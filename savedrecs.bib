Abstract = {{In experiments on mice spinal cord slices, it was found that intense
   apoptosis of motoneurons develops in these slices rather rapidly (6
   hours). This process can be significantly suppressed by treatment with
   the NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist MK-801 (50 mu M) and AMPA/kainite
   non-NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist CNQX (100 mu M). Such treatment
   considerably increased the percentage of viable motoneurons in the
   ventral horns of the spinal cord. The results obtained confirm the
   statement that glutamate excitotoxicity could be a significant possible
   factor responsible for apoptosis of motoneurons under conditions of
   spinal cord impairment.}},

   both a necessary aspect of ontological analysis and necessarily reshaped

   implied by a turn to things and to ontology has tended to `reassemble
   the social' apolitically as well as symmetrically, at least in
   archaeology, this is not due to a lack of potential. In this article I
   will investigate the ontology and semiotics of Shang visual culture and
   its participation in structuring and manifesting local hierarchies of
   being. I will use the phenomenon of skeumorphy to both problematize
   common Western assumptions about the nature of representation and to
   explore early Chinese patterns of power and mediation.}},

Abstract = {{.The issues addressed in the articles in this special issue indicate the
   many ways in which vocational forms of higher education (HiVE) are

   the forms of provision considered here are claims that they provide
   alternative insights into opportunities and inequalities within higher
   education (HE) and society. They suggest that HiVE is distinctive from
   dominant forms of HE in universities, and may therefore contribute to
   addressing inequity. As this suggests, while HiVE is often positioned in
   relation to what it is not, a more positive reading highlights HiVE's
   capacity to address social and economic inequalities, particularly
   through providing access to skilled work. Claims to distinctiveness,
   however, which focus primarily on access to skilled work may lead to a
   reductive understanding both of HiVE and the aspirations of those who

Abstract = {{This article explores the academic identities of college educators of
   higher education in vocational institutions. Qualitative semi-structured
   interviews generated data from eleven educators in five vocational
   education institutions. Discourse analysis revealed that educators
   distinguished their vocational institutions' contributions to HE as
   different, but equal or superior to those of universities. Educators
   presented their culture and practices in advantageous ways, contrasted
   against imagined stereotypes of university experiences, which are
   perceived to be deficient for supporting the types of students they
   teach. In adopting academic identities that distinguish their cultures
   and practices from those presumed prevalent in universities, these
   educators seek parity of esteem with universities through
   distinctiveness, and reject research-focused academic identities and
   academic drift. In embracing teacherly identities supporting students
   rather than the research-teaching nexus, educators may be contributing
   to the `therapeutic turn', diminishing opportunities for students, and
   furthering the vertical stratification of institutions within the
   Australian HE space.}},

Journal = {{NEUROPHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Signaling pathways of neurons depend on such factors as the type and
   ``strength{''} of the synapse, cable properties, distribution of ion
   channels, and biophysical parameters involved. Aggregation of
   amyloidbeta (A beta) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) dramatically affects
   the functioning of neurons (hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in
   particular) in multiple ways, which results in loss of memory and
   cognitive intelligence. To date, the respective available cell models
   have been focused on individual channel mechanisms involved, without
   considering the combined effect of those. Due to this, exact information
   on the respective dysfunction caused in the cell was limited. Therefore,
   we adopted a methodology analogous to that in studies of neural
   networks, which takes into account different combinations of the channel
   mechanisms, to address changes in the number of action potentials (APs)
   generated (AP counts) in the model. We have taken into consideration
   decreases in the conductance of A-type potassium channels (K-A), delayed
   rectifier potassium channels (K-DR), and sodium channels (Na) in
   succession to simulate the effect of agglomeration of A beta. At the
   same time, we tried to include individual calcium channels, namely
   L-type (CaL), N-type (CaN), T-type (CaT), and calcium-sensitive
   potassium channels (Cagk) in unique combinations to identify the
   behavior and significance of each channel for different input-output
   relations at locations on the soma and proximal dendrites of the cell.
   Each of these steps were taken at four distinct AD-influenced stages
   (30, 60, 90, and 100\%). In this study, we found that decreases in the
   conductance of K-A channels induces hyperexcitability, while decreases
   in the conductance of K-DR and Na channels induce hypoexcitability of
   the neuron. In comparison with K-DR, Na channels are highly responsive
   to CaL, CaN, CaT, and Cagk, and the respective effects are rather
   significant. In this model, the effects of compensation or rectification
   on A beta accumulation were brought about by three methods: first, by
   altering the conductance of Na channels, second, by reducing the
   amplitude of input current, and finally, by an equitable combination of
   both. We found that a higher amount of compensation is required to
   restore the normal AP counts of the cell under the influence of CaL, as
   compared with the effects of CaN channels (when each of these are
   individually included). The model anticipates the potential therapeutic
   treatments in terms of pharmacological modifications of the channel
   kinetics.}},

Abstract = {{This article explores the materiality of the Orthodox Christian cult of
   the Epitaphios on Good Friday of 2020 when, during the COVID-19
   pandemic, social distancing and isolation were deemed the most effective
   means of protecting societies from exposure to the virus. Epitaphios is
   a metonym that references a venerated object, a decorated cloth or
   wooden icon bearing the image of Christ prepared for burial. It is
   placed upon a wooden bier, representing the Tomb of Christ, also called
   the Epitaphios. During the pandemic, people reacted inventively to
   restrictions imposed on practicing this communal cult publicly in
   churches by constructing homemade Epitaphioi and displaying them in
   privately-owned spaces. We examine the materiality of the homemade
   Epitaphioi in the context of popular religion, evaluating how crisis may
   divert the forces of the longue duree into a different channel, and how
   ethnographic analogy may be useful for understanding ritual and cult in
   archaeology.}},

Abstract = {{Skin aging may be divided into intrinsic and extrinsic aging or
   photoaging. The first is a natural, slow and gradual process. The second
   is exacerbated by environmental factors such as improper exposure to
   sunlight. There are a myriad of therapeutic modalities that can improve
   photoaging. Intense pulsed light, radiofrequency and carboxytherapy are
   good procedural modalities to improve skin aging. This study aimed to
   evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of IPL, RF, and
   carboxytherapy in facial rejuvenation. This study included 60 patients
   with facial wrinkles. Patients were divided into three groups. Group 1
   was treated with IPL, group 2 was treated with radiofrequency while
   group 3 was treated with carboxytherapy. All patients received four
   sessions with 3-4 week interval and followed up after 3 months after the
   end of treatment. Patients were assessed by digital photographing and
   skin biopsies before and after treatment. There was a significant
   difference in the percentage of improvement and patients' satisfaction
   with more significance in group 1, followed by group 3 then group 2. IPL
   was the more effective, followed by carboxytherapy then RF at the end in
   facial rejuvenation. These results were confirmed by immunohistochemical
   expression of MMP1.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{55}},

Abstract = {{Growing anthropogenic impacts on natural and semi-natural ecosystems
   have created a network of degraded sites throughout the world. These
   disturbed ecosystems are often colonized by invasive plants such as
   Pteridium aquilinum, which is one of the most widespread plants
   worldwide. In northern Iran, P. aquilinum is often found invading
   newly-created habitats formed after anthropogenic disturbance. This
   study aimed to assess the relationship between P. aquilinum performance
   and a range of environmental factors (soils, climate, topography and
   land-use) in northern Iran. In fifteen sites dominated by P. aquilinum,
   that spanned the regional distribution of P. aquilinum, we measured its
   cover, density and biomass. Pteridium aquilinum was found to occur in a
   variety of land-uses including abandoned agricultural lands, degraded
   forests and upland rangelands. The performance of P. aquilinum varied
   significantly between the sites and it performed better in a
   moderate-Mediterranean climate. Variation partitioning confirmed the
   importance of climate followed by soil and land-use in explaining the
   performance of P. aquilinum. Topographic variables did not show any
   significant effect on P. aquilinum. Both temperature and rainfall
   affected P. aquilinum performance. Density was correlated positively
   with early-spring rainfall whereas biomass and cover were found to have
   positive correlation with temperature. There was also a gradient of soil
   texture/pH/N/P influencing P. aquilinum. Frond density and biomass were
   correlated positively with sand content, N and P, but negatively with
   pH, lime and bulk density. Thus, soil conditions alongside temperature
   in spring and early summer could explain P. aquilinum cover, but for
   density, rainfall in early spring was the most important factor,
   suggesting that in northern Iran P. aquilinum performance appears to be
   intermediate compared to responses reported for temperate
   (temperature-controlled) and tropical climates (rainfall-controlled).}},

Abstract = {{Facial erythema from rosacea and acne is one of the most common problems
   encountered in dermatologic clinics. Effective therapeutic interventions
   for persistent erythema, which can cause patients frustration and
   psychological distress, are needed. The aim of this study was to
   evaluate the efficacy and safety of an invasive short pulsed-type
   bipolar radiofrequency device (IPBRF) for the treatment of intractable
   facial erythema. Thirty-one patients who had been diagnosed with rosacea
   or acne vulgaris and combined erythema underwent at least two IPBRF
   treatment sessions (maximum: 5) at 2-week intervals. Treatment outcomes
   were evaluated by investigator global assessment (IGA) based on clinical
   photographs, patient global assessment (PGA) score, and skin biophysical
   parameters including erythema index (EI), melanin index (MI), and
   transepidermal water loss (TEWL). Most patients showed significant
   clinical improvement. IGA scores for erythema, pores and smoothness
   improved after treatment. PGA also showed a trend toward improvement.
   Mean EI was significantly improved after the second treatment compared
   to baseline, which maintained until the study period. MI and TEWL showed
   a tendency toward improvement. There were no serious adverse events
   reported during the study. IPBRF led to rapid clinical improvement in
   facial erythema associated with rosacea and acne vulgaris and could be
   an effective and safe treatment option.}},

Abstract = {{At Dreamer's Bay on the Akrotiri Peninsula of Cyprus lie remains of what
   has been interpreted as a, perhaps the main, port for Roman and early
   Byzantine Kourion. New research reveals a significantly different
   picture. This was not a nucleated port town as sometimes assumed, but a
   concentration of maritime facilities with a variety of functions,
   including an artificially enhanced (but still mediocre) harbour, and
   shoreline installations partly facilitating Kourion's commerce in
   commodities like wine and oil. It was also partly an industrial
   landscape focused on stone quarries above the bay and, perhaps equally
   important, a proposed watering and victualling stop for long-haul
   shipping between the Aegean, Egypt and the Levant. Dreamer's Bay was
   hardly a distinct `site' or `place', but rather a commercial/industrial
   zone forming part of an integrated landscape of settlement and activity
   spanning the entire peninsula, which itself constituted a major maritime
   crossroads in the eastern Mediterranean.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{40}},

Abstract = {{The genus Wakaleo represents a close outgroup to the charismatic
   marsupial hypercarnivore Thylacoleo carnifex. While early species of
   Wakaleo were likely arboreal, or at least scansorial, the ecology of
   later species of Wakaleo is not well understood. Here we present
   descriptions of new postcranial material of W. vanderleueri and W.
   alcootaensis from mid- and late-Miocene fossil deposits from the
   Australian Northern Territory. New calculations suggest that these taxa
   were smaller than previously thought, around 30 kg and 50 kg
   respectively. The postcrania reveal increasing adaptation towards
   terrestrial locomotion and felid-like grappling predation within this
   lineage, in contrast to the more canid-like adaptations occurring at
   around the same time in the other major group of terrestrial marsupial
   carnivores, the thylacinids. This hypothesis seems to reflect similar
   patterns of divergent morphological adaptation towards large carnivorous
   forms among placental mammals, and highlights a greater diversity in the
   evolutionary history of medium to large sized marsupial carnivores
   during the Miocene in Australia than previously recognized.}},

Abstract = {{The endorsement/affirmation of the Global Compact on Migration and the
   Global Compact for Refugees in December 2018 has been accompanied by an
   intense discussion about the need to introduce new norms in these fields
   and about the actual legal force of the respective provisions. There was
   and there persists an open contrast between the openly declared
   non-bindingness of these Compacts and the widespread fear that they
   would either severally constrain national sovereignty in highly delicate
   areas or dilute arduously achieved standards (especially with regard to
   refugee law). Eventually, this whole discussion leads to the question
   about the meaning and the status of soft law in international law. With
   regard to the European Union, the transformative impact of the Global
   Compacts will depend on whether the EU further proceeds on its path of
   ``emancipation{''} from international law while internally finding no
   consensus on the values here at issue.}},

   lives and made tens of thousands sick. The new coronavirus has already
   reached Angola, with 25 confirmed cases, among them 2 died and 6 were
   cured. The government has decreed a state of emergency on 24 March 2020
   for 15 days, which was extended twice for the same number of days that
   will make it possible to reduce clusters of people and keep them at
   home. This study reflected on the diverse ways of leadership. It is an
   article of theoretical, technical and scientific reflection, based on
   the experience of a new epidemiological situation, with a critical
   analysis based on technical, scientific and professional experience,
   with bibliographic input of data obtained from information published in
   scientific articles, newspapers, magazines and other official documents
   published in Angola and worldwide related to COVID-19. This article
   emerged from critical thinking based on the current situation of
   COVID-19 in Angola in the world and is reflected in this article, what

Abstract = {{This article explores the medieval Chinese perception of `Japan' in both

   one based out of the court and another rooted in the Buddhist community.
   This comparative exercise will further highlight the utility of using
   state and Buddhist texts when exploring the treatment of foreign
   polities from the Chinese perspective. In addition, these resources can
   be aligned with contemporary Japanese sources to further evaluate and
   confirm details and narratives. This article will argue that major
   Chinese Buddhist interest in Japan commenced from the tenth century,
   which was due to connections between Tiantai and Tendai, although
   recorded testimonies from the ninth century demonstrate that this
   relationship originated during the late Tang.}},

Abstract = {{This article uses the analytical framework of hermeneutic hagiography to

   Laiguo was a Buddhist leader who could turn the tide in a time of
   crisis. In him, the typical charismatic personality shows the
   individual's rebellion against the legitimacy of the external world. The
   experiences Laiguo suffered are just as typical an aspect as charisma is
   in the processes of `dilemma' and `passion.' Those who experience
   suffering are trying to find a new beginning in the desperate situation
   of life and determine the fundamental principles of human social
   relations through their struggles and efforts when facing desperate

Abstract = {{Concealed fecundity and extended female sexual receptivity have evolved
   in some primates, including humans, conferring advantages both within
   primarily monogamous relationships (e.g., benefits from paternity
   assurance) and from extrapair liaisons (e.g., better access to good
   genes). As humans evolved the intellectual capacity for decision-making,
   women became capable of altering their own fertility. In some
   circumstances, they may choose to ameliorate risks and responsibilities
   associated with pregnancy by reducing sexual motivation near the
   perceived most fecund time of their menstrual cycle. But three
   findings-a general inability of women to accurately recognize their own
   intervals of fecundity, high variability in ovulation timing, and
   unconscious transmission and reception of cues associated with
   fecundity-constitute a physiological and behavioral syndrome that can be
   considered self-deception. In this study, I develop a descriptive model
   to determine implications of the hypothesis that these features of
   female and male physiology and behavior have been shaped by natural
   selection in response to female decision-making. My analysis shows that
   consensus motivation for coitus between partners influences both the
   importance of variable ovulation date and the probability of conception,
   under the influence of self-deception. It also identifies priorities for
   future empirical work.}},

Abstract = {{Using empirical data from archival research and rural fieldwork in
   Chipata district (former Fort Jameson district) in Zambia, this article
   explores historical processes shaping smallholders' contemporary
   livelihood situations. Contemporary issues such as food insecurity,
   environmental degradation, lack of markets and inputs are investigated
   from a historical perspective. The article highlights colonial policies
   as decisive in shaping the physical, social and economic landscape of
   the study area. Policies such as the creation of native reserves, land
   alienation and European settlement, taxes and market regulations had a
   deep impact on smallholders' livelihoods and are to a large extent still
   influencing the study area. Furthermore, it is suggested that livelihood
   diversification among smallholders in the study area is a contemporary
   expression of a historical process of semi-proletarianisation, rather
   than a response to postcolonial policies, which is generally suggested
   in the literature. Findings show that the `othering' of African
   smallholders during the colonial period has been reproduced into present
   policies in the study area. Overall, the article argues that research on
   rural livelihoods gain from adopting a historical perspective; in
   understanding the long-term impact of colonial rule and in understanding
   of how postcolonial policies are formulated and by what impact they are
   implemented.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: This work aims to explore the biological role of negative pressure
   wound therapy (NPWT) in the treatment of diabetic ulcer. Materials \&
   methods: Full-thickness skin defects were created in diabetic (db/db)
   and non diabetic (db/m) mice to create wound models. The mice were
   received NPWT or rapamycin injection. Mouse macrophage cells (Raw264.7)
   were treated with lipopolysaccharide to induce inflammatory response,
   and then received negative pressure treatment. We observed the wound
   healing of mice and examined gene and protein expression and CD68(+)
   macrophage levels. Results: NPWT notably enhanced the wound closure
   ratio, and inhibited the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and Beclin-1 expression in
   diabetes mellitus (DM) mice. NPWT decreased CD68(+) macrophage levels in
   wound tissues of DM mice. The influence conferred by NPWT was abolished
   by rapamycin treatment. Negative pressure repressed the LC3-II/LC3-I
   ratio and the expression of Beclin-1, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1 beta in
   the Raw264.7 cells. Conclusion: NPWT promotes wound healing by
   suppressing autophagy and macrophage inflammation in DM.}},

Abstract = {{In the unit viewing sphere imaging model, the projection of a space
   sphere includes the sphere image and its antipodal sphere image. As the
   pair of sphere images are separated, they have only one common

   based on the projection of the space sphere is proposed, which involves
   using a paracatadioptric camera. The proposed method requires two images
   of the space sphere from different positions to obtain a homography
   matrix. This homography matrix has eight degrees of freedom, and a line
   correspondence pair provides two constraints. Hence, using four pairs of
   line correspondences, the homography matrix can be solved, and the
   external parameters can be obtained. The effectiveness of the proposed
   method is verified through simulation and experiments using real images.}},

Abstract = {{This two-phased study explored a corpus-driven, curriculum-based
   approach to assessing proficiency development of Mandarin Chinese in US
   universities. In Phase I, we developed an elicited imitation (EI) test
   based on the Chinese curriculum at a large US university. This test
   demonstrated higher psychometric qualities to (1) place L2 learners into
   three curricular levels, and (2) assess learners' production of key
   vocabulary and grammatical items, providing useful information for
   placement, diagnosis, and achievement purposes as compared with a
   non-curriculum-based EI test. In Phase II, we revised the EI test to
   make it applicable across university contexts. We identified a
   lexico-grammar core from a corpus-driven analysis of 36 widely-used
   Chinese textbooks in US universities and incorporated this core in EI
   item development. The revised EI test showed improved psychometric
   qualities. This study has broad methodological implications for the
   assessment of Chinese as well as other less commonly taught languages in
   university contexts.}},

Abstract = {{The need to account for a misalignment between the heat flux density and
   temperature gradient vectors when studying thermal conductivity of
   anisotropic materials was analyzed. A method for measuring thermal
   conductivity of pyrolytic graphite (grade UPV-1) in the direction

   proposed method is the possibility to determine thermal conductivity of
   pyrolytic graphite in the direction parallel to the precipitation plane
   while accounting for a misalignment between the heat flux density and
   temperature gradient vectors. The test samples were shaped as hollow
   cylinders with the pyrolytic graphite precipitation plane located along
   the radius of the cylinder. The heat flux density was determined based
   on the radiation heat flux emitted from the outer surface of the sample,
   and the temperature gradient was calculated along the radius, which made
   it possible to maintain the alignment between the heat flux density and
   temperature gradient vectors. A comparative analysis of the thermal
   conductivity values obtained in this study (parallel to the
   precipitation plane) and those reported in the reference sources was
   performed. The studied temperature range was extended into the higher
   temperature region by 450 K and constitutes 1900-2950 K.}},

Abstract = {{Background Unless clinical trials are well-designed, there is a risk
   that they will not be usable to improve patient care.
   Aim This paper discusses some factors important in designing clinical
   trials in paediatric dentistry. It uses the prevention and management of
   dental caries in children as the lens through which to look at these.
   Findings Amongst the factors to consider are clear research questions
   and objectives; appropriate outcomes and outcome measures; sample size
   calculation and the level of randomisation; methods for random
   allocation; and operator/assessor training. Experts in trial design
   including statisticians and a trialist should be consulted early in the
   design process. The aspects of trial design unique to cariology trials
   such as `clustering' of data items, mixed dentition issues and those
   related to trials involving children (communication, consent etc) should
   be considered. Comprehensive reporting of trial results is essential.
   Conclusion There are many readily available resources and tools to help
   the researcher design a trial of good quality that will yield results
   useful to the research community and beyond, to those who will implement
   the findings and ultimately those who will benefit from them.}},

Abstract = {{Two prominent theoretical frameworks in moral psychology, Moral
   Foundations and Dual Process Theory, share a broad foundational
   assumption that individual differences in human morality are
   dispositional and in part due to genetic variation. The only published
   direct test of heritability, however, found little evidence of genetic
   influences on moral judgments using instrumentation approaches
   associated with Moral Foundations Theory. This raised questions about
   one of the core assumptions underpinning intuitionist theories of moral
   psychology. Here we examine the heritability of moral psychology using
   the moral dilemmas approach commonly used in Dual Process Theory
   research. Using such measures, we find consistent and significant
   evidence of heritability. These findings have important implications not
   only for understanding which measures do, or do not, tap into the
   genetically influenced aspects of moral decision-making, but in better
   establishing the utility and validity of different intuitionist
   theoretical frameworks and the source of why people differ in those
   frameworks.}},

Abstract = {{It seems clear to many analysts that there are several existential and
   many `normalized' threats to wellbeing of individuals, societies and
   environments-such as disruption from climate change, diseases from
   manufactured foods and species losses linked to habitat destruction-that
   have been associated with fields of science, mathematics and technology
   (and, likely, engineering). Culpability for such threats, while perhaps
   engaging much of humanity, seems most likely attributable to
   pro-capitalist individuals (e.g., financiers) and groups (e.g.,
   corporations and transnational trade organizations)-which appear to have
   relatively successfully influenced most living and nonliving entities to
   form assemblages (dispositifs) that serve their self-interested
   ideologies. Given harms associated with such assemblages, it seems clear
   to many analysts that they need to be severely disrupted or, perhaps,
   replaced with alliances of entities that are based on ideological
   perspectives that may contribute to comprehensive wellbeing. Although
   pro-capitalist assemblages have been extremely resilient, it seems that
   current sociopolitical instability and, moreover, considerable
   disruption from the CoViD-19 pandemic may provide unprecedented
   opportunities for dramatic changes. In this article, after consideration
   of characteristics and extents of harms linked to fields of science,
   mathematics and technology/engineering, possibilities are described and
   critically defended for uses of a particular curriculum and pedagogical
   framework for helping students to imagine and, perhaps, realize new
   assemblages of entities that are held together by ideologies that they
   consider appropriate.}},

Abstract = {{This article explores the question of literary criticism in the context
   of interactions between literature and philosophy. The best example of
   such interaction is the legacy of the early twentieth century Russian
   literary critic, Yuly Aykhenvald (1872-1928). This article gives a brief
   overview of his works of literary criticism and their thematic
   repertoire. Aykhenvald's philosophical background, professional
   education, and personal connections with renowned Russian thinkers,
   including Vladimir Solovyov, Fyodor Stepun, and Semyon Frank, are
   included in an evaluation of Aykhenvald's position on one of the most
   discussed relationships in Russian culture-that of Russia and the West.
   The issue of relations between the West and Russia acquired a particular
   urgency after the October Revolution of 1917, when Russian culture split
   into two realms-Soviet and emigre. This article analyzes Aykhenvald's
   position on this issue, which is present in both his philosophical
   responses to the Eurasianists and in his essays written on the occasion
   of the 125th anniversary of Pushkin's birth. Throughout the mid-1920s
   Aykhenvald wrote that Pushkin was the ideal of spiritual and aesthetic
   balance. In Pushkin's work Aykhenvald found the embodiment of his own
   historiosophical aspirations-the harmonious fusion of Russia and the
   West.}},

Abstract = {{Background Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal disease of
   cats that can be very difficult to definitively diagnose antemortem.
   Multiplex fluorescent immunocytochemical (MF-ICC) assays are emerging as
   useful diagnostic tests in veterinary medicine, particularly for fluid
   samples.
   Objective We aimed to develop and optimize an MF-ICC assay to detect
   feline coronavirus within macrophages, with the primary goal of
   determining the allowable/recommended sample storage conditions for
   clinical use of this assay.
   Methods A feline macrophage cell line was infected with the FIP virus.
   Following harvest into EDTA tubes (simulating typical clinical
   collection of effusion), cells were stored at 4celcius, 22celcius, and
   37celcius. For each temperature condition, slides for MF-ICC were made
   at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 days post-collection. To assess the stability of
   immunoreactivity following fixation, freshly harvested infected cells
   were fixed onto slides and maintained at 4celcius for 1, 2, 4, and 12
   weeks. All slides were analyzed by MF-ICC for the presence of
   mononuclear cells with co-expression of vimentin and coronaviral
   antigen.
   Results MF-ICC confirmed that cells tested positive for coronavirus at
   4celcius through 3 days post-harvest, 22celcius through 48 hours
   post-harvest, and 37celcius through 24 hours post-harvest. The MF-ICC
   assay was successfully performed on fixed slides through the 12-week
   time point. This assay also demonstrated positive results on a clinical
   sample of abdominal fluid from a cat later confirmed to have FIP.
   Conclusions The MF-ICC assay described here offers a potentially
   specific and relatively stable antemortem diagnostic test for feline
   infectious peritonitis. Evaluation of this assay in clinical samples is
   ongoing.}},

Abstract = {{Unconventional reservoirs are generally characterized by low matrix
   porosity and permeability, in which natural fractures are important
   factors for gas production. In this study, we analyzed characteristics
   of natural fractures, and their influencing factors based on
   observations from outcrops, cores and image logs. The orientations of
   natural fractures were mainly in the similar to N-S, WNW-ESE and NE-SW
   directions with relatively high fracture dip angles. Fracture densities
   were calculated based on fracture measurements within cores, indicating
   that natural fractures were not well-developed in the Benxi-Upper
   Shihezi Formations of Linxing Block. The majority of natural fractures
   were open fractures and unfilled. According to the characteristics of
   fracture sets and tectonic evolution of the study area, natural
   fractures in the Linxing Block were mainly formed in the Yanshanian and
   Himalayan periods. The lithology and layer thickness influenced the
   development of natural fractures, and more natural fractures were
   generated in carbonate rocks and thin layers in the study area. In
   addition, in the Linxing Block, natural fractures with similar to
   N-S-trending strikes contributed little to the overall subsurface fluid
   flow under the present-day stress state. These study results provide a
   geological basis for gas exploration and development in the Linxing
   unconventional reservoirs of Ordos Basin.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To identify the bacterial and fungal pathogens in ocular
   samples of clinically suspected endophthalmitis patients by conventional
   and 16S and 28S rDNA gene sequencing respectively.
   Methods: A total of 88 patients with clinically suspected
   endophthalmitis patients were included in this study. Under sterile
   operating conditions, a vitreous fluid (0.1-0.2 ml) was obtained by pars
   plana vitrectomy procedure. The samples were processed for conventional
   microbiology methods and PCR. PCR targeting 16S rDNA gene for bacteria
   and 28S rDNA gene for fungus was performed individually using the
   MightyAmp DNA Polymerase Ver. 2 (TaKaRa China) kit. The PCR amplified
   samples were sequenced and aligned using CLUSTAL-W tool. The
   phylogenetic tree was constructed by Neighborhood joining along with the
   reference sequences downloaded from NCBI database using MEGA X software.
   Results: The patients consisting of 67 Post-operative, 12 Endogenous and
   9 traumatic endophthalmitis were included as study subject. By the
   direct culturing bacterial growth was observed in 17 samples and fungal
   growth in three samples. PCR was positive for all the culture positive
   samples, in addition 14 were positive in culture negative samples. The
   predominant species identified in gram-positive bacteria was
   Staphylococcus spp., and Pseudomonas spp., in the gram-negative group.
   PCR and culture identify only three samples positive for fungal
   pathogens which was identified as Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida
   albicans, and Exerohilum rostratum.
   Conclusions: PCR based molecular diagnosis are more sensitive than the
   conventional gold standard culture methods in endophthalmitis. Bacterial
   pathogens were found to be the predominant in causing endophthalmitis
   than fungal pathogens.}},

Abstract = {{Aeolian processes have been studied extensively at low elevations, but
   have been relatively little studied at high elevations. Aeolian
   sediments are widely distributed in the Yarlung Zangbo River basin,
   southern Tibetan Plateau, which is characterized by low pressure and low
   temperature. Here, we comprehensively analyzed the wind regime using
   data since 1980 from 11 meteorological stations in the study area, and
   examined the interaction between the near-surface wind and aeolian
   environment. The wind environment exhibited significant spatial and
   temporal variation, and mean wind speed has generally decreased on both
   annual and seasonal bases since 1980, at an average of 0.181 m/(s center
   dot 10a). This decrease resulted from the reduced contribution of
   maximum wind speed, and depended strongly on variations of the frequency
   of sand-driving winds. The drift potential and related parameters also
   showed obvious spatial and temporal variation, with similar driving
   forces for the wind environment. The strength of the wind regime
   affected the formation and development of the aeolian geomorphological
   pattern, but with variation caused by local topography and sediment
   sources. The drift potential and resultant drift direction were two key
   parameters, as they quantify the dynamic conditions and depositional
   orientation of the aeolian sediments. Wind affected the spatial
   variation in sediment grain size, but the source material and complex
   topographic effects on the near-surface wind were the underlying causes
   for the grain size distribution of aeolian sands. These results will
   support efforts to control aeolian desertification in the basin and
   improve our understanding of aeolian processes in high-elevation
   environments.}},

Title = {{Causal inference in high dimensions: A marriage between Bayesian
   modeling and good frequentist properties}},
Journal = {{BIOMETRICS}},
Abstract = {{We introduce a framework for estimating causal effects of binary and
   continuous treatments in high dimensions. We show how posterior
   distributions of treatment and outcome models can be used together with
   doubly robust estimators. We propose an approach to uncertainty
   quantification for the doubly robust estimator, which utilizes posterior
   distributions of model parameters and (1) results in good frequentist
   properties in small samples, (2) is based on a single run of a Markov
   chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, and (3) improves over frequentist
   measures of uncertainty which rely on asymptotic properties. We consider
   a flexible framework for modeling the treatment and outcome processes
   within the Bayesian paradigm that reduces model dependence, accommodates
   nonlinearity, and achieves dimension reduction of the covariate space.
   We illustrate the ability of the proposed approach to flexibly estimate
   causal effects in high dimensions and appropriately quantify
   uncertainty. We show that our proposed variance estimation strategy is

Abstract = {{Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are implicated in atherosclerotic
   plaque rupture and recondition. Specific tissue inhibitors (TIMPs)
   control MMP functions. Both MMPs and TIMPs are potential biomarkers of
   plaque instability. Elevated Apo-CII and CIII and Apo-E levels are
   recognized as cardiovascular disease risk factors. We aimed to establish
   the best blood biomarker panel to evaluate the coronary artery disease
   (CAD) severity. Plasma levels of MMP-3 and MMP-9, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2,
   Apo-CII, Apo-CIII and Apo-E were measured in 472 patients with CAD
   evaluated by coronary angiography and electrocardiography, and in 285
   healthy controls. MMP-3 and MMP-9 plasma levels in CAD patients were
   significantly increased (P < 0.001) compared to controls (3.54- and
   3.81-fold, respectively). Furthermore, these increments are modulated by
   CAD severity as well as for Apo-CII and Apo-CIII levels (P < 0.001).
   TIMPs levels were decreased in CAD versus controls (P < 0.001) and in
   inverse correlation to MMPs. Standard ROC curve approach showed the
   importance of panels of biomarkers, including MMP-3, MMP-9, TIMP-1,
   TIMP-2, Apo-CII and Apo-CIII, for disease aggravation diagnosis. A high
   area under curve (AUC) value (0.995) was reached for the association of
   MMP-9, TIMP-2 and Apo-CIII. The unbalance between MMPs and TIMPs in
   vascular wall and dyslipidaemia creates favourable conditions for plaque
   disruption. Our study suggests that the combination of MMP-9, TIMP-2 and
   Apo-CIII values ('CAD aggravation panel') characterizes the severity of
   CAD, that is electrophysiological state, number of involved vessels,
   stent disposal and type of stent.}},

Title = {{Caregivers' perceptions of the relationship among weight, health status,
   and asthma in their children}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHILD HEALTH CARE}},
Abstract = {{Asthma and obesity are the two most common childhood illnesses and are
   physiologically interrelated. Few studies have assessed parental
   perceptions and beliefs about this relationship to better target
   education and therapy. This study aimed to determine caregiver beliefs
   and perceptions regarding weight, health status, and asthma diagnoses.
   Data from a survey of caregivers to children aged 4-11 years are merged
   with corresponding anthropometric and medical data from the electronic
   medical record. Caregivers of children with asthma completed a
   supplemental questionnaire. Univariable and multivariable logistic
   regressions were used to evaluate associations between perception of
   health problem, asthma, and weight status. Increased weight status was
   >= 85th body mass index percentile per Centers for Disease Control
   classifications. Compared to caregivers of healthy children and those of
   children with healthy weight and asthma, caregivers of dual diagnosis
   children were more likely to identify weight as a health problem (OR =
   3.89, 95\% confidence interval {[}1.48, 10.21]). Nevertheless, only 31\%
   of caregivers of children with dual diagnosis believed weight
   contributed to the severity of their child's asthma. Less than one third
   of caregivers of dual diagnosis children believed that these diagnoses
   are interrelated. Addressing this gap in understanding is a critical
   next step to developing family-centered interventions.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 31}},
Abstract = {{It is believed that the approximate estimation of large sets and the
   exact quantification of small sets (subitizing) are supported by two
   different systems, the Approximate Number System (ANS) and Object
   Tracking System (OTS), respectively. It is a current matter of debate
   whether they are both impaired in developmental dyscalculia (DD), a
   specific learning disability in symbolic number processing and
   calculation. Here we tackled this question by asking 32 DD children and
   32 controls to perform a series of tasks on visually presented sets,
   including exact enumeration of small sets as well as comparison of
   large, uncountable sets. In children with DD, we found poor sensitivity
   in processing large numerosities, but we failed to find impairments in
   the exact enumeration of sets within the subitizing range. We also
   observed deficits in visual short-term memory skills in children with
   dyscalculia that, however, did not account for their low ANS acuity.
   Taken together, these results point to a dissociation between
   quantification skills in dyscalculia, they highlight a link between DD
   and low ANS acuity and provide support for the notion that DD is a
   multifaceted disability that covers multiple cognitive skills.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL FIBERS}},
Abstract = {{The extraction of natural dye using an aqueous method is a concept of
   green chemistry to avoid environmental pollution and toxicity. The
   present study was performed to improve the color strength and fastness
   properties of the fabrics by using natural dye and banana pseudo stem
   sap as a natural mordant. The natural dye was extracted from marigold
   flowers (Tagetes erecta) and optimized for dyeing of cotton and silk
   fabrics. The extraction of the dye was done in an aqueous solution
   without using any solvents. The optimum results were obtained when the
   fabric was dyed at 80 degrees C for 60 min by keeping the mass to liquid
   ratio 1:40 at pH-7 (1.19). The color strength and CIELab (L{*}, a{*},
   and b{*}) color parameters were also investigated. The effect of banana
   pseudo stem saps as a natural mordant on the color strength and fastness
   properties of the cotton and silk fabrics were evaluated and compared.
   The cotton fabrics were further characterized by FTIR spectroscopy and
   Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to assess the physical and chemical
   changes after dyeing and mordanting.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines musical episodes occurring in a family with two
   young children, collected and analysed through the Language Environment

   musical interactions, based on the recorded soundscape of Anna and her
   younger brother, Albert. The data includes 26 hours of audio recording

   each child. Four themes emerged from the data analysis: (1) the type of
   engagement; (2) siblings' roles; (3) children's repertoire; and (4) car
   rides as a family setting. We hope to support and inform parents and
   teachers, making them aware of rich musical interactions among children

Abstract = {{Dietary nitrate lowers blood pressure and improves athletic performance
   in humans, yet data supporting observations that it may increase
   cerebral blood flow and improve cognitive performance are mixed. We
   tested the hypothesis that nitrate and nitrite treatment would improve
   indicators of learning and cognitive performance in a zebrafish (Danio
   rerio) model. We utilized targeted and untargeted liquid
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis to examine
   the extent to which treatment resulted in changes in nitrate or nitrite
   concentrations in the brain and altered the brain metabolome. Fish were
   exposed to sodium nitrate (606.9 mg/L), sodium nitrite (19.5 mg/L), or
   control water for 2-4 weeks and free swim, startle response, and shuttle
   box assays were performed. Nitrate and nitrite treatment did not change
   fish weight, length, predator avoidance, or distance and velocity
   traveled in an unstressed environment. Nitrate- and nitrite-treated fish
   initially experienced more negative reinforcement and increased time to
   decision in the shuttle box assay, which is consistent with a decrease
   in associative learning or executive function however, over multiple
   trials, all treatment groups demonstrated behaviors associated with
   learning. Nitrate and nitrite treatment was associated with mild
   anxiogenic-like behavior but did not alter epinephrine, norepinephrine
   or dopamine levels. Targeted metabolomics analysis revealed no
   significant increase in brain nitrate or nitrite concentrations with
   treatment. Untargeted metabolomics analysis found 47 metabolites whose
   abundance was significantly altered in the brain with nitrate and
   nitrite treatment. Overall, the depletion in brain metabolites is
   plausibly associated with the regulation of neuronal activity including
   statistically significant reductions in the inhibitory neurotransmitter
   gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA; 18-19\%), and its precursor, glutamine
   (17-22\%). Nitrate treatment caused significant depletion in the brain
   concentration of fatty acids including linoleic acid (LA) by 50\% and
   arachidonic acid (ARA) by 80\%; nitrite treatment caused depletion of LA
   by similar to 90\% and ARA by 60\%, change which could alter the
   function of dopaminergic neurons and affect behavior. Nitrate and
   nitrite treatment did not adversely affect multiple parameters of
   zebrafish health. It is plausible that indirect NO-mediated mechanisms
   may be responsible for the nitrate and nitrite-mediated effects on the
   brain metabolome and behavior in zebrafish.}},

Title = {{Investigation of a granular Bond number based rheological model for

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Granular materials are used in many industrial processes among various
   fields, such as pharmaceutical, food, metallurgy or nuclear fuel
   production. However, compared to other commonly used media, such as
   liquids, powders are known to behave unpredictably, leading to
   uncontrolled process operations. Since the flow behavior of the powders
   originates from interparticle forces, we suggest a model, linking the
   macroscopic flowability of powder beds, and the properties of the
   microscopic particles constituting the powder. A population dependent
   granular Bond number (Capece et al., 2016), that takes into account the
   particles properties such as the particles' true density, surface
   energy, rugosity and the whole particle size distribution, is used. This
   non-dimensional number was found to correlate well with the flowability
   of polydispersed powder bed, which can be measured by shear testing with
   a Freeman FT4 (R) powder rheometer. The results found in previous
   studies (Bernard-Granger et al., 2019; Capece et al., 2016) are extended
   and discussed using five different oxide powders exhibiting various flow
   behaviors. In particular, a short sensitivity analysis of the model is
   carried out. The results show that the fraction of fine particles within
   a polydispersed powder is a critical parameter for the flowability of
   the powder bed. Finally, the Rumpfs theory is used to suggest a physical
   meaning for the model parameters. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have a median age of 65-70
   years at diagnosis. Elderly patients have more chemoresistant disease,
   and this is partly due to decreased frequencies of favorable and
   increased frequencies of adverse genetic abnormalities. However,
   aging-dependent differences may also contribute. We therefore compared
   AML cell proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiles for (i) elderly
   low-risk and younger low-risk patients with favorable genetic
   abnormalities; and (ii) high-risk patients with adverse genetic
   abnormalities and a higher median age against all low-risk patients with
   lower median age. Elderly low-risk and younger low-risk patients showed
   mainly phosphoproteomic differences especially involving transcriptional
   regulators and cytoskeleton. When comparing high-risk and low-risk
   patients both proteomic and phosphoproteomic studies showed differences
   involving cytoskeleton and immunoregulation but also transcriptional
   regulation and cell division. The age-associated prognostic impact of
   cyclin-dependent kinases was dependent on the cellular context. The
   protein level of the adverse prognostic biomarker mitochondria! aldehyde
   dehydrogenase (ALDH2) showed a similar significant upregulation both in
   elderly low-risk and elderly high-risk patients. Our results suggest
   that molecular mechanisms associated with cellular aging influence
   chemoresistance of AML cells, and especially the cytoskeleton function
   may then influence cellular hallmarks of aging, e.g. mitosis, polarity,
   intracellular transport and adhesion.}},

Abstract = {{Given the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and the huge negative
   impacts it is causing, researching on COVID-19-related issues is very
   important for designing proactive and comprehensive public health

   epidemic in Vietnam. Data used in this paper were mainly obtained from
   the official database of the Ministry of Health of Vietnam. Descriptive
   statistics were carried out using Stata 16 software. As of 18 May 2020,
   the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases detected in Vietnam was 324, 16
   cases from 4 cities and provinces in the first phase (during 20 days,
   0.8 cases detected per day) and 308 cases from 35 cities, provinces in
   the second phase (during 76 days, 4.1 cases detected per day). Vietnam
   has mobilized its entire political system to fight the COVID-19 and
   achieved some initial successes. We found both similarities and
   differences between the two phases of the COVID-19 epidemic in Vietnam.
   We demonstrated that the situation of the COVID-19 epidemic in Vietnam
   is getting more complicated and unpredictable.}},

Title = {{Predicting self-harm within six months after initial presentation to
   youth mental health services: A machine learning study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 31}},
Abstract = {{Background
   A priority for health services is to reduce self-harm in young people.
   Predicting self-harm is challenging due to their rarity and complexity,
   however this does not preclude the utility of prediction models to
   improve decision-making regarding a service response in terms of more
   detailed assessments and/or intervention. The aim of this study was to
   predict self-harm within six-months after initial presentation.
   Method
   The study included 1962 young people (12-30 years) presenting to youth
   mental health services in Australia. Six machine learning algorithms
   were trained and tested with ten repeats of ten-fold cross-validation.
   The net benefit of these models were evaluated using decision curve
   analysis.
   Results
   Out of 1962 young people, 320 (16\%) engaged in self-harm in the six
   months after first assessment and 1642 (84\%) did not. The top 25\% of
   young people as ranked by mean predicted probability accounted for
   51.6\% - 56.2\% of all who engaged in self-harm. By the top 50\%, this
   increased to 82.1\%-84.4\%. Models demonstrated fair overall prediction
   (AUROCs; 0.744-0.755) and calibration which indicates that predicted
   probabilities were close to the true probabilities (brier scores;
   0.185-0.196). The net benefit of these models were positive and superior
   to the `treat everyone' strategy. The strongest predictors were (in
   ranked order); a history of self-harm, age, social and occupational
   functioning, sex, bipolar disorder, psychosis-like experiences,
   treatment with antipsychotics, and a history of suicide ideation.
   Conclusion
   Prediction models for self-harm may have utility to identify a large sub
   population who would benefit from further assessment and targeted (low
   intensity) interventions. Such models could enhance health service
   approaches to identify and reduce self-harm, a considerable source of
   distress, morbidity, ongoing health care utilisation and mortality.}},

   Evaluation of middle ear function by tympanometry and the influence of

   00:000-000, 2020.
   Objective: To evaluate middle ear function in residents of high-altitude
   areas in comparison to sea-level participants.
   Design: Prospective observational study.
   Setting: All experiments were performed by experienced audiologists with
   a calibrated tympanometry machine.
   Participants: Young adults between the age of 17 and 23 were recruited.
   Seventy-five participants from Shanghai (altitude 4 m) and 133
   participants from the Shigatse area (altitude 4,040 m) were recruited.
   Any participant with any otological disorder was excluded.
   Main Outcome Measure: Four indexes of the tympanogram were evaluated in
   the two groups from different altitudes.
   Results: Our results showed that the peak of static compliance for the
   participants in Shigatse was smaller, but the absolute compliance of
   tympanic membrane remained the same. Similarly, the ear canal volume
   (ECV) from tympanometry was also affected by the elevated altitude in
   Tibet. In addition, the tympanometric peak pressure was decreased in
   high-altitude residents, which suggests a slightly declined function of
   the Eustachian tube at lower barometric pressure. However, no difference
   was found in the tympanometric width (TW).
   Conclusion: Our results indicate that tympanograms were affected by
   decreased atmospheric pressure at high altitude. Therefore, other than
   pressure-related indexes, TW is better for evaluating the function of
   the middle ear in high-altitude regions.}},

Abstract = {{Chloroplast stromal factors involved in regulating thylakoid protein
   targeting are poorly understood. We previously reported that in
   Arabidopsis thaliana, the stromal-localized chaperone HSP90C (plastid
   heat shock protein 90) interacted with the nuclear-encoded thylakoid
   lumen protein PsbO1 (PSII subunit O isoform 1) and suggested a role for
   HSP90C in aiding PsbO1 thylakoid targeting. Using in organello transport
   assays, particularly with model substrates naturally expressed in
   stroma, we showed that light, exogenous ATP, and HSP90C activity were
   required for Secdependent transport of green fluorescent protein (GFP)
   led by the PsbO1 thylakoid targeting sequence. Using a previously
   identified PsbO1T200A mutant, we provided evidence that a stronger
   interaction between HSP90C and PsbO1 better facilitated its
   stroma-thylakoid trafficking. We also demonstrated that SecY1, the
   channel protein of the thylakoid SEC translocase, specifically
   interacted with HSP90C in vivo. Inhibition of the chaperone ATPase
   activity suppressed the association of the PsbO1GFP-HSP90C complex with
   SecY1. Together with analyzing the expression and accumulation of a few
   other thylakoid proteins that utilize the SRP, TAT, or SEC translocation
   pathways, we propose a model in which HSP90C forms a guiding complex
   that interacts with thylakoid protein precursors and assists in their
   specific targeting to the thylakoid SEC translocon.}},

Abstract = {{This study contrasts adult and child perspectives on divorce and
   separation. Based on harmonized retrospective life history data from
   eight European countries, we study the risk of divorce and separation
   from the perspective of adult unions and the perspective of children
   born into these unions. The analysis connects adult and child
   perspectives, focusing on union cohort changes (1945 to 2005) in the
   associations between parenthood, education, and (parental) separation.
   Our findings show that trends differ substantially between adult and
   child perspectives. First, the cohort surge in divorce and separation is
   stronger in adults than in children. Second, inequality in the risk of
   divorce and separation grows faster in children than in adults. For both
   trends, disparities between adult and child perspectives grow across
   cohorts due to increasingly negative associations between parenthood,
   education, and separation. In several countries, the separation surge
   has been trivial for children of higher-educated couples.}},

Title = {{Use of high strength technical textiles in strengthening of reinforced
   concrete structural elements}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE TEXTILE INSTITUTE}},
Abstract = {{A structure may show sign of deterioration earlier than its design life
   due to poor designing, change in the occupancy of the structure and the
   damage caused by abnormal and accidental loading. In order to avoid
   economic loss, the structural elements i.e. beams, slabs, columns are
   usually retrofitted and/or strengthened such that they can withstand the
   applied load during their operational life. Among many strengthening
   techniques used, use of high strength technical textiles, more commonly
   referred as fiber reinforced polymers (Carbon, Glass, Aramid, Kevlar,
   etc.) have proved to be beneficial in improving the overall performance
   of the ageing and damaged structural elements. Therefore, in this
   investigation, aim was to study the behaviour of the reinforced concrete
   beams and columns externally wrapped with carbon fiber reinforced
   polymers (CFRP) fabrics under static loading. For this purpose,
   different types of wrapping techniques were adopted to strengthen
   reinforced concrete (RC) columns and beams with CFRP wraps. The uniaxial
   compression tests were carried out on the columns investigated, whereas,
   four-point loading setup was used for the RC beams. Based on the
   detailed investigation, it was observed that the use of CFRP wraps
   proved to be significantly beneficial in improving the overall
   performance of beams and columns, as load carrying capacity, ductility
   and stiffness exhibited by CFRP wrapped specimens were found to be
   higher when compared with identical specimens without CFRP wraps.}},

Abstract = {{WNT11 is a member of the non-canonical Wnt family and plays a crucial
   role in tumor progression. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying
   WNT11 expression are unclear. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) is
   a major inflammatory cytokine produced in the tumor microenvironment and
   contributes to processes associated with tumor progression, such as
   tumor invasion and metastasis. By using site-directed mutagenesis and
   introducing a serial deletion in the 5'-regulatory region of WNT11, we
   observed that TNF alpha activates the early growth response 1
   (EGR1)-binding sequence (EBS) in the proximal region of WNT11 and that
   the transcription factor EGR1 is necessary for the TNF alpha-induced
   transcription of WNT11. EGR1 bound directly to the EBSs within the
   proximal 5'-regulatory region of WNT11 and ectopic expression of EGR1
   stimulated WNT11 promoter activity, whereas the knockdown of EGR1
   expression by RNA interference reduced TNF alpha-induced WNT11
   expression in T47D breast cancer cells. We also observed that
   mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated
   kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 kinase mediated TNF
   alpha-induced transcription of WNT11 via EGR1. Our results suggest that
   EGR1 directly targets WNT11 in response to TNF alpha stimulation in
   breast cancer cells.}},

Abstract = {{Although reading fluency instruction has been identified as an important
   literacy focus for English proficient students, little research has
   examined its role in foreign language settings, and it has not been
   studied in Chinese immersion education. The current research compared
   two seventh grade Chinese immersion classes. One class did repeated
   timed readings in student pairs, while the other class spent more time
   on comprehension activities. Both groups increased their correct Chinese
   characters per minute rates over the treatment period, but the repeated
   readings group outperformed the other group on reading fluency,
   character recognition, and reading comprehension measures. In addition,
   the students who engaged in repeated readings were better able to
   generalize reading fluency gains to new, but related, reading materials;
   they also reported more confidence and enjoyment when reading Chinese.
   Suggestions for integrating peer reading fluency procedures into
   language arts instruction are proposed.}},

Journal = {{NUTRITION AND CANCER-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL}},
Abstract = {{Liver cancer is the most common cause of mortality in men and women. The
   aim of this study was to evaluate the methanolic extract of aerial parts
   of Leonurus sibiricus L (LS) for its anticancer activity on HCC cell
   lines. Human HCC cell lines, Huh-7 and HSC-T6 were used for cytotoxicity
   assay, determination of ROS and gene expression analysis (p53, Bcl-2,
   Bax, caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9). Western blotting was used to
   assess ERK, AKT, and Caspase-3 activation. HPLC-MS analysis was also
   performed to determine the phytochemicals present in LS-M extract. LS-M
   extract has increased the expression of proapoptotic genes, including
   p53, Bax, and caspase-9 and down-regulated the activation of ERK and
   Akt. The caspase-3 activity as well as the ROS generation were
   significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner compared to control.
   The carotenoids, lutein and beta carotene present in LS-M extract
   exhibited anticancer activity. In overall, the methanolic extract of LS
   induces apoptosis in Huh-7 as well as in HSC-T6 cells possibly involving
   a ROS-mediated mitochondrial signaling pathway.

Title = {{Social Value Creation in Institutional Voids: A Business Model
   Perspective}},
Journal = {{BUSINESS \& SOCIETY}},
Abstract = {{The literature on Base of the Pyramid (BoP) strategies emphasizes that
   creating social value requires collaborative, multi-stakeholder business
   approaches. However, there is limited understanding of how businesses
   can successfully coordinate such value creation processes in the
   developing economies that face significant institutional voids. This
   study adopts a business model perspective for analyzing social value
   creation processes that span organizational boundaries. We introduce a
   novel, theoretically grounded business model framework that helps
   conceptualize social value by locating the various loci of value
   creation, and the stakeholders that partake in creating and capturing
   this value. We subsequently analyze the mechanisms of social value
   creation in M-Pesa, a renowned boundary-spanning mobile money system
   that has advanced financial inclusion among tens of millions of users in
   Kenya. The results show that information and communications technology
   can help advance social value creation by reducing the cost of
   coordinating boundary-spanning business models that integrate diverse
   societal stakeholders. The results further point to uneven
   distributional outcomes in self-governing social value creation
   strategies where the focal firm plays a coordinating role.}},

Title = {{Approach to determine the entropy coefficient of a battery by numerical
   optimization}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{480}},
Month = {{DEC 31}},
Abstract = {{Until now, the entropy coefficient of a battery has usually been
   determined experimentally using time-consuming potentiometric or
   calorimetric measuring methods. This paper aims to present an approach
   for the experimental determination of the entropy coefficient with
   numerical optimization using a thermal 0-dimensional simulation. The
   method was developed and validated by simulations of a typical battery
   module. A thermally validated simulation model of a real battery served
   as the basis for the simulations performed. The simulation results
   confirm that it is possible to determine the entropy coefficient of a
   battery module by numerical optimization. Results in different test
   scenarios (dynamic load cycles: Artemis cycle, US06 cycle) show a
   maximum absolute temperature difference of 0.1 K when comparing the
   results of a thermal higher-dimensional simulation (in this paper, a
   quasi-2-dimensional simulation is used) with the results of the thermal
   0-dimensional simulation. The new method can be implemented on a real
   battery system on a test bench. Previous time-consuming measurement
   procedures can thus be shortened.}},

Journal = {{MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS B}},

Month = {{DEC 31}},
Abstract = {{As an environmental vegetable insulation oil, camellia oil will be
   decomposed into dissolvable gases in the presence of electric field. In
   this work, the characteristic gases of camellia oil were measured by
   experiments with partial discharge and breakdown discharge, and the
   decomposition process of triglyceride, which is the main component of
   camellia oil, was investigated using molecular simulations (MSs). The
   experimental results demonstrate that H-2 is the main characteristic gas
   caused by the partial discharge while C2H2 is the main decomposition
   products for the breakdown discharge. According to the MS results, the
   C-O bond connected to the center carbon in glycerol breaks initially
   when the electric field strength is lower, and the C-(O-C) bond in the
   triglyceride molecule breaks while the electric field strength exceeded
   critical value with increase of voltage. The decomposition gas generates
   gradually through decomposition and recombination of radicals, H-2 and
   CH4 are the main gas products generated by triglyceride with low
   electric field strength, while the C2H2 increases gradually and becomes
   the main gas product with the energy of the system accumulated.}},

Abstract = {{The Asian paleotropical flora is characterized by abundance of endemic
   species, high biodiversity, and complex geological and climatic
   histories. However, the main driving mechanism underlying such high
   tropical biodiversity remains unclear. Hence, the present study aimed to
   investigate the biogeographic origin of the Asian paleotropical flora by
   tracking the speciation and diversification history of a typical
   tropical perennial, Typhonium sensu stricto (s.s.) (Araceae), using a
   time-calibrated whole-plastome phylogeny. In particular, we tested
   whether the Asian paleotropic region is a macroevolutionary source or
   sink. We observed that Typhonium s.s. originated in Indochina during the
   early-middle Miocene epoch, ca. 17.24 Ma (95\% highest posterior density
   {[}HPD]: 12.83-21.99 Ma). Most of the in situ diversification within the
   genus Typhonium s.s. has been underway since 14.73 Ma, with an
   accelerated lineage diversification at ca. 15-17 Ma, which may have been
   triggered by the intensification of the Asian monsoon system around the
   middle Miocene. Furthermore, the underground tuberous stem of Typhonium
   s.s. might have played an essential role in the adaptation to the
   seasonality caused by the monsoon in Indochina. Our results also
   suggested that peripatric speciation may be important in the
   diversification of T. trilobatum and T. roxburghii. This study provides
   a framework for studies in biogeography and evolution of the Asian
   paleotropical flora.}},

Abstract = {{Air pollution is one of the primary concerns of our society for its
   effect on human health and the environment. Among the policy measures
   that can be put in place to limit air pollutant emissions, end-of-pipe
   technologies and/or regulatory instruments may be implemented through
   legislative acts. Also, equally important are behavioural measures,
   requiring citizens' active involvement. The success of any measure to
   limit pollutant emissions requires the acceptance by the citizens that,
   in turn, implies a correct perception of the main pollutant emission
   drivers. We present here the comparison between the public perception of
   air pollution sources and the real-world situation through a survey
   carried out in seven European countries and involving 16 101
   respondents. Our study shows a dramatic underestimation of the
   contribution of the agri-food sector to air pollution. This result is
   common to all respondents in the seven countries examined and only to a
   small extent depends on gender, age and socio-economic status of the

Abstract = {{Driving is an everyday task involving a complex interaction between

   behavior during a highly demanding task in a driving simulator. A total
   of 21 emmetropic participants (21 to 34 years old) performed dual-task
   driving in which they were asked to maintain a constant speed on a
   highway while completing a visual search and detection task on a
   navigation device. Participants did the experiment with optimal vision
   and with contact lenses that introduced a visual perturbation (myopic
   defocus). The results indicate modifications of eye-head coordination
   and the dynamics of visual scanning in response to the visual
   perturbation induced. More specifically, the head was more involved in
   horizontal gaze shifts when the visual needs were not met. Furthermore,
   the evaluation of visual scanning dynamics, based on time-based entropy
   which measures the complexity and randomness of scanpaths, revealed that
   eye and gaze movements became less explorative and more stereotyped when
   vision was not optimal. These results provide evidence for a
   reorganization of both eye and head movements in response to increasing
   visual-cognitive demands during a driving task. Altogether, these
   findings suggest that eye and head movements can provide relevant
   information about visuo-cognitive demands associated with complex tasks.
   Ultimately, eye-head coordination and visual scanning dynamics may be
   good candidates to estimate drivers' workload and better characterize
   risky driving behavior.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we conducted molecular detection and characterization of
   piroplasms that infect the Ethiopian or desert hedgehogs (Paraechinus
   aethiopicus) in Saudi Arabia. Blood samples from 112 (68 males and 44
   females) desert hedgehogs from Unaizah, Central Saudi Arabia were
   screened for Theileria/Babesia DNA using the polymerase chain reaction
   (PCR) employing specific primers amplifying the partial 18S small
   subunit rRNA gene. Theileria DNA was detected in 51 samples (45 center
   dot 5\%), giving a prevalence of 45 center dot 5\%. Theileria DNA was
   found in 33 (48 center dot 5\%) males and 18 (40 center dot 9\%)
   females, and there was no significant difference (P > 0 center dot 05)
   in the prevalence between males and females. Similarly, there was no
   significant difference (P > 0 center dot 05) in the prevalence between
   juveniles (40\%) and adults (46 center dot 7\%). There was a significant
   difference in the prevalence of Theileria in hedgehogs collected from
   May to September and the period from October to April (P = 0 center dot
   003). Four haplotypes of Theileria sp. in hedgehogs were detected and
   designated as H1-H4. H1 was the predominant haplotype and found in 80
   center dot 8\% of the positive individuals. Partial sequences of the 18S
   rRNA of Theileria sp. from hedgehogs grouped with Theileria spp. that
   are benign. This study is the first report of the occurrence of
   Theileria spp. in Saudi Arabian desert hedgehogs.}},

Title = {{A list of land plants of Parque Nacional do Caparao, Brazil, highlights
   the presence of sampling gaps within this protected area}},
Journal = {{BIODIVERSITY DATA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Brazilian protected areas are essential for plant conservation in the
   Atlantic Forest domain, one of the 36 global biodiversity hotspots. A
   major challenge for improving conservation actions is to know the plant
   richness, protected by these areas. Online databases offer an accessible
   way to build plant species lists and to provide relevant information
   about biodiversity. A list of land plants of ``Parque Nacional do
   Caparao{''} (PNC) was previously built using online databases and
   published on the website ``Catalogo de Plantas das Unidades de
   Conservacao do Brasil.{''} Here, we provide and discuss additional
   information about plant species richness, endemism and conservation in
   the PNC that could not be included in the List. We documented 1,791
   species of land plants as occurring in PNC, of which 63 are cited as
   threatened (CR, EN or VU) by the Brazilian National Red List, seven as
   data deficient (DD) and five as priorities for conservation. Fifity-one
   species were possible new ocurrences for ES and MG states.
   New information
   ``Parque Nacional do Caparao{''} houses 8\% of the land plant species
   endemic to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, including 6\% of its
   angiosperms, 31\% of its lycophytes and ferns and 14\% of its avascular
   plants. Twelve percent of the threatened species listed for the State of
   Espirito Santo and 7\% listed for the State of Minas Gerais are also
   protected by PNC. Surprisingly, 79\% of the collections analysed here
   were carried out in Minas Gerais, which represents just 21\% of the
   total extension of the Park. The compiled data uncover a huge botanical
   collection gap in this federally-protected area.}},

Abstract = {{Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) patients often suffer from both muscle
   wasting and osteoporosis. Our previous studies have revealed reduced
   regeneration potential in skeletal muscle and bone, concomitant with
   ectopic calcification of soft tissues in double knockout (dKO,
   dystrophin-/-; utrophin-/-) mice, a severe murine model for DMD. We
   found significant involvement of RhoA/ROCK (Rho-Associated Protein
   Kinase) signaling in mediating ectopic calcification of muscles in dKO
   mice. However, the cellular identity of these RhoA+ cells, and the role
   that RhoA plays in the chronic inflammation-associated pathologies has
   not been elucidated. Here, we report that CD68+ macrophages are highly
   prevalent at the sites of ectopic calcification of dKO mice, and that
   these macrophages highly express RhoA. Macrophages from dKO mice feature
   a shift towards a more proinflammatory M1 polarization and an increased
   expression of various senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)
   factors that was reduced with the RhoA/ROCK inhibitor Y-27632. Further,
   systemic inhibition of RhoA activity in dKO mice led to reduced number
   of RhoA+/CD68+ cells, as well as a reduction in fibrosis and ectopic
   calcification. Together, these data revealed that RhoA signaling may be
   a key regulator of imbalanced mineralization in the dystrophic
   musculoskeletal system and consequently a therapeutic target for the
   treatment of DMD or other related muscle dystrophies.}},

Title = {{Short and long interpregnancy interval and the risk for pediatric

Journal = {{PEDIATRIC PULMONOLOGY}},
Year = {{2021}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Introduction Interpregnancy interval (IPI) is defined as the period
   between a live birth and the conception of a subsequent fetus. Both
   short (IPI < 6 months) and long IPI (IPI > 60 months) have been shown to
   increase the risk for adverse perinatal outcomes, some of which, are
   known risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in the
   offspring.
   Aims To study the association between IPI and risk for offspring OSAS,
   during a follow-up period of up to 18 years.
   Study design Population-based cohort.
   Subjects In this population-based cohort analysis, all singleton live
   births, born to a mother with at least one previous birth occurring
   between 1991 and 2014, were included. Congenital malformations were
   excluded.
   Materials and Methods Hospitalizations of the offspring due to OSAS
   diagnosis up to 18 years of age, were evaluated according to IPI length.
   Intermediate IPI (6-60 months) was considered as the reference. A
   Kaplan-Meier survival curve and a Cox hazards regression model were used
   to compare the incidence of OSAS between the groups, and to adjust for
   confounding variables.
   Results The study population included 144,397 deliveries, of which
   13.1\% (n = 18,947) were followed by short IPI, 7.9\% (n = 11,438) and
   79.0\% (n = 114,012) were followed by long and intermediate IPI,
   respectively. OSAS hospitalization rates were significantly higher among
   the long IPI group compared to intermediate and short IPIs (0.9\%; 0.7\%
   and 0.6\%, respectively, p = .001). The association between long IPI and
   offspring pediatric OSAS remained significant after controlling for
   preterm delivery, maternal diabetes, and smoking, and mode of delivery,
   (adjusted HR = 1.45; 95\% CI, 1.17-1.80).
   Conclusions Children born following long IPI are at increased risk for
   pediatric OSAS.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{125}},
Number = {{26}},
Month = {{DEC 31}},
Abstract = {{Charge density waves (CDWs) are understood in great detail in one
   dimension, but they remain largely enigmatic in two-dimensional systems.
   In particular, numerous aspects of the associated energy gap and the
   formation mechanism are not fully understood. Two long-standing riddles
   are the amplitude and position of the CDW gap with respect to the Fermi
   level (E-F) and the frequent absence of CDW contrast inversion (CI)
   between opposite bias scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images. Here,
   we find compelling evidence that these two issues are intimately
   related. Combining density functional theory and STM to analyze the CDW
   pattern and modulation amplitude in 1T-TiSe2, we find that CI takes
   place at an unexpected negative sample bias because the CDW gap opens
   away from E-F, deep inside the valence band. This bias becomes
   increasingly negative as the CDW gap shifts to higher binding energy
   with electron doping. This study shows the importance of CI in STM
   images to identify periodic modulations with a CDW and to gain valuable
   insight into the CDW gap, whose measurement is notoriously
   controversial.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EATING DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{646-651}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Due to high prevalence, female athletes are considered a
   high-risk group for eating disorders (i.e., clinical ED = 2.0\% to
   19.9\%; subclinical ED = 7.1\% to 49.2\%). Cross-sectional and
   longitudinal research have identified psychosocial factors that
   influence current and future disordered eating (e.g., appearance
   pressures, body satisfaction), but are limited in design (e.g.,
   timeframe, active competitors). Quantitative evaluations of psychosocial
   predictors of female athletes' disordered eating in retirement are
   lacking.
   Method: The current study investigated the predictive ability of
   psychosocial risk factors (e.g., body dissatisfaction, negative affect)
   from Time1, when collegiate female athletes were actively competing, to
   Time2, 6 years later when the women were retired (N = 194; M-age = 25.75
   years {[}SD = 1.19]).
   Results: From Time1 to Time2, 23.5\% of the women who were Healthy moved
   to the Disordered classification; 51\% remained in Disordered. The full
   model for athletes who maintained their Disordered status correctly
   classified 76\% of the athletes. Dietary intent, pressure to exercise
   and change appearance, body satisfaction, and internalization
   significantly predicted athletes' maintenance as Disordered.
   Discussion: Early intervention efforts that address appearance
   pressures, body image, and healthful eating when athletes are actively
   competing are vital to help alleviate future distress, particularly in
   retirement.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{We examined clinical stage distribution and proportion of
   screen-detected cases of stomach, colorectal, lung, female breast and
   cervical cancer by sex and age group using Osaka Cancer Registry data
   from 2000-2014. The proportion of local or in situ stage cancer had
   increased for all age groups in all sites, except stomach cancer in the
   0-49 years group and female breast cancer in the 80 years and older
   group. The proportion of screen-detected cases had increased during the
   study period for all age groups in all cancer sites. While the
   proportion increased noticeably in the younger groups, there was only a
   slight increase in the older groups. Regarding stomach, colorectal and
   lung cancers, the proportion of local and in situ stage had similarly
   increased in the 65-79 years and 80 years and older age groups compared
   with younger groups, despite lower exposure to cancer screening.
   Regarding breast and cervical cancers, the increases in local and in
   situ cancer paralleled the increase in screen-detected cases. These
   findings suggest that the increases in early stage stomach, colorectal
   and lung cancers might be due not only to the expansion of screening
   programs but also the development of clinical diagnostic imaging or
   other reasons. The increases in local and in situ stage breast and
   cervical cancers seemed to be due to the expansion of screening.
   Continued monitoring of trends in cancer incidence by clinical stage may
   be helpful for estimating the effectiveness of screening.}},

Abstract = {{To clarify the effects of anion species and solvents on the Coulombic
   efficiency and polarization of magnesium deposition/dissolution
   reactions, the anode/electrolyte interfacial behavior of magnesium
   tetrakis(hexafluoroisopropyloxy) borate (Mg{[}B(HFIP)(4)](2)) and
   magnesium bis(trifluoromethanesulfony)amide (Mg(TFSA) 2 ) was
   investigated and compared in triglyme and 2-methlytetrahydrofuran
   (2-MeTHF). When using triglyme, which has strong interaction with
   magnesium ions, decomposition of {[}B(HFIP)(4)](-) in
   Mg{[}B(HFIP)(4)](2)/triglyme was hard to occur because of the high
   reduction stability of the uncoordinated {[}B(HFIP)(4)](-) anion,
   resulting in significantly higher Coulombic efficiency and smaller
   polarization than Mg(TFSA)(2)/triglyme. When 2-MeTHF was used as the
   solvent, magnesium deposition/dissolution reactions occurred in the
   Mg{[}B(HFIP)(4)](2)/2-MeTHF electrolyte but not in the
   Mg{[}TFSA](2)/2-MeTHF electrolyte. This is because the coordinated
   {[}B(HFIP)(4)](-) anion in Mg{[}B(HFIP)(4)](2) /2-MeTHF is stable at the
   magnesium deposition potential. However, the reductive stability of the
   coordinated {[}B(HFIP)(4)](-) anion is inferior to that of the
   uncoordinated {[}B(HFIP)(4)](-) anion, resulting in the
   Mg{[}B(HFIP)(4)](2)/2-MeTHF Coulombic efficiency being lower than that
   of Mg{[}B(HFIP)(4)](2)/triglyme. Our results indicate that solvents that
   could not be used with Mg(TFSA) 2 are suitable in weakly coordinating
   anion electrolytes, such as Mg{[}B(HFIP)(4)](2). Controlling the
   interaction between magnesium ions and anions by selecting suitable
   anions and solvents is essential for designing new electrolytes for
   magnesium rechargeable batteries.}},

Abstract = {{Cancer cells utilize extensive autophagy in effort to adapt to high
   metabolic stress. This indicates that impairing the high autophagic flux
   might be an attractive target for cancer therapy. Autophagy related gene
   4A (ATG4A) is a key player for autophagy and its inhibition may help in
   tumor clearance. The present study aims to screen candidate drugs from
   FDA-approved drugs, a subset of Zinc database, to identify potential
   ATG4A inhibitors that may have anti-cancer activity. Computer aided drug
   design approach was applied for the study using the virtual screening
   tools Raccoon and MGLTools-1.5.6. We have identified the drug Lumacaftor
   as a potent inhibitor of ATG4A on the basis of computational approaches
   viz. molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation and MM/PBSA
   method. The drug is likely to be a potent regimen candidate to be used
   as an anti-cancer molecule. However, this potent inhibitor against ATG4A
   as anti-cancer molecule needs further investigation and validation.}},

Abstract = {{Synchronizing movements with an external periodic stimulus, such as
   tapping your foot along with a metronome, is a remarkable human skill
   called sensorimotor synchronization. A growing body of literature
   investigates this process, but experiments require collecting responses
   with high temporal reliability, which often requires specialized
   hardware. The current article presents and validates TeensyTap, an
   inexpensive, highly functional framework with excellent timing
   performance. The framework uses widely available, low-cost hardware and
   consists of custom-written open-source software and communication
   protocols. TeensyTap allows running complete experiments through a
   graphical user interface and can simultaneously present a pacing signal
   (metronome), measure movements using a force-sensitive resistor, and
   deliver auditory feedback, with optional experimenter-specified
   artificial feedback delays. Movement data is communicated to a computer
   and saved for offline analysis in a format that allows it to be easily
   imported into spreadsheet programs. The present work also reports a
   validation experiment showing that timing performance of TeensyTap is
   highly accurate, ranking it among the gold standard tools available in
   the field. Metronome pacing signals are presented with millisecond
   accuracy, feedback sounds are delivered on average 2 ms following the
   subjects'taps, and the timing log files produced by the device are
   unbiased and accurate to within a few milliseconds. The framework allows
   for a range of experimental questions to be addressed and, since it is
   open source and transparent, researchers with some technical expertise
   can easily adapt and extend it to accommodate a host of possible future
   experiments that have yet to be imagined.}},

Volume = {{32}},

Abstract = {{The cytological features of granular cell tumour (GCT) are generally
   quite typical but, in some cases, the fine needle aspiration cytology
   (FNAC) diagnosis of GCT may be difficult or impossible because of
   unusual sites of onset or equivocal cytological features. In this
   report, two GCTs with atypical FNAC features are described in order to
   investigate the causes and provide possible diagnostic tips. From a
   series of nine histologically proven GCTs, two inconclusive FNAC cases
   were retrieved. Smears were poorly cellular showing isolated naked
   nuclei, anisonucleosis, granular chromatin and occasional small
   nucleoli. The background was finely granular in one case. Histological
   controls of these cases revealed marked fibrosis. Tumour-associated
   fibrosis in GCT is variable and does not seem to influence clinical
   behaviour but it influences the harvest and the integrity of granular
   cells collected by FNAC. When GCT smears are poorly cellular, attention
   should be paid to the granular background and to the few granular cells,
   if any, as they might be the only features to suggest a GCT.}},

Title = {{Targeted disruption of the histone lysine 79 methyltransferase Dot1L in
   nephron progenitors causes congenital renal dysplasia}},
Journal = {{EPIGENETICS}},
Abstract = {{The epigenetic regulator Dot1, the only known histone H3K79
   methyltransferase, has a conserved role in organismal development and
   homoeostasis. In yeast, Dot1 is required for telomeric silencing and
   genomic integrity. In Drosophila, Dot1 (Grappa) regulates homoeotic gene
   expression. Dysregulation of DOT1L (human homologue of Dot1) causes
   leukaemia and is implicated in dilated cardiomyopathy. In mice, germline
   disruption of Dot1L and loss of H3K79me2 disrupt vascular and
   haematopoietic development. Targeted inactivation of Dot1L in principal
   cells of the mature collecting duct affects terminal differentiation and
   cell type patterning. However, the role of H3K79 methylation in
   mammalian tissue development has been questioned, as it is dispensable
   in the intestinal epithelium, a rapidly proliferating tissue. Here, we
   used lineage-specific Cre recombinase to delineate the role of Dot1L
   methyltransferase activity in the mouse metanephric kidney, an organ
   that develops via interactions between ureteric epithelial (Hoxb7) and
   mesenchymal (Six2) cell lineages. The results demonstrate that
   Dot1L(Hoxb7) is dispensable for ureteric bud branching morphogenesis. In
   contrast, Dot1L(Six2) is critical for the maintenance and
   differentiation of Six2+ progenitors into epithelial nephrons. Dot1LSix2
   mutant kidneys exhibit congenital nephron deficit and cystic dysplastic
   kidney disease. Molecular analysis implicates defects in key renal
   developmental regulators, such as Lhx1, Pax2 and Notch. We conclude that
   the developmental functions of Dot1L-H3K79 methylation in the kidney are
   lineage-restricted. The link between H3K79me and renal developmental
   pathways reaffirms the importance of chromatin-based mechanisms in
   organogenesis.}},

Title = {{A model to rate strategies for managing disease due to COVID-19
   infection}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 31}},
Abstract = {{Considering looming fatality and economic recession, effective policy
   making based on ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is an urgent and standing
   issue. Numerous issues for controlling infection have arisen from public
   discussion led by medical professionals. Yet understanding of these
   factors has been necessarily qualitative and control measures to correct
   unfavorable trends specific to an infection area have been lacking. The
   logical implement for control is a large scale stochastic model with
   countless parameters lacking robustness and requiring enormous data.
   This paper presents a remedy for this vexing problem by proposing an
   alternative approach. Machine learning has come to play a widely
   circulated role in the study of complex data in recent times. We
   demonstrate that when machine learning is employed together with the
   mechanistic framework of a mathematical model, there can be a
   considerably enhanced understanding of complex systems. A mathematical
   model describing the viral infection dynamics reveals two
   transmissibility parameters influenced by the management strategies in
   the area for the control of the current pandemic. Both parameters
   readily yield the peak infection rate and means for flattening the
   curve, which is correlated to different management strategies by
   employing machine learning, enabling comparison of different strategies
   and suggesting timely alterations. Treatment of population data with the
   model shows that restricted non-essential business closure, school
   closing and strictures on mass gathering influence the spread of
   infection. While a rational strategy for initiation of an economic
   reboot would call for a wider perspective of the local economics, the
   model can speculate on its timing based on the status of the infection
   as reflected by its potential for an unacceptably renewed viral
   onslaught.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic, momentary affective states have significant effects on
   creativity; however, how negative affect modulates the neurocognitive
   processes involved in creativity is still unclear. This study
   investigated the neural mechanisms of creative thinking under varying
   avoidance-motivation intensity. Sixty participants (17 men and 43 women;
   age range = 18-25 years; mean = 21.22 years, SD = 1.35) randomly
   assigned to three groups (high-avoidance-motivation,
   low-avoidance-motivation, and unmotivated bias state) completed creative
   tasks in two conditions - creative idea generation and creative idea
   evaluation. In the former condition, the low-avoidance-motivation group
   exhibited greater fluency of divergent thinking than the
   high-avoidance-motivation group. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy
   revealed an interaction effect between creative demand and
   avoidance-motivation intensity in the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus
   and right middle frontal gyrus in creative idea generation. In the
   latter condition, there were no significant differences between the
   three avoidance motivation groups in behavior and brain activation
   results. Furthermore, the association of the prefrontal cortex and

   0.28), autism symptoms (g = 0.27), and language (g = 0.29) domains. The
   effect sizes of autism symptoms and language were moderated by country
   (Western versus Asian countries). However, there were no significant
   effects observed for the social communication domain.
   Conclusion: The ESDM intervention significantly improved autism
   symptoms, language, and cognition. The effect sizes of autism symptoms
   and language were larger in Asian countries than in Western countries.}},

   oligodontia in Class-I malocclusion in late mix dentition. Case Report.
   An 11-year-old boy with ED was treated and managed by means of
   interceptive orthodontic treatment accompanied by direct and indirect
   restorative methods in a successful manner. The patient was prepared to
   receive definitive oral rehabilitation with dental implants for the
   missing teeth when the patient reaches a suitable age. The patient was
   followed for 5 years from the beginning of treatment. Conclusion.
   Management of the child with ectodermal dysplasia with oligodontia was a
   real challenge. Early diagnosis, necessary investigation, and providing
   age-appropriate multidisciplinary treatment were key steps in successful
   outcomes. The objectives were not only just orthodontic or paedodontics
   but also prosthetic and psychological.}},

   Adenocarcinoma through Immune Infiltration}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Background. RNA helicases have various essential functions in basically
   all aspects of RNA metabolism, not only unwinding RNA but also
   disturbing the interaction of RNA with proteins. Recently, RNA helicases
   have been considered potential targets in cancers. So far, there has
   been no detailed investigation of the biological functions of RNA
   helicase DHX37 in cancers. Objective. We aim to identify the prognostic
   value of DHX37 associated with tumor microenvironments in cancers.
   Methods. DHX37 expression was examined via the Oncomine database and
   Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER). We explored the prognostic
   role of DHX37 in cancers across various databases. Coexpression genes,
   Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG),
   and fundamental regulators were performed via LinkedOmics. Confirming
   the prognostic value of DHX37 in liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC)
   and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), we explored the role of DHX37 in
   infiltrated lymphocytes in cancers using the Gene Expression Profiling
   Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) and TIMER databases. Results. Through GO
   and KEGG analyses, expression of DHX37 was also correlated with complex
   function-specific networks involving the ribosome and RNA metabolic
   signaling pathways. In LIHC and LUAD, DHX37 expression showed
   significant positive correlations with markers of T-regs,
   myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and T cell exhaustion,
   contributing to immune tolerance. Conclusion. These results indicate
   that DHX37 can serve as a prognostic biomarker in LIHC and LUAD while
   having an important role in immune tolerance by activating the function
   of T-regs, MDSC, and T cell exhaustion.}},

Abstract = {{One critical issue to phosphoric acid (PA) doped high-temperature proton
   exchange membranes (HT-PEMs) is to balance the proton conductivity and
   mechanical properties for overall application performance in fuel cells.
   Addressing the issue, we prepare durable HT-PEMs having the dual
   crosslinking structure by employing poly
   (vinylimidazole-divinylbenzene-styrene) (poly(VIm-DVB-St)) copolymer as
   a crosslinker and using the poly (aromatic ether ketone) (PAEK) polymer
   containing four methyl groups as the host membrane matrix. The imidazole
   groups of poly(VIm-DVB-St) react with benzyl bromide groups of
   brominated PAEK for both the primary cross-linking network and high PA
   doping. The divinylbenzene crosslinked poly (styrene-co-vinylimidazole)
   network generates the secondary cross-linking structure. The formed
   reticular polymer chain structure brings on low swelling and high
   mechanical strength of the HT-PEMs. The fuel cell based on the acid
   doped PAEK41-85\%VIm/233.0 PA shows a H-2-air fuel cell peak power
   density of 306 mW cm(-2) at 200 degrees C without back pressure, and a
   low degradation rate of 3.9 x 10(-5) V h(-1) during a period of 600 h
   under a constant current density of 200 mA cm(-2) at 160 degrees C.}},

Title = {{In situ synthesize of ZnO nanoparticles on cotton fabric by laser
   ablation method; antibacterial activities}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE TEXTILE INSTITUTE}},
Abstract = {{In this research work, ZnO nanoparticles were produced by pulsed laser
   ablation method, employing the fundamental wavelength of pulsed Nd:YAG
   laser of 1064 nm and 7 ns pulse width in deionized water. Four sizes of
   nanoparticles were produced using different pulse numbers of laser.
   Simultaneously cotton fabric samples were placed near the Zn target in
   the ablation container. The ZnO nano particles were in situ synthesized
   on cotton samples. Characteristics of produced nanoparticles were
   examined using excitonic absorption peak and Fourier transform infrared
   (FTIR). X-ray diffraction pattern and dynamic light scattering (DLS)
   measurement were employed to determine the crystalline structure and
   size distribution of nanoparticles respectively. Morphology of
   nanoparticles were observed using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and
   Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). Reflection and transmittance
   spectra of treated cotton fabrics were measured and compared using
   spectrophotometer. Results show that transmittance of treated cotton is
   less than untreated one in UVA and UVB region. Also inductively coupled
   plasma device were used to study the amounts of nanoparticles on the
   cotton fabrics before and after 20 cycles of washing. Finally, the
   antibacterial properties of ZnO nanoparticles on Staphylococcus Aureus
   contaminated cotton fabric were tested. Results show that Staphylococcus
   bacteria may not survive on the treated textile even after 20 cycles of
   washing.}},

Abstract = {{This letter presents the original design of a microelectromechanical
   systems inertial switch with ultra-low threshold (similar to 0.6 g) and
   great potential for batch manufacturing. The gravity is utilized to
   narrow the gap between electrodes during operation, defined here as
   threshold compensation. This lightens the fabrication burden, enabling
   the device to be made by standard silicon-on-glass micromachining
   without excessive optimization. Finite element analysis has been
   conducted to demonstrate positive effects of gravity involvement (9.4 mu
   m reduction of the gap) and compliance design of the movable electrodes
   (multiplied contact time and less than half coefficient of restitution).
   Fabricated inertial switches have been installed into a vibration system
   to test fundamental characteristics. Under vibration conditions with
   amplitude of 0.6 g and frequencies from 25 to 40 Hz, the devices achieve
   reliable switching with triggering time ranging from 81.2 to 119.3 mu s.}},

   exam sleep quality and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and
   potential influence factors in the first phases of COVID-19 massive
   outbreak in China. A snowball sampling technique was used and a total of
   2027 Chinese participated in the present study. Demographic information,
   epidemic area contact history, sleep quality and PTSS data were
   collected with an internet-based cross-sectional survey. Results
   suggested that 59.7\% participants were not fully satisfied with their
   sleep quality, and 50.9\% participants had various degrees of short
   sleep duration problems. 44.1\% and 33.0\% participants had sleep
   disturbance and sleep onset latency problems. Also, the prevalence of
   PTSS reached 4.7\% in the self-rating survey. Epidemic area contact
   history affected PTSS and latency onset of sleep under the influence of
   COVID-19. Epidemic area contact history and sleep quality had
   interaction effects on PTSS. The present study was one of the first to
   evaluate acute psychological responses and possible risk factors during
   the peak of COVID-19 in China and results indicate that keeping good
   sleep quality in individuals with pandemic exposure experiences is a way
   to prevent PTSS.}},

Abstract = {{Noble metal nanoclusters supported on a transition metal oxide surface
   are always regarded as the prototypical catalysts, and the controllable
   manipulation of the metal catalysts provides an efficient way to
   deliberately control the catalytic reactions, which still remains an
   experimental challenge thus far, possibly because of their
   nanometer-scale size and complex geometry. In this study, we report an
   electrically induced controllable manipulation of the Au nanoclusters on
   the oxidized rutile TiO2(110)-(1 x 1) surface by atomic force microscopy
   at 78 K. We demonstrate that, by applying the positive and negative
   voltage pulse beside the Au nanocluster, the target Au nanocluster can
   be laterally displaced on the oxidized rutile TiO2 (110) surface. In
   addition, by applying the voltage pulse precisely on top of the Au
   nanoclusters, the reversible structural fluxionality of the Au
   nanoclusters between hemispherical and double-peak configurations is
   experimentally demonstrated for the first time, without any unexpected
   lateral/ vertical manipulation or charge state transition. We propose
   that such a kind of controllable geometric manipulation of the Au
   nanoclusters is dominantly attributed to the tip-induced local electric
   field, which can be effectively tuned by controlling the tip site,
   magnitude, and polarity of the applied voltage pulse. Our study provides
   a pioneering work about the electrically induced manipulation of the
   nanometer-scale noble metal clusters on transition metal oxides, and can
   be potentially applied to deliberately control the catalytic reactions
   based on noble metal catalysts.}},

Abstract = {{Ion-surface scattering experiments can be used to measure elemental
   depth profiles on the angstrom scale in complex liquid mixtures. We
   employ NICISS (neutral impact collision ion scattering spectroscopy) to
   measure depth profiles of dissolved ions and solvent in liquid glycerol
   containing the cationic surfactant tetrahexylammonium bromide
   (THA(+)/Br-) at 0.013 M and mixtures of NaBr + NaCl at 0.4 M total
   concentration. The experiments reveal that Br- outcompetes Cl- in its
   attraction to surface THA(+), and that THA(+) segregates more
   extensively when more Br- ions are present. Intriguingly, the depths
   spanned by THA(+), Br-, and Cl- ions generally increase with Br- bulk
   concentration, expanding from similar to 10 to similar to 25 angstrom
   for both Br- and Cl- depth profiles. This broadening likely occurs
   because of an increasing pileup of THA(+) ions in a multilayer region
   that spreads the halide ions over a wider depth. The experiments
   indicate that cationic surfactants enhance Br- and Cl- concentrations in
   the surface region far beyond their bulk-phase values, making solutions
   coated with these surfactants potentially more reactive toward gases
   that can oxidize the halide ions.}},

Title = {{Flexible Free-Standing MoO3/Ti3C2Tz MXene Composite Films with High
   Gravimetric and Volumetric Capacities}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Enhancing both the energy storage and power capabilities of
   electrochemical capacitors remains a challenge. Herein, Ti3C2Tz MXene is
   mixed with MoO3 nanobelts in various mass ratios and the mixture is used
   to vacuum filter binder free, open, flexible, and free-standing films.
   The conductive Ti3C2Tz flakes bridge the nanobelts, facilitating
   electron transfer; the randomly oriented, and interconnected, MoO3
   nanobelts, in turn, prevent the restacking of the Ti3C2Tz nanosheets.
   Benefitting from these advantages, a MoO3/Ti3C2Tz film with a 8:2 mass
   ratio exhibits high gravimetric/volumetric capacities with good
   cyclability, namely, 837 C g(-1) and 1836 C cm(-3) at 1 A g(-1) for an
   approximate to 10 mu m thick film; and 767 C g(-1) and 1664 C cm(-3) at
   1 A g(-1) for approximate to 50 mu m thick film. To further increase the
   energy density, hybrid capacitors are fabricated with MoO3/Ti3C2Tz films
   as the negative electrodes and nitrogen-doped activated carbon as the
   positive electrodes. This device delivers maximum gravimetric/volumetric
   energy densities of 31.2 Wh kg(-1) and 39.2 Wh L-1, respectively. The
   cycling stability of 94.2\% retention ratio after 10 000 continuous
   charge/discharge cycles is also noteworthy. The high energy density
   achieved in this work can pave the way for practical applications of
   MXene-containing materials in energy storage devices.}},

Title = {{Do financial constraints moderate the relationship between innovation
   subsidies and firms' R\&D investment?}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this paper is to analyse whether the effect of
   innovation subsidies on firms' R\&D investment varies depending on
   whether the firm is suffering from financial constraints.
   Design/methodology/approach To address this analysis, the authors
   provide a theoretical model and test their hypothesis using an
   econometric analysis of an unbalanced panel of 3,865 innovative Spanish
   firms during 2010-2017. They employ the SABI database to obtain firms'
   financial and economic data and incorporate firms' MORE financial
   rating. Specifically, the authors use the GMM-SYS technique to regress
   and measure the marginal effects of innovation subsidies size on firms'
   R\&D investment and the influence of firms' financial constraints.
   Findings The results of this work indicate that financial constraints
   negatively moderate the effect of subsidies on R\&D investment; that is,
   those firms that receive a subsidy and suffer financial constraints
   invest less in R\&D projects than those which also receive the subsidy
   and do not suffer financial constraints. Besides, this work found that
   innovation subsidies alone do not significantly increase firms' R\&D
   investment. Originality/value From a neoclassical point of view, the
   existence of financial constraints is the justification of public
   innovation policies. However, due to the difficulty of measuring
   financial constraints, innovation literature has abandoned the analysis
   of this crucial variable. This work reintroduces this vital variable and
   analyses how it interacts with innovation subsidies on firms' R\&D
   investment.}},

   catalysts for CO2 activation}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{534}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{The properties of single metal atoms adsorbed on MoS2 monolayer surface
   as well as the behaviour of CO2 molecules on these active sites are
   studied by using density functional theory methods. Eleven different
   transition metals (Au, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ir, Mn, Ni, Pd, Pt or Sn) were
   considered as well as the main adsorption sites on the surface. Reported
   results show adsorption on top of Mo atoms and hollow sites on the
   hexagonal ring centres leading to very large adsorption energies. The
   adsorption is characterized by deep interaction wells and adsorbed metal
   to surface charge transfer in most of the studied atoms. The low surface
   coverage upon single atom adsorption hinders in plane metal diffusion
   and thus once atoms are adsorbed, they remain on top on each site as
   showed by Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The behaviour of CO2
   molecules on top of active sites formed by metal atoms adsorbed on the
   monolayer is characterized by strong chemisorption, leading to large
   bending of gas molecules, thus showing how CO2 molecules can react on
   these metal sites. This work reports for the first time a systematic
   evaluation of transition metal atoms adsorbed on MoS2 monolayers,
   including their dynamic properties, as well as their properties as
   active sites for CO2 reactions.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To describe a case of suspected hepatotoxicity in a dog
   secondary to administration of trazodone.
   Case Summary A 6-year-old, neutered, mixed breed dog was evaluated for a
   progressive increased liver enzyme activity over a 6-week period. The
   patient originally presented for raisin toxicosis, and hence, was having
   serial blood work monitoring performed. Trazodone was initially started
   at that time due to severe separation anxiety while hospitalized
   (consistently 5 out of 7 days of the week, for a 6-week duration). Due
   to continued increased liver enzyme activity, extensive workup was
   performed which included abdominal ultrasound, leptospirosis titers,
   bile acids, and liver biopsies. Histopathologic findings were consistent
   with acute hepatotoxicity. In the absence of other toxicants and the
   close proximity to drug administration, a drug-induced hepatopathy
   secondary to trazodone was presumed. Following discontinuation of
   trazodone therapy, the hepatopathy completely resolved and the patient
   fully recovered.
   New or Unique Information Provided While acute hepatotoxicity has been
   reported in human medicine secondary to the administration of trazodone,
   this is the first reported case of suspected hepatotoxicity in a dog
   secondary to trazodone therapy. Veterinary professionals should be aware
   of the rare potential adverse effect that may be seen in canine patients
   secondary to trazodone therapy. Appropriate clinicopathologic monitoring
   should occur in patients on chronic trazodone therapy.}},

Title = {{Training and academic demands are associated with sleep quality in
   high-performance ``dual career{''} student swimmers}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SPORT SCIENCE}},
Abstract = {{Dual career collegiate athletes, who combine sporting endeavours with
   academic studies, are commonplace in high-performance sport. Sleep is an
   important aspect of physical and psychological recovery for athletes,
   plays a role in memory and learning and is associated with academic
   achievement. The aim of this study was to assess variations in sleep
   characteristics of collegiate swimmers to understand the incidence of
   poor sleep, and which stressors might contribute towards this. A total
   of 22 (male n = 13, female n = 9) high-performance student swimmers
   (mean +/- SD; age 20 +/- 2 years) participated in this study. Sleep/wake
   behaviour was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index each
   month over a 12-month period. Additionally, academic and sporting
   commitments were quantified on a monthly basis and summarised as 4
   stressors: average weekly training hours, total number of competitive
   races, total number of academic assessments, and average weekly learning
   hours. On average across the 12-month period, 41.7\% of athletes
   reported poor sleep. The latest bedtimes, wake times and longest sleep
   durations were found in the months where academic and training demands
   were lowest. A statistically significant positive association was
   identified between median sleep quality scores and mean number of
   academic assessments (rho((12)) = 0.71, p=0.005). Hierarchal linear
   modelling analysis determined that number of academic assessments best
   predicted sleep quality within this cohort. The present study highlights
   the need for those working with athletes who have competing academic
   demands to consider sleep quality, and its potential impact on
   performance and wellbeing.}},

Title = {{Responsiveness and Democratic Accountability: Observational Evidence
   from an Experiment in a Mixed-Member Proportional System}},
Journal = {{LEGISLATIVE STUDIES QUARTERLY}},
Abstract = {{Electoral systems provide distinctive accountability mechanisms in
   democratic polities and thereby affect government responsiveness to
   citizens. In this article, we concentrate on the effects of proportional
   vis-a-vis majoritarian electoral rules. We expect members of parliament
   to be more responsive under majoritarian rule, because these MPs have a
   direct mandate from their local constituency, are less dependent on
   their party, and can be held directly accountable by voters. We exploit
   Germany's mixed-member system and test MP's responsiveness using
   behavioral data generated within a two-round field experiment. The
   experiment observes concrete interactions between voters and
   representatives. In the experiment, real voters sent emails about a
   policy issue to their MPs. We show that MPs who were elected via the
   majoritarian tier are almost twice as likely to respond to a voter
   request than MPs elected via PR. Our results deliver novel evidence that
   electoral institutions cause distinct behavioral responses from elected
   officials.}},

   diazirines as practical reagents for the decarboxylative amination of
   simple and complex redox-active esters. The diaziridines thus produced
   are readily diversifiable to amines, hydrazines, and nitrogen-containing
   heterocycles in one step. The reaction has also been applied in fluorous

Title = {{A study of the mechanical properties and appearance of efflorescence in
   paving bricks under different curing environments}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{265}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{Taiwan has witnessed rapid economic development in recent years, and
   with urban development, the planning and design of compressed paving
   units and pervious ground tile structures are focused on the demand for
   esthetic appearance in addition to practical functioning and legal
   requirements for strength and water permeability. In this study, the
   efflorescence appearance of structures was effectively reduced using
   calcium carbonate crystallization from the water purification and
   softening process to fill the pores in generic high-pressure bricks. The
   same water-to-binder ratio of 0.35 was used for three different mix
   proportions, and 20 cm x 20 cm x 6 cm general high-pressure bricks,
   calcium carbonate high-pressure bricks, and pervious bricks were made
   under a 50 kg/cm(2) molding pressure at a concrete-brick making plant.
   The samples were cured in five different environments with curing times
   of 2, 7, 28, 56 and 91 days. The effect of the curing age, the curing
   environment and the brick type on the hardness, solidity and appearance
   of efflorescence of the bricks were analyzed in terms of the compressive
   strength, the ultrasonic pulse velocity, and the coefficient of
   permeability, using Paint.net image analysis, scraping rate tests, SEM
   analysis and EDS analysis.
   The test results showed that the compressive strengths of the general
   high-pressure bricks, the calcium carbonate high-pressure bricks and the
   pervious bricks were 46.78 MPa-84.97 MPa, 56.89 MPa-100.23 MPa and 35.38
   MPa-59.20 MPa, respectively. The ultrasonic pulse velocities were 3296
   m/s-4524 m/s, 3567 m/s-5703 m/s and 2623 m/s-4319 m/s, respectively. The
   coefficient of permeability of the pervious bricks was larger than 1 x
   10-2 cm/sec. Quantitative analysis of efflorescence using Painet.net
   image analysis and scraping rate tests showed that the ratio of the
   efflorescence to the total area at the surface or bottom of the bricks
   and the scraping rate were larger for curing on hardened concrete than
   under other curing conditions. The efflorescence that was generated on
   the bottom layer of the bricks was higher than that on the surface layer
   by 5.31\%-19.82\%. Microscopic analysis of the specimens (SEM) showed
   the existence of many crystalloid Ca (OH)(2) colloids that accounted for
   20-25\% of the cement volume. EDS analysis showed that Ca was the main
   element in efflorescence, at 6.64\%, which was much higher than the
   percentage of other elements. To summarize the results, curing in a
   cling film seal can inhibit efflorescence crystallization. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{To the best of the authors' knowledge, this Letter reports and validates
   for the first time an on-chip reseTable test method that can be used to
   in-situ evaluate the impact reliability of a process-related silicon
   microbeam. A test structure integrating impact generating device, test
   samples, and a lock module is proposed to evaluate the impact-resistant
   reliability of the process-related microbeam samples with only a common
   optical microscope and probe station in the fabrication line. A
   calculation model that uses the LS-Dyna module in the finite-element
   commercial software ANSYS to process the test results is proposed to
   obtain the numerical parameters of the impact resistance reliability of
   the microbeam specimen. The test structure can be manufactured using a
   variety of mainstream MEMS silicon processes, so it can characterise the
   impact reliability of silicon microbeam structures under various
   processes. The above three parts constitute a self-aligned, low-cost
   test method with automation potential, which can be used for large-scale
   characterisation of the impact resistance reliability of silicon
   microbeam structures on the fabrication line. Finally, beam specimens
   under three different process conditions were manufactured and
   successfully evaluated using this test method, which verified the
   rationality of this method.}},

Title = {{Using network analysis to identify seasonal patterns and key nodes for
   risk-based surveillance of pig diseases in Italy}},
Journal = {{TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES}},
Abstract = {{The description of the pattern of livestock movements between herds
   provides essential information for both improving risk-based
   surveillance and to understand the likely spread of infectious diseases.
   This study provides a description of the temporal pattern of pig
   movements recorded in Italy on a 4-year period (2013-2016). Data,
   provided by the National Livestock registry, were described by social
   network analysis and the application of a walk-trap algorithm for
   community detection. Our results show a highly populated community
   located in Northern Italy, which is the focal point of the Italian
   industrial pig production and as a general pattern an overall decline of
   medium and backyard farms and an increase in the number of large farms,
   in agreement with the trend observed by other EU pig-producing
   countries. A seasonal pattern of all the parameters evaluated, including
   the number of active nodes in both the intensive and smaller production
   systems, emerged: that is characterized by a higher number of movements
   in spring and autumn, linked with the breeding and production cycle as
   pigs moved from the growing to the finishing phase and with periods of
   increased slaughtering at Christmas and Easter. The same pattern was
   found when restricting the analysis to imported pig batches. Outbreaks
   occurring during these periods would have a greater impact on the spread
   of infectious diseases; therefore, targeted surveillance may be
   appropriate. Finally, potential super-spreader nodes have been
   identified and represent 0.47\% of the total number of pig holdings (n =
   477). Those nodes are present during the whole study period with a
   similar ranking in their potential of being super-spreaders. Most of
   them were in Northern Italy, but super-spreaders with high mean
   out-degree centrality were also located in other Regions. Seasonality,
   communities and super-spreaders should be considered when planning
   surveillance activity and when applying disease control strategies.}},

Title = {{Personalizing the Top-k Spatial Keyword Preference Query with textual
   classifiers}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{162}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{The volume of data available online has increased considerably in the
   last years. Among this extensive amount, there is a specific kind called
   spatial data - a representation of a physical object using its spatial
   coordinates (e.g. latitude and longitude). Spatial queries are widely
   employed to manipulate spatial data more efficiently. However, the user
   has a crucial role in the spatial information retrieval process when
   querying the needed information. During the last few decades,
   researchers have proposed several techniques to aid users to express the
   information needed, such as boolean models, pattern matching operators,
   and query expansion. Despite the existence of significant alternatives
   to express the information need, there is still a lack of solutions
   applied to keyword preference queries. In this context, this work
   proposes a personalization approach to improve the Top-k Spatial Keyword
   Preference Query (SKPQ) results. By exploiting reviews on points of
   interest, the system identifies points which satisfy the user to order
   the result set with respect to his/her preference. The SKPQ result is
   compared to the one generated by our proposal using the OpinRank
   dataset. The assessment indicates a relative NDCG (Normalized Discounted
   Cumulative Gain) improvement of the proposed approach over the SKPQ of
   92\% when using random query keywords, and 33\% when using frequent
   keywords. This personalization approach can be applied to any spatial
   keyword query since it re-orders the results instead of modifying the
   query processing.}},

   (stabilised sands, coastal cliffs), their biological value, natural and
   anthropogenic threats and the risk category, according to the IUCN
   scale, which varies from vulnerable habitats to those in danger of
   extinction. Half the studied habitats are classified as vulnerable and
   others endangered. The latter corresponds to small populations located

Abstract = {{Mitigating the release of tritium produced from neutron irradiation of
   molten salts containing lithium or beryllium is a technical challenge
   for several advanced reactor designs. In a pebble bed
   Fluoride-Salt-Cooled High-Temperature Reactor (FHR), tritium generated
   in the Li2BeF4 (Flibe) coolant is expected to interact with the large
   inventory of graphite in the core. The degree to which tritium is
   retained in the FHR core graphite is important to understand in order to
   predict the tritium distribution in the reactor, operational dose rates
   in the plant, tritium source term, and optimal strategies to mitigate
   environmental release. Tritium retention in graphite is simulated in
   this work based on a model that considers tritium diffusion from Flibe
   into graphite pores as well as diffusion and trapping in graphite
   grains. The retention model was implemented into the TRIDENT model
   framework to study tritium transport at the FHR system level. Tritium
   permeation through the FHR primary heat exchanger was the largest source
   of release from the primary system, followed by tritium retention and
   recirculation of graphite fuel pebbles.}},

Title = {{Concurrent transfection of randomized transgene configurations into

   method for expression of complex molecules}},
Journal = {{BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2021}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Complex recombinant proteins are increasingly desired as potential
   therapeutic options for many disease indications and are commonly
   expressed in the mammalian Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Generally,
   stoichiometric expression and proper folding of all subunits of a
   complex recombinant protein are required to achieve the desired titers
   and product qualities for a complex molecule. Targeted integration (TI)
   cell line development (CLD), which entails the insertion of the desired
   transgene(s) into a predefined landing-pad in the CHO genome, enables
   the generation of a homogeneous pool of cells from which clonally stable
   and high titer clones can be isolated with minimal screening efforts.
   Despite these advantages, using a single transgene(s) configuration with
   predetermined gene dosage might not be adequate for the expression of
   complex molecules. The goal of this study is to develop a method for
   seamless screening of many vector configurations in a single TI CLD
   attempt. As testing vector configurations in transient expression
   systems is not predictive of protein expression in the stable cell lines
   and parallel TI CLDs with different transgene configurations is
   resource-intensive, we tested the concept of randomized configuration
   targeted integration (RCTI) CLD approach for expression of complex
   molecules. RCTI allows simultaneous transfection of multiple vector
   configurations, encoding a complex molecule, to generate diverse TI
   clones each with a single transgene configuration but clone specific
   productivity and product qualities. Our findings further revealed a
   direct correlation between transgenes' configuration/copy-number and
   titer/product quality of the expressed proteins. RCTI CLD enabled, with
   significantly fewer resources, seamless isolation of clones with
   comparable titers and product quality attributes to that of several
   parallel standard TI CLDs. Therefore, RCTI introduces randomness to the
   TI CLD platform while maintaining all the advantages, such as clone
   stability and reduced sequence variant levels, that the TI system has to
   offer.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Thioredoxin (Trx) is a small cellular redox protein with
   established antioxidant and disulfide reductase properties. We
   hypothesized that Trx deficiency in mice would cause increased oxidative
   stress with consequent redox imbalance that would exacerbate
   obesity-induced vascular dysfunction.
   Methods Non-transgenic (NT, C57BL/6) and dominant-negative Trx
   (dnTrx-Tg, low levels of redox-active protein) mice were either fed a
   normal diet (NC) or high fat diet plus sucrose (HFS) diet for 4 months
   (3-month HFD+ 1-month HFS). Weight gain, glucose tolerance test (GTT),
   insulin tolerance test (ITT), and other metabolic parameters were
   performed following NC or HFS diet. Arterial structural remodeling and
   functional parameters were assessed by myography.
   Results Our study found that dnTrx mice with lower levels of active Trx
   exacerbated myogenic tone, inward arterial remodeling, arterial
   stiffening, phenylephrine-induced contraction, and endothelial
   dysfunction of MA. Additionally, FeTMPyP, a peroxynitrite decomposition
   catalyst, acutely decreased myogenic tone and contraction and normalized
   endothelial function in MA from dnTrx-Tg mice on HFS via increasing
   nitric oxide (NO)-mediated relaxation.
   Conclusions Our results indicate that deficiency of active Trx
   exacerbates MA contractile and relaxing properties during diet-induced
   obesity demonstrating that loss of redox balance in obesity is a key
   mechanism of vascular endothelial dysfunction.}},

Abstract = {{COVID-19 pandemic has been affecting the whole world by increasing
   morbidity and mortality rates day by day. Treatment algorithms have been
   attempted as parallel to the increasing experience with COVID-19. In the
   pathogenesis of this virus pro-inflammatory cytokine storm has been
   called to have the main role. The right timing should be made for
   treatments. We proposed IL- 1 blocking by anakinra in seventeen COVID-19
   patients at high risk of worsening. Patients were assessed according to
   HScore, SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score = SOFA), MuLBSTA
   Score (multilobular infiltration, hypo-lymphocytosis, bacterial
   coinfection, smoking history, hyper-tension, and age), Brescia-COVID
   respiratory severity scale (BCRSS). In our study, the mortality rate was
   17.6\%. Consequently, 1 (5.9\%) patient was receiving low-flow oxygen
   supply, 3 (17.6\%) patients needed no longer oxygen supply and 10
   (58.8\%) patients were discharged from the hospital. According to the
   results of our study in the manner of general evaluation; we found that
   SOFA, MuLBSTA, and BCRSS scores were one step ahead according to HScore
   being insufficient to determine early phases of the disease. In our
   opinion, the prominent factors that emphasize the use of anakinra could
   be listed as comorbidity, risk, or presence of secondary infection,
   ongoing malignant disease. However, the other factors that enhance the
   use of anakinra in the situation of viremia also could be sorted as no
   response to full dose antivirals, antiviral side effects, or no success
   to antiviral treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of the study is to determine the prevalence of
   stress and to identify the occupational stressors among Lebanese police
   officers. Design/methodology/approach Operational Police Stress
   Questionnaire (PSQ-op) was addressed to 100 randomly selected male
   Lebanese Police officers. Twenty items from the PSQ-op were run through
   the principal component analysis to determine the most significant
   factors of stress and loading within each of the factors. Findings The
   results indicated that 59\% of officers reported moderate stress level
   and 41\% reported strenuous stress. Principal component analysis
   identified six independent factors or stress among Lebanese police
   officers explaining in total 72.1\% of the total variance: excessive
   workload (30.6\%), social-life time management (12.8\%), occupational
   fitness (9.1\%), success-related stress (8.6\%), physical and
   psychological health (5.8\%), and working alone at night (5.2\%).
   Research limitations/implications This research approach encountered
   some limitations so further research must: use a larger sample size,
   include female gender and identify other sources of stressors mainly
   organizational or job context stressors. Originality/value Addressing
   and understanding stress factors among Lebanese police officers helps
   improving awareness and developing individualized treatment strategies
   leading police officers to engage in stress-management training to learn
   coping strategies and use effective tools for preventing stress before
   it becomes chronic.}},

   cementitious hydration phases from microstructural chemical maps}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{265}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates the use of normalized intensities of chemical
   species obtained from energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) as
   inputs to machine learning (ML) models, in order to predict the
   nanoindentation moduli (M) of different phases in a cementitious matrix.
   Single and multi-component blends belonging to conventional and
   ultra-high performance (UHP) pastes are evaluated using a variety of ML
   models. It is shown that the relative intensities of Ca, Si, and Al can
   be used to accurately predict the phase moduli in well-hydrated pastes
   with limited microstructural complexities, using all the ML models
   investigated. When data sets belonging to multiple binders or those for
   UHP pastes consisting of multiple materials and low degrees of reaction
   are considered, the accuracy of ML predictions are found to be
   significantly lower. This is partly attributable to the presence of
   mixed phases with widely differing chemistry-property relationships, and
   the lack of data for higher stiffness phases that exaggerate the
   skew-sensitivity of ML models like ANN. Potential data augmentation
   strategies to tide over some of these effects are suggested. (C) 2020

Volume = {{76}},

Abstract = {{In warm-temperate regions, the adoption of warm-season forage grasses
   has been hindered by low and unpredictable seedling emergence because of
   seed dormancy. Developing models driven by temperature (T) and soil
   water potential (psi) may provide tools for choosing adequate sowing
   conditions. Models are usually developed with controlled chamber
   germination data, but they can be built using field emergence and
   weather station data. Seedling emergence data of four Paspalum
   populations (two dallisgrass subspecies, bahiagrass and vaseygrass) were
   gathered from five experiments in three Campos locations (Buenos Aires,
   Montevideo and Salto) during two years, with fall and spring sowing
   dates and irrigated and non-irrigated plots. Thermal and hydrothermal
   time models were used for emergence timing. The predictions were better
   for irrigated plots and fall sowings. For maximum emergence proportion
   (MEP), a mixed linear model was adjusted. Within a non-irrigated
   treatment, the higher MEP was for early-spring sowings, but the lowest
   for late-spring ones. Additionally, a thermal time index (TTI) was
   modified to model MEP. A coefficient which weighs degree-days
   accumulation according to the hydrothermal range (HTR) of each day was
   set. The HTRs were defined by T and psi thresholds. Thresholds and
   coefficient values were optimized by genotype until linear regressions
   between MEP and modified TTI achieved higher fit. Days with high
   temperature (>18 degrees C or 20 degrees C according to genotype)
   accumulated half or none of degree-days when high- or mid-soil water
   content was available, respectively. Differences among Paspalum
   genotypes, sowing date recommendations and modified TTI usefulness were
   discussed.}},

   structures based on spatially distributed strain data. Specifically, the
   study aims to provide an adequate structural interpretation of the
   readings, which infers the structural health. It is especially relevant
   for RC structures, that are designed to be cracked during their service
   life. To meet this goal the study correlates damage induced by cracks
   and curvature computed from strains to analyze 2D RC structures
   characterised by directional strains, and moment redistribution. The
   study also considered the installation possibilities and the limited and
   thus averaged strain data. To exclusively correlate changes in
   curvatures, by means of curvature index factors, and residual bending
   stiffness distribution, the study proposed an iterative identification
   algorithm. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the algorithm by
   numerical simulations of strain measurements and considers the various
   limitations of the adopted strain measurements along large 2D RC
   structures. It is presented that the procedure succeeds in localising
   the damaged regions and provides less accurate, but still contributive,
   assessment of their severity. Thus, the proposed method can support
   engineers in decision making regarding the structural health of the
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{We study the effect of loop corrections to conformal correlators on the
   celestial sphere at null infinity. We fast analyze fmite one-loop
   celestial amplitudes in pure Yang-Mills theory and Einstein gravity. We
   then turn to our main focus: infrared divergent loop amplitudes in
   planar N = 4 super-Yang-Mills theory. We compute the celestial one-loop
   amplitude in dimensional regularization and show that it can be recast
   as an operator acting on the celestial tree-level amplitude. This
   extends to any loop order, and the resummation of all planar loops
   enables us to write down an expression for the all-loop celestial
   amplitude. Finally, we show that the exponentiated all-loop expression
   given by the Bern-Dixon-Smirnov (BDS) formula gets promoted on the
   celestial sphere to an operator acting on the tree-level conformal
   correlation function, thus yielding, the celestial BDS formula.}},

Title = {{Performance of Hybrid RF/FSO Cooperative Systems Based on Quasicyclic
   LDPC Codes and Space-Coupled LDPC Codes}},
Journal = {{WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Free space optical (FSO) communication systems provide wireless line of
   sight connectivity in the unlicensed spectrum, and wireless optical
   communication achieves higher data rates compared to their radio
   frequency (RF) counterparts. FSO systems are particularly attractive for
   last mile access problem by bridging fiber optic backbone connectivity
   to RF access networks. To cope with this practical deployment scenario,
   there has been increasing attention to the so-called dual-hop (RF/FSO)
   systems where RF transmission is used at a hop followed by FSO
   transmission to another. In this article, we study the performance of
   cooperative transmission systems using a mixed RF-FSO DF (decode and
   forward) relay using error-correcting codes including QC-LDPC codes at
   the relay level. The FSO link is modeled by the gamma-gamma
   distribution, and the RF link is modeled by the Additive White Gaussian
   Noise (AWGN) model. Another innovation in this article is the use of
   cooperative systems using a mixed FSO/RF DF relay using quasicyclic
   low-density parity check (QC-LDPC) codes at the relay level. We also use
   the space-coupled low-density parity check (SC-LDPC) codes on the same
   scheme to show its importance in cooperative optical transmission but
   also in hybrid RF/FSO transmission. The latter will be compared with
   QC-LDPC codes. The use of mixed RF/FSO cooperative transmission systems
   can improve the reliability and transmission of information in networks.
   The results demonstrate an improvement in the performance of the
   cooperative RF/FSO DF system based on QC-LDPC and SC-LDPC codes compared
   to RF/FSO systems without the use of codes, but also to the DF systems
   proposed in the existing literature.}},

Title = {{Relaxed Locally Correctable Codes}},
Journal = {{THEORY OF COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{Locally decodable codes (LDCs) and locally correctable codes (LCCs) are
   error-correcting codes in which individual bits of the message and
   codeword, respectively, can be recovered by querying only a few bits
   from a noisy codeword. These codes have found numerous applications both
   in theory and in practice.
   A natural relaxation of LDCs, introduced by Ben-Sasson et al. (SICOMP,
   2006), allows the decoder to reject (i.e., refuse to answer) in case it
   detects that the codeword is corrupt. They call such a decoder a relaxed
   decoder and construct a constant-query relaxed LDC with nearly linear
   block length, whereas the state-of-the-art (full-fledged) LDCs in the
   constant-query regime have superpolynomial block length.
   We consider an analogous relaxation for local correction. Thus, a
   relaxed local corrector reads only few bits from a (possibly) corrupt
   codeword and either recovers the desired bit of the codeword, or rejects
   in case it detects corruption.
   We give constructions of relaxed LCCs in two regimes, where the first
   optimizes the query complexity and the second optimizes the rate.
   1. Constant Query Complexity: A relaxed LCC with polynomial block length
   whose corrector only reads a constant number of bits of the codeword. In
   contrast, the best upper bound on the block length achieved by known
   q-query (full-fledged) LCCs, for constant q, is exp(O(n(1/(q-1)))).
   2. Constant Rate: A relaxed LCC with constant rate (i. e., linear block
   length) with quasi-polylogarithmic query complexity (specifically,
   exp(O(log log n)(2))). In contrast, the best known upper bound on the
   query complexity of constant-rate (full-fledged) LCCs is exp((O) over
   tilde(root logn)) (Kopparty et al., STOC'16). Our construction, however,
   is based on a locally testable code constructed by Kopparty et al.,
   which we show to allow for relaxed local correction with better
   parameters.}},

Title = {{Laser sintered PbSe semiconductor thin films for Mid-IR applications
   using nanocrystals}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{849}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{Interests in group IV-VI compound semiconductors for MWIR applications
   have undergone multiple resurgences over the last 70 years due to the
   high IR responsivity. Many research groups have shown they can achieve
   high IR response by making modification of the sensitization process;
   however, nearly all are using traditional deposition methods (Chemical
   Bath Deposition or Chemical/Physical Vapor Deposition) involving complex
   chemical processing or vacuum-based equipment. This work introduces a
   flexible alternative method for producing ultrapure polycrystalline thin
   films with exceptional morphological control. The process utilizes a
   planetary ball-mill to wet-mill ultra-pure crystalline ingot into
   colloidal nanocrystals (NC), followed by rapid deposition in a
   centrifuge to form a compact, thin film across a silicon substrate.
   Laser sintering is then used to rapidly form a continuous denser film
   with excellent substrate adhesion and unique control of the
   morphological properties. This work demonstrates a new method using
   laser sintering that can form a 1.5 mu m thin film of PbSe with
   equivalent physical and electrical (p-type with a carrier concentration
   of 4.5 x 10(17)/cm(3) and resistivity value of 0.17 Omega cm) properties
   to CBD/PVD. The results are presented for the process development, film
   morphology, crystal structure, and electrical properties. Lastly, unlike
   traditional deposition methods, this alternative process is
   environmentally responsible by producing zero hazardous waste by
   allowing recovery of all unused PbSe for reuse. The reported method is
   applicable for achieving thin films from a variety of high purity bulk
   materials. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Mg isotopic systematics during early diagenetic aragonite-calcite
   transition: Insights from the Key Largo Limestone}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{558}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{The seawater magnesium (Mg) isotopic composition (delta Mg-26(SW)) can
   be applied to quantify marine Mg cycle in Earth's history. However,
   reconstruction of delta Mg-26(SW) by using marine carbonate has been
   challenged by the large range of variation in Mg isotopic composition of
   carbonate (delta Mg-26(carb)). Such variation, on the one hand,
   reflects, e.g. the mineralogy, temperature, and precipitation rate
   dependent isotopic fractionation during Ca-carbonate precipitation. On
   the other hand, the pristine seawater record could be modified in
   carbonate diagenesis, during which less stable carbonate minerals would
   spontaneously convert to more stable mineral phases. In the modern ocean
   with high Mg/Ca (molar) ratio (similar to 5), aragonite precipitation is
   favored. However, aragonite is thermodynamically less stable than low-Mg
   calcite at ambient surface environment, resulting in the spontaneous
   transition from aragonite to low-Mg calcite in the earliest stage of
   diagenesis (i.e. the aragonite-calcite transition). As a common process
   in the modern ocean, Mg isotopic fractionation in aragonite-calcite
   transition may provide valuable constraints on the variation of delta
   Mg-26(carb). In this study, we measured Mg isotopic compositions of
   Pleistocene Key Largo Limestone (Florida), which has been experiencing
   the aragonite-calcite transition during early diagenesis. The Key Largo
   Limestone samples consist of a mixture of calcite and aragonite. delta
   Mg-26 of aragonite (delta Mg-26(arag)) shows higher and more stable
   values, while calcite has lower yet more variable Mg isotopes (delta
   Mg-26(cal)). We suggest a model conceptualizing a water-film attached to
   the mineral surface, in which the aragonite-calcite transition initiates
   with aragonite dissolution and the Mg exchange with external fluid can
   be variable, followed by Mg isotopes fractionate during low-Mg calcite
   precipitation. In this model, delta Mg-26(cal) is controlled by (1) the
   chemical composition of water-film, which is dependent on the
   mineralogical composition of aragonite (i.e. Mg content and delta
   Mg-26(arag)), the composition of external fluid (i.e. fresh water,
   seawater, or mixed fresh water and seawater), and the mixing ratio
   between dissolved aragonite and external fluid, and (2) the isotopic
   fractionation during calcite precipitation. Because the isotopic
   fractionation in calcite is sensitive to the rate of calcite
   precipitation that is dependent on the calcite saturation state of
   solution. Therefore, delta Mg-26(cal) could be highly heterogeneous
   depending on the aragonite dissolution and calcite precipitation
   processes, further complicating the interpretation of carbonate data.
   Thus, the process-controlled Mg isotopic fractionation should be taken
   into consideration when reconstructing delta Mg-26(SW) by using
   carbonate sediments/rocks.}},

   curriculum making as relational practice and to examine the structure,
   composition and the content of teachers' networks by drawing upon a
   critical realist perspective. Findings suggested that the qualities the
   relationships possess (relational goods \& evils), context (national and

   understand how teachers-mediated curriculum making through their

Abstract = {{BackgroundAge and time information stored within the histories of
   clinical notes can provide valuable insights for assessing a patient's
   disease risk, understanding disease progression, and studying
   therapeutic outcomes. However, details of age and temporally-specified
   clinical events are not well captured, consistently codified, and
   readily available to research databases for study.MethodsWe expanded
   upon existing annotation schemes to capture additional age and temporal
   information, conducted an annotation study to validate our expanded
   schema, and developed a prototypical, rule-based Named Entity Recognizer
   to extract our novel clinical named entities (NE). The annotation study
   was conducted on 138 discharge summaries from the pre-annotated 2014
   ShARe/CLEF eHealth Challenge corpus. In addition to existing NE classes
   (TIMEX3, SUBJECT\_CLASS, DISEASE\_DISORDER), our schema proposes 3
   additional NEs (AGE, PROCEDURE, OTHER\_EVENTS). We also propose new
   attributes, e.g., ``degree\_relation{''} which captures the degree of
   biological relation for subjects annotated under SUBJECT\_CLASS. As a
   proof of concept, we applied the schema to 49 H\&P notes to encode
   pertinent history information for a lung cancer cohort study.ResultsAn
   abundance of information was captured under the new OTHER\_EVENTS,
   PROCEDURE and AGE classes, with 23\%, 10\% and 8\% of all annotated NEs
   belonging to the above classes, respectively. We observed high
   inter-annotator agreement of >80\% for AGE and TIMEX3; the automated NLP
   system achieved F1 scores of 86\% (AGE) and 86\% (TIMEX3). Age and
   temporally-specified mentions within past medical, family, surgical, and
   social histories were common in our lung cancer data set; annotation is
   ongoing to support this translational research study.ConclusionsOur
   annotation schema and NLP system can encode historical events from
   clinical notes to support clinical and translational research studies.}},

Abstract = {{The space industry is expanding at an increasing rate. While most
   efforts are currently focused on Earth and lunar orbits, it is only a
   matter of time before affordable exploration missions into deep space
   become more prevalent. Nuclear electric propulsion (NEP) with large
   quantities of power have been theorized for such missions with many
   advantages over traditional solar panels and radioisotope power sources.
   Key among NEP issues has been the power conversion system, often falling
   upon dynamic cycles over solid-state options like thermoelectric
   generators (TEGs) because of low efficiencies. Howe Industries has
   conceptualized a deep space probe capable of transporting cube
   satellites (CubeSats) and other payloads to deep space utilizing NEP
   based on an advanced TEG power conversion system with efficiencies that
   would challenge traditional dynamic power conversion cycles.
   Experimentation at a TRIGA research reactor has shown a potential for 20
   to 50 times increase in electrical conductivity of potential
   thermoelectric materials, which would correlate to large increases in
   efficiencies over traditional TEGs.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Aim Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common cancers among men in
   the world. Prostate-specific antigen is the most used biomarker for PCa
   diagnosis. In this study, we aimed to measure the procalcitonin (PCT)
   and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in patients with PCa.
   Methods The patients who underwent transrectal prostate biopsy and
   transurethral prostate surgery in the last 4 years were included in the
   study. The patients were divided into two groups according to the
   pathology reports, group1; benign prostate hyperplasia and group2;
   prostate cancer. MedCalc Statistical Software version 17.6 was used for
   statistical analyses.
   Results The current study includes 149 patients. There were 118 patients
   in group 1 and 31 patients in group 2. The mean age of the patients was
   66.85 and 69.41 years in groups respectively. Serum CRP and PCT levels
   were 3.33 and 0.01 in group 4.07 and 0.04 in group 2. Serum PCT levels
   were significantly higher in patients with PCa.
   Conclusion We found that the elevated procalcitonin level was associated

Abstract = {{This paper presents a dialectometric analysis of Scottish Gaelic
   morphology, with a focus on the noun phrase, using previously
   unpublished data from the Linguistic Survey of Scotland. Fifty-five
   morphological features were extracted across 201 survey points, and the
   data subjected to a variety of analyses, including cluster analysis,
   regression, and correlation analysis. We establish that the Gaelic noun
   system shows robust diatopic (i.e. geographical) variation; this
   challenges previous assertions in the literature, which describe Gaelic
   morphosyntax as geographically uniform. In addition, we argue that our
   dialectometric results provide an insight into the grammatical structure
   of the language that is not easily achievable through the analysis of
   individual varieties. In particular, we argue that the results highlight
   a dissociation between morphological categories such as case and gender
   and their morphophonological exponents, which are particularly complex
   in Scottish Gaelic. The paper thus serves as a proof of concept for the
   use of dialectometric findings in a theoretical context.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   There are many reports of Achilles tendon lengthening procedures for
   equinus deformity of the ankle. We previously modified an Achilles
   tendon lengthening to prevent overextension with a locking mechanism
   suture before performing a sliding lengthening. The purpose of this
   study was to compare the biomechanical properties of the locking
   mechanism suture with sliding lengthening (L-SL) and Z-lengthening (ZL)
   using a rabbit model.
   Methods
   Thirty-six male Japanese white rabbits were assigned to two groups -
   half undergoing the L-SL technique and half undergoing the ZL technique
   on the flexor hallucis longus (FHL) tendon. Six rabbits in each group
   were sacrificed at one week, three weeks, and six weeks postoperatively
   and evaluated, while five rabbits underwent radiographical and
   biomechanical evaluation and one underwent histological evaluation.
   Results
   In extension length, L-SL was significantly lower than ZL one week
   postoperatively. In the L-SL group, elongation one week postoperatively
   was significantly lower than that three and six weeks postoperatively.
   In the ultimate failure load, L-SL was significantly higher than ZL one
   and three weeks after lengthening. In the L-SL group, the ultimate
   failure load one week postoperatively was significantly lower than that
   three and six weeks postoperatively. In the ZL group, there were
   significant differences at all time points.
   Conclusion
   L-SL had higher mechanical property in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{The design brief informs particularly the first phases of the design
   process; however, there are very limited studies on its role and
   functions. The current study proposes a framework that relates problem
   statement types in a design brief to creative outcomes by promoting the
   priming effect, which is a cognitive phenomenon describing the ways
   individuals behave accordingly to the way they receive a stimulus. The
   claim is that the brief has the potential to stimulate creativity and
   influence the type of outcomes by priming the design students using the
   problem statement. An experiment was conducted in which two groups of
   design students generated sketches in response to two types of problem
   statements (in noun and verb formations) in similar design briefs. The
   problem statements in verb formation were found to lead to a higher
   number of sketches containing more novel and flexible, yet less
   realisable ideas. The results support the contention that the design
   brief and the type of problem statements have the potential to act as a
   catalyst for creativity early in the design process.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, an induction heating (IH) application is carried out by
   transferring the maximum power extracted from photovoltaic (PV) panels
   to the stainless steel with the designed regular and irregular 32 pulse
   density modulation (PDM) controlled series resonant inverter. The main
   objective of this study is to analyse the changes in the system due to
   regular and irregular PDM patterns. Maximum power point tracker (MPPT)
   is used to control the output power at different solar irradiation
   values with varying PDM patterns. Regular and irregular PDM control
   methods are compared in terms of MPPT efficiency, cost, algorithm
   complexity, logic control structure and current/voltage stresses of the
   power switches. Zero current switching (ZCS) conditions are provided by
   using phase locked loop (PLL) technique at all power points of the PV
   system. The appropriate switching conditions are tracked continuously at
   resonant frequency, and therefore soft switching is realised. Perturb
   and observe (P\&O) algorithm is used with the aim of tracking the
   maximum power in PV panels and high tracking efficiency is obtained with
   PDM-controlled P\&O MPPT algorithm. ATMEL328P-AU microcontroller is used
   to control the inverter in the system.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of a single screen and treat strategy to detect asymptomatic
   malaria among pregnant women from selected health facilities in Lindi
   region, Tanzania}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundIn areas of high transmission, malaria in pregnancy (MiP)
   primarily causes asymptomatic infections; these infections nonetheless
   increase the risk of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. In 2014,
   Tanzania initiated a single screening and treatment (SST) strategy for
   all pregnant women at their first antenatal care (ANC) visit using
   malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) for surveillance purposes. However,
   there is paucity of data on the effectiveness of SST in the prevention
   of MiP. The objective of this study was to estimate the number of
   asymptomatic infections among pregnant women detected by SST, which
   would have been missed in the absence of the policy.MethodsData from
   pregnant women attending their first ANC visits between October 2017 and
   June 2018, including gestational age, history of fever, and RDT results,
   were abstracted from ANC registers in eight health centres in two
   randomly selected districts, Kilwa and Lindi, in Lindi Region. The
   proportion of symptomatic (with history of fever in the past 48 h) and
   asymptomatic pregnant women with positive RDTs were calculated and
   stratified by trimester (first, second and third). The study areas were
   categorized as low transmission with prevalence<10\% or moderate/high
   with<greater than or equal to>10\%.ResultsOver the study period, 1,845
   women attended their first ANC visits; 22.1\% were in the first
   trimester (<12 weeks gestation age). Overall 15.0\% of the women had
   positive RDTs, and there was a trend towards higher malaria prevalence
   in the first (15.9\%) and second (15.2\%) trimesters, compared to the
   third (7.1\%), although the differences were not statistically
   significant (p=0.07). In total, 6.9\% of women reported fever within the
   past 48 h and, of these, 96.1\% were RDT positive. For every 100
   pregnant women in the moderate/high and low transmission areas, SST
   identified 60 and 26 pregnant women, respectively, with asymptomatic
   infections that would have otherwise been missed. Among the 15.9\% of
   women detected in the first trimester, 50.7\% were
   asymptomatic.ConclusionIn areas of moderate/high transmission, many
   infected women were asymptomatic, and would have been missed in the
   absence of SST. The benefits on maternal and fetal birth outcomes of
   identifying these infections depend heavily on the protection afforded
   by treatment, which is likely to be greatest for women presenting in the
   first trimester when intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp) with
   sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is contraindicated, and in areas with
   high SP resistance, such as most parts of Tanzania. An evaluation of the
   impact and cost-effectiveness of SST across different transmission
   strata is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{This study explored how domain-specific perfectionism (academic, social,
   physical appearance) among high school freshmen relates to internalizing
   symptoms using critical elements of expectancy-value theory (i.e.,
   domain value and competence) as moderators. Results indicate that
   perfectionism across all domains was positively and significantly
   related to internalizing symptoms. Within the social domain, social
   value was a significant moderator of the relation between perfectionism
   and internalizing symptoms, and perceived social competence was a
   significant moderator of that moderation effect (i.e., at higher levels
   of social value and lower levels of perceived social competence, the
   relation between perfectionism and internalizing symptoms was the
   strongest). These findings provide support for the use of the
   expectancy-value model to predict mental health symptoms in the social
   domain and suggest the importance of addressing domain-specific
   perfectionism in the schools.}},

Title = {{Contribution of the Darwin operator to non-leptonic decays of heavy
   quarks}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{We compute the Darwin operator contribution (1/mb3</mml:msubsup>
   correction) to the width of the inclusive non-leptonic decay of a B
   meson (B+, B-d or B-s), stemming from the quark flavour-changing
   transition b -> q1q<overbar></mml:mover>2q3, where q(1), q(2) = u, c and
   q(3) = d, s. The key ideas of the computation are the local expansion of
   the quark propagator in the external gluon field including terms with a
   covariant derivative of the gluon field strength tensor and the standard
   technique of the Heavy Quark Expansion (HQE). We confirm the previously
   known expressions of the 1/mb3</mml:msubsup> contributions to the
   semi-leptonic decay b -> <mml:msub>q1l<mml:msub>nu <mml:mo
   stretchy={''}true{''}><overbar></mml:mover>l, with l = e, mu, tau and of
   the 1<mml:mo>/mb2 contributions to the non-leptonic modes. We find that
   this new term can give a sizeable correction of about -4 \% to the
   non-leptonic decay width of a B meson. For B-d and B-s mesons this turns
   out to be the dominant correction to the free b-quark decay, while for
   the B+ meson the Darwin term gives the second most important correction
   - roughly 1/2 to 1/3 of the phase space enhanced Pauli interference
   contribution. Due to the tiny experimental uncertainties in lifetime
   measurements the incorporation of the Darwin term contribution is
   crucial for precision tests of the Standard Model.}},

Abstract = {{DC transformer plays a significant role in DC distributed network. This
   study proposes a modular multilevel dynamic DC transformer (MMDT), which
   can realise smooth control of transformer ratio, multi-level voltage
   conversion, and reliable fault isolation without high-frequency
   transformers and extra loss. The inner circuit, formed by the
   capacitors, not only realises the energy exchange between different
   sides but also provides the capability of fault isolation. In the
   proposed MMDT, the voltage transforming is realised by switching to
   different numbers of control units (CUs) on each side. To realise
   multi-level voltage transforming, the multi-port MMDT is developed.
   Furthermore, this study offers analyses of the current and voltage
   characteristics in steady-state and investigates the parameter design
   method in detail. Finally, the simulation and experiment tests are
   conducted to verify the feasibility and superiority of the proposed
   MMDT.}},

Journal = {{GENE}},

Abstract = {{Neuropathic pain is caused by damage or disease happened to
   somatosensory nerve system. Due to the high prevalence and inefficient
   clinic intervention, neuropathic pain has brought considerable burden
   for world health care system. It is urgent to find novel targets for
   neuropathic pain basic research and clinical management. In this study,
   we found that miR-22-3p was decreased in Chronic Constriction Injury
   (CCI)rats and involved in neuropathic pain progression. Furthermore, it
   was found that ENO1 was a downstream target of miR-22-3p using
   bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assays. MiR-22-3p
   downregulation promoted neuropathic pain via regulating inflammation
   factors expression by targeting ENO1. Then, we explored the upstream
   regulator of miR-22-3p using Miranda database. It was found that
   circular RNA ZNF609 sponged miR-223p by biotinylated RNA pull-down,
   AGO2-RIP, and luciferase reporter assays. Collectively, our study
   revealed that circZNF609 promoted inflammation factors expression to
   aggravate neuropathic pain progression via miR-22-3p/ENO1 axis in CCI
   rat models. Our study might provide a new direction for neuropathic pain

Abstract = {{A mechanical disintegration of waste wood biomass and freeze-induced
   assembly of colloidal nanowood were effectively deployed to explore
   ion-associated cellular foams (NWFs) with unidirectional channels. Under
   the assistance of inorganic ions, the as-fabricated foams were
   significantly enhanced in physical stability, compressive strength,
   flame retardancy, and thermal barrier, accounting for the tuning effects
   of pores and channels, surface charges, and microphase interaction by
   ion effects and freeze orientation. As a result, the vascular-like
   ion-doped channels benefited from quick capillary liquid transport.
   Under 1 sun illumination, NWF-V as a 3-D evaporator exhibited a high
   evaporation rate of 1.50 kg m(-2) h(-1) and a conversion efficiency of
   up to 88.9\% for seawater desalination. Dramatically, an average of 12.5
   kg m(-2) of fresh water could be generated on each sunny day by outdoor
   NWFs for durability beyond 15 days. Under the drive of fuel combustion,
   an efficient conveying of ethanol or pump oil could be at rates of 0.44
   and 0.26 mL min(-1), respectively. Moreover, combustion flame with
   variable color was generated according to the doping cations in NWFs.
   Therefore, sustainable, green, facile, and multifunctional wood-based
   cellular foams could be tailored, scaled-up, and applied as color flame
   burners or desalination evaporators under combustion or solar drive in

Abstract = {{Background. Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a clinical syndrome
   with acute jaundice and coagulation dysfunction caused by various
   inducements on the basis of chronic liver disease. Western medical
   treatment is limited. Previous studies have confirmed that Jieduan-Niwan
   Formula (JDNW Formula), an empirical prescription for the treatment of
   ACLF, can inhibit inflammation and resist hepatocyte apoptosis. However,
   potential targets and mechanisms still need to be explored. Methods. In
   this study, network pharmacological analysis was performed to
   investigate the key components and potential mechanisms of JDNW Formula
   treating ACLF. Firstly, we predicted the potential active ingredients of
   JDNW Formula and the corresponding potential targets through TCMSP,
   BATMAN-TCM platform, and literature supplement. Then, the ACLF targets
   database was built using OMIM, DisGeNET, and GeneCard database. Based on
   the matching targets between JDNW Formula and ACLF, the PPI network was
   constructed for MCODE analysis and common targets were enriched by
   Metascape. Furthermore, the ACLF rat model was used to verify the
   potential mechanism of JDNW Formula in treating ACLF. Results. 132
   potential bioactive components of JDNW Formula and 168 common targets
   were obtained in this study. The enrichment analysis shows that the AMPK
   signaling pathway was associated with the treating effects of JDNW
   Formula. Quercetin was hypothesized to be the key bioactive ingredient
   in JDNW Formula and has a good binding affinity to AMPK based on
   molecular docking verification. JDNW Formula and quercetin were verified
   to treat ACLF by regulating the AMPK/PGC-1 alpha signaling pathway as a
   prediction. Conclusion. The study predicted potential mechanisms of JDNW
   Formula in the treatment of ACLF, involving downregulation of
   inflammatory factor expression, antioxidant stress, and inhibition of
   hepatocyte apoptosis. JDNW Formula may improve mitochondrial quality in
   ACLF via the AMPK signaling pathway, which serves as a guide for further
   study.}},

Abstract = {{Finding DNA sequences that can strongly adsorb on various nanomaterials
   is critically important for preparing bioconjugates, biosensors, and
   drug delivery. Poly-cytosine (poly-C) DNA is found to have stronger
   affinity compared to other DNA sequences of the same length on various
   nanomaterials ranging from graphene oxide (GO), MoS2, to many metal
   oxides and phosphates. In this work, the authors aim to understand the
   reason for such high affinity by varying pH and DNA sequence along with
   conducting molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using GO as a model
   surface. Poly-C DNA adsorbs stronger only at neutral or basic pH, while
   its adsorption at acidic pH is weaker than other DNA homopolymers. The
   DNA sequence is further varied by inserting thymine into poly-C DNA and
   by varying thymine/cytosine ratios, all confirming that a folded i-motif
   structure is detrimental for adsorption. Using MD simulations, the
   authors reveal that the stronger adsorption of poly-C DNA at neutral pH
   is due to more contributions from the phosphate backbone hydrogen
   bonding with GO surface relating to the flexibility of the DNA. Poly-C
   DNA also uses its phosphate backbone to interact with metal oxide and
   phosphate nanoparticles, and this phosphate backbone interaction can
   unify all these observations.}},

Title = {{Cultural-historical study of crises in child role adjustment during
   transition to school within a bi-cultural context}},
Journal = {{EARLY CHILD DEVELOPMENT AND CARE}},
Abstract = {{There is a consensusthat the crises children encounter during the
   transition period might impact negatively on children's learning and
   development. However, from cultural-historical perspective, qualitative
   leap in development can hardly be achieved without crises. This paper,
   drawing upon cultural-historical theory as the framework and by using
   `role adjustment' as the unit of analysis, discusses what the crisis
   means for children's learning and development. Through a case study of
   two second generation Chinese Australian children's role adjustmentin
   school transition, this paper finds that the crises provide both
   potentials and dangers depending on how the crises are managed within
   the child's social situation of development. It argues against the
   advocates for making children's transition seamless, as it is important
   to utilize the developmental potentials of crises instead of eliminating
   them. It also enriches the cultural-historical studies by exploring not
   only the developmental aspect but also the dark side of the crises.}},

Title = {{Random generation of 2D PFC microstructures through DEM gravimetric
   methods}},
Journal = {{ROAD MATERIALS AND PAVEMENT DESIGN}},
Abstract = {{Computational mechanics has proven to be a useful method to understand
   and assess the mechanical behaviour and main degradation mechanisms of
   Porous Friction Courses (PFC) at the microstructural level. However, a
   common limitation when preparing these models is the difficulty to
   achieve realistic microstructures. The ideal model to evaluate the
   mechanical behaviour and the degradation mechanisms of PFCs would use a
   three-dimensional (3D) geometry of the mixture with realistic aggregate
   shape, angularity, and gradation. However, these models are
   computationally expensive and typically related with numerical
   instabilities. This paper proposes a novel methodology to generate
   two-dimensional (2D) random PFC microstructures using gravimetric
   methods through Discrete Element Method (DEM) modelling. The proposed
   methodology was calibrated to generate coarse aggregates with realistic
   and controlled morphological properties. The produced 2D microstructures
   were implemented in the commercial Finite Element Method (FEM) software
   Abaqus (R) and, after coating the particles with asphalt mortar, they
   were used to verify that the microstructures were able to reproduce the
   mechanical response -measured through the dynamic axial modulus- of an
   actual PFC mixture tested in the laboratory. The results show that the
   proposed methodology is able to produce microstructures with the same
   dynamic modulus than an actual PFC mixture at different loading
   frequencies. Among other applications, this methodology could be used to
   estimate the mechanical properties of PFC mixtures or to assess the
   expected performance and durability of a specific PFC under realistic
   field conditions.}},

Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{265}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{According to the literature, an efficient method to improve properties
   of rubberwood to be suitable for structural use is still required. In
   this work, a novel densifying method for the development of high
   strength rubberwood for this application was introduced. The method
   consists of three main steps including pre-compression of rubberwood raw
   material, impregnation of pre-compressed rubberwood with methyl
   methacrylate (MMA) and mechanical compression of MMA-impregnated
   pre-compressed rubberwood. Effects of targeted compression ratios used
   during compression on the properties of the obtained rubberwood was
   explored. The result showed that the properties of the obtained
   rubberwood were dependent on the compression ratios and most of them had
   greatly improved compared with that of original rubberwood or densified
   rubberwood reported elsewhere. Interestingly, properties of the obtained
   densified rubberwood were higher compared with that of typical softwood
   and hardwood provided in a wood handbook. Note that, it is possible to
   scale up the proposed method to industrial production level because it
   requires simple steps. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Dual-redox metallo-supramolecular polymers with a zigzag structure
   (polyFe-N and polyRu-N) were successfully synthesized by 1:1
   complexation of a redox-active Fe(II) or Ru(II) ion and
   4,4-bis(2,2:6,2-terpyridinyl)phenyl-triphenylamine (L-TPA) as a
   redox-active ligand. The polymers had high solubility in methanol, and
   the polymer solutions showed dark brown (polyFe-N) or orange-red
   (polyRu-N) coloration. UV-vis spectra of the polymers displayed a strong
   metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) absorption in the visible region.
   Cyclic voltammograms of the polymer films exhibited two pairs of
   reversible redox waves. The first redox at similar to 0.5 V versus
   Ag/Ag+ was assigned to the redox in the triphenylamine (TPA) moiety of
   L-TPA, and the second redox at 0.8 V versus Ag/Ag+ (polyFe-N) or 0.9 V
   versus Ag/Ag+ (polyRu-N) was given to the redox of Fe(II)/(III) or
   Ru(II)/(III), respectively. Upon applying a positive potential of more
   than 0.5 V versus Ag/Ag+ to the polymer films, a new absorption at
   similar to 820 nm in the near-infrared (NIR) region appeared with wide
   tailing to the longer wavelength. It is considered that the new
   absorption in the NIR region is caused by the polaron band of the
   oxidized ligand in the polymers. When the applied potential was
   increased to 1.0 V versus Ag/Ag+ (polyFe-N) or 1.1 V versus Ag/Ag+
   (polyRu-N), the maximum wavelength of the new absorption in the NIR
   region shifted to 885-900 nm and the absorbance was further enhanced
   with disappearance of the MLCT absorption. Eventually, the original
   colors of the polymers were faint to light green. This visible-to-NIR
   electrochromism was reversible, and maximum optical contrast (Delta T)
   reached 52\% in the visible region and 80\% in the NIR region. A
   prototype solid-state device with the polymer was fabricated for
   practical utilization, exhibiting excellent cycle stability of >4000
   cycles with maintaining high optical contrast from the visible-to-NIR
   range.}},

Title = {{Pre-trained deep learning for hot-mix asphalt dynamic modulus prediction
   with laboratory effort reduction}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{265}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{Evaluating the hot mix asphalt (HMA) expected performance is one of the
   significant aspects of highways research. Dynamic modulus (E{*})
   presents itself as a fundamental mechanistic property that is one of the
   primary inputs for mechanistic-empirical models for pavements design.
   Unfortunately, E{*} testing is an expensive and complicated task that
   requires advanced testing equipment. Moreover, a significant source of
   difficulty in E{*} modeling is that many of the factors of variation in
   the HMA mixture components and testing conditions significantly
   influence the predicted values. For each laboratory practice, a vast
   num-ber of mixes are required to estimate the E{*} accurately. This
   study aims to extend the knowledge/practice of other laboratories to a
   target one in order to reduce the laboratory effort required for E{*}
   determination while attaining accurate E{*} prediction. Therefore, the
   transfer learning solution using deep learning (DL) technology is
   adopted for the problem. By transfer learning, instead of starting the
   learning process from scratch, previous learnings that have been gained
   when solving a similar problem is used. A deep convolution neural
   networks (DCNNs) technique, which incorporates a stack of six
   convolution blocks, is newly adapted for that purpose. Pre-trained DCNNs
   are constructed using a large data set that comes from different sources
   to constitute cumulative learning. The constructed pre-trained DCNNs aim
   to dramatically reduce the effort elsewhere (target lab) when it comes
   to the E{*} prediction problem. Then, a laboratory effort reduction
   justification is investigated through fine toning the constructed
   pre-trained DCNNs using a limited amount of the target lab data. The
   performance of the proposed DCNNs is evaluated using rep-resentative
   statistical performance indicators and compared with well-known
   predictive models (e.g., g based Witczak 1-37A, G,d-based Witczak 1-40D
   and G-based Hirsch models). The proposed methodology proves itself as an
   excellent tool for the E{*} prediction compared with the other models.
   Moreover, it could preserve its accurate performance with less data
   input using the transferred learning from the previous phase of the
   solution. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Effect of microwave heating on interlayer bonding and buildability of
   geopolymer 3D concrete printing}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{265}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{The emerging concept of 3D concrete printing (3DCP) by the laminate
   stacking of layers without formwork has major issues of poor interlayer
   bond adhesion and inadequate buildability of printed layers. This paper
   explores microwave heating technique as a set-on-demand method to
   increase the structuration rate of geopolymer concrete for 3DCP
   applications. The microwave heating was applied just before the
   placement of layers (i.e. at the nozzle head) and the effect of heating
   duration on the interlayer bond strength and buildability were assessed.
   Moreover, the loss of surface and bulk moisture and the bond strength
   enhancing mechanism were also investigated. The results demonstrated
   that the optimum microwaving duration of 10 s has increased the
   interlayer bond strength by 132\%. The interlayer temperature and
   surface moisture loss has shown an increasing trend with the heating
   duration. Despite the increased surface moisture loss with microwave
   heating, the observed increment in interlayer bond strength (for up to
   10 s of heating) was due to the acceleration in polycondensation
   reaction between the filaments having adequate stiffness for maximum
   mechanical interlocking with minimum deformation after stacking. On the
   other hand, the buildability of printed filaments, as measured from the
   rate of particle re-flocculation and structuration, has showed a major
   improvement. Findings from this study propose incorporating ``set-on
   demand{''} technique using electromagnetic radiations in construction 3D
   printing. This initiates a new era of print heads, designed to solve
   problems faced by current concrete printing industry. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In an attempt to achieve Sustainable Development Goals numbers one and
   two, eggshell meal was incorporated into layers diets to replace bone
   meal. Seventy-two point of lay birds were utilized in a nine-week
   experiment. Four experimental diets were formulated consisting of graded
   levels of bone meal (BM) and egg shell meal (ESM) which were coded as;
   T-1 (3\%BM: 0\%ESM), T-2 (2\%BM: 1\%ESM), T-3 (1\%BM: 2\%ESM), and T-4
   (0\%BM: 3\% ESM). Three replicates with six birds per replicate in a
   completely randomized design were used. Total egg weight, average egg
   weight, egg mass and feed conversion were significantly affected (P <
   0.05) by the inclusion of ESM and BM. Birds on T-4 recorded the
   significantly highest values for these parameters. Yolk width, albumen
   weight, egg weight and eggshell weight significantly (P < 0.05)
   increased with an increase in ESM, with eggs obtained from T-4 having
   the highest values. From this study, complete replacement of bone meal
   with eggshell meal in the diet of layers, i.e. T-4, gave the overall
   best results. It is recommended that farmers replace bone meal with egg
   shell meal as a major source of dietary calcium and phosphorus for
   laying birds.}},

Title = {{Characterization of thermal properties of bituminous mastic containing
   different fillers to be used in the cool pavement}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{265}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{The cool pavement with the function of oriented heat conduction was
   designed to improve its deformation resistance and decrease the heat
   island effect. Lots of research had been performed on the thermal
   properties of asphalt mixture in the cool pavement, but less of them
   focused on the mastic which played a vital role in the heat conduction.
   In this study, the normal filler, the cenospheres and the graphite were
   adopted to prepare the mastic samples. The normal filler was made of the
   limestone, and the cenospheres were obtained during coal-burning process
   in coal-fired power plants. The thermal conductivity analyzer was used
   to investigate the thermal properties of mastic. The scanning electron
   microscopy was employed to observe the morphological characteristics of
   different fillers. Dynamic shear rheometer was adopted to evaluate the
   rheological properties of the mastic as a function of temperature.
   Bruggeman's model and the finite element method were used to analyze the
   mechanism of thermal transmission of mastic. Based on the results, the
   mastic with the ratio of binder:normal filler:ceno spheres = 1:0.5:0.5
   by weight was recommended to be applied on the top layer of the cool
   pavement to improve its thermal insulation, and the one with the ratio
   of binder:graphite = 1:1 was recommended in its sub-layer to improve its
   thermal transmission and rutting resistance. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Emergence of the novel pathogenic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and its rapid
   pandemic spread presents challenges that demand immediate attention.
   Here, we describe the development of a semi-quantitative high-content
   microscopy-based assay for detection of three major classes (IgG, IgA,
   and IgM) of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in human samples. The
   possibility to detect antibodies against the entire viral proteome
   together with a robust semi-automated image analysis workflow resulted
   in specific, sensitive and unbiased assay that complements the portfolio
   of SARS-CoV-2 serological assays. Sensitive, specific and quantitative
   serological assays are urgently needed for a better understanding of
   humoral immune response against the virus as a basis for developing
   public health strategies to control viral spread. The procedure
   described here has been used for clinical studies and provides a general
   framework for the application of quantitative high-throughput microscopy
   to rapidly develop serological assays for emerging virus infections.}},

Title = {{Impact of managerial coaching skills on employee commitment: the role of
   personal learning}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   Managerial coaching has been popularized as a way of motivating,
   developing and retaining employees in organizations. Yet, there has been
   a lack of empirical studies to examine the linkage between managerial
   coaching and its potential impact on employees. This study aims to
   investigate the interrelationships among managerial coaching, employees'
   personal learning and organizational commitment. This study also
   attempts to revise an existing instrument for measuring coaching skills
   in organizations created by McLean et al. (2005) to assess managers'
   coaching skills.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Data analyzes were based on 187 employees of a top global technology
   organization headquartered in the USA. The existing instrument for
   measuring coaching skills was revised and confirmed through a series of
   efforts including expert reviews, pilot tests and assessing its
   reliability and validity. Structural equation modeling was used to
   examine the relationships among managerial coaching skills and
   employees' personal learning and organizational commitment.
   Findings
   This study identified five dimensions of managerial coaching skills and
   validated the revised instrument measuring coaching skills in
   organizations. It also demonstrated that managers' utilization of
   managerial coaching skills had a direct effect on employees' learning
   and organizational commitment and impacted employees' organizational
   commitment through personal learning.
   Originality/value
   This study examined the interrelationships among managerial coaching and
   employees' personal learning and organizational commitment in
   organizations. In doing so, this study unveiled the process of how
   managers' coaching affects employees' development and attitudes at work.
   This study also identified five coaching skills as a tool to assess the
   level of managerial coaching.}},

Title = {{Generalized objects in the system with dispersed knowledge}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{162}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{The inference process based on a set of local decision tables is
   considered in the article. Determining global decisions in such a
   situation is a complex and time-consuming task. The aim of the presented
   approach is to simplify this process by significantly reducing the size
   of local decision tables and, at the same time, maintaining the quality
   of decisions made. The research objective is the application of
   generalized objects with respect to the indiscernibility relation. When
   we use the generalized objects only the relevant and consistent
   knowledge remains in tables. In addition, the use of generalized objects
   for local tables results in a significant reduction in the number of
   objects in the tables. Such a change has a huge impact on the system's
   construction for dispersed data.
   The paper introduces a definition of the generalized objects that are
   suitable for quantitative data. In addition, a definition of the
   generalized objects generated with the accuracy expressed by the
   parameter, which are appropriate for qualitative data, is given.
   It was experimentally tested that the use of generalized objects
   significantly reduces the number of objects in local tables, up to 80\%
   or even 90\% percent of the original table. In addition, it was shown
   that the use of generalized objects for local tables with large number
   of attributes gives comparable quality of classification to the
   dispersed system using full objects. Moreover, it was depicted that the
   quality of classification obtained for such data and the dispersed
   system with the generalized objects is better than the quality that are
   obtained for full objects without using the dispersed system. (C) 2020

Title = {{A retrospective epidemiological study of paediatric femoral fractures}},
Journal = {{SWISS MEDICAL WEEKLY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{150}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Femoral fracture is a significant major trauma in children
   and adolescents, sometimes resulting in serious complications. This
   study aimed to determine the epidemiology of femoral fractures and to
   define associated injuries and mortality incidence in a pediatric
   population below 16 years old.
   METHODS: The medical records of all patients with a femoral fracture
   treated in our hospital from 1997-2016 were reviewed retrospectively.
   Age, gender, mechanism of the trauma, month and season of fracture
   occurrence, fracture type, associated injuries, and mortality data were
   collected. Patients were divided into four age groups and compared.
   RESULTS: The study included 348 children with 353 femoral fractures. The
   mean annual prevalence of femoral fracture during the study period was
   22.7 per 100,000 children. Except for children less than 1 year old,
   most fractures occurred in male patients (69\%), with a maleto-female
   ratio of 2.2:1. Road accidents were the most common mechanism at all
   ages. Femoral fractures were mainly due to low-energy trauma in neonates
   and infants, to road accidents and low-energy trauma in preschool
   children, to sports accidents in school-age children, and to road
   traffic accidents in teenagers. February was the month with the most
   occurrences of femoral fractures. Winter was the peak season for femoral
   fractures in children aged <1 year and 6-11 years (37.8\% and 46.4\% of
   fractures respectively), whereas autumn was the most common season
   (29.5\%) for preschool children and spring (31.1\%) the most common in
   the teenagers group. Diaphyseal fractures were the most commonly
   reported lesions in all four age groups, representing 72.3\% of all
   fractures. Only 18 fractures were open (5.1\%). Eighty-eight patients
   (25.3\%) presented with associated injuries at admission, 12 presented
   with Waddell's triad of injuries, and the mortality rate was calculated
   to be 1.1\% (four cases).
   CONCLUSION: The circumstances of injury and the seasonality of femoral
   fractures differed significantly depending on the children's ages.
   Moreover, the morbidity of femoral fractures in children was closely
   correlated with associated injuries. (Level of evidence: Level III)}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, videos are simply captured and viral in little time, and video
   editing has turn out to be more convenient with editing software.
   Therefore, the validity of the videos becomes more important. Inter
   frame video counterfeiting is the most common type of video spoofing
   method that is difficult to detect with the naked eye. So far, it has
   been suggested that some algorithms detect Inter frame counterfeits
   based on artisanal characteristics, but the accuracy and processing
   speed of these algorithms remain a challenge. This article proposes
   Markov based approach to detecting this particular object. First, the
   unique Markov characteristics in the DCT domain are extended to capture
   not only the inter-block correlation but also the intra-block
   association among the block DCT coefficients. after that, supplementary
   features are built in the DWT domain to distinguish three types of
   dependencies between the wavelet coefficients across positions, scales,
   and orientations. After that, we will introduce a video tampering
   detection method to detect Inter frame video tampering based on
   Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models by retraining the accessible
   CNN model trained on the ImageNet dataset. The proposed method is based
   on state-of-the-art CNN models, which are retrained to exploit the
   spatio-temporal relations in a video to strongly detect Inter frame
   fakes and we have also proposed a confidence score instead of the score
   of raw output based on these networks, to increase the precision of the
   proposed method. Through the experiments, the detection precision of the
   proposed method is 99.16\%. This result has shown that the planned
   method has considerably higher efficiency and precision than other
   existing methods.}},

Abstract = {{Sint Eustatius (Statia) is a 21 lun 2 island situated in the
   northeastern Caribbean Sea. The most recent published sources of
   information on that island's marine fish fauna is in two
   non-governmental organization reports from 2015-17 related to the
   formation of a marine reserve. The species-list in the 2017 report was
   based on field research in 2013-15 using SCUBA diving surveys, shallow
   ``baited underwater video surveys{''} (BRUVS), and data from fishery
   surveys and scientific collections over the preceding century. That
   checklist comprised 304 species of shallow (mostly) and deep-water
   fishes. In 2017 the Smithsonian Deep Reef Observation Project surveyed
   deep-reef fishes at Statia using the crewed submersible Curasub. That
   effort recorded 120 species, including 59 new occurrences records. In
   March-May 2020, two experienced citizen scientists completed 62 SCUBA
   dives there and recorded 244 shallow species, 40 of them new records for
   Statia. The 2017-2020 research effort increased the number of species
   known from the island by 33.6\% to 406. Here we present an updated
   catalog of that marine fish fauna, including voucher photographs of 280
   species recorded there in 2017 and 2020. The Statia reef-fish fauna
   likely is incompletely documented as it has few small, shallow,
   cryptobenthic species, which are a major component of the regional
   fauna. A lack of targeted sampling is probably the major factor
   explaining that deficit, although a limited range of benthic marine
   habitats may also be contributing.}},

   under inflammatory conditions}},
Journal = {{CELL COMMUNICATION AND SIGNALING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{18}},

Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundMacrophages adapt to microenvironments, and change metabolic
   status and functions to regulate inflammation and/or maintain
   homeostasis. In joint cavities, synovial macrophages (SM) and synovial
   fibroblasts (SF) maintain homeostasis. However, under inflammatory
   conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), crosstalk between SM and
   SF remains largely unclear.MethodsImmunofluorescent staining was
   performed to identify localization of SM and SF in synovium of collagen
   antibody induced arthritis (CAIA) model mice and normal mice. Murine
   arthritis tissue-derived SM (ADSM), arthritis tissue-derived SF (ADSF)
   and normal tissue-derived SF (NDSF) were isolated and the purity of
   isolated cells was examined by RT-qPCR and flow cytometry analysis.
   RNA-seq was conducted to reveal gene expression profile in ADSM, NDSF
   and ADSF. Cellular metabolic status and expression levels of metabolic
   genes and inflammatory genes were analyzed in ADSM treated with
   ADSM-conditioned medium (ADSM-CM), NDSF-CM and ADSF-CM. ResultsSM and SF
   were dispersed in murine hyperplastic synovium. Isolations of ADSM, NDSF
   and ADSF to analyze the crosstalk were successful with high purity. From
   gene expression profiles by RNA-seq, we focused on secretory factors in
   ADSF-CM, which can affect metabolism and inflammatory activity of ADSM.
   ADSM exposed to ADSF-CM showed significantly upregulated glycolysis and
   mitochondrial respiration as well as glucose and glutamine uptake
   relative to ADSM exposed to ADSM-CM and NDSF-CM. Furthermore, mRNA
   expression levels of metabolic genes, such as Slc2a1, Slc1a5, CD36,
   Pfkfb1, Pfkfb3 and Irg1, were significantly upregulated in ADSM treated
   with ADSF-CM. Inflammation marker genes, including Nos2, Tnf, Il-1b and
   CD86, and the anti-inflammatory marker gene, Il-10, were also
   substantially upregulated by ADSF-CM. On the other hand, NDSF-CM did not
   affect metabolism and gene expression in ADSM.ConclusionsThese findings
   suggest that crosstalk between SM and SF under inflammatory conditions
   can induce metabolic reprogramming and extend SM viability that together
   can contribute to chronic inflammation in RA}},

Title = {{In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic: economic insecurity and coping
   strategies of Italian households}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL POLICY}},
Abstract = {{Purpose This paper offers a contribution to the authors' understanding
   of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on living conditions of Italian
   households. A large part of the research, analysis, comments focused on
   the relation between the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and income of
   the Italian households does not capture the extent of the current
   changes. The focus on the highly differentiated impacts of the pandemic
   on three core dimensions of social integration (the sphere of work, that
   of welfare and that of the family) could help the authors to grasp the
   current transformations. Design/methodology/approach The research draws
   on Castel's distinction between three ``zones{''} of post-Fordist
   employment societies with the aim to identify the processes and the
   conditions that carry individuals from one ``zones{''} to the other.
   Theoretical considerations are supported by the findings of several
   qualitative and quantitative research carried out during the pandemic
   mainly by government agencies and international organizations as OECD
   and WHO. The analysis of healthcare expenditure, labour market and
   economic conditions of households is based on data of system of health
   accounts - SHA and from consumer studies undertaken by the Italian
   National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT). The data on the financial
   situation and expectations of households during the crisis used in the
   article were drawn from special surveys carried out by the Bank of
   Italy. Findings What the authors observe in Italian society is not a
   collapse of the three pillars of social and system integration of
   contemporary societies: work, family and welfare. The COVID-19 pandemic
   has reversed two social and institutional trends, that in last two
   decades had damaged these spheres of life and that seemed relentless.
   First, what has been reversed are: the progressive privatization of
   welfare and the enhancement of the politics of retrenchment; second,
   values and styles of life, radical processes of individualization, that
   undermined mutual relations of support and care, and households' ability
   to cope with old and new risks. At the same time, the pandemic is
   radicalizing the long-lasting tendency towards job insecurity, a high
   incidence of low-paid workers and a high proportion of undeclared work.
   The highly differentiated impacts of the pandemic on these three spheres
   of life are creating a wider plurality of living conditions and risks.
   Social implications The findings suggest that what the authors need is
   to reopen the debate on welfare priorities, programmes and areas of
   intervention, on public-private relationship that have been established
   in many sectors of welfare in the last decades in many European
   countries. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance welfare
   programmes capable of recognising the autonomous capacities of the
   family and informal relations to produce well-being, to cope with the
   crisis and to produce supportive relationships. Originality/value The
   pandemic highlighted that a progressive reduction of expenditure and
   politics of retrenchment produced welfare not able to face the needs of
   a large part of households. The pandemic highlighted that the changes
   that have taken place in the sphere of work, welfare and of the family
   in the last years have produced less and less governable effects.}},

Title = {{Effects of Ni incorporation on the reactivity and stability of
   hausmannite (Mn3O4): Environmental implications for Mn, Ni, and As
   solubility and cycling}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{558}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{Trace metal structural impurities are common in Mn (II/III) oxides, yet
   their effects on the oxides' reactivity and stability have not been
   experimentally assessed. The present investigation quantifies such
   effects for the first time by measuring the extent of mineral
   dissolution of pristine and Ni-substituted hausmannite (MnIIMnIII2 O4)
   (at 1 and 2 wt\% Ni) in 8-h batch reactions at pH 5 with/without
   arsenite (As(III)). Ni substitution occurred at Mn(III) octahedral
   sites, causing noticeable structural modification in lattice parameters
   with a decrease in Jahn-Teller distortion, particularly at 2 wt\%. In
   both acidic and reductive dissolution (with As(III)), the Ni-substituted
   hausmannite exhibited enhanced Mn release relative to the pristine
   mineral, with concurrent release of structural Ni increasing with
   substitution percentage. When As(V) release was normalized by surface
   area, Ni-substituted hausmannite showed a higher As(III) oxidation
   percentage than the pristine phase. Further, higher ratios of Mn
   (II):As(V) were observed in Ni-substituted hausmannite. As K-edge X-ray
   absorption spectroscopy and attenuated total reflectance-Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy analyses indicated that As(III)
   oxidation lead to the formation of binuclear bidentate As(V) surface
   complexes. Enhanced reactivity of Ni-substituted hausmannite may be
   attributed to lowered mineral stability, which promotes accelerated
   mineral dissolution and increased structural Mn release, resulting in
   formation/exposure of highly reactive sites. Thus, structural impurities
   dictate the properties, reactivity, and stability of the Mn(II/III)
   oxides, affecting the level of dissolution and the extent of redox
   reactions, which together impact the fate and cycling of transition
   metals and metalloids in surface environments.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a kind of novel Mn3O4 embedded 3D N/P-codoped carbon
   sheets/carbon foams (Mn3O4-NPCN/CF) composites is directly prepared by
   high-temperature pyrolysis. The Mn3O4-NPCN/CF with highly opened porous
   structure has outstanding advantages, such as providing abundant
   channels for ion fast transport, increasing electrolyte permeation rate,
   ensuring effective contact between electrode and electrolyte, and
   enhancing electron conduction. The nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)
   heteroatoms enhance the surface wettability of the Mn3O4-NPCN/CF
   electrode and widen the voltage window. Mn3O4 embedded in the
   N/P-codoped carbon sheet stably provides pseudocapacitance.
   Consequently, the Mn3O4-NPCN/CF electrode displays a high specific
   capacitance of 519 F g(-1) and cycle stability (96\% after 5000 cycles)
   in 6 M KOH electrolyte. Moreover, the Mn3O4-NPCN/CF-based
   all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitors still show prominent
   capacitance value of 207 F g(-1) and 141 F g(-1) in polyvinylalcohol/
   KOH and polyvinylalcohol/Na2SO4 gel electrolyte, respectively.
   Significantly, the all solid-state symmetric supercapacitors retain
   above 90\% capacitance after 500 mechanical bending and wide-temperature
   range cycles (-20 to 80 SC). This work provides a facile, low-cost and
   environmental friendliness process to prepare high-performance electrode
   materials in energy storage field. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have attracted all-time attention
   because of their supernormal high energy density and low cost, whereas
   they are still plagued by the severe polysulfide shuttling and sluggish
   sulfur redox reaction kinetics. Moreover, poor sulfur electrochemical
   utilization and rapid capacity degradation are top concerns in the
   high-loading Li-S batteries, which severely hinder their practical
   applications. Herein, a completely novel porous nanoneedle array NiCo2S4
   electrocatalyst grown on a nitrogen-sulfur-doped carbon cloth (NSCC)
   (NiCo2S4@NSCC) is constructed as a 3D self-supported sulfur host for
   high-loading Li-S batteries, in which the highest sulfur loading reaches
   4.9 mg cm(-2). The as-prepared NiCo2S4@NSCC with a typical sulfur
   loading of around 2.0 mg cm(-2) provides a high discharge capacity of
   1223 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C and long-term cycle stability with a low
   capacity decay of 0.046\% per cycle over 500 cycles at 1 C.
   Additionally, NiCo2S4@NSCC/S with a high sulfur loading of 4.9 mg cm(-2)
   delivers an excellent reversible areal capacity of 4.4 mA h cm(-2) g
   over 50 cycles. Noting that such superior electrochemical performance of
   NiCo2S4@NSCC/S with high-loading sulfur is mainly attributed to high
   electronic conductivity and the abundant porous structure of NSCC to
   transport electrons and ions fastly and accommodate sulfur as well as
   robust absorbability and the outstanding catalytic effect of NiCo2S4 to
   accelerate the capture and conversion of the polysulfide intermediate.
   Predictably, this work can provide a guideline to efficiently and
   rationally design the structure of metal-based compounds with catalytic
   functions for various applications.}},

Journal = {{FOOD CHEMISTRY-X}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{Biofortified rice with high Zn concentration could reduce Zn deficiency
   in South Asia. This population frequently parboils rice. True retention
   (TR) of Zn, Fe and phytic acid after parboiling and milling was
   evaluated in biofortified and non-biofortified rice. TR in milled
   non-parboiled rice was 63.8-89.6\% for Zn, 21.1-44.5\% for Fe and
   16.4-40.3\% for phytic acid, whereas in milled parboiled rice TR was
   49.8-72.2\% for Zn, 23.4-36.7\% for Fe and 22.0-33.3\% for phytic acid.
   Milled parboiled rice resulted in lower Zn TR compared to milled
   non-parboiled. These results suggest that Zn moves from the inner
   endosperm towards the outer layers during parboiling, regardless of
   initial Zn concentration, consequently, once milled, the potential
   impact of Zn intake on Zn deficiency from parboiled rice is less than
   non-parboiled rice. Despite Zn losses during processing, biofortified
   rice could provide over 50\% of the Zn EAR for children.}},

Title = {{Pooled prevalence and determinants of skilled birth attendant delivery
   in East Africa countries: a multilevel analysis of Demographic and
   Health Surveys}},
Journal = {{ITALIAN JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{46}},

Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{IntroductionSkilled health professional assisted delivery is an
   effective strategy to reduce maternal and newborn mortality. Skilled
   assistant delivery can prevent about 16-33\% of maternal and newborn
   mortality. Despite the commitments of the government to assure home free
   delivery, majority of the births in Sub-Saharan Africa are attended by
   traditional birth attendants. As to our search of the literature, there
   is limited evidence on the prevalence and determinants of skilled
   delivery in East African countries. Therefore, this study aimed to
   estimate the pooled prevalence and determinants of skilled birth
   attendant delivery in East Africa Countries.MethodsPooled analysis was
   done based on Demographic and Health Surveys conducted in the 12 East
   African countries from 2008 to 2017. A total weighted sample of 141,483
   women who gave birth during the study period was included in the study.
   The pooled prevalence of skilled birth attendance was estimated using
   STATA version 14. Intra-class Correlation Coefficient, Median Odds
   Ratio, Proportional Change in Variance, and deviance were used for model
   fitness and comparison. The multilevel multivariable logistic regression
   model was fitted to identify determinants of skilled birth attendance in
   the region. Adjusted Odds Ratio with its 95\% Confidence Interval was
   used to declare significant determinants of skilled birth
   attendants.ResultsThe pooled prevalence of skilled birth attendant in
   East African countries were 67.18\% (95\% CI:66.98, 67.38) with highest
   skilled birth attendant in Rwanda (90.68\%) and the lowest skilled birth
   attendant in Tanzania (11.91\%). In the Multilevel multivariable
   logistic regression model; age 15-24 (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR)=1.14,
   95\%CI:1.09, 1.18), age 25-49(AOR=1.16, 95\%CI:1.10,1.23), primary women
   education (AOR=1.57, 95\%CI:1.51,1.63), secondary and above women
   education (AOR=2.85, 95\%CI:1.73,3.01), primary husband education
   (AOR=1.11, 95\%CI=1.07,1.15), secondary and above husband education
   (AOR=1.46, 95\%CI=1.40,1.53), middle wealth index (AOR=1.43,
   95\%CI=1.38,1.49),rich wealth index (AOR=2.38, 95\%CI=2.28,2.48), had
   ANC visit (AOR=1.68, 95\%CI=1.62,1.73),multiple gestation (AOR=2.06,
   95\%CI=1.90,2.25), parity 2-4(AOR=0.65, 95\%CI=0.61,0.69), parity
   5+(AOR=0.44, 95\%CI=0.41,0.47), accessing health care not big problem
   (AOR=1.32, 95\%CI=1.28,1.36), residence (AOR=0.43, 95\%CI=0.41,0.45) and
   being Burundi resident (AOR=0.77, 95\%CI=0.70,0.85) were significantly
   associated with skilled assisted delivery.ConclusionSkilled birth
   attendance at birth in the East Africa countries was low. Maternal age,
   women and husband education, wealth index, antenatal care visit,
   multiple gestations, parity, accessing health care, residence, and
   living countries were major determinants of skilled attendant delivery.
   Strategies to increase the accessibility and availability of healthcare
   services, and financial support that targets mothers from poor
   households and rural residents to use health services will be
   beneficial. Health education targeting mothers and their partner with no
   education are vital to increasing their awareness about the importance
   of skilled birth attendance at birth.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INTERNET COMMERCE}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of electronic banking
   service quality (SQ) on customer satisfaction (CS) and customer loyalty
   (CL). It also sought to compare differences between SQ delivery of
   domestic and foreign origin banks operating in the Greater Accra Region
   of Ghana. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to investigate
   the relationships between the dimensions of electronic banking SQ, CS
   and CL. In addition, the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was also conducted
   to establish the differences in electronic banking SQ between local
   banks and foreign banks. The results show that, all four dimensions of
   SQ, namely convenience, ease of use, accessibility, and affordability
   were found to be significant positive drivers of CS. The study also
   found that CS fully mediates the relationship between all four
   electronic banking SQ dimensions and CL. Additionally, the study reports
   that on average foreign origin banks deliver better electronic banking
   SQ to their customers than domestic banks. Domestic banks should invest
   more in improving electronic banking SQ to drive CS, CL and ultimately
   firm performance. The findings of this study reinforce literature on the
   positive influence of SQ on CS and CL.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrilase (NLase) was covalently immobilized on modified Relizyme
   supports or adsorbed on montmorillonite K-10 or entrapped in polyvinyl
   alcohol hydrogel. Although 80-90\% of initial loaded protein was
   immobilized, however, unsatisfactory activity recoveries was obtained in
   both covalent immobilization and adsorption studies. Entrapping NLase in
   polyvinyl alcohol allowed us to obtain an immobilized NLase with 80\%
   activity recovery and 100\% initial protein recovery. The
   characterization studies showed that the free and entrapped NLase
   samples had both maximum activity at pH 7.5 and 30 degrees C. The free
   nitrilase completely lost its initial activity at 30 degrees C after 24
   h pre-incubation. However, the entrapped NLase retained 60\% of its
   initial activity under the same conditions. Acrylonitrile with a initial
   concentration of 0.1 M was all converted to acrylic acid by entrapped
   NLase in 30 min whereas the same yield was achieved by soluble enzyme in
   60 min. The entrapped NLase retained 84\% of its initial activity after
   15 reuses for the hydrolysis of acrylonitrile. These results show that
   the entrapped NLase can be of great interest as a biocatalyst to
   synthesize acrylic acid under mild reaction conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The utility of gastric biopsy for diagnosing immunoglobulin
   (Ig)G4-related gastrointestinal disease (IgG4-GID) remains unclear.
   Bottom-heavy plasmacytosis (BHP) is a distinct feature of IgG4-GID. To
   clarify the feasibility of using gastric biopsies to diagnose BHP in
   IgG4-GID, we analyzed the histological features and immunostaining of
   gastric biopsy specimens from 31 known IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD)
   patients and we assessed the presence of BHP in 1696 consecutive routine
   gastric biopsies. Cases with both >10 IgG4-positive plasma cells per
   high-power field and an IgG4/IgG-positive ratio >40\% were defined as
   IgG4-high. Ten of the 31 IgG4-RD patients were concluded to have
   IgG4-GID, in which IgG4-positive plasma cells were notably detected at
   the deeper part of the mucosa. Six cases displayed BHP whereas the
   remaining four cases showed transmural infiltration with concomitant
   Helicobacter pylori-associated gastritis. In addition to BHP, we
   identified two unique histologic features for IgG4-GID: plasmacytic
   aggregation in the muscularis mucosae and permeative plasmacytic
   infiltration between fundic glands in the non-atrophic mucosa. Six of
   the routine cases (0.35\%) displayed BHP, including a case with IgG4-RD.
   IgG4-GID can be suspected by the presence of gastric biopsy specimens
   with characteristic histological features. Such cases are recommended to
   undergo further examinations to determine whether IgG4-RD is present.}},

Abstract = {{Worldwide, adherence to national guidelines for physical activity (PA),
   and fruit and vegetable consumption is recommended to promote health and
   reduce the risk for (chronic) disease. This study reports on the
   effectiveness of various social-cognitive interventions to improve
   adherence to guidelines and the revealed adherence predictors.
   Participants (n = 1,629), aged 45-70 years, randomly selected and
   recruited in 2005-2006 from 23 Dutch general practices, were randomized
   (centralized stratified allocation) to four groups to receive a 12-month
   lifestyle intervention targeting guideline adherence for PA and fruit
   and vegetable consumption. Study groups received either four
   computer-tailored print communication (TPC) letters (n = 405), four
   telephone motivational interviewing (TMI) sessions (n = 407), a combined
   intervention (two TPC letters and two TMI sessions, n = 408), or no
   intervention (control group, n = 409). After the baseline assessment,
   all parties were aware of the treatment groups. Outcomes were measured
   with self-report postal questionnaires at baseline, 25, 47 and 73 weeks.
   For PA, all three interventions were associated with better guideline
   adherence than no intervention. Odds ratios for TPC, TMI and the
   combined intervention were 1.82 (95\% CI 1.31; 2.54), 1.57 (95\% CI
   1.13; 2.18), and 2.08 (95\% CI 1.50; 2.88), respectively. No pedometer
   effects were found. For fruit and vegetable consumption, TPC seemed
   superior to those in the other groups. Odd ratio for fruit and vegetable
   consumption were 1.78 (95\% CI 1.32; 2.41) and 1.73 (95\% CI 1.28;
   2.33), respectively. For each behaviour, adherence was predicted by
   self-efficacy expectations, habit strength and stages of change, whereas
   sex, awareness and the number of action plans predicted guideline
   adherence for fruit and vegetable intake. The season predicted the
   guideline adherence for PA and fruit consumption. The odds ratios
   revealed were equivalent to modest effects sizes, although they were
   larger than those reported in systematic reviews. This study indicated
   that less resource intensive interventions might have the potential for
   a large public health impact when widely implemented. The strengths of
   this study were the participation of lower educated adults and
   evaluation of maintenance effects. (Trial NL1035, 2007-09-06).}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the unsteady flow of Al2O3-Cu/water hybrid
   nanofluid on a stagnation point of a permeable rigid surface. The
   similarity equations are obtained using similarity variables and then
   solved using the bvp4c solver. The outcomes show that dual solutions
   exist for the negative unsteadiness and some mass flux parameters.
   Besides, the heat transfer rate is intensified with the hybrid
   nanoparticles. Moreover, the increasing of the mass flux parameter tends
   to increase the heat transfer rate and the skin friction on the surface.
   Also, the reduction of the skin friction coefficient is observed, and a
   higher heat transfer rate is achieved for smaller values of the
   unsteadiness parameter. Finally, by a temporal stability analysis, it is
   found that the first solution is stable and reliable as time evolves.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) is involved in lipid metabolism
   and inflammatory response in immune cells. However, the serum level of
   ACLY and its clinical relevance in sepsis is totally unknown.
   Methods: We conducted a prospective pilot study in patients with sepsis
   admitted to pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) from January 2018 to
   December 2018.
   Results: Higher levels of ACLY were detected in sera of pediatric
   patients with sepsis than that of healthy children. The area under the
   receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of ACLY for diagnosis of
   sepsis was 0.855 (95\% confidence interval {[}CI]: 0757-0.952), and an
   AUC of ACLY for predicting PICU mortality was 0.770 (95\% CI:
   0.626-0.915). ACLY levels <= 21 ng/ml on PICU admission predicted an
   unfavorable prognosis among patients with sepsis with a sensitivity of
   87.5\% and a specificity of 67.6\%. Moreover, serum ACLY levels were
   correlated to platelet count, IL-18 levels, and monocyte counts in
   pediatric patients with sepsis, implying the potential roles of ACLY in
   immunometabolic regulation in sepsis.
   Conclusions: ACLY is firstly identified in sera of patients with sepsis.
   Serum ACLY level is an additional diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in
   pediatric patients with sepsis.}},

Abstract = {{Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant hereditary
   neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive dystonia, chorea
   and cognitive or psychiatric disturbances. The leading cause is the
   Huntington gene mutation on the patient's chromosome 4 that produces a
   mutated protein. Recently, attention has focused on the relationship
   between microRNAs and Huntington's disease's pathogenesis. In
   Huntington's disease, microRNAs can interact with various transcription
   factors; dysregulated microRNAs may be associated with the Cytosine
   deoxynucleotide-Adenine ribonucleotides-Guanine ribonucleotide length
   and Huntington's disease's progression and severity. This study explores
   the role of microRNAs in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease
   through bioinformatics analysis. By analyzing data from the Gene
   Expression Omnibus database, we identified a total of 9 differentially
   expressed microRNA. Subsequently, target genes and long non-coding RNAs
   were predicted, and a comprehensive regulatory network centered on
   microRNA was constructed. The microRNA integrated regulatory network,
   Homo sapiens (hsa)-miR-144-3p, interacted with the largest number of
   long non-coding RNAs, including X-inactive specific transcript and
   taurine upregulated gene 1. The miRNAs, hsa-miR-10b-5p and
   hsa-miR-196a-5p, regulated most of the target genes, including class I
   homeobox and brain-derived neurotrophic factor genes. Additionally, 59
   Gene Ontology terms and eight enrichment pathways were identified by
   analyzing the target genes of hsa-miR-196a-5p and hsa-microRNA-10b-5p.
   In conclusion, hsa-miR-10b-5p and hsa-miR-196a-5p were significantly and
   differentially expressed in Huntington's disease, the long non-coding
   RNAs X-inactive specific transcript, taurine upregulated gene 1, and
   target genes such as homeobox or brain-derived neurotrophic factor may
   play critical roles in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease.}},

Title = {{Mechanical properties of a balsa wood veneer structural sandwich core
   material}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{265}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{Balsa wood is an appropriate core material for structural sandwich
   applications due to its high strength- and stiffness-to-weight ratios.
   However, the mechanical properties vary considerably owing to the
   inherent scattering of natural wood materials. One approach to reduce
   this scatter and tailor the mechanical properties according to specific
   application needs is to recompose the natural material into a veneered
   material consisting of veneer layers of different grain orientations,
   which are adhesively bonded together. The mechanical properties of such
   a veneered balsa wood, composed of alternating 0 degrees/90 degrees
   grain orientations, were investigated at ambient temperature according
   to corresponding standards. The properties were significantly influenced
   by the orthotropy on the material scale within one veneer layer and on
   the system scale within the assembled veneer layers. Standardized
   experimental set-ups and specimen geometries may produce artifacts such
   as buckling or strain hardening which deviate from the material behavior
   in real structures. The thin adhesive between the veneer layers did not
   negatively affect the mechanical behavior since failure occurred within
   the veneer layers and not in the interfaces. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The development of high-performance glucose sensors is an urgent need,
   especially for diabetes mellitus diagnosis. However, the glucose
   monitoring is conventionally operated in an invasive finger-prick manner
   and their noninvasive alternatives largely suffered from the relatively
   poor sensitivity, selectivity, and stability, resulted from the lack of
   robust and efficient catalysts. In this paper, we design a concave
   shaped nitrogen-doped carbon framework embellished with single Co site
   catalyst (Co SSC) by selectively controlling the etching rate on
   different facet of carbon substrate, which is beneficial to the
   diffusion and contact of analyte. The Co SSC prompts a significant
   improvement in the sensitivity of the solution gated graphene transistor
   (SGGT) devices, with three orders of magnitude better than those of SGGT
   devices without catalysts. Our findings expand the field of single site
   catalyst in the application of biosensors, diabetes diagnostics and
   personalized health-care monitoring. (c) 2020 Science China Press.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we generalize the Birnbaum-Saunders (BS) distribution by
   two ways. One is based on the mixture representation of BS distribution,
   and a flexible weight is adopted to describe the kurtosis of the
   distribution. The other way is based on the transformation property of
   BS distribution, and we incorporate a power parameter in the
   transformation to describe the skewness of the distribution. Then a
   four-parameter BS distribution including skewness and kurtosis
   parameters is induced by combining the two ways. The properties of these
   generalized BS distributions are investigated. Then, the expectation
   maximization (EM) algorithm is proposed to estimate the parameters. Real
   data analysis is performed to illustrate the superiority of the
   generalized BS distributions. Finally, some potential generalizations
   are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Angiotensin II (AngII), the effector peptide of the renin angiotensin
   system and has an important role in regulating cardiovascular
   hemodynamics and structure. AngII is an important biomarker for certain
   diseases that are associated with cardiovascular disorders, i.e.,
   influenza, SARS-CoV-2, tumors, hypertension, etc. However, AngII
   presents in blood in very low concentrations and they are not stable due
   to their reactivity, therefore spontaneous detection of AngII is a big
   challenge. In this study, AngII-imprinted spongy columns (AngII-misc)
   synthesized for AngII detection from human serum, and characterized by
   surface area measurements (BET), swelling tests, scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), FTIR studies. AngII binding studies were achieved from
   aqueous environment and maximum binding capacity was found as 0.667
   mg/g. It was calculated that the AngII-miscs recognized AngII 8.27 and
   14.25 times more selectively than competitor Angiotensin I and
   Vasopressin molecules. Newly produced AngII-misc binds 60.5 pg/g AngII
   from crude human serum selectively. It has a great potential for
   spontaneous detection of AngII from human serum for direct and critical
   measurements in serious diseases, that is, heart attacks, SARS-CoV-2,

Title = {{A verification of motivations for over-the-top binge and short viewing
   of audio-visual content}},
Journal = {{NEW REVIEW OF HYPERMEDIA AND MULTIMEDIA}},
Abstract = {{The current study purposes to verify the motivations for the consumption
   of audio-visual content through binge-viewing or short watching. It is
   grounded in the uses and gratification perspective to examine five
   distinct types of stimuli for binge-viewing and short watching:
   enjoyment, efficiency, information seeking, social interaction, and
   relaxation. Results of the analyses demonstrate that enjoyment and
   efficiency are positively associated with the tendency toward
   binge-viewing. However, the inclination toward short watching is
   correlated to enjoyment, efficiency, social interaction, and information
   seeking, and relaxation was not predictive of either inclination. The
   study also contemplated loneliness and addiction as moderating variables
   for binge-viewing and short watching behaviour. Structural equation
   modelling (SEM) was employed to validate the moderating effects of these
   two psychological states. The SEM results of the two-group analysis
   revealed that loneliness and addiction affected motivation and
   influenced attitudes toward binge-viewing and short watching. The
   present study is one of the first attempts to verify and compare the
   media viewing behaviours of binge-watching and short watching. Thus, it
   can contribute substantially to a more comprehensive scholarly
   understanding of over-the-top consumption of audio-visual content.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, multi-harmonic oscillation behaviour and stability
   problem in double-input buck/buck-boost inverter are investigated both
   theoretically and experimentally. First, the observer-pattern model is
   obtained by the local orthogonal and autonomous transformation in order
   to eliminate the time-variance effect from both fundamental component
   and the `hidden' second-harmonic in the double-input cascade system.
   Based on the proposed model, bifurcation analysis method is employed to
   reveal the underlying mechanism of the multi-harmonic oscillation
   behaviour and identify the dominant harmonics. It is shown that the
   occurrence of Hopf bifurcation results in the double-adding harmonic
   oscillation, and the interaction between the double-adding harmonic
   components and the `hidden' second harmonic component is also
   responsible for the multi-harmonic oscillation behaviour. Meanwhile, the
   occurrence of the multi-harmonic oscillations leads to the decrease of
   the system efficiency. For stability enhancement, the harmonic-stability
   sensitivity is presented to evaluate the influence of the key circuit
   parameters on the system stability quantitatively. In addition, the
   stability boundaries of the double-input inverter for these key
   parameters are provided to guide the system optimal design. Finally, the
   effectiveness of the above analysis is verified by those experimental
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Laser manufacturing is a promising method for the design and preparation
   of high value-added materials. When the laser acts on the polymer
   precursors, some wonderful phenomena will always occur and accompanied
   by the generation of new substances. Herein, we report a top-down
   approach for the direct preparation of orange-yellow dye that is similar
   to psittacofulvins from commercial polymer resins by laser writing.
   Conjugated double bonds and micro-rough structures are formed
   simultaneously on laser-irradiated polymer substrate surfaces. The
   typical polyconjugated structures of psittacofulvin dyes were confirmed
   by micro-Raman and Raman imaging results. Temperature-dependent Fourier
   transform infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy further
   demonstrated the formation mechanism of laser-induced psittacofulvins
   dyes based on the chemical composition. Further, optical microscopy,
   laser confocal microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy were carried
   out to characterize the physical morphologies of laser-irradiated
   polymer substrates. A unique advantage of preparing psittacofulvins dye
   using laser writing is its simple steps, and the dye can be converted
   directly from the appropriate precursor substrate. Interestingly, the
   laser-irradiated polymer substrate surface undergoes color change. This
   laser-induced color patterning is attractive due to the characteristics
   of high precision, flexibility, and maskless; any patterns can be easily
   designed and produced on the polymer at desired positions.}},

   adjusted at the same time, which reduces the impact of non-Newton atoms
   on the workpiece; The change rules of temperature and cutting stress
   under different rake angle and flank angle conditions are analysed, and
   the minimum cutting stress is obtained when the rake angle is 15
   degrees; By prefabricating a crack on the flank face, the change rule of
   the crack edge stress is studied. It is found that due to the occurrence
   of crack, the contact area between the tool and the workpiece is
   reduced, and there is obvious stress concentration at the edge of the
   crack.}},

Title = {{Numerical simulation on heat storage performance of backfill body based
   on tube-in-tube heat exchanger}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{265}},
Month = {{DEC 30}},
Abstract = {{Deep mines contain abundant geothermal energy. As a solid heat storage
   material, the backfill body near the surrounding rock and stope can
   continuously absorb heat. The phase change material (PCM) embedded in
   the tube-in-tube heat exchanger is more conducive to the accumulation of
   geothermal energy. In this paper, the backfill body with tube-in-tube
   heat exchanger is taken as the research object and its heat storage
   process is simulated by FLUENT. The influence of surrounding rock
   temperature, initial temperature of backfill body, airflow temperature
   and velocity in stope on the heat storage performance of backfill body
   is analyzed. The results show that adding PCM can increase the heat
   storage capacity and the average increment is 155.2 kJ within 10 h
   compared with ordinary backfill body. The total heat storage capacity
   always increases over time with an increment about 90\% occurring within
   5 h. This paper provides a theoretical basis for the study of the heat
   storage performance of the backfill body under different working
   conditions in mines, and also lays a foundation for the efficient
   accumulation of geothermal energy and the exploitation of deep
   geothermal energy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{BIOENGINEERING \& TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2021}},

Abstract = {{Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver injury is predominantly caused
   by free radicals, in which mitochondrial function of hepatocytes is
   impaired, accompanying with the production of ROS and decreased ATP
   energy supply in animals intoxicated with CCl4. Here we explored a novel
   therapeutic approach, mitochondrial transplantation therapy, for
   treating the liver injury. The results showed that mitochondria entered
   hepatocytes through macropinocytosis pathway, and thereby cell viability
   was recovered in a concentration-dependent manner. Mitochondrial therapy
   could increase ATP supply and reduce free radical damage. In liver
   injury model of mice, mitochondrial therapy significantly improved liver
   function and prevented tissue fibrogenesis. Transcriptomic data revealed
   that mitochondrial unfold protein response (UPRmt), a protective
   transcriptional response of mitochondria-to-nuclear retrograde
   signaling, would be triggered after mitochondrial administration. Then
   the anti-oxidant genes were up-regulated to scavenge free radicals. The
   mitochondrial function was rehabilitated through the transcriptional
   activation of respiratory chain enzyme and mitophage-associated genes.
   The protective response re-balanced the cellular homeostasis, and
   eventually enhanced stress resistance that is linked to cell survival.
   The efficacy of mitochondrial transplantation therapy in the animals
   would suggest a novel approach for treating liver injury caused by
   toxins.}},

Abstract = {{Powdered activated coke (PAC) is a good adsorbent of SO2, but its
   adsorption capacity is affected by many factors in the preparation
   process. To prepare the PAC with a high SO2 adsorption capacity using
   JJ-coal under flue gas atmosphere, six parameters (oxygen-coal
   equivalent ratio, reaction temperature, reaction time, O-2
   concentration, CO2 concentration, and H2O concentration) were screened
   and optimized using the response surface methodology (RSM). The results
   of factor screening experiment show that reaction temperature, O-2
   concentration, and H2O (g) concentration are the significant factors.
   Then, a quadratic polynomial regression model between the significant
   factors and SO2 adsorption capacity was established using the central
   composite design (CCD). The model optimization results indicate that
   when reaction temperature is 904.74 degrees C, O-2 concentration is
   4.67\%,H2O concentration is 27.98\%, the PAC (PAC-OP) prepared had a
   higher SO2 adsorption capacity of 68.15 mg/g while its SO2 adsorption
   capacity from a validation experiment is 68.82 mg/g, and the error with
   the optimal value is 0.98\%. Compared to two typical commercial
   activated cokes (ACs), PAC-OP has relatively more developed pore
   structures, and its S-BET and V-tot are 349 m(2)/g and 0.1475 cm(3)/g,
   significantly higher than the 186 m(2)/g and 0.1041 cm(3)/g of AC1, and
   the 132 m(2)/g and 0.0768 cm(3)/g of AC2. Besides, it also has abundant
   oxygen-containing functional groups, its surface O content being
   12.09\%, higher than the 10.42\% of AC1 and 10.49\% of AC2. Inevitably,
   the SO2 adsorption capacity of PAC-OP is also significantly higher than
   that of both AC1 and AC2, which is 68.82 mg/g versus 32.53 mg/g and
   24.79 mg/g, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The aeroelastic analysis has become important for aerodynamical model of
   wind turbine in predicting the wind turbine; such phenomenon is based on
   aerodynamic performance to have accuracy and feasibility through
   modeling of fractal and fractional differential techniques. In this
   context, the mathematical modeling is developed based on fractal and
   fractional differential techniques for three-dimensional nonautonomous
   model of a permanent magnet synchronous generator. The fractal and
   fractional differential techniques so called Caputo, Caputo-Fabrizio and
   Atangana-Baleanu differential operators have been invoked for the
   controllability of the stability of system. Numerical schemes for the
   mathematical model of wind turbine have been established via
   Adams-Bashforth-Moulton method. The comparative analysis of mathematical
   model of wind turbine is tackled by means of classical, fractal,
   fractional and fractal-fractional techniques through chaotic behavior.
   The role of chaotic oscillations has been depicted on the basis of
   parametric study of tip speed ratio, pitch angle, drag coefficients,
   power coefficient, air density and rotor angular speed.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AUTISM AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS}},
Abstract = {{Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are thought to
   under-rely on prior knowledge in perceptual decision-making. This study
   examined whether this applies to decisions of attention allocation, of
   relevance for `predictive-coding' accounts of ASD. In a visual search
   task, a salient but task-irrelevant distractor appeared with higher
   probability in one display half. Individuals with ASD learned to avoid
   `attentional capture' by distractors in the probable region as
   effectively as control participants-indicating typical priors for
   deploying attention. However, capture by a `surprising' distractor at an
   unlikely location led to greatly slowed identification of a subsequent
   target at that location-indicating that individuals with ASD attempt to
   control surprise (unexpected attentional capture) by over-regulating
   parameters in post-selective decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{Marine renewable energy has made significant progress in the last few
   decades. Even after making substantial progress, the cost of electricity
   produced by tidal turbines is high. Therefore, the current paper
   concentrated on reducing the cost of transportation and installation of
   the turbine by performing a model. Extreme Learning Machine and Support
   Vector Machines as well as Genetic Programming were applied to predict
   the performance of the turbine model by creating short-term,
   multistep-ahead prediction models to compute the performance of the
   H-rotor vertical axis Folding Tidal turbine. The performance of the
   turbine was verified by a numerical study using the three-dimensional
   approach for the viscous model with the unsteady flow. Statistical
   evaluation of the outcomes pointed out that advanced Extreme Learning
   Machine simulation made the assurance in formulating an innovative
   forecasting strategy for investigating the performances of the tidal
   turbine. This study shows that the application of the new procedure
   resulted in confident generality performance and learns faster than
   orthodox learning algorithms. In conclusion, the assessment indicated
   that the advanced Extreme Learning Machine simulation was capable as a
   promising alternative to existing numerical methods for computing the
   coefficient of performance for turbines.}},

Title = {{Assessing the influence of psyllium as a fat substitute in wheat and
   gluten-free cookies}},
Journal = {{FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY INTERNATIONAL}},
Abstract = {{Psyllium is a natural fibre with high water absorption capacity and
   proved nutritional advantages. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
   potential of psyllium as a fat replacer in sugar-snap cookies.
   Elaborations were made with wheat flour or maize flour by maintaining
   the original recipe or replacing the fat by a paste made with different
   proportion of psyllium and water. Cookies dough rheology and final
   cookies properties were evaluated. An acceptability test was also
   carried out. The replacement of fat decreased the values of G `, G `'
   and G{*}, but increased tg delta to a greater extent in cookies with
   gluten. Cookies diameter and spread factor decreased and increased both
   cookies hardness and moisture content. Fat replacement increase L{*}
   value of cookies. Variation of the water content did not influence in
   the rheology of the dough and in the characteristics of gluten-free
   cookies, but wheat cookies had smaller spread ratio and decreasing
   hardness for increasing amount of water. Final cookies had low
   acceptability and this result was more evident in gluten-free cookies.
   Considering this result, it is difficult to use psyllium as a total fat
   substitute in this type of product.}},

Journal = {{SEDIMENTOLOGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{68}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1159-1197}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The Calcare di Base is a carbonate/evaporitic unit formed before the
   deposition of the massive halite bodies in the main depozones of the
   Mediterranean region, and has been at the centre of a fiery debate
   between different `schools of thought' about its genesis, environmental
   conditions and timing of deposition. It crops out extensively in
   Southern Italy, across Neogene basins located on the Tyrrhenian and
   Ionian margins of northern Calabria, where it was studied through a
   detailed facies and stratigraphic analysis that revealed the presence of
   a continental/shallow-marine to slope system, active during the onset of
   the Messinian Salinity Crisis. During the Calcare di Base deposition, an
   arid climate regime with intermittent humid phases occurred with a
   precession forced cyclicity, facing an overall generally cold climatic
   period. During arid periods, stressed environmental conditions permitted
   the establishment of widespread microbial-mediated carbonate production,
   frequently associated with evaporitic (gypsum-dominated) deposition,
   along a sabkha-type environment with extensive salinas and hypersaline
   coastal lagoons grading seaward into a carbonate/evaporite
   shallow-marine shelf. This is testified to by microbial boundstones and
   dissolution breccias commonly associated with nodular gypsum and
   arenites affected by desiccation, typically forming metre-scale
   shallowing-upward peritidal cycles. Seaward, gravity flow deposits are
   interpreted as re-sedimented shelf limestones, defining a slope apron.
   Mixed carbonate/evaporite megabreccias and disorganized floatbreccias
   were deposited along the upper slope, whereas soft deformation with
   slides, slumps and channelized turbidites further developed along the
   lower slope to basin. During the humid climate episodes, that affected
   the platform system with a precession-forced cyclicity, the carbonate
   production was reduced together with the evaporitic deposition, leading
   to the widespread deposition of marlstones and fine to coarse
   siliciclastic deposits.}},

Abstract = {{Let L be a family of lines and let P be a family of k-planes in F-n
   where F is a field. In our first result we show that the number of
   joints formed by a k-plane in P together with (n - k) lines in L is
   O-n(vertical bar jL parallel to P vertical bar(1/(n k))). This is the
   first sharp result for joints involving higher-dimensional affine
   subspaces, and it holds in the setting of arbitrary fields F. In
   contrast, for our second result, we work in the three-dimensional
   Euclidean space R-3, and we establish the Kakeya-type estimate
   Sigma(x is an element of J)(Sigma(l is an element of L)chi(l)(x))(3/2)
   less than or similar to vertical bar L vertical bar(3/2)
   where J is the set of joints formed by L; such an estimate fails in the
   setting of arbitrary fields. This result strengthens the known estimates
   for joints, including those counting multiplicities. Additionally, our
   techniques yield significant structural information on quasi-extremisers

Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{Moral injury, an experience of betrayal or transgression of moral
   values, continues to receive attention because of its associations with
   psychiatric disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder and
   suicidality. There is growing recognition that moral injury may require
   novel interventions that involve religious or spiritual paradigms. This
   pilot study presents feasibility data and exploratory outcomes for 40
   veteran participants across seven cohorts who participated in a novel
   12-week moral injury group (MIG) over 35 months. The MIG was
   cofacilitated by a Veterans Affairs chaplain and psychologist and
   designed to reduce distress and improve functioning in individuals with
   histories of morally injurious experiences from military service. The
   intervention included a ceremony in which participants shared
   testimonies of their moral injury with the general public. Recruitment
   feasibility and retention were high, with participants completing an
   average of 9.45 (SD = 2.82) sessions of the 12-week group, and 32
   participants (80.0\%) attending nine or more sessions and the community
   healing ceremony. Exploratory analyses revealed medium effect sizes,
   omega(2) = 0.05-0.08, for reductions in depressive symptoms,
   improvements in psychological functioning, and self-compassion after the
   intervention, with small effect sizes, omega(2) = 0.03, in anticipated
   directions for personal growth and spiritual struggles. The results were
   not impacted by participant engagement in concurrent psychological
   treatments. Taken together, these findings support the feasibility of
   the MIG, the potential merit of an interdisciplinary approach to
   addressing moral injury, and justification for further research into the
   efficacy of this approach.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Background
   In pancreatic cancer, toxicities associated with current
   chemotherapeutic regimens remain concerning. A modified combination of
   gemcitabine, S-1, and leucovorin (GSL) was used as the first-line
   treatment for newly diagnosed locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic
   adenocarcinoma patients.
   Methods
   GSL was administered every 2 weeks-intravenous gemcitabine 800 mg/m(2)
   at a fixed-dose rate of 10 mg/m(2)/min on day 1 and oral S-1 (80-120
   mg/day) plus leucovorin 30 mg twice daily on days 1-7. We
   retrospectively analyzed the feasibility of GSL and patient outcomes in
   three medical centers in Taiwan.
   Results
   Overall, 49 patients received GSL with a median follow-up of 24.9 months
   from May 2015 to March 2019. The median patient age was 68 years (range,
   47-83 years), with a marginally higher number of females (57.1\%). Among
   the 44 patients who underwent image evaluation, 13 demonstrated a
   partial response (29.5\%) and 17 presented with stable disease (38.6\%).
   The partial response rate and stable disease rate was 26.5\% and 34.7\%,
   respectively, in the intent-to-treat analysis. The median
   time-to-treatment failure was 5.79 months (95\% C.I., 2.63-8.94),
   progression-free survival was 6.94 months (95\% C.I., 5.55-8.33), and
   overall survival time was 11.53 months (95\% C.I., 9.94-13.13). For GSL
   treatment, the most common grade 3 or worse toxicities were anemia
   (18.3\%), neutropenia (6.1\%), nausea (4.1\%), and mucositis (4.1\%).
   Treatment discontinuation was mostly due to disease progression
   (65.3\%).
   Conclusions
   The modified GSL therapy can be a promising and affordable treatment for
   patients with advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer in Taiwan. A
   prospective trial of modified GSL for elderly patients is currently
   ongoing in Taiwan.}},

Abstract = {{Crop diseases have a devastating effect on agricultural production, and
   serious diseases can lead to harvest failure entirely. Recent
   developments in deep learning have greatly improved the accuracy of
   image identification. In this study, we investigated the transfer
   learning of deep convolutional neural networks and modified the network
   structure to improve the learning capability of plant lesion
   characteristics. The MobileNet with squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block
   was selected in our approach. Integrating the merits of both, the
   pre-trained MobileNet and SE block were fused to form a new network,
   which we termed the SE-MobileNet, and was used to identify the plant
   diseases. In particular, the transfer learning was performed twice to
   obtain the optimum model. The first phase trained the model for the
   extended layers while the bottom convolution layers were frozen with the
   pre-trained weights on ImageNet; by loading the model trained in the
   first phase, the second phase retrained the model using the target
   dataset. The proposed procedure provides a significant increase in
   efficiency relative to other state-of-the-art methods. It reaches an
   average accuracy of 99.78\% in the public dataset with clear backdrops.
   Even under multiple classes and heterogeneous background conditions, the
   average accuracy realises 99.33\% for identifying the rice disease
   types. The experimental findings show the feasibility and effectiveness
   of the proposed procedure.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Real-world clinical data on psoriasis patients receiving different
   biological agents is needed, especially in Asian populations.
   Objectives
   Our aim is to compare and analyze the efficacy and safety profile of
   four biological agents (etanercept, adalimumab, ustekinumab and
   secukinumab) in a real-world setting in Taiwan.
   Methods
   We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of all patients with
   moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index
   (PASI) >= 10) who received etanercept, adalimumab, ustekinumab or
   secukinumab between January 2011 and December 2018 in a tertiary
   hospital in Taiwan.
   Results
   A total of 119 treatment episodes in 75 patients were included in this
   study. Ustekinumab was used in 49 treatment episodes, followed by
   secukinumab in 46 treatment episodes, adalimumab in 14 treatment
   episodes and etanercept in 10 treatment episodes. The proportion of the
   biologic-naive was highest in etanercept (100\%) and lowest in
   secukinumab (23.9\%). The PASI-75, -90 and -100 were the highest in
   secukinumab (91.3\%, 82.6\%, 41.3\%, respectively), followed by
   ustekinumab (79.6\%, 44.9\%, 16.3\%), adalimumab (64.3\%, 28.6\%, 7.1\%)
   and etanercept (50.0\%, 30.0\%, 0\%). The rate of adverse events that
   required treatment was highest for secukinumab (15.2\%), followed by
   adalimumab (14.3\%), ustekinumab (8.2\%), and etanercept (0\%),
   including 4 cases of infections, 2 cases of cardiovascular diseases and
   4 cases of cancers.
   Conclusions
   This real world data showed differential efficacy and safety of the four
   biological agents.}},

Title = {{Two neutrino double-beta decay in pionless effective field theory from a
   Euclidean finite-volume correlation function}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 29}},
Abstract = {{Two-neutrino double-beta decay of certain nuclear isotopes is one of the
   rarest Standard Model processes observed in nature. Its neutrinoless
   counterpart is an exotic lepton-number nonconserving process that is
   widely searched to determine if the neutrinos are Majorana fennions. In
   order to connect the rate of these processes to the Standard Model and
   beyond the Standard Model interactions, it is essential that the
   corresponding nuclear matrix elements are constrained reliably from
   theory. Lattice quantum chromo-dynamics (LQCD) and low-energy effective
   field theories (EFTS) arc expected to play an essential role in
   constraining the matrix element of the two-nucleon subprocess, which
   could in turn provide the input into ab initio nuclear-structure
   calculations in larger isotopes. Focusing on the two-neutrino process nn
   -> pp(ee (v) over bar (e)(v) over bar (e)), the amplitude is constructed
   in this work in pionless EFT at next-to-leading order, demonstrating the
   emergence of a renormalization-scale independent amplitude and the
   absence of any new low-energy constant at this order beyond those
   present in the single-weak process. Most importantly, it is shown how a
   LQCD four-point correlation function in Euclidean and finite-volume
   spacetime can be used to constrain the Minkowski infinite-volume
   amplitude in the EFT. The same formalism is provided for the related
   single-weak process, which is an input to the double-beta decay
   formalism. The LQCD-EFT matching procedure outlined for the double-weak
   amplitude paves the road toward constraining the two-nucleon matrix
   element entering the neutrinoless double-beta decay amplitude with a
   light Majorana neutrino.}},

Abstract = {{Recent works have shown that deep-learning-derived methods based on
   convolutional neural network can achieve high performance in terms of
   accuracy when applied to computer vision task such as object detection,
   segmentation and classification particularly on hyperspectral image.
   However, the existing methods have long training times. To reduce the
   training time and increase the accuracy, this paper proposed a new 3D2D
   convolutional neural network combined for hyperspectral image
   classification. For this purpose, a 3D fast learning block (depthwise
   separable convolution block and a fast convolution block) followed by a
   2D convolutional neural network was introduced to extract
   spectralspatial features. Four datasets were used for the experiment
   purpose and the results showed that the proposed method achieved
   excellent result on both small and large training data compared with
   existing methods. The proposed method increased the overall accuracies
   by 2\% on UP and KSC datasets while significantly reducing the training
   time on IP and KSC datasets, respectively. The proposed method increased
   all accuracies for at least 6\% on IP, KSC and UP datasets when compared
   to some state-of-the-art methods. Also, it reduced considerably the
   training and testing time on IP and KSC datasets when fast convolution
   block alone is involved.}},

Title = {{Aortic endograft and bridging stent-graft remodeling after branched
   endovascular aortic repair}},
Journal = {{VASCULAR}},
Abstract = {{Objectives
   The results of branched endovascular repair of thoracoabdominal
   aneurysms are mainly dependent on durability of the graft used. The
   purpose of this study was to evaluate postoperative aortic main body and
   bridging stent-graft remodeling, and their impact on bridging
   stent-graft instability at one year.
   Methods
   Computed tomoangiographies of 43 patients (43 aortic main body mated
   with 171 bridging stent-grafts) were analyzed before and after branched
   endovascular repair as well as after a follow-up of 12 months. Primary
   endpoint was aortic main body remodeling (migration >5 mm, shortening >5
   mm, scoliosis >5 degrees or lordosis >5 degrees). Shortening was defined
   as a reduced length in the long axis, scoliosis as left-right curvature,
   and lordosis as antero-posterior curvature. Aortic main body remodeling,
   aneurysm sac changes, and bridging stent-graft tortuosity were evaluated
   to study their correlations and the impact on the bridging stent-graft
   instability.
   Results
   At 12 months, aortic main body remodeling was observed in 72\% of the
   cases, migration in 39.5\% (mean 5.21 mm), shortening in 41.9\% (mean
   5.79 mm), scoliosis in 58.1\%, (mean 10.10 degrees), lordosis in 44.2\%
   (mean 5.78 degrees). Migration, shortening, and scoliosis were more
   frequent in patients with larger aneurysms (p = .005), while scoliosis
   was significantly more frequent in type II thoracoabdominal aneurysm (p
   = .019). Aortic main body remodeling was significantly associated to
   bridging stent-graft remodeling (r: 0.3-0.48). The bridging stent-graft
   instability rate was 9.3\%. Despite a trend toward significance (p =
   .07), none of the evaluated aortic main body and bridging stent-graft
   changes were associated with bridging stent-graft instability at 12
   months.
   Conclusions
   Aortic main body remodeling is frequent especially in large and extended
   thoracoabdominal aneurysm aneurysms. Aortic main body and bridging
   stent-graft remodeling was significantly correlated. While these
   geometric changes had no significant impact on bridging stent-graft
   instability at one year, a close long-term follow-up after branched
   endovascular repair could predict bridging stent-graft failures.}},

Abstract = {{To develop and validate an effective model for distinguishing COVID-19
   from bacterial pneumonia. In the training group and internal validation
   group, all patients were randomly divided into a training group (n =
   245) and a validation group (n = 105). The whole lung lesion on chest
   computed tomography (CT) was drawn as the region of interest (ROI) for
   each patient. Both feature selection and model construction were first
   performed in the training set and then further tested in the validation
   set with the same thresholds. Additional tests were conducted on an
   external multicentre cohort with 105 subjects. The diagnostic model of
   LightGBM showed the best performance, achieving a sensitivity of 0.941,
   specificity of 0.981, accuracy of 0.962 on the validation dataset. In
   this study, we established a differential model to distinguish between
   COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia based on chest CT radiomics and

Abstract = {{Objective To evaluate the association between obstetric and medical risk
   factors and stillbirths in a Kenyan set-up.
   Methods A case-control study was conducted in four hospitals between
   August 2018 and April 2019. Two hundred and fourteen women with
   stillbirths and 428 with live births at more than >28 weeks of gestation
   were enrolled. Data collection was via interviews and abstraction from
   medical records. Outcome variables were stillbirth and live birth;
   exposure variables were sociodemographic characteristics, and medical
   and obstetric factors. The two-sample t test and chi(2) test were used
   to compare continuous and categorical variables respectively. The
   association between the exposure and outcome variable was done using
   logistic regression. A P value less than 0.05 was considered
   statistically significant.
   Results Stillbirth was associated with pre-eclampsia without severe
   features (odds ratio {[}OR] 9.1, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]
   2.6-32.5), pre-eclampsia with severe features (OR 7.4, 95\% CI
   2.4-22.8); eclampsia (OR 9.2, 95\% CI 2.6-32.5), placenta previa (OR 8.6
   95\% CI 2.8-25.9), placental abruption (OR 6.9 95\% CI 2.2-21.3),
   preterm delivery(OR 9.5, 95\% CI 5.7-16), and gestational diabetes
   mellitus, (OR 11.5, 95\% CI 2.5-52.6). Stillbirth was not associated
   with multiparity, anemia, and HIV.
   Conclusion Proper antepartum care and surveillance to identify and
   manage medical and obstetric conditions with the potential to cause
   stillbirth are recommended.}},

Abstract = {{The main goal of this research was to analyze the three-way interactive
   effects of corporate social responsibility (CSR), green human resource

   tested using data from a survey of 261 Millennial employees in five-star
   hotels in China. The results indicated that the three-way interactive
   effect of CSR, GHRM, and responsible leadership on employee green
   behavior and performance was significant and positive. In addition,
   green behavior played a mediation role in this relationship after
   controlling the effect of organizational identity. This suggests that
   behavioral improvements are a better predictor of performance than
   perceptions of organizational identity. The analysis enriches the
   context-behavior-performance framework literature and highlights that
   organizations can enhance sustainability by implementing CSR, GHRM, and

Title = {{Comparative Analysis of Majority Language Influence on North Sami
   Prosody Using WaveNet-Based modeling}},
Journal = {{LANGUAGE AND SPEECH}},
Abstract = {{The Finnmark North Sami is a variety of North Sami language, an
   indigenous, endangered minority language spoken in the northernmost
   parts of Norway and Finland. The speakers of this language are
   bilingual, and regularly speak the majority language (Finnish or
   Norwegian) as well as their own North Sami variety. In this paper we
   investigate possible influences of these majority languages on prosodic
   characteristics of Finnmark North Sami, and associate them with prosodic
   patterns prevalent in the majority languages. We present a novel
   methodology that: (a) automatically finds the portions of speech (words)
   where the prosodic differences based on majority languages are most
   robustly manifested; and (b) analyzes the nature of these differences in
   terms of intonational patterns. For the first step, we trained
   convolutional WaveNet speech synthesis models on North Sami speech
   material, modified to contain purely prosodic information, and used
   conditioning embeddings to find words with the greatest differences
   between the varieties. The subsequent exploratory analysis suggests that
   the differences in intonational patterns between the two Finnmark North
   Sami varieties are not manifested uniformly across word types (based on
   part-of-speech category). Instead, we argue that the differences reflect
   phrase-level prosodic characteristics of the majority languages.}},

Abstract = {{In this contribution observed collapse frequencies and calculated

   comparison is mainly based on values from the literature. These were
   recorded in the context of a literature search. Furthermore, collapse
   frequencies for earthquake impacts were determined by own calculations.
   The comparison of collapse frequencies and failure probabilities of
   retaining structures shows a good agreement. However, the comparison of
   the values with other types of structures shows an above-average
   frequency of collapses. This seemingly accepted high frequency of
   collapse is justified by the lower number of-victims and damage costs

Abstract = {{The fundamental goal of generative drug design is to propose optimized
   molecules that meet predefined activity, selectivity, and
   pharmacokinetic criteria. Despite recent progress, we argue that
   existing generative methods are limited in their ability to favorably
   shift the distributions of molecular properties during optimization. We
   instead propose a novel Reinforcement Learning framework for molecular
   design in which an agent learns to directly optimize through a space of
   synthetically accessible drug-like molecules. This becomes possible by
   defining transitions in our Markov decision process as chemical
   reactions and allows us to leverage synthetic routes as an inductive
   bias. We validate our method by demonstrating that it outperforms
   existing state-of-the-art approaches in the optimization of
   pharmacologically relevant objectives, while results on multi-objective
   optimization tasks suggest increased scalability to realistic
   pharmaceutical design problems.}},

   nonlinear systems, which has been studied extensively in recent years.
   However, analysis focused on individual orbits seems hard to extend to
   complex systems, while a global statistical approach is overly cursory.
   Koopman operator technique seems to balance well the two approaches. In
   this paper we extend Koopman analysis to the study of synchronization of
   coupled oscillators by extracting important eigenvalues and
   eigenfunctions from the observed time series. A renormalization group
   analysis is designed to derive an analytic approximation of the
   eigenfunction in the case of weak coupling that dominates the
   oscillation. For moderate or strong couplings, numerical computation
   further confirms the importance of the average frequencies and the
   associated eigenfunctions. The synchronization transition points could
   be located with quite high accuracy by checking the correlation of
   neighboring eigenfunctions at different coupling strengths, which is
   readily applied to other nonlinear systems.}},

Abstract = {{All-inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted tremendous
   attention over the past few years owing to their outstanding thermal and
   moiture stability. Electron transport layers (ETLs) in PSCs play a
   prominent role of electron extraction and transportation as well as hole
   blocking for a high power conversion efficiency (PCE). Indium sulfide
   (In2S3) films have been introduced as a promising ETL of PSCs recently
   due to their high carrier mobility, appropriate band gap, and
   controllable electrical characteristics. Herein, a facile wet chemistry
   method is proposed to prepare In2S3 films for the ETLs of all-inorganic
   CsPbBr3 PSCs with an architecture of fluorine-doped tin
   oxide/In2S3/CsPbBr3/carbon. The resultant compact In2S3 films show a
   certain visible light absorption with a bandgap of 2.51 eV. With the
   optimal 3000 rpm speed of In2S3 spin-coating, the best-performing In2S3
   based device presents a higher champion PCE of 5.83\% with open circuit
   voltage of 1.34 V, a short circuit current density of 6.74 mA cm(-2) and
   a fill factor of 0.65. The better performance of devices based on In2S3
   ETLs is attributed to their more suitable energy level matching with
   less open circuit voltage loss, better light harvesting, and electron
   extraction capability enhancement.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY PHARMACY PRACTICE}},
Abstract = {{Introduction
   Pulmonary toxicity causally related to Imatinib (IM) therapy is uncommon
   in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.
   Case report
   A 61-year-old patient with chronic myeloid leukemia was treated with IM
   at 400 mg daily dose. One month within IM, he developed skin lesions and
   then acute dyspnea and non-productive cough. Chest radiograph and
   high-resolution lung computed tomography (CT) revealed bilateral
   reticulonodular infiltration in both lungs. According to Naranjo's
   algorithm, the causality relationship with the drug is probable with a
   score of 7. The pharmacovigilance investigation was carried out and
   implicated IM
   Management \& outcome: IM was discontinued and started steroid therapy
   (Prednisolone (R)) at 1 mg/kg daily. Two weeks after, the dyspnea, and
   abnormal X-ray and CT findings are improved.
   Discussion
   The early diagnosis of pulmonary toxicity related to IM therapy is
   needed to avoid further determinal effects of the drug.}},

Abstract = {{Background Participatory research methods are gaining interest. In
   applying these methods, there is often a lack of consideration for
   methodological issues. Furthermore, a unifying system for categorizing
   the various approaches does not exist. Objectives Based on a scoping
   review, a categorization of participatory research methods to promote
   health equity was undertaken. Material and methods Included in the
   review are 44 publications in German and English retrieved from various
   databases (PubMed, PsycInfo, SocIndex, Livivo, Cochrane, Fachportal
   Padagogik). Additional publications were identified by hand searching
   and using the snowball method. Results The methods are categorized by
   research phase and type of format used. The principles of
   multidimensionality and phase integration are central to the proposed
   system of categorization, resulting in a primary distinction between the
   methods used to facilitate the participatory research process versus
   methods used for participatory data collection and analysis. The
   majority of methods identified are used for data collection or reflexive
   processes. There are gaps in the German literature regarding methods for
   cooperative decision making, participatory data analysis, and the
   application of research results. Conclusion The classification system
   provides an overview of available methods and the degree of
   participation they promote. The system draws attention to the spectrum
   of methods available, being useful for both teaching and research
   purposes.}},

Title = {{Initiation of Buprenorphine/Naloxone on Rates of Discharge Against
   Medical Advice}},
Journal = {{HOSPITAL PHARMACY}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Evidence shows that patients with opioid use disorder (OUD)
   have an increased rate of discharge against medical advice (DAMA) as
   well as higher rates of hospital readmission. Therefore, the objective
   of this study was to determine if inpatient initiation of
   buprenorphine/naloxone in patients with OUD is associated with decreased
   rates of DAMA. Methods: This was a single center retrospective cohort
   study conducted at a level 1, academic medical center. The study
   included patients with OUD admitted to the Internal Medicine service
   from January through May of both 2018 and 2019 for an admitting
   diagnosis other than opioid withdrawal. The primary endpoint was rate of
   DAMA among OUD patients not initiated on opioid agonist therapy compared
   to those initiated on buprenorphine/naloxone. The secondary endpoint was
   the association between factors of the initiation process on rates of
   DAMA. Patients were excluded if they were discharged in less than 24
   hours or received intermittent administration of buprenorphine/naloxone.
   Results: The rate of DAMA in OUD patients not initiated on
   buprenorphine/naloxone was 13.85\% compared to 2.56\% in those initiated
   on buprenorphine/naloxone (P = .048). Conclusion: In OUD patients
   initiated on buprenorphine/naloxone, the rate of DAMA was significantly
   lower than those who were not. This data supports the importance of
   optimizing the opportunity to initiate buprenorphine/naloxone in the
   acute care setting to minimize withdrawal symptoms therefore reducing
   the rate of DAMA. Ultimately increasing the ability to adequately treat
   the primary reason for admission and potentially decreasing readmission
   rates. Further studies are needed to evaluate this impact as this study
   is limited to a small sample size therefore lacking adequate power.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) materials have recently provided a new perspective
   on optoelectronics because of their unique layered structure and
   excellent physical properties. However, their potential use as
   optoelectric devices has been limited by the trade-off between
   photoresponsivity and response time. Here, based on a vertically stacked
   atomically thin p-n junction, we propose a gap-mode plasmon structure
   that simultaneously enables enhanced responsivity and rapid
   photodetection. The atomically thin 2D materials act as a spacer for
   enhancing the gap-mode plasmons, and their short transit length in the
   vertical direction allows fast photocarrier transport. We demonstrate a
   high responsivity of up to 8.67 A/W with a high operation speed that
   exceeds 35 MHz under a 30 nW laser power. Spectral photocurrent,
   absorption, and a numerical simulation are used to verify the
   effectiveness of the gap-mode plasmons in the device. We believe that
   the design strategy proposed in this study can pave the way for a
   platform to overcome the trade-off between responsivity and response
   time.}},

   Analytical studies of this phenomenon are primarily based on two

   these approaches for two-dimensional spin systems. Via exact
   manipulations, we demonstrate how parton gauge theories arise in
   microscopic wire arrays and explicitly relate spin operators to emergent
   quasiparticles and gauge-field monopoles. This correspondence allows us
   to compute physical correlation functions within both formulations and
   leads to a straightforward algorithm for constructing parent
   Hamiltonians for a wide range of exotic phases. We exemplify this

Abstract = {{In a recent work, new two-dimensional materials, monolayer MoSi2N4 and
   WSi2N4, were successfully synthesized in experiment, and several other
   monolayer materials with a similar structure, such as MoSi2As4, were
   predicted {[}Hong et al., Science 369, 670 (2020)]. Here, based on
   first-principles calculations and theoretical analysis, we investigate
   the electronic and optical properties of monolayer MoSi2N4, WSi2N4, and
   MoSi2As4. We show that these materials are semiconductors, with a pair
   of Dirac-type valleys located at the corners of the hexagonal Brillouin
   zone. Due to the broken inversion symmetry and the effect of spin-orbit
   coupling, the valley fermions manifest spin-valley coupling,
   valley-contrasting Berry curvature, and valley-selective optical
   circular dichroism. We also construct the low-energy effective model for
   the valleys, calculate the spin Hall conductivity and the permittivity,
   and investigate the strain effect on the band structure. Our result
   reveals interesting valley physics in monolayer MoSi2N4, WSi2N4, and
   MoSi2As4, suggesting their great potential for valleytronics and
   spintronics applications.}},

Abstract = {{The S-3 state is the last semi-stable state in the water splitting
   reaction that is catalyzed by the Mn4O5Ca cluster that makes up the
   oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II (PSII). Recent
   high-field/frequency (95 GHz) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)
   studies of PSII isolated from the thermophilic cyanobacterium
   Thermosynechococcus elongatus have found broadened signals induced by
   chemical modification of the S-3 state. These signals are ascribed to an
   S-3 form that contains a five-coordinate Mn-IV center bridged to a
   cuboidal (Mn3O4Ca)-O-IV unit. High-resolution X-ray free-electron laser
   studies of the S-3 state have observed the OEC with all-octahedrally
   coordinated Mn-IV in what is described as an open cuboid-like cluster.
   No five-coordinate Mn-IV centers have been reported in these S-3 state
   structures. Here, we report high-field/frequency (130 GHz) pulse EPR of
   the S-3 state in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 PSII as isolated in the
   presence of glycerol. The S-3 state of PSII from Synechocystis exhibits
   multiple broadened forms (approximate to 69\% of the total signal)
   similar to those seen in the chemically modified S3 centers from T.
   elongatus. Field-dependent ELDOR-detected nuclear magnetic resonance
   resolves two classes of `Mn nuclear spin transitions: one class with
   small hyperfine couplings (vertical bar A vertical bar approximate to
   1-7 MHz) and another with larger hyperfine couplings (vertical bar A
   vertical bar approximate to 100 MHz). These results are consistent with
   an all-Mn-4(IV) open cubane structure of the S-3 state and suggest that
   the broadened S-3 signals arise from a perturbation of Mn4A and/or Mn3B,
   possibly induced by the presence of glycerol in the as-isolated
   Synechocystis PSII.}},

Title = {{Modern Family Planning Utilization and Its Associated Factors among
   Currently Married Women in Rural Eastern Ethiopia: A Community-Based
   Study}},
Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{DEC 29}},
Abstract = {{Background. The use of modern family planning methods among women of
   reproductive age (15-49 years) is of public health importance in
   Ethiopia. Nationally, modern family planning method use remains as low
   as 35\%. Understanding factors associated with the use of modern family
   planning methods may help to improve maternal and child health. Hence,
   this study is aimed at assessing modern family planning method use and
   its determinants among women of reproductive age in the rural districts
   of Eastern Hararghe zone, Eastern Ethiopia. Methodology. A
   community-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted among 577 randomly
   selected, currently married, reproductive-aged women in selected rural
   districts of Eastern Hararghe, Eastern Ethiopia. Data were collected
   using a pretested, interviewer-administered questionnaire about women's
   sociodemographic information, knowledge about contraception,
   reproductive history, contraceptive use and fertility desire, couple's
   communication, and decision-making on family planning. Binary and
   multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze the association
   between the dependent and independent variables. Result. A total of 555
   study participants participated, yielding a 96.2\% response rate. The
   overall modern family planning utilization among the study participants
   was 18.4\%. Knowledge of modern family planning methods (AOR=16.958, CI:
   4.768, 60.316), husband approval (AOR=3.590, CI: 2.170, 5.936), couple's
   discussion (AOR=2.852, CI: 1.759, 4.623), male involvement in decisions
   about family planning (AOR=2.340, CI: 1.531, 3.576), desire for
   additional child (AOR=2.295, CI: 1.528, 3.447), and previous use of
   contraception (AOR=0.018, CI: 0.005, 0.063) were significantly
   associated with modern contraceptive utilization. Conclusion. Even
   though knowledge of modern family planning methods was very high, the
   overall modern family planning method use in the study area was low. The
   government should focus on increasing modern family planning method
   availability. It must also ensure family planning method security and
   create awareness on modern family planning methods through
   community-based education and proper counselling to empower women to
   make an appropriate choice.}},

Abstract = {{A poorly coordinated performance among stakeholders in the finishing
   phase can impair the performance of a high-rise building project.
   Therefore, it is necessary to analyze construction failure factors
   (CFFs) to stakeholder coordinating performance (SCP) in the finishing
   phase of high-rise building projects and to uncover their underlying
   relationships. CFFs to SCP in construction projects, especially in the
   finishing phase of high-rise building projects, have not yet been
   discovered. The study identified 30 CFFs to the SCP and ranked them
   according to the perspective of the stakeholders, including
   owners/consultants and contractors/subcontractors. Additionally, four
   factors of the CFFs, namely, traditional adversarial relationship, poor
   project planning and organization, incompetent parties, and delays of
   parties toward construction works were extracted by the factor analysis
   method. This study fills the gap in knowledge related to the
   coordination performance in construction projects. The findings could
   help stakeholders to enhance their coordinating performance in high-rise
   building projects.}},

Title = {{Is Appropriate Administration of Antenatal Corticosteroids Associated
   with Maternal Race?}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Objective Antenatal corticosteroids (ACSs) improve outcomes for
   premature infants; however, not all pregnant women at risk for preterm
   delivery receive ACS. Racial minorities are less likely to receive
   adequate prenatal care and more likely to deliver preterm. The objective
   of this study was to determine if maternal race is associated with a
   lower rate of ACS administration in Washington for women at risk of
   preterm labor (between 23 and 34 weeks).
   Study Design This was a population-based retrospective cohort study of
   singleton, nonanomalous, premature deliveries in Washington state
   between 2007 and 2014. Descriptive data included maternal
   sociodemographics, pregnancy complications, facility of birth, and
   neonatal characteristics. The primary outcome was maternal receipt of
   ACS and the independent variable was maternal race/ethnicity. The
   secondary outcomes included neonatal need for assisted ventilation, both
   initially and for more than 6 hours, and administration of surfactant.
   Data were analyzed using chi-square tests and logistic regression
   models.
   Results A total of 8,530 nonanomalous, singleton neonates were born
   between 23 and 34 weeks' gestation. Of those, 55.8\% of mothers were
   self-identified as white, 7.5\% as black, 21.4\% as Hispanic, 10.9\% as
   Asian, and 4.3\% as Native American. After adjusting for confounders,
   black woman-neonate dyads had significantly lower odds of receiving ACS,
   (adjusted odds ratio {[}aOR] = 0.62; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]:
   0.51-0.76), assisted ventilation immediately following delivery (aOR =
   0.76; 95\% CI: 0.61-0.94) and for more than 6 hours (aOR = 0.64; 95\%
   CI: 0.49-0.84) and surfactant therapy (aOR = 0.62; 95\% CI: 0.42-0.92)
   as compared with whites.
   Conclusion These findings contribute to the current body of literature
   by describing racial disparities in ACS administration for pregnant
   women at risk for preterm delivery. To better understand the association
   between black race and administration of ACS, future studies should
   focus on differences within and between hospitals (including quality,
   location, resources), patient health literacy, social determinants of
   health, and exposure to systemic racism and discrimination.}},

Abstract = {{Haploinsufficiency of the methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 5 ( MBD5 )
   gene is reported as a cause of an autosomal dominant type of cognitive
   disability (MRD1) and autism spectrum disorder through large deletions
   involving multiple genes or point mutations, ultimately leading to
   haploinsufficiency in both cases. However, relatively few reports have
   been published on the phenotypical spectrum resulting from point
   mutations.
   We report here on a novel heterozygous frameshift variant in the MBD5
   gene {[}c.2579del; p.(Lys860Argfs{*}11)] in a family in which the
   typical signs associated with pathogenic variants were expressed with
   different degrees of severity in the clinical presentation of the
   carrier individuals.
   Our findings, adding a novel mutation to the mutational spectrum,
   further support the relevance of the MBD5 gene as one of the main
   molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of intellectual
   disability and contribute to the characterization of the
   genotype-phenotype correlations.}},

Abstract = {{Using maps effectively requires the ability to scale distances while
   preserving angle and orientation, the three properties of Euclidean
   geometry. The aim of the current study was twofold: first, to examine
   how the ability to represent and use these Euclidean properties changes
   with development when scaling maps in object-to-object relationships
   and, second, to explore the effects on the scaling performance of two
   variables of the array of objects, type of angular configuration and
   relative vector length. To this end, we tested seventy-five 4-, 6-, and
   8-year-old children, as well as twenty-five adults, in a simple
   completion task with different linear and triangular configurations of
   objects. This study revealed important developmental changes between 4
   and 6 years of age and between 8 years of age and adulthood for both
   distance and angle representation, while it also showed that the
   configuration variables affected younger and older children's
   performances in different ways when scaling distances and preserving
   angles and orientation. This study was instrumental in showing that,
   from an early age, children are able to exploit an intrinsic system of
   reference to scale geometrical configurations of objects.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Meta-analysis results are usually presented in forest plots, which show
   the individual study results and the summary effect along with their
   confidence intervals. In this paper, we propose a system of linear
   springs as a mechanical analogue of meta-analysis that enables
   visualization and enhances intuition. The length of a spring corresponds
   to a study treatment effect and the stiffness of the spring corresponds
   to its inverse variance. To synthesize study springs we use two main
   operations: connection in parallel and connection in series. We show the
   equivalence between meta-analysis and linear springs for fixed effect
   and random effects pairwise meta-analysis and we also derive indirect
   treatment effects. We use examples to illustrate the different
   meta-analytical schemes using the corresponding system of springs. The
   proposed visualization can serve as an educational tool, especially
   useful for researchers with no statistical background. The analogy
   between meta-analysis and springs facilitates intuition for notions such
   as heterogeneity and the differences between fixed and random effects
   meta-analysis.}},

Title = {{Iron (III)-Quercetin Complex: Synthesis, Physicochemical
   Characterization, and MRI Cell Tracking toward Potential Applications in
   Regenerative Medicine}},
Journal = {{CONTRAST MEDIA \& MOLECULAR IMAGING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{DEC 29}},
Abstract = {{In cell therapy, contrast agents T1 and T2 are both needed for the
   labeling and tracking of transplanted stem cells over extended periods
   of time through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Importantly, the
   metal-quercetin complex via coordination chemistry has been studied
   extensively for biomedical applications, such as anticancer therapies
   and imaging probes. Herein, we report on the synthesis,
   characterization, and labeling of the iron (III)-quercetin complex,
   ``IronQ,{''} in circulating proangiogenic cells (CACs) and also explore
   tracking via the use of a clinical 1.5 Tesla (T) MRI scanner. Moreover,
   IronQ had a paramagnetic T1 positive contrast agent property with a
   saturation magnetization of 0.155 emu/g at 1.0 T and longitudinal
   relaxivity (r1) values of 2.29 and 3.70 mM(-1)s(-1) at 1.5 T for water
   and human plasma, respectively. Surprisingly, IronQ was able to promote
   CAC growth in conventional cell culture systems without the addition of
   specific growth factors. Increasing dosages of IronQ from 0 to 200 mu
   g/mL led to higher CAC uptake, and maximum labeling time was achieved in
   10 days. The accumulated IronQ in CACs was measured by two
   methodologies, an inductively coupled plasma optical emission
   spectrometry (ICP-EOS) and T1-weighted MRI. In our research, we
   confirmed that IronQ has excellent dual functions with the use of an
   imaging probe for MRI. IronQ can also act as a stimulating agent by
   favoring circulating proangiogenic cell differentiation. Optimistically,
   IronQ is considered beneficial for alternative labeling and in the
   tracking of circulation proangiogenic cells and/or other stem cells in
   applications of cell therapy through noninvasive magnetic resonance
   imaging in both preclinical and clinical settings.}},

Title = {{Negligible hormonal response following dehorning in free-ranging white
   rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum)}},
Journal = {{CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 29}},
Abstract = {{The white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum) is experiencing unsustainable
   poaching losses fuelled by a demand for horn. Increasingly, private and
   state reserves are dehorning their rhinoceros populations in an attempt
   to reduce poaching pressure. Rhinoceroses use their horns in social
   interactions as well as during resource access and so its partial
   removal as part of reserve management practices may adversely influence
   these behaviours. Physiological stress can correlate with animal
   welfare, reproductive state and health and thus acts as a useful
   indicator of these parameters. To establish whether dehorning causes a
   physiological stress response, glucocorticoid and gonadal steroid
   profiles of free-ranging white rhinoceroses were determined through the
   collection and analysis of faecal steroid metabolites before and after
   dehorning. Faecal corticoid profiles were not influenced by the number
   of occasions a rhinoceros had been dehorned or by the number of days
   that had elapsed since dehorning. Furthermore, there was no apparent
   suppression in the concentrations of testosterone or progesterone
   metabolites in males and females, respectively, after exposure to
   multiple dehorning procedures. These findings should increase wildlife
   managers' confidence that dehorning does not negatively impact white
   rhinoceros physiology as measured hormonally.}},

Abstract = {{Cutaneous metastases due to internal malignancies are rare but, in some

   quasiparticle random-phase approximation}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW C}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 29}},
Abstract = {{The electron-capture process plays an important role in the evolution of
   the core collapse of a massive star that precedes the supernova
   explosion. In this study, the electron capture on nuclei in stellar
   environment is described in the relativistic energy density functional
   framework, including both the finite-temperature and nuclear pairing
   effects. Relevant nuclear transitions J(pi) = 0(+/-), 1(+/-) , 2(+/-
   )are calculated using the finite-temperature proton-neutron
   quasiparticle random-phase approximation with the density-dependent
   meson-exchange effective interaction DD-ME2. The pairing and temperature
   effects are investigated in the Gamow-Teller transition strength as well
   as the electron-capture cross sections and rates for Ti-44 and Fe-56 in
   the stellar environment. It is found that the pairing correlations
   establish an additional unblocking mechanism similar to the
   finite-temperature effects, that can allow otherwise blocked
   single-particle transitions. Inclusion of pairing correlations at finite
   temperature can significantly alter the electron-capture cross sections,
   even up to a factor of 2 for Ti-44, while for the same nucleus
   electron-capture rates can increase by more than one order of magnitude.
   We conclude that for the complete description of electron capture on
   nuclei both pairing and temperature effects must be taken into account.}},

   demands and the stress and conflicts of caregiving. Both employers and
   CG employees are challenged by the need to address this problem.
   Method:
   A cross-sectional Canadian survey was distributed nationally to working
   informal CGs of older adults in 2015 to 2016. It was designed to
   investigate the relative predictive roles of caregiving variables, job
   demands, balancing work and caregiving variables, and work-related
   factors on work and employee outcomes. Our sample was comprised of
   employees (N = 1,839) who were concurrently providing informal care for
   an older adult with specific attention to those caring for care
   recipients (CR) with dementia. We employed hierarchical and ordinal
   multiple regression to examine CG and caregiving characteristics, family
   and job demands, and balancing job-caregiving variables as predictors of
   work-related outcomes including work engagement, employment/employee
   changes index, absenteeism, and intent-to-turnover.
   Results:
   After controlling for CGs' age, sex, and family financial situation, we
   found dementia demands, job-caregiving conflict, effective manager, and
   organizational culture were significant predictors of five out of six
   work and employee outcomes. Role overload was significantly associated
   with four outcomes.
   Conclusion:
   To our knowledge, this is the first study of this size to explore the
   association of these predictive variables with work-related outcomes and
   to refine the understanding of the profile of employed CGs of older
   adults with dementia. Sustaining working CGs of older adults may require
   new `talent management' approaches rather than simply increasing the
   number of benefits.}},

Abstract = {{There continues to be limited, viable ventricular assist device
   technology options to support the dysfunctional states of pediatric
   heart failure. To address this need, we are developing a magnetically
   suspended, versatile pumping technology that uniquely integrates two
   blood pumps in a series configuration within a single device housing.
   This device enables operational switching from the usage of one pump to
   another as needed for clinical management or to support growth and
   development of the pediatric patient. Here, we present the initial
   design where we conducted a virtual fit study, the Taguchi Design
   Optimization Method, iterative design to develop pump geometries.
   Computational tools were used to estimate the pressure generation,
   capacity delivery, hydraulic efficiency, fluid stress levels, exposure
   time to stresses, blood damage index, and fluid forces on the impellers.
   Prototypes of the pumps were tested in a flow loop using a
   water-glycerin solution. Both designs demonstrated the capability to
   generate target pressures and flows. Blood damage estimations were below
   threshold levels and achieved design requirements; however, maximum
   scalar stress levels were above the target limit. Radial and axial
   forces were less than 1 N and 10 N, respectively. The performance data
   trends for physical prototypes correlated with theoretical expectations.
   The centrifugal prototype was able to generate slightly higher pressure
   rises than numerical predictions. In contrast, the axial prototype
   outperformed the computational studies. Experimental data were both
   repeatable and reproducible. The findings from this research are
   promising, and development will continue.}},

Abstract = {{Background: It is important to develop self-management behaviours in
   adolescents to prevent chronic kidney disease progression.
   Objectives: This study evaluates the effect of a self-management program
   that was developed based on individual and family self-management theory
   to aid adolescents with chronic kidney disease in the acquisition of
   competencies in the management of their disease.
   Design: This is a randomized controlled study.
   Participants: The study was conducted with 20 intervention and 20
   control patients, who were treated at two hospitals in Ankara between
   December 2018 and May 2019.
   Measurements: Self-Management Assessment Form, Paediatric Quality of
   Life Inventory-Adolescent Form and clinical parameters. A training
   program, specific to chronic kidney disease, was administered over three
   sessions in a group training setting when the patients came to the
   clinic for follow-up. After the training program was completed, the
   patients were monitored for three months through home visits once every
   two weeks, totalling six visits.
   Results: Following the application of self-management training, a
   statistically significant difference was found self-management knowledge
   and behaviours, quality of life and anxiety mean scores of intervention
   and control group (p <.05), a significant decrease in only blood urea
   nitrogen among the clinical parameters when compared to the control
   group.
   Conclusions: In this study, a self-management training program was
   developed based on Individual and Family Self-Management Theory, aiming
   to have a positive effect on the self-management behaviours of
   adolescents in the cognitive and psychosocial domains.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Tissue analysis using histopathological images is the most prevailing as
   well as a challenging task in the treatment of cancer. The clinical
   assessment of tissues becomes very tough as high variability in the
   magnification levels makes the situation worst for any pathologist to
   deal with the benign and malignant stages of cancer. One of the possible
   ways to address such a pathetic situation could be an advanced machine
   learning approach. Hence, a convolutional neural network (CNN)
   architecture is proposed to create an automated system for magnification
   independent multi-classification of breast cancer histopathological
   images. This automated system offers high productivity and consistency
   in diagnosing the eight different classes of breast cancer from a
   balanced BreakHis dataset. The system utilises an efficient training
   methodology to learn the discerning features from images of different
   magnification levels. Data augmentation techniques are also employed to
   overcome the problem of overfitting. Additionally, the performance of
   CNN architecture has been improved in a significant manner by adopting
   an appropriate pooling strategy and optimisation technique. Based on
   that, we have achieved an accuracy of 80.76\%, 76.58\%, 79.90\%, and
   74.21\% at the magnification 40X, 100X, 200X, and 400X, respectively.
   The proposed model outperforms the handcrafted approaches with an
   average accuracy of 80.47\% at 40X magnification level.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Catheter ablation (CA) for atrial fibrillation (AF) can be
   associated with a risk of thromboembolism and bleeding. We recently
   demonstrated that uninterrupted edoxaban with one dose delayed on the CA
   procedural day is associated with a low risk of periprocedural
   complications. Previous reports have indicated that some specific
   subgroups of patients undergoing CA have an increased risk of bleeding
   and thromboembolic complications. This subanalysis of the KYU-RABLE
   study assessed the changes in plasma concentrations of edoxaban and
   coagulation biomarkers during the periprocedural period of CA in
   subgroups stratified by the risk of thromboembolism assessed by CHADS(2)
   score (<2 or >= 2) and AF type (paroxysmal AF {[}PAF] or non-PAF).
   Methods: We evaluated changes in plasma concentrations of edoxaban and
   coagulation biomarkers (D-dimer and prothrombin fragment F1 + 2), by
   subgroup, during the periprocedural period of CA. Measurements were made
   prior to CA (procedure day).
   Results: This subanalysis evaluated data from 343 patients with CHADS(2)
   score <2 and 134 patients with CHADS(2) score >= 2, and from 280
   patients with PAF and 197 with non-PAF. Plasma edoxaban concentration
   decreased with time on the day of CA, while plasma concentrations of
   coagulation biomarkers remained unchanged. No significant differences
   were observed according to CHADS(2) score or type of AF.
   Conclusions: The changes in plasma concentrations of edoxaban and
   coagulation biomarkers in each subgroup were similar to those of the
   whole analysis, regardless of the thromboembolic risk (CHADS(2) <2 or >=
   2) or AF type (PAF or non-PAF).}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the effects of focus of attention (FOA) instructions

   and transfer tests 10 days later. FOA strategies did not significantly
   benefit dart throwing learning or performance. QED was associated with
   performance in the transfer task, and pupillary constriction occurred
   during the QED. The content of FOA instructions may have limited
   anticipated performance benefits and reduced the FOA influence on QED.
   Pupillary constriction reflected increased cognitive effort during QED,

Abstract = {{Recently, N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are explored as anchor groups
   to bind organic ligands to colloidal gold (i.e. gold nanoparticles, Au
   NPs), yet these efforts are confined to non-conjugated ligands so
   far-that is, focused solely on exploiting the stability aspect. Using
   NHCs to link Au NPs and electronically active organic components, for
   example, conjugated polymers (CPs), will allow capitalizing on both the
   stability as well as the inherent conductivity of the NHC anchors. Here,
   we report three types of Br-NHC-Au-X (X=Cl, Br) complexes, which, when
   used as starting points for Kumada polymerizations, yield regioregular
   poly(3-hexylthiophenes)-NHC-Au (P3HTs-NHC-Au) with narrow molecular
   weight distributions. The corresponding NPs are obtained via direct
   reduction and show excellent thermal as well as redox stability. The NHC
   anchors enable electron delocalization over the gold/CP interface,
   resulting in an improved electrochromic response behavior in comparison
   with P3HT-NHC-Au.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Studies have thus far neglected to evaluate the impact of
   the da Vinci single port (SP) robotic platform on surgeon experience and
   operating room efficiency. We sought to assess the effect of the SP
   platform on surgeon cognitive load measures during robotic assisted
   laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP).
   Methods: We prospectively compared the first 20 SP-RALPs performed at
   our institution to 20 multi-port (MP)-RALPs performed by a single
   experienced robotic surgeon. Three multi-dimensional assessment tools
   were used to evaluate mental and surgical workload, teamwork and
   workflow disruptions.
   Results: No statistically significant differences were found between the
   MP-RALP and SP-RALP cohorts when evaluated by NASA Task Load Index,
   Surgery Task Load Index and Observational Teamwork Assessments.
   Conclusions: The SP robotic platform did not adversely affect human
   factor performance of the surgeon during RALP. Multi-institutional
   validation will be necessary to confirm these initial findings.}},

Title = {{Comparative study of game-based learning on preschoolers' English
   vocabulary acquisition in Taiwan}},
Journal = {{INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS}},
Abstract = {{This is a comparative study that explores preschoolers' English
   vocabulary acquisition in Taiwan and tries to look for a better
   pedagogy. After Taiwan's government announced the policy of developing a
   ``Bilingual Nation,{''} English is the second language in Taiwan. The
   reforming of English instruction is in urgent need. Under this
   background, this research aims to investigate whether English vocabulary
   acquisition will occur in a variety of GBL. In this study, we grouped
   participants into four instructional groups. Two groups are designed as
   instructional groups of ``flashcard game{''} in learning 2 words or 3
   words per day. Another two groups are designed as groups of ``driving
   games{''} in learning 2 words or 3 words per day. Without explicit
   instruction, the study's result showed that preschoolers' English
   vocabulary acquisition can occur autonomously by GBL, and ``2 words per
   day{''} is the best and suitable vocabulary size for preschoolers to
   acquire English in their memory. We found that games can produce
   children's autonomous learning, and the numbers of children's vocabulary
   memory can be taken into consideration. Besides, the appropriate amount
   of information can train children to enter long-term memory. The above
   findings will benefit language learning, game-based learning (GBL), and
   interactive learning.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives We aimed to validate a Spanish version of the Sleep-Related
   Breathing Disorder scale of the Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (SRBD-PSQ)
   in children living in a high-altitude Colombian city.
   Methods In a prospective cohort validation study, patients aged between
   2 and 17 years who attended the Ear, Nose, and Throat pediatric
   department of our institution for symptoms related to sleep-related
   breathing disorders had a baseline visit at enrollment, a second visit
   the day scheduled for the surgical intervention, and a follow-up visit
   at least 3 months after the surgical intervention. In these three
   visits, we gathered the necessary data for assessing the criterion
   validity, construct validity, test-retest reliability, internal
   consistency, and sensitivity to change of the Spanish version of the
   SRBD-PSQ.
   Results In total, 121 patients were included in the analyses. The
   exploratory factor analysis (generalized least squares method, varimax
   rotation) yielded a four-factor structure, explaining 65.93\% of the
   cumulative variance. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of the
   measurements was 0.887 (95\% CI: 0.809-0.934), and the Lin concordance
   correlation coefficient was 0.882 (95\% CI, 0.821-0.943). SRBD-PSQ
   scores at baseline were significantly higher than those obtained after
   adenotonsillectomy surgery (median {[}IQR] 11.0 {[}9.0- 14.0] vs. 4.00
   {[}1.50-7.0]; p < 0.0001). Cronbach's alpha was 0.7055 for the
   questionnaire as a whole.
   Conclusions The Spanish version of the SRBD-PSQ has acceptable construct
   validity, excellent test-retest reliability and sensitivity to change,
   and adequate internal consistency-reliability when used in pediatric
   patients living at high altitude with symptoms related to sleep-related
   breathing disorders.}},

Title = {{Prediction of the RFID Identification Rate Based on the Neighborhood
   Rough Set and Random Forest for Robot Application Scenarios}},
Journal = {{COMPLEXITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{DEC 29}},
Abstract = {{With the rapid development of Internet of Things technology, RFID
   technology has been widely used in various fields. In order to optimize
   the RFID system hardware deployment strategy and improve the deployment
   efficiency, the prediction of the RFID system identification rate has
   become a new challenge. In this paper, a neighborhood rough set and
   random forest (NRS-RF) combination model is proposed to predict the
   identification rate of an RFID system. Firstly, the initial influencing
   factors of the RFID system identification rate are reduced using
   neighborhood rough set theory combined with the principle of heuristic
   attribute reduction of neighborhood weighted dependency, thus obtaining
   a kernel factor subset. Secondly, a random forest prediction model is
   established based on the kernel factor subset, and a confusion matrix is
   established using out-of-bag (OOB) data to evaluate the prediction
   results. The test is conducted under the constructed RFID experimental
   environment, whose results showed that the model can predict the
   identification rate of the RFID system in a fast and efficient way, and
   the classification accuracy can reach 90.5\%. It can effectively guide
   the hardware deployment and communication parameter protocol setting of
   the system and improve the system performance. Compared with BP neural
   network (BPNN) and other prediction models, NRS-RF has shorter
   prediction time and faster calculation speed. Finally, the validity of
   the proposed model was verified by the RFID intelligent archives
   management platform.}},

Title = {{Inductive and synergistic interactions between plant allelochemical
   flavone and Bt toxin Cry1Ac in Helicoverpa armigera}},
Journal = {{INSECT SCIENCE}},
Abstract = {{Genetically engineered crops simultaneously produce defensive
   allelochemicals and Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxin proteins to kill
   some of the world's most devastating insect pests. How the two types of
   toxins, when ingested sequentially or simultaneously, interact at both
   lethal and sublethal doses in these pests remains underexplored. Here,
   we examined the toxicological interactions between the Bt toxin Cry1Ac
   and the flavonoid allelochemical flavone in Helicoverpa armigera.
   Simultaneous exposure of H. armigera neonates to lethal doses (LC25) of
   Cry1Ac and flavone caused a mortality significantly higher than that of
   either toxin alone and their expected additive mortality. Preexposure
   for 24 h to a sublethal dose (LC10) of Cry1Ac followed by 6-d
   simultaneous exposure to the same dose of Cry1Ac plus a lethal dose (1.6
   mg/g diets, LC50) of flavone resulted in a mortality significantly
   higher than that of the LC50 dose of flavone alone and the expected
   additive mortality of the LC50 dose of flavone plus the LC10 dose of
   Cry1Ac. One-day preexposure to the sublethal dose (LC10) of flavone
   followed by 6-d simultaneous exposure to the LC50 dose (6 ng/cm(2)) of
   Cry1Ac plus the LC10 dose of flavone yielded a mortality significantly
   higher than that of the LC50 dose of Cry1Ac but similar to the expected
   additive mortality of the LC50 dose of Cry1Ac plus the LC10 dose of
   flavone. The results suggest that Cry1Ac induces and synergizes the
   toxicity of flavone against H. armigera larvae.}},

Title = {{Influence of climatic stress on nonmetric sexually dimorphic features of
   the skull and pelvis}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN BIOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Objectives Human sexual dimorphism is frequently assessed through skull
   and pelvic size and shape. Researchers suggest that climatic variation
   and the associated stress may be significant factors in sexual
   dimorphism's etiology. However, little research has specifically
   investigated climatic effects on nonmeteric skeletal indicators of sex.
   To further appreciate the plasticity of human biology, a comparative
   study of standard skull and pelvic nonmetric sex indicators is
   presented.
   Methods A Native Alaskan archeological sample (n = 104) and a component
   of the Terry collection (n = 99) represent populations originating from
   different climatic environments in recent history. These sex-balanced
   groups are compared through Tukey-Kramer's method and Greene's t-test to
   determine any variation in degree of sexual dimorphism within and
   between samples.
   Results The results reinforce the complex and multifaceted relationship
   between climate and sexual dimorphism. The Terry sample demonstrated a
   greater degree of sexual dimorphism with statistically significant
   differences in robusticity of the mastoid process and nuchal crest
   compared with the Native Alaskans. A more ``male{''} morphotype and
   reduced dimorphism are appreciated in the pelves of Native Alaskans than
   the Terry sample.
   Conclusions This research highlights a reduction in sexual dimorphism in
   populations under greater climatic stress and contributes to the
   production of more accurate skeletal assessments in future
   investigations. Discussion of confounding factors suggest more research

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{As a promising candidate for large-scale energy storage, sodium-ion
   batteries (SIBs) have superiority due to their low cost and abundance as
   a resource. Herein, homogeneous Sb2Se3 nanocrystallites embedded in
   carbon nanofibers (Sb2Se3/CNFs) by electrospinning and selenization
   treatment are prepared. The obtained Sb2Se3/CNFs exhibit good cycling
   performance, high reversible capacity, and excellent rate capability as
   anodes for SIBs. The outstanding performances are attributed to a
   combination of Na+ intercalation, conversion reaction, and alloying with
   Sb2Se3, disclosed through in-situ X-ray diffraction. Meanwhile, unique
   nanostructures provide large contact surface and tolerant accommodation
   to volume expansion which bring high reversibility and long cycle
   durability. This distinctive material shows prospective applications of
   SIBs especially under high current density.}},

Abstract = {{The development of flow control methods in the centrifugal pump relies
   on further understanding of the characteristics of vortex structures and
   their irreversible losses. In this paper, the detached eddy simulation
   is conducted on a model centrifugal pump, which shows a good agreement
   with the experiment. Combining with three generations of vortex
   identification methods (vorticity, Q criterion, omega and Liutex
   methods) and entropy production analysis, the results show omega and
   Liutex methods are highly recommended to analyze the vortex structures.
   Vorticity is the key factor to promote the energy dissipation, and the
   irreversible losses of vortex areas can be lower than their surroundings
   when there exists smaller vorticity or higher rotation strength.
   Concerning the pressure pulsation induced by vortex shedding, it is
   unreasonable to analyze this unsteady process via vortex structures
   identified by iso-surface because of the restriction of the threshold.
   In comparison, the change of integral length is more related to the
   pressure pulsation.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents an optimal configuration of a hybrid renewable
   energy source with a wind turbine and a photovoltaic system to fulfil
   the required electricity power of a medium-size workshop in an
   industrial area in Ardabil, Iran. The paper presents a technoeconomic
   analysis for achieving the least-cost configuration using historic data
   from supply and demand sides. The results show that due to the windy
   climatic conditions in the studied area, a large percentage of the
   generated energy is supplied by wind energy resources. Eight feasible
   configurations including Diesel, Diesel/Battery, PV/Diesel /Battery,
   Wind/Diesel/Battery, PV/Wind/Diesel/Battery, PV/Diesel, Wind/Diesel, and
   PV/Wind/ Diesel are considered in hourly-based simulations. Energy cost
   is calculated for different conditions. The results show that the
   integration of 13 kW diesel generator, 1 kW PV array, 2 numbers of 3 kW
   wind turbine, 6.13 kW converter and 27 strings of 1 kW lead-acid
   batteries storage bank is the best configuration that leads to the

Abstract = {{We present an investigation on the controlled growth of epitaxial iron
   telluride films of multiple phases by molecular beam epitaxy. By
   optimizing the substrate temperature, we fabricate different phases of
   alpha-FeTe, beta-FeTe, and FeTe2, respectively, whose crystalline
   morphologies are determined by means of in situ scanning tunneling
   microscopy/spectroscopy and ex situ scanning transmission electron
   microscopy. While both alpha- and beta-FeTe films are metallic, we
   uncover a similar to 185- and 65-mV semiconducting band gap for the
   (100) and (011) facets of FeTe2 film, respectively, with the former one
   being compatible with the first principles calculations. Moreover, for
   FeTe2, we observe reduced gaps with enhanced conductance in the vicinity
   of edge boundaries, which are dependent on the geometries of step
   orientation and possibly in correlation to the magnetic anisotropy with
   structural distortion. Our study provides insight into the controllable
   synthesis of Fe-Te compounds with variation of stoichiometries and
   surface terminations, which may generalize to other epitaxial Fe
   chalcogenide films.}},

Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{129}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Background This study investigated p16 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on
   cellblocks (CBs) and human papillomavirus (HPV) by polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) in fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of head and neck squamous
   cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
   Methods Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used
   to assess test performance in CBs compared with p16 IHC in 42 surgical
   specimens from patients with HNSCC and in correlation with HPV by PCR in
   cytology specimens. The study assessed HPV by PCR in FNA specimens as a
   substitute for p16 IHC in surgical specimens.
   Results Of 42 cases, 38 CBs showed malignant cells as cohesive clusters
   of viable cells with or without single tumor cells, whereas 4 specimens
   were composed exclusively of single tumor cells and degenerated cells.
   All p16-negative surgical specimens showed an absence of p16 staining in
   the corresponding CBs (n = 16). In the p16-positive surgical cases (n =
   26), corresponding CBs with tumor clusters (n = 23) showed heterogeneous
   p16 expression ranging from 40\% to 100\%; however, scoring single cells
   was challenging and unreliable because of cellular degradation. ROC
   curve inspection showed the optimal threshold to be at least 40\% p16
   staining in tumor clusters with 100\% sensitivity and specificity. In
   cases with inadequate CBs, HPV by PCR on needle rinse showed 88\%
   sensitivity and 100\% specificity for p16 expression in surgical
   specimens.
   Conclusions A cutoff of at least 40\% p16 expression in tumor clusters
   may be appropriate for p16 positivity in cytology CB specimens. A
   positive HPV finding by PCR on needle rinse can be used as a substitute
   for p16 expression in surgical specimens.}},

Abstract = {{Efficiency analysis of the Partner Organizations can benefit all the
   microfinance sector's key stakeholders to benchmark the current scene
   and formulate optimal policy agenda. This study seeks to measure the
   partner organizations of the Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund's social
   and financial efficiency and to identify causes and sources of their
   inefficiencies. A non-parametric technique known as Data Envelopment
   Analysis is applied to investigate the Partner Organizations' efficiency
   throughout 2005-2015. The required data was obtained from the database
   of the Mix-Market and Pakistan Microfinance Network. The social and
   financial efficiency was estimated assuming Constant Return to Scale,
   Variable Return to Scale, and with respect to the Operational Scale of
   the Partner Organizations. Results revealed that the partner
   organizations are more scale efficient (median = 75\%) than pure
   technically efficient (median = 55\%). Further, graphical
   representations show a decreasing linear trend and negative serial
   correlation in the percentage of efficient partner organizations. The
   model fit results show that institutional characteristics that influence
   partner organizations' efficiencies significantly include their age,
   Operational Self-Sufficiency, personnel, loan officers, assets and debt.
   Finally, the diagnostic tests for endogeneity, heteroskedasticity,
   heterogeneity, and cross-sectional dependence were performed.}},

Abstract = {{The therapeutic applications of regulatory T cells (T-regs) include
   treating autoimmune diseases, graft-versus-host disease and induction of
   transplantation tolerance. For ex-vivo expanded T-regs to be used in
   deceased donor transplantation, they must be able to suppress T cell
   responses to a broad range of human leukocyte antigen (HLA). Here, we
   present a novel approach for the expansion of polyspecific T-regs in
   cynomolgus macaques that was adapted from a good manufacturing
   practice-compliant protocol. T-regs were isolated by
   fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and expanded in the presence
   of a panel of CD40L-stimulated B cells (CD40L-sBc). Prior to T-reg
   culture, CD40L-sBc were expanded in vitro from multiple major
   histocompatibility complex (MHC)-disparate macaques. Expanded T-regs
   expressed high levels of forkhead box protein 3 (FoxP3) and Helios, a
   high percentage of T-reg-specific demethylated region (TSDR)
   demethylation and strong suppression of naive T cell responses in vitro.
   In addition, these T-regs produced low levels of inflammatory cytokines
   and were able to expand post-cryopreservation. Specificity assays
   confirmed that these T-regs were suppressive upon activation by any
   antigen-presenting cells (APCs) whose MHC was shared by CD40L-sBc used
   during expansion, proving that they are polyspecific. We developed an
   approach for the expansion of highly suppressive cynomolgus macaque
   polyspecific T-regs through the use of a combination of CD40L-engineered
   B cells with the potential to be translated to clinical studies. To our
   knowledge, this is the first report that uses a pool of MHC-mismatched
   CD40L-sBc to create polyspecific T-regs suitable for use in
   deceased-donor transplants.}},

   Five sets of tests were performed. Corrosion vulnerability of various
   diameters, temperature and pH effect on the corrosion process, potential
   corrosion tendency after a precorrosion period and declination from the
   theoretical damage prediction model are some of the parameters examined
   Findings The results of the tests provide useful information on the main
   parameters, determining the quality of the corrosion damage.
   Originality/value The originality of the present study is the fact that

   grooves to the star gear cylindrical roller bearing has a significant
   impact in reducing the temperature of the inner ring, and annular
   grooves with different cross-sectional sizes have different impacts in
   reducing the temperature of the inner ring. When the cross-sectional
   area of the annular grooves is 5 x 1.5 mm, the temperatures of the inner

Month = {{DEC 28}},
Abstract = {{Over the last decades, photoreceptive proteins were extensively studied
   with biophysical methods to gain a fundamental understanding of their
   working mechanisms and further guide the development of optogenetic
   tools. Time-resolved infrared (IR) spectroscopy is one of the key
   methods to access their functional non-equilibrium processes with high
   temporal resolution but has the major drawback that experimental data
   are usually highly complex. Linking the spectral response to specific
   molecular events is a major obstacle. Here, we investigate a
   cyanobacteriochrome photoreceptor with a combined approach of transient
   absorption spectroscopy in the visible and IR spectral regions. We
   obtain kinetic information in both spectral regions by analysis with two
   different fitting methods: global multiexponential fitting and lifetime
   analysis. We investigate the ground state dynamics that follow
   photoexcitation in both directions of the bi-stable photocycle (Pr-{*}
   and Pg({*})) in the nanosecond and microsecond time regimes. We find two
   ground state intermediates associated with the decay of Pr-{*} and four
   with Pg({*}) and report the macroscopic time constants of their
   interconversions. One of these processes is assigned to a structural
   change in the protein backbone.}},

Abstract = {{A procedure for electroanalytical determination of the fungicide TBZ
   extracted and preconcentrated from tomatoes by the cloud-point
   extraction (CPE) technique was developed and validated in this work. The
   analytical technique used for this determination was HPLC coupled to an
   electrochemical detector (HPLC/EC), with a BDD electrode. The main
   variables of the CPE process were evaluated using a 2(4) full factorial
   design. The optimal condition of CPE was achieved by using Tergitol
   (19\% v/v), NaCl (0.83 g), ultrasonic stirring time of 15 min and a
   temperature of 36 degrees C. Under these conditions, the
   preconcentration factor obtained was 5.7. The limits of detection (LOD)
   and quantification (LOQ) were 2.7 x 10(-8) mol L-1 (or 5.4 mu g L-1) and
   5.5 x 10(-8) mol L-1 (or 11 mu g L-1), respectively. The average
   recovery values varied from 80.7\% to 115.1\% and the precision (average
   of 3 days) was less than 15\%, indicating the good accuracy and
   precision of the method developed here. Upon applying the method to
   examine commercial tomatoes, TBZ was detected in one of the three
   analyzed samples.}},

   characterized by atrial remodeling. Complement C1q tumor necrosis
   factor-related protein 3 (CTRP3) is one of the adipokines associated
   with obesity, diabetes, and coronary heart disease. The association
   between plasma CTRP3 levels and AF is uncertain. The aim of this study
   was to investigate whether plasma CTRP3 concentrations were correlated
   with AF. Our study included 75 AF patients who underwent catheter
   ablation at our hospital and 47 sinus rhythm patients to determine the
   difference in plasma CTRP3 concentrations. Blood samples before the
   ablation were collected, and ELISA was used to measure the
   concentrations of CTRP3. Plasma CTRP3 concentrations were significantly
   lower in AF patients compared with control group (366.9 +/- 105.2 ng/ml
   vs. 429.1 +/- 100.1 ng/ml, p=0.002). In subgroup studies, patients with
   persistent AF had lower plasma CTRP3 concentrations than those with
   paroxysmal AF (328.3 +/- 83.3 ng/ml vs. 380.0 +/- 109.2 ng/ml, p=0.037).
   The concentrations of plasma CTRP3 in the recurrence group after
   radiofrequency catheter ablation of AF were lower than those in the
   nonrecurrence group (337.9 +/- 77.3 ng/ml vs. 386.6 +/- 108.1 ng/ml,
   p=0.045). Multivariate regression analysis revealed the independent
   correlation between plasma CTRP3 level and AF. Plasma CTRP3
   concentrations were correlated with the presence of AF and AF
   recurrence.}},

Title = {{Fine structures of acoustic emission spectra: How to separate
   dislocation movements and entanglements in 316L stainless steel}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{26}},

Abstract = {{Intermittent avalanches in a multitude of materials are characterized by
   acoustic emission, AE, where local events lead to strain relaxations and
   generate shock waves (so-called ``jerks{''}), which are measured at the
   sample surface. The bane of this approach is that several avalanche
   mechanisms may contribute to the same AE spectrum so that a detailed
   analysis of each individual contribution becomes virtually impossible.
   It is, hence, essential to develop tools to separate signals from
   different dynamical processes, such as ferroic domain switching,
   collapse of porous inclusions, dislocation movements, entanglements, and
   so on. Particularly, difficult cases are dynamical microstructures in
   fcc alloys where the AE signal strength is weak. Nevertheless, using
   profile analysis of AE signals, we can distinguish between two
   mechanisms, namely, dislocation movements and dynamic entanglements in
   fcc 316L stainless steel. In this approach, we are able to measure the
   statistical AE durations of both subsets separately. The fingerprint for
   superposed avalanches with different durations is seen by the scaling
   between the energy E and the maximum amplitude A of each avalanche E
   similar to A(x) with x=2. While the same exponent x applies for both
   mechanisms, the scaling relation shows two branches with different
   absolute energy values. The two mechanisms are then confirmed by
   separating the energy distributions P(E) similar to E-epsilon for the
   two mechanisms with epsilon =1.55 for dislocation movements and epsilon
   =1.36 for entanglements.}},

Number = {{26}},
Month = {{DEC 28}},
Abstract = {{Modulation doping is a commonly adopted technique to create
   two-dimensional (2D) electrons or holes in semiconductor
   heterostructures. One constraint, however, is that the intentional
   dopants required for modulation doping are controlled and incorporated
   during the growth of heterostructures. Using undoped strained germanium
   quantum wells as the model material system, we show, in this work, that
   modulation doping can be achieved post-growth of heterostructures by ion
   implantation and dopant-activation anneals. The carrier density is
   controlled ex situ by varying the ion fluence and implant energy, and an
   empirical calibration curve is obtained. While the mobility of the
   resulting 2D holes is lower than that in undoped heterostructure
   field-effect transistors built using the same material, the achievable
   carrier density is significantly higher. Potential applications of this
   modulation-doping technique are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Dye detachment issue in the TiO2-mediated dye-sensitized photocatalytic
   system engenders an electron injection route based on collisional
   quenching between the detached solution-phase dye and dispersed n-type
   TiO2 particles, in addition to the general fast electron injection
   pathway from dye chemisorbed on TiO2. For porphyrin-sensitized
   hetero-binary hybrids prepared by mixing a solution-phase Zn porphyrin
   sensitizer (ZnP) and heterogeneous Re(I) molecular catalyst-immobilized
   TiO2 particles (TiO2/Re(I)), we found that without any dye
   immobilization on the TiO2 surface, the dissolved porphyrin dye can
   effectively transport its excited-state electrons to the heterogeneous
   catalytic TiO2/Re(I) particles via a collisional electron transfer
   pathway, which is relatively unstudied and thus an interesting topic in
   the dye-sensitized semiconductor photocatalytic system. The better
   light-harvesting ability of porphyrin in solution and the TiO2-induced
   stabilization of the molecular Re(I) catalyst raised the photochemical
   CO2-to-CO conversion activity of the semiheterogeneous system (porphyrin
   + TiO2/Re(I) catalyst) above that of the homogeneous system (porphyrin +

Abstract = {{Bismuthene has opened up a new avenue in the field of nanotechnology
   because of its spectacular electronic and thermoelectric features. The
   strong spin-orbit-coupling enables its operation as the largest
   nontrivial bandgap topological insulator and quantum spin hall material
   at room temperature, which is unlikely for any other 2D material. It is
   also known to be the most promising thermoelectric material due to its
   remarkable thermoelectric properties, including a substantially high
   power factor. However, an in-depth understanding of the mechanical and
   thermal transport properties of bismuthene is crucial for its practical
   implementation and efficient operation. Employing the Stillinger-Weber
   potential, we utilized molecular dynamics simulations to inspect the
   mechanical strength and thermal conductivity of the monolayer
   beta-bismuthene for the first time. We analyzed the effect of
   temperature on the tensile mechanical properties along the armchair and
   zigzag directions of bismuthene nanosheets and found that increasing
   temperature causes a significant deterioration in these properties. The
   material shows superior fracture resistance with zigzag loading, whereas
   the armchair direction exhibits an improved elasticity. Next, we showed
   that increasing vacancy concentration and crack length notably reduce
   the fracture stress and strain of beta-bismuthene. Under all these
   conditions, beta-bismuthene showed a strong chirality effect under
   tensile loading. We also explored the fracture phenomena of a
   pre-cracked beta-bismuthene, which reveal that the armchair-directed
   crack possesses a higher fracture resistance than the zigzag-directed
   crack. Interestingly, branching phenomena occurred during crack
   propagation for the armchair crack; meanwhile, the crack propagates
   perpendicular to loading for the zigzag crack. Afterward, we
   investigated the effect of loading rate on the fracture properties of
   bismuthene along the armchair and zigzag directions. Finally, we
   calculated the thermal conductivity of bismuthene under the influence of
   temperature and vacancy and recorded a substantial decrement in thermal
   conductivity with increasing temperature and vacancy. The obtained
   results are comprehensively discussed in the light of phonon density of
   states, phonon dispersion spectrum, and phonon group velocities. It is
   also disclosed that the thermal conductivity of beta-bismuthene is
   considerably lower than that of other analogous honeycomb structures.
   This study can add a new dimension to the successful realization of
   bismuthene in future (opto)electronic, spintronic, and thermoelectric
   devices.}},

Abstract = {{Multiply interacting massive particles (MIMPs) are heavy (> 10(10)

   matter, but may have evaded detection due to the low number density
   required to make up the local dark matter halo. These particles could
   leave tracklike signatures in current experiments, similar to lightly
   ionizing particles. We show that previously calculated limits from the
   MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR on the flux of lightly ionizing particles can be
   used to exclude MIMP dark matter parameter space up to a mass of 10(15)
   GeV/c(2). We also calculate limits from the standard XENON1T analysis in
   this high-mass regime, properly taking into account flux limitations and
   multiscatter effects. Finally, we show that a dedicated MIMP analysis
   using the XENON1T dark matter search could probe unexplored parameter
   space up to masses of 10(18) GeV/c(2).}},

Abstract = {{Phonon-assisted anti-Stokes fluorescence is observed in an Yb3+ doped,
   30 mol\% BaO containing tellurite glass for the first time. Absorption,
   excitation, and the anti-Stokes fluorescence spectra of the glass show a
   phonon progression of 150 cm(-1). The phonon is identified as the
   combined vibrational mode of rocking of the nonbridging oxygen atoms of
   both TeO3- and its dimer Te2O52- units and the bending of the Te-O-Te
   linkage of the Te2O52- units of the glass structure. These units are
   known to exist in plenty in such BaO-TeO2 glasses with high BaO content.
   Association of the phonon modes with the absorption and anti-Stokes
   fluorescence spectra of Yb3+ of the glass, strongly suggests that the
   phonon is coupled both with the F-2(7/2)(1) ground and the F-2(5/2)(5)
   excited states of the ion; and the observed anti-Stokes fluorescence
   originates through annihilation of the excited state manifolds of this
   coupled phonon. Phononics and spectroscopic analysis of the anti-Stokes
   fluorescence process suggest that the material should be prospective for

Title = {{Meaningful work on career satisfaction: a moderated mediation model of
   job embeddedness and work-based social support}},
Journal = {{MANAGEMENT RESEARCH REVIEW}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{889-908}},
Month = {{JUN 21}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   This paper aims to examine a moderated mediation model for answering how
   and why work meaningfulness influences career satisfaction through job
   embeddedness as an intervening mechanism. There is also an investigation
   of how work-based social support from supervisors and co-workers are
   contingent upon such effect.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Data were collected from 1,137 accountants in various disciplines from
   one of the largest corporations in Thailand, including its numerous
   subsidiaries and joint ventures. The hypotheses were tested and analyzed
   by means of structural equation modeling, hierarchical regression and a
   bootstrapping procedure.
   Findings
   The results reveal that the direct relationship between meaningful work
   and career satisfaction was partially mediated by job embeddedness.
   Perceptions of supervisor and co-worker support were found to have
   moderating effects on meaningful work and job embeddedness. However, the
   conditional indirect effect was only confirmed for supervisor support.
   Research limitations/implications
   The generalizability of the findings may be narrow due to the nature of
   the sample, which involved only one occupation. Future research may
   expand the generalizability by considering different vocations, business
   contexts and industries.
   Practical implications
   This study offers important implications to researchers and
   practitioners by highlighting that an integrative model of
   organizational factors should be considered in managing human resources.
   Originality/value
   This research is among the initial attempts to extend relevant knowledge
   in the fields of meaningful work and job embeddedness by identifying
   organizational mechanisms that amplify the structural relationship.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 28}},
Abstract = {{Single-stranded RNA viruses efficiently encapsulate their genome into a
   protein shell called the capsid. Electrostatic interactions between the
   positive charges in the capsid protein's N-terminal tail and the
   negatively charged genome have been postulated as the main driving force
   for virus assembly. Recent experimental results indicate that the
   N-terminal tail with the same number of charges and same lengths
   packages different amounts of RNA, which reveals that electrostatics
   alone cannot explain all the observed outcomes of the RNA self-assembly
   experiments. Using a mean-field theory, we show that the combined effect
   of genome configurational entropy and electrostatics can explain to some
   extent the amount of packaged RNA with mutant proteins where the
   location and number of charges on the tails are altered. Understanding
   the factors contributing to the virus assembly could promote the attempt
   to block viral infections or to build capsids for gene therapy
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Background Dysmotility and postoperative ileus (POI) are major clinical
   problems after surgical trauma and it is associated with increased
   intestinal inflammation and oxidative stress. Despite the high
   occurrence of POI following intra-abdominal surgeries, no effective
   treatment is currently available. Erythropoietin (EPO) is a
   multifunctional tissue-protective cytokine with potent anti-inflammatory
   and anti-oxidative properties, and it is an FDA approved medicine for
   clinical use. While both EPO and EPO receptors (EPOR) are widely
   expressed in the gut, the role of EPO in POI is largely unknown. This
   study was designed to explore the possible beneficial effect of EPO in a
   mouse model of POI.
   Methods Mice were subjected to intestinal manipulation to induce
   standard POI and intestinal transit time was determined at 24-h
   post-injury with or without EPO treatment (5000 units/kg, once, IP,
   immediately after intestinal trauma). Intestinal samples were harvested
   for histological and immunohistochemical analysis.
   Results Systemic EPO significantly improved intestinal transit time
   compared with control group and it was associated with significantly
   increased levels of tissue macrophages and reduced levels of oxidative
   stress.
   Conclusions and Inferences This is the first pre-clinical study to
   document novel beneficial effects of EPO in gut dysmotility and our
   findings suggest that the beneficial effects of EPO in POI is
   predominantly mediated by its anti-oxidative and immunomodulatory
   properties.}},

   Osteotomy: A Propensity Score-Matched Study Based on the German
   Cartilage Registry (KnorpelRegister DGOU)}},
Journal = {{CARTILAGE}},
Abstract = {{Background. Even though realignment procedures have gained popularity as
   concomitant techniques in cartilage repair approaches with underlying
   malalignment, the clinical efficacy has not been proven to full extent.
   Methods. Out of 5474 patients from the German Cartilage Registry, 788
   patients with focal cartilage defects on the medial femoral condyle
   having received either no accompanying surgery or high tibial osteotomy
   (HTO) were identified. After a 1:1 propensity score matching, outcome of
   440 patients was evaluated using KOOS (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis
   Outcome Score), VAS (visual analogue scale), and satisfaction during the
   3-year follow-up. Results. Patients having received a concomitant HTO
   had significantly higher postoperative KOOS values (12 months: 67.26 +/-
   15.69 vs.75.10 +/- 16.12, P = 0.001; 24 months: 67.14 +/- 23.85 vs.
   77.11 +/- 16.50, P = 0.010; 36 months: 74.40 +/- 16.57 vs. 81.75 +/-
   14.22, P = 0.023) and lower pain levels (6 months: 3.43 +/- 2.18 vs.
   2.89 +/- 2.15, P = 0.009; 12 months: 3.64 +/- 2.20 vs. 2.17 +/- 1.96, P
   < 0.001; 24 months: 4.20 +/- 3.12 vs. 2.94 +/- 2.45, P = 0.005; 36
   months: 3.20 +/- 2.18 vs. 2.02 +/- 1.98, P = 0.003). One and 3 years
   postoperatively, concomitant HTO led to significantly higher
   satisfaction in patients. These advantages of accompanying HTO were also
   seen in the group of patients with a varus deformity of 5 degrees or
   more, in which pain levels without concomitant HTO even increased during
   the 3-year follow-up. Conclusion. The results of the present study
   underline the importance and safety of concomitant HTO in patients with
   cartilage defects and varus deformity. HTO should therefore be
   considered and recommended generously in patients with focal cartilage
   defects of the medial femoral condyle and varus deformity.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction ST Genesia is a new automated system enabling quantitative
   standardized evaluation of thrombin generation (TG), for example, in
   patients receiving anti-Xa direct inhibitors (xabans). Data on its
   analytical performances are scarce.
   Methods Over an 18-month period, repeatability, reproducibility, and
   accuracy were assessed using STG-ThromboScreen (without or with
   thrombomodulin) or STG-DrugScreen reagents (corresponding to
   intermediate/high tissue-factor concentration, respectively), and
   controls. Furthermore, reproducibility was assessed using commercialized
   lyophilized and frozen normal pooled plasmas. Rivaroxaban and apixaban
   impacts on TG parameters were assessed using spiking experiments.
   Finally, a comparison with the Calibrated Automated Thrombogram method
   (CAT) (PPP reagent) was performed using plasma from healthy volunteers
   enrolled in the DRIVING-studyNCT 01627665) before and after rivaroxaban
   intake.
   Results For all dedicated quality control (QC) levels, inter-series
   coefficients of variations (CV) were <7\% for temporal TG parameters,
   peak height (PH), and endogenous thrombin potential (ETP), whether
   results were normalized with a dedicated reference plasma STG-RefPlasma
   or not. Noteworthy, STG-RefPlasma used for normalization displayed
   substantially high PH and ETP. Mean biases between the observed and
   manufacturer's assigned QC values were mostly <7\%. Both
   rivaroxaban/apixaban plasma concentrations were significantly associated
   with TG parameters. Finally, Bland-Altman plots showed a good agreement
   between ST Genesia-STG-ThromboScreen and CAT method within the explored
   range of values, although biases could be observed (PH: 16.4 +/- 13.2\%,
   ETP: 17.8 +/- 11.9\%).
   Conclusion ST Genesia(R) enables the reliable measurement of TG
   parameters in both in vitro and ex vivo xaban plasma samples using
   either STG-ThromboScreen or STG-DrugScreen according to xaban
   concentrations. The use of reference plasma, despite not completely
   reflecting a normal pooled plasma behavior, likely improves
   standardization and inter-laboratory comparisons.}},

Title = {{International market selection: an application of hybrid multi-criteria
   decision-making technique in the textile sector}},
Journal = {{REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS AND STRATEGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{127-150}},
Month = {{MAR 19}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   The selection of an international market (IMS) is a prime factor in the
   success and growth of a company. Therefore, the purpose of this study is
   to consolidate and apply a systematic methodology that contributes
   toward the evaluation of international markets and promotes entry into
   the export market of Antioquia's textile companies.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Through a systematic literature review, the criteria and sub-criteria
   involved in the IMS process are identified and a total of 5 general
   criteria and 23 sub-criteria are selected. A hybrid approach is used to
   address the gap. In total, a multiple case study of 11 companies from
   different range of export values are selected. Data analysis is
   conducted using two multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) models,
   namely, the analytic hierarchy process for weighting the factors and the
   technique for order of preference by similarity to the ideal solution
   for the country selection ranking.
   Findings
   The results demonstrate the applicability of the hybrid MCDM technique
   to improve IMS decision-making in the textile sector and other sectors.
   It is found that Canada, Belgium and the UK are the best destinations
   for textile exports with a selection score of 0.7716, 0.7488 and 0.7337,
   respectively. The sub-criteria belonging to the dimensions of trade
   barriers, economic factors and costs are the main factors affecting the
   export of a textile-clothing product.
   Research limitations/implications
   The possibility of achieving a generalized result through this case
   study is not possible, but the methodological application carried out is
   a novel for the selection of markets in the Colombian case and within
   the literature available in the domain.
   Practical implications
   From the managerial point of view, firms associated with trade have a
   broader vision when looking for new markets. Emerging entrepreneurs can
   equip themselves to enter the international market. Practitioners and
   policymakers can also use this methodology, which will allow them to
   evaluate new markets to outline promotional strategies for positioning
   products abroad.
   Social implications
   To facilitate the selection of international markets for enterprises.
   Originality/value
   The contribution of the study is twofold. First, the combination of
   techniques will allow wider support for the selection of markets and act
   as a decision support system. On the other hand, this is the first time
   that such a methodology is used for IMS in the exporting sector not only
   in Colombia but also in Latin America. Finally, the detailed
   methodological process described in the study allows both academicians
   and decision-makers to replicate the study in other contexts and
   scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{The present work demonstrates high potential of Parachlorella kessleri
   IC-11 microalga biomass for the production of biogenic formic acid under
   hydrothermal conditions and an air atmosphere. Homogeneous and
   heterogeneous catalytic approaches were applied and compared. The
   experiments were carried out in the presence of soluble H5PMo10V2O40 and
   solid {[}(C4H9)(4)N](3).5H0.5PMo11VO40 bifunctional catalysts. The
   influence of reaction temperature and catalyst loading on the formic
   acid formation was revealed. Experimental data demonstrated that the
   microalgae biomass transformation to formic acid was limited by biomass
   depolymerization and hydrolysis processes, not the oxidation of
   intermediates to formic acid. H5PMo10V2O40 allowed for formic acid to be
   obtained with better yields compared to
   {[}(C4H9)(4)N](3.5)H0.5PMo11VO40. Yields of 49 and 30 wt \% of the
   target product were achieved over H5PMo10V2O40 and
   {[}(C4H9)(4)N](3.5)H0.5PMo11VO40, respectively. The solid catalyst
   demonstrated high stability in seven runs of the reaction at least while
   the activity of soluble heteropoly acid declined in the fifth reaction

Abstract = {{Background: The estimation of microbial networks can provide important
   insight into the ecological relationships among the organisms that
   comprise the microbiome. However, there are a number of critical
   statistical challenges in the inference of such networks from
   high-throughput data. Since the abundances in each sample are
   constrained to have a fixed sum and there is incomplete overlap in
   microbial populations across subjects, the data are both compositional
   and zero-inflated.
   Results: We propose the COmpositional Zero-Inflated Network Estimation
   (COZINE) method for inference of microbial networks which addresses
   these critical aspects of the data while maintaining computational
   scalability. COZINE relies on the multivariate Hurdle model to infer a
   sparse set of conditional dependencies which reflect not only
   relationships among the continuous values, but also among binary
   indicators of presence or absence and between the binary and continuous
   representations of the data. Our simulation results show that the
   proposed method is better able to capture various types of microbial
   relationships than existing approaches. We demonstrate the utility of
   the method with an application to understanding the oral microbiome
   network in a cohort of leukemic patients.
   Conclusions: Our proposed method addresses important challenges in
   microbiome network estimation, and can be effectively applied to
   discover various types of dependence relationships in microbial
   communities. The procedure we have developed, which we refer to as
   COZINE, is available online at https://github.com/MinJinHa/COZINE..}},

Abstract = {{Advances in video technology enable new strategies for stream fish
   research. We compared juvenile (age-0) and adult (age-1 and older) Brook
   Trout Salvelinus fontinalis abundance estimates from underwater video
   with those from backpack electrofishing and dive count methods across a
   series of stream pools in Shenandoah National Park, Virginia (n = 41).
   Video methods estimated greater mean abundance of adult trout than did
   one-pass electrofishing, but video estimates of adult abundance were not
   different than estimates from three-pass electrofishing or dive count
   methods. In contrast, videos underestimated the abundance of juvenile
   trout; we suggest that this is because predator avoidance behaviors by
   juvenile trout limit their use of microhabitat locations visible to
   cameras. Integrated abundance estimates from two cameras increased
   correspondence to comparison methods relative to estimates from single
   cameras, demonstrating the importance of an expanded field of view for
   video sampling in streams. Geomorphic features helped to explain
   methodwise differences: more adult Brook Trout were estimated with video
   than with three-pass electrofishing as riffle crest depth and boulder
   composition increased, indicating habitat associations with trout
   escapement from electrofishing. Our results demonstrated that video
   techniques can provide a robust alternative or supplement to traditional
   methods for estimating adult trout abundance in stream pools.}},

   follow-up time of about 4 center dot 7 years) from the Healthy Aging in
   Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study with a genetic
   risk score for AD (hAlzScore). The Healthy Eating Index-2010, Dietary

   baseline (2004-2009) and follow-up visits (2009-2013) were used to
   assess initial DQ and change over time. Linear mixed-effects regression
   models were utilised, adjusting for select covariates, selection bias
   and multiple testing. DQ change (Delta DQ) was associated with
   California Verbal Learning Test-List A - overall (0 center dot 15 (se 0
   center dot 06), P = 0 center dot 008) and in women (0 center dot 21 (se
   0 center dot 08), P = 0 center dot 006), at highest AD risk, indicating
   protective effects over time. Greater AD risk was longitudinally
   associated with poorer Clock Command Test scores in men. Poor DQ was
   positively and cross-sectionally associated with Trails B scores, but in
   women only. Better-quality diet was associated with a slower decline in
   verbal memory among AA women, with greater AD risk. Insufficient
   clinical evidence and/or mixed findings dictate that more studies are
   needed to investigate brain morphology and volume changes in relation to
   DQ in an at-risk population for AD, over time.}},

Abstract = {{Herein, a side chain engineered polythiophene copolymer based organic
   semiconductor polymer (OSP) with pendant aldehyde groups was synthesized
   by a combination of Grignard Metathesis (GRIM) polymerization and
   post-synthetic modifications. The pendant aldehyde groups of OSP
   (electron donor-D) were covalently conjugated to the pristine C-60
   (elector acceptor-A) via 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction (i.e., Prato
   reaction) between the pristine C-60 and azomethine ylide formed in situ
   as a result of the reaction of pendant aldehyde groups and sarcosine.
   The OSP with pendant aldehyde groups and its covalent conjugate with
   pristine C-60 were fully characterized using FTIR and H-1-NMR
   spectroscopies. Fluorescence spectroscopic analysis of the synthesized
   D-A double cable covalent hybrid and physical hybrid derived from the
   physical mixing of the synthesized OSP and C-60 revealed a higher
   fluorescence quenching in the case of the covalent hybrid. This novel
   precisely designed D-A hybrid material was employed as the photoactive
   layer in an interdigitated gold electrode based photodetector where a
   significant enhancement in photocurrent (>2.5 times) was observed in the
   devices consisting of photoactive layer derived from the D-A covalent
   hybrid. This work offers a step forward in the systematic development of
   D-A covalent hybrids with a precise molecular design to fabricate
   efficient photovoltaic devices.}},

Journal = {{PAIN RESEARCH \& MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{DEC 28}},
Abstract = {{Background. The aim of this study was to confirm the effectiveness of
   open-label placebo (OLP) in Japanese patients with chronic low back pain
   (CLBP), similar to previous reports, and to investigate its short- and
   medium-term effects in this study population. Methods. Fifty-two
   patients with CLBP were randomized into a treatment as usual (TAU) group
   (n = 26) or an OLP + TAU group (n = 26) for 12 weeks. The TAU included
   advice to remain active and exercise in conjunction with recent
   psychological education based on a self-management strategy. In
   contrast, participants in the OLP + TAU group were instructed to take
   two OLP capsules a day. Outcome measures were assessed at baseline and
   at weeks 3 and 12 using the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire
   (RMDQ), Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) for pain intensity, and the
   Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG) test. Difference in outcomes between the two
   groups was compared at the two follow-up points. Results. Although all
   participants completed the 3-week follow-up, four patients (two in each
   group) were lost to follow-up beyond week 3. There were no significant
   intergroup differences in changes in the RMDQ score (p=0.40), pain-NRS
   score (p=0.19), and TUG time (p=0.98) at week 3. Two-way repeated
   measure analyses of covariance showed significant time-course effects
   but did not show group effects or any interactions between the
   time-course and group in terms of the RMDQ score. However, it did not
   show any effects in the pain-NRS score and TUG time at week 12.
   Conclusions. The OLP + TAU group showed no superior findings in
   comparison with the TAU group after 3 weeks and 12 weeks for Japanese
   patients with CLBP. Nonetheless, significant improvements in functional
   disability were observed in both groups.}},

Title = {{Carbon Dioxide Emissions During the 2018 Kilauea Volcano Eruption
   Estimated Using OCO-2 Satellite Retrievals}},
Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{This study applies Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) column-averaged
   dry-air mole fractions of CO2 (XCO2) to constrain CO2 fluxes during the
   2018 Kilauea volcano eruption. CO2 enhancements (Delta XCO2) of 1-2
   parts per million were observed far downwind of the eruption coincident
   with elevated sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentrations. The estimated CO2
   emission rate was 77.1 +/- 49.6 kilotons per day (kt day(-1)) on 11 July
   2018 with most of the uncertainty from modeled winds and XCO2
   retrievals. This emission rate is higher compared to flux estimates made
   with ground-based measurements (30-40 kt day(-1)). However,
   cross-sectional flux estimates made using OCO-2 XCO2 observations will
   inherently be larger than ground-based measurements near the source as
   these estimates comprise all sources of CO2 in the vicinity of the
   eruption (e.g., vegetation and soil burning). This study for the first
   time uses satellite XCO2 data similar to 200 km downwind to estimate CO2
   emissions from a major volcanic eruption.
   Plain Language Summary Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a greenhouse gas that
   plays a predominant role in climate change. Volcanoes emit CO2 and play
   a role in the global carbon cycle; however, the amount of CO2 they emit
   is highly uncertain. One of the main reasons for this uncertainty is the
   limited amount of volcanic emission measurements available to estimate
   these CO2 emissions. Satellites retrieving CO2 have an advantage over
   ground-based measurements as they have the potential to obtain data over
   the entire globe. After the launch of National Aeronautics and Space
   Administration (NASA)'s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite
   in 2014, spaceborne observations of volcanic CO2 were possible. This
   study uses OCO-2 measurements of CO2 to estimate emissions during the
   2018 Kilauea volcano eruption and is the first to trace satellite CO2
   data downwind from the source of a major volcanic eruption. Here we show
   that the Kilauea volcano eruption emitted large amounts of CO2 and OCO-2
   proved capable to observe the large atmospheric concentrations
   associated with these emissions.}},

Abstract = {{Although massive data is quickly accumulating on protein sequence and
   structure, there is a small and limited number of protein architectural
   types (or structural folds). This study is addressing the following
   question: how well could one reveal underlying sequence-structure
   relationships and design protein sequences for an arbitrary, potentially
   novel, structural fold? In response to the question, we have developed
   novel deep generative models, namely, semisupervised gcWGAN (guided,
   conditional, Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks). To overcome
   training difficulties and improve design qualities, we build our models
   on conditional Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) that uses Wasserstein distance in
   the loss function. Our major contributions include (1) constructing a
   low-dimensional and generalizable representation of the fold space for
   the conditional input, (2) developing an ultrafast sequence-to-fold
   predictor (or oracle) and incorporating its feedback into WGAN as a loss
   to guide model training, and (3) exploiting sequence data with and
   without paired structures to enable a semisupervised training strategy.
   Assessed by the oracle over 100 novel folds not in the training set,
   gcWGAN generates more successful designs and covers 3.5 times more
   target folds compared to a competing data-driven method (cVAE). Assessed
   by sequence- and structure-based predictors, gcWGAN designs are
   physically and biologically sound. Assessed by a structure predictor
   over representative novel folds, including one not even part of basis
   folds, gcWGAN designs have comparable or better fold accuracy yet much
   more sequence diversity and novelty than cVAE. The ultrafast data-driven
   model is further shown to boost the success of a principle-driven de
   novo method (RosettaDesign), through generating design seeds and
   tailoring design space. In conclusion, gcWGAN explores uncharted
   sequence space to design proteins by learning generalizable principles
   from current sequence-structure data. Data, source codes, and trained
   models are available at https://github.com/Shen-Lab/gcWGAN}},

Abstract = {{We propose a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model
   for prediction of spectral tuning in cyan, green, orange, and red
   fluorescent proteins, which are engineered by motifs of the green
   fluorescent protein. Protein variants, in which their chromophores are
   involved in the pi-stacking interaction with amino acid residues
   tyrosine, phenylalanine, and histidine, are prospective markers useful
   in bioimaging and super-resolution microscopy. In this work, we
   constructed training sets of the pi-stacked complexes of four
   fluorescent protein chromophores (of the green, orange, red, and cyan
   series) with various substituted benzenes and imidazoles and tested the
   use of dipole moment variation upon excitation (DMV) as a descriptor to
   evaluate the vertical excitation energies in these systems. To validate
   this approach, we computed and analyzed electron density distributions
   of the pi-stacked complexes and correlated the QSPR predictions with the
   reference values of the transition energies obtained using the
   high-level ab initio quantum chemistry methods. According to our
   results, the use of the DMV descriptor allows one to predict excitation
   energies in the pi-stacked complexes with errors not exceeding 0.1 eV,
   which makes this model a practically useful tool in the development of
   efficient fluorescent markers for in vivo imaging.}},

   injury, and hemorrhage, even in expert hands. Because frenotomies are
   most often performed in infants, postoperative hemorrhage is an
   important complication to look for as even small amount of bleed may
   prove fatal, due to low blood volume reserve. We report a case of
   delayed hemorrhage after laser frenotomy in a 6-week old infant
   displaying shock symptoms and required fluid resuscitation.}},

Title = {{The reaction of oleic acid monolayers with gas-phase ozone at the air

Abstract = {{Organic films that form on atmospheric particulate matter change the
   optical and cloud condensation nucleation properties of the particulate
   matter and consequently have implications for modern climate and climate
   models. The organic films are subject to attack from gas-phase oxidants
   present in ambient air. Here we revisit in greater detail the oxidation
   of a monolayer of oleic acid by gas-phase ozone at the air-water
   interface as this provides a model system for the oxidation reactions
   that occur at the air-water interface of aqueous atmospheric aerosol.
   Experiments were performed on monolayers of oleic acid at the air-liquid
   interface at atmospherically relevant ozone concentrations to
   investigate if the viscosity of the sub-phase influences the rate of the
   reaction and to determine the effect of the presence of a second
   component within the monolayer, stearic acid, which is generally
   considered to be non-reactive towards ozone, on the reaction kinetics as
   determined by neutron reflectometry measurements. Atmospheric aerosol
   can be extremely viscous. The kinetics of the reaction were found to be
   independent of the viscosity of the sub-phase below the monolayer over a
   range of moderate viscosities, eta/eta water = 1.0-7.2, demonstrating no
   involvement of aqueous sub-phase oxidants in the rate determining step.
   The kinetics of oxidation of monolayers of pure oleic acid were found to
   depend on the surface coverage with different behaviour observed above
   and below a surface coverage of oleic acid of similar to 1 x 10(18)
   molecule m(-2). Atmospheric aerosol are typically complex mixtures, and
   the presence of an additional compound in the monolayer that is inert to
   direct ozone oxidation, stearic acid, did not significantly change the
   reaction kinetics. It is demonstrated that oleic acid monolayers at the
   air-water interface do not leave any detectable material at the
   air-water interface, contradicting the previous work published in this
   journal which the authors now believe to be erroneous. The combined
   results presented here indicate that the kinetics, and thus the
   atmospheric chemical lifetime for unsaturated surface active materials
   at the air-water interface to loss by reaction with gas-phase ozone, can
   be considered to be independent of other materials present at either the
   air-water interface or in the aqueous sub-phase.}},

Abstract = {{Formamide, a simple model bio-molecule (HCONH2), is irradiated with high
   intensity, ultrashort pulses from an x-ray free electron laser. Ionic
   fragments resulting from photoionization and subsequent decay processes
   are recorded, as well as the electronic signature of the different inner
   shell ionization events that can take place during the x-ray pulses. The
   formation of double-core-hole states, where a second inner shell
   electron is removed before the first core hole has been refilled is
   observed in the electron spectra, recorded at all three sites (C, N, O)
   of the molecule. The individual ionization potentials are compared with
   results of ab initio calculations at different level of theory. Based on
   our results, future opportunities for advanced studies of
   inner-shell-induced electronic and nuclear dynamics are explored.}},

Abstract = {{Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is one of the most common thyroid
   malignancy with various histologic variants. Acknowledging the correct
   histological variant of PTC helps to know about the tumor's nature and
   prognosis. The Warthin-like variant of papillary thyroid (WLPTC), a
   newly described histologic variant of PTC, is relatively uncommon. A
   16-year-old female presented with complaints of painful thyroid swelling
   for two years. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) from the lobes
   showed lymphocytic thyroiditis features with Hurthle cell change.
   Sections from the left lobe revealed a diagnosis of a Warthin-like
   variant of PTC without nodal metastasis. WLPTC is a rare variant having
   a favorable outcome due to the absence of lymph node metastasis,
   extra-thyroidal extension, and a low recurrence rate. The correct
   cytological and histomorphological features are of utmost importance to
   render the diagnosis of WLPTC for better rnanagement.}},

Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC 28}},
Abstract = {{We present state-selective measurements on the NH2+ + H+ and NH+ + H+ +
   H dissociation channels following single-photon double ionization at
   61.5 eV of neutral NH3, where the two photoelectrons and two cations are
   measured in coincidence using 3D momentum imaging. Three dication
   electronic states are identified to contribute to the NH2+ + H+
   dissociation channel, where the excitation in one of the three states
   undergoes intersystem crossing prior to dissociation, producing a cold
   NH2+ fragment. In contrast, the other two states directly dissociate,
   producing a ro-vibrationally excited NH2+ fragment with roughly 1 eV of
   internal energy. The NH+ + H+ + H channel is fed by direct dissociation
   from three intermediate dication states, one of which is shared with the
   NH2+ + H+ channel. We find evidence of autoionization contributing to
   each of the double ionization channels. The distributions of the
   relative emission angle between the two photoelectrons, as well as the
   relative angle between the recoil axis of the molecular breakup and the
   polarization vector of the ionizing field, are also presented to provide
   insight on both the photoionization and photodissociation mechanisms for
   the different dication states.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the link between child maltreatment and delinquency has been
   well-established, relatively few studies have examined gender
   differences in the protective role of school factors that attenuates
   delinquency for adolescents who reported child maltreatment. This study
   aimed to examine gender-specific trajectories of child maltreatment,
   school engagement, and delinquency with a framework of life course
   perspectives. It also examined the protective role of school engagement
   trajectory on delinquency over time by gender. A total of 348
   adolescents who reported maltreatment experiences in a nationally
   representative sample from the Korea Welfare Panel study with three
   waves was examined using latent growth models. The results revealed that
   males experienced neglect, physical and emotional abuse significantly
   more than females at baseline, but this significance disappeared as
   females' experience increased with age. Being male decreased initial
   level of school engagement at baseline, which also increased initial
   level of delinquency, but being male increased the growth rate of school
   engagement over time, which also decreased the growth rate of
   delinquency. Females who experienced maltreatment rapidly dropped school
   engagement without increasing delinquency. Sexual abuse, neglect, and
   multiple types of maltreatment experiences also fit the model.
   Implication of the findings for females and males were different and
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The design and development of efficient emitters for deep-blue OLEDs
   with CIEy < 0.10 remains a challenge. A new series of tetracoordinated
   difluoroboron (BF2)-enabled thermally activated delayed fluorescent
   (TADF) materials with D-A-BF2-type and D-pi-A-BF2-type frameworks for
   sky-blue to deep-blue emitters were designed and developed. The emission
   colors could be effectively tuned through regulating the degree of
   conjugation between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and
   lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) by simply introducing a
   methyl group into the phenyl ring to adjust the molecular geometries and
   change the acceptor moieties, which were strongly supported by the
   density functional theory (DFT) calculations and electrochemical
   studies. All the tetracoordinated difluoroboron TADF emitters are
   air-stable and insensitive to moisture, and they are strongly emissive
   in degassed toluene peaking at 435-471 nm with high photoluminescence
   quantum efficiencies (PLQYs) of 94-99\%. The BF2-MPCz-doped sky-blue
   OLED demonstrated a peak EQE of 13.8\% with a L-max value of 20853 cd
   m(-2) and CIE coordinates of (0.175, 0.354), and the BF2-DMCz-doped
   deep-blue OLED achieved a peak EQE of 8.4\% with CIE coordinates of
   (0.149, 0.083). This indicates that the BF2-enabled TADF materials can
   act as efficient emitters for the fabrication of sky-blue to deep-blue
   OLEDs.}},

Abstract = {{Organic azides are an efficient source of nitrenes, which serve as
   vigorous intermediates in many useful organic reactions. In this work,
   the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) and its
   second-order perturbation (CASPT2) methods were employed to study the
   photochemistry of 2-furoylazide 1 and 3-furoylazide 5, including the
   Curtius rearrangement to two furylisocyanates (3 and 7) and subsequent
   reactions to the final product cyanoacrolein 9. Our calculations show
   that the photoinduced Curtius rearrangement of the two furoylazides
   takes place through similar stepwise mechanisms via two bistable
   furoylnitrenes 2 and 6. However, the decarbonylation and ring-opening
   process of 7 to 9 prefers a stepwise mechanism involving the
   3-furoylnitrene intermediate 8, while 3 to 9 goes in a concerted
   asynchronous way without the corresponding 2-furoylnitrene intermediate
   4. Importantly, we revealed that several conical intersections play key
   roles in the photochemistry of furoylazides. Our results are not only
   consistent and also make clear the experimental observations (X. Zeng,
   et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2018, 140, 10-13), but additionally provide
   important information on the chemistry of furoylazides and nitrenes.}},

   water content, the decreasing of electromagnetic wave energy with
   increasing depth can be described by maximum peak amplitude, while, the
   decreasing of electromagnetic wave energy with increasing water content
   at certain depth can be described by average amplitude. In addition,
   energy of electromagnetic wave is negatively correlated to the
   dielectric constant because of the positive correlation between water
   content and dielectric constant. This study can provide significant

Title = {{Evaluation of the Performance Degradation of Hybrid Steel-Polypropylene
   Fiber Reinforced Concrete under Freezing-Thawing Conditions}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{DEC 28}},
Abstract = {{The reasonable inclusion of hybrid fibers can leverage the advantages of
   each kind of fiber and enhance the frost resistance and flexural
   toughness of concrete. Previous studies on hybrid steel-polypropylene
   fiber reinforced concrete (HSPFRC) focused primarily on its mechanics
   instead of its frost resistance. In this work, the compressive strength,
   splitting tensile strength, mass loss rate, relative dynamic elastic
   modulus (RDEM), and flexural toughness of HSPFRC after freezing-thawing
   (F-T) are studied, and the relative importance of each factor affecting
   the frost resistance of HSPFRC is quantified by using fuzzy rough set
   theory. The results show that the inclusion of hybrid fibers has a
   noticeable effect on the frost resistance of HSPFRC after hundreds of
   F-T cycles and that the effect on the splitting tensile strength is
   greater than that on the compressive strength. After 500 F-T cycles, as
   the steel fiber (SF) content increases, the compressive strength and
   splitting tensile strength increase by factors of approximately 5 and 4,
   respectively, the flexural toughness is strengthened, and the mass loss
   rate is reduced by more than 90\%. The addition of polypropylene fibers
   (PFs) has a relatively small effect on the strength of HSPFRC but
   reduces the mass loss of HSPFRC by almost 80\%. However, the suitability
   of the RDEM for evaluating the frost resistance of HSPFRC remains
   uncertain. Quantified by fuzzy rough set theory, the weights of the
   factors affecting the frost resistance of HSPFRC are 0.50 (number of F-T
   cycles) > 0.35 (SF content) > 0.15 (PF content), verifying the
   experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known regarding how multimorbidity combinations associated
   with obesity change with increase in body weight. This study employed
   data from the national Cerner HealthFacts Data Warehouse to identify
   changes in multimorbidity patterns by weight class using network
   analysis. Networks were generated for 154 528 middle-aged patients in
   the following categories: normal weight, overweight, and classes 1, 2,
   and 3 obesity. The results show significant differences (P-value<0.05)
   in prevalence by weight class for all but three of 82 diseases
   considered. The percentage of patients with multimorbidity (excluding
   obesity) increases from in 55.1\% in patients with normal weight, to
   57.88\% with overweight, 70.39\% with Class 1 obesity, 73.99\% with
   Class 2 obesity, and 71.68\% in Class 3 obesity, increasing most
   substantially with the progression from overweight to class 1 obesity.
   Most prevalent disease clusters expand from only hypertension and
   dorsalgia in normal weight, to add joint disorders in overweight,
   lipidemias in class 1 obesity, diabetes in class 2 obesity, and sleep
   disorders and chronic kidney disease in class 3 obesity. Recognition of
   multimorbidity patterns associated with weight increase is essential for
   true precision care of obesity-associated chronic conditions and can
   help clinicians identify and address preclinical disease before

Abstract = {{The paper discusses the need to develop effective tools for social and
   labour monitoring of personnel with regard to the transition to remote
   employment. It shows that the percentage of employees working remotely
   has increased over time. The events of 2020 only strengthened this trend
   and accelerated many processes associated with the digitalization of
   management and production processes.
   The purpose of the study is to analyze and assess the features of social
   and labour monitoring in the context of the transition to remote
   employment.
   Many companies use special software tools to judge the effectiveness of
   the use of working time. The authors have analyzed the software products
   most often used by companies in the transition to remote employment and
   identified the principles that companies should adhere to in order to
   effectively transform their activities in the current environment. The
   implementation of such systems is always associated with the ethical
   side of control. Therefore, finding a balance between control and trust
   is an important condition for effective work.
   A comparative analysis of the level of technical equipment by country
   has been carried out. The authors have drawn conclusions about the
   possibilities of switching to a hybrid mode of operation for certain
   areas of activity in the future.
   The greatest potential for remote employment remains among
   well-qualified workers. The article shows that the possibilities of
   switching to remote employment directly depend on the structure of the
   economy (the share of the financial sector and agriculture), as well as
   on the possibility of automating the type of activity that brings the
   greatest income to the state.}},

Abstract = {{We utilize first-principles theory to investigate photo-induced
   excited-state dynamics of functionalized perylene diimide. This class of
   materials is highly suitable for solar energy conversion because of the
   strong optical absorbance, efficient energy transfer, and chemical
   tunability. We couple time-dependent density functional theory to a
   recently developed time-resolved non-adiabatic dynamics approach based
   on a semi-empirical description. By studying the monomer and dimer, we
   focus on the role stacking plays on the time-scales associated with
   excited-state non-radiative relaxation from a high excitonic state to
   the lowest energy exciton. We predict that the time-scale for energy
   conversion in the dimer is significantly faster than that in the monomer
   when equivalent excited states are accounted for. Additionally, for the
   dimer, the decay from the second to the nearly degenerate lowest energy
   excited-state involves two time-scales: a rapid decay on the order of
   similar to 10 fs followed by a slower decay of similar to 100 fs.
   Analysis of the spatial localization of the electronic transition
   density during the internal conversion process points out the existence
   of localized states on individual monomers, indicating that the strength
   of thermal fluctuations exceeds electronic couplings between the states
   such that the exciton hops between localized states throughout the
   simulation.}},

   Activity: Wave Amplitude, Frequency, and Power Spectra}},

Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{We present the first clear observational connection between
   interplanetary shock impact angles and magnetospheric ultralow frequency
   (ULF) wave activity. We perform a comparative study of two solar wind
   shocks with relatively similar strengths, but one being nearly frontal
   and, the other, highly inclined. We utilize multipoint observations with
   magnetometers based in space and on the ground for comparisons. For
   satellites and ground stations occupying similar local time positions,
   we find that the ULF waves have larger amplitudes and tend to be more
   narrowband in the case of the nearly head-on impact, confirming previous
   simulation results. Additionally, we provide evidence that, due to their
   symmetric compression nature, nearly frontal shocks can excite only odd
   mode waves, while asymmetric compressions caused by inclined shocks can
   excite both odd and even mode waves. These results suggest that shock
   impact angles play crucial roles in mediating ULF wave-particle
   interactions in the inner magnetosphere.
   Plain Language Summary The interaction of solar perturbations with the
   Earth's magnetic field is of paramount importance in space weather
   investigations. The subsequent response is almost always characterized
   by magnetic field disturbances measured in space and on the ground,
   which in turn can modulate energetic particle populations that damage
   satellite electronics and cause electric current surges in large-scale
   power transmission lines. These disturbances are also manifested as
   geomagnetic pulsations which in part are responsible for the
   distribution of energy in the near-Earth space environment. In this
   work, we connect, for the first time, observational properties of these
   pulsations or waves with the impact angle of the perturbation. We find
   that nearly head-on impacts are associated with stronger wave response
   in comparison to inclined impacts. These results show that space weather
   forecasters should take the perturbation impact angle into account when
   predicting geomagnetic effects caused by solar perturbations.}},

Abstract = {{Attractive materials fundamentally depend on both performance and
   industrialization potential. To address the scale-up concern, a simple
   and highly effective synthesis of porous organic polymers from
   commercial building blocks/monomers is urgently needed. Here we report
   the fabrication of amino-functionalized hypercrosslinked polymer
   nanoparticles (AHCPNPs) for CO2 capture by utilizing commercial
   polystyrene (PS) as the main building blocks and poly(tert-butyl
   acrylate)-b-poly(styrene) (PtBA-b-PS) diblock copolymers as a
   stabilizer. The 2-step synthetic strategy includes hypercrosslinking of
   benzene units in PS and PtBA-b-PS chains and subsequent aminolysis
   reaction of the acrylate-unit in PtBA-b-PS chains by diamine compounds.
   The AHCPNPs demonstrate a well-defined microporous structure with a
   specific surface area of up to 507.64 m(2) g(-1) and an extreme capacity
   of 53.65 w\% (12.21 mmol g(-1)) for carbon dioxide adsorption. The
   definite control over the particle size and porous properties of these
   AHCPNPs has been achieved by changing the BA/S ratio of the diblock
   copolymers and the mass ratio of PtBA-b-PS to PS. Our findings may open
   up a new avenue for scale-up fabrication that possesses a well-porous
   structure from commercial polymeric materials and thus generate valuable
   breakthroughs in many applications, especially in industrialization.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple-band nature of electronic energy bands leads to novel physical

   the multiple-band Fermi system shows a non-Fermi liquid (non-FL)
   behavior in its thermodynamic and magnetic properties. At a quantum
   critical point (QCP), Fermi velocities of the two FSs are renormalized
   into the same critical velocity as a boson velocity, and the fermion's
   density of states (DOS) shows a pseudogap behavior with a logarithmic

Title = {{Will supply side policies work with Millennials?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{100-113}},
Month = {{JAN 20}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   This paper aims to hypothesize on the relationship between the
   Millennial workforce and US firms' response to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
   (TCJA) of 2017. The authors postulate that societal pressure from the
   younger generational cohorts will motivate socially cognizant
   corporations to share their newly acquired tax benefits with their
   workforce to attract, retain and inspire employee productivity and
   retention, as well as customer loyalty.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The authors empirically examine work-related cultural attitudes of the
   Millennial generational cohort in the USA, and by exploring related
   literature on organizational management and supply side economics, the
   authors aim to connect them to firms' response to tax cut windfall in a
   simple theoretical model. The authors complement their methods by using
   descriptive statistics on firm tax responses that followed the 2017
   TCJA.
   Findings
   The authors offer support for the notion that companies are behaving
   rationally by providing short-term benefits to employees when employees
   are, on average, younger. The competitive nature of the global market
   acts as an incentive to avoid permanent obligations such as wage and
   benefits increases. The data reveal that a significant number of
   companies had a transitory reaction to the latest tax cut.
   Research limitations/implications
   The authors encourage future research, once sufficient time elapses, to
   exploit the time periods before and after the tax cut to provide a
   better assessment of the empirical impact of the 2017 tax cut on firm
   responses, conditional on workforce makeup.
   Originality/value
   The authors examine whether and how the Millennial cohort might shape
   firm behavior following changes in tax policy.}},

Title = {{Does age affect oesophagectomy survival: a cohort study}},
Journal = {{ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY}},
Abstract = {{Background Curative oesophagectomy for oesophageal cancer is associated
   with considerable potential mortality. Surgeons are increasingly
   treating older patients presenting with oesophageal cancer as the
   population ages. The question remains as to the survival in an older
   population group, many of whom are not fit for combined multimodal
   therapy. This study aimed to assess the effect of age on overall
   survival and disease-free survival in patients undergoing curative
   oesophagectomy for cancer.
   Methods Patient data were analysed from a prospectively maintained
   database. Demographic, surgical and survival outcomes were compared
   between groups according to age less than 75 years or 75 and older.
   Results Oesophagectomy was performed in 351 patients between 1990 and
   2019 (283 patients <75 years, 68 patients >= 75 years). There was a
   higher rate of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the older group (37.7\%
   versus 7.4\%; P < 0.001). The 30-day mortality between younger and older
   groups was similar (2.5\% and 2.9\%; P = 0.827). There was no
   statistical difference in 5-year survival rates (50.3\% versus 38.6\%; P
   = 0.082) or median survival (22.6 versus 19.3 months; P = 0.053) between
   groups. There was no statistical difference in 5-year disease-free
   survival (45.1\% and 35.7\%; P = 0.180).
   Conclusion Overall survival, disease-free survival and 30-day mortality
   rates in patients aged 75 years and older were not statistically
   different to their younger counterparts. On the basis of these results,
   older patients should not be precluded from consideration of potentially
   curative oesophagectomy on age alone, providing surgery may be performed
   at reasonable risk.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Microbial communities associated with freshwater aquatic habitats and
   resident species are both critical to and indicative of ecosystem status
   and organismal health. External surfaces of turtle shells readily
   accumulate microbial growth and could carry representation of
   habitat-wide microbial diversity, since they are in regular contact with
   multiple elements of freshwater environments. Yet, microbial diversity
   residing on freshwater turtle shells is poorly understood. We applied
   16S and 18S metabarcoding to characterize microbiota associated with
   external shell surfaces of 20 red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta)
   turtles collected from varied habitats in central and western Oklahoma,
   and ranging to southeast Iowa. Shell-associated microbial communities
   were highly diverse, with samples dominated by Bacteroidia and
   alpha-/gamma-proteobacteria, and ciliophoran alveolates. Alpha diversity
   was lower on turtle shells compared to shallow-water-associated
   environmental samples, likely resulting from basking-drying behavior and
   seasonal scute shedding, while alpha diversity was higher on carapace
   than plastron surfaces. Beta diversity of turtle shells was similarly
   differentiated from environmental samples, although sampling site was
   consistently a significant factor. Deinococcus-Thermus bacteria and
   ciliophoran alveolates were recovered with significantly higher
   abundance on turtle shells versus environmental samples, while bacterial
   taxa known to include human-pathogenic species were variably more
   abundant between shell and environmental samples. Microbial communities
   from a single, shared-site collection of the ecologically similar river
   cooter (P. concinna) largely overlapped with those of T. scripta. These
   data add to a foundation for further characterization of turtle shell
   microbial communities across species and habitats, with implications for
   freshwater habitat assessment, microbial ecology and wildlife
   conservation efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Reduced graphene oxide/aramid nanofiber ( rGO/ANF) supercapacitor
   electrodes have a good combination of energy storage and mechanical
   properties, but ion transport remains an issue toward achieving higher
   energy densities at high current because of the tightly packed electrode
   structure. Herein, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are introduced to prevent rGO
   flake stacking to improve the rate capability of the rGO/ANF structural
   supercapacitor. The effect of CNTs on the rGO/ANF composite electrode's
   mechanical and electrochemical properties is investigated by varying the
   composition. The addition of 20 wt \% CNTs led to an increase in Young's
   modulus up to 10.3 +/- 1.8 GPa, while a maximum in ultimate strain and
   strength of 1.3 +/- 0.14\% and 55 +/- 6.8 MPa, respectively, was found
   at a loading of 2.5 wt \% CNTs. At low specific currents, the electrodes
   performed similarly (160-170 F g(-1)), but at high specific currents (5
   A g(-1)), the addition of 20 wt \% CNTs led to a significantly higher
   capacitance (76 F g(-1)) as compared to that of rGO/ANF electrodes
   without CNTs (26 F g(-1)). In addition, the energy density also improved
   significantly at high power from 1.4 to 5.1 W h L-1 with the addition of
   CNTs. The improvement in mechanical properties is attributed to the
   introduction of additional hydrogenbonding and pi-pi interactions from
   the carboxylic acid-functionalized CNTs. The increase in capacitance at
   higher discharge rates is due to improved ion transport from the CNTs.
   Finally, in situ electrochemomechanical testing examines how capacitance
   varies with strain in these structural electrodes for the first time.}},

Abstract = {{Structure-based fragment growing is one of the key techniques in
   fragment-based drug design. Fragment growing is commonly practiced based
   on structural and biophysical data. Computational workflows are employed
   to predict which fragment elaborations could lead to high-affinity
   binders. Several such workflows exist but many are designed to be long
   running noninteractive systems. Shape-based descriptors have been proven
   to be fast and perform well at virtual-screening tasks. They could,
   therefore, be applied to the fragment-growing problem to enable an
   interactive fragment-growing workflow. In this work, we describe and
   analyze the use of specific shape-based directional descriptors for the
   task of fragment growing. The performance of these descriptors that we
   call ray volume matrices (RVMs) is evaluated on two data sets containing
   protein-ligand complexes. While the first set focuses on self-growing,
   the second measures practical performance in a cross-growing scenario.
   The runtime of screenings using RVMs as well as their robustness to
   three dimensional perturbations is also investigated. Overall, it can be
   shown that RVMs are useful to prefilter fragment candidates. For up to
   84\% of the 3299 generated self-growing cases and for up to 66\% of the
   326 generated cross-growing cases, RVMs could create poses with less
   than 2 A root-mean-square deviation to the crystal structure with
   average query speeds of around 30,000 conformations per second. This
   opens the door for fast explorative screenings of fragment libraries.}},

Abstract = {{Importance Despite high prevalence of elevated blood pressure (BP) among
   medical inpatients, BP management guidelines are lacking for this
   population. The outcomes associated with intensifying BP treatment in
   the hospital are poorly studied. Objectives To characterize clinician
   response to BP in the hospital and at discharge and to compare short-
   and long-term outcomes associated with antihypertensive treatment
   intensification. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study
   took place from January 1 to December 31, 2017, with 1 year of follow-up
   at 10 hospitals within the Cleveland Clinic Hospitals health care
   system. All adults admitted to a medicine service in 2017 were evaluated
   for inclusion. Patients with cardiovascular diagnoses were excluded.
   Demographic and BP characteristics were used for propensity matching.
   Exposures Acute hypertension treatment, defined as administration of an
   intravenous antihypertensive medication or a new class of an oral
   antihypertensive treatment. Main Outcomes and Measures The association
   between acute hypertension treatment and subsequent inpatient acute
   kidney injury, myocardial injury, and stroke was measured. Postdischarge
   outcomes included stroke and myocardial infarction within 30 days and BP
   control up to 1 year. Results Among 22 834 adults hospitalized for
   noncardiovascular diagnoses (mean {[}SD] age, 65.6 {[}17.9] years; 12
   993 women {[}56.9\%]; 15 963 White patients {[}69.9\%]), 17 821 (78\%)
   had at least 1 hypertensive BP recorded during their admission. Of these
   patients, 5904 (33.1\%) were treated. A total of 8692 of 106 097 cases
   (8.2\%) of hypertensive systolic BPs were treated; of these, 5747 (66\%)
   were treated with oral medications. In a propensity-matched sample
   controlling for patient and BP characteristics, treated patients had
   higher rates of subsequent acute kidney injury (466 of 4520 {[}10.3\%]
   vs 357 of 4520 {[}7.9\%]; P < .001) and myocardial injury (53 of 4520
   {[}1.2\%] vs 26 of 4520 {[}0.6\%]; P = .003). There was no BP interval
   in which treated patients had better outcomes than untreated patients. A
   total of 1645 of 17 821 patients (9\%) with hypertension were discharged
   with an intensified antihypertensive regimen. Medication intensification
   at discharge was not associated with better BP control in the following
   year. Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study, hypertension was
   common among medical inpatients, but antihypertensive treatment
   intensification was not. Intensification of therapy without signs of
   end-organ damage was associated with worse outcomes.
   Question Among adults with noncardiac admissions, is treatment of
   hypertension during the admission or antihypertensive treatment
   intensification at discharge associated with better outcomes? Findings
   In this cohort study of 22 834 adults, inpatient hypertension treatment,
   both oral and intravenous, was associated with higher rates of
   subsequent acute kidney and myocardial injury. There was no blood
   pressure interval in which treatment was associated with better
   outcomes, and medication intensification at discharge was not associated
   with improved blood pressure control. Meaning In this study, in the
   absence of evidence of end-organ damage, conservative management of
   inpatient hypertension was associated with improved outcomes compared
   with more intensive management.
   This cohort study uses data from the electronic health record of
   patients admitted to Cleveland Clinic Hospitals to assess the outcomes
   of adults with noncardiac inpatient admissions who were treated for
   hypertension.}},

Title = {{Epidemiology, clinical characteristics, household transmission, and
   lethality of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection
   among healthcare workers in Ontario, Canada}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Introduction
   Protecting healthcare workers (HCWs) from Severe Acute Respiratory
   Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a priority to maintain a safe and
   functioning healthcare system. Our objective was to describe and compare
   the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and lethality of SARS-CoV-2
   infections among HCWs compared to non-HCWs.
   Methods
   Using reportable disease data at Public Health Ontario, we conducted a
   population-based cross-sectional study comparing demographic, exposure,
   and clinical variables between HCWs and non-HCWs with SARS-CoV-2
   infections as of 30 September 2020. We calculated rates of infections
   over time and determined the frequency of within household transmissions
   using natural language processing based on residential address. We
   evaluated the risk of death using a multivariable logistic regression
   model adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, symptoms, and long-term
   care home exposure.
   Results
   There were 7,050 (12.5\%) HCW SARS-CoV-2 infections in Ontario, Canada,
   of whom 24.9\% were nurses, 2.3\% were physicians, and the remaining
   72.8\% other specialties, including personal support workers. Overall
   HCWs had an infection rate of 1,276 per 100,000 compared to non-HCWs of
   346 per 100,000 (3.7 times higher). This difference decreased from a 7
   times higher rate in April to no difference in September 2020.
   Twenty-six percent of HCWs had a household member with SARS-CoV-2
   infection; 6.8\% were probable acquisitions, 12.3\% secondary
   transmissions, and 6.9\% unknown direction of transmission. Death among
   HCWs was 0.2\% compared to 6.1\% of non-HCWs. The risk of death in HCWs
   remained significantly lower than non-HCWs after adjustment (adjusted
   odds ratio 0.09; 95\%CI 0.05-0.17).
   Conclusion
   HCWs represent a disproportionate number of diagnosed SARS-CoV-2
   infections in Ontario, however this discrepancy is at least partially
   explained by limitations in testing earlier in the pandemic for
   non-HCWs. We observed a low risk of death in HCWs which could not be
   completely explained by other factors.}},

   incorporates surface tension and reduced noise. For little to no noise,
   both models reproduce the well-known Saffman-Taylor finger. We compare
   both models in the region of intermediate noise, where we observe

   show that as the noise in the system is increased, the mean behavior in

   far behind the leading front. We also investigate how the noise scales

Abstract = {{Background: The assessment of cross-curricular skills is gaining
   attention in many countries. In Japan, the `Information Literacy Survey
   for Upper Secondary Students' (the ILSUS) was designed to measure
   information literacy through Computer-Based Testing (CBT). It was the
   first large-scale survey based on Item Response Theory (IRT) implemented
   by Japan's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and
   Technology (MEXT).
   Purpose: This paper reports on the history and development of the survey
   and discusses its findings. As `information literacy' is a generic and
   cross-curricular ability, we measured cognitive ability relating to how
   information can be utilised for problem-solving.
   Main argument: We present some released survey items that were actually
   used in the ILSUS, to explain how the items covered three aspects of
   `information literacy'. Using proficiency levels, we discuss what the
   findings indicated about the features of the students' `information
   literacy': it was evident that, whilst many had the ability to deal with
   complex and large amounts of information, few were able to address
   unfamiliar contexts. Then, using questionnaire items from the ILSUS, we
   report how we determined that `information literacy' was strongly
   associated with `student-teacher relationships' and `meta-cognition'.
   Conclusion: This account of the ILSUS offers insight into how we
   measured information literacy and, more widely, the kinds of skills that
   Japanese education policy is trying to develop. In planning a new
   Information Literacy Survey (ILS), we will try to capture what has not
   been clarified yet, such as the trends in information literacy and
   differences between educational stages. It may ultimately become
   possible to specify, more clearly, the goals and teaching methods that
   should be aimed at in the acquisition and teaching of information
   literacy.}},

Abstract = {{Thrombocytopenia is a common clinical condition associated with a wide
   variety of clinical conditions including infections, malignancy,
   medications, liver disorder, and autoimmune conditions, etc. The
   association between thrombocytopenia and herpes simplex virus (HSV) is
   reported only once in a case report dating back to 1978. We report a
   case of a 66-year-old female with generalized weakness, mechanical fall,
   genital ulcerations, and breast fold and genital area skin redness,
   warmth, and mild tenderness. Initial labs showed mild leukocytosis,
   normal platelet count, mild lactic acidosis, and urine analysis
   suggestive of urinary tract infection. The patient was started on
   broad-spectrum antibiotics. During the course of hospitalization, the
   patient developed severe thrombocytopenia with platelet counts dropping
   less than 40000/mu L (normal range: 150,000-450,000/mu L), and genital
   pain and ulceration worsened. The genital swab was sent which came back
   positive for the HSV-2 virus. Soon after the start of acyclovir for
   HSV-2 infection, the genital pain and ulceration improved and platelet
   counts gradually increased to 157,000/4. Other causes of
   thrombocytopenia such as sepsis, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia,
   consumptive coagulopathy, medication-induced thrombocytopenia, immune
   thrombocytopenia, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura were ruled
   out.}},

Title = {{On the Derivation of Nonclassical Symmetries of the Black-Scholes
   Equation via an Equivalence Transformation}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{DEC 28}},
Abstract = {{The nonclassical symmetries method is a powerful extension of the
   classical symmetries method for finding exact solutions of differential
   equations. Through this method, one is able to arrive at new exact
   solutions of a given differential equation, i.e., solutions that are not
   obtainable directly as invariant solutions from classical symmetries of
   the equation. The challenge with the nonclassical symmetries method,
   however, is that governing equations for the admitted nonclassical
   symmetries are typically coupled and nonlinear and therefore difficult
   to solve. In instances where a given equation is related to a simpler
   one via an equivalent transformation, we propose that nonclassical
   symmetries of the given equation may be obtained by transforming
   nonclassical symmetries of the simpler equation using the equivalence
   transformation. This is what we illustrate in this paper. We construct
   four nontrivial nonclassical symmetries of the Black-Scholes equation by
   transforming nonclassical symmetries of the heat equation. For
   completeness, we also construct invariant solutions of the Black-Scholes
   equation associated with the determined nonclassical symmetries.}},

Title = {{Flat corannulene: when a transition state becomes a stable molecule}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{48}},
Month = {{DEC 28}},
Abstract = {{Flat corannulene has been considered so far only as a transition state
   of the bowl-to-bowl inversion process. This study was driven by the
   prediction that substituents with strong steric repulsion could
   destabilize the bowl-shaped conformation of this molecule to such an
   extent that the highly unstable planar geometry would become an isolable
   molecule. To examine the substituents' effect on the corannulene bowl
   depth, optimized structures for the highly-congested
   decakis(t-butylsulfido)corannulene were calculated. The computations,
   performed with both the M06-2X/def2-TZVP and the B3LYP/def2-TZVP methods
   (the latter with and without Grimme's D3 dispersion correction), predict
   that this molecule can achieve two minimum structures: a flat carbon
   framework and a bowl-shaped structure, which are very close in energy.
   This rather unusual compound was easily synthesized from
   decachlorocorannulene under mild reaction conditions, and X-ray
   crystallographic studies gave similar results to the theoretical
   predictions. This compound crystallized in two different polymorphs, one
   exhibiting a completely flat corannulene core and the other having a
   bowl-shaped conformation.}},

Abstract = {{A kind of micro serpentine spring by wire electrical discharge machining
   (WEDM) is selected as research object, and the bending deformation
   mechanism of serpentine spring during cutting was discussed. Then a
   method of reducing the bending deformation of the micro serpentine
   spring was studied. The results demonstrate that the resultant force of
   the serpentine spring is attractive force. The degree of deformation is
   closely related to the material and the deformation of pure copper is
   smallest, so it is also a good choice to choose alternative materials.
   The deformation angle of the serpentine spring was reduced from 16.2
   degrees to 3.6 degrees by establishing the supporting structure,
   changing the cutting trajectory, using multi-cutting and stress relief
   annealing methods. The bending deformation of the serpentine spring was
   significantly improved, which provided a new method for the processing
   of mechanical micro structures or devices.}},

   increase of emergency calls, and secondary services were requested from
   nearby municipalities to help with the increased workload. The emergency
   operations center in Mesa County, Colorado (Grand Junction) was
   activated as a result of the numerous accidents and injuries across the
   region. An ice storm of this magnitude has not been experienced in Grand

Title = {{Participation in community-based health care interventions (CBHIs) and
   its association with hypertension awareness, control and treatment in
   Indonesia}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 28}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Little attention has been paid to whether CBHIs improve awareness,
   treatment and control of hypertension in the contexts of low- and
   middle- income countries (LMICs). This study therefore aims to examine
   participation in CBHIs for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and its
   association with awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension among
   Indonesians.
   Methods
   This study used data from the 2014 Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS),
   drawn from 30,351 respondents aged 18 years and older. Participation in
   CBHIs was measured by respondents' participation in CBHIs for NCDs
   (Posbindu PTM and Posbindu Lansia) during the 12 months prior to the
   survey. Logistic regressions were used to identify the relationships
   between participation in CBHIs for NCDs and awareness, treatment, and
   control of blood pressure among respondents with hypertension.
   Results
   The age-adjusted prevalence of hypertension was 31.2\% and 29.2\% in
   urban and rural areas, respectively. The overall age-adjusted prevalence
   was 30.2\%. Approximately 41.8\% of respondents with hypertension were
   aware of their condition, and only 6.6\% of respondents were receiving
   treatment. Participation in CBHIs for NCDs was associated with 50\%
   higher odds of being aware and 118\% higher odds of receiving treatment
   among adults with hypertension. There was no significant association
   between participation in CBHIs for NCDs and controlled hypertension.
   Conclusion
   Our data emphasise the importance of CBHIs for NCDs to improve the
   awareness and treatment of hypertension in the Indonesian population.}},

Abstract = {{The 90-degree bend is one of the basic connection components applied in
   industrial flowing systems. This bend influences the aerodynamic
   performance of the downstream connecting equipment. In this study, the
   performance of a two-stage axial compressor with a 90-degree bend inlet
   was numerically and experimentally analyzed under low rotating speed.
   The testing results show that the outflow of the bend was numerically
   non-uniform in the circumferential and radial directions. To analyze the
   performance influence of the bend on the downstream compressor, a full
   passage compressor model with and without the inlet bend was simulated.
   The size of the distortion region gradually spread to the entire
   cascade, and the intensity of the distortion obviously dropped after the
   first stage as the compressor ran with the bend. The deterioration of
   the compressor performance, especially in the first stage, was verified
   numerically and experimentally. The total pressure coefficient and
   isentropic efficiency decreased by 2.6 \% and 1.13 \%, respectively. To
   save simulation cost, a model with a downstream single blade passage and
   cylindrical inlet was proposed, and the distorted flow was set as the
   inlet boundary condition. In addition, the unsteady numerical simulation
   was performed with the rotating inlet distortion region. Compared with
   the full blade passage model, the unsteady single blade passage model
   obtained the downstream spread characteristic of the distortion and
   performance deterioration. The latter can therefore be suggested as a
   compromised approach for obtaining the propagation characteristics of
   the inlet distortion with acceptable accuracy and low computational
   cost.}},

Abstract = {{We calculate cross sections for production of axial-vector f(1)(1285)
   mesons for double-tagged measurements of the e(+)e(-) -> e(+)e(-)
   f(1)(1285) reaction. Different gamma{*}gamma{*} -> f(1)(1285) vertices
   from the literature are used. Both integrated cross section as well as
   differential distributions are calculated. Predictions for a potential
   measurement at Belle II are presented. Quite different results are
   obtained for the different vertices proposed in the literature. Several
   observables are discussed. The distribution in photon virtuality
   asymmetry is especially sensitive to the gamma{*}gamma{*} -> f(1)
   vertex. Future measurements at e(+)e(-) colliders could test and/or
   constrain the gamma{*}gamma{*} -> f(1)(a(1), f'(1)) vertices and
   associated form factors, known to be important ingredients for
   calculating contributions to anomalous magnetic moment of muon and
   hyperfine splitting of levels of muonic atoms. In addition we present
   helicity amplitudes as a function of both photon virtualities. Only some
   amplitudes are different from zero. Different models have different
   relative size of LT, TL, and TT amplitudes.}},

Abstract = {{Background Patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)
   have worse long-term prognoses than those with ST-elevation myocardial
   infarction (STEMI).
   Hypothesis It may be attributable to more extended coronary
   atherosclerotic disease burden in patients with NSTEMI.
   Methods This study consisted of consecutive 231 patients who underwent
   coronary intervention for myocardial infarction (MI). To assess the
   extent and severity of atherosclerotic disease burden of non-culprit
   coronary arteries, two scoring systems (Gensini score and synergy
   between percutaneous coronary intervention with Taxus and cardiac
   surgery {[}SYNTAX] score) were modified by subtracting the score of the
   culprit lesion: the non-culprit Gensini score and the non-culprit SYNTAX
   score.
   Results Patients with NSTEMI had more multi-vessel disease, initial
   thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade 2/3, and final
   TIMI flow grade 3 than those with STEMI. As compared to STEMI, patients
   with NSTEMI had significantly higher non-culprit Gensini score (16.3 +/-
   19.8 vs. 31.2 +/- 25.4, p < 0.001) and non-culprit SYNTAX score (5.8 +/-
   7.0 vs. 11.1 +/- 9.7, p < 0.001).
   Conclusions Patients with NSTEMI had more advanced coronary
   atherosclerotic disease burden including non-obstruction lesions, which
   may at least in part explain higher incidence of cardiovascular events
   in these patients.}},

   Industry(sic)(sic)(sic)Palabras clave}},
Journal = {{POLICY STUDIES JOURNAL}},
Abstract = {{Policy termination is an understudied phenomenon. The literature
   identifies some factors that affect its likelihood, but others'
   importance, especially program evaluation, remain ambiguous. For
   insight, this study examines the impact of independent program
   evaluation on the termination of tax incentives for film and television
   production adopted and then terminated by multiple state governments.
   Empirical results indicate that termination was significantly more
   likely after an evaluation showed the incentive's costs exceeded its
   benefits. Results also indicate a contagion effect. Other factors,
   including the incentive's age and employment in the entertainment
   industry, reduced termination likelihood. These findings persisted
   through several robustness and sensitivity checks. Although critical
   program evaluation does not guarantee termination, it appears to make it
   a more likely outcome.}},

Abstract = {{While disability has historically been depicted in problematic ways in
   television, film, and print media, more balanced and progressive
   cultural representations are arguably emerging. However, few studies
   address how disabled people and their families (e.g., parents)
   encounter, and make sense of, media configurations ostensibly designed
   to promote a more positive and visible image of living with disability.
   Drawing upon interviews with parents of children with Down's syndrome in
   the United Kingdom, I sketch out how they feel about depictions that,
   arguably, depart from hurtful historical narratives of disability as
   tragic and pitiable. Parents praise, and mostly embrace, recent
   portrayals of people with Down's syndrome in media outputs. At the same
   time, they raise concerns around tokenism, stereotyping, focusing upon
   ``exceptional{''} people, and fueling sanitized accounts which deny, or
   at least obscure, the harsh lived realities for many parents of disabled
   children. I conclude by arguing that while parents largely applaud and
   welcome positive public narratives, they also fear that such
   representations threaten to gloss over the pervasive mistreatment,
   disregard, and disenfranchisement of disabled people and their families.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we extend for the first time the spherically symmetric
   Schwarzschild and Schwarzschild-De Sitter solutions with a
   Finsler-Randers-type perturbation which is generated by a covector A
   gamma. This gives a locally anisotropic character to the metric and
   induces a deviation from theRiemannian models of gravity. Anatural
   framework for this study is the Lorentz tangent bundle of a spacetime
   manifold. We apply the generalized field equations to the perturbed
   metric and derive the dynamics for the covector A gamma. Finally, we
   find the timelike, spacelike and null paths on the Schwarzschild-Randers
   spacetime, we solve the timelike ones numerically and we compare them
   with the classic geodesics of general relativity. The obtained solutions
   are new and they enrich the corresponding literature.}},

Journal = {{JUSTICE QUARTERLY}},
Abstract = {{Despite the well-established link between homelessness and
   incarceration, very little qualitative research has focused on the
   social processes that underlie this nexus. In this article, I draw on 19
   in-depth interviews with incarcerated men who reported pre-prison
   housing instability, supplemented with 5 interviews with
   formerly-incarcerated men experiencing homelessness, to explore the
   gendered nature of the homelessness-incarceration nexus. I propose the
   concept of ``liberative instability{''}-defined as an unfettered
   lifestyle characterized by double-edged freedom and independence-to
   explore the changing meaning of homelessness in men's narratives of
   their life course. Additionally, I explore how themes of masculinity and
   liberative instability are embedded in men's narratives of freedom and
   confinement as they reflect on their experiences with homelessness and
   incarceration. These findings animate existing quantitative research by
   highlighting that the homelessness-incarceration nexus cannot be
   understood fully or disrupted without considering the significance of
   age-graded cultural scripts regarding masculinity.}},

Abstract = {{The low-energy electronic excitations of HRgCN and HRgNC (Rg = Xe, Rn)
   were computed at the TDDFT level of theory, both in the gas phase and in

   was due to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to lowest
   unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) transition (similar to 6 eV for
   HRgCN and similar to 4.5 eV for HRgNC). Cluster confinement brought
   about bathochromic shifts in the spectra and better agreement with
   experiment for HXeCN. The effects of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the
   heavier Rn systems were investigated: for HRnCN, SOC red-shifted the
   HOMO-LUMO peak, while it blue-shifted the HOMO-LUMO peak for HRnNC.
   Geometry optimizations were carried out for the HRgCN and HRgNC systems
   to locate minima and transition states for dissociation and
   isomerization. Effects of isotopic substitution on reaction rates were
   predicted. A new model core potentials basis set was introduced and
   effectiveness of several pseudopotential basis sets was studied.}},

Abstract = {{A family of polydentate pyridine-substituted pyridylidene amide (PYA)
   complexes bound to iron(II) was developed. The variation of the
   coordination set from NN-bidentate PYA to tridentate pincer-type
   pyPYA(2) systems (pyPYA(2) = 2,6-bis(PYA)pyridine) had a large influence
   on the binding mode to iron(II), including a change from the N- to rare
   O-coordination of the PYA site and a concomitant shift of the
   predominant ligand resonance structure. These binding mode variations
   invoke changes in the reactivity of the complexes, which were probed in
   the peroxide-mediated oxidation of 1-phenylethanol to acetophenone. A
   comparison with uncomplexed FeCl2 indicated that bidentate NN
   coordination is unstable and presumably leads to the dissociation of
   FeCl2. In contrast, the tridentate ligand binding is robust. Remarkably,
   the tridentate PYA pincer coordination inhibits catalytic activity in
   the NNN binding mode, while the ONO coordination greatly enhances
   catalytic performance. Under optimized conditions, the bis-ligated ONO
   pincer iron complex {[}Fe(pyPYA(2))(2)]{[}2PF(6)] reaches full
   conversion within one hour (0.5 mol\% catalyst loading) and under dilute
   conditions turnover numbers over 20 000 (0.005 mol\% catalyst loading).}},

Abstract = {{In this study, curcumin 1,4-dioxane solvates (CUR-DIO) were obtained in
   two molecular ratios of 1 : 1.5 (CUR-DIO-1.5) and 1 : 1 (CUR-DIO-1) at
   different temperatures. In the two single crystal structures, the
   molecular conformation of curcumin is a planar structure and a curved
   structure, respectively. Moreover, the length of the hydrogen bond
   between the curcumin molecule and the 1,4-dioxane molecule indicates
   that with the increase in the system temperature, the difficulty of
   solvate formation increases, the solvent ratio decreases, and the
   inter-molecular hydrogen bond energy increases. In addition, with the
   increase in temperature, the crystal morphology changes from spherulites
   to rod-shaped crystals. The hollow spherulites of CUR-DIO-1 were
   obtained at 25 degrees C, and based on the ReactRaman data and
   microscope recording, a new formation mechanism of hollow spherulites
   was proposed. The formation mechanism and preparation method of organic
   small molecule hollow spherulites will play an important role in
   promoting the application of the hollow spherulite structures in the
   fields of drug loading, slow release and multifunctional drugs.}},

Abstract = {{Nanomagnets are widely used to store information in non-volatile
   spintronic devices. Spin waves can transfer information with low-power
   consumption as their propagations are independent of charge transport.
   However, to dynamically couple two distant nanomagnets via spin waves
   remains a major challenge for magnonics. Here we experimentally
   demonstrate coherent coupling of two distant Co nanowires by fast
   propagating spin waves in an yttrium iron garnet thin film with sub-50
   nm wavelengths. Magnons in two nanomagnets are unidirectionally
   phase-locked with phase shifts controlled by magnon spin torque and
   spin-wave propagation. The coupled system is finally formulated by an
   analytical theory in terms of an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian.
   Our results are attractive for analog neuromorphic computing that
   requires unidirectional information transmission.}},

   ulcer. Serious adverse events, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS),
   are very rare. A 58-year-old man had been experiencing tarry stools and
   endoscopic evaluation revealed active duodenal ulcer bleeding. After the
   failure of endoscopic therapy, arterial embolization resulted in
   successful hemostasis. The patient was administered PPI to prevent
   recurrent ulcer bleeding. High fever and generalized skin rash developed
   on hospital day 16 and subseqnent evaluation suggested esomeprazole

   practicability of the proposed method for industrial scale problems. The
   hinge joint loads deduced from the stick's six-component cross-section
   loads identified by the new method were compared with the values
   calculated by traditional method, and the recurrence degree of stress
   and fatigue cumulative damage of the stick's fatigue critical points
   were also compared. The maximum deviation between the actual damage of
   each selected measuring point and the damage caused by the identified
   hinge joint loads was only 1.69 \%. The field test results showed that
   the new method could be conveniently applied with high identification
   accuracy for complicated actual loads.}},

   Evolution and topological protection}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC 28}},
Abstract = {{An astroid-shaped loop of exceptional points (EPs), comprising four
   cusps, is found to spawn from the triple degeneracy point in the
   Brillouin zone (BZ) of a Lieb lattice with nearest-neighbor hoppings
   when non-Hermiticity is introduced. The occurrence of the EP loop is due
   to the realness of the discriminant which is guaranteed by the
   non-Hermitian chiral symmetry. The EPs at the four cusps involve the
   coalescence of three eigenstates, which is the combined result of the
   non-Hermitian chiral symmetry and mirror-T symmetry. The EP loop is
   exactly an astroid in the limit of an infinitesimal non-Hermiticity. The
   EP loop expands from the M point with increasing non-Hermiticity and
   splits into two EP loops at a critical non-Hermiticity. The further
   increase of non-Hermiticity contracts the two EP loops towards and
   finally to two EPs at the X and Y points in the BZ, accompanied by the
   emergence of Dirac-like cones. The two EPs vanish at a larger
   non-Hermiticity. The EP loop disappears and several discrete EPs are
   found to survive when next-nearest hoppings are introduced to break the
   non-Hermitian chiral symmetry. A topological invariant called the
   discriminant number is used to characterize their robustness against
   perturbations. Both discrete EPs and those on the EP loop(s) are found
   to show anisotropic asymptotic behaviors. Finally, the experimental
   realization of the Lieb lattice using a coupled waveguide array is
   discussed.}},

   method to the terahertz optics. The calculated spectra are compared with
   the experimental measurements, showing good agreement. The detailed
   motions of the interacting electromagnetic fields and molecules occurred
   in the terahertz spectroscopies have also been provided, and the
   analyses have shown that rotational motions of the DCMBI molecules play
   key roles in the terahertz wave generation.}},

Abstract = {{The famous Kibble-Zurek mechanism offers us a significant clue to study
   quantum phase transitions out of equilibrium. Here, we investigate an
   intriguing phenomenon of a spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate
   by quenching the Raman coupling strength from a high-symmetry phase
   (nonmagnetic phase) to a low-symmetry phase (magnetic phase). When
   crossing the critical point, the fluctuation of momentum distribution
   leads to delayed bifurcation structures. Simultaneously, the domain
   information emerges in momentum space. Moreover, the universal scalings
   of spatiotemporal dynamics are extracted from the fluctuations and
   domains, which manifests homogeneous and inhomogeneous Kibble-Zurek
   power laws at different timescales. Our work demonstrates a paradigmatic
   study on the inhomogeneous Kibble-Zurek mechanism.}},

Journal = {{ARCHIVES OF AGRONOMY AND SOIL SCIENCE}},
Abstract = {{The study investigates the effect of various existing hill land-use
   practices on soil quality. The land-use types selected for the analysis
   was based on common land-use types practice in the area. Soil samples
   were collected from different land-use types and analysed for bulk
   density (BD), clay, sand, silt content, soil organic carbon, total
   nitrogen, available phosphorus, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen
   (MBC and MBN), and exchangeable cations. Further, the soil fertility
   index, soil evaluation factor and Principal Component (PC) Analysis
   suggested that PC1 accounts maximum variance (41.6\%) followed by PC2
   (19.7\%), PC3 (13.5\%), PC4 (12.4\%) and PC5 has the least variance
   (10.4\%). Weighted soil quality index (SQI(w)) was computed based on
   SQI(w.) The majority of land-use samples showed a moderate quality of
   soil except for samples of current jhum (CJ) (SQI(w) = 0.75) which is in
   the good category. Almost all the soil parameters except BD have a
   higher concentration in the settled agricultural farm owing to the
   integration of sustainable approaches (viz., integration of livestock
   manure, conservation tillage, mixed cropping and terracing). The present
   study indicates that long term settled sustainable land-uses
   agricultural practices are the key to maintain soil organic carbon, and
   soil health in the sloping hilly region of tropics.}},

Abstract = {{Iron and cobalt distannides MSn2 (M = Fe, and Co) are regarded as a
   promising conversion-type anode material for lithium- and sodium-ion
   batteries, but their properties are not well understood. In this work,
   we report a first-principles study of alkali metal (A = Li, and Na)
   substitutional effect on the structural, mechanical, lattice
   vibrational, electronic and defect properties of these distannides.
   Special attention is paid to systematic comparison between FeSn2 and
   CoSn2. Our calculations reveal that M/A substitution induces a lattice
   expansion and decrease of elastic constants, which is more pronounced
   with Na substitution than with Li, and moreover changes the elastic
   properties of FeSn2 from ductile to brittle, but preserves the ductility
   of CoSn2. An imaginary phonon frequency mode appears only for FeSn2 and
   FeNaSn2, and M/A substitution provokes a definite gap between high and
   low frequency regions. We perform a careful analysis of electronic
   density of states, band structures and Fermi surface, providing an
   insight into differences of electronic structures between FeSn2 and
   CoSn2. With further calculation of defect formation energies and alkali
   ion diffusion barriers, we believe this work can be useful to design
   conversion-type anode materials for alkali-ion batteries.}},

Abstract = {{Dual infection with two pathogens can be found in few cases of
   encephalitis. Cases of sequential infection with EBV and cryptococcal
   encephalitis in post-transplant patients are rare. We describe a
   5-year-old boy with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy who presented
   sequential infection with EBV and cryptococcal encephalitis after
   umbilical cord blood transplant. The patient showed fever, vomiting and
   emotional agitation with EBV DNA detected in CSF on day 100. The child
   underwent 3 doses of intravenous rituximab with a good response.
   However, the child presented with right facial paralysis, headache, and
   fever on day 130 after 2 weeks of clinical stability. Brain MRI
   demonstrated chronic granuloma formed with ring enhancement. FilmArray
   ME PCR confirmed the existence of Cryptococcus neoformans/gattii in the
   CSF. The child underwent sequential treatment with amphotericin liposome
   B and flucytosine. Maintenance treatment with fluconazole was
   administered for 1 year. Facial paralysis was on longer present on day
   260. Cryptococcus neoformans/gattii was not detected on day 310. The
   biochemistry and cell count of the CSF were completely normal on day
   520. Follow-up 2.5 years after presentation, brain MRI changes showed
   near complete resolution of the lesions. The child survived for 3 years
   to the last following-up. Invasive cryptococcal encephalitis is rare and
   life-threatening complication of transplantation. It is important to
   recognize dual infections, and perform treatment quickly to improve the
   prognosis of encephalitis after transplantation.}},

Journal = {{GENETIC TESTING AND MOLECULAR BIOMARKERS}},

Abstract = {{Background: Previous studies have indicated that both genetic and
   environmental factors contribute to the risk of congenital talipes
   equinovarus (CTEV). The COL9A1 gene encodes one of the three alpha
   chains of type IX collagen, which is a key collagen component of hyaline
   cartilage. Our study aimed to evaluate the effect of COL9A1 gene
   polymorphisms on susceptibility to CTEV in the Han Chinese population.
   Methods: A total of 2205 unrelated subjects comprising 692 CTEV patients
   and 1513 healthy controls were recruited. Demographic and characteristic
   information was collected, including maternal smoking and maternal
   drinking. Genetic association analyses and gene-environment interaction
   analyses were conducted based on the genotypic data of 36 tag single
   nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
   Results: Although there was no association between genotyped SNPs and
   CTEV, a gene-environment interaction signal between SNP rs6455357 and
   maternal drinking was identified. Furthermore, significant heterogeneity
   was identified for this interaction signal when stratified by maternal
   drinking. For subjects with never maternal drinking, the A allele of SNP
   rs6455357 was significantly associated with a decreased risk of CTEV. In
   contrast, the A allele was associated with an increased risk of CTEV in
   the ``occasional{''} and ``often{''} groups.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate a combined effect of genetics and
   environmental factors on the etiology of CTEV. This study increases our
   understanding of the etiology of CETV and provides useful information
   for genetic counseling for at-risk families for the development of
   prevention programs and improved management.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of macroeconomic policies on employment yields from output
   growth in sub-Saharan African countries is examined in this study. Data
   for 37 countries are used for the period 1991-2016 and sustainable
   employment yields are obtained by comparing employment elasticities for
   own-account (vulnerable) and employers (formal) groups. The two-stage
   least squares method is used to estimate employment elasticities for the
   panel datasets for three sub-periods (1991-1999, 2000-2009, 2010-2016),
   and the feasible generalised least squares method is used to estimate
   the effects of policies on employment elasticities based on a pooled
   dataset for the three sub-periods. Policy efforts are shown to be more
   effective if moved towards more flexible and targeted tax regimes, more
   rigid labour markets, and liberalised trade. On the other hand,
   investment and industrial policies do not appear to exert unidirectional
   effects on employment, especially given wide variations in government
   sizes and relative shares of domestic/foreign investment among the
   countries. There is also evidence that policy influences are more
   practicable with more formal employment groups. Patterns of
   macroeconomic policy directions are therefore critical to their
   effectiveness as labour market adjustment tools in the region.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the recent advances in manufacturing systems, the semiconductor
   FABs have become larger, and thus, more overhead hoist transporters
   (OHTs) need to be operated. In this article, we propose a cooperative
   zone-based rebalancing algorithm to allocate idle overhead hoist
   vehicles in a semiconductor FAB. The proposed model is composed of two
   parts: (i) a state representation learning part that extracts the
   localized embedding of each agent using a graph neural network; and (ii)
   a policy learning part that makes a rebalancing action using the
   constructed embedding. By conducting both representation learning and
   policy learning in a single framework, the proposed method can train the
   decentralized policy for agents to rebalance OHTs cooperatively. The
   experiments show that the proposed method can significantly reduce the
   average retrieval time while reducing the OHT utilization ratio. In
   addition, we investigated the transferable capability of the suggested
   algorithm by testing the policy on unseen dynamic scenarios without
   further training.}},

   Stumbling over Technical Barriers to Trade}},
Journal = {{JCMS-JOURNAL OF COMMON MARKET STUDIES}},
Abstract = {{Removing so-called technical barriers to trade is a critical aspect of
   contemporary deep integration trade agreements. Yet, these barriers -
   standards, regulations, conformity assessment procedures - form a set of
   institutional complementarities, named technical infrastructure, which
   performs a central role for the functioning of integrated markets.
   Drawing on evidence from the Transatlantic Trade and Investment
   Partnership (TTIP) the paper illustrates that this contradiction reduced
   the negotiators' bargaining leeway. Changing a technical infrastructure
   comes at the risk of undermining its effectiveness. Therefore, each
   party could only offer an unacceptable compromise: Transforming the
   other's technical infrastructure towards one's own technical

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{DEC 27}},
Abstract = {{Solidification treatment with cementitious binder is an effective way to
   reduce environmental hazards of sewage sludge. Two cementitious binders,
   i.e., ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and sulfo-aluminate cement (SAC),
   were compared in this study to treat the sewage sludge. The strength of
   solidified sewage sludge (SSS) and changes in microscopic
   characteristics before and after treatment were analyzed through
   microscopic analysis methods. The effect of organic matter in sludge on
   the strength of SSS were also discussed. The results showed that the
   strength of SSS were lower than that of the solidified clay with no
   organic matter, and the filtrate extracted from the sludge can also
   weaken the cementation of the two cements significantly. The
   solidification effect of the OPC on the sludge was lower than that of
   the SAC evidently. The organic matter in the sewage sludge caused the
   surface of the soil particles to carry a large negative potential, which
   interfered with the hydration of the binder and reduced the amount of
   cementation skeleton formed by the binder hydration products. This
   resulted in a porous structure with low mechanical strength. The amount
   of early hydration product formed in the SAC-based solidified samples
   was higher than that of the OPC-based samples. This was favorable for
   filling the pores of the solidified samples and increasing their
   density. SAC had a better compatibility with soft soil containing high
   organic matter than OPC, and the which provides an effective alternative
   binder for dealing with sewage sludge.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundEvidence-based family support programs such as the Triple P -
   Positive Parenting Program have the potential to enhance the well-being
   of children and families. However, they cannot achieve their expected
   outcomes if insufficient attention is paid to the implementation
   process. It has been demonstrated that practitioners' attitudes towards
   evidence-based programs (EBPs), perceived training needs and
   self-efficacy for working with parents influence implementation outcomes
   (e.g., program acceptability, adoption, adherence and sustainability).
   At the same time, the experience of being involved in the implementation
   process of an EBP could enhance practitioners' perceptions of the
   initiative. This study aimed to assess changes in practitioner's
   attitudes, perceived training needs and self-efficacy over a two-year
   EBP implementation process, in interaction with their appraisal of their
   organization's capacity to implement the EPB.MethodsIn the province of
   Quebec, Canada, Triple P was implemented and evaluated in two
   communities. Ninety-nine practitioners from various organizations
   completed questionnaires shortly before their training in Triple P and
   two years later.ResultsFindings show that practitioners who displayed
   more initial skepticism regarding their organization's capacity to
   implement the program reported greater improvements in attitudes over
   time, while practitioners who showed more optimism at baseline reported
   a greater decrease in their perceived training needs. Practitioners'
   self-efficacy increased moderately regardless of perceived
   organizational capacity.ConclusionsThese results are encouraging given
   that more positive perceptions of EBPs could foster the systematic use
   of these programs in communities, for the potential benefit of a greater
   number of families.}},

Abstract = {{Background Ovarian cancer (OC) is the gynecologic cancer with the
   highest mortality. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play a vital role in the
   development and progression of cancer. This study aimed to explore the
   potential role of circ\_0015756 in OC and its molecular mechanism.
   Methods The levels of circ\_0015756, microRNA-942-5p (miR-942-5p) and
   Cullin 4B (CUL4B) were determined by quantitative real-time PCR
   (qRT-PCR) or Western blot assay. Cell proliferation, apoptosis,
   migration and invasion were assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8),
   colony formation assay, flow cytometry and transwell assay. The levels
   of proliferation-related and metastasis-related proteins were measured
   by Western blot assay. The relationship between miR-942-5p and
   circ\_0015756 or CUL4B was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay,
   RNA immunoprecipitation assay and RNA pull-down assay. Xenograft assay
   was used to analyze tumor growth in vivo. Results Circ\_0015756 and
   CUL4B levels were increased, while miR-942-5p level was decreased in OC
   tissues and cells. Depletion of circ\_0015756 suppressed proliferation,
   migration and invasion and promoted apoptosis in OC cells.
   Down-regulation of circ\_0015756 hindered OC cell progression via
   modulating miR-942-5p. Also, up-regulation of miR-942-5p impeded OC cell
   development by targeting CUL4B. Mechanistically, circ\_0015756
   up-regulated CUL4B via sponging miR-942-5p. Moreover, circ\_0015756
   silencing inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Conclusion Knockdown of
   circ\_0015756 suppressed OC progression via regulating miR-942-5p/CUL4B
   axis, suggesting that circ\_0015756 might be a potential therapeutic
   target for ovarian cancer.}},

Title = {{Memory kernel reconstruction problems in the integro-differential
   equation of rigid heat conductor}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN THE APPLIED SCIENCES}},
Abstract = {{The inverse problems of determining the energy-temperature relation
   alpha(t) and the heat conduction relation k(t) functions in the
   one-dimensional integro-differential heat equation are investigated. The
   direct problem is the initial-boundary problem for this equation. The
   integral terms have the time convolution form of unknown kernels and
   direct problem solution. As additional information for solving inverse
   problems, the solution of the direct problem for x = x(0) is given. At
   the beginning, an auxiliary problem, which is equivalent to the original
   problem, is introduced. Then the auxiliary problem is reduced to an
   equivalent closed system of Volterra-type integral equations with
   respect to unknown functions. Applying the method of contraction
   mappings to this system in the continuous class of functions with
   weighted norms, we prove the main result of the article, which is a
   global existence and uniqueness theorem of inverse problem solutions.}},

Title = {{Tree Ring-Based Historic Hydroclimatic Variability of the Baja
   California Peninsula}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{125}},

Abstract = {{The Baja California Peninsula is one of the most arid regions in Mexico,
   receiving an average of only 168 mm of precipitation annually. Climate
   change scenarios project drier and warmer conditions in the region at
   the end of this century driven by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse
   gases. The growing demand for limited water supplies and the impacts of
   climate change pose a challenge to manage the already scarce water
   resources in the Peninsula. Analysis of historical hydroclimatic
   variability in the Peninsula is limited because most of the early
   instrumental climate data collection started only in the 1950s. In this
   study, we reconstruct past precipitation variability for the Peninsula
   using two tree ring chronologies from northern (Pinus monophylla) and
   southern (Pinus lagunae) Baja California. Our two reconstructions
   document multicentury hydroclimatic variability in the Peninsula,
   including events that turned out to be more extreme than those captured
   by modern instrumental records. Drought episodes are longer, more
   frequent, and more intense in the northern peninsula compared to the
   southern region. Multiyear dry and wet events in our two reconstructions
   exhibit broad spatial extent, affecting most of northwest Mexico and the
   western United States, which are mainly caused by broad-scale
   atmospheric circulation patterns such as El Nino-Southern Oscillation
   (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The results of this study
   allow framing current and projected droughts in a longer-term context,
   thus providing a better understanding of past climate variability and a
   basis for robust water resource management in the region.}},

Title = {{The Family Context of Toddler Sleep: Routines, Sleep Environment, and

Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Family processes during the pre-bedtime period likely have a crucial
   influence on toddler sleep, but relatively little previous research has
   focused on family process in this context. The current study examined
   several aspects of family process during the pre-bedtime period,
   including the use of bedtime routines, the qualities of the child's home
   sleep environment, and the promotion of child emotional security, in
   families of 30-month-old toddlers (N= 546; 265 female) who were part of
   a multi-site longitudinal study of toddler development. These
   characteristics were quantified using a combination of parent- and
   observer-reports and examined in association with child sleep using
   correlation and multiple regression. Child sleep was assessed using
   actigraphy to measure sleep duration, timing, variability, activity, and
   latency. Bedtime routines were examined using parents' daily records.
   Home sleep environment and emotional security induction were quantified
   based on observer ratings and in-home observation notes, respectively.
   All three measures of pre-bedtime context (i.e., bedtime routine
   inconsistency, poor quality sleep environments, and emotional security
   induction) were correlated with various aspects of child sleep
   (significant correlations:.11-.22). The most robust associations
   occurred between the pre-bedtime context measures and sleep timing
   (i.e., the timing of the child's sleep schedule) and variability (i.e.,
   night to night variability in sleep timing and duration). Pre-bedtime
   variables, including bedtime routine consistency, home sleep environment
   quality, and positive emotional security induction, also mediated the
   association between family socioeconomic status and child sleep. Our
   findings underscore the value of considering family context when
   examining individual differences in child sleep.}},

Title = {{Alloying of Alkali Metals with Tellurene}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Graphite anodes offer low volumetric capacity in lithium-ion batteries.
   By contrast, tellurene is expected to alloy with alkali metals with high
   volumetric capacity (approximate to 2620 mAh cm(-3)), but to date there
   is no detailed study on its alloying behavior. In this work, the
   alloying response of a range of alkali metals (A = Li, Na, or K) with
   few-layer Te is investigated. In situ transmission electron microscopy
   and density functional theory both indicate that Te alloys with alkali
   metals forming A(2)Te. However, the crystalline order of alloyed
   products varies significantly from single-crystal (for Li2Te) to
   polycrystalline (for Na2Te and K2Te). Typical alloying materials lose
   their crystallinity when reacted with Li-the ability of Te to retain its
   crystallinity is therefore surprising. Simulations reveal that compared
   to Na or K, the migration of Li is highly ``isotropic{''} in Te,
   enabling its crystallinity to be preserved. Such isotropic Li transport
   is made possible by Te's peculiar structure comprising chiral-chains
   bound by van der Waals forces. While alloying with Na and K show poor
   performance, with Li, Te exhibits a stable volumetric capacity of
   approximate to 700 mAh cm(-3), which is about twice the practical
   capacity of commercial graphite.}},

Title = {{Application of the trans-contextual model to predict change in leisure
   time physical activity}},
Journal = {{PSYCHOLOGY \& HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   This study tested effects of changes in the psychological constructs of
   the trans-contextual model (TCM) on changes in adolescents' outside of
   school moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (PA) measured using
   self-report and accelerometer-based device.
   Design
   A three-wave longitudinal design was used. High school students (N =
   331) completed measures of all the TCM constructs at Time1 and at Time2,
   five weeks apart. Self-reported PA behaviour was measured also at Time3,
   five weeks after Time2. PA was measured using accelerometer-based
   devices for seven days following Time1 and Time3 for a census week.
   Results
   A structural equation model using residual change scores revealed that
   perceived autonomy support from physical education (PE) teachers
   positively predicted autonomous motivation in PE. Autonomous motivation
   in PE positively predicted autonomous motivation in leisure time.
   Leisure-time autonomous motivation was positively and indirectly related
   to intention, mediated by attitude and perceived behavioural control.
   Intention positively predicted self-reported PA, and mediated the effect
   of autonomous motivation on self-reported PA. There were no effects on
   outside of school PA measured by accelerometer-based device.
   Conclusions
   Results provide qualified support for the TCM in the prediction of
   change in adolescents' leisure-time autonomous motivation, intention,
   and self-reported PA, but not change in PA measured by
   accelerometer-based device.}},

Abstract = {{Metaethical realists believe that moral facts exist, but they disagree
   among themselves about whether moral facts have ontological import.
   Robust realists think that they do. Quietist realists deny this. I argue
   that quietist realism faces a new objection; viz., the moral
   determination objection. This is the objection that general moral facts
   (or moral principles) must determine specific moral facts (or which
   actions in the world are right and wrong) but that general moral facts
   cannot do this if they lack ontological import. I also argue that some
   robust realists can answer the moral determination objection. This gives
   these robust realists an edge over quietist realism.}},

Abstract = {{Object counting is a fundamental and essential task to build the
   high-level cognition for the given scene in the computer vision field.
   For the common scale variant issue in the object counting, this paper
   designs a deeply scale aggregation network for object counting task.
   Specially, we design a dense multi-scale (DMS) block to extract the
   initial scale-aware feature, and thus stack multiple DMS blocks in the
   specific structure to implement the adaptive network depth, so as to
   learn the more mighty scale-aware feature. Extensive experimental
   results are reported in this paper, using up to six public object
   counting benchmarks, which demonstrate that the proposed method has an
   effective performance for object counting task. And the ablation studies

Abstract = {{Deciphering the dynamic changes in antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 is
   essential for understanding the immune response in COVID-19 patients.
   Here we analyze the laboratory findings of 1,850 patients to describe
   the dynamic changes of the total antibody, spike protein (S)-,
   receptor-binding domain (RBD)-, and nucleoprotein (N)-specific
   immunoglobulin M (IgM) and G (IgG) levels during SARS-CoV-2 infection
   and recovery. The generation of S-, RBD-, and N-specific IgG occurs one
   week later in patients with severe/critical COVID-19 compared to
   patients with mild/moderate disease, while S- and RBD-specific IgG
   levels are 1.5-fold higher in severe/critical patients during
   hospitalization. The RBD-specific IgG levels are 4-fold higher in older
   patients than in younger patients during hospitalization. In addition,
   the S- and RBD-specific IgG levels are 2-fold higher in the recovered
   patients who are SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative than those who are RNA
   positive. Lower S-, RBD-, and N-specific IgG levels are associated with
   a lower lymphocyte percentage, higher neutrophil percentage, and a
   longer duration of viral shedding. Patients with low antibody levels on
   discharge might thereby have a high chance of being tested positive for
   SARS-CoV-2 RNA after recovery. Our study provides important information
   for COVID-19 diagnosis, treatment, and vaccine development.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Mesoporous silica materials, with high specific surface area,
   tailorable pore size and excellent chemical stability, have wide
   prospects for application in catalyst carriers. In this work,
   aldehyde-modified silica materials were first prepared through
   silanization reaction of N-{[}3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]ethylenediamine
   and then Schiff base reaction of glutaraldehyde. Subsequently, the
   resulting materials were used for immobilization of naringinase.
   RESULTS The results demonstrated that the activity of immobilized
   naringinase was optimized as 352.83 U g(-1) support. The optimal
   immobilization conditions were determined as follows: immobilization
   temperature of 30 degrees C, immobilization time of 3 h, pH of 3.5 and
   initial naringinase activity of 200.75 U mL(-1). In addition, at the
   optimal reaction temperature of 50 degrees C and pH of 8.0, the
   percentage of immobilization, naringinase activity recovery and
   naringinase activity of the immobilized naringinase reached 56.41\%,
   93.42\% and 423.22 U g(-1) support, respectively. Besides, comparing
   with free naringinase, in the process of naringin hydrolysis, the
   immobilized naringinase exhibited wide pH application range and good
   thermal stability, and still maintained 71.13\% residual naringinase
   activity after 1 month of storage. Even more important, the immobilized
   naringinase could controllably transform naringin to prunin as the only
   hydrolysis product, and no naringenin was detected, which represents a
   new route for controllable preparation of prunin.
   CONCLUSIONS This study provides an ideal carrier material and some basic
   data for naringinase immobilization technology, which will greatly
   promote the application of naringinase and the development of the
   pharmaceutical industry. (c) 2020 Society of Chemical Industry}},

Abstract = {{The uncertainties in tire cornering stiffness can degrade the path
   following the performance of autonomous vehicles, especially in low
   adhesive conditions, to deal with this problem, a novel multi-model
   adaptive predictive control is proposed in this study. Firstly, a model
   predictive path following controller is designed based on a combined
   model of vehicle dynamics and road-related kinematics relationship.
   Then, to deal with the model uncertainties, the multiple model adaptive
   theory is introduced, and the recursive least adaptive law is proposed
   with its convergence proved by Lyapunov theory. Finally, the
   multiple-model adaptive law is combined with the proposed model
   predictive control by a convex polytope of tire cornering stiffness. In
   this way, the proposed algorithm can be adaptive to the uncertainties of
   tire cornering stiffness. Simulation results show the effectiveness and
   robustness of the proposed method to the uncertainties of the tire
   cornering stiffness resulting in an excellent performance in any road

Abstract = {{Invasive meningococcal disease causes significant morbidity and
   mortality worldwide, with serogroup B being one of the predominant
   serogroups in Australia for many years. The South Australian (SA) State
   Government recently funded the introduction of a 4CMenB vaccination
   program for infants, children and adolescents. In addition to protecting
   against invasive meningococcal disease, emerging evidence suggests the
   4CMenB vaccine may also be effective against gonorrhoea due to genetic
   similarities between Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
   The proposed project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the SA 4CMenB
   vaccination program against invasive meningococcal disease and
   gonorrhoea through a combination of observational studies using routine
   surveillance and research data. The main methodological approaches
   involve an interrupted time series regression model, screening, and
   case-control analyses with different sets of controls to estimate
   vaccine impact and effectiveness. These analyses are designed to
   minimize potential biases inherent in all observational studies and to
   provide critical data on the effectiveness of the 4CMenB vaccine against
   two diseases of major global public health concern.}},

Journal = {{CUREUS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 27}},
Abstract = {{We report a case of a giant inguinal hernia (GIH) that underwent open
   surgical repair with mesh. The patient had a massive transcompartmental
   redistribution of abdominal contents from the abdominopelvic cavity to
   the hernia sac in the scrotum, with subsequent effects on the mechanical
   nature of the abdominal wall muscles. Repair of this type of giant
   hernia is challenging as it can raise the intra-abdominal pressure,
   therefore increasing the risk of abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS).
   The large size and chronicity of the hernia, associated with deranged
   mechanical forces/properties of the abdominal wall, made the management
   of this complex case unique and interesting. In similar cases of massive
   incisional or ventral hernias, the term ``loss of domain{''} (LOD) is
   used. In such types of massive hernias, it is important to carefully
   plan and monitor for adverse physiological effects associated with
   increased abdominal pressure.}},

Title = {{Application of Sustainable Textile Finishing Using Natural Biomolecules}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL FIBERS}},
Abstract = {{The textile processing and finishing industry is the mainstay for the
   apparel segment. The textile processing and finishing industry consume
   an enormous amount of chemicals and release harmful substances to the
   environment. Therefore rethinking and refinement of the practice adopted
   and the techniques involved in processing and finishing are very much
   significant. The consciousness toward environmental protection,
   pollution control, and user-friendliness are the reasons for emerging
   trends with sustainable concepts where natural materials, plant
   ingredients, plant extracts can be used for textile finishing. This
   review paper discusses the exploratory qualitative study about the
   natural ingredients, extraction processes, finishing on textiles for
   various applications, its effects, and results. The applications of
   textile finishing processes covered in this article are fragrance
   finish, bio-polishing, bio-stone washing, insect repellent, and UV
   protection. This article also deals with the various methods of
   finishing textiles using natural products such as pad-dry-cure,
   microencapsulation, exhaust method, spraying technique, etc., and its
   implications. The finishing process using natural products has obtained
   satisfactory results with various tests for analyzing the properties of
   textiles after finishing. The critical analysis of this article has
   revealed that the textile finishing process using natural products seem
   to be economical, sustainable, have control over environmental and
   health hazard.}},

Title = {{Transcription-dependent cohesin repositioning rewires chromatin loops in
   cellular senescence}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 27}},
Abstract = {{Senescence is a state of stable proliferative arrest, generally
   accompanied by the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, which
   modulates tissue homeostasis. Enhancer-promoter interactions,
   facilitated by chromatin loops, play a key role in gene regulation but
   their relevance in senescence remains elusive. Here, we use Hi-C to show
   that oncogenic RAS-induced senescence in human diploid fibroblasts is
   accompanied by extensive enhancer-promoter rewiring, which is closely
   connected with dynamic cohesin binding to the genome. We find de novo
   cohesin peaks often at the 3 end of a subset of active genes.
   RAS-induced de novo cohesin peaks are transcription-dependent and
   enriched for senescence-associated genes, exemplified by IL1B, where de
   novo cohesin binding is involved in new loop formation. Similar IL1B
   induction with de novo cohesin appearance and new loop formation are
   observed in terminally differentiated macrophages, but not TNF
   alpha-treated cells. These results suggest that RAS-induced senescence
   represents a cell fate determination-like process characterised by a
   unique gene expression profile and 3D genome folding signature, mediated
   in part through cohesin redistribution on chromatin.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundThis study aimed to investigate psychological distress among

   (COVID-19) outbreak in the Republic of Korea.MethodsUsing an
   online-based survey link sent via text message and email, we conducted a
   survey from April 21 to 25, 2020, targeting all ID physicians currently
   working in ID (n=265). The questionnaire was based on the Maslach
   Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey and the Depression, Anxiety, and
   Stress Scales, and information was collected on factors protecting
   against psychological distress and difficulties in relation to
   COVID-19.ResultsOf 265 ID physicians, 115 (43.3\%) responded, showing
   burnout (97, 90.4\%), depression (20, 17.4\%), anxiety (23, 20.0\%), and
   stress (5, 4.3\%). There were no differences in terms of distress
   between ID physicians who were directly involved in the care of patients
   with COVID-19 or not. Greater than 50\% of physicians valued their work
   and felt recognized by others, whereas <10\% indicated that sufficient
   human and financial support and private time had been provided during
   the outbreak. The most challenging issues concerned a lack of attending
   physicians caring for COVID-19 patients or infection control
   practitioners, a shortage of personal protective equipment or airborne
   infection isolation rooms, pressure for research, and lack of guidelines
   for COVID-19 management.ConclusionsDuring the COVID-19 outbreak in the
   Republic of Korea, most respondents reported psychological distress.
   Preparing strategies to secure human resources are crucial to prepare

Abstract = {{Understanding the mechanisms underlying species divergence remains a
   central goal in evolutionary biology. Landscape genetics can be a
   powerful tool for examining evolutionary processes. We used genome-wide
   scans to genotype samples from populations of eight Angophora species.
   Angophora is a small genus within the eucalypts comprising common and
   rare species in a heterogeneous landscape, making it an appropriate
   group to study speciation. We found A. hispida was highly differentiated
   from the other species. Two subspecies of A. costata (subsp. costata and
   subsp. euryphylla) formed a group, while the third (subsp. leiocarpa,
   which is only distinguished by its smooth fruits and provenance) was
   supported as a distinct pseudocryptic species. Other species that are
   morphologically distinct could not be genetically differentiated (e.g.,
   A. floribunda and A. subvelutina). Distribution and genetic
   differentiation within Angophora were strongly influenced by temperature
   and humidity, as well as biogeographic barriers, particularly rivers and
   higher elevation regions. While extensive introgression was found
   between many populations of some species (e.g., A. bakeri and A.
   floribunda), others only hybridized at certain locations. Overall, our
   findings suggest multiple mechanisms drove evolutionary diversification
   in Angophora and highlight how genome-wide analyses of related species
   in a diverse landscape can provide insights into speciation.}},

Abstract = {{Blood fruit is an underutilized and highly nutritious fruit available in
   the Northeastern part of India. Proper design and development of sorting
   and grading systems help in improving the utilization of the fruit.
   Mass-based grading is more economical than the size-based grading of
   fruits. The main aim of this study is to investigate the physical,
   biochemical, thermal, and textural properties of blood fruit and also to
   determine the best models for predicting the mass of blood fruit using
   its physical properties. Various physical properties include dimensions,
   diameters, area, and volume were measured. The fruit is also a good
   source of phytochemicals like total phenolic compounds (678.21 +/-
   10.71), flavonoids (489.80 +/- 6.72), and anthocyanins (581.21 +/-
   5.31), respectively. Four different empirical models such as linear,
   quadratic, power, and s-curve were used to correlate the mass of blood
   fruit with its physical properties. Fruit width and projected area
   perpendicular to width in the quadratic model and ellipsoidal volume in
   the linear model were found best based on the highest R2 for predicting
   the mass of blood fruit. The present study would significantly increase
   the knowledge base and useful to design and fabricate postharvest
   equipment like graders and sorters, which in turn increases the value
   and commercialization of the fruit.}},

Journal = {{CITIZENSHIP STUDIES}},

Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{72-89}},
Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{This article asks how pro-European activism relates to the idea of
   European citizenship. Its ambition is to evaluate recent mobilisations
   in light of an activist understanding of citizenship and relate them to
   a broader dynamic of reframing political space. Despite its ambivalent
   founding in market integration, EU citizenship as a legal status has a
   political potential which has hardly been sufficiently discussed.
   Exploring the performative as well as polity-constituting dimension of
   enactments of European citizenship, the article elaborates on the role
   of narratives and imaginaries of democratic founding that are the basis
   for political mobilisation. Reflecting on recent attempts to transfer
   the idea of constituent power to a transnational setting, it suggests a
   reinterpretation which incorporates the inherent paradoxical dimension
   of enactment and representation. `Constitutive moments' are sequences of
   rupture rather than single events, creating narratives of shared past
   and future, which reach out to construct new commonalities.}},

Title = {{Criteria for the progressive initiation and propagation of radial and
   axial fractures of borehole during rock hydraulic fracturing}},
Journal = {{ENERGY SOURCES PART A-RECOVERY UTILIZATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS}},
Abstract = {{The behavior of hydraulic fractures initiated along the radial and axial
   directions of borehole has been investigated by the author in previous
   hydraulic fracturing experimental and engineering applications. Based on
   this, and considering the stress fields at the tips of fractures, a
   mechanical model of the progressive initiation and propagation of radial
   and axial hydraulic fractures in the borehole is established in this
   paper. Subsequently, based on the mechanical model, criteria for the
   progressive initiation and propagation of radial and axial hydraulic
   fractures are postulated. According to the criteria, the axial fracture
   begins at the midpoint of the radial fracture. When the second and third
   principal stresses near the axial fracture tip are equal, the axial
   fracture begins to turn. Finally, through an actual triaxial fracturing
   experiment, the injection pressure curve and internal fracture shape of
   a test block were obtained, which are the discrimination factors of the
   criteria. The fracture initiation pressure of the radial and axial
   fractures of the test block satisfied the fracture initiation condition
   of the criteria. The accuracy of the criteria in predicting the turning
   position of the axial fracture was 89.6\% in comparison to the
   experimental data. Radial and axial fractures can propagate horizontally
   and longitudinally on the hard roof to fully break it, which provides a
   new idea and essential theoretical basis for the control of the end
   hanging roof of coal mining face.}},

Abstract = {{Ubiquitous pockmarks in continental margins are important to understand
   the tectonic and sedimentary history and flow activity of their host
   margins. The study of an extensive field of pockmarks in the South China
   Sea (SCS) is important both scientifically and economically, for the
   exploration of oil, gas, and gas hydrate resources and the prevention
   and control of marine geological disasters. We report our new findings
   on the characteristics, distribution, and genesis of pockmarks in the
   SCS based on interpretation of high-resolution multibeam bathymetric
   data and multichannel seismic profiles collected in the past decade.
   Three pockmark fields (total area 572,824 km(2)), are recognized in the
   northern, western, and southern continental margins of the SCS. The
   pockmarks are highly variable in shape: circular, elliptical,
   crescent-shaped, elongated or forming a chain in plan view and U-, V- or
   W-shaped in cross-section. Pockmarks are normally 10-200 m in diameter,
   with maximum diameters/axial lengths of 7.3 km for circular, 5.5 km for
   elliptical, 8.6 km for crescent-shaped, 9.5 km for elongated, and 30 km
   for chain-type pockmarks. Pockmarks are normally less than 35 m deep,
   with a maximum depth of 341 m at the southwestern SCS margin. These
   pockmarks might have originated from methane seepages or from pore
   fluids from deeper sources, which migrated vertically along gas
   chimneys, mud diapirs, mud volcanoes, faults or buried channels. In
   addition to possible structural controls, the pockmark morphologies are
   affected by bottom currents.}},

   available data from 2557 PCCM physicians from the National Provider
   Index registry. We analyzed data on a systematic sample of 690 PCCM
   physicians representing 62 fellowship programs. There was substantial
   diversity in the characteristics of fellowship training programs in
   terms of fellowship size, intensive care unit (ICU) bed numbers, age of
   program, location, research rank of affiliated medical school, and
   academic metrics based on publication productivity of their graduates
   standardized over time. The clinical and academic attributes of
   fellowship training programs were associated with publication success
   and characteristics of their graduates' employment hospital. Programs
   with greater publication rate per graduate had more ICU beds and were
   associated with higher ranked medical schools. At the physician level,
   training program attributes including larger size, older program, and
   higher academic metrics were associated with graduates with greater
   publication productivity. There were varied characteristics of current
   employment hospitals, with graduates fromlarger, more academic

Abstract = {{The development of Intelligence Studies has provided new and exciting
   insights into war, societies, ideologies, institutions, and even
   cultures and mindsets, even if the geographical reach of these studies
   has been largely limited to the West. One area that remains under- 10
   studied in general is that of insurgent intelligence, thereby
   underplaying the significance of a factor that can be pivotal in any
   armed conflict. This is particularly the case with regard to Africa. We
   still know very little about the role of insurgent intelligence
   apparatuses in this region, much less their perceptions 15 and mental
   models of the world at large. This article seeks to address this
   situation by providing a case study of the Sudan People's Liberation
   Army (SPLA). It draws on John Gentry's framework for analysing non-state
   actor intelligence to set out the characteristics of the SPLA as an
   intelligence actor and to better understand its 20 trajectory.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper describes the design of a folded hairpin-line bandpass
   filter centred at 2.5 GHz applicable for Wireless Local Area Network
   (WLAN) with improved spurious suppression. The size of the conventional
   filter has been reduced by 30\% by folding the open-end arms towards the
   inward direction. Thus, improvements over the skirt characteristics and
   shifting of the second harmonic to higher frequency region have been
   obtained. However, the attenuation level at the harmonic frequency
   remains almost unaffected. Subsequently, the inner and outer edges of
   the coupled-lines have been modified with Minkowski fractals to
   compensate for the modal phase velocities. As a result, more than 36 dB
   of harmonic suppression up to three times the centre frequency along
   with size reduction of 30\% has been achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Lipid profile (total cholesterol and lipoprotein fractions) has been
   found to correlate with depression and cognitive impairment across the
   lifespan. However, the role of lipid levels in self-rated depressive
   state and cognitive impairment remains unclear. In this study, we
   examined the relationship between lipid profile (total cholesterol,
   triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density
   lipoprotein cholesterol) and cognition in adults with and without
   self-rated depression. Four hundred and thirty-eight healthy
   participants completed the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of
   Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), the Self-Rating Depression Scale
   (SDS), and a serum lipoprotein test. Using multivariate ANOVA, partial
   correlation and network analysis, a network linking lipoprotein profile,
   depressive state and cognition was constructed. A significant difference
   in serum lipid profile between the high and low depressive groups was
   detected. Depressive state had a strong negative correlation with
   cognitive performance. Of the lipid profile, only high-density
   lipoprotein was positively correlated with depressive symptom severity,
   whereas the other three indices showed negative correlation with both
   depressive state and cognitive performance. Our results suggest that
   serum lipid profile may be directly linked to self-rated depression and
   cognitive performance. Further studies recruiting larger clinical
   samples are needed to elucidate the specific effect of lipoprotein on
   cognitive impairment in mood disorder.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundColorectal adenocarcinoma (CRA) is one of the leading causes
   of cancer-related deaths in the world. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)
   have been implicated to be effective regulators in the disease course of
   human cancers, including CRA. Small nucleolar RNA host gene 17 (SNHG17)
   belongs to lncRNAs, and it has been reported in breast cancer and
   gastric cancer. However, the function of SNHG17 and its mechanism in CRA
   progression remain largely unknown. In this study, we attended to
   shedding some light on the role of SNHG17 in CRA.MethodsRT-qPCR was used
   to assess SNHG17 expression in CRA cells. CCK-8 assay, colony formation
   and transwell assay were carried out to detect the regulatory effect of
   SNHG17 silencing on CRA cell proliferation and migration. The
   angiogenesis of SNHG7-downregulated CRA cells was analyzed by tube
   formation assay. Mechanism experiments were conducted to identify the
   interaction between miR-23a-3p and SNHG17 or C-X-C motif chemokine
   ligand 12 (CXCL12).ResultsSNHG17 possessed with high expression in CRA
   cells. Knockdown of SNHG17 caused the inhibition on CRA cell
   proliferation and migration. SNHG17 promoted CRA cell proliferation and
   migration by sponging miR-23a-3p to upregulate CXCL12.ConclusionSNHG17
   promotes the proliferation and migration of CRA cells by inhibiting
   miR-23a-3p to modulate CXCL12-mediated angiogenesis.}},

Title = {{Preparation techniques of thin cyanoacrylate adhesive films for
   interface analysis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ADHESION}},
Abstract = {{For understanding the interactions between adhesives and different
   surfaces, the in-situ characterization of the interface is essential.
   Especially for highly reactive cyanoacrylates, better known as super
   glues, the adhesion mechanism is poorly understood because, among other
   things, the characterization of the interface is difficult. The aim of
   this work is to evaluate methods to produce nm-thin, homogeneous films
   of cyanoacrylate to enable spectroscopic analysis of the interface in
   the future. Two deposition techniques, thermal evaporation and spin
   coating, of ethyl-cyanoacrylate, are compared. Thickness and composition
   of the cured films are investigated by atomic force microscopy, laser
   scanning microscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Thermal
   evaporation in ultra-high vacuum leads to cluster-like depositions and
   is therefore not suitable for interface analysis. Spin coating is
   strongly dependent on solvent and concentration. While the solvent
   tetrahydrofuran leads to porous and inhomogeneous films, spin coating
   with anisole as solvent provides homogeneous films of cyanoacrylate with
   a thickness of only 4 nm. This allows surface-sensitive analytical
   methods to access the interface and possible interactions can be
   characterized in-situ.}},

   This case may well present an exceptional coincidence, but may describe
   a yet unrecognized feature of the spectrum of childhood onset
   cryopyrinopathies that contribute to the understanding of the genetic
   basis for anti-MOG antibody positive encephalomyelitis. Based on this
   observation, a larger scale study investigating the role of NLRP3 and
   other inflammasomes in this entity would provide important
   pathophysiological insights and potentially novel avenues for treatment.}},

   the behavior at infinity of such fluid flows. After a review of the
   fundamental solutions of several differential operators, we obtain a
   general expression for the Oseen fundamental solution without making any
   restrictions on the magnitude and orientation of zeta. The existence of
   a wake region and the anisotropic behavior of the fluid flow are then
   explained by simplified expressions and precise estimates of the
   velocity component. Using a trivial extension of the velocity and
   pressure to the whole space and the framework of tempered distributions,
   we also deduce the integral representation and the asymptotic expansion
   of weak solutions of the Oseen exterior problem.}},

   attempts were made in turning of AISI 304 under cryogenic, dry, and
   combination of cryo-MQL conditions with conventional (without texture)
   tools. In the present research work, different microgroove angles 90

   Further, experimental results were compared with untextured tools under
   MQL and wet cooling, respectively. From the results, the T-1 tool with

Abstract = {{Accurate prediction of suicide risk among children and adolescents
   within an actionable time frame is an important but challenging task.
   Very few studies have comprehensively considered the clinical risk
   factors available to produce quantifiable risk scores for estimation of
   short- and long-term suicide risk for pediatric population. In this
   paper, we built machine learning models for predicting suicidal behavior
   among children and adolescents based on their longitudinal clinical
   records, and determining short- and long-term risk factors. This
   retrospective study used deidentified structured electronic health
   records (EHR) from the Connecticut Children's Medical Center covering
   the period from 1 October 2011 to 30 September 2016. Clinical records of
   41,721 young patients (10-18 years old) were included for analysis.
   Candidate predictors included demographics, diagnosis, laboratory tests,
   and medications. Different prediction windows ranging from 0 to 365 days
   were adopted. For each prediction window, candidate predictors were
   first screened by univariate statistical tests, and then a predictive
   model was built via a sequential forward feature selection procedure. We
   grouped the selected predictors and estimated their contributions to
   risk prediction at different prediction window lengths. The developed
   predictive models predicted suicidal behavior across all prediction
   windows with AUCs varying from 0.81 to 0.86. For all prediction windows,
   the models detected 53-62\% of suicide-positive subjects with 90\%
   specificity. The models performed better with shorter prediction windows
   and predictor importance varied across prediction windows, illustrating
   short- and long-term risks. Our findings demonstrated that routinely
   collected EHRs can be used to create accurate predictive models for
   suicide risk among children and adolescents.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanisms of carotenoid accumulation in yellow-fleshed sweetpotato
   cultivars are unclear. In this study, we compared the transcriptome
   profiles of a yellow-fleshed cultivar, Beniharuka (BH) and two of its
   spontaneous white-fleshed mutants (WH2 and WH3) to reveal the genes
   involved in yellow flesh. As a result of RNA sequencing, a total of 185
   differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were commonly detected in WH2 and
   WH3 compared to BH. Of these genes, 85 DEGs and 100 DEGs were commonly
   upregulated and downregulated in WH2 and WH3 compared to BH,
   respectively. g1103.t1, a paralog of zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP), was
   only DEG common to WH2 and WH3 among 38 genes considered to be involved
   in carotenoid biosynthesis in storage roots. The expression level of
   g1103.t1 was also considerably lower in five white-fleshed cultivars
   than in five yellow-fleshed cultivars. Analysis of carotenoid
   composition in the storage roots showed that the epoxidised carotenoids
   were drastically reduced in both WH2 and WH3. Therefore, we propose that
   the ZEP paralog, g1103.t1, may be involved in carotenoid accumulation
   through the epoxidation of beta -carotene and beta -cryptoxanthin in
   sweetpotato.}},

Abstract = {{A recent clinical study demonstrated that haemodialysis with a dialysate
   containing hydrogen (H-2) improves blood pressure control in end-stage
   kidney disease. Herein, we examined whether H-2 has a salutary effect on
   hypertension in animal models. We subjected 5/6 nephrectomised rats to
   inhalation of either H-2 (1.3\% H-2+21\% O-2+77.7\% N-2) or control
   (21\% O-2+79\% N-2) gas mixture for 1 h per day. H-2 significantly
   suppressed increases in blood pressure after 5/6 nephrectomy. The
   anti-hypertensive effect of H-2 was also confirmed in rats in a stable
   hypertensive state 3 weeks after nephrectomy. To examine the detailed
   effects of H-2 on hypertension, we used an implanted telemetry system to
   continuously monitor blood pressure. H-2 exerted an anti-hypertensive
   effect not only during daytime rest, but also during night-time
   activities. Spectral analysis of blood pressure variability revealed
   that H-2 improved autonomic imbalance, namely by suppressing the overly
   active sympathetic nervous system and augmenting parasympathetic nervous
   system activity; these effects co-occurred with the blood
   pressure-lowering effect. In conclusion, 1-h daily exposure to H-2
   exerts an anti-hypertensive effect in an animal model of hypertension.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the study was to produce biodiesel from animal oil as
   non-edible feedstock. Three different concentrations of oils were used
   to produce the biodiesel. The main characteristic of these oils was
   high-free fatty acid content. The oils were transesterified with acid
   and basic catalysts, respectively. Biodiesel yield of 90 wt.\% was
   obtained by acid transesterification (9 wt.\% HCl, 6:1 methanol: oil
   molar ratio, 60 degrees C, 46 h). Pre-esterification conditions were
   studied using different oils and acid catalysts: 0.6 wt.\% HCl, 6:1
   methanol: oil molar ratio at 60 degrees C for 4 h, and this resulted in
   oil with an acid value of less than 0.8\%. Under similar
   transesterification conditions, alkali transesterification of esterified
   fats resulted in the yield of 97.2 wt.\% esters. Biodiesel properties
   were determined and most of the properties were within EN 14214 and ASTM
   D6751. Biodiesel from animal fats is less stable for oxidation and this
   is due to the absence of natural antioxidants as compared to the
   biodiesel of vegetable origin. For this reason, biodiesel produced from
   animal fats might not be adequate to use at 100\% pure in vehicles
   during cold weather.}},

Title = {{Intertwined density waves in a metallic nickelate}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 26}},
Abstract = {{Nickelates are a rich class of materials, ranging from insulating
   magnets to superconductors. But for stoichiometric materials, insulating
   behavior is the norm, as for most late transition metal oxides. Notable
   exceptions are the 3D perovskite LaNiO3, an unconventional paramagnetic
   metal, and the layered Ruddlesden-Popper phases R4Ni3O10, (R=La, Pr,
   Nd). The latter are particularly intriguing because they exhibit an
   unusual metal-to-metal transition. Here, we demonstrate that this
   transition results from an incommensurate density wave with both charge
   and magnetic character that lies closer in its behavior to the metallic
   density wave seen in chromium metal than the insulating stripes
   typically found in single-layer nickelates like La2-xSrxNiO4. We
   identify these intertwined density waves as being Fermi surface-driven,
   revealing a novel ordering mechanism in this nickelate that reflects a
   coupling among charge, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom that differs
   not only from the single-layer materials, but from the 3D perovskites as
   well. Layered Ruddlesden-Popper structure nickelates R4Ni3O10 (R=La,Pr)
   show an unusual metal-to-metal transition, but its origin has remained
   elusive for more than two decades. Here, the authors show that this
   transition results from intertwined density waves that arise from a
   coupling between charge and spin degrees of freedom}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundHuman CD133+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) are a
   specific subset of cells that can regulate tumor malignancy. However,
   the mechanism by which CD133+ HPCs affect the malignancy of human breast
   cancer has not been reported.MethodsCD133+ HPCs were isolated and
   purified from human umbilical cord blood (UCB). We used in vitro culture
   of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines, and MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells in
   nude mice to evaluate whether CD133+ HPCs affected the apoptosis,
   proliferation, invasion and epithelial mesenchymal transition EMT of
   breast cancer cells.ResultsCo-culture with CD133+ HPCs, but not UCB
   CD133- cells, promoted the proliferation of human breast cancer MCF-7
   and MDA-MB-231 cells, accompanied by reducing in vitro spontaneous
   apoptosis. Co-administration of these two lines with CD133+ HPCs
   significantly enhanced the growth of implanted breast cancer in vivo.
   Furthermore, co-culture with CD133+ HPCs, enhanced the invasion of
   breast cancer cells, N-cadherin and Vimentin expression, but reduced
   E-cadherin expression in breast cancer cells.ConclusionsOur study
   demonstrated that CD133+ HPCs enhance the malignancy of breast cancer
   cells by attenuating spontaneous apoptosis and promoting the process of
   epithelial mesenchymal transition. These findings may provide new
   insights into the role of human CD133+ HPCs in breast cancer
   pathogenesis. Therefore, CD133+ HPCs may be a new therapeutic target for
   inhibiting the progression of breast cancer.}},

Title = {{Are the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Guidelines Being Correctly
   Used to Diagnose Severe Asthma in the UAE?}},
Journal = {{CUREUS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 25}},
Abstract = {{Objectives
   We aimed to identify the percentage inaccuracy in classifying asthma
   severity as severe asthma based on the 2019 Global Initiative for Asthma
   (GINA) guidelines criteria, at Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, and make
   recommendations to improve the assessment of asthma severity.
   Methods
   All asthma patients that attended the Pulmonology clinic or the Allergy
   clinic from May 2015 to December 2019 were retrospectively analyzed to
   identify which asthma patients classified as having severe asthma
   according to the 2019 GINA guidelines criteria. We then calculated the
   percentage inaccuracy associated with giving diagnoses of severe asthma.
   Results
   We retrospectively analyzed a total of 902 patients, and out of those,
   we identified 334 as patients with severe asthma according to the 2019
   GINA guidelines criteria. Of those 334 patients, 218 were given an
   incorrect asthma severity of either mild (N=14), moderate (N=203), or
   unspecified asthma severity (N=1) in the hospital's electronic records.
   This represents a percentage inaccuracy of 65.3\% in classifying asthma
   severity as severe asthma. Fluticasone propionate-salmeterol was the
   most used ICS-LABA (inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta-agonist)
   medication in the severe asthma group (58.1\%). Fluticasone
   furoate-vilanterol was identified as the most incorrectly prescribed
   ICS-LABA medication (68.2\%).
   Conclusion
   We identified an inaccuracy of 65.3\% in classifying asthma severity as
   severe at our hospital. This inaccuracy is associated with a lack of
   understanding of the GINA guidelines by clinicians, as well as a lack of
   acceptance of some of the criteria in the GINA guidelines by patients.
   We have made recommendations to help improve the accuracy of asthma
   severity assessment, in order to be fully adherent to the GINA
   guidelines criteria.}},

   reliable strategy}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 25}},
Abstract = {{Web search tools are widely used by the general public to obtain
   health-related information, and analysis of search data is often
   suggested for public health monitoring. We analyzed popularity of
   searches related to smell loss and taste loss, recently listed as
   symptoms of COVID-19. Searches on sight loss and hearing loss, which are
   not considered as COVID-19 symptoms, were used as control. Google Trends
   results per region in Italy or state in the US were compared to COVID-19
   incidence in the corresponding geographical areas. The COVID-19
   incidence did not correlate with searches for non-symptoms, but in some
   weeks had high correlation with taste and smell loss searches, which
   also correlated with each other. Correlation of the sensory symptoms
   with new COVID-19 cases for each country as a whole was high at some
   time points, but decreased (Italy) or dramatically fluctuated over time
   (US). Smell loss searches correlated with the incidence of media reports
   in the US. Our results show that popularity of symptom searches is not
   reliable for pandemic monitoring. Awareness of this limitation is
   important during the COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to spread and to
   exhibit new clinical manifestations, and for potential future health
   threats.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose This paper explored the ways through which entrepreneurial
   leadership practices of chief executive officers (CEOs) enhance their
   employees' innovation at workplace in knowledge-based firms. Building on
   social cognitive theory and resource-based view of firms, this paper
   argues that entrepreneurial leadership fosters employees' innovation
   work behavior by enhancing their individual and team creativity
   self-efficacy. Design/methodology/approach The sample was selected from
   knowledge-based firms in Iran using the simple random sampling method.
   Two mediation models were tested using data from 41 CEOs and 207
   employees in two separate phases. Findings The analysis supported that
   CEOs' entrepreneurial leadership improves their employees' innovation
   work behavior through enhancing their individual and team creativity
   self-efficacy. Originality/value The research contributes motivational
   and enabling mechanisms at both individual and team levels that
   entrepreneurial leaders use to improve employees' innovation work
   behavior in the context of knowledge-based firms. The findings may
   assist managers and business leaders in effectively leading innovation

Abstract = {{Peptidoglycan (PG) is an essential constituent of the bacterial cell
   wall. During cell division, the machinery responsible for PG synthesis
   localizes mid-cell, at the septum, under the control of a multiprotein
   complex called the divisome. In Escherichia coli, septal PG synthesis
   and cell constriction rely on the accumulation of FtsN at the division
   site. Interestingly, a short sequence of FtsN (Leu(75)-Gln(93), known as
   (E)FtsN) was shown to be essential and sufficient for its functioning in
   vivo, but what exactly this sequence is doing remained unknown. Here, we
   show that (E)FtsN binds specifically to the major PG synthase PBP1b and
   is sufficient to stimulate its biosynthetic glycosyltransferase (GTase)
   activity. We also report the crystal structure of PBP1b in complex with
   (E)FtsN, which demonstrates that (E)FtsN binds at the junction between
   the GTase and UB2H domains of PBP1b. Interestingly, mutations to two
   residues (R141A/R397A) within the (E)FtsN-binding pocket reduced the
   activation of PBP1b by FtsN but not by the lipoprotein LpoB. This mutant
   was unable to rescue the Delta ponB-ponA(ts) strain, which lacks PBP1b
   and has a thermosensitive PBP1a, at nonpermissive temperature and
   induced a mild cell-chaining phenotype and cell lysis. Altogether, the
   results show that (E)FtsN interacts with PBP1b and that this interaction
   plays a role in the activation of its GTase activity by FtsN, which may
   contribute to the overall septal PG synthesis and regulation during cell
   division.}},

   visible-light-induced photocatalytic activity towards organic dyes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS}},

Abstract = {{The present investigation reports on research of pure molybdenum
   disulfide (MoS2) and MoS2 doped CoO@meso-CN nanohybrids with various
   concentration. The photocatalytic action of MoS(2 )doped CoO@meso-CN
   nanohybrids was established by photodegrading methylene red (MR),
   methylene orange (MO) and congo red (CR) under visible light
   irradiation. The efficient visible light driven photocatalytic action
   was owing to a larger specific surface area of MoS2, which enhanced the
   close interfacial contact between pollutants and photocatalysts. Thus,
   when employed as photocatalyst for organic pollutants photodegradation,
   the developed nanohybrid exhibits a degradation rate of 0.072 min(-1),
   which is high increasing compared with that of pure CoO/meso-CN and MoS2
   (0.014 min(-1) and 0.032 min(-1)). In addition, the nanohybrids
   indicates excellent stability and remarkable organic dyes removal
   capability, which could provide as a potential photocatalyst for water
   remediation under visible light. The resultant MoS 2 doped CoO@meso-CN
   nanohybrids exhibit excellent photocatalytic capacity for MR, MO and CR
   (average removal rate was 94\% at pH values of 3) within 60 min. The
   following demonstrated that synthesized MoS2 doped 1 wt\% CoO@meso-CN
   nanohybrids retained a great photocatalytic as compared to pure MoS2 and
   CoO/meso-CN photocatalysts for degradation of organic dyes. The cases
   were described using XRD, FESEM, FTIR, HRTEM, XPS, TGA, UV-vis, Raman
   and EPR spectroscopy analyses. Our results serve a pathway for the
   fabrication of a MoS2-based heterostructure nanohybrids which can be
   applied for environmental management and reusability regions. (C) 2020

Title = {{Study of the impact of objective structured laboratory examination to
   evaluate students' practical competencies}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION}},
Abstract = {{Measurement of multiple competencies of students is getting more
   emphasis in undergraduate education validating the need for work-ready
   graduates. We developed the objective structured laboratory examination
   (OSLE) to measure the practical competencies of final year biomedical
   science students. This paper analyses the impact of OSLE on students'
   practical competencies and the utility of OSLE. A total of 63 students
   (89\%) from two different cohorts (BM1 and BM2) were recruited to give
   feedback on OSLE using a structured questionnaire under three themes
   viz., prior learning, administration and feedback. Open feedback was
   obtained from both faculty and students. Reliability of different
   components of the questionnaire was established by Cronbach's alpha.
   Correlation between OSLE score and cGPA (cumulative grade point average)
   of each student was calculated using Pearson correlation coefficient.
   Cronbach's alpha value for all the three domains ranged from 0.6 to0.9.
   Students' perception of OSLE was generally positive with a median of 4
   in a to 5-point Likert scale (4 = agree). Feedback from students and
   faculty indicated that OSLE motivated the students to improve their
   practical skills. Interestingly, there was no correlation between OSLE
   score and cGPA of the students reiterating the different competency sets
   used by skill assessment versus knowledge assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Bioresorbable electronic stimulators are of rapidly growing interest as
   unusual therapeutic platforms, i.e., bioelectronic medicines, for
   treating disease states, accelerating wound healing processes and
   eliminating infections. Here, we present advanced materials that support
   operation in these systems over clinically relevant timeframes,
   ultimately bioresorbing harmlessly to benign products without residues,
   to eliminate the need for surgical extraction. Our findings overcome key
   challenges of bioresorbable electronic devices by realizing lifetimes
   that match clinical needs. The devices exploit a bioresorbable dynamic
   covalent polymer that facilitates tight bonding to itself and other
   surfaces, as a soft, elastic substrate and encapsulation coating for
   wireless electronic components. We describe the underlying features and
   chemical design considerations for this polymer, and the
   biocompatibility of its constituent materials. In devices with
   optimized, wireless designs, these polymers enable stable, long-lived
   operation as distal stimulators in a rat model of peripheral nerve
   injuries, thereby demonstrating the potential of programmable long-term
   electrical stimulation for maintaining muscle receptivity and enhancing
   functional recovery. Bioresorbable electronic stimulators can deliver
   electrical stimulation in rodents to enhance functional muscle recovery
   after nerve injury. Here, the authors present a bioresorbable dynamic
   covalent polymer that enables reliable, long-lived operation of soft,
   stretchable devices of this type.}},

Title = {{Gender diversity indices for interpreting the phenomena in expanding
   higher education}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This study aims to explore the higher education expansion
   phenomenon and to what extent that expansion could reshape the pattern
   of gender.
   Design/methodology/approach - We selected Taiwan's higher education as a
   research target. First, we describe the gender diversity patterns in the
   humanity, social science and STEM programs according to Trow's
   definition. Second, we identify discrepancies in gender in the major
   programs according to different indices. Becker's D, Blau index, GPI,
   trend analysis and multiple comparisons were used to transform the
   comparison series data.
   Findings - First, to assess system-wide gender diversity, it was shown
   that in the elite stage, the D is more sensitive than the Blau index in
   plotting trends. Second, neither the D nor the Blau index showed
   sensitivity in humanity and social science programs in the post-mass
   stage. Third, the GPI more accurately detects differences in gender
   patterns in the mass and universal stages.
   Practical implications - This study illuminates gender diversity
   patterns with indices transformation in higher education. Considering
   higher education expansion is a global phenomenon, the fitted indices
   can be used to detect gender diversity issues in wider higher education
   settings.
   Originality/value - This study provides an example for addressing the
   issue using different indices to identify previous and future trends in
   the higher education system. The study suggests alternative
   interpretations for gender diversity in various programs that will
   assist in modifying related gender policies in higher education.}},

   proposed terahertz source are theoretically investigated using a
   split-step time-domain simulation. It is shown that terahertz waves of
   frequencies from 385 GHz to 1725 GHz can be generated by appropriate
   thermal tuning of two DBR LDs. The dual-mode DBR LD terahertz source
   exhibits good spectral quality for residual facet reflectivity below
   0.02, but facet reflectivity of the in-line dual-mode DFB LD terahertz
   source should be below 0.002 to provide similar spectral quality.}},

Abstract = {{Fe-N/C catalyst is the most promising non-noble-metal catalyst to
   replace Pt/C, and has long been a material of interest to researchers.
   It is generally acknowledged that the morphology of carbon support
   exerts a significant effect on the performance of Fe-N/C catalyst. In
   this study, the Fe-N/C catalyst that retains the original
   three-dimensional (3D) structure after calcination was constructed by
   adding graphene oxide (GO) into the precursor solution by electrostatic
   spinning technology. The 3D structure is composed of more than 20 layers
   of interconnected carbon nanofiber networks with carbon nanofiber
   connections between layers. The dual pore distribution is formed after
   calcination, comprising macropores between layers and the rich mesopores
   (3.8 nm) in the nanofibers. Fe-N/C catalysts containing a single active
   substance of FexN-based, Fe3O4-based, and Fe3C-based material were
   prepared by adjusting the heat-treatment conditions. The FexN-based

Title = {{Frequency diffusion of waves by unsteady flows}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{905}},
Month = {{DEC 25}},
Abstract = {{The production of broadband frequency spectra from narrowband wave
   forcing in geophysical flows remains an open problem. Here we consider a
   related theoretical problem that points to the role of time-dependent
   vortical flow in producing this effect. Specifically, we apply
   multi-scale analysis to the transport equation of wave action density in
   a homogeneous stationary random background flow under the
   Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation. We find that, when some time
   dependence in the mean flow is retained, wave action density diffuses
   both along and across surfaces of constant frequency in
   wavenumber-frequency space; this stands in contrast to previous results
   showing that diffusion occurs only along constant-frequency surfaces
   when the mean flow is steady. A self-similar random background velocity
   field is used to show that the magnitude of this frequency diffusion
   depends non-monotonically on the time scale of variation of the velocity
   field. Numerical solutions of the ray-tracing equations for rotating
   shallow water illustrate and confirm our theoretical predictions.
   Notably, the mean intrinsic wave frequency increases in time, which by
   wave action conservation implies a concomitant increase of wave energy
   at the expense of the energy of the background flow.}},

Title = {{Learning-based stacking and caching for improving network lifetime in
   wireless sensor networks}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS}},
Abstract = {{With raising improvements in various sensor applications, wireless
   sensor networks (WSNs) are considered as a significant field for
   research. It is composed on numerous sensor nodes (SNs) to observe sense
   and monitor environment based on application need. Moreover, SNs are
   battery constrained (some may be dead). Henceforth, number of
   energy-efficient protocols are considered and implemented in
   state-of-the-art works. However, choosing an optimal path of SN and base
   station is measured as a crucial crisis. To get rid of this issue,
   learning-based routing is considered to enhance routing mechanism
   stronger. In all iteration, node caching and node stacking is done using
   learning approach to evaluate shortest path between SNs and cluster head
   (CH). Here, network is being trained by considering diverse WSNs
   features and to identify which SNs must be selected for subsequent hops
   to provide shorted path between SNs and CH. The proposed model is termed
   as learning-based stacking and caching (LSC) model. Here, simulation is
   done in NS-2 environment and shows that the proposed technique may
   outperform prevailing protocols like LEACH and A-LEACH. Performance
   metrics like network lifetime, packet delivery ratio, end-to-end (E2E)
   delay, energy consumption, residual energy, error computation, cache hit
   ratio and hop reduction ratio are evaluated. The residual energy of a
   cluster size with 20 nodes is 0.82 J. The network lifetime of LSC is 180
   s with higher PDR. Similarly, the delay is 5 ms for 400 rounds. In LSC,
   CHR is 10, 25, 32, 45, 55, 63 and 65 while HRR is 20, 25, 26, 28, 27, 28
   and 30 respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Noni (Morindacitrifolia L.), a tropical, medicinal plant of the family
   Rubiaceae utilized since 2000 y ago by the Polynesians, is currently
   facing a major challenge in production vis-a-vis climate change. The
   worldwide average temperatures continue to fluctuate, resulting in
   extremely cold winters and hot summers that reduce plant productivity.
   Photosynthetic apparatus is an exceptionally sensitive component to
   estimate the degree of damage at contrasting temperatures. The present
   study was aimed to evaluate the temperature stress response of Noni
   plant using the chlorophyll a fluorescence OJIP transients (OJIP
   transients). Results showed the declined photosynthetic pigment pool and
   reduced functional and structural integrity of the photosynthetic
   apparatus under very low- and high-temperature treatments. Drastically
   lower yield parameters such as phi(Po) and phi(Eo), efficiency psi(Eo)
   and performance indices - PIabs and PItotal, and accumulation of
   inactive reaction centers were observed. Consecutively, a lower level of
   calculated electron transport from PSII to PSI was observed. In
   contrast, the enhanced delta Ro indicates that PSI is more
   thermo-tolerant as compared to PSII. Additionally, very low and high
   temperatures cause an increase in antenna size (ABS/RC) and the decrease
   in the amplitude of I to P phase of fluorescence transient. Overall, the
   photosynthetic apparatus of leaf tissue was more sensitive to low and
   high temperatures than the developing fruit. The findings of the present
   study demonstrated the potential role of thylakoid components of the
   photosynthetic apparatus, which might be crucial in regulating the
   temperature stress response in the Noni plant, and thereby crop
   improvement.}},

   core-shell structure nanocrystals with small particle size can be
   induced via heterogeneous core induction successfully. And the crystal
   phase of core-shell structure nanocrystals can be greatly affected
   through adjusting the amount ratio of core to shell. The mutual
   induction of phase transformation between heterogeneous core and shell
   is investigated. Under the 980 nm laser excitation, the luminescence
   enhancement ability of heterogeneous hetero-phase alpha-NaLuF4:Yb/Er@
   beta-NaYF4:Yb core-shell structure nanocrystals is much higher than that
   of the heterogeneous homo-phase core-shell structure nanocrystals

   efficiency of heterogeneous hetero-phase alpha-NaLuF4:Yb/Er@
   beta-NaYF4:Yb core-shell structure nanocrystals is highest when the Yb3+

   the cross relaxation process when the concentration of Yb3+ ions in

Abstract = {{IQGAP1 is a key scaffold protein that regulates numerous cellular
   processes and signaling pathways. Analogous to many other cellular
   proteins, IQGAP1 undergoes post-translational modifications, including
   phosphorylation. Nevertheless, very little is known about the specific
   sites of phosphorylation or the effects on IQGAP1 function. Here, using
   several approaches, including MS, site-directed mutagenesis,
   siRNA-mediated gene silencing, and chemical inhibitors, we identified
   the specific tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated on IQGAP1 and
   evaluated the effect on function. Tyr-172, Tyr-654, Tyr-855, and
   Tyr-1510 were phosphorylated on IQGAP1 when phosphotyrosine phosphatase
   activity was inhibited in cells. IQGAP1 was phosphorylated exclusively
   on Tyr-1510 under conditions with enhanced MET or c-Src signaling,
   including in human lung cancer cell lines. This phosphorylation was
   significantly reduced by chemical inhibitors of MET or c-Src or by
   siRNA-mediated knockdown of MET. To investigate the biological sequelae
   of phosphorylation, we generated a nonphosphorylatable IQGAP1 construct
   by replacing Tyr-1510 with alanine. The ability of hepatocyte growth
   factor, the ligand for MET, to promote AKT activation and cell migration
   was significantly greater when IQGAP1-null cells were reconstituted with
   IQGAP1 Y1510A than when cells were reconstituted with WT IQGAP1.
   Collectively, our data suggest that phosphorylation of Tyr-1510 of
   IQGAP1 alters cell function. Because increased MET signaling is
   implicated in the development and progression of several types of
   carcinoma, IQGAP1 may be a potential therapeutic target in selected
   malignancies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper uses the paradigmatic pairing of non-binary and lesbian as
   identity labels to investigate changes in conceptualizations of sexual
   specificity as gender becomes divorced from its founding binaries.
   Contrary to the belief that lesbian is threatened by movement away from
   binary gender, this analysis postulates that it is not individual
   identities that are becoming problematic as gender identity becomes less
   binary; rather, it is the fundamental structure of identity which, for
   decades, has sanctioned identities built on exclusions. This cultural
   shift has the potential to liberate structures of desire, giving way to
   a model in which sexuality without gender is more redemptive than
   contentious.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aim Infective issues about anti-tumor necrosis factor
   (TNF)-alpha agents in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remain
   controversial, especially when compared with nonbiological treatments.
   This study aimed to evaluate the incidence and prevalence of several
   infections in anti-TNF-alpha-exposed patients compared with
   nonbiological treatments.
   Methods All naive IBD subjects treated with anti-TNF-alpha and matched
   nonbiologic-exposed patients were included.
   Results Among 3453 patients in the database, 288 anti-TNF-alpha-exposed
   subjects and 288 nonbiologic-exposed IBD controls met inclusion
   criteria. Fifty-eight infections (20.1\%) occurred during anti-TNF-alpha
   treatment versus 23 (8\%) in the matched group (odds ratio {[}OR] 2.9, P
   < 0.001) (incidence 5.72 vs 0.96/100 patient-years, incidence ratio
   {[}IR] 6, P < 0.001). IR was higher for anti-TNF-alpha versus
   mesalamine/sulfasalazine (IR 40.8, P < 0.001), similar to
   azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine/methotrexate (IR 0.78, P = 0.32) and lower
   than corticosteroids (IR 0.05, P < 0.001). The incidence rate of serious
   infections was 1.3 in the anti-TNF-alpha-exposed versus 0.38/100
   patient-years in nonexposed subjects (IR 3.44, P = 0.002), without
   significant difference between anti-TNF-alpha and
   azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine/methotrexate (1.3 vs 3.03/100
   patient-years, IR 0.43, P = 0.1). Predictors of infections in
   anti-TNF-alpha-exposed patients were concomitant use of systemic
   steroids (OR 1.9, P = 0.02) or azathioprine (OR 2.6, P = 0.01) and a
   body mass index < 18.5 at time of infection (OR 2.2, P = 0.01).
   Conclusions The risk of developing infections during anti-TNF-alpha
   therapy remains high, although not dissimilar to that found for other
   immunosuppressants, while concomitant immunosuppression and malnutrition
   appear the most important causes of infection.}},

Abstract = {{In this numerical study, the 2D dynamic behavior of a clayey basin and
   its effect on damage pattern over basin edge are investigated. To attain
   this goal, a fully nonlinear time domain analysis method has been
   applied. Then, the fragility curves of the considered two typical
   industrial structures for that certain point are estimated using the
   acceleration time histories recorded at each surface point. The results
   show that the use of the damage related parameters in site effect
   analyses, instead of amplification curves, can yield more realistic
   estimation of the basin dynamic response. In a distance about 150 m from
   outcrop at the basin edge, the differences between fragility curves
   increase when increasing the distance from outcrop with respect to the
   reference rock site. Outside this region and towards the basin center,
   they tend to occur in rather single curves. Furthermore, to connect the
   structural damage to the basin edge effect, the earthquake demand value
   at different points for two typical structures was evaluated. It was
   seen that the probability of occurrence of damage increases over 250 m
   from outcrop, while the effect of the basin edge was limited to 150 m in
   case of the basin edge evaluation by using fragility curves.}},

Abstract = {{The tenovins are a frequently studied class of compounds capable of
   inhibiting sirtuin activity, which is thought to result in increased
   acetylation and protection of the tumor suppressor p53 from degradation.
   However, as we and other laboratories have shown previously, certain
   tenovins are also capable of inhibiting autophagic flux, demonstrating
   the ability of these compounds to engage with more than one target. In
   this study, we present two additional mechanisms by which tenovins are
   able to activate p53 and kill tumor cells in culture. These mechanisms
   are the inhibition of a key enzyme of the de novo pyrimidine synthesis
   pathway, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), and the blockage of
   uridine transport into cells. These findings hold a 3-fold significance:
   first, we demonstrate that tenovins, and perhaps other compounds that
   activate p53, may activate p53 by more than one mechanism; second, that
   work previously conducted with certain tenovins as SirT1 inhibitors
   should additionally be viewed through the lens of DHODH inhibition as
   this is a major contributor to the mechanism of action of the most
   widely used tenovins; and finally, that small changes in the structure
   of a small molecule can lead to a dramatic change in the target profile
   of the molecule even when the phenotypic readout remains static.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{905}},
Month = {{DEC 25}},
Abstract = {{Near-interface colloidal monolayers are often used as model systems for
   research on hydrodynamics in biophysics systems and in the chemical
   industry. Using microrheological methods, the correlated diffusion of
   particles is experimentally measured in colloidal monolayers near a
   water-air interface. The results show that the scaling lengths
   (chi(parallel to), chi(perpendicular to)) of such colloidal monolayers
   are anisotropic in two orthogonal directions within the monolayer, which
   are parallel and perpendicular to the line connecting the centres of a
   particle pair. The former (chi(parallel to)) is the Saffman length of
   the monolayer, while the latter (chi(perpendicular to)) is a function of
   both the Saffman length and the radius of the colloids. The size of the
   colloids is involved in chi(perpendicular to) but not chi(parallel to),
   which reflects the discrete nature of the monolayer in the transverse
   direction and the continuous nature of the monolayer in the longitudinal
   direction. From the scaling lengths, the viscosities of the colloidal
   monolayers are obtained, which agree with those obtained from the
   single-particle diffusion coefficients. The influence of the boundary
   condition imposed by the nearby interface on the hydrodynamic
   interactions is in a power-law behaviour of the distance z.}},

Abstract = {{A wavelength-independent optical sensor based on an asymmetric
   Mach-Zehnder interferometer (AMZI) is proposed. The optical sensor based
   on an AMZI is very sensitive to wavelength, and wavelength drift will
   lead to measurement error. The optical sensor is compensated to reduce
   its dependence on wavelength. The insensitivity of the optical sensor to
   wavelength mainly depends on the compensation structure, which is
   composed of an AMZI cascaded with another AMZI and can compensate the
   wavelength drift. The influence of wavelength drift on the optical
   sensor can be counteracted by carefully designing the size parameters of
   the compensation structure. When the wavelength changes from 1549.9 nm
   to 1550.1 nm, the error after compensation can be lower than 0.066\%.
   Furthermore, the effect of fabrication tolerance on compensation results
   is analyzed. The proposed compensation method can also be used to
   compensate the drift of other parameters such as temperature, and can be

Abstract = {{The basic physical properties of marine natural gas hydrate deposits are
   important to the understanding of seabed growth conditions, occurrence
   regularity, and occurrence environment of natural gas hydrates. A
   comprehensive analysis of the core samples of drilling pressure-holding
   hydrate deposits at a depth of 1310 m in the Shenhu area of the South
   China Sea was conducted. The experimental results indicate that the
   particle size in the hydrate sediment samples are mainly distributed in
   the range from 7.81 mu m to 21.72 mu m, and the average particle size
   decreases as the depth of the burial increases. The X-ray CT analytical
   images and surface characteristics SEM scan images suggest that the
   sediment is mostly silty clay. There are a large number of bioplastics
   in the sediment, and the crack inside the core may be areas of hydrate
   formation.}},

Abstract = {{The COVID-19 pandemic generated transformations in different areas of

   was to interpret, through content analysis, representations of 1 303
   users of four cross-border media from Baja California, Mexico, and
   California, USA, on Facebook, YouTube and web pages, about COVID-19 and
   the restrictions to cross the border. The closure of the border and
   COVID-19 constitute an emerging social phenomenon and previous research
   studies are scarce, which represented a limitation. In the end, the
   misinformation-fueled representations were found to project fear onto
   others; the comments reflect the majority use of unverified information,
   hatred and attribution of blame for contagion to others. The border was
   represented as an interstice of intersections and economic, cultural,

Month = {{DEC 25}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundWe assessed the quantitative changes in muscle mass and
   strength during 2 weeks of hospitalization in immobile and mobile
   acutely ill hospitalized older adults.MethodsForty-one patients
   (82.46.6years, 73.0\% females) participated in this prospective
   longitudinal observational study. Mobility status was defined according
   to walking ability as described in the Barthel-Index. Functional status,
   including handgrip strength and isometric knee-extension strength, and
   mid-thigh magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of
   cross-sectional area (CSA) were conducted on admission and at
   discharge.ResultsTwenty-two participants (54\%) were immobile and 19
   (46\%) mobile. In all, 54.0 and 12.0\% were at risk of malnutrition and
   malnourished, respectively. The median time between baseline and
   follow-up for MRI scans were 13days in mobile and immobile participants
   (P=0.072). Mid-thigh muscle and subcutaneous fat CSA significantly
   decreased by 3.9cm(2) (5.0\%, P=0.002) and 5.3cm(2) (5.7\%, P=0.036)
   during hospitalization whereas intermuscular fat remained unchanged in
   immobile subjects. No significant changes were observed in mobile
   patients. In a regression analysis, mobility was the major independent
   risk factor for changes in mid-thigh muscle CSA as a percentage of
   initial muscle area (P=0.022) whereas other variables such as age
   (P=0.584), BMI (P=0.879), nutritional status (P=0.835) and inflammation
   (P=0.291) were not associated with muscle mass changes. There was a
   significant decrease in isometric knee extension strength (P=0.002) and
   no change in handgrip strength (P=0.167) in immobile patients whereas
   both parameters increased significantly over time in mobile patients
   (P=0.048 and P=0.012, respectively).Conclusions Two weeks of
   disease-related immobilization result in a significant loss of thigh
   muscle mass and muscle strength in older patients with impaired
   mobility. Concomitantly, there was a significant reduction of
   subcutaneous adipose tissue in immobile older hospitalized patients
   whereas no changes were observed in intermuscular fat among these
   patients. These data highlight the importance of mobility support in
   maintaining muscle mass and function in older hospitalized patients.}},

Abstract = {{In a global pandemic, containment became a major concern after
   confronting such a large scale spread of COVID-19 infection all over the
   world. Many agencies are devoted to analytically understand how
   practicing social distance minimize the impact of major outbreaks of
   infections at large scale. Nearly all strategies are based on isolating
   the entire country or total lockdown in primary phase, while less
   attention has been paid to other alternative interventions during the
   process. This paper discusses the challenges in maintaining an effective
   social alteration method, social distancing followed by self-isolation
   in India. People are facing psychological challenges during the practice
   of Social distancing method. The paper explores how social distancing
   has been used to minimize crowd interactions and prevent the spread of
   disease within groups of people in India. Lastly, the main focus is
   theoretical discussion with conceptual understanding of the protection
   practices in India on a daily basis and challenges faced in social,

Abstract = {{Environmental factors, such as viral infection, are proposed to play a
   role in the initiation of autoimmune diabetes. In response to
   encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infection, resident islet macrophages
   release the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 beta, to levels that are
   sufficient to stimulate inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)
   expression and production of micromolar levels of the free radical
   nitric oxide in neighboring beta-cells. We have recently shown that
   nitric oxide inhibits EMCV replication and EMCV-mediated beta-cell lysis
   and that this protection is associated with an inhibition of
   mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. Here we show that the protective
   actions of nitric oxide against EMCV infection are selective for
   beta-cells and associated with the metabolic coupling of glycolysis and
   mitochondrial oxidation that is necessary for insulin secretion.
   Inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration attenuate EMCV replication in
   beta-cells, and this inhibition is associated with a decrease in ATP
   levels. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), inhibition of
   mitochondrial metabolism does not modify EMCV replication or decrease
   ATP levels. Like most cell types, MEFs have the capacity to uncouple the
   glycolytic utilization of glucose from mitochondrial respiration,
   allowing for the maintenance of ATP levels under conditions of impaired
   mitochondrial respiration. It is only when MEFs are forced to use
   mitochondrial oxidative metabolism for ATP generation that mitochondrial
   inhibitors attenuate viral replication. In a beta-cell selective manner,
   these findings indicate that nitric oxide targets the same metabolic
   pathways necessary for glucose stimulated insulin secretion for
   protection from viral lysis.}},

Title = {{Cultural respect in midwifery service provision for Aboriginal women:
   longitudinal follow-up reveals the enduring legacy of targeted program

Abstract = {{Background Culturally competent maternity care provision to Aboriginal
   and Torres Strait Islander women was identified as a priority area by
   Australia's National Maternity Services Plan in 2011. While midwifery
   programs responded by including core Indigenous content and community
   placements in curricula, little is known about whether knowledge
   learned, and insights gained in response to these initiatives have
   endured and been applied in clinical practice. This follow-up study
   explores the impact of a compulsory Indigenous unit and a remote
   clinical placement on two cohorts of non-Indigenous midwives who were
   participants in an earlier 2012-14 study. Methods Fourteen
   non-Indigenous participants who were either students or recent graduates
   in 2012-14 were located and re-interviewed in 2019-20. In-depth
   interviews based on a semi-structured interview guide were conducted by
   telephone or face-to face; recordings were transcribed and thematically
   analysed using standard qualitative procedures. Results Exposure to
   Indigenous content and settings during training had an enduring impact
   on participants' midwifery practice; most felt better prepared to
   provide culturally safe care, build respectful relationships and
   advocate for improved services for Aboriginal women. Despite this
   positive legacy, they also expressed apprehension about causing offence
   and recognised their own knowledge deficits with regard to Aboriginal
   cultural practices. Organisational constraints, including restrictions
   on the number of family members accompanying a birthing mother were
   identified as barriers to optimal care; some positive organisational
   initiatives were also described. Conclusions This follow-up study
   provides encouraging evidence that well-designed and delivered
   Indigenous content and community placement opportunities in midwifery
   programs can have a lasting impact on service provision to Aboriginal
   women, contribute to a more informed, empathetic and culturally
   competent maternity workforce and help catalyse health service changes
   towards more culturally safe care.}},

Title = {{Optimization of ohmic heating assisted hydrodistillation of cinnamon and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FOOD PROCESS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2021}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In this work, optimum ohmic heating assisted hydrodistillation (OAHD)
   conditions for extraction of cinnamon (CEO) and bay leaf (BEO) essential
   oil were determined by response surface methodology (RSM). OAHD were
   compared with conventional hydrodistillation (HD). Hydrodistillation
   time (30-120 min), mass of sample (20-40 g) and voltage gradient
   (7.5-12.5 V/cm), were varied to maximize essential oil (EO) yield and
   minimize energy consumption. Optimized OAHD conditions were determined
   as 119.90 min, 8.83 V/cm and 40 g, and 120 min, 8.53 V/cm and 40 g for
   CEO and BEO, respectively. EO yields of cinnamon and bay leaves at
   optimum conditions were found 3.98 +/- 0.25\% and 1.36 +/- 0.14\%,
   respectively. Energy consumptions were found 0.42 +/- 0.02 and 0.86 +/-
   0.09 kWh/g EO for CEO and BEO, respectively. EO yield of OAHD was found
   to be higher when compared with HD methods for both plant materials.
   Energy consumptions and emitted CO2 values of OAHD method were
   significantly (p < 0.05) lower than HD methods. Cinnamaldehyde (CEO) and
   eucalyptol (BEO) contents of essential oils extracted with OAHD were
   higher when compared with HD methods. Antioxidant activities of
   essential oils extracted with different methods were not significantly
   different. CEO and BEO formed inhibition zones against all tested
   microorganism strains.
   Practical Applications Essential oils of cinnamon bark and bay leaf are
   commonly used for food and pharmaceutical industries and, have important
   economic value. Conventional hydrodistillation method to extraction
   essential oils is time consuming, requires more energy and has more CO2
   emission rates. Ohmic heating assisted hydrodistillation as a novel
   technology, is a promising method to extraction of essential oils from
   different plant materials with lower process times and energy
   consumption when compared with conventional hydrodistillation. Ohmic
   heating assisted hydrodistillation method can developed with regard to
   scale up as a green technology to essential oil production. This work
   provides a knowledge about the effects of different OAHD process
   variables on essential oil yield and energy consumption for cinnamon
   bark and bay leaf essential oils. It is expected that the outcomes of
   this study will be useful for the designing of large scale ohmic heating

Abstract = {{The QT interval is a recording of cardiac electrical activity. Previous
   genome-wide association studies identified genetic variants that modify
   the QT interval upstream of LITAF (lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor
   necrosis factor-alpha factor), a protein encoding a regulator of
   endosomal trafficking. However, it was not clear how LITAF might impact
   cardiac excitation. We investigated the effect of LITAF on the
   voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.5, which is critical for cardiac
   depolarization. We show that overexpressed LITAF resulted in a
   significant increase in the density of Nav1.5-generated voltage-gated
   sodium current I-Na and Nav1.5 surface protein levels in rabbit
   cardiomyocytes and in HEK cells stably expressing Nav1.5. Proximity
   ligation assays showed co-localization of endogenous LITAF and Nav1.5 in
   cardiomyocytes, whereas co-immunoprecipitations confirmed they are in
   the same complex when overexpressed in HEK cells. In vitro data suggest
   that LITAF interacts with the ubiquitin ligase NEDD4-2, a regulator of
   Nav1.5. LITAF overexpression down-regulated NEDD4-2 in cardiomyocytes
   and HEK cells. In HEK cells, LITAF increased ubiquitination and
   proteasomal degradation of co-expressed NEDD4-2 and significantly
   blunted the negative effect of NEDD4-2 on I-Na. We conclude that LITAF
   controls cardiac excitability by promoting degradation of NEDD4-2, which
   is essential for removal of surface Nav1.5. LITAF-knockout zebrafish
   showed increased variation in and a nonsignificant 15\% prolongation of
   action potential duration. Computer simulations using a
   rabbit-cardiomyocyte model demonstrated that changes in Ca2+ and Na+
   homeostasis are responsible for the surprisingly modest action potential
   duration shortening. These computational data thus corroborate findings
   from several genome-wide association studies that associated LITAF with
   QT interval variation.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundWhile considerable progress has been made in exploring the
   psychological, the neural, and the neurochemical dimensions of OCD
   separately, their interplay is still an open question, especially their
   changes during psychotherapy.MethodsSeventeen patients were assessed at
   these three levels by psychological questionnaires, fMRI, and
   venipuncture before and after inpatient psychotherapy. Seventeen
   controls were scanned at comparable time intervals. First, pre/post
   treatment changes were investigated for all three levels separately:
   symptom severity, whole-brain and regional activity, and the
   concentrations of cortisol, serotonin, dopamine, brain-derived
   neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and immunological parameters (IL-6, IL-10,
   TNF alpha). Second, stepwise linear modeling was used to find relations
   between the variables of the levels.ResultsThe obsessive-compulsive,
   depressive, and overall symptom severity was significantly reduced after
   psychotherapy. At the neural level, the activity in the anterior
   cingulate cortex (ACC), in frontal regions, in the precuneus, and in the
   putamen had significantly decreased. No significant changes were found
   on the neurochemical level. When connecting the levels, a highly
   significant model was found that explains the decrease in neural
   activity of the putamen by increases of the concentrations of cortisol,
   IL-6, and dopamine.ConclusionMultivariate approaches offer insight on
   the influences that the different levels of the psychiatric disorder OCD
   have on each other. More research and adapted models are needed.}},

Month = {{DEC 25}},
Abstract = {{The wxAMPS software is used to simulate the GaN/Si single heterojunction
   solar cells, and the effects of doping concentration, thickness, and
   temperature of each layer on the battery open-circuit voltage (V-oc),
   short-circuit current density (J(sc)), fill factor (F) and conversion
   efficiency are investigated. The simulation results show that as the
   acceptor concentration in the Si layer increases, J(sc) decreases, but
   all of V-oc, F, and conversion efficiency increase. When the doping
   concentration of GaN is 5 X 10(18) cm(-3) and the doping concentration
   of Si is 5 X 10(19) cm(-3), the conversion efficiency of the ultra-thin
   cell with a Si layer of 16 mu m thickness can reach 16.91 \%. As the
   thickness of the Si layer increases, all of V-oc, J(sc), F, and
   conversion efficiency increase. When the thickness of the GaN layer is
   0.005 mu m and the thickness of the Si layer is 100 mu m, the efficiency
   can reach 24.58\%. The simulation results show that when the thickness
   of the GaN/Si single heterojunction solar cell is 60\% of the thickness
   of the current most efficient silicon-based solar cell, the efficiency
   of the former can reach 92\% that of the latter. The research results
   are helpful to fabricate high-efficiency GaN/Si single heterojunction

Title = {{Antimicrobial resistance in hospitalized surgical patients: a silently

Journal = {{ANNALS OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY AND ANTIMICROBIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 25}},
Abstract = {{Background Surgical site infections are related to high morbidity,
   mortality and healthcare costs. Because the emergence of
   multidrug-resistant bacteria in hospitals is becoming a worldwide
   challenge for surgeons who treat healthcare-associated infections, we
   wished to identify the causative agents involved in these infections and
   the rate of multidrug-resistant bacteria in six public hospitals in
   Benin. Methods Using standard microbiological procedures, we processed
   pus specimens collected from obstetrics and gastrointestinal surgery
   wards. Mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) was used for confirmation. For the
   antibiotic susceptibility test, we first used the Kirby-Bauer disk
   diffusion method. The secondary test (by microdilution) used the Beckton
   Dickinson Phoenix automated system (Becton Dickinson Diagnostic, USA).
   Results We included 304 patients, whose median length of stay was 9
   days. A total of 259 wound swabs (85.2\%) had positive aerobic bacterial
   growth. In obstetrics, S. aureus (28.5\%, n = 42) was the most common
   isolate. In contrast, Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) were predominant in
   gastrointestinal surgery, the most dominant being E.coli (38.4\%, n =
   31). Overall, 90.8\% (n = 208) of aerobic bacteria were multidrug
   resistant. Two-thirds of S. aureus (65.3\%, n = 32) were
   methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), three of which
   carried both MRSA and induced clindamycin resistance (ICR). GNB showed
   high resistance to ceftazidime, ceftriaxone and cefepime.
   Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were presented by 69.4\% of E.coli (n
   = 43/62) and 83.3\% of K. pneumoniae (n = 25/30). Overall, twelve
   Gram-negative bacteria (5.24\%) showed resistance to at least one
   carbapenem. No isolates showed a wild-type susceptible phenotype.
   Conclusion This study shows the alarming prevalence of
   multidrug-resistant organisms from surgical site infections in Benin
   hospitals. To reduce the spread of such bacteria in Benin, periodic
   surveillance of surgical site infections and strict adherence to good
   hand-hygiene practice are essential.}},

   high-TB burden countries in the world.
   What is added by this report?
   A dynamic transmission model including both rifampin resistant TB
   (RR-TB) and relapse of pulmonary TB was created. The TB incidence of
   Shanghai in 2025 and 2035 was predicted, and sensitively analysis of
   reducing transmission, treating latent TB infection (LTBI), and reducing
   the recurrence rate was conducted.
   What are the implications for public health practice?

   dose and met the Timmerman 2011 organs at risk (brainstem, optic nerve
   and pituitary) constraints.ResultsCompared with those in the SLPs, the
   maximum dose (D-max) and mean dose (D-mean) of brainstem in the MLP were
   reduced 0.22-3.13\% (2.62\%) and 2.71-12.56\% (5.57\%), respectively,
   all P< 0.05. Meanwhile, the volumes of the whole brain minus the tumors
   that received a single dose equivalent of 8-16Gy (V8Gy-V16Gy) were
   effectively reduced in the MLP. The treatment time parameters, the total
   number of beams and monitor units, of the MLP were reduced by 3.31 and
   1.47\% (P< 0.05), respectively. Although there were a few differences in
   the conformity index (CI) and homogeneity index (HI) between the two
   treatment plans, the differences were not statistically significant
   (P=2.94 and 1.08>0.05).ConclusionOne multiple-lesions plan for brain
   metastases could achieve higher precision in the target and lower doses
   in healthy tissue while shortening the treatment time and improving the
   treatment efficiency over multiple single-lesion plans.}},

Abstract = {{The development of carbon-based catalysts with excellent activity for
   hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is highly desirable but still remains
   a significant challenge. Chemical doping and morphology engineering are
   paramount to enhance their catalytic performance toward HER. Herein, we
   present a novel and effective strategy to synthesize heteroatoms-doped
   three-dimensional (3D) carbon nanotubes/graphene hierarchical
   architecture (N,S-CHTs/N,S-G) on layered double oxide substrates, in
   which the N,S-doped CNTs are in-situ grown on both sides of N,S-doped
   graphene, by two differentiated chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
   processes. The high concentrations of N and S dopants (up to 6.5 at.\%)
   provide sufficient catalytic active sites for HER, while the CNTs
   seamlessly grafted on graphene ensure the excellent electric
   conductivity of N,S-CHTs/N,S-G hybrids. Consequently, the 3D
   N,S-CHTs/N,S-G composites display superior electrocatalytic activity for
   HER with an onset potential of 62 mV vs. RHE (achieve current density of
   1 mA cm(-2)) and a small overpotential of 126 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which
   outperforms most of reported chemical doped carbon-based composites. The
   synthetic strategy facilitates the fabrication of other
   heteroatoms-doped 3D electrochemical catalysts. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Hypericum perforatum is among the most commonly used herbal remedies and
   supplements. The aerial plant parts are often used to treat depression.
   Due to the lack of genomic information of H. perforatum, the gene
   networks regulating secondary metabolite synthesis remain unclear. Here,
   we present a high-quality genome for H. perforatum with a 2.3-Mb
   scaffold N50. The draft assembly covers 91.9\% of the predicted genome
   and represents the fourth sequenced genus in the order Malpighiales.
   Comparing this sequence with model or related species revealed that
   Populus trichocarpa and Hevea brasiliensis could be grouped into one
   branch, while H. perforatum and Linum usitatissimum are grouped in
   another branch. Combined with transcriptome data, 40 key genes related
   to melatonin, hyperforin, and hypericin synthesis were screened and
   analyzed. Five N-acetylserotonin O-methyltransferases (HpASMT1-HpASMT5)
   were cloned and functionally characterized. Purified HpASMT3 protein
   converted N-acetylserotonin into melatonin with a V-max of about 1.35
   pkat/mg protein. HpASMT1 and HpASMT3 overexpression in Arabidopsis
   mutants caused 1.5-2-fold higher melatonin content than in mutant and
   wild-type plants. The endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) in
   transgenic plants was significantly lower than ROS in mutant and
   wild-type plants, suggesting higher drought tolerance. The obtained
   genomic data offer new resources for further study on the evolution of
   Hypericaceae family, but also provide a basis for further study of
   melatonin biosynthetic pathways in other plants.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{905}},
Month = {{DEC 25}},
Abstract = {{Direct numerical simulation of polymer-induced flow relaminarization of
   turbulent spanwise-rotating plane Couette flow (RPCF) is reported for
   the first time. Specifically, the reverse transition pathway from a
   Newtonian turbulent RPCF to a fully relaminarized drag enhanced
   viscoelastic flow has been elucidated. Evidently, this transition occurs
   gradually by weakening and eventual elimination of small-scale vortices
   as the Weissenberg number (Wi) is enhanced, paving the way for a
   two-dimensional laminar flow consisting of large-scale and highly
   organized roll cells. The influence of polymer additives on convective
   momentum exchange by large-scale roll cells and small-scale turbulent
   vortices, namely, the drag reduction (DR) realized by elimination of
   turbulent vortices and the significant drag enhancement (DE) that
   results from polymer roll cell interactions has been identified as the
   mechanism of DE. The observed vortical changes point to a universal
   mechanism for the coupling of polymer chains and turbulent vortices in
   wall-bounded viscoelastic DE and DR flows.}},

Title = {{Effect of Preoperative Infusion of Levosimendan on Biomarkers of

   Randomised Controlled Trial}},
Journal = {{DRUGS IN R\&D}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{21}},

Pages = {{79-89}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Objective The aim was to test the hypothesis that preoperative infusion
   of levosimendan would decrease patients' cardiac biomarker profiles
   during the immediate postoperative stage (troponin I and B-type
   natriuretic peptide levels) more efficiently than placebo after
   cardiopulmonary bypass. Methods In a randomised, placebo-controlled,
   double-blinded study, 30 paediatric patients were scheduled for
   congenital heart disease surgery. 15 patients (50\%) received
   prophylactic levosimendan and 15 patients (50\%) received placebo from
   12 h before cardiopulmonary bypass to 24 h after surgery. Results
   Troponin I levels were higher in the placebo group at 0, 12, and 24 h
   after cardiopulmonary bypass, although the mean differences between the
   study groups and the 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for troponin I
   levels did not present statistically significant differences at any of
   the three time points considered (mean differences {[}95\% CIs] - 3.32
   pg/ml {[}- 19.34 to 12.70], - 2.42 pg/ml {[}- 19.78 to 13.95], and -
   79.94 pg/ml {[}- 266.99 to 16.39] at 0, 12, and 24 h, respectively). A
   similar lack of statistically significant difference was observed for
   B-type natriuretic peptide (mean differences {[}95\% CIs] 36.86 pg/dl
   {[}- 134.16 to 225.64], - 350.79 pg/dl {[}- 1459.67 to 557.45], and -
   310.35 pg/dl {[}- 1505.76 to 509.82]). Lactic acid levels were
   significantly lower with levosimendan; the mean differences between the
   study groups and the 95\% CIs for lactate levels present statistically
   significant differences at 0 h (- 1.52 mmol/l {[}- 3.19 to - 0.25]) and
   12 h (- 1.20 mmol/l {[}- 2.53 to - 0.10]) after cardiopulmonary bypass.
   Oxygen delivery (DO2) was significantly higher at 12 h and 24 h after
   surgery (mean difference {[}95\% CI] 627.70 ml/min/m(2)
   {[}122.34-1162.67] and 832.35 ml/min/m(2) {[}58.15 to 1651.38],
   respectively). Conclusions Levosimendan does not significantly improve
   patients' postoperative troponin I and B-type natriuretic peptide
   profiles during the immediate postoperative stage in comparison with
   placebo, although both were numerically higher with placebo.
   Levosimendan, however, significantly reduced lactic acid levels and
   improved patients' DO2 profiles. These results highlight the importance
   of this new drug and its possible benefit with regard to myocardial
   injury; however, evaluation in larger, adequately powered trials is
   needed to determine the efficacy of levosimendan. Trial registry number:

Abstract = {{Non-healing wounds have placed an enormous stress on both patients and
   healthcare systems worldwide. Severe complications induced by these
   wounds can lead to limb amputation or even death and urgently require
   more effective treatments. Electrospun scaffolds have great potential
   for improving wound healing treatments by providing controlled drug
   delivery. Previously, we developed fibrous scaffolds from complex
   carbohydrate polymers {[}i.e. chitin-lignin (CL) gels]. However, their
   application was limited by solubility and undesirable burst drug
   release. Here, a coaxial electrospinning is applied to encapsulate the
   CL gels with polycaprolactone (PCL). Presence of a PCL shell layer thus
   provides longer shelf-life for the CL gels in a wet environment and
   sustainable drug release. Antibiotics loaded into core-shell fibrous
   platform effectively inhibit both gram-positive and -negative bacteria
   without inducting observable cytotoxicity. Therefore, PCL coated CL
   fibrous gel platforms appear to be good candidates for controlled drug
   release based wound dressing applications.}},

Title = {{Meteorological drivers of respiratory syncytial virus infections in
   Singapore}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 24}},
Abstract = {{Meteorological drivers are known to affect transmissibility of
   respiratory viruses including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), but
   there are few studies quantifying the role of these drivers. We used
   daily RSV hospitalization data to estimate the daily effective
   reproduction number (R-t), a real-time measure of transmissibility, and
   examined its relationship with environmental drivers in Singapore from
   2005 through 2015. We used multivariable regression models to quantify
   the proportion of the variance in R-t explained by each meteorological
   driver. After constructing a basic model for RSV seasonality, we found
   that by adding meteorological variables into this model we were able to
   explain a further 15\% of the variance in RSV transmissibility. Lower
   and higher value of mean temperature, diurnal temperature range (DTR),
   precipitation and relative humidity were associated with increased RSV
   transmissibility, while higher value of maximum wind speed was
   correlated with decreased RSV transmissibility. We found that a number
   of meteorological drivers were associated with RSV transmissibility.
   While indoor conditions may differ from ambient outdoor conditions, our
   findings are indicative of a role of ambient temperature, humidity and
   wind speed in affecting RSV transmission that could be biological or
   could reflect indirect effects via the consequences on time spent
   indoors.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{DEC 24}},
Abstract = {{Acinetobacter baumannii is a prevalent pathogen that can rapidly acquire
   resistance to antibiotics. Indeed, multidrug-resistant A. baumannii is a
   major cause of hospital-acquired infections and has been recognised by
   the World Health Organization as one of the most threatening bacteria to
   our society. Resistance-nodulation-division (RND) type multidrug efflux
   pumps have been demonstrated to convey antibiotic resistance to a wide
   range of pathogens and are the primary resistance mechanism employed by
   A. baumannii. A component of an RND pump in A. baumannii, AdeT1, was
   previously demonstrated to enhance the antimicrobial resistance of
   Escherichia coli. Here, we report the results of experiments which
   demonstrate that wild-type AdeT1 does not confer antimicrobial
   resistance in E. coli, highlighting the importance of verifying protein
   production when determining minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs)
   especially by broth dilution. Nevertheless, using an agar-based MIC
   assay, we found that propionylation of Lys280 on AdeT1 renders E. coli
   cells more resistant to erythromycin.}},

Journal = {{BLOOD PRESSURE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{154-164}},
Month = {{MAY 4}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) over-activity is associated
   with essential hypertension. Renal sympathetic denervation (RDN)
   possibly lowers office- and ambulatory blood pressure (BP) in patients
   with treatment-resistant hypertension (TRH). We aimed to assess the
   effect of RDN compared to drug adjustment on SNS activity among patients
   with TRH by measuring plasma catecholamines and heart rate variability
   (HRV) during stress tests.
   Materials and methods: Patients with TRH were randomised to RDN (n = 9)
   or Drug Adjustment (DA) (n = 10). We measured continuous HRV and
   beat-to-beat-BP using FinaPres (R) and obtained plasma catecholamines
   during standardised orthostatic- and cold-pressor stress tests (CPT)
   before- and six months after randomisation.
   Results: CPT revealed no differences between groups at baseline in peak
   adrenaline concentration (69.3 pg/mL in the DA group vs. 70.0 pg/mL in
   the RDN group, p = 0.38) or adrenaline reactivity (Delta 23.1 pg/mL in
   the DA group vs. Delta 29.3 pg/mL in the RDN group, p = 0.40). After six
   months, adrenaline concentrations were statistically different between
   groups after one minute (66.9 pg/mL in the DA group vs. 55.3 pg/mL in
   the RDN group, p = 0.03), and six minutes (62.4 pg/mL in the DA group
   vs. 50.1 pg/mL in the RDN group, p = 0.03). There was a tendency of
   reduction in adrenaline reactivity after six months in the RDN group
   (Delta 26.3 pg/mL at baseline vs. Delta 12.8 pg/ml after six months, p =
   0.08), while it increased in the DA group (Delta 13.6 pg/mL at baseline
   vs. Delta 19.9 pg/mL after six months, p = 0.53). We also found a
   difference in the Low Frequency band at baseline following the CPT (667
   mu s(2) in the DA group vs. 1628 mu s(2) in the RDN group, p = 0.03)
   with a clear tendency of reduction in the RDN group to 743 mu s(2) after
   six months (p = 0.07), compared to no change in the DA group (1052 mu
   s(2,) p = 0.39).
   Conclusion: Our data suggest that RDN reduces SNS activity after six
   months. This finding warrants investigation in a larger study.}},

Title = {{Hierarchical Bayesian approaches to statistical modelling of
   geotechnical data}},
Journal = {{GEORISK-ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF RISK FOR ENGINEERED SYSTEMS AND
   GEOHAZARDS}},
Abstract = {{Geotechnical data used for reliability-based design (RBD) and load and
   resistance factor design (LRFD) calibration can be parsed into subgroups
   based on material type, location, test method, and so on. Most often
   statistical analyses assume all data fall within a representative
   envelope, and pool (combine) all data into a single large data set
   without rigorously evaluating the veracity of this assumption. Adopting
   a Bayesian view, we introduce hierarchical/multilevel models as the more
   suitable alternative that takes into account multiple variation sources.
   Rather than assuming an identical parameter for data in all groups,
   hierarchical models assume exchangeable group-specific parameters, or
   informally, ``similar but not identical{''} parameters. The utility of
   Bayesian hierarchical modelling is demonstrated by examining the
   accuracy of three reinforcement load models for polyester strap
   mechanically stabilised earth (MSE) walls and a simple hierarchical
   model as an example. We show that hierarchical models (i) have the
   customary complete pooling approach as their limiting case, (ii)
   quantify uncertainty from different sources of variation, (iii) prevent
   under-fitting, and (iv) can be used as tools for understanding the
   variations in the data. A simple RBD/LRFD example shows practical
   implications of hierarchical modelling of bias data. Finally, more
   complex/flexible hierarchical models are briefly discussed.

Abstract = {{Research exploring digital intimate publics tends to consider social
   media platforms and dating/hook-up apps separately, implying distance
   between social and sexual communication practices. This paper troubles
   that delineation by drawing on LGBTQ+ young people's accounts of
   negotiating safety and risk in dating/hook-up apps, in which friendship
   practices are significant. We explore four key themes of friendship that
   arose in our analysis of interviews and workshop discussions: sharing
   mutuals (or friends-in-common) with potential dates/hook-ups; making
   friends through apps; friends supporting app negotiations; and friends'
   involvement in safety strategies. Through analysis of these data, we
   firstly argue that friendship is often both an outcome and an organising
   force of LGBTQ+ young people's uses of dating/hook-up apps, and
   secondly, that media sites commonly defined as social (e.g. Instagram)
   or sexual (e.g. Tinder) are imbricated, with friendship contouring queer

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF RETAIL DISTRIBUTION AND CONSUMER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{358-374}},
Month = {{MAY 27}},
Abstract = {{Retailers may wish to foster high, but not excessively high, consumer
   purchase quantities of a product. Purchase quantity limits can be used
   to try to walk that fine line. Two commonly used approaches that
   retailers use to express purchase quantity limits - offer quantity
   limits and unit quantity limits - are studied in a setting where a
   product is offered for a discounted price. An example of a unit quantity
   limit (UQL) is `Limit 2,' which simply restricts the consumer to a
   maximum purchase of two units of the discounted product. An offer
   quantity limit (OQL) of `Limit 2 Offers,' for example, allows the
   consumer to take advantage of the presented price deal a maximum of two
   times. Since the price information may specify two or more units, the
   maximum number of units consumers are allowed to purchase when an OQL is
   present cannot be determined solely from the number included in the OQL
   verbiage - the price information must also be considered. A pilot
   experimental study and main experiment provide evidence strongly
   suggesting that consumers misunderstand OQLs. The fallacy would harm
   retailers desiring to stimulate high consumer purchase quantities from a
   promotion that includes a restriction. Specifically, consumers intend to
   purchase fewer units when confronted with an OQL rather than an
   equivalent UQL when one of the two restrictions is imposed on a multiple
   unit price promotion. This effect is attenuated when the numeric value
   of the OQL is not a multiple of the units in the price information. The
   present research is the first to examine how consumers react to OQLs
   relative to UQLs.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrogen-incorporated ovoid-shaped nanodiamond (NOND) film exhibits
   excellent electrochemical sensing properties owing to its unique
   characteristics. In this study, to improve the sensitivity of NOND-based
   biosensors for dopamine (DA) detection, a detailed investigation
   concerning the growth mechanism of NOND films was conducted, it is found
   that the NOND films did not directly grow on a Si substrate during the
   growth process but preferentially originated from the formation of a
   thin Si3N4 interlayer attributed to the reactions of Si substrate and
   nitrogen atoms in the plasma in the very early stage of deposition.
   Subsequently, the diffusion of nitrogen from the inner Si3N4 to the
   Si3N4/plasma interface produces more active sites for the adsorption of
   the ionized carbon atoms. As the process proceeded further, the growth
   of ovoid-shaped diamonds accompanies the decrease of the Si3N4
   interlayer thickness owing to the diffusion of nitrogen from Si3N4.
   Significant Si3N4 peaks are observed from both the Raman and X-ray
   diffraction analyses when the sample was subjected to NOND deposition
   for less than 20 min. These peaks then completely disappeared after
   deposition for 60 min, demonstrating the proposed mechanism.
   Furthermore, it is also observed that the deposition of the Si3N4
   interlayer increased the hydrophilicity of the substrate, which is
   ascribed to the lower surface free energy of the NOND. To enhance the
   sensitivity of the NOND, the synthesis of NOND with patterned arrays
   (PNOND) is proposed. The high specific surface area of the highly
   hydrophilic P-NOND obviously enhances the sensitivity of the PNOND-based
   electrodes. Application of the P-NOND electrode for DA detection is
   successfully demonstrated in the mixed DA electrolyte, showing a better
   performance than that of the pristine NOND. This work reveals that the
   P-NOND electrode possesses superior sensitivity and selectivity, which
   is very favorable for DA sensing.}},

Title = {{A Novel Image Encryption Scheme Based on PWLCM and Standard Map}},
Journal = {{COMPLEXITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{DEC 24}},
Abstract = {{In the past decades, considerable attention has been paid to the
   chaos-based image encryption schemes owing to their characteristics such
   as extreme sensitivity to initial conditions and parameters,
   pseudo-randomness, and unpredictability. However, some schemes have been
   proven to be insecure due to using a single chaotic system. To increase
   the security, this work proposes a novel image encryption scheme based
   on the piecewise linear chaotic map (PWLCM) and the standard map. To the
   best of our knowledge, it is the first chaos-based image encryption
   scheme combining the PWLCM with the standard map, which adopts
   permutation-diffusion structure. Unlike the traditional scrambling way,
   a hierarchical diffusion strategy, which not only changes the pixel
   position but also modifies the value, is employed in the permutation
   phase. The operation model of row-by-row and column-by-column is further
   used to enhance the efficiency in the diffusion process. Consequently, a
   good trade-off efficiency and security can be achieved. Furthermore, the
   numerical simulations and performance analyses illustrate that the
   proposed encryption scheme can be used in practical application
   scenarios requiring lightweight security.}},

Abstract = {{Hydroxyapatite (HA) is an inorganic material with high ability to
   interact with proteins and has been recently explored as a support for
   enzyme immobilization. However, there are still some drawbacks
   concerning the recovery of these biocatalysts, which could be overcome
   using magnetic supports. Cobalt ferrite CoFe2O4) is a purely magnetic
   material, which offers excellent chemical stability, ease of synthesis,
   and mechanical hardness, being a promising candidate to form composites
   with HA and produce magnetic HA nanoparticles. Therefore, investigation
   of synthesis procedures and applications of HA/CoFe2O4 composites to
   facilitate enzyme recovery by means of a magnetic field could find
   interest in a broad spectrum of biotechnological processes. Here, the
   co-precipitation method was used to synthesize HA/CoFe2O4 composites
   with different HA/CoFe2O4 mass ratios, for application as supports for
   enzyme immobilization. The enzymes beta-glucosidase, phytase, and
   xylanase were selected for proof of concept due to their wide range of
   industrial applications. The composite with the highest cobalt ferrite
   content (2:1 mass ratio) was highly effective for immobilization of the
   three different enzymes, with immobilization yields (IYs) of 70-100\%
   and recovered activities of 78-100\%. The biocatalysts could be easily
   recovered from the reaction media by both centrifugation and application
   of an external magnetic field, demonstrating their potential for use in
   industrial processes. The materials exhibited good reusability,
   especially in the case of the beta-glucosidase biocatalyst, which could
   be reused 10 times, maintaining around 70\% of its initial activity.}},

Abstract = {{HER2 kinase as a well-established target for breast cancer (BC) therapy
   is associated with aggressive clinical outcomes; thus, herein we present
   structural optimization for HER2-selective targeting. HER2 profiling of
   the developed derivatives demonstrated potent and selective inhibitions
   (ICso: 5.4-12 nM) compared to lapatinib (IC50: 95.5 nM). Favorably, 17d
   exhibited minimum off-target kinase activation. NCI-5-dose screening
   revealed broad-spectrum activities (GI(50): 1.43-2.09 mu M) and 17d had
   a remarkable selectivity toward BC. Our compounds revealed significant
   selective and potent antiproliferative activities (similar to 20-fold)
   against HER2+ (AU565, BT474) compared to HER2(-) cells. At 0.1 IC50,
   15i, 17d, and 25b inhibited pERK1/2 and pAkt by immunoblotting.
   Furthermore, 17d demonstrated potent in vivo tumor regression against
   the BT474 xenograft model. Notably, a metastasis case was observed in
   the vehicle but not in the test mice groups. CD-1 mice metabolic
   stability assay revealed high stability and low intrinsic clearance of
   17d (T-1/2 > 145 min and CLint(mic) < 9.6 mL/min/kg).}},

Title = {{Effect of a Traditional Chinese Medicine Formula (CoTOL) on Serum Uric
   Acid and Intestinal Flora in Obese Hyperuricemic Mice Inoculated with
   Intestinal Bacteria}},

Abstract = {{CoTOL is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula in clinics for
   treating gout and hyperuricemia, especially in obese patients with
   recurrent attacks. However, fewer studies have investigated how CoTOL
   impacts the intestinal flora in reducing uric acid. In the present, we
   analyze the bacteria targeted by ingredients of CoTOL and evaluate the
   effects of CoTOL on uric acid and intestinal flora in a mice model of
   obese hyperuricemia inoculated with xanthine dehydrogenase- (XOD-)
   producing bacteria, Streptococcus faecalis. Firstly, ingredients of
   herbs in CoTOL and gene target by these ingredients were retrieved from
   TCMID 2.0, and these genes were screened by DAVID Bioinformatics
   Resources 6.8, deciphered to retrieve the bacteria. Then, 3-4-week-old
   male C57bl/6j mice were randomly divided into 6 groups and fed with high
   fat diet for 8 weeks up to obesity standard. The mice were inoculated
   intragastrically with 5 x 10(9) CFU Streptococcus faecalis 3 times at
   the 5(th), 6(th), and 7(th) week and intragastrically administrated with
   uricase inhibitor, potassium-oxonate (PO, 250 mg/kg), to induce
   hyperuricemia at the 8(th) week, once a day for 7 consecutive days,
   respectively (IB model). IB model plus CoTOL (0.4 ml/20g) and
   allopurinol (40 mg/kg) were administrated by gavage at the 5(th) week,
   once a day for 4 weeks. The feces and blood in each group were sampled
   at the 4(th) and 8(th) week. With no bacteria inoculation, CoTOL,
   allopurinol, and blank group were treated with CoTOL and allopurinol or
   water, respectively. 44 species of bacteria (i.e., Enterococcus
   faecalis, Streptococcus, etc.) genes were targeted by 6 ingredients of 6
   herbs in CoTOL. Inoculation with Streptococcus faecalis significantly
   caused the elevation of uric acid and the change of intestinal flora
   structure, whereas treatment with CoTOL signi?cantly increased the
   abundance of Akkermansia and those of Bacteroides and Alloprevotella
   decreased. Furthermore, CoTOL exhibited a unique effect on reducing
   weight unobserved in allopurinol intervention. The present study, for
   the first time, demonstrated that CoTOL has beneficial effects on
   hyperuricemia and overweight, which may be attributed to regulating
   material metabolism and improving the structure or function of
   intestinal flora. Thus, CoTOL may be a promising therapy for
   hyperuricemia and overweight in chronic gout management and can be
   integrated with conventional treatments.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction Although automated pupillometry is increasingly used in
   critical care settings, predictive value of automatically assessed
   pupillary parameters during different intracranial pressure (ICP) levels
   and possible clinical implications are unestablished. Methods This
   retrospective cohort study at the neurocritical care unit of the
   University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (2016-2018) included 23 nontraumatic
   supratentorial (intracerebral hemorrhage) ICH patients without signs of
   abnormal pupillary function by manual assessment, i.e., absent light
   reflex. We assessed ICP levels by an external ventricular drain
   simultaneously with parameters of pupillary reactivity {[}i.e., maximum
   and minimum apertures, light reflex latency (Lat), constriction and
   redilation velocities (CV, DV), and percentage change of apertures
   (per-change)] using a portable pupillometer (NeurOptics (R)). Computed
   tomography (CT) scans were analyzed to determine lesion location, size,
   intraventricular hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, midline shift, and
   compression or absence of the basal cisterns. We performed receiver
   operating characteristics analysis to investigate associations of ICP
   levels with pupillary parameters and to determine best cutoff values for
   prediction of ICP elevation. After dichotomization of assessments
   according to ICP values (normal: < 20 mmHg, elevated: >= 20 mmHg),
   prognostic performance of the determined cutoff parameters of pupillary
   function versus of CT-imaging findings was analyzed by calculating
   sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values
   (logistic regression, corresponding ORs with 95\% CIs). Results In 23
   patients (11 women, median age 59.0 (51.0-69.0) years), 1,934
   assessments were available for analysis. A total of 74 ICP elevations >=
   20 mmHg occurred in seven patients. Best discriminative thresholds for
   ICP elevation were: CV < 0.8 mm/s (AUC 0.740), per-change < 10\% (AUC
   0.743), DV < 0.2 mm/s (AUC 0.703), and Lat > 0.3 s (AUC 0.616). Positive
   predictive value of all four parameters to indicate ICP elevation ranged
   between 7.2 and 8.3\% only and was similarly low for CT abnormalities
   (9.1\%). We found high negative predictive values of pupillary
   parameters {[}CV: 99.2\% (95\% CI 98.3-99.6), per-change: 98.7\% (95\%
   CI 97.8-99.2), DV: 98.0\% (95\% CI 97.0-98.7), Lat: 97.0\% (95\% CI
   96.0-97.7)], and CT abnormalities {[}99.7\% (95\% CI 99.2-99.9)],
   providing evidence that both techniques adequately identified ICH
   patients without ICP elevation. Conclusions Our data suggest an
   association between noninvasively detected changes in pupillary
   reactivity and ICP levels in sedated ICH patients. Although automated
   pupillometry and neuroimaging seem not sufficient to noninvasively
   indicate ICP elevation, both techniques, however, adequately identified
   ICH patients without ICP elevation. This finding may facilitate routine
   management by saving invasive ICP monitoring or repeated CT controls in
   patients with specific automated pupillometry readings.}},

Journal = {{THEORY OF COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{DEC 24}},
Abstract = {{We study the extent of independence needed to approximate the product of
   bounded random variables in expectation. This natural question has
   applications in pseudorandomness and min-wise independent hashing.
   For random variables with absolute value bounded by 1, we give an error
   bound of the form sigma(Omega(k)) when the input is k-wise independent
   and sigma(2) is the variance of their sum. Previously, known bounds only
   applied in more restricted settings, and were quantitatively weaker.
   Our proof relies on a new analytic inequality for the elementary
   symmetric polynomials S-k(x) for x is an element of R-n. We show that if
   vertical bar S-k(X)vertical bar, vertical bar Sk+1(X)vertical bar are
   small relative to vertical bar Sk-1(X)vertical bar for some k > 0 then
   vertical bar S-l(x)vertical bar is also small for all l > k.
   We use this to give a simpler and more modular analysis of a
   construction of min-wise independent hash functions and pseudorandom
   generators for combinatorial rectangles due to Gopalan et al., which
   also improves the overall seed-length.}},

Title = {{Flaunting dissonance: The queering of narrative and gender boundaries in
   Patrick White's The Aunt's Story}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMMONWEALTH LITERATURE}},
Abstract = {{The Twyborn Affair (1979) is generally regarded as Patrick White's
   covert ``coming out{''} novel, followed by his frank ``confession{''} in
   his autobiography, Flaws in the Glass (1981). However, this article
   explores how even an earlier work such as The Aunt's Story (1977/1948),
   from the Nobel laureate's modernist phase, may be seen as a pre-text for
   the gay self, whereby the author stages incomplete representations of
   his own subaltern position in the characters he ``becomes{''} in his
   writing. Through a series of textual feints, his persona is disseminated
   in the form of polyvalent alternative selves which belie any possibility
   for recuperation of a stable, authentic selfhood. White thereby refuses
   the univocal inscription of subjectivity upon which sexual hegemony is
   predicated. What I aim to do in this article is to extend the
   particularities of the novel's writing strategies (found in the Jardin
   Exotique section, for example, which functions as a Foucauldian
   heterotopic space) into the province of gender. In doing so, I will show
   how the gay author, through the central character, Theodora Goodman's
   protean identities and the deployment of competing narrative
   epistemologies, can fabricate alternative subject positions. These
   attest not only to the artificial technologies of gender constitution,
   but also function as remnants of White's own divided status, brought
   about by his dissonant subaltern position in the borderlands of
   representation.}},

   ammonia (NH3) at room temperature and showed a strong gas response of
   36.6\% against 100 ppm of NH3 with the response and recovery time of 116
   and 40 s, respectively. In addition, the composite sensor exhibited
   enhanced sensing performance compared to both pure PEDOT:PSS- and
   Ti3C2Tx MXene-based sensors, demonstrating a synergistic effect between
   PEDOT:PSS polymers and Ti3C2Tx MXene 2D materials. These data suggested
   the great potential of using PEDOT:PSS/MXene composite sensors for room

   tracking (MPPT) to micro-grid based on hybrid renewable energy sources
   (HRESs) like wind, solar, battery using an inherent control scheme. The
   proposed control scheme is the chaotic-based big bang-big crunch
   algorithm (CBCA). Here, chaotic-based techniques have been integrated
   into BB-BC to get the global optimum solution. In the proposed control
   scheme, the CBCA streamlines the parameter of the sources converter
   according to the required load demand and creates the optimal switching
   pulses. By the proposed control scheme the sources are controlled and
   operate in the MPPT during low energy generation or off-MPPT modes
   during the excess of energy to meet the load requirement based on the
   system power balance and energy constraints. The proposed control scheme
   is designed to operate the micro-grid as an autonomous system
   considering the power obtainable from renewable sources, the load power
   requirement including the condition of the battery. Finally, the voltage
   on the load side is controlled to assure proficient power transfer from
   the source of energy to the load. With this proper control, the proposed
   technique presents a steady control function at every micro-grid
   subsystems subject to different power generation including load
   conditions. By then, the performance of the CBCA scheme is implemented
   in the MATLAB/Simulink work site and also the implementation is likened
   to the existing approaches like GOA and AGONN. The statistical analysis
   of CBCA with existing approaches under cases 1, 2, and 3 has been
   analyzed. The CBCA method under cases 1, 2, and 3 of mean, median, the
   standard deviation is more efficient than the existing solution
   strategies. The mean value of the CBCA method under case 1 indicates
   1.2641. The median value of the CBCA method under case 2 implicates
   1.2204. The standard deviation value of the CBCA method under case 3
   denotes 0.0762.}},

Abstract = {{Play behaviour and tool using in birds, two well-delineated and amply
   researched behaviours, have generally been associated with cognitive
   abilities. In this study, these behaviours were related to relative
   brain mass in a sample of Australian native birds. Despite suggestive
   research results so far between cognition and tool using, this study
   found no significant difference in relative brain mass or in lifespan
   between tool-using birds and non-tool users. By contrast, in play
   behaviour, subdivided into social players and non-social players, the
   results showed statistically very clear differences in relative brain
   mass between social, non-social and non-players. Social play was
   associated with both the largest brain mass to body mass ratios and with
   the longest lifespans. The results show that play behaviour is a crucial
   variable associated with brain enlargement, not tool using. Since many
   of the tool using species tested so far also play, this study suggests
   that false conclusions can be drawn about the connection between tool
   using and cognitive ability when the silent variable (play behaviour) is
   not taken into account.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM) is a low-grade B cell lymphoma
   characterized by overproduction of monoclonal IgM. To date, there are no
   therapies that provide a cure for WM patients, and therefore, it is
   important to explore new therapies. Little is known about the efficiency
   of epigenetic targeting in WM. Materials \& methods: WM cells were
   treated with BET inhibitors (JQ-1 and I-BET-762) and venetoclax,
   panobinostat or ibrutinib. Results: BET inhibition reduces growth of WM
   cells, with little effect on survival. This finding was enhanced by
   combination therapy, with panobinostat (LBH589) showing the highest
   synergy. Conclusion: Our studies identify BET inhibitors as effective
   therapy for WM, and these inhibitors can be enhanced in combination with
   BCL2 or histone deacetylase inhibition.}},

Title = {{Just what is critical race theory, and what is it doing in British

Abstract = {{Critical race theory is growing in popularity in Britain. However,
   critics and advocates of critical race theory (CRT) in Britain have
   neglected the racialized social system approach. Through ignoring this
   approach, critics have thus ``missed the target{''} in their rebuttals
   of CRT, while advocates of CRT have downplayed the strength of critical
   race analysis. By contrast, in this paper, I argue that that through the
   racialized social system approach, critical race theory has the
   conceptual flexibility to study British society. As a practical social
   theory, critical race theory provides us with the tools to study the
   realities and reproduction of racial inequality. To demonstrate this
   strength of CRT, and to demonstrate its theoretical nature, I discuss
   the conceptual framework of the racialized social system approach,
   paying specific attention to the notions of social space, the racial
   structure and racial interests; the racialized interaction order,
   racialized emotions, and structure and agency; and racial ideology,
   racial grammar, and racialized cognition.}},

Title = {{Vascular endothelial growth factor promotes atrial arrhythmias by
   inducing acute intercalated disk remodeling}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 24}},
Abstract = {{Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia and is associated
   with inflammation. AF patients have elevated levels of inflammatory
   cytokines known to promote vascular leak, such as vascular endothelial
   growth factor A (VEGF). However, the contribution of vascular leak and
   consequent cardiac edema to the genesis of atrial arrhythmias remains
   unknown. Previous work suggests that interstitial edema in the heart can
   acutely promote ventricular arrhythmias by disrupting ventricular
   myocyte intercalated disk (ID) nanodomains rich in cardiac sodium
   channels (Na(V)1.5) and slowing cardiac conduction. Interestingly,
   similar disruption of ID nanodomains has been identified in atrial
   samples from AF patients. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that
   VEGF-induced vascular leak can acutely increase atrial arrhythmia
   susceptibility by disrupting ID nanodomains and slowing atrial
   conduction. Treatment of murine hearts with VEGF (30-60 min, at
   clinically relevant levels) prolonged the electrocardiographic P wave
   and increased susceptibility to burst pacing-induced atrial arrhythmias.
   Optical voltage mapping revealed slower atrial conduction following VEGF
   treatment (10 +/- 0.4 cm/s vs. 21 +/- 1 cm/s at baseline, p<0.05).
   Transmission electron microscopy revealed increased intermembrane
   spacing at ID sites adjacent to gap junctions (GJs; 64<plus/minus>9 nm
   versus 17 +/- 1 nm in controls, p<0.05), as well as sites next to
   mechanical junctions (MJs; 63<plus/minus>4 nm versus 27 +/- 2 nm in
   controls, p<0.05) in VEGF-treated hearts relative to controls.
   Importantly, super-resolution microscopy and quantitative image analysis
   revealed reorganization of Na(V)1.5 away from dense clusters localized
   near GJs and MJs to a more diffuse distribution throughout the ID. Taken
   together, these data suggest that VEGF can acutely predispose otherwise
   normal hearts to atrial arrhythmias by dynamically disrupting
   Na(V)1.5-rich ID nanodomains and slowing atrial conduction. These data
   highlight inflammation-induced vascular leak as a potential factor in
   the development and progression of AF.}},

Abstract = {{We report a detailed experimental investigation of the influence of the
   formation of nanocrystallites on the vibrational, electronic, and
   optical properties of CrSi2 thin films. Both amorphous and
   nanostructured thin films were investigated by means of electrical
   resistivity, Hall effect measurements, and Raman and infrared
   spectroscopies. We show that both types of films exhibit a
   semiconducting-like behavior, with the notable difference that the high
   defect concentrations in amorphous films act as hole donors, modifying
   the electronic band structure and optical constants. The effect of the
   film thickness on electrical properties is well captured by the
   Fuchs-Sondheimer model indicating a decrease in the charge carrier mean
   free path, likely due to the formation of amorphous/nanocrystallite
   interfaces that contribute toward strongly scattering the charge
   carriers. Raman spectroscopy performed on nanocrystallized thin films
   reveals the presence of a Raman-active mode at 229 cm(-1) and confirms
   density-functional theory (DFT) calculations predicting a mode at 248
   cm(-1), the observation of which had remained elusive so far in
   polycrystalline CrSi2. Measurements of the refractive index and
   dielectric constants of amorphous thin films show a very high refractive
   index in the mid-IR range. Our results illustrate how the controlled
   growth of nanocrystallites can be used to tailor the electronic,
   vibrational, and optical properties of amorphous thin films.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a seventeen-level diode-assisted hybrid multilevel
   inverter (DAH-MLI) is proposed. The DAH-MLI eliminates any external
   voltage balancing and/or sensing circuit by inherently balancing the
   capacitors using a series-parallel combination of capacitors and DC
   voltage source. The DAH-MLI uses only one DC source and a reduced number
   of active and passive elements to generate a multilevel staircase output
   voltage. The proposed circuit can also be extended to obtain the higher
   number of voltage levels than seventeen by the addition of a single
   module comprising of two diodes, one switch, and one capacitor. The
   proposed DAH-MLI can boost the input voltage and possesses reverse
   current carrying capability. The proposed DAH-MLI is compared with
   several existing topologies on the basis of the number of active and
   passive components, total standing voltage, and peak inverse voltage to
   verify its advantages. A cost function is used in this study to compare
   the proposed DAH-MLI and other existing typologies. Finally, the
   performance of the proposed DAH-MLI is validated through a 570 W
   experimental prototype.}},

Abstract = {{The oxidation stability of borophene is deemed as a prerequisite for its
   broad applications; however, there is a contradiction from experiments
   as to whether boron atoms in borophenes are active or inert to
   oxidation. Our detailed density functional theory calculations performed
   herein indicate that O-2 molecules tend to be chemisorbed on supported
   beta(12)-borophene easily and dissociate into separated atoms by
   overcoming very low barriers, and spin triplet-to-singlet conversion is
   not important in the chemisorption process. It is found that O-2
   molecules prefer to be adsorbed on two hexacoordinated boron atoms and
   then dissociate and diffuse along filled-hexagon ribbons. A comparison
   between our calculated core-level binding energies and the experimental
   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in combination with detailed kinetic
   analyses, indicates that boron atoms in supported borophenes are active
   rather than inert to oxidation. This conclusion is further supported by
   a novel B5O4 sheet model calculation. The results on the oxidation
   stability and mechanism suggest the protection of borophenes from oxygen
   is therefore essential for their broad applications.}},

Title = {{Built to last a day: The function and benefits of spider mound nests}},
Journal = {{ETHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{127}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{238-245}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Nests are crucial to the survival of offspring and reproductive success
   of the animals that build them. These benefits are subject to change
   over time due to fluctuating conditions inside and outside of nests. For
   many species, nests are assumed to benefit offspring until they disperse
   and therefore, nest destruction prior to offspring dispersal results in
   reduced reproductive success for parents. However, the consequences of
   nest destruction to reproductive success, or lack thereof, remain
   largely unstudied across diverse taxa. Here, we experimentally
   investigate the function and benefits of nests of a mound-building
   spider. Mason spiders (Castianeira sp.) are wandering spiders that build
   intricate nests (mounds) on top of their egg sacs. Their offspring
   inhabit egg sacs at nest sites for up to 7 months, including through
   winter. We find that despite requiring hundreds of collecting trips and
   many hours to construct, mason spider nests remain for a small portion
   of time that offspring occupy nest sites. Our study finds that nest
   benefits change over time, likely explaining this dynamic. Nests greatly
   reduce the rate of predation and parasitism of egg sacs by 19.1\% and
   offspring mortality within egg sacs due to abiotic factors by 19.9\%.
   These effects are only present the few days following nest construction.
   Our study illuminates the idea that nest destruction does not always
   result in reduced reproductive success for nest builders. We suggest
   that nest durability, the ability of a nest to withstand environmental
   conditions, may be subject to natural selection and a critical, yet
   understudied, aspect of parental care.}},

Journal = {{AMB EXPRESS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Salmonella spp. is a high-risk bacterial pathogen that is monitored in
   imported animal-derived feedstuffs. Serratia fonticola is the bacterial
   species most frequently confused with Salmonella spp. in traditional
   identification methods based on biochemical characteristics, which are
   time-consuming and labor-intensive, and thus unsuitable for daily
   inspection and quarantine work. In this study, we established a duplex
   real-time qPCR method with invA- and gyrB-specific primers and probes
   corresponding to Salmonella spp. and S. fonticola. The method could
   simultaneously detect both pathogens in imported feedstuffs, with a
   minimum limit of detection for Salmonella spp. and S. fonticola of 197
   copies/mu L and 145 copies/mu L, respectively (correlation coefficient
   R-2 = 0.999 in both cases). The amplification efficiency for Salmonella
   spp. and S. fonticola was 98.346\% and 96.49\%, respectively. Detection
   of fishmeal was consistent with method GB/T 13091-2018, and all seven
   artificially contaminated imported feed samples were positively
   identified. Thus, the developed duplex real-time qPCR assay displays
   high specificity and sensitivity, and can be used for the rapid and
   accurate detection of genomic DNA from Salmonella spp. and S. fonticola
   within hours. This represents a significant improvement in the
   efficiency of detection of both pathogens in imported feedstuffs.}},

Abstract = {{Background Japan is endemic for human T-cell leukemia virus type 1
   (HTLV-1), and the horizontal transmission of HTLV-1 is often reported.
   However, the window period (WP) for serologic or molecular screening is
   unclear.
   Study Design and Methods Results for anti-HTLV-1 screening and
   confirmatory tests obtained from 648 591 repeated blood donors in the
   Kyushu district, one of the most endemic areas of HTLV-1 in the world,
   were evaluated. A lookback study was conducted for seroconverters.
   Results During 2012 to 2019, 436 seroconverters (155 men, 281women) were
   identified with use of a screening chemiluminescence enzyme-immunoassay
   (CLEIA) and multiple confirmatory tests. Because the period between the
   latest seronegative donation and seroconversion was highly variable
   (2.1-276.7 months), 19 cases that seroconverted within 6 months were
   subjected to the analysis. The WP of the particle agglutination assay
   and CLEIA was estimated to be 2.2 +/- 0.6 and 2.6 +/- 1.7 months,
   respectively. The WP of the indirect immunofluorescence assay was 4.8
   +/- 6.5 months. Although the WP of western blotting was estimated to be
   6.3 +/- 8.7 months, four cases were still indeterminate through the
   study period. Chemiluminescence and line immunoassays, the current
   screening and confirmatory tests used in the Japanese blood program,
   showed the shortest WP of 2.2 +/- 0.6 months. The WP of real-time
   polymerase chain reaction for HTLV-1 was estimated to be 4.1 +/- 7.8
   months.
   Conclusions The WP in commercially available testing systems for
   HTLV-1/2 was determined for natural infection among repeated blood
   donors. Considering the HTLV-1 WP will help increase transfusion safety
   and facilitate the accurate diagnosis of HTLV-1 infection.}},

Abstract = {{Previous laboratory studies of Ebola virus aerosols have used a variety
   of different sampling devices to collect viral material for analysis.
   However, sampling devices vary in their ability to collect aerosol
   particles and preserve the infectivity of collected viruses. If not
   accounted for, this variability has the potential to bias study outcomes
   and confound comparisons between studies in which different samplers are
   used. In the present study, five laboratory-scale aerosol samplers were
   assessed for their ability to collect and preserve the infectivity of
   Ebola virus at low and high relative humidities. Relative humidity did
   not affect physical collection efficiencies, but infectivity was
   preserved better at high relative humidity for most samplers. Overall,
   25-mm gelatin filters were identified as the optimal sampler among those
   tested based on their physical and biological efficiency, ease of use,
   lack of glass components, and ability to be recovered in small volumes
   to produce a more concentrated final sample. Tests demonstrated that
   25-mm gelatin filters recovered in 2.5-mL media and assayed by
   microtitration using an Ebola reporter cell line resulted in an
   approximately 10-fold improvement in sensitivity compared to other
   published methods. The data provided by this study will be useful to
   facilitate comparisons between different studies utilizing aerosolized
   Ebola virus and to inform sampler selection in future studies.}},

Abstract = {{CONSPECTUS: Charged interfaces are ubiquitous in biology, from proteins,
   to membranes enclosing cells and organelles, to bacterial cell walls.
   For nanomaterials to interact with these biological entities effectively
   and selectively, their electrostatic properties must be fine-tuned. To
   date, charged nanomaterials have had their surfaces decorated with a
   single type of charged ligands (positive, negative, or zwitterionic),
   sometimes ``diluted{''} with additional uncharged/hydrophobic ligands.
   Although such materials have shown some promise, they can be
   nonselectively cytotoxic or membrane-permeable, and can nonspecifically
   adsorb serum proteins or display limited cellular uptake.
   In this Account, we review a decade of our work on pH-responsive
   nanoparticles (NPs) covered with mixtures of oppositely charged ligands.
   These so-called mixed-charge nanoparticles (MCNPs) comprise d similar to
   4-12 nm Au cores protected with mixed monolayers comprising positively
   charged N,N,N-trimethyl (11-mercaptoundecyl) ammonium chloride (TMA,
   {[}+]) and negatively charged mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA, {[}-])
   ligands at varying and precisely adjustable proportions. The MCNPs are
   pH-responsive because MUA ligands can be protonated at a lower pH and,
   instead of interacting electrostatically, can engage in hydrogen
   bonding. Importantly, by adjusting the proportion of TMA and MUA
   functional groups on the particles' surfaces, (chi(TMA):chi(MUA))(NP),
   and/or particle sizes, the relative balance between electrostatic,
   hydrogen bonding, and van der Waals forces can be tuned, translating
   into pH-dependent stability versus aggregation of the MCNPs. In this
   way, MCNPs resist aggregation at the pH of healthy tissues and blood,
   but they precipitate or even crystallize at a narrow range of acidic
   pHs, characteristic of extracellular space surrounding tumors as well as
   intracellular endolysosomal compartments.
   We harnessed this propensity of MCNPs to aggregate at the desired pH to
   target low-pH lysosomes in cancer cells. As we showed, MCNPs with
   compositions around (chi(TMA):chi(MUA))(NP) = 80:20 are noncytotoxic to
   normal cells and do not present adverse effects in mice but kill
   multiple different cancer cell types through a pH-dependent assembly of
   micron-sized crystals inside cancer lysosomes. Due to impaired transport
   and clearance mechanisms, this crystallization leads to an increase in
   osmotic pressure and lysosome swelling, which permeabilizes lysosomal
   membranes triggering lysosomal cell death only in cancer cells. The same
   NPs display only limited aggregation in higher-pH autolysosomes of
   noncancerous cells.
   MCNPs can also selectively interact with and disrupt differentially
   charged bacterial cell walls, leading to Gram-selective antibiotic
   activity. The most effective ligand composition against Gram-negative
   bacteria is (chi(TMA):chi(MUA))(NP) = 80:20, while for Gram-positive
   bacteria it is 48:52. Mechanistically, cationic ligands help to attach
   the particles to Gram-negative cell walls, while partly protonated MUA
   ligands compete for hydrogen bonds with cell surface lipopolysaccharides
   and peptidoglycans. As for Gram-positive bacteria, in addition to
   hydrogen bonding, deprotonated MUAs may contribute to the disruption of
   the cell wall by coordinating metal cations.
   Although MCNPs can be nowadays prepared in various and precisely
   controlled compositions, their properties and in vivo fates merit
   further study. In this spirit, we conclude this Account by outlining
   several unresolved problems important for the application of
   mixed-charge nanoconstructs in vivo and in the clinic.}},

Title = {{`So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into
   the past': legacy, care leavers and university study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF YOUTH STUDIES}},
Abstract = {{International research reveals underrepresentation and problems of
   retention, amongst care leavers in higher education, are universal.
   Drawing upon qualitative research in England, we highlight legacy as an
   under-explored and double-edged feature of care leavers' motivations to
   enter and persist in university study. While restricting access to the
   propulsive power of material resources, in the context of a widening
   participation policy mandate, our interviewees' care experiences also
   shaped an `orientation framework' providing a strong desire to `prove
   people wrong' through study. Supporting this orientation were examples
   of significant other relations; but interviewees' linked lives also
   meant the past could resurface in the present, resulting in strong
   emotional reactions. These could threaten orientation to university
   study by undermining self-reliance and fragile mental health. As the
   problem of care leavers' retention occurs across different higher
   education systems with varied structural and cultural specifics, it
   appears to transcend such issues. We conclude further study of the
   nuanced issue of legacy may help better elucidate the problem of
   retention and we advocate for `corporate parenting' moving beyond an
   objective list approach to well-being.}},

Abstract = {{A zinc porphyrin-pendant norbornene polymer with a rigid backbone
   characterized by a 2:1 E/Z isomeric structure ratio has been
   synthesized, and its spectroscopic and photophysical properties are
   examined. Zinc tetraphenylporphyrin, the porphyrin-substituted
   norbornene monomer, and a previously reported zinc porphyrinpendant
   polymer with a flexible polymethylene backbone have been used as
   comparators. Unlike its flexible counterpart, the rigid norbornene
   polymer exhibits clear exciton splitting of its Soret band, much more
   rapid relaxation rates of its excited singlet states, and a very small
   yield of an unusually short-lived triplet state. Unlike the flexible
   pendant polymer, which exhibits excimeric S-2 fluorescence as a result
   of chromophore rotation, anti-Kasha emission from the norbornene polymer
   originates primarily from the unperturbed porphyrin E region. The low
   triplet yield in the polymer is attributed to greatly increased rates of
   competing internal conversion within the singlet manifold. Nevertheless,
   upconverted delayed fluorescence that is quenched by oxygen is observed
   upon intense steady-state Qband excitation of degassed polymer
   solutions, signaling direct triplet involvement. Consistent with the
   polymer's rigid structure, this biexcitonic process is assigned to
   ultrafast singlet exciton migration and triplet-triplet annihilation
   following absorption of a second photon by the small steady-state
   concentration of polymer triplets.}},

Abstract = {{Information hiding is a technique that conceals private information in a
   trustable carrier, making it imperceptible to unauthorised people. This
   technique has been used extensively for secure transmissions of
   multimedia, such as videos, animations, and images. This study proposes
   a novel Tetris-based data hiding scheme to flexibly hide more secret
   messages while ensuring message security. First, an L-Q x L-Q square
   lattice Q is selected to determine the maximum embedding capacity, and
   then it is filled without gaps through rotating and sliding tetrominoes
   while making the shape of each tetromino different. Secondly, according
   to the decided Q, the reference matrix and corresponding look-up table
   are constructed and then used for secret messages embedding and
   extraction. In the authors approach, each pixel pair of the original
   image can be processed to conceal 4- or 6-bit secret messages. The
   experimental results show that their proposed Tetris-based scheme has
   excellent performance, exceeding the performance of some
   state-of-the-art schemes in both embedding capacity and visual quality.
   The proposed scheme also provides secure covert communication.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the apparent simplicity of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)
   and the decades of research into it, controversy remains in the
   literature regarding the identity of the active site and the competition
   between the Heyrovsky and Tafel steps. In this work, we use
   charge-extrapolated ab initio simulations with explicit water in
   conjunction with mean-field microkinetic modeling to explore the
   mechanism for HER on both close-packed (111) and stepped (211)
   transition metals. First, we show that atop H{*}, beyond a monolayer of
   hollow H{*}, is unlikely to play a role in the HER mechanism, given its
   very positive adsorption energies. The energetics suggests the
   Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism to predominate on fcc transition metals under
   typical operating conditions. We evaluate our theoretical results vs
   several experimental observations. We show that the Volmer-Heyrovsky
   mechanism predicts an activity volcano with its peak at a H{*} binding
   Delta G(H){*} approximate to 0 eV, consistent with experiment. In
   contrast, the Volmer-Tafel volcano shows a broad rate plateau between
   Delta G(H){*} approximate to 0 eV and Delta G(H){*} approximate to - 0.4
   eV. We find our theoretical Tafel slopes to be consistent with
   experimental ones on a range of transition metals. We show that, in line
   with experimental observations, the introduction of a CO(g) atmosphere
   shifts the strong binding metals toward the weak binding leg. Our study
   suggests that the simple thermodynamic approach to HER activity still
   holds, even when a detailed kinetic picture is considered.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Providing patient-centered care (PCC) during the last year
   of life (LYOL) can be challenging due to the complexity of the patients'
   medical, social and psychological needs, especially in case of chronic
   illnesses. Assessing PCC can be helpful in identifying areas for
   improvements. Since not all patients can be surveyed, a questionnaire
   for proxy informants was developed in order to retrospectively assess
   patient-centeredness in care during the whole LYOL. This study aimed to
   evaluate the feasibility and validity of an adapted version of the
   German Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PACIC) for surveying
   bereaved persons in order to assess PCC during the decedents' LYOL.
   Methods: The German PACIC short form (11 items) was adapted to a
   nine-item version for surveying bereaved persons on the decedent's LYOL
   (PACIC-S9-Proxy). Items were rated on a five-point Likert scale. The
   PACIC adaptation and validation was part of a cross-sectional survey in
   the region of Cologne. Participants were recruited through
   self-selection and active recruitment by practice partners.
   Sociodemographic characteristics and missing data were analyzed using
   descriptive statistics. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted in
   order to assess the structure of the PACIC-S9-Proxy. Internal
   consistency was estimated using Cronbach's alpha.
   Results: Of the 351 informants who participated in the survey, 230
   (65.52\%) considered their decedent to have suffered from chronic
   illness prior to death. 193 of these informants (83.91\%) completed >= 5
   items of the questionnaire and were included in the analysis. The least
   answered item was item (74.09\%) was item 4 (encouragement to group \&
   classes for coping). The most frequently answered item (96.89\%) was
   item 2 (satisfaction with care organization). Informants rated the
   item{''} Given a copy of their treatment plan{''} highest (mean 3.96),
   whereas ``encouragement to get to a specific group or class to cope with
   the condition{''} (mean 1.74) was rated lowest. Cronbach's alpha was
   0.84. A unidimensional structure of the questionnaire was found
   (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin 0.86, Bartlett's test for sphericity p < 0.001),
   with items' factor loadings ranging from 0.46 to 0.82.
   Conclusions: The nine-item questionnaire can be used as efficient tool
   for assessing PCC during the LYOL retrospectively and by proxies.}},

Abstract = {{Phytophthora blight is one of the most serious diseases affecting melon
   (Cucumis melo) production. Due to the lack of highly resistant
   germplasms, the progress on disease-resistant research is slow. To
   understand the genetics of melon resistance to Phytophthora capsici, an
   F-2 population containing 498 individuals was developed by crossing
   susceptible line E31 to highly resistant line ZQK9. Genetic analysis
   indicated that the resistance in ZQK9 was controlled by a dominant gene,
   tentatively named MePhyto. Through bulked-segregant analysis (BSA-Seq)
   and chromosome walking techniques, the MePhyto gene was mapped to a
   52.44 kb interval on chromosome 12. In this region, there were eight
   genes and their expression patterns were validated by qRT-PCR. Among
   them, one wall-associated receptor kinase (WAK) gene MELO3C002430 was
   significantly induced in ZQK9 after P. capsici inoculation, but not in
   E31. Based on the non-synonymous mutation site in MELO3C002430, a
   cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) marker, CAPS2430, was
   developed and this maker was co-segregated with MePhyto in both F-2
   population and a collection of 36 melon accessions. Thus MELO3C002430
   was considered as the candidate gene and CAPS2430 was a promising marker
   for marker-assisted selection (MAS) in breeding. These results lay a
   foundation for revealing the resistance mechanism of melon to P.
   capsici.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives To compare the accuracy of dynamic navigation (DN) with a
   static surgical guide (SSG) for dental implant placement and the
   influence factors such as the experience of the surgeon and the implant
   sites. Methods and materials A total of 38 implants, which underwent the
   dynamic navigation, and 57 implants which underwent a static surgical
   guide were enrolled in the retrospective study. Coronal deviation,
   apical deviation, and angular deviation were compared between the DN and
   SSG groups, along with the different experience level of surgeons and
   implant sites in the DN group. Results There were no statistically
   significant differences between the DN and SSG groups, and the
   experience level of the surgeons and implant sites in the DN group.
   However, the apical deviation of the DN was slightly higher than the SSG
   group in the anterior teeth (P = 0.028), and the angular deviation of DN
   was smaller than the SSG group in the molar. Conclusion Dynamic
   navigation can achieve accurate implant placement as well as the static
   surgical guide. Additionally, the experience level of the surgeon and
   implant site do not influence the accuracy of dynamic navigation, while
   the accuracy of DN seems higher than the SSG in molar.}},

Title = {{Identifying rare variants for quantitative traits in extreme samples of
   population via Kullback-Leibler distance}},
Journal = {{BMC GENETICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 24}},
Abstract = {{Background The rapid development of sequencing technology and
   simultaneously the availability of large quantities of sequence data has
   facilitated the identification of rare variant associated with
   quantitative traits. However, existing statistical methods depend on
   certain assumptions and thus lacking uniform power. The present study
   focuses on mapping rare variant associated with quantitative traits.
   Results In the present study, we proposed a two-stage strategy to
   identify rare variant of quantitative traits using phenotype extreme
   selection design and Kullback-Leibler distance, where the first stage
   was association analysis and the second stage was fine mapping. We
   presented a statistic and a linkage disequilibrium measure for the first
   stage and the second stage, respectively. Theory analysis and simulation
   study showed that (1) the power of the proposed statistic for
   association analysis increased with the stringency of the sample
   selection and was affected slightly by non-causal variants and opposite
   effect variants, (2) the statistic here achieved higher power than three
   commonly used methods, and (3) the linkage disequilibrium measure for
   fine mapping was independent of the frequencies of non-causal variants
   and simply dependent on the frequencies of causal variants. Conclusions
   We conclude that the two-stage strategy here can be used effectively to
   mapping rare variant associated with quantitative traits.}},

Abstract = {{We use neutron scattering to investigate spin excitations in Sr(

   the two-dimensional (2D) in-plane ferromagnetic (FM) ordered layers for
   0.013 <= x <= 0.25. By comparing the wave vector and energy dependent
   spin excitations in helical ordered Sr(Co0.9Ni0.1)(2)As-2 and
   paramagnetic SrCo2As2, we find that Ni doping, while increasing lattice
   disorder in Sr(Co1-xNix)(2)As-2, enhances quasi-2D FM spin fluctuations.
   However, our band structure calculations within the combined density
   functional theory and dynamic mean field theory (DFT+DMFT) failed to
   generate a correct incommensurate wave vector for the observed helical
   order from nested Fermi surfaces. Since transport measurements reveal
   increased in-plane and c-axis electrical resistivity with increasing Ni
   doping and associated lattice disorder, we conclude that the helical
   magnetic order in Sr(Co1-xNix)(2)As-2 may arise from a quantum
   order-by-disorder mechanism through the itinerant electron mediated
   Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Although perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with organic hole-transporting
   layers (HTLs) have demonstrated the certified power conversion
   efficiency (PCE) over 25\%. Unavoidable performance degradation in the
   atmosphere is still one of the key hurdles facing the practical
   application. In this work, low-temperature solution-processed CuSCN was
   attempted as the inorganic HTL, which has been expected to provide an
   appreciable enhancement in device stability. In addition, concerning the
   potential-induced degradation around the CuSCN/Au interface, a thin PTB7
   layer was inserted as a spacer, yielding a dramatically promoted device
   stability. Furthermore, in order to avoid the destruction to perovskites
   by the solvent of CuSCN, PTAA was attempted as a protection sheath of
   perovskites. Consequently, with optimized dual-interface engineering,
   the best performing cell delivers a PCE of 18.41\% (average 17.63\%) and
   maintains approximately 98.8\% of the initial value more than 1000 h
   without encapsulation, manifesting the superior stability. This approach
   paves a way for achieving PSCs with both high efficiency and long-term
   durability.}},

Abstract = {{RNA viruses rapidly mutate, which can result in increased virulence,
   increased escape from vaccine protection, and false-negative detection
   results. Targeted detection methods have a limited ability to detect
   unknown viruses and often provide insufficient data to detect
   coinfections or identify antigenic variants. Random, deep sequencing is
   a method that can more fully detect and characterize RNA viruses and is
   often coupled with molecular techniques or culture methods for viral
   enrichment. We tested viral culture coupled with third-generation
   sequencing for the ability to detect and characterize RNA viruses.
   Cultures of bovine viral diarrhea virus, canine distemper virus (CDV),
   epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus, infectious bronchitis virus, 2
   influenza A viruses, and porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome
   virus were sequenced on the MinION platform using a random, reverse
   primer in a strand-switching reaction, coupled with PCR-based barcoding.
   Reads were taxonomically classified and used for reference-based
   sequence building using a stock personal computer. This method
   accurately detected and identified complete coding sequence genomes with
   a minimum of 20x coverage depth for all 7 viruses, including a sample
   containing 2 viruses. Each lineage-typing region had at least 26x
   coverage depth for all viruses. Furthermore, analyzing the CDV sample
   through a pipeline devoid of CDV reference sequences modeled the ability
   of this protocol to detect unknown viruses. Our results show the ability
   of this technique to detect and characterize dsRNA, negative- and
   positive-sense ssRNA, and nonsegmented and segmented RNA viruses.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, consumer depth cameras have been widely used in digital
   entertainment and human-machine interaction due to the advantages of
   real-time performance and low cost. Facial depth maps have shown great
   potential in 3D-face-related studies. However, disadvantages of low
   resolution and precision limit its further applications. In this work,
   the authors propose an edge-guided convolutional neural network for
   single facial depth map super-resolution. It consists of two parts: an
   edge prediction sub-network and a depth reconstruction sub-network. The
   edge prediction sub-network generates an edge guidance map to guide the
   depth reconstruction sub-network to recover sharp edges and fine
   structures. Effective data augmentation methods are proposed as well.
   The network is patch-based and able to cope with any size of the input
   depth maps. In addition, it is insensitive to the face pose since the
   synthetic training dataset they generated covers a wide range of face
   poses. The proposed method is validated with three datasets including a
   synthetic facial depth data set, a real Kinect V2 facial depth data set
   and Middlebury Stereo Data set. Experimental results show that it
   outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on all the three data sets.}},

Abstract = {{A LiNbO3-integrated optical waveguide sensor with segmented shielding
   electrode are designed, fabricated and experimentally investigated. The
   segmented shielding electrode is designed to improve the sensor response
   at low frequency and simultaneously to have a larger half-wave electric
   field. The minimum and maximum detectable power-frequency electric
   fields of the sensor with 10 electrode elements in the time domain are
   600 V/m and 139.8 kV/m, respectively, which results in a linear dynamic
   range of 47.3 dB. The minimum detectable electric field of the sensor
   with four electrode elements is 5.7 kV/m, while the maximum electric
   field that can be detected is more than 240 kV/m. By applying the 1.2/50
   mu s lightning electromagnetic pulse, the frequency response of the
   sensor is calculated from DC to 200 kHz with variations of less than +/-
   2 dB. All these results investigate that such sensor has potential

Title = {{Decreased Gamma Auditory Steady-State Response Is Associated With
   Impaired Real-World Functioning in Unmedicated Patients at Clinical High
   Risk for Psychosis}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL EEG AND NEUROSCIENCE}},
Abstract = {{Aim
   Deficits in synchronous, gamma-frequency neural oscillations may
   contribute to schizophrenia patients' real-world functional impairment
   and can be measured electroencephalographically using the auditory
   steady-state response (ASSR). Gamma ASSR deficits have been reported in
   schizophrenia patients and individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for
   developing psychosis. We hypothesized that, in CHR patients, gamma ASSR
   would correlate with real-world functioning, consistent with a role for
   gamma synchrony deficits in functional impairment.
   Methods
   A total of 35 CHR patients rated on Global Functioning: Social and Role
   scales had EEG recorded while listening to 1-ms, 93-dB clicks presented
   at 40 Hz in 500-ms trains, in response to which 40-Hz evoked power and
   intertrial phase-locking factor (PLF) were measured.
   Results
   In CHR patients, lower 40-Hz PLF correlated with lower social
   functioning.
   Conclusions
   Gamma synchrony deficits may be a biomarker of real-world impairment at
   early stages of the schizophrenia disease trajectory.}},

Abstract = {{Trade with marine species as ornamentals is an important sector of the
   international pet trade. The vast majority of these species are
   collected from the wild and one of the top supplying countries is
   Indonesia. Detailed evidence on trade with marine resources in Indonesia
   is lacking or it is hardly accessible. Moreover, the exploitation of
   ornamental species seems to be mostly uncontrolled. This study presents
   detailed characteristics of such trade for Indonesia, including the
   offered species, their sizes, prices, and conservation status, based on
   data and information obtained from wholesalers in 2018. The main
   provinces of marine wildlife collecting are also identified. In total,
   777 marine vertebrate and invertebrate species were traded, belonging to
   174 families including two species classified as endangered: Banggai
   cardinal fish (Pterapogon kauderni) and zebra shark (Stegostoma
   fasciatum). Commonly traded was red lionfish (Pterois volitans), known
   to be a successful invader. The volume of ornamental marine fish
   exported from Indonesia in period 2015-2019 was 3 353 983 kgs sold for
   33 123 218 USD. The province of Bali was identified as the main exporter
   of ornamental marine fish within Indonesia. These findings should help
   to establish sustainable exploitation of marine resources in relation to
   conservation and wildlife management.}},

   Bodies During Spermatogenesis}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{GRTH/DDX25 is a member of the DEAD-box family of RNA helicases that play
   an essential role in spermatogenesis. GRTH knock-in (KI) mice with the
   human mutant GRTH gene (R242H) show loss of the phospho-species from
   cytoplasm with preservation of the non-phospho form in the cytoplasm and
   nucleus. GRTH KI mice are sterile and lack elongated spermatids and
   spermatozoa, with spermatogenic arrest at step 8 of round spermatids
   which contain chromatoid body (CB) markedly reduced in size. We observed
   an absence of phospho-GRTH in CB of GRTH KI mice. RNA-Seq analysis of
   mRNA isolated from CB revealed that 1,421 genes show differential
   abundance, of which 947 genes showed a decrease in abundance and 474
   genes showed an increase in abundance in GRTH KI mice. The transcripts
   related to spermatid development, differentiation, and chromatin
   remodeling (Tnp1/2, Prm1/2/3, Spem1/2, Tssk 2/3/6, Grth, tAce, and Upf2)
   were reduced, and the transcripts encoding for factors involved in RNA
   transport, regulation, and surveillance and transcriptional and
   translational regulation (Eef1a1, Ppp1cc, Pabpc1, Ybx3, Tent5b, H2al1m,
   Dctn2, and Dync1h1) were increased in the CB of KI mice and were further
   validated by qPCR. In the round spermatids of wild-type mice, mRNAs of
   Tnp2, Prm2, and Grth were abundantly co-localized with MVH protein in
   the CB, while in GRTH KI mice these were minimally present. In addition,
   GRTH binding to Tnp1/2, Prm1/2, Grth, and Tssk6 mRNAs was found to be
   markedly decreased in KI. These results demonstrate the importance of
   phospho-GRTH in the maintenance of the structure of CB and its role in
   the storage and stability of germ cell-specific mRNAs during
   spermiogenesis.}},

Title = {{Motivations to Enroll and Engage in Relationship Education Programs: A
   Qualitative Investigation of Key Process Factors}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COUPLE \& RELATIONSHIP THERAPY-INNOVATIONS IN CLINICAL AND
   EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTIONS}},
Abstract = {{Empirical support for relationship education (RE) programs is primarily
   based in quantitative research methods, leaving gaps in understanding
   the experience of couples and individuals who participate in RE
   programs. Further, a more focused understanding on how to attract and
   maintain program participants is necessary, in order to better address
   participant engagement barriers and to ultimately strengthen a program's
   potential impact. This study presents findings from three focus groups
   with participants (N = 20) who enrolled in RE workshops. We conducted
   consensual qualitative research (CQR; Hill et al., Journal of Counseling
   Psychology, 52(2), 196-205, 2005; Hill et al., The Counseling
   Psychologist, 25(4), 517-572, 1997), reaching consensus on six domains
   and 16 categories through the systematic process of examining the
   representativeness across cases. The resulting model offers implications
   for future RE programs to focus their efforts on recruitment and
   retention, ultimately increasing their impact with individuals and
   couples.}},

Abstract = {{The most significant individual safety measures taken during the
   COVID-19 pandemic include physical distancing, quarantine, and
   isolation. Although such steps are taken to control the spread of the
   pandemic, they may also cause various psychological problems. This study
   attempts to identify individual perceptions of staying home due to the
   COVID-19 pandemic through metaphors, and examines the relationship
   between these perceptions and stress, depression, and anxiety. This
   research utilizes a mixed method design called the embedded design. The
   analyses were performed on data collected from 96 women and 80 men aged
   18-57. Qualitative data were analyzed using a content analysis
   technique, while quantitative data were analyzed through the
   Kruskal-Wallis test. The findings showed that most of the participants
   viewed staying home as confinement, experienced boredom/depression
   because of staying home, and felt helpless. On the other hand, some
   participants concentrated on the positive sides of staying home and
   considered it a responsible behavior, an opportunity, and a requirement
   for feeling safe. The individuals who viewed staying home as confinement
   and a cause for boredom/depression experienced more psychological
   problems, whereas those who perceived it as a responsibility or
   opportunity experienced fewer psychological problems. Considering the
   literature on the contribution of positive thinking to the well-being of
   individuals, as well as the lower levels of psychological problems in
   individuals who maintain their positive perspectives despite the
   negativities of staying home due to the pandemic, we recommend that
   mental health professionals focus on the development of positive
   feelings and thoughts in their interventions.}},

Journal = {{LANGUAGE COGNITION AND NEUROSCIENCE}},
Abstract = {{Theories of language and cognition develop iteratively from ideas,
   experiments and models. The abstract nature of ``cognitive processes{''}
   means that computational models play a critical role in this, yet
   bridging the gaps between models, data, and interpretations is
   challenging. While the how and why computations are performed is often
   the primary research focus, the conclusions drawn from models can be
   compromised by the representations chosen for them. To illustrate this
   point, we revisit a set of empirical studies of language acquisition
   that appear to support different models of learning from implicit
   negative evidence. We examine the degree to which these conclusions were
   influenced by the representations chosen and show how a plausible single
   mechanism account of the data can be formulated for representations that
   faithfully capture the task design. The need for input representations
   to be incorporated into model conceptualisations, evaluations, and
   comparisons is discussed.}},

Journal = {{ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the effects of natural processes on coral-algal
   competition is an important step in identifying the role of macroalgae
   in perturbed coral reef ecosystems. However, studies investigating
   coral-algal interactions are often conducted in response to a
   disturbance, and rarely incorporate seasonal variability. Here,
   naturally occurring coral-algal interactions were assessed in situ four
   times a year over 2 years across eight sites spanning diverse benthic
   communities. In over 6500 recorded coral-algal interactions,
   cyanobacteria and turf algae were found to be the most damaging
   regardless of season, resulting in visible damage to coral in greater
   than 95\% of interactions. Macroalgae that primarily compete using
   chemical mechanisms were found to be more damaging than those that
   compete using physical mechanisms (e.g. abrasion), with both groups
   demonstrating decreased competitive ability in summer. While crustose
   coralline algae were the least damaging to competing coral, during
   summer, it became three times more competitive. Our results demonstrate
   that the competitive ability of macroalgae and the outcomes of
   coral-algal competition can fluctuate in seasonal cycles that may be
   related to biomass, production of chemical defences and/or physical
   toughness. The results of this study have important implications for
   understanding the trajectory and resilience of coral reef ecosystems
   into the future.}},

Abstract = {{Using firm-level data for five countries in Latin America we find a
   negative and statistically significant link between social conflict in
   rural areas and ownership of mines. This result suggests that the social
   conflict around mining projects can affect strategic firm behavior
   intended to diversify risk in the face of social, political and
   financial pressures. It constitutes evidence that the costs of social
   conflict can be considered a serious challenge for firms and diverges
   from the literature which has generally viewed these costs as relatively
   unimportant to investment decisions. We apply broad sensitivity tests
   and find that this is robust. Our results also hold to a formal test of

Abstract = {{Background Multiple investigators have described an increased incidence
   of thromboembolic events in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. Data
   concerning hemostatic complications in children hospitalized for
   COVID-19/multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) are
   scant.
   Objectives To share our experience in managing SARS-CoV-2-associated
   pro-coagulant state in hospitalized children.
   Methods D-dimer values were recorded at diagnosis in children
   hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2-related manifestations. In moderately to
   critically ill patients and MIS-C cases, coagulation and inflammatory
   markers were checked at multiple time points and median results were
   compared. Pro-thrombotic risk factors were appraised for each child and
   thromboprophylaxis was started in selected cases.
   Results Thirty-five patients were prospectively enrolled. D-dimer values
   did not discriminate COVID-19 of differing severity, whereas were
   markedly different between the COVID-19 and the MIS-C cohorts. In both
   cohorts, D-dimer and C-reactive protein levels increased upon clinical
   worsening but were not accompanied by decreased fibrinogen or platelet
   values, with all parameters returning to normal upon disease resolution.
   Six patients had multiple thrombotic risk factors and were started on
   pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. No deaths or thrombotic or bleeding
   complications occurred.
   Conclusions COVID-19 pediatric patients show mildly altered coagulation
   and inflammatory parameters; on the other hand, MIS-C cases showed
   laboratory signs of an inflammatory driven pro-coagulant status.
   Universal anticoagulant prophylaxis in hospitalized children with
   SARS-CoV-2-related manifestations is not warranted, but may be offered
   to patients with other pro-thrombotic risk factors in the context of a
   multi-modal therapeutic approach.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying the determinants of human behavior is useful to adjust
   interventions and lead the civil society toward a stronger commitment to
   climate change (CC) mitigation and adaptation objectives, achieving
   greater support for successfully implementing environmental policies.
   Existing research has largely focused on case studies of
   pro-environmental behaviors (PEBs) in developed economies but there is
   very little evidence for developing countries. This study provides
   estimations of the effect of internal factors, such as sociodemographic
   variables, and four psychological dimensions (CC knowledge,
   environmental attitudes, self-efficacy, and trust in sources of
   environmental information) on PEBs. Data were obtained through a survey
   applied with future decision makers - university students - from
   Colombia (n = 4,769) and Nicaragua (n = 2,354). Indices were generated
   for PEBs and the psychological dimensions using z-scores and Principal
   Component Analysis (PCA). Partial correlations were evaluated through
   the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method. Our results suggest that, in
   order to reach the planned emission reduction targets, policy approaches
   should more strongly focus on educating and motivating citizens and
   prepare them for contributing to the environmental cause, as well as
   provide individual solutions to combat CC, rather than providing only
   information on its causes and consequences.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of an agent to detect changes in an environment is key to
   successful adaptation. This ability involves at least two phases:
   learning a model of an environment, and detecting that a change is
   likely to have occurred when this model is no longer accurate. This task
   is particularly challenging in partially observable environments, such
   as those modeled with partially observable Markov decision processes
   (POMDPs). Some predictive learners are able to infer the state from
   observations and thus perform better with partial observability.
   Predictive state representations (PSRs) and neural networks are two such
   tools that can be trained to predict the probabilities of future
   observations. However, most such existing methods focus primarily on
   static problems in which only one environment is learned. In this paper,
   we propose an algorithm that uses statistical tests to estimate the
   probability of different predictive models to fit the current
   environment. We exploit the underlying probability distributions of
   predictive models to provide a fast and explainable method to assess and
   justify the model's beliefs about the current environment. Crucially, by
   doing so, the method can label incoming data as fitting different
   models, and thus can continuously train separate models in different
   environments. This new method is shown to prevent catastrophic
   forgetting when new environments, or tasks, are encountered. The method
   can also be of use when AI-informed decisions require justifications
   because its beliefs are based on statistical evidence from observations.
   We empirically demonstrate the benefit of the novel method with
   simulations in a set of POMDP environments.}},

Abstract = {{Several studies indicate that burrows play an essential role in
   burrowing fish, especially mudskippers, but little is known on burrow
   morphology and utilization of Periophthalmodon septemradiatus. This
   study was therefore conducted at five sampling sites from the estuary to
   upper reaches of Hau River to contribute to the knowledge of the
   behavior of Pn. septemradiatus, via in situ and ex situ observations of
   the utilization of burrow structures. Burrows made by polyester resin
   were used to determine their morphology. The male mudskippers Pn.
   septemradiatus were observed to excavate burrows using their mouths
   during the low tide. The burrows' shapes were found to be J, U and W,
   with 1-3 openings and one bulbous chamber. The chamber was used as egg
   container where the mudskipper deposits their fertilized eggs. W-shaped
   burrows were found to be interconnected chambers where the mudskipper
   used it to change direction of movements inside the burrow. For the J-
   and U-shaped burrows, the commonality at all five sites was identified.
   The W-shaped burrows were common and were only found at two sites (Long
   Duc and An Lac Tay). For the burrows' structure, the openings to the
   surface were oval, circular and bulbous in shape. Yet, there were
   variations between sites, and the burrows' size was similar during the
   dry and wet seasons. At different sites, the depth of the burrows
   seasonally changed. The burrows used by mudskipper provide shelter,
   spawning sites, and access to feeding grounds for other mudskipper
   species.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{A number of proposed and ongoing experiments search for axion dark
   matter with a mass nearing the limit set by small scale structure
   {[}O(10(-2) eV)]. We consider the late universe cosmology of these
   models, showing that requiring the axion to have a matter-power spectrum
   that matches that of cold dark matter constrains the magnitude of the
   axion couplings to the visible sector. Comparing these limits to current
   and future experimental efforts, we find that many searches require
   axions with an abnormally large coupling to Standard Model fields,
   independently of how the axion was populated in the early Universe. We
   survey mechanisms that can alleviate the bounds, namely, the
   introduction of large charges, various forms of kinetic mixing, a
   clockwork structure, and imposing a discrete symmetry. We provide an
   explicit model for each case and explore their phenomenology and
   viability to produce detectable ultralight axion dark matter.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, design scenarios of a tuned mass damper (TMD) for
   seismically excited structures are ranked. Accordingly, 10 design
   scenarios in two cases, namely unconstrained and constrained for the
   maximum TMD, are considered in this study. A free search of the TMD
   parameters is performed using a particle swarm optimization (PSO)
   algorithm for optimum tuning of TMD parameters. Furthermore, nine
   criteria are adopted with respect to functional, operational, and
   economic views. A technique for order performance by similarity to ideal
   solution (TOPSIS) is utilized for ranking the adopted design scenarios
   of TMD. Numerical studies are conducted on a 10-story building equipped
   with TMD. Simulation results indicate that the minimization of the
   maximum story displacement is the optimum design scenario of TMD for the
   seismic-excited structure in the unconstrained case for the maximum TMD
   stroke. Furthermore, H-2 of the displacement vector of the structure
   exhibited optimum ranking among the adopted design scenarios in the
   constrained case for the maximum TMD stroke. The findings of this study
   can be useful and important in the optimum design of TMD parameters with
   respect to functional, operational, and economic perspectives.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Cathepsin S (CTSS), a lysosomal cysteine protease, is overexpressed in
   various cancers, including glioblastoma (GB). A high level of CTSS is
   associated with tumor progression and poor outcome in GB. However, the
   underlying mechanisms of its role in the biological characteristics of
   G5B remain to be elucidated. Here, we uncovered a potential role of CTSS
   in the lysosomes and mitochondria of GB cells (GBCs). Downregulation of
   CTSS in GBCs could increase the expression of autophagy-related
   proteins; however, there was no significant change in p62, suggesting
   autophagy blockade. Moreover, inhibition of CTSS increased the
   expression of mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) and enhanced
   mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake ability, causing mitochondrial Ca2+ overload,
   the generation of copious reactive oxygen species (ROS) and eventual
   mitochondrial apoptosis. Additionally, elevated damage to mitochondria
   exacerbated the burden of autophagy. Finally, we found that silence of
   MCU could alleviate the inhibition of CTSS-induced autophagosome
   accumulation and mitochondrial stress. Collectively, these results
   demonstrate that CTSS plays an important role in the process of
   autophagic flux and mitochondrial functions in GBCs.}},

Abstract = {{Rare earth elements (REEs) and their compounds are essential for rapidly
   developing modern technologies. These materials are especially critical
   in the area of green/sustainable energy; however, only very high-purity
   fractions are appropriate for these applications. Yet, achieving
   efficient REE separation and purification in an economically and
   environmentally effective way remains a challenge. Moreover, current
   extraction technologies often generate large amounts of undesirable
   wastes. In that perspective, the development of selective, reusable, and
   extremely efficient sorbents is needed. Among numerous ligands used in
   the liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) process, the diglycolamide-based
   (DGA) ligands play a leading role. Although these ligands display
   notable extraction performance in the liquid phase, their extractive
   chemistry is not widely studied when such ligands are tethered to a
   solid support. A detailed understanding of the relationship between
   chemical structure and function (i.e., extraction selectivity) at the
   molecular level is still missing although it is a key factor for the
   development of advanced sorbents with tailored selectivity. Herein, a
   series of functionalized mesoporous silica (KIT-6) solid phases were
   investigated as sorbents for the selective extraction of REEs. To better
   understand the extraction behavior of these sorbents, different
   spectroscopic techniques (solid-state NMR, X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy, XPS, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, FT-IR)
   were implemented. The obtained spectroscopic results provide useful
   insights into the chemical environment and reactivity of the chelating
   ligand anchored on the KIT-6 support. Furthermore, it can be suggested
   that depending on the extracted metal and/or structure of the ligand and
   its attachment to KIT-6, different functional groups (i.e., C = O, N -
   H, or silanols) act as the main adsorption centers and preferentially
   capture targeted elements, which in turn may be associated with the
   different selectivity of the synthesized sorbents. Thus, by determining
   how metals interact with different supports, we aim to better understand
   the solid-phase extraction process of hybrid (organo)silica sorbents and
   design better extraction materials.}},

Abstract = {{Background Coeliac disease (CD) is an immune-mediated enteropathy
   against dietary gluten. The treatment for CD is a strict life-long
   gluten-free (GF) diet, which has a profound effect on a person's life.
   In recent years, there has been an increase in the availability of
   gluten-free products. This study investigates how people with CD
   experience and manage a GF diet. Methods Semi-structured, individual
   interviews were conducted in different areas of Norway. The analysis was
   guided by Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Participants with CD
   (n = 12) varied in terms of gender, age, family composition and time
   since diagnosed. Results The analysis revealed challenges for a GF diet
   at the individual, interpersonal, community and policy levels. At the
   individual level, the participants explained that it took time to gain
   knowledge about a GF diet, and they expressed uncertainty about the
   healthiness of a GF diet. At the interpersonal level, the feeling of
   being different and the fear of gluten contamination were barriers to
   the enjoyment of social meals. At the community level, the participants
   asked for a wider selection of tastier GF products to purchase and
   increased knowledge about CD among those who prepare and sell GF foods.
   At the policy level, the participants asked for political action to make
   GF products more affordable. Conclusions This study indicates that
   people with CD should be given information about how to manage a GF diet
   right after being diagnosed with CD. The food industry should be
   encouraged to produce healthy and tasty GF products.}},

Abstract = {{The present study describes the prevalence of bacterial
   cross-contamination in a veterinary ophthalmology setting, a serious
   issue that can result in healthcare-associated (or nosocomial)
   infections among patients and staff. Retrospective (n = 5 patients) and
   prospective (n = 23 patients) studies evaluated bacterial isolates in
   companion animals presenting with ulcerative keratitis, sampling the
   patients' cornea and surrounding examination room, including the
   environment (exam table, countertop, floor) and ophthalmic equipment
   (slit lamp, transilluminator, direct ophthalmoscope, indirect headset,
   tonometer). Results of bacterial culture and antibiotic susceptibility
   testing were recorded, and degree of genetic relatedness was evaluated
   in six pairs of isolates (cornea + environment or equipment) using
   pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Overall contamination rate of
   ophthalmic equipment, environment, and examination rooms (equipment +
   environment) was 42.9\% (15/35 samples), 23.7\% (9/38 samples) and
   32.9\% (24/73 samples), respectively. Methicillin-resistant
   Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP), a multi-drug resistant (MDR)
   pathogen with zoonotic potential, was isolated in 8.2\% (6/73) of
   samples. The patient's cornea was likely the source of
   cross-contamination in 50\% (3/6) of MRSP pairs as evaluated by PFGE;
   notably, two of the three similar bacterial strains did not have an
   exact match of their antibiotic susceptibility profiles, highlighting
   the importance of advanced diagnostics such as PFGE to assess
   cross-contamination in healthcare facilities. Future work could examine
   the contamination prevalence of specific equipment or the efficacy of
   cleaning protocols to mitigate cross-contamination in veterinary
   practice.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives Caregivers of infants with cystic fibrosis (CF) carry a heavy
   treatment burden for their child along with the inherent difficulties of
   raising an infant. This study investigated the impact of self-reported
   caregiver mental health diagnoses and social barriers during the 1st
   year of life on clinical outcomes.
   Methods A retrospective chart review was conducted for infants seen in a
   large tertiary hospital CF clinic over a 5-year period. Baseline
   characteristics were collected, and documentation from physician and
   social work notes were reviewed. Demographics and clinical
   characteristics were compared by the presence or absence of
   self-reported mental health diagnoses, social barriers, and ``emotional
   concern.{''}
   Results Analyses were conducted on 71 patients. Thirty-five percent of
   caregivers disclosed mental health diagnoses, 52\% identified social
   barriers to care, and 55\% reported feeling upset or fatigued. Having a
   caregiver with a self-reported mental health diagnosis was associated
   with tobacco smoke exposure (p < .001) and increased odds of
   hospitalizations (odds ratio {[}OR], 3.01; 95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI], 1.49-6.06), emergency department/urgent care visits (OR, 3.17;
   95\% CI, 1.32-7.64), and longer lengths of stay (OR, 1.93; 95\% CI,
   1.69-2.20). Caregivers who expressed emotional concern had infants with
   significantly lower weight-for-length percentiles (p = .012).
   Discussion Caregiver mental health and social barriers to care are
   important determinants to address as they may impact clinical outcomes
   in infants with CF. Identifying barriers and struggles early increases
   the likelihood that clinical teams can intervene and provide support.
   Further research into mental health and socioeconomic barriers faced by
   caregivers of infants with CF is crucial.}},

Abstract = {{The Japanese apogamous fern Dryopteris yakusilvicola was previously

Abstract = {{Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has been correlated with virus
   infection and immunity status. We retrospectively analyzed the
   association between HBV antibody and DLBCL development in HBsAg(-)
   patients. Compared with HBeAb(-) patients, HBeAb(+) patients displayed
   unique clinical features. HBV antibody-negative patients had better
   therapeutic efficiency (p < .05). The media progression-free survival
   (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of HBV antibody-positive group were
   shorter than the negative group (p < .05). Furthermore, we found
   positive association between CD21 and HBsAb and their synergistic effect
   for prognostic predication. Interestingly, the effect of Rituximab in
   prognostic improvement was more significant in HBV antibody-positive
   group than negative group. Univariate analysis showed that HBV antibody
   was independent risk factor for disease prognosis. Altogether, our
   investigations identified for the first time the close association
   between HBV antibody and clinical prognosis in DLBCL patients. These
   findings provide potential biomarker to predict the effect of Rituximab

Abstract = {{This study investigated changes in learners' motivation, engagement,
   performance, and spatial reasoning over time and across different levels
   of virtual reality (VR) immersion. Undergraduate participants explored a
   virtual solar system via a moderately immersive or highly immersive VR
   platform over three sessions. In a third condition, participants
   initially learned with moderate immersion and transitioned to higher
   immersion after the second session. Following research on novelty
   effects, we explored whether subjective experiences and performance
   would decline over time (e.g., decreasing motivation or performance) as
   participants became familiar with the virtual environment and tools.
   However, we hypothesized that transitional immersion (i.e., switching
   from moderate to higher immersion) might lead to a renewed sense of
   novelty. Results suggested that both moderate and higher levels of
   immersion were motivating, engaging, and supportive of learning. In
   contrast to predictions based on novelty effects, these outcomes did not
   decline overall as learners gained familiarity with the systems.
   However, transitional immersion emerged as a promising and testable
   pedagogical approach for future VR education. All participants also
   showed gains in spatial reasoning.}},

Abstract = {{A combined experimental and quantum-chemical study of the structure and
   optoelectronic properties of isolated non-stoichiometric CdxSey+
   clusters with x=3, 4 and y=3, 4 is presented. The consistency of optical
   response calculations with the measured absorption spectra reveals that
   the theoretically predicted lowest energy structural isomers have been
   formed in the molecular beam experiments. The Se-rich nanocluster
   Cd3Se4+ contains a Se-2(-) unit which is responsible for the enhanced
   light absorption in the visible spectral range. In contrast, the radical
   electron of the Cd-rich species Cd4Se3+ is localized at a Cd+ centre
   which is attached to a six-membered Cd3Se3 ring. The excess Cd atom is
   partly responsible for an intense optical absorption in the near
   ultraviolet. The variation of the geometry and the optical behaviour in
   dependence of the stoichiometry is discussed with respect to the
   photocatalytic properties of CdSe nanoparticles}},

Title = {{Role of Online Retailers' Post-sale Services in Building Relationships
   and Developing Repurchases: A Comparison-Based Analysis Among Male and
   Female Customers}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Customers are skeptical about shopping online because e-commerce
   environments are typically considered impersonal. To assure product
   quality and to enhance customer proclivity in such environments,
   post-sale services (i.e., product returns, exchange, and maintenance)
   may be considered to alleviate customers' skepticism. Therefore, this
   study's objective is to investigate the role of an online retailer's
   post-sale services (i.e., product return, exchange, and maintenance) on
   customers' attitudinal (building relationships) and behavioral aspects
   (developing customers' repurchase intentions). Structural equation
   modeling is applied to data collected through an online survey answered
   by 409 online customers of (after missing data were removed). Research
   findings show that product return, exchange, and maintenance services
   are strongly predictive of online customer satisfaction, and
   satisfaction significantly impacts customer trust. Both customer
   satisfaction and trust, as indicators of relationship quality, further
   mediate the links between product return, exchange, and maintenance
   services and online customer repurchase intention. In addition,
   differences between male and female customers were found in various
   aspects of online retailers' product return, exchange, and maintenance
   services. This is the first empirical study that not only examines the
   influence of all three dimensions of online retailers' post-sale
   services on customers' online shopping perceptions and decisions, but
   also considers differences between male and female customers. Finally,
   this research provides theoretical and managerial implications based on
   conceptual and empirical evidence.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction The prognosis of postinfectious bronchiolitis obliterans
   (PIBO) has many implications, ranging between reduced quality of life
   and life-threatening complications. We evaluated the prognostic factors
   for PIBO using the baseline clinical characteristics of patients and
   built a prediction model for determining the prognoses of PIBO patients
   using the identified parameters.
   Methods We included 47 PIBO patients who underwent spirometry and
   impulse oscillometry and followed them up for at least 1 year. A
   patient's prognosis was classified as poor if the patient experienced at
   least one of the following: persistent respiratory symptoms for more
   than 1 year, two or more instances of hospitalizations due to
   respiratory symptoms, or more than one intensive care unit admission.
   Results The prognoses of 32/47 (68.1\%) patients was good, while that of
   15/47 (31.9\%) was poor. Spirometry results showed significantly lower
   forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the first
   second (FEV1), forced expiratory flow at 25\%-75\% of FVC, and
   post-bronchodilator (BD) FEV1 values in the poor prognosis group; chest
   computed tomography (CT) demonstrated more inflammatory bronchiolitis
   findings. We created a nomogram for predicting prognoses using post-BD
   FEV1 and inflammatory bronchiolitis on chest CT. The area under the
   curve for the nomogram was 84.6\% (95\% confidence interval:
   72.8\%-96.4\%).
   Conclusions PIBO patients with lower pulmonary function values and more
   findings of inflammatory bronchiolitis on initial examination have poor
   prognoses. The nomogram for predicting PIBO prognosis is easy to use and
   can be applied at the time of diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{Immunosuppressants are widely used to treat patients with rheumatoid
   arthritis (RA), and their adverse effects have been known to cause other
   iatrogenic immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorders
   (OIIA-LPDs). We report a patient with RA who had been treated with
   methotrexate (MTX) and tacrolimus (TAC) and who developed whole body
   lymphadenopathy. We simultaneously confirmed angioimmunoblastic T-cell
   lymphoma (AITL) through a right cervical lymph node biopsy and
   Epstein-Barr virus-positive B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder
   (EBV-positive B-LPD) through a bone marrow examination. After cessation
   of immunosuppressant therapy, both LPDs completely disappeared. Patients
   with AITL are occasionally reported to develop B-cell lymphoma through
   reactivation of the EBV, which leads to clonal expansion in the
   microenvironment. Immunohistochemistry results revealed that both LPD
   components were positive for EBV-encoded RNA. Moreover, in this patient,
   the plasma EBV DNA level was found to be high; therefore, EBV infection
   was a probable etiology. Synchronous coexistence of AITL and B-LPD as an
   OIIA-LPD has rarely been reported. This case report is the first to
   discuss the disappearance of both LPDs on withdrawal of
   immunosuppressants only. AITL occasionally accompany B-LPD; however,
   this composite lymphoma comprised AITL and B-LPD, and OIIA-LPDs should
   not be overlooked.}},

Journal = {{INTEGRATIVE ZOOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{The emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR) in Proteus mirabilis
   clinical isolates is a growing public health concern and has serious
   implications for wildlife. What is the role of wildlife has been become
   one of the hot issues in disseminating antimicrobial resistance. Here,
   54 P. mirabilis isolates from 12 different species were identified.
   Among them, 25 isolates were determined to be MDR by profile of
   antimicrobial susceptibility; 10 MDR P. mirabilis isolates were
   subjected to comparative genomic analysis by whole genome sequencing.
   Comprehensive analysis showed that chromosome of P. mirabilis isolates
   mainly carries multidrug-resistance complex elements harboring
   resistance to carbapenem genes bla(OXA-1), bla(NDM-1), and bla(TEM-1).
   Class I integron is the insertion hotspot of IS26; it can be inserted
   into type I integron at different sites, thus forming a variety of
   multiple drug resistance decision sites. At the same time, Tn21, Tn7,
   and SXT/R391 mobile elements cause widespread spread of these drug
   resistance genes. In conclusion, P. mirabilis isolates from wildlife
   showed higher resistance to commonly used clinic drugs comparing to
   those from human. Therefore, wild animals carrying MDR clinical isolates
   should be paid attention to by the public health.}},

Abstract = {{The India Hypertension Control Initiative (IHCI) is a multi-partner
   initiative, implementing and scaling up a public health hypertension
   control program across India. A cohort of 21,895 adult hypertension
   patients in 24 IHCI sentinel site facilities in four Indian states
   (Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Telangana), registered from
   January 2018 until June 2019 were assessed at baseline and then followed
   up for blood pressure (BP) control and antihypertensive medication use.
   Among all registrations, 11 274 (51\%) of the patients returned for a
   follow-up visit between July 2019 and September 2019. Among patients
   returning for follow-up, 26.3\% had BP controlled at registration, and
   59.8\% had BP controlled at follow-up (p < .001). The absolute
   improvement in BP control was more than two times greater in primary
   care (48.1 percentage point increase) than secondary care facilities
   (22.9 percentage point increase). Most IHCI patients received
   prescriptions according to state-specific treatment protocols. This
   study demonstrates that a scalable public health hypertension control
   program can yield substantial BP control improvements, especially in
   primary care settings. However, high loss to follow-up limits population
   health impact; future efforts should focus on improving systems to
   increase the likelihood that patients will return to the clinic for
   routine hypertension care.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundAmoebozoa is a eukaryotic supergroup composed of unicellular
   and multicellular amoebic protozoa (e.g. Acanthamoeba, Dictyostelium,
   and Entamoeba). They are model organisms for studies in cellular and
   evolutionary biology and are of medical and veterinary importance.
   Despite their importance, Amoebozoan genome organization and genetic
   diversity remain poorly studied due to a lack of high-quality reference
   genomes. The slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum is the only Amoebozoan
   species whose genome is available at the chromosome-level.ResultsHere,
   we provide a near-chromosome-level assembly of the Entamoeba histolytica
   genome, the second semi-completed Amoebozoan genome. The availability of
   this improved genome allowed us to discover inter-strain heterogeneity
   in ploidy at the near-chromosome or sub-chromosome level among 11
   clinical isolates and the reference strain. Furthermore, we observed
   ploidy-independent regulation of gene expression, contrary to what is
   observed in other organisms, where RNA levels are affected by
   ploidy.ConclusionsOur findings offer new insights into Entamoeba
   chromosome organization, ploidy, transcriptional regulation, and
   inter-strain variation, which will help to further decipher observed
   spectrums of virulence, disease symptoms, and drug sensitivity of E.

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of the current study was to examine relations between
   sleep problems and family factors and early markers of ADHD in young
   children with and without a familial risk for ADHD.
   Methods: Differences in sleep behavior and family functioning in
   children under 6 years with (n = 72) and without (n = 139) a familial
   risk for ADHD were investigated. The influence of family and sleep
   factors on the development of early temperament markers of ADHD
   (effortful control and negative affect) was explored. Parents/caregivers
   completed questionnaires on family functioning, child sleep behavior,
   and general regulatory behaviors.
   Results: A significant difference was observed between high-risk and
   low-risk groups for family functioning in the infant/toddler (<3 years)
   and preschool (>3 years) cohorts. Parents of infants/toddlers in the
   high-risk group reported poorer infant sleep. However, there were no
   sleep differences reported for the preschool cohort. Family functioning
   was found to predict effortful control, while sleep quality predicted
   negative affect.
   Conclusion: The results of this study highlight potential family and
   sleep issues for young children with a familial history of ADHD and the
   potential influence of these factors on early temperament markers of
   ADHD. Future research should explore these relations further in order to
   better establish whether early sleep and family interventions could
   mitigate later ADHD symptomatology.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives To evaluate the clinical performance of resin composite
   restorations and to investigate causes of failure.
   Materials and Methods The longevity of 216 restorations in 53 patients
   (mean age, 33.3 years) was retrospectively evaluated according to
   Federation Dentaire Internationale (FDI) criteria. Dental history and
   photographic data were used to evaluate diastema closure (n = 199) and
   recontouring (n = 19) restorations comprising microhybrid (Essentia
   Universal, GC Corp.), nanohybrid (Ceram.x One, Dentsply Sirona), and
   nanofilled (Estelite Asteria, Tokuyama Dental) composites. Data were
   analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier log-rank test, Cox regression analysis,
   Pearson chi-square test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically
   significant. The overall survival rate was 90.3 \% and the mean survival
   duration was 46.2 months during the for 4 - year study period. The
   annual failure rate was 0.9 \% - 3.4 \%. Mean survival durations for
   diastema closure and recontouring restorations were 46.2 and 45.9
   months, respectively (p = 0.328). Mean survival durations for Essentia
   Universal, Estelite Asteria, and Ceram.x One were 46.1, 46.7, and 45.7
   months, respectively (p = 0.677). If we include failed restorations that
   were repaired and remained functional, the overall survival rate was 100
   \%.
   Conclusion Longevity was similar among composites and restoration types.
   The long-term clinical performance of monochromatic anterior composite
   restorations was robust. Composite repair may be suitable for diastema
   closure and recontouring restorations.
   Clinical Significance There is a lack of long-term clinical evidence
   regarding the performance of direct anterior composite restorations.
   Monochromatic direct composite restorations may meet both the esthetic
   and functional expectations with even simpler restorative techniques.
   This 4 - year follow-up study evaluated the clinical performance of
   monochromatic anterior diastema closure and recontouring restorations
   with three different composite materials. The longevity of the
   restorations and the reasons for failure were investigated.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundSpine metastasis is a common occurrence in cancer patients and
   results in pain, neurologic deficits, decline in performance status,
   disability, inferior quality of life (QOL), and reduction in ability to
   receive cancer-directed therapies. Conventional external beam radiation
   therapy (EBRT) is associated with modest rates of pain relief, high
   rates of disease recurrence, low response rates for those with
   radioresistant histologies, and limited improvement in neurologic
   deficits. The addition of radiofrequency ablation/percutaneous vertebral
   augmentation (RFA/PVA) to index sites together with EBRT may improve
   pain response rates and corresponding quality of life.Methods/designThis
   is a single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled trial in
   patients with spine metastasis from T5-L5, stratified according to tumor
   type (radioresistant vs. radiosensitive) in which patients in each
   stratum will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either RFA/PVA and EBRT or
   EBRT alone. All patients will be treated with EBRT to a dose of 20-30Gy
   in 5-10 fractions. The target parameters will be measured and recorded
   at the baseline clinic visit, and daily at home with collection of
   weekly measurements at 1, 2, and 3weeks after treatment, and at 3, 6,
   12, and 24months following treatment with imaging and QOL
   assessments.DiscussionThe primary objective of this randomized trial is
   to determine whether RFA/PVA in addition to EBRT improves pain control
   compared to palliative EBRT alone for patients with spine metastasis,
   defined as complete or partial pain relief (measured using the Numerical
   Rating Pain Scale {[}NRPS]) at 3months. Secondary objectives include
   determining whether combined modality treatment improves the rapidity of
   pain response, duration of pain response, patient reported pain impact,

Abstract = {{Background Dementia, depression, and delirium alone or in combination
   (3Ds) can threaten independence among older adults, and polypharmacy may
   further accelerate decline. Clinical pharmacists can play an important
   role on multidisciplinary home-based care teams by identifying
   medication therapy problems (MTPs) involving cognition. Within a larger
   ongoing clinical trial, this paper describes cognition-related MTPs and
   pharmacist recommendations among older adults with 3Ds followed by a
   home-based care team. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of
   medication data among Medicare Advantage members aged >= 65 years living
   at home in Connecticut with International Statistical Classification of
   Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision codes related to
   3Ds; analyses include the first 105 subjects randomized to the
   home-based care team from March 2017 to January 2019. Advanced practice
   registered nurses conducted in-home medication reconciliations along
   with medical and cognitive assessments. Clinical pharmacists then
   conducted medication reviews centered on agents treating or exacerbating
   3Ds. After review by the study advanced practice registered nurse,
   geriatrician, and psychiatrist, salient recommendations were forwarded
   to primary care providers for consideration. Medication therapy problems
   related to cognition were retrospectively abstracted and classified as:
   (1) indication: underuse or overuse; (2) effectiveness: ineffective
   agent or low dose (mainly for antidepressants); and (3) safety:
   undesirable effect (e.g., impaired cognition, dementia treatment side
   effects), unsafe medication (e.g., potentially inappropriate medications
   that can harm cognition), drug interaction, or high dose. Results
   Pharmacists identified 166 cognitive MTPs, with a mean (standard
   deviation) of 1.58 (1.35) {[}range 0-6] MTPs per subject. Indication
   MTPs represented 34\% of total MTPs, of which 79\% involved underuse and
   21\% overuse; effectiveness represented 13\% of total MTPs; and safety
   represented over half (52\%) of all MTPs, with benzodiazepines and
   anticholinergics frequently implicated. Recommendations commonly
   included medication reduction (discontinuation 23\% and dose reduction
   19\%). We found MTPs involving cognition among most (79\%) patients.
   Conclusions Our study findings support the role of pharmacists on
   multidisciplinary teams to identify cognitively harmful medications,
   dementia treatment side effects, and untreated cognitive conditions.}},

Title = {{Reduced insecticide susceptibility of the wheat aphid Sitobion miscanthi
   after infection by the secondary bacterial symbiont Hamiltonella defensa}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Bacterial symbionts in insects, especially aphids, have a
   major influence on host adaptation. We previously showed that infection
   with the secondary symbiont Hamiltonella defensa increases the fitness
   of the wheat aphid Sitobion miscanthi, yielding increases in fitness
   parameters such as adult weight and offspring number. However, whether
   H. defensa affects the sensitivity of host aphids to insecticides
   remains unknown.
   RESULTS We tested the effects of H. defensa on host aphid susceptibility
   to the insecticides chlorpyrifos methyl, imidacloprid, cyantraniliprole
   and acetamiprid. Our results showed that compared with Hamiltonella-free
   aphid clones, Hamiltonella-infected aphid clones exhibited lower
   sensitivity to most of the tested insecticides at low concentrations.
   Quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed that the density of H.
   defensa in the infected clones was slightly decreased at 24 h but then
   sharply increased until the late stage after treatment with the
   different insecticides. H. defensa in the host aphids was detected by
   fluorescence in situ hybridization and was localized to the aphid
   hindgut. Levels of the detoxification enzymes acetylcholinesterase,
   glutathione transferase and carboxylesterase were significantly higher
   in Hamiltonella-infected clones than in Hamiltonella-free clones.
   CONCLUSIONS The findings indicated that infection with H. defensa
   reduced aphid susceptibility to the investigated insecticides at low
   concentrations, potentially by increasing detoxification enzyme activity
   in the host. Therefore, symbiont-mediated insecticide resistance should
   be taken into account when performing resistance-monitoring studies.
   Studies of symbiont-mediated insecticide resistance may enhance our
   understanding of the emergence of insecticide resistance in agricultural
   systems.}},

Title = {{The Approach to Carbon Emission Quotas of Road Transportation: A Carbon
   Emission Intensity Perspective}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Carbon trading is an effective measure for the road transportation to
   reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. Carbon emission quotas
   are the primary concern to ensuring the efficiency of carbon trading.
   However, the existing studies have mostly focused on carbon emission
   quotas in different regions, i.e., countries and provinces. Few
   literature studies simulate carbon quota allocation in the road
   transportation. A novel approach from the perspective of carbon emission
   intensity of vehicle is proposed, on the basis of data envelopment
   analysis (DEA) model. Unlike other studies, the idea of allocation of
   baseline excitation is introduced and the intensity is included in the
   model as the baseline. Firstly, the Delphi method is employed to select
   input and output indicators. Secondly, carbon emission intensity is
   determined by the cumulative distribution function (CDF). Furthermore,
   the carbon emission quotas in road transportation in 30 provinces of
   China are used to validate the model. The results show that (1) the
   carbon emission intensity of commercial trucks and buses in China's road
   transport industry is 75.04 g/t center dot km and 13.12 g/p center dot
   km, respectively; (2) the provinces of Shanghai, Guangdong, and Xinjiang
   have the greatest carbon reduction potential and Henan, Hunan, and Anhui
   have the largest increase in emission quotas; (3) compared with
   traditional ``history responsibility{''} and ``baseline{''} methods, the
   proposed approach increases allocation efficiency by 19\% and 14\%,
   respectively; and (4) the approach can make the carbon emission quotas
   play the role of incentive while taking fairness into account and can
   more effectively promote the implementation of carbon trading system in
   road transportation.}},

Abstract = {{A multistep phase sequence following the crystallization of amorphous
   Al2O3 via solid-phase epitaxy (SPE) points to methods to create
   low-defect-density thin films of the metastable cubic gamma-Al2O3
   polymorph. An amorphous Al2O3 thin film on a (0001) alpha-Al2O3 sapphire
   substrate initially transforms upon heating to form epitaxial
   gamma-Al2O3, followed by a transformation to monoclinic 0-Al2O3, and
   eventually to alpha-Al2O3. Epitaxial gamma-Al2O3 layers with low mosaic
   widths in X-ray rocking curves can be formed via SPE by crystallizing
   the gamma-Al2O3 phase from amorphous Al2O3 and avoiding the
   microstructural inhomogeneity arising from the spatially inhomogeneous
   transformation to theta-Al2O3. A complementary molecular dynamics (MD)
   simulation indicates that the amorphous layer and gamma-Al2O3 have
   similar Al coordination geometry, suggesting that gamma-Al2O3 forms in
   part because it involves the minimum rearrangement of the initially
   amorphous configuration. The lattice parameters of gamma-Al2O3 are
   consistent with a structure in which the majority of the Al vacancies in
   the spinel structure occupy sites with tetrahedral coordination,
   consistent with the MD results. The formation of Al vacancies at
   tetrahedral spinel sites in epitaxial gamma-Al2O3 can minimize the
   epitaxial elastic deformation of gamma-Al2O3 during crystallization.}},

Title = {{Development and Validation of a Combined Ferroptosis and Immune
   Prognostic Classifier for Hepatocellular Carcinoma}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Immunotherapy and sorafenib exert anti-tumor effects via
   ferroptosis, but reliable biomarkers for the individual treatment and
   prognosis prediction of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based on the
   ferroptosis and immune status remain lacking.
   Methods: Ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) were identified by downloading
   data from FerrDb and by searching and reading original articles from
   PubMed. Immune-related genes (IRGs) were downloaded from ImmPort.
   Prognostic FRGs and IRGs in the GSE14520 (n = 220) and The Cancer Genome
   Atlas (TCGA, n = 365) datasets were identified. Least absolute shrinkage
   and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression and multivariate Cox
   regression were used for model construction. Ferroptosis expression
   profiles, the infiltration of immune cells, and the somatic mutation
   status were analyzed and compared.
   Results: Twenty-seven prognostic ferroptosis- and immune-related
   signatures were included to construct a comprehensive index of
   ferroptosis and immune status (CIFI). A subgroup of patients was
   identified as having a high CIFI value, which was associated with a
   worse prognosis. This subgroup of patients had significantly
   up-regulated expressions of many suppressors of ferroptosis and higher
   fractions of immunosuppressive cells, such as cancer-associated
   fibroblasts (CAFs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs).
   Notably, somatic mutation analysis indicated that high-CIFI patients had
   higher levels of tumor heterogeneity and higher mutation frequencies of
   genes like TP53.
   Conclusion: In this work, a novel prognostic classifier was developed
   based on ferroptosis- and IRGs in HCC, and this classifier could be used
   for prognostic prediction and the selection of patients for
   immunotherapies and targeted therapies.}},

Abstract = {{The development of intelligent and multifunctional hydrogels having
   photothermal properties, good mechanical properties, sustained drug
   release abilities with low burst release, antibacterial properties, and
   biocompatibility is highly desirable in the biomaterial field. Herein,
   mesoporous polydopamine (MPDA) nanoparticles wrapped with graphene oxide
   (GO) were physically cross-linked in cellulose nanofibril (CNF) hydrogel
   to obtain a novel MPDA@GO/CNF composite hydrogel for controllable drug
   release. MPDA nanoparticles exhibited a high drug loading ratio (up to
   35 wt \%) for tetracycline hydrochloride (TH). GO was used to
   encapsulate MPDA nanoparticles for extending the drug release time and
   reinforcing the physical strength of the obtained hydrogel. The
   mechanical strength of the as-fabricated MPDA@GO/CNF composite hydrogel
   was five times greater compared to that of the pure CNF hydrogel. Drug
   release experiments demonstrated that burst release behavior was
   significantly reduced by adding MPDA@GO. The drug release time of the
   MPDA@GO/CNF composite hydrogel was 3 times and 7.2 times longer than
   that of the polydopamine/CNF hydrogel and pure CNF hydrogel,
   respectively. The sustained and controlled drug release behaviors of the
   composite hydrogel were highly dependent on the proportion of MPDA and
   GO. Moreover, the rate of drug release could be accelerated by
   near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation and pH value change. The drug
   release kinetics of the as-prepared composite hydrogel was well
   described by the Korsmeyer-Peppas model, and the drug release mechanism
   of TH from the composite hydrogel was anomalous transport. Importantly,
   this carefully designed MPDA@GO/CNF composite hydrogel showed good
   biocompatibility through an in vitro cytotoxicity test. In particular,
   the toxicity of GO was well shielded by the CNF hydrogel. Therefore,
   this novel MPDA@GO/CNF composite hydrogel with an encapsulation
   structure for controllable drug release and toxicity shielding of GO
   could be used as a very promising controlled drug delivery carrier,
   which may have potential applications for chemical and physical
   therapies.}},

   applied to detect expression of circRNA-circHmbox1 and miR-1247-5p in
   TNF-alpha-induced osteoclasts differentiation. Western blot, TRAP
   staining, alkaline phosphatase staining, alizarin red S staining,
   transwell and cell transfection were conducted to confirm that TNF-alpha
   inhibited osteoblasts differentiation by exosomal with low circHmbox1
   expression from osteoclasts. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase
   reporter revealed the mechanisms of the circHmbox1/miR-1247-5p/B cell
   lymphoma 6 (Bcl6) interaction. In this study, we found that the level of
   circRNA-circHmbox1 was obviously reduced in TNF-alpha-induced osteoclast
   formation in vivo and in vitro. CircHmbox1 could inhibit RANKL-induced
   osteoclasts differentiation primarily through binding to
   microRNA-1247-5p. TNF-alpha decreased osteoblasts differentiation by
   exosomal with low circHmbox1 expression from osteoclasts. Mechanistic
   studies showed that microRNA-1247-5p regulated osteoclasts
   differentiation and osteoblasts differentiation by targeting Bcl6, which
   was confirmed to play opposite roles in osteoblasts differentiation and
   osteoclasts differentiation. Our results provide evidence that
   circHmbox1-targeting miR-1247-5p is involved in the regulation of bone
   metabolisms by TNF-alpha in PMOP.}},

Abstract = {{Concerning the mal-operation of distance protection in AC/DC hybrid
   system due to commutation failure in DC system caused by AC-side fault,
   a novel AC line distance protection scheme based on fault likeness
   factor is proposed. First, by analysing the conducting state of
   converter in different time intervals, the expression of feed-in current
   from DC system to AC system is derived. On this basis, combining AC-side
   fault component network, the fault location equation considering the
   impact of feed-in current from DC system is established. Thus, by
   solving the equation consisting of information at multiple time
   sections, the fault location is calculated. And then, according to the
   consistency between the calculated fault location and actual fault
   location, the fault likeness factor is constructed to distinguish
   between in-zone and out-of-zone faults. Finally, simulation tests in
   RT-LAB verify that, the proposed scheme can identify in-zone and
   out-of-zone faults fast and accurately in the case of commutation
   failure caused by different types of fault, strongly immune to fault
   resistance.}},

Title = {{A Preliminary Investigation of the Views of People With Parkinson's

   Trials During the Covid-19 Pandemic: An Online Survey}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY}},

Abstract = {{Background: The coronavirus pandemic is having a profound impact on
   non-COVID-19 related research, including the delivery of clinical trials
   for patients with Parkinson's disease.
   Objectives: A preliminary investigation to explore the views of
   Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, with and without experience of
   psychosis symptoms, and carers on the resumption of clinical research
   and adaptations to trials in light of COVID-19.
   Methods: An anonymous self-administered online survey was completed by
   30 PD patients and six family members/carers via the Parkinson's UK
   Research Support Network to explore current perceptions on taking part
   in PD research and how a planned clinical trial for psychosis in PD may
   be adapted so participants feel safe.
   Results: Ninety-one percent of respondents were enthusiastic about the
   continuation of non-COVID-19 related research as long as certain safety
   measures were in place. Ninety-four percent stated that they would be
   happy to complete assessments virtually. However, they noted that care
   should be taken to ensure that this does not exclude participants,
   particularly those with more advanced PD who may require assistance
   using portable electronic devices. Regular and supportive communication
   from the research team was also seen as important for maintaining the
   psychological well-being of participants while taking part in the trial.
   Conclusions: In the era of COVID-19 pandemic, standard approaches will
   have to be modified and rapid adoption of virtual assessments will be
   critical for the continuation of clinical research. It is important that
   alongside the traditional methods, new tools are developed, and older
   ones validated for virtual assessments, to allow safe and comprehensive
   assessments vital for ongoing research in people with Parkinson's.}},

Journal = {{DISABILITY AND REHABILITATION}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   This qualitative study aimed to explore the experiences of parents
   supporting their child with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and
   overweight or obesity (OW/OB), including their weight management support
   needs.
   Methods
   Interview transcripts were analysed using inductive thematic analysis.
   Nine parents (n = 9 mothers) of ten children with ASD (7 males, 3
   females) participated in individual semi-structured interviews.
   Results
   The three themes developed were: (1) Our journey to obtain weight
   management support; (2) I need real-world solutions; and (3) The what,
   who and how of our weight management needs. Parents reported being
   proactive in seeking weight management support for their child but were
   disappointed with the services offered. Resources were not tailored to
   the child's complex nutrition and behavioural issues or their abilities
   and functioning. A multidisciplinary approach that integrated both
   disability and weight management expertise was desired, but not
   experienced. A range of formal and informal programs were recommended.
   Conclusion
   This study provides a call to action for supports that ensure children
   with ASD and OW/OB receive integrated, individualised support to
   maximise their health and wellness.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of quark anomalous magnetic moment (AMM) to chiral

   magnetic field for a small quark AMM, but decreases with magnetic field
   for a large quark AMM. The critical temperature of chiral restoration

Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{308-319}},
Month = {{MAY 4}},
Abstract = {{Background and Objectives of the article
   Loss aversion bias, whereby losses loom larger than gains, can be
   reduced by stress. At the same time, vigorous physical exercise is a
   powerful neuroendocrine stressor and heart rate variability (HRV)
   provides an objective measure of the actual exercise impact, relative to
   each individual physical condition. Our aim was to study whether
   vigorous exercise can influence loss aversion, considering HRV in this
   relation. We hypothesized that the lower HRV derived from vigorous
   exercise (i.e., when stressor produced the most impact) would predict a
   lower loss aversion.
   Methods
   Two groups (Experimental, N = 37; Control, N = 39) completed a loss
   aversion task, but the experimental group was exposed to an acute
   physical stressor before.
   Results
   Results revealed a significant group x HRV interaction. In the control
   group, HRV was not associated with loss aversion. Conversely, as
   hypothesized, the lower HRV levels derived from exercise were associated
   with a lesser loss aversion in the experimental group.
   Conclusions
   Results suggest that physiological changes from physical exercise could
   affect decision-making by reducing loss aversion.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Huge amounts of anthropogenic environmental pollutants appearing in
   nature mean an emerging problem. Oil shale is a convenient candidate,
   wherewith these contaminations can be removed from our natural
   environment, taking into account its sorption ability and low price.
   However, oil shale has a crumbling nature, which restricts its facile
   usage. Hence, oil shale was transformed into more handleable forms,
   using binding materials. Two oil shale composite forms were prepared by
   applying sodium alginate and agar. A cationic and an anionic chemicals,
   benzyltriethylammonium chloride and sodium
   2,3-diisopropylnaphthalene-1-sulfonate, respectively, were used as model
   pollutants, and their sorptions on these newly prepared composites were
   studied. Sorption properties of oil shale powder and oil shale
   composites were compared. In the composite materials, oil shale properly
   sorbed the model pollutants (the binding material did not cover the
   sorption sites); furthermore, oil shale composites had significantly
   higher removal efficiency compared to that of the oil shale powder: 208
   +/- 15.6 (oil shale-agar) and 171 +/- 22.8 (oil shale-alginate) vs 140
   +/- 11.1 mu mol/g for the cationic compound; 151 +/- 1.6 (oil
   shale-agar) and 165 +/- 7.6 (oil shale-alginate) vs 81.5 +/- 2.6 mu
   mol/g for the anionic compound. Results of diffusion models for the two
   composites show that the opposite charges of the solutes largely
   influence the rate of their diffusion, owing to the interaction between
   the solute and the composite material. These results indicate that oil
   shale and its composites are applicable candidates as sorbents, from
   which the most effective one can be chosen by considering the chemical
   properties of the actual pollutant to be removed.}},

Abstract = {{Exploring the potential of eucalyptol as a masking agent for aversive
   odors, we found that eucalyptol masks the olfactory but not the
   trigeminal sensation of ammonia in a previous study. Here, we further
   investigate the processing of a mixture consisting of eucalyptol and
   ammonia, two olfactory-trigeminal stimuli. We presented the two pure
   odors and a mixture thereof to 33 healthy participants. The nostrils
   were stimulated alternately (monorhinal application). We analyzed the
   behavioral ratings (intensity and pleasantness) and functional brain
   images. First, we replicated our previous finding that, within the
   mixture, the eucalyptol component suppressed the olfactory intensity of
   the ammonia component. Second, mixture pleasantness was rated
   differently by participants depending on which component dominated their
   mixture perception. Approximately half of the volunteers rated the
   eucalyptol component as more intense and evaluated the mixture as
   pleasant (pleasant group). The other half rated the ammonia component as
   more intense and evaluated the mixture as unpleasant (unpleasant group).
   Third, these individual differences were also found in functional
   imaging data. Contrasting the mixture either to eucalyptol or to both
   single odors, neural activation was found in the unpleasant group only.
   Activation in the anterior insula and SII was interpreted as evidence
   for an attentional shift towards the potentially threatening mixture
   component ammonia and for trigeminal enhancement. In addition to insula
   and SII, further regions of the pain matrix were involved when assessing
   all participant responses to the mixture. Both a painful sensation and
   an attentional shift towards the unpleasant mixture component
   complicates the development of an efficient mask because a pleasant
   perception is an important requirement for malodor coverage.}},

Title = {{Capability of oxygen-scavenger sachets and modified atmosphere packaging
   to extend fresh barberry shelf life}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL TECHNOLOGIES IN AGRICULTURE}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Background Barberry has long been used as an herbal remedy since ancient
   times which is found throughout temperate and subtropical regions of the
   world. Given the short harvesting season and limited shelf life of the
   barberry, we evaluated the possibility of using modified atmosphere
   packaging and oxygen-scavenger sachets to increase its storage period.
   For this purpose, the physicochemical characterization (antioxidant
   activity, anthocyanin, phenolic compounds, and ascorbic acid content,
   acidity, firmness, color, and decay incident) of fresh barberry samples
   packaged within different atmospheres was investigated over 4 weeks of
   storage at 4 and 25 degrees C. The barberries were packaged with
   low-density polyethylene/polyester (LDPE/PET) films under natural
   atmosphere (C), N-2 gas (N), vacuum (V), or in the presence of an oxygen
   scavenger (OS). Results The results revealed that with increased storage
   period, the O-2 and CO2 levels inside the packages decreased and
   increased, respectively. The antioxidant activity and amounts of
   anthocyanin, phenolic compounds, and ascorbic acid all decreased with
   increasing storage period. Among the studied atmospheres, the OS and,
   subsequently, V packages were most capable of maintaining the quality of
   fresh barberries, with the decay incidence being approximately 30 times
   lower inside these packages relative to the control. Increasing the
   storage temperature accelerated the intensity of chemical changes and
   decay across all samples. Conclusion The barberries inside the OS
   packages stored at 4 degrees C (and even at 25 degrees C) still had good
   sensory properties in terms of chemical properties, texture, and color
   after 4 weeks. Fortunately, it seems that this packaging technology
   makes the exportation and delayed consumption of the fresh barberry
   possible by maintaining its quality.}},

Abstract = {{The order of magnitude of increased growth, multiplication rate, and
   decreased sporulation of Bacillus subtilis after exposure to nanotesla
   magnetic fields (MFs) relative to control samples were observed

   158 nT in eight subsequent experiments by using three pairs of Helmholtz
   coils combined with Mu-metal shielding. The growth, multiplication rate,
   sporulation, and potassium content were measured in the probe and
   control containing B. subtilis cultures after 24 h of exposure to
   nanotesla and Earth's magnetic fields, respectively. The observed effect
   is discussed with regard to its possible repercussions on Earth's living
   species during geomagnetic reversals that occurred when the magnetic
   field was much weaker than the field that exists today. In addition,
   effects on future manned voyages into deep space, an environment with

Title = {{An updated version of the global interior ocean biogeochemical data
   product, GLODAPv2.2020}},
Journal = {{EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{3653-3678}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{The Global Ocean Data Analysis Project (GLODAP) is a synthesis effort
   providing regular compilations of surface-to-bottom ocean biogeochemical
   data, with an emphasis on seawater inorganic carbon chemistry and
   related variables determined through chemical analysis of seawater
   samples. GLODAPv2.2020 is an update of the previous version,
   GLODAPv2.2019. The major changes are data from 106 new cruises added,
   extension of time coverage to 2019, and the inclusion of available (also
   for historical cruises) discrete fugacity of CO2 (fCO(2)) values in the
   merged product files. GLODAPv2.2020 now includes measurements from more
   than 1.2 million water samples from the global oceans collected on 946
   cruises. The data for the 12 GLODAP core variables (salinity, oxygen,
   nitrate, silicate, phosphate, dissolved inorganic carbon, total
   alkalinity, pH, CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-113, and CCl4) have undergone
   extensive quality control with a focus on systematic evaluation of bias.
   The data are available in two formats: (i) as submitted by the data
   originator but updated to WOCE exchange format and (ii) as a merged data
   product with adjustments applied to minimize bias. These adjustments
   were derived by comparing the data from the 106 new cruises with the
   data from the 840 quality-controlled cruises of the GLODAPv2.2019 data
   product using crossover analysis. Comparisons to empirical algorithm
   estimates provided additional context for adjustment decisions; this is
   new to this version. The adjustments are intended to remove potential
   biases from errors related to measurement, calibration, and
   data-handling practices without removing known or likely time trends or
   variations in the variables evaluated. The compiled and adjusted data
   product is believed to be consistent to better than 0.005 in salinity, 1
   \% in oxygen, 2 \% in nitrate, 2 \% in silicate, 2 \% in phosphate, 4 mu
   mol kg(-1) in dissolved inorganic carbon, 4 mu mol kg(-1) in total
   alkalinity, 0.01-0.02 in pH (depending on region), and 5 \% in the
   halogenated transient tracers. The other variables included in the
   compilation, such as isotopic tracers and discrete fCO(2), were not
   subjected to bias comparison or adjustments.
   The original data and their documentation and DOI codes are available at
   the Ocean Carbon Data System of NOAA NCEI
   (https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/ocads/oceans/GLODAPv2\_2020/, last access: 20
   June 2020). This site also provides access to the merged data product,
   which is provided as a single global file and as four regional ones -
   the Arctic, Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans - under
   https://doi-org.ez54.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.25921/2c8h-sa89 (Olsen et al., 2020). These
   bias-adjusted product files also include significant ancillary and
   approximated data. These were obtained by interpolation of, or
   calculation from, measured data. This living data update documents the
   GLODAPv2.2020 methods and provides a broad overview of the secondary
   quality control procedures and results.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Food must be acceptable, affordable, and available to consumers and
   consumers must have the resources, knowledge, and correct mindset to
   purchase and consume these foods. The narrative of this study centered
   on moving biofortified food closer to market by looking at awareness,
   adoption, and consumer mindsets as pillars to achieve market access. Our
   findings show that in Abia state, Nigeria, consumers are aware of
   biofortified cassava. This signifies a high market potential and
   economic opportunity for stakeholders in the supply chain.
   Unfortunately, consumers lack understanding of biofortified cassava's
   nutrition value. The high adoption level of biofortified cassava has
   implications on investment and stimulation of the local economy. The
   study identified accessibility, purposefulness and innovation as vital
   mindset drivers to scale market demand, and factors that affect both
   consumption, production, and marketing of the product. This study
   provides insight regarding potential priority areas of action for
   government policy interventions to stimulate demand and supply
   opportunities. This study also provides evidence that scaling up demand
   will depend on awareness creation. There is a need to improve
   communication networks to provide overwhelming product acceptance,
   adoption, and consumption of biofortified cassava. This will help change
   remaining myths about agro-biotechnology and the bioeconomy.}},

   power-based droop control and state-of-charge (SoC) based droop control
   of the battery are designed to regulate the dc bus voltage. Considering
   the dc bus voltages, a power management controller is implemented for
   IBD. It operates by the normalized voltages of subgrids. IBD helps to
   regulate the dc bus voltages by sharing power among the subgrids.
   Further, a coordinated power control method is applied to the
   distributed generation (DG) controller. In full-charging mode or high
   SoC mode of battery, it regulates the DG power generation. Hence,
   storage and generation coordination can be achieved. In an overloaded
   case, a load curtailment process is developed to regulate the dc bus
   voltage at its lower cut off value. The dc bus voltages act as
   information carriers to IBD and DG controllers. Hence, the proposed
   method does not depend on the communication line, which improves system
   reliability. The power management strategy has been implemented in
   islanded dc microgrid in Matlab/Simulink. Its results are compared with
   the conventional dc bus-signaling method to analyze its effectiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The primary aim of the study was determining the validation
   of the modified 19-item Frailty Index (mFI-19), based on the standard
   procedure for creating a frailty index scoring in the accumulation
   deficit theory of Rockwood and comparing it with the gold standard
   comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) in old age patients with hip
   fracture. As a secondary aim, we compared prognostic accuracies of
   mFI-19 and CGA in predicting long-term mortality after surgery.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 364 older patients with hip fractures,
   each a candidate for surgery, were consecutively enrolled. All were
   subjected to CGA and mFI-19 at baseline and time to death (years from
   hip surgery) were collected prospectively.
   Results: Mean patient age was 86.5 (SD: 5.65) years. The most common
   clinical phenotype (77\%) was frail. Both CGA and mFI-19 performed
   similarly in predicting long-term mortality (Harrell's C-index: 0.66 and
   0.68, respectively).
   Conclusions: The mFI-19 was validated, compared to the gold standard
   CGA, based on a systematic process for creating a frailty index in
   relation to the accumulation deficit. This is one of few prospective
   studies addressing long-term mortality in older adults with hip
   fractures, invoking a methodologically robust frailty screening
   assessment.}},

Title = {{Radixin modulates the function of outer hair cell stereocilia}},
Journal = {{COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{The stereocilia of the inner ear sensory cells contain the actin-binding
   protein radixin, encoded by RDX. Radixin is important for hearing but
   remains functionally obscure. To determine how radixin influences
   hearing sensitivity, we used a custom rapid imaging technique to
   visualize stereocilia motion while measuring electrical potential
   amplitudes during acoustic stimulation. Radixin inhibition decreased
   sound-evoked electrical potentials. Other functional measures, including
   electrically induced sensory cell motility and sound-evoked stereocilia
   deflections, showed a minor amplitude increase. These unique functional
   alterations demonstrate radixin as necessary for conversion of sound
   into electrical signals at acoustic rates. We identified patients with
   RDX variants with normal hearing at birth who showed rapidly
   deteriorating hearing during the first months of life. This may be
   overlooked by newborn hearing screening and explained by multiple
   disturbances in postnatal sensory cells. We conclude radixin is
   necessary for ensuring normal conversion of sound to electrical signals
   in the inner ear.
   Sonal Prasad et al. identify several mutations in the radixin (RDX) gene
   that are associated with early-life hearing loss. Using a guinea pig
   model, they propose that radixin helps convert sound into electrical
   signals in the mature inner ear.}},

Title = {{Evidence of eddy-related deep-ocean current variability in the northeast
   tropical Pacific Ocean induced by remote gap winds}},
Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{6527-6544}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{There has been a steady increase in interest in mining of deep-sea
   minerals in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) in the eastern Pacific
   Ocean during the last decade. This region is known to be one of the most
   eddy-rich regions in the world ocean. Typically, mesoscale eddies are
   generated by intense wind bursts channeled through gaps in the Sierra
   Madre mountains in Central America. Here, we use a combination of
   satellite and in situ observations to evaluate the relationship between
   deep-sea current variability in the region of potential future mining
   and eddy kinetic energy (EKE) in the vicinity of gap winds.
   A geometry-based eddy detection algorithm has been applied to altimetry
   sea surface height data for a period of 24 years, from 1993 to 2016, in
   order to analyze the main characteristic parameters and the
   spatiotemporal variability of mesoscale eddies in the northeast tropical
   Pacific Ocean (NETP). Significant differences between the
   characteristics of eddies with different polarity (cyclonic vs.
   anticyclonic) were found.
   For eddies with lifetimes longer than 1 d, cyclonic polarity is more
   common than anticyclonic rotation. However, anticyclonic eddies are
   larger in size, show stronger vorticity, and survive longer in the ocean
   than cyclonic eddies (often 90 d or more). Besides the polarity of
   eddies, the location of eddy formation should be taken into
   consideration when investigating the impacted deep-ocean region as we
   found eddies originating from the Tehuantepec (TT) gap winds lasting
   longer in the ocean and traveling farther distances in a different
   direction compared to eddies produced by the Papagayo (PP) gap winds.
   Long-lived anticyclonic eddies gen-erated by the TT gap winds are
   observed to travel distances up to 4500 km offshore, i.e., as far as
   west of (110)ffi W.
   EKE anomalies observed in the surface of the central ocean at distances
   of ca. 2500 km from the coast correlate with the seasonal variability of
   EKE in the region of the TT gap winds with a time lag of 5-6 months. A
   significant seasonal variability of deep-ocean current velocities at
   water depths of 4100m was observed in multiple-year time series data,
   likely reflecting the energy transfer of the surface EKE generated by
   the gap winds to the deep ocean. Furthermore, the influence of mesoscale
   eddies on deep-ocean currents is examined by analyzing the deep-ocean
   current measurements when an anticyclonic eddy crosses the study region.
   Our findings suggest that despite the significant modulation of dominant
   current directions driven by the bottom-reaching eddy, the current
   magnitude intensification was not strong enough to trigger local
   sediment resuspension in this region. A better insight into the annual
   variability of ocean surface mesoscale activity in the CCZ and its
   effects on deep-ocean current variability can be of great help to
   mitigate the impact of future potential deep-sea mining activities on
   the benthic ecosystem. On an interannual scale, a significant
   relationship between cyclonic eddy characteristics and El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO) was found, whereas a weaker correlation was detected
   for anticyclonic eddies.}},

Abstract = {{Soil temperature, texture, water content and sowing depth are effective
   factors on the estimation of emergence time. This research aimed to test
   the Beta model for its adequacy in predicting the time of emergence for
   sugar beet. The Beta growth model as a phenological model have been used
   for evaluating the time of seedling emergences under both controlled
   environments in laboratory and field conditions. An experiment was
   conducted both in the laboratory with five soil textures, three sowing
   depths, five soil water contents and ten constant soil temperatures,
   under field conditions on five sowing dates (20 February, 28 March, 19
   April, 10 May, and 31 May) and three sowing depths. The results
   demonstrated that the Beta model can predict the time of emergence.
   Based on the root mean square error (RMSE), the time of emergence
   estimated by the Beta model was in high agreement with the time of
   emergence measured in the laboratory. Estimation accuracy was reduced
   slightly by the Beta model under field conditions. The accuracy of the
   Beta model was influenced by the sowing date under field conditions. So,
   on the first and second sowing dates (with low air temperature), the
   estimation of time of emergence by the model was lower and on the fourth
   and the fifth sowing date (with warmer air temperature), was more than
   the duration measured. Estimation accuracy was increased by the Beta
   model under field conditions using soil temperature. In conclusion, the
   Beta model can predict the time to emergence of sugar beet seedlings in
   different levels of soil texture and soil water content under field
   conditions, and with that, the proper planting date for sugar beet seeds
   to overcome weeds in different soil water content can be predicted.}},

Abstract = {{The previous studies have shown that capital market integration has
   increased in the ASEAN-5, implying that investors making investment
   diversification across ASEAN capital markets could only earn limited
   diversification advantages. To diversify their portfolios, equity
   investors must find other assets. The main focus of this research is to
   analyze the effectiveness of put replication, gold, and oil on hedge
   equities in the ASEAN-5 (Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and
   the Philippines). Protective put strategy, DCC-GARCH, and Markowitz
   optimization are used to measure hedge effectiveness,
   risk-adjusted-performance such as Sharpe ratio, drawdown, and Omega
   ratio. The result reveals that gold is a cheaper hedge than oil and
   oil-hedged strategy is more expensive in ASEAN-5 compared to oil
   exporting nations. Also, investors with big exposure to the oil-related
   portfolio should diversify to Philippine equity. From hedging
   effectiveness and risk-adjusted-performance perspectives, oil is less
   attractive than money market instruments and gold. This study also
   implies that risk-averse investors should prefer to put replication or
   guaranteed financial products compared to commodities-hedged strategy.}},

Title = {{Does the Use of Social Media Tools in Classrooms Increase Student
   Commitment to Corporate Social Responsibility?}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{There is an increasing demand for ethical and Corporate Social
   Responsibility (CSR) practices by companies. This competence has to be
   introduced in students' training in business degree programs, and a
   check must then be done to determine if the students have come to
   appreciate the importance of CSR commitments. Using the framework of
   Stakeholders Theory, this work aims to examine students' perceptions of
   ethical and CSR practices and commitment to different stakeholders, as
   well as the factors that lead students to act in a socially responsible
   way. Furthermore, we hope to identify how the perception of CSR can be
   improved when Web 2.0 and social media tools that have proven effective
   in transmitting emotions and values are used in classrooms to teach
   these ideas. To this end, a survey was carried out in the year 2019 with
   1,030 first-year students; it was administered at the beginning of the
   semester and also at the end of the semester after the training
   activities had been carried out. The main finding of the research is
   that students start with the belief that ethics and CSR are developed
   for reasons of image and legitimacy; however, after receiving training
   on these topics through tools that take into account emotions and
   values, they start to value the importance of the company as an agent of
   social change. The main practical and managerial implication is that
   methods based on Web 2.0 and social media tools are useful to teach
   ethics and CSR; the theoretical contribution is that students take into
   account the welfare of others. This finding contributes to Stakeholder
   Theory in a higher education context.}},

Abstract = {{By application of a comparative aroma extract dilution analysis on the
   volatile fractions isolated by solvent extraction and solvent-assisted
   flavor evaporation (SAFE) from fresh raw Chinese ginger (Zingiber
   officinale Roscoe) and roasted ginger, 21 or 33 odorants, respectively,
   with flavor dilution (FD) factors in the range of 32-4096 were
   identified. In raw ginger, the highest FD factors were found for
   (E)-isoeugenol, 1,8-cineol, vanillin, geranial, and linalool. After
   roasting, in particular, the FD factors of 3(methylthio)propanal (cooked
   potato-like), 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethy1-3(2H)-furanone (caramel-like),
   3-hydroxy-4,5-dimethyl-2(5H)-furanone (seasoning-like), and geraniol
   were substantially increased. The application of static
   headspace/olfactometry (SHO) on ground raw ginger revealed a high FD
   factor for highly volatile acetaldehyde which clearly decreased after
   roasting. By contrast, the SHO application revealed high FD factors for
   malty smelling methylpropanal and 3-methylbutanal, which both were
   exclusively detected in roasted ginger. Thirteen odorants, namely,
   decanoic acid, (Z)-2-decenal, (Z)-4-decenal,
   (E)-4,5-epoxy-(E)-2-decenal, (E)-4,5-epoxy-(E)-2-undecenal, fenchol,

Title = {{Topography and Traits Modulate Tree Performance and Drought Response in
   a Tropical Forest}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Predicting drought responses of individual trees in tropical forests
   remains challenging, in part because trees experience drought
   differently depending on their position in spatially heterogeneous
   environments. Specifically, topography and the competitive environment
   can influence the severity of water stress experienced by individual
   trees, leading to individual-level variation in drought impacts. A
   drought in 2015 in Puerto Rico provided the opportunity to assess how
   drought response varies with topography and neighborhood crowding in a
   tropical forest. In this study, we integrated 3 years of annual census
   data from the El Yunque Chronosequence plots with measurements of
   functional traits and LiDAR-derived metrics of microsite topography. We
   fit hierarchical Bayesian models to examine how drought,
   microtopography, and neighborhood crowding influence individual tree
   growth and survival, and the role functional traits play in mediating
   species' responses to these drivers. We found that while growth was
   lower during the drought year, drought had no effect on survival,
   suggesting that these forests are fairly resilient to a single-year
   drought. However, growth response to drought, as well as average growth
   and survival, varied with topography: tree growth in valley-like
   microsites was more negatively affected by drought, and survival was
   lower on steeper slopes while growth was higher in valleys. Neighborhood
   crowding reduced growth and increased survival, but these effects did
   not vary between drought/non-drought years. Functional traits provided
   some insight into mechanisms by which drought and topography affected
   growth and survival. For example, trees with high specific leaf area
   grew more slowly on steeper slopes, and high wood density trees were
   less sensitive to drought. However, the relationships between functional
   traits and response to drought and topography were weak overall. Species
   sorting across microtopography may drive observed relationships between
   average performance, drought response, and topography. Our results
   suggest that understanding species' responses to drought requires
   consideration of the microenvironments in which they grow. Complex
   interactions between regional climate, topography, and traits underlie
   individual and species variation in drought response.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundHuman milk is recommended for all very low birth weight
   infants. Breastmilk is highly variable in nutrient content, failing to
   meet the nutritional demands of this group. Fortification of human milk
   is recommended to prevent extrauterine growth retardation and associated
   poor neurodevelopmental outcome. However, standard fortification with
   fixed dose multicomponent fortifier does not account for the variability
   in milk composition. Targeted fortification is a promising alternative
   and needs further investigation.MethodsThis randomized controlled trial
   will recruit preterm infants (<= 32weeks of gestation) within the first
   7days of life. After reaching 80ml/kg/day of enteral feeding, patients
   will be randomized to receive standard fortification (HMF, Nutricia) or
   targeted fortification (modular components: Bebilon Bialka,
   Nutricia-protein; Polycal, Nutricia-carbohydrates; Calogen,
   Nutricia-lipids). The intervention will continue until 37weeks of

Abstract = {{Background Unroofed coronary sinus syndrome (UCSS) is rare and often
   associated with the left superior vena cava (LSVC). We report our
   experience of the clinical features, diagnosis, associated anomalies,
   surgical procedures, and late outcomes of UCSS during a 20-year period.
   Methods One hundred and fifty-nine patients with UCSS were treated
   surgically and followed up between May 1998 and May 2019. UCSS was
   confirmed by preoperative echocardiography or computerized tomography
   (CT) scan in 97 patients and by the surgeons intraoperatively in 62
   cases, and 100 cases were associated with LSVC. Among these patients,
   eight cases underwent ligation, and the intracardiac tunnel or baffle
   was reconstructed in 71 cases to ensure drainage of the LSVC into the
   right atrium (RA), and the extracardiac procedure was to lead the LSVC
   into the RA in three patients. Coronary sinus opening was diverted to
   the RA by the atrial septal patch in three cases. Thirteen patients
   underwent the reroof procedures, and two patients had untreated LSVC.
   The associated cardiac lesions were corrected concomitantly.
   Results There were five in-hospital deaths. Follow-up of 143 patients of
   early survivors was done, and no deaths were reported. No serious
   complications were observed, with the exception of avulsion of the
   internal tunnel patch in one patient.
   Conclusion UCSS is often misdiagnosed during preoperative evaluation of
   congenital heart diseases. Preoperative transthoracic echocardiography
   remains the most important method in the diagnosis of UCSS. We adopted
   multiple surgical approaches to manage the different types of UCSS with
   LSVC with good results.}},

   Seebeck and Peltier coefficients, their Onsager relations, the
   generalized Wiedemann-Franz law and the robustness of the Lorenz number,

Title = {{Flock-level risk factors for outbreaks of infectious arthritis in lambs,
   Norway 2018}},
Journal = {{ACTA VETERINARIA SCANDINAVICA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{62}},

Abstract = {{Background Outbreaks of infectious arthritis in young lambs associated
   with Streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies dysgalactiae (SDSD) lead to
   reduced animal welfare, increased use of antibiotics and economic losses
   for sheep farmers. Understanding risk factors is essential when
   developing strategies to prevent such outbreaks. This
   questionnaire-based cross-sectional study classified sheep flocks of
   respondents as cases or controls. Flock-level risk factors for outbreaks
   of infectious arthritis were assessed using a multivariable logistic
   regression model. Results Eighty-four of 1498 respondents (5.6\%)
   experienced an outbreak of infectious arthritis in their flock in 2018,
   the year of study. Factors associated with a higher risk of outbreak
   were larger flock size (OR 1.3, 95\% CI 1.1-1.4, per 100 lambs), plastic
   mesh flooring in the lambing pen (OR 3.0, 95\% CI 1.7-5.3) and a lambing
   percentage greater than 200 (OR 2.0, 95\% CI 1.1-3.5). Flocks where
   farmers observed infections around the ear tags of lambs also had an
   increased risk of outbreak (OR 2.6, 95\% CI 1.6-4.3). Conclusions The
   risk factors identified in this study are characteristic of modern and
   intensively managed sheep farms in Norway. A distinguishing feature of
   Norwegian sheep farming is winter housing and indoor lambing. One might
   expect that this in itself is a risk factor because of high stocking
   densities during lambing. However, outbreaks of infectious arthritis in
   young lambs are reported by the industry to be a more recent phenomenon.
   The current study indicates that intensification of indoor management
   systems with larger flocks and higher production per ewe may predispose
   to outbreaks. The results provide a basis for further studies on
   transmission dynamics of SDSD in sheep flocks with indoor lambing.}},

Abstract = {{A covalent adaptable network (CAN) with high glass transition
   temperature (T-g), superior mechanical properties including toughness
   and ductility, and unprecedented spatio-temporally controlled dynamic
   behavior is prepared by introducing dynamic moieties capable of
   reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) into
   photoinitiated copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition
   (CuAAC)-based networks. While the CuAAC polymerization yields glassy
   polymers composed of rigid triazole linkages with enhanced toughness,
   the RAFT moieties undergo bond exchange leading to stress relaxation
   upon light exposure. This unprecedented level of stress relaxation in
   the glassy state leads to numerous desirable attributes including glassy
   state photoinduced plasticity, toughness improvement during large
   deformation, and even photoinduced reversal of the effects of physical
   aging resulting in the rejuvenation of mechanical and thermodynamic
   properties in physically aged RAFT-CuAAC networks that undergo bond
   exchange in the glassy state. Surprisingly, when an
   allyl-sulfide-containing azide monomer (AS-N-3) is used to form the
   network, the network exhibits up to 80\% stress relaxation in the glassy
   state (T-g - 45 degrees C) under fixed displacement. In situ activation
   of RAFT during mechanical loading results in a 50\% improvement in
   elongation to break and 40\% improvement in the toughness when compared
   to the same network without light-activation of RAFT during the tensile
   testing.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Fungal cell wall integrity is vital for fungal pathogenesis
   and stress tolerance. Calcofluor white (CFW), a cell wall perturbing
   agent, inhibits fungal growth by binding chitin in the cell wall. The
   roles of CFW sensitive proteins remain insufficiently understood in
   pathogenic fungi.
   RESULTS We investigated two calcofluor white hypersensitive proteins,
   MaCwh1 and MaCwh43, in the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium acridum.
   Both Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged MaCwh1 and MaCwh43 localized
   at the endoplasmic reticulum. Our results showed that the Delta Macwh1
   and Delta Macwh43 mutants were more sensitive to CFW and ultraviolet
   irradiation stress compared to wild-type and complement strains. Delta
   Macwh1 had a stronger sensitivity to these stresses than Delta Macwh43.
   Both Delta Macwh1 and Delta Macwh43 mutants showed smoother cell wall
   surface, and drastically reduced chitin and mannose glycoprotein level
   in the cell wall and glycerol level in conidia compared to wild type.
   Insect bioassay showed significantly attenuated virulence for both Delta
   Macwh1 and Delta Macwh43 mutants with impaired ability in penetrating
   the host cuticle. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that a large number of genes
   presumably involved in cell wall construction and modification,
   pathogenicity and stress response were down-regulated in both Delta
   Macwh1 and Delta Macwh43 mutants.
   CONCLUSIONS These findings demonstrate that both Macwh1 and Macwh43
   affect the fungal cell wall ultrastructure and contribute to the stress
   tolerance and pest control potential in M. acrdium.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is the second most common cause of
   vision loss after diabetic retinopathy due to retinal vascular disease.
   Retinal nonperfusion (RNP), identified on fluorescein angiograms (FA)
   and appearing as hypofluorescence regions, is one of the most
   significant characteristics of RVO. Quantification of RNP is crucial for
   assessing the severity and progression of RVO. However, in current
   clinical practice, it is mostly conducted manually, which is
   time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone. The purpose of this study
   is to develop fully automated methods for segmentation of RNP using
   convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
   Methods FA images from 161 patients were analyzed, and RNP areas were
   annotated by three independent physicians. The optimal method to use
   multi-physicians' labeled data to train the CNNs was evaluated. An
   adaptive histogram-based data augmentation method was utilized to boost
   the CNN performance. CNN methods based on context encoder module were
   developed for automated segmentation of RNP and compared with existing
   state-of-the-art methods.
   Results The proposed methods achieved excellent agreements with
   physicians for segmentation of RNP in FA images. The CNN performance can
   be improved significantly by the proposed adaptive histogram-based data
   augmentation method. Using the averaged labels from physicians to train
   the CNNs achieved the best consensus with all physicians, with a mean
   accuracy of 0.883 +/- 0.166 with fivefold cross-validation.
   Conclusions We reported CNN methods to segment RNP in RVO in FA images.
   Our work can help improve clinical workflow, and can be useful for
   further investigating the association between RNP and retinal disease
   progression, as well as for evaluating the optimal treatments for the
   management of RVO.}},

Abstract = {{For decades El Salvador has been reliant on migration, mainly to the US,
   to provide remittances and an outlet for widespread underemployment. The
   deportation of tens of thousands of migrants annually by the United
   States, however, threatens to exacerbate problems of joblessness,
   poverty, and informality in local economies, calling into question the
   suitability of prevailing economic development strategies. This study
   proposes an alternative approach-labor force-based development-that was
   initially proposed to assist US cities confronting widespread job losses
   following deindustrialization. Through a survey of 198 Salvadorans who
   were apprehended by US immigration authorities and deported, this
   article documents deportees' employment experiences in El Salvador and
   the US, tenure in their primary occupation, education and training
   obtained, and the localities to which they will return. It also provides
   recommendations for improving the employment outcomes of deportees.
   Given that a substantial proportion of deportees have worked in the
   construction industry, opportunities exist for designing workforce
   development programs that meet the needs of jobseekers as well as local
   communities facing housing shortages.}},

Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundSpecies adaptation to laboratory conditions is a special case
   of domestication that has modified model organisms phenotypically and
   genetically. The characterisation of these changes is crucial to
   understand how this variation can affect the outcome of biological
   experiments. Yet despite the wide use of laboratory animals in
   biological research, knowledge of the genetic diversity within and
   between different strains and populations of some animal models is still
   scarce. This is particularly the case of the Mexican axolotl, which has
   been bred in captivity since 1864.ResultsUsing gene expression data from
   nine different projects, nucleotide sequence variants were
   characterised, and distinctive genetic background of the experimental
   specimens was uncovered. This study provides a catalogue of thousands of
   nucleotide variants along predicted protein-coding genes, while
   identifying genome-wide differences between pigment phenotypes in
   laboratory populations.ConclusionsAwareness of the genetic variation
   could guide a better experimental design while helping to develop
   molecular tools for monitoring genetic diversity and studying gene
   functions in laboratory axolotls. Overall, this study highlights the
   cross-taxa utility that transcriptomic data might have to assess the
   genetic variation of the experimental specimens, which might help to
   shorten the journey towards reproducible research.}},

Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: To evaluate changes in immunological parameters following
   subcutaneous (SC) and intramuscular (IM) administration of meperidine in
   horses through quantitative analysis of plasma tryptase, histamine, and
   IgE levels.
   Methods: Six adult horses were enrolled in a prospective randomized
   crossover design. Horses were administered one treatment per day, with a
   seven day washout period: (a) meperidine 1 mg/kg IM, saline 6 mL SC; (b)
   saline 6 mL IM, meperidine 1 mg/kg SC; (c) saline 6 mL SC, saline 6 mL
   IM. Blood samples were obtained for plasmatic histamine (baseline, 5,
   10, 15, 30, and 60 min) via LC-MS/MS and plasmatic tryptase (baseline,
   15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min) quantification with enzyme-linked
   immunoabsorbent assays. Serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) concentrations
   prior to any meperidine treatment and 7-14 days following the first
   meperidine treatment were evaluated with enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent
   assays. Histamine and tryptase concentrations were evaluated with a
   mixed-effect analysis of variance. The levels of IgE at baseline (before
   the administration of the first dose of meperidine) were compared with
   the IgE values at 60 min following the second meperidine administration
   with the Paired t test. Biopsies of localized injection site reactions
   from subcutaneous meperidine administration were collected from two
   horses.
   Results: No statistically significant elevations from baseline in
   histamine (p = 0.595), tryptase (p = 0.836), or IgE (p = 0.844) were
   found in any of the horses in this study. There were no differences
   between treatment groups. Administration of SC meperidine caused a
   localized vasculitis and thrombosis with regional edema and hemorrhage.
   Conclusion: No evidence of anaphylactoid or anaphylactic type reactions
   occurred following IM or SC meperidine administration.}},

Title = {{High-Frequency Neel Relaxation Response for Submillimeter Magnetic
   Particle Imaging Under Low Field Gradient}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Modulating the relaxation response of magnetic nanoparticles at two
   distinctive frequencies can be a potential scenario to increase the
   spatial resolution of magnetic particle imaging (MPI), which is
   beneficial for biomedical research applications. Comparatively, standard
   MPI requires a high field gradient to acquire a sharp point-spread
   function to enable submillimeter imaging of magnetic nanotracers
   distributed within cells or small-animal models. However, this strategy
   may face issues in sample handling and signal processing, while
   decreasing the field gradient reduces the spatial resolution and causes
   a blurry image. To improve the MPI image quality, we introduce a
   high-frequency excitation field to temporally encode the Lissajous
   field-free-point trajectory coupled with a low-frequency magnetization
   response under field gradient. Unlike regular MPI, our method further
   decodes the moment relaxation response at narrow side-bands around the
   excitation frequency to obtain the spatial coordinates of magnetic
   nanoparticles within a field of view, instead of the magnetization
   harmonics induced by the driving field. Therefore, the field-free-point
   steering frequencies and the resulting trajectory density are critical
   parameters to adjust the image resolution. Furthermore, a high
   signal-to-noise ratio can be achieved by use of a 1-MHz excitation field
   even with a low amplitude. We also demonstrate two-dimensional image
   reconstruction of a 1-mm ring-shaped solid Resovist (R) sample with
   0.05-mm thickness, as well as other circular and rod phantoms, placed in
   a 1.4 x 1.4 mm(2) field of view under 2 T/m symmetrical field gradient
   on the x-y plane and 4 T/m on the z axis. Although the spatial
   resolution achieved appears low to differentiate two-neighboring
   circular phantoms of dense liquid samples, phase shifting can be further
   used to resolve image distortion due to the low-frequency relaxation
   effects.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives To explore clinical and demographic characteristics impacting
   patient functioning by determining extent of overlap in factors driving
   change in Personal and Social Performance (PSP) and other clinical
   outcomes. Methods Post-hoc analysis from a single-arm trial of
   paliperidone extended release in adult patients with nonacute
   symptomatic schizophrenia. Psychosocial functioning measures: PSP,
   Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S), Positive and Negative
   Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Short-Form 36 (SF-36), treatment satisfaction,
   sleep quality/daytime drowsiness, and Extrapyramidal Symptoms Rating
   Scale. Results Highest correlations with PSP total score change included
   PANSS total score change (Spearman's r = 0.607), PANSS general
   psychopathology change (r = 0.579), and CGI-S change (r = 0.569). A PSP
   score change of -32 predicted 90\% probability of deterioration in CGI-S
   (score change of >= 1). The power of PSP change to predict PANSS total
   score change was lower. Linear stepwise regression demonstrated
   independent relationships for PSP change and: PANSS total change; CGI-S
   change; SF-36 Mental Component change; treatment satisfaction at
   endpoint; PSP at baseline; previous psychiatric hospitalizations. R-2 =
   0.55 meant that 45\% of PSP variation could not be explained by other

Title = {{Beyond Hard and Soft OR: operational research from a software
   engineering perspective}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY}},
Abstract = {{This paper argues that current practice in the Operational Research (OR)
   discipline needs to tackle management problems from a broader point of
   view by including a new perspective. While Hard OR is posed as the means
   to a solution, and Soft OR covers the stakeholder/business perspective,
   this paper proposes OR Engineering to tackle the model/program
   perspective. This proposal is substantiated by an empirical study that
   explored OR history and the rise of ``wicked problems{''} in contrast to
   Software Engineering (SE) history and the idea of ``no silver
   bullet{''}. The main findings are five areas for future works,
   intertwined between Soft OR and OR Engineering: agility, documentation
   of versioning, technical debt, systems testing and architecture.
   Overall, although the goal may be ambitious, this paper aims to
   stimulate reflective thinking and promote a novel and different line of
   action and research among OR and SE practitioners present and future.}},

Title = {{Case Report: Humanized Selective CD19CAR-T Treatment Induces
   MRD-Negative Remission in a Pediatric B-ALL Patient With Primary
   Resistance to Murine-Based CD19CAR-T Therapy}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Background
   CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CD19CAR-T) has shown great
   potential to treat acute B cell lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and B
   cell lymphoma, and most of anti-CD19 scFv are derived from murine
   antibody sequences. However, about 10-20\% of B-ALL patients exhibit
   primary resistance to murine-based CD19CAR-T (CD19mCAR-T). Herein, we
   report that a humanized selective CD19CAR-T (CD19hsCAR-T) may offer a
   solution to this problem.
   Case Description
   A 10-year old boy was diagnosed with high-risk B-ALL in Mar., 2013, and
   relapsed in Oct., 2018, after he underwent haplo-identical hematopoietic
   stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in 2017. The patient then received
   haplo-identical CD19mCAR-T infusions twice following induction
   chemotherapy with Vincristine, Dexamethasone and Asparaginase (VDL), but
   no response was observed. We further treated this patient with
   CD19hsCAR-T following chemotherapy with Vindesine, Idarubicin,
   Dexamethasone, and Pegylated Asparaginase (VDLD) plus bortezomib. The
   patient achieved minimal residual disease-negative (MRDneg) complete
   remission with incomplete hematopoietic recovery (CRi), and remained in
   CRi for more than 8 months with manageable side effect. The patient,
   unfortunately, died of unidentified pulmonary infection on Jan. 25 2020.
   Conclusion
   CD19hsCAR-T may have the potential to induce remission in patients who
   are primarily refractory to CD19mCAR-T.}},

Title = {{LPCAT2 Methylation, a Novel Biomarker for the Severity of Cedar Pollen
   Allergic Rhinitis in Japan}},

Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Recently, the role of the epigenome in allergies has been receiving
   increasing attention. Although several genes that are methylated in
   relation to serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) concentration have been
   reported by epigenome-wide association studies, little is known about
   the DNA methylation sites associated with the symptoms and severity of
   cedar pollinosis (CP).
   Objective
   Our aim was to analyze the association between DNA methylation and the
   symptoms and severity of CP in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
   (PBMCs) and nasal mucosa scraping cells (NMSCs).
   Methods
   We recruited 70 participants during the cedar pollen dispersal season.
   IgE levels were measured by a fluorescence enzyme immunoassay. We
   analyzed DNA methylation of acyl-CoA thioesterase 7 (ACOT7), mucin 4
   (MUC4), schlafen 12 (SLFN12), lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 2
   (LPCAT2), and interleukin-4 (IL4) in PBMCs and NMSCs using bisulfite
   next-generation sequencing; the correlation of DNA methylation with
   non-specific IgE and cedar pollen-specific IgE levels in peripheral
   blood samples was also investigated. Symptom severity and DNA
   methylation were investigated in 15 untreated CP patients.
   Results
   Non-specific IgE levels showed a significant negative correlation with
   average IL4 methylation in PBMCs (r = -0.46, P < 0.0001) but not with
   methylation of ACOT7, MUC4, SLFN12, and LPCAT2. Cedar pollen-specific
   IgE levels showed a significant negative correlation with average IL4
   and MUC4 methylation in PBMCs (r = -0.31, P = 0.01 and r = -0.241, P =
   0.046, respectively) but not with methylation of ACOT7, SLFN12, and
   LPCAT2. The methylation of some genes in NMSCs was not significantly
   correlated with IgE levels. The mean methylation of LPCAT2 in NMSCs
   showed a decreasing trend with increasing severity of CP (P = 0.027).
   Conclusion
   LPCAT2 methylation in NMSCs may reflect the severity of CP and could be
   used as a novel biomarker to identify suitable treatment options for CP.}},

Title = {{Sleep Disturbance Induces Increased Cholesterol Level by NR1D1 Mediated
   CYP7A1 Inhibition}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN GENETICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Disturbed sleep is closely associated with an increased risk of
   metabolic diseases. However, the underlying mechanisms of circadian
   clock genes linking sleep and lipid profile abnormalities have not been
   fully elucidated. This study aimed to explore the important role of the
   circadian clock in regulating impaired cholesterol metabolism at an
   early stage of sleep deprivation (SD). Sleep disturbance was conducted
   using an SD instrument. Our results showed that SD increased the serum
   cholesterol levels. Concentrations of serum leptin and resistin were
   much lower after SD, but other metabolic hormone concentrations
   (adiponectin, glucagon, insulin, thyroxine, norepinephrine, and
   epinephrine) were unchanged before and after SD. Warning signs of
   cardiovascular diseases {[}decreased high density lipoprotein
   (HDL)-cholesterol and increased corticosterone and 8-hydroxyguanosine
   levels] and hepatic cholestasis (elevated total bile acids and bilirubin
   levels) were observed after SD. Cholesterol accumulation was also
   observed in the liver after SD. The expression levels of HMGCR, the
   critical enzyme for cholesterol synthesis, remained unchanged in the
   liver. However, the expression levels of liver CYP7A1, the enzyme
   responsible for the conversion of cholesterol into bile acids,
   significantly reduced after SD. Furthermore, expression of NR1D1, a
   circadian oscillator and transcriptional regulator of CYP7A1, strikingly
   decreased after SD. Moreover, NR1D1 deficiency decreased liver CYP7A1
   levels, and SD could exacerbate the reduction of CYP7A1 expression in
   NR1D1(-/-) mouse livers. Additionally, NR1D1 deficiency could further
   increase serum cholesterol levels under SD. These results suggest that
   sleep disturbance can induce increased serum cholesterol levels and
   liver cholesterol accumulation by NR1D1 mediated CYP7A1 inhibition.}},

Title = {{Use of PROMIS (R) to screen for depression in children with arthritis}},
Journal = {{PEDIATRIC RHEUMATOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Background Children with JIA may experience difficulty with health
   related quality of life (HRQOL). The Patient Reported Outcomes
   Measurement Information System (PROMIS) a patient related outcome (PRO)
   measure, covers HRQOL domains that include physical function, mental
   health, and social interactions. During initial use, we found PROMIS
   identified children with symptoms of depression, sometimes before they
   shared those feelings with parents or members of the clinic team. We
   studied the use of PROMIS for this purpose, and to determine what
   demographic, clinical, and other characteristics might be related to
   higher depressive symptom scores. Methods From March 2014 - February
   2017, at each visit, all JIA patients having met ILAR classification
   criteria seen by M.L.M. received the PROMIS Short Form 35 v.1.0, as part
   of routine care. T scores were calculated from raw scores for mobility,
   anxiety, depressive symptoms, fatigue, peer relationships, and pain
   interference domains. Data extracted by optical mark recognition
   software were merged with electronic medical record (EMR data),
   extracted by Extract/Transform/Load software, including joint counts,
   visit age, ANA, RF, and HLA-B27 status. Mixed effects models were used
   to identify significant associations of independent variables with
   depression T scores. Results Data from 148 patients were analyzed (114
   females for 435 visits, 34 males for 118 visits; 13.8 +/- 2.8 years): 70
   persistent oligoarthritis, 9 extended oligoarthritis, 19 ERA, 21
   polyarthritis (RF-), 5 polyarthritis (RF+), 11 undifferentiated
   arthritis, 3 psoriatic arthritis, 10 systemic arthritis). T scores
   showed wide ranges within individual JIA categories, with similar mean
   scores for all groups. Univariate linear mixed effects models showed
   significant relationships to depression T scores of gender and race
   (males and Asian patients with lower T scores, p < .0001, p = 0.091,
   respectively), joint count (p = 0.002), pain interference score (p =
   0.0004), and Patient and Physician Global Assessment (p = 0.004, p <
   .0001, respectively). No particular JIA category was associated with
   Depression T scores. HRQOL domains were interrelated (p < .0001),
   including patients reporting symptoms of depression tending also to
   report symptoms of anxiety. PROMIS identified 15 patients who did not
   otherwise report depressive symptoms, but needed referral for
   counseling; eight did not endorse depressive symptoms until the 2nd or
   3rd visit. Only 3 patients had disease flare. Concerns besides arthritis
   such as parental conflict or school bullying were elicited in 7 patients
   during interviews with the social worker. All patients expressed being
   worried about their arthritis. Conclusion PROMIS is useful in screening
   JIA patients for symptoms of depression, particularly to identify
   patients who might not otherwise report these symptoms. The other PROMIS
   domain scores are related to reporting of symptoms of depression, as is
   Patient and Physician Global Assessment. Future studies will use PROMIS
   questionnaires incorporated into the EMR, permitting data entry by
   tablets and an online patient portal. This will make possible
   comparisons of HRQOL in children with JIA to those with other chronic
   rheumatic and non-rheumatic diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Ice accretion often poses serious operational and safety challenges in a
   wide range of industries, such as aircraft, wind turbines, power
   transmission cables, oil field exploration and production, as well as
   marine transport. Great efforts have been expended to research and
   develop viable solutions for ice prevention. Effective ice protection
   techniques, however, have yet to be developed. Ice prevention measures
   that are currently available often consume significant amounts of
   de-icing chemicals or energy, and these approaches are expensive to
   operate and have long-term economic and environmental impacts. Here, a
   new ice protective strategy based on thin film surface acoustic waves
   (SAWs) is proposed that generates: nanoscale ``earthquake{''}-like
   vibrations, acoustic streaming, and acousto-heating effects, directly at
   the ice-structure interface, which actively and effectively delays ice
   nucleation and weakens ice adhesion on the structure surface. Compared
   with the conventional electro-thermal de-icing method, the SAW approach
   demonstrates much-improved energy efficiency for ice-removal. The
   potential for the dual capability of autonomous ice monitoring and
   removing functions using the SAW generation elements as transducers is
   also explored.}},

Abstract = {{Background Wingless and Int-related protein (Wnt) ligands are aberrantly
   expressed in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the
   aberrant level of Wnt ligands in serum have not been explored. Here, we
   aimed to identify the levels of WNT4 in serum and explored its oncogenic
   role in CRC. Methods The Oncomine database was used to analyze the
   relationship between WNT4 and the prognosis of CRC. ELISA was performed
   to measure WNT4 levels in serum and conditioned medium from fresh CRC
   tissues and adjacent normal tissues. Western blot and
   immunohistochemistry were carried out to measure the expression of WNT4
   in human CRC tissues and adjacent normal tissues. The migration and
   invasion of CRC cells were determined by trans-well assay, and the
   effects of WNT4 on CRC invasion and metastasis in vivo were verified by
   tumor xenograft in nude mice. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and
   angiogenesis in subcutaneous nodules were detected by immunofluorescence
   (IF). In addition, the suspended spheres formation and tube formation
   assay were performed to explore the effects of WNT4 on CAFs and
   angiogenesis respectively. Results WNT4 was significantly upregulated in
   serum of CRC patients, and CRC tissues were identified as an important
   source of elevated WNT4 levels in CRC patients. Interestingly, elevated
   levels of WNT4 in serum were downregulated after tumor resection.
   Furthermore, we found that WNT4 contributed to epithelial-to-mesenchymal
   transition (EMT) and activated fibroblasts by activating the
   WNT4/beta-catenin pathway in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, angiogenesis
   was induced via the WNT4/beta-catenin/Ang2 pathway. Those effects could
   be reversed by ICG-001, a beta-catenin/TCF inhibitor. Conclusion Our
   findings indicated that serum levels of WNT4 may be a potential
   biomarker for CRC. WNT4 secreted by colorectal cancer tissues promote
   the progression of CRC by inducing EMT, activate fibroblasts and promote
   angiogenesis through the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathway.}},

Title = {{Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Pattern of Cancer Stem Cells in Esophageal
   Cancer}},
Journal = {{TECHNOLOGY IN CANCER RESEARCH \& TREATMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{19}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Background:
   Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are considered the main cause of cancer
   recurrence and metastasis, and DNA methylation is involved in the
   maintenance of CSCs. However, the methylation profile of esophageal CSCs
   remains unknown.
   Methods:
   Side population (SP) cells were isolated from esophageal squamous cell
   carcinoma (ESCC) cell lines KYSE150 and EC109. Sphere-forming cells were
   collected from human primary esophageal cancer cells. SP cells and
   sphere-forming cells were used as substitutes for cancer stem-like
   cells. We investigated the genome-wide DNA methylation profile in
   esophageal cancer stem-like cells using reduced representation bisulfite
   sequencing (RRBS).
   Results:
   Methylated cytosine (mC) was found mostly in CpG dinucleotides, located
   mostly in the intronic, intergenic, and exonic regions. Forty
   intersected differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified in
   these 3 groups of samples. Thirteen differentially methylated genes with
   the same alteration trend were detected; these included OTX1, SPACA1,
   CD163L1, ST8SIA2, TECR, CADM3, GRM1, LRRK1, CHSY1, PROKR2, LINC00658,
   LOC100506688, and NKD2. DMRs covering ST8SIA2 and GRM1 were located in
   exons. These differentially methylated genes were involved in 10
   categories of biological processes and 3 cell signaling pathways.
   Conclusions:
   When compared to non-CSCs, cancer stem-like cells have a differential
   methylation status, which provides an important biological base for
   understanding esophageal CSCs and developing therapeutic targets for
   esophageal cancer.}},

Title = {{Effect of Solution Temperature on Cold Rolling Properties of Lean Duplex
   Stainless Steel}},
Journal = {{STEEL RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The effect of solution temperature on cold rolling properties of lean
   duplex stainless steel (LDSS) was studied. The cold-rolling test was
   used to observe the crack of the material after solution at different
   temperatures; the work hardening curve of the solution treated material
   was obtained by compression test at room temperature, and the austenite
   element in LDSS was calculated by Thermo-Calc software. The different
   element contents obviously affect the stacking fault energy (SFE) of the
   materials, which leads to the change of the difficulty of transformation
   induced martensite in austenite. The phase transformation induced
   plasticity (TRIP) effect in LDSS was analyzed by optical microscopy
   (OM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and electron backscatter
   diffraction (EBSD). It is found that different solution temperature can
   significantly affect the grain size of austenite, and then affect the
   difficulty of strain-induced martensitic transformation (SIMT) of
   austenite grain in LDSS. When solution treated at 900-1100 degrees C,
   with the increase of temperature, the content of quenched martensite
   decreases, the amount of austenite which can induce transformation
   induced plasticity increases, and the rolling performance improve.
   However, when the temperature is higher than 1200 degrees C, Cr2N phase
   precipitates in ferrite, which reduces the plasticity of the material.}},

Title = {{Major ascaroside pheromone component asc-C5 influences reproductive
   plasticity among isolates of the invasive species pinewood nematode}},
Journal = {{INTEGRATIVE ZOOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Pheromones are communication chemicals and regulatory signals used by
   animals and represent unique tools for organisms to mediate behaviors
   and make ``decisions{''} to maximize their fitness. Phenotypic
   plasticity refers to the innate capacity of a species to tolerate a
   greater breadth of environmental conditions across which it adapts to
   improve its survival, reproduction, and fitness. The pinewood nematode,
   Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, an invasive nematode species, was
   accidentally introduced from North America into Japan, China, and
   Europe; however, few studies have investigated its pheromones and
   phenotypic plasticity as a natural model. Here, we demonstrated a novel
   phenomenon, in which nematodes under the condition of pheromone presence
   triggered increased reproduction in invasive strains (JP1, JP2, CN1,
   CN2, EU1, and EU2), while it simultaneously decreased reproduction in
   native strains (US1 and US2). The bidirectional effect on fecundity,
   mediated by presence/absence of pheromones, is henceforth termed
   pheromone-regulative reproductive plasticity (PRRP). We further found
   that synthetic ascaroside asc-C5 (ascr\#9), the major pheromone
   component, plays a leading role in PRRP and identified 2 candidate
   receptor genes, Bxydaf-38 and Bxysrd-10, involved in perceiving asc-C5.
   These results suggest that plasticity of reproductive responses to
   pheromones in pinewood nematode may increase its fitness in novel
   environments following introduction. This opens up a new perspective for
   invasion biology and presents a novel strategy of invasion, suggesting
   that pheromones, in addition to their traditional roles in chemical
   signaling, can influence the reproductive phenotype among native and
   invasive isolates. In addition, this novel mechanism could broadly
   explain, through comparative studies of native and invasive populations
   of animals, a potential underlying factor behind of the success of other
   biological invasions.}},

Abstract = {{The decay Lambda(0)(b) -> eta(c) (1S)pK(- )is observed for the first
   time using a data sample of proton-proton collisions, corresponding to
   an integrated luminosity of 5.5 fb I, collected with the LHCb experiment
   at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The branching fraction of the
   decay is measured, using the Lambda(0)(b) -> J/psi pK(-) decay as a
   normalization mode, to be B(Lambda(0)(b) -> eta(c) (1S)pK(-)) = (1.06
   +/- 0.16 +/- 0.06(-019)(+0.22)) x 10(-4), where the quoted uncertainties
   are statistical, systematic and due to external inputs, respectively. A
   study of the eta(c)(1S)p mass spectrum is performed to search for the
   P-c(4312)(+) pentaquark state. No evidence is B(Lambda(0)(b) ->
   P-c(4312)K-+(-))xB(P-c(4312)(+)-> eta(c)(1S)p)/B(Lambda(0)(b) -> eta(c)
   (1S)pK(-)) < 0.24( ) observed and an upper limit of < 0.24 is obtained
   at the 95\% confidence level.}},

Abstract = {{A relatively less explored plasmonic material, Pd, on the TiO2 interface
   has been utilized to boost the catalytic efficiency of rutile TiO2 as a
   photoelectrocatalyst material. To obtain desired plasmonic behavior, Pd
   ions deposited over TiO2 were reduced under cold/nonthermal hydrogen
   plasma, for complete reduction of as-deposited Pd ions to metallic Pd
   nanoparticles. The Pd@TiO2 photocatalyst, thus prepared, was then
   extensively characterized. We emphasize that this particular catalyst
   can be used as a photoelectrocatalyst, as this is found to exhibit
   promising photoelectrochemical behavior and its ability as a water
   oxidation catalyst in water splitting devices. The enhanced catalytic
   activity achieved by using Pd nanoparticles and subsequent cold hydrogen
   plasma treatment of Pd@TiO2 is expected to make such a system useful for
   many other electrocatalytic and related applications.}},

Journal = {{ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS}},

Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{This article concerns an observability inequality for a system of
   coupled wave equations for the continuous models as well as for the
   space semi-discrete finite difference approximations. For finite
   difference and standard finite elements methods on uniform numerical
   meshes it is known that a numerical pathology produces a blow-up of the
   constant on the observability inequality as the mesh-size h tends to
   zero. We identify this numerical anomaly for coupled wave equations and
   we prove that there exists a uniform observability inequality in a
   subspace of solutions generated by low frequencies. We use the Ingham
   type approach for getting a uniform boundary observability.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: To evaluate the effects of the Navilas system guided by
   optical coherence tomography angiography for advanced macular
   neovascularization (MNV) secondary to age-related macular degeneration
   (AMD). Methods: Prospective case-series including nine eyes presenting
   with advanced MNV with persistence of exudative signs, no longer
   responding to anti-VEGF therapy, best-corrected visual acuity at least
   of 1.3 logMar. All patients were treated with Navilas guided by overlaid
   optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images at the site of
   branching large neovascular trunks. Results: Occlusion of large
   neovascular trunks successfully occurred in all nine included patients.
   OCTA analysis revealed, at 1 month follow up, MNV total area decreasing
   from 6.2 +/- 3.1 to 2.6 +/- 3.4 mm(2). At 6 months follow up, mean MNV
   area was 3.3 +/- 3.4 mm(2) (p = 0.008). Conclusion: This preliminary
   study showed that Navilas treatment guided by OCTA may represent an
   attractive therapeutic option in advanced neovascular lesions secondary

Title = {{The role of dissociation in ketamine's antidepressant effects}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{Ketamine produces immediate antidepressant effects and has inspired
   research into next-generation treatments. Ketamine also has short term
   dissociative effects, in which individuals report altered consciousness
   and perceptions of themselves and their environment. However, whether
   ketamine's dissociative side effects are necessary for its
   antidepressant effects remains unclear. This perspective examines the
   relationship between dissociative effects and acute and longer-lasting
   antidepressant response to ketamine and other N-methyl-D-aspartate
   (NMDA) receptor antagonists. Presently, the literature does not support
   the conclusion that dissociation is necessary for antidepressant
   response to ketamine. However, further work is needed to explore the
   relationship between dissociation and antidepressant response at the
   molecular, biomarker, and psychological levels. Ketamine is associated
   with rapid antidepressant effects and temporary dissociative
   experiences, and this review examines whether these dissociative
   symptoms are necessary for antidepressant efficacy. Although the current
   literature does not support this relationship, further work is needed to
   explore possible associations at the molecular, biomarker, and
   psychological levels.}},

Abstract = {{Primary CNS tumors are the leading cause of cancer-related death in
   pediatrics. It is essential to understand treatment trends to interpret
   national survival data. In Canada, children with CNS tumors are treated
   at one of 16 tertiary care centers. We surveyed pediatric
   neuro-oncologists to create a national standard of practice to be used
   in the absence of a clinical trial for seven of the most prevalent brain
   tumors in children. This allowed description of practice across the
   country, along with a consensus. This had a multitude of benefits,
   including understanding practice patterns, allowing for a basis to
   compare in future research and informing Health Canada of the current
   management of patients. This also allows all children in Canada to
   receive equivalent care, regardless of location.}},

Title = {{Facilitated Stories for Change: Digital Storytelling as a Tool for
   Engagement in Facilitated Discussion for Reduction of Diabetes-Related
   Health Disparities Among Rural Latino Patients With Diabetes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSCULTURAL NURSING}},
Abstract = {{Introduction
   Latino populations, particularly those living in rural areas, experience
   a disproportionately high prevalence and poorer outcomes of type 2
   diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The purpose of this study was to test the
   acceptability and perceived effectiveness of a group-based, facilitated
   digital storytelling intervention for T2DM self-management among rural
   Latino patients.
   Method
   Twenty Latino adults with T2DM participated in facilitated storytelling
   discussions at two primary clinics. Participants viewed a 12-minute T2DM
   self-management digital storytelling intervention, followed by a
   facilitated group discussion. Surveys, observations, and focus groups
   were used to assess for acceptability and perceived effectiveness of the
   intervention through descriptive and qualitative analysis, informed by
   narrative and social cognitive theory.
   Results
   All participants found the intervention interesting and useful and
   reported improvement in confidence, motivation, and behavioral
   intentions for T2DM self-management. Themes mapped closely with
   narrative theory models, further suggestive of the behavior change
   potential.
   Discussion
   Facilitated discussions may add value to viewing of digital stories and
   represent a scalable approach to provide culturally congruent health
   care for Latino patients with diabetes in rural settings. Within the
   paradigm of group-based diabetes educational programs, this lends itself
   well to critical transcultural nursing care.}},

Title = {{Investigation of PolyVinyl Chloride Plastisol Tissue-Mimicking Phantoms
   for MR- and Ultrasound-Elastography}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Realistic tissue-mimicking phantoms are essential for the
   development, the investigation and the calibration of medical imaging
   techniques and protocols. Because it requires taking both mechanical and
   imaging properties into account, the development of robust, calibrated
   phantoms is a major challenge in elastography. Soft polyvinyl chloride
   gels in a liquid plasticizer (plastisol or PVCP) have been proposed as
   soft tissue-mimicking phantoms (TMP) for elasticity imaging. PVCP
   phantoms are relatively low-cost and can be easily stored over long time
   periods without any specific requirements. In this work, the preparation
   of a PVCP gel phantom for both MR and ultrasound-elastography is
   proposed and its acoustic, NMR and mechanical properties are studied.
   Materials and methods: The acoustic and magnetic resonance imaging
   properties of PVCP are measured for different mass ratios between
   ultrasound speckle particles and PVCP solution, and between resin and
   plasticizer. The linear mechanical properties of plastisol samples are
   then investigated over time using not only indentation tests, but also
   MR and ultrasound-elastography clinical protocols. These properties are
   compared to typical values reported for biological soft tissues and to
   the values found in the literature for PVCP gels.
   Results and conclusions: After a period of two weeks, the mechanical
   properties of the plastisol samples measured with indentation testing
   are stable for at least the following 4 weeks (end of follow-up period
   43 days after gelation-fusion). Neither the mechanical nor the NMR
   properties of plastisol gels were found to be affected by the addition
   of cellulose as acoustic speckle. Mechanical properties of the proposed
   gels were successfully characterized by clinical, commercially-available
   MR Elastography and sonoelastography protocols. PVCP with a mass ratio
   of ultrasound speckle particles of 0.6\%-0.8\% and a mass ratio between
   resin and plasticizer between 50 and 70\% appears as a good TMP
   candidate that can be used with both MR and ultrasound-based
   elastography methods.}},

Abstract = {{In plant cells, cortical microtubules (CMTs) generally control
   morphogenesis by guiding cellulose synthesis. CMT alignment has been
   proposed to depend on geometrical cues, with microtubules aligning with
   the cell long axis in silico and in vitro. Yet, CMTs are usually
   transverse in vivo, i.e., along predicted maximal tension, which is
   transverse for cylindrical pressurized vessels. Here, we adapted a
   microwell setup to test these predictions in a single-cell system. We
   confined protoplasts laterally to impose a curvature ratio and modulated
   pressurization through osmotic changes. We find that CMTs can be
   longitudinal or transverse in wallless protoplasts and that the switch
   in CMT orientation depends on pressurization. In particular,
   longitudinal CMTs become transverse when cortical tension increases.
   This explains the dual behavior of CMTs in planta: CMTs become
   longitudinal when stress levels become low, while stable transverse CMT
   alignments in tissues result from their autonomous response to tensile
   stress fluctuations.}},

Abstract = {{Anaerobic conditions developed in soils with flooding can enhance the
   release of soil P to overlying water, but little information is
   available for soils with a long history of manure application. We
   examined the P release from manure-amended soils under simulated
   snowmelt flooding. Intact monoliths from manured (solid swine manure
   {[}SSM] or liquid swine manure {[}LSM]) and unamended (control) field
   plots were collected from Carman, Manitoba. Monoliths were frozen for 7
   d, thawed, flooded, and incubated at 4 +/- 1 degrees C. Redox potential,
   pH, and concentrations of dissolved reactive P (DRP), Ca, Mg, Fe, and Mn
   in pore water and floodwater were determined weekly up to 56 d after
   flooding (DAF) and at 84 DAF. Redox potential decreased with DAF with a
   greater and more rapid decrease in SSM (from similar to 300 to <0 mV by
   84 DAF) compared with LSM and control (similar to 100 mV by 84 DAF).
   Pore water and floodwater DRP concentrations were significantly greater
   in manured treatments than in the control at all DAFs and in SSM than in
   LSM for most DAF. Whereas floodwater DRP concentrations remained
   relatively stable in the control treatment, concentrations in manured
   treatments increased substantially from the onset of flooding to 35-42
   DAF (threefold to fourfold increase) and remained relatively stable
   thereafter. Significantly greater P release from SSM- than from
   LSM-treated monoliths was due to greater input of P and the higher
   organic matter content in SSM-treated soils. These favored the rapid
   development of anaerobic conditions that further induced P release.}},

Abstract = {{Micro- and nanolasers are miniaturized light sources with great
   potential in optical imaging, sensing, and communication. While various
   micro- and nanolasers have been synthesized, they are mostly linearly
   polarized and thus strongly restricted in many new applications, e.g.,
   chiral resolution in synthetic chemistry, cancerous tissue imaging,
   information storage, and processing. Herein, we experimentally
   demonstrate the circularly polarized surface emitting perovskite lasers
   by integrating the as-grown perovskite microcrystals with an
   all-dielectric metalens. The perovskite microcrystal serves as an
   optical microcavity and produces linearly polarized laser emission,
   which is collected by a geometric phase based TiO2 metalens. The
   left-handed circularly polarized components are collimated by the
   metalens into a directional laser beam with a divergent angle of <0.9
   degrees, whereas the right-handed components are strongly diverged by
   the same metalens. Consequently, the right-handed circularly polarized
   components are filtered out, and perovskite lasers with high
   directionality and pure circular polarization have been experimentally
   realized.}},

Abstract = {{This research complements previous studies in which color contrast
   between ridges and furrows of latent fingermarks was investigated as a
   potential aging parameter. In this case, the robustness of the technique
   has been tested by including five female and five male donors who
   deposited sebaceous-rich latent fingermarks onto ceramic tile and
   polystyrene plastic as well as flat and rolled inked fingerprints on
   commercially available ten-print cards. Fresh latent fingermarks were
   visualized with either carbon black or titanium dioxide powder (TiO2)
   and inked fingerprints were imprinted in succession without re-charging
   ink. The mean intensity (MI) and intensity amplitude (IA) metrics of the
   color histogram were collected from each image for statistical analyses.
   The goals were to detect any differences within and between the
   analysts' own interpretation of the protocol as well as examine how
   color contrast may be influenced by donor, substrate, biological sex,
   powder type, and the quantity of ink deposited. Results show that the
   color contrast metrics (MI and IA) are repeatable and reproducible and
   not affected significantly by donor, sex, deposition pressure, or
   distortion. However, the metrics were sufficiently sensitive to
   distinguish substrate and powder types and to detect different
   quantities of ink. The statistical analyses confirm and expand upon
   previous observations regarding the reliability of MI and IA as metrics
   that could eventually be used to estimate the age of a latent
   fingermark. At the same time, it was revealed that the technique needs
   further improvement and standardization by including a universal ``white
   color standard{''} to conduct image comparisons.}},

Abstract = {{We aimed to explore autobiographical memory for repeated events. For

   the vacation scripts they have in mind. The last instances were expected
   to be highest in script consistency whereas the first instances would be
   the lowest due to duration between encoding and retrieval in addition to
   the frequency of potential script updates. We predicted that random
   instances selected freely by the participants would display high
   script-consistency due to ease of access. Finally, distinct instances
   would vary in their script consistency to the extent that they deviate
   from a script-consistent vacation experience. Overall, results were in

Abstract = {{Effective and efficient forecasting relies on identification of the

   features-and isolating it from the rest. When the future of a process
   bears a strong dependence on its behavior far into the past, there are
   many such features to store, necessitating complex models with extensive
   memories. Here, we highlight a family of stochastic processes whose
   minimal classical models must devote unboundedly many bits to tracking
   the past. For this family, we identify quantum models of equal accuracy
   that can store all relevant information within a single two-dimensional
   quantum system (qubit). This represents the ultimate limit of quantum
   compression and highlights an immense practical advantage of quantum
   technologies for the forecasting and simulation of complex systems.}},

Title = {{Days Spent at Home before Death from Cancer for Immigrants and Long-Term

Abstract = {{Background: Time at home before death is an emerging patient-centered
   metric of quality end-of-life care. It is unknown if immigrants who die
   from cancer in Ontario spend less time at home near the end of life.
   Objective: Compare the number of days at home (DAH) in the last six
   months of life for immigrants and long-term residents (LTRs) who die
   from cancer.
   Methods: Population-based cohort study (January 1, 2005 to December 31,
   2013) using administrative databases. Participants were adults (>= 18
   years) who died from cancer in Ontario. Immigrants were defined as those
   who immigrated from 1985 onward. The outcome was DAH in the last six
   months of life. Analysis included univariate and multivariable
   regression, adjusting for patient and disease characteristics. Subgroup
   analyses assessed DAH by immigration class, time since immigration, and
   region of birth. Sensitivity analyses excluded patients with breast and
   prostate cancer to examine for sex differences.
   Results: Seventy-two thousand nine hundred eighty-eight individuals
   (3988 immigrants) were identified. Immigrants spent fewer DAH in the
   last six months (unadjusted 162 days vs. 164 days, p < 0.001). This
   remained statistically significant after adjusting (p = 0.0087). DAH
   varied by immigration class and region of birth. Sensitivity analyses
   suggest a sex difference in end-of-life time spent at home.
   Conclusions: Immigrants who die from cancer in Ontario spend fewer DAH

Journal = {{ELIFE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{Using a contingency volatility manipulation, we tested the hypothesis
   that difficulty adapting probabilistic decision-making to second-order
   uncertainty might reflect a core deficit that cuts across anxiety and
   depression and holds regardless of whether outcomes are aversive or
   involve reward gain or loss. We used bifactor modeling of internalizing
   symptoms to separate symptom variance common to both anxiety and
   depression from that unique to each. Across two experiments, we modeled
   performance on a probabilistic decision-making under volatility task
   using a hierarchical Bayesian framework. Elevated scores on the common
   internalizing factor, with high loadings across anxiety and depression
   items, were linked to impoverished adjustment of learning to volatility
   regardless of whether outcomes involved reward gain, electrical
   stimulation, or reward loss. In particular, high common factor scores
   were linked to dampened learning following better-than-expected outcomes
   in volatile environments. No such relationships were observed for
   anxiety- or depression-specific symptom factors.}},

Abstract = {{Maishe Maponya is regarded as one of the pre-eminent, militant and
   critical voices of South African theatre. He was not only active in the
   black people's struggle but also a committed playwright. To him,
   identity and belonging were inseparable in his quest for total
   liberation of the black people. Even commentators who often viewed his
   work as too radical and less creative could not silence the voice of the
   masses in his productions. Importantly, his productions not only spoke
   against the oppression of the black people, but also survived the
   draconian laws of the apartheid era. As Silber noted in 1984, Maponya
   and his group used the theatre of the struggle to conscientise their
   audiences about the socioeconomic conditions of their people. This
   article explores how Maponya used theatre to subvert the state and echo
   the travails of black people during apartheid in one of his plays, The
   Hungry Earth (1980). This article argues that the play is based on the
   people and their struggles - a clear indication that Maponya consciously
   articulated the hopes, dreams and frustrations of the people. The
   article also acknowledges the influence of Biko's Black Consciousness
   Movement (BCM) on Maponya's unflinching `call to cultural arms' against
   apartheid, regardless of the lurking dangers.}},

Title = {{Atomic Raman scattering: Third-order diffraction in a double geometry}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{In a retroreflective scheme with an atom initially at rest, atomic Raman
   diffraction adopts some of the properties of Bragg diffraction due to
   additional couplings to off-resonant momenta. As a consequence, double
   Raman diffraction has to be performed in a Bragg-type regime, where the
   pulse duration is sufficiently long to suppress diffraction into
   spurious orders Taking advantage of this regime, double Raman allows for
   resonant higher-order diffraction. We study theoretically the case of
   third-order diffraction and compare it to first order as well as a
   sequence of first-order Raman pulses giving rise to the same momentum
   transfer as the third-order pulse. Moreover, we demonstrate that
   interferometry is possible, and we investigate amplitude and contrast of
   a third-order double Raman Mach-Zehnder interferometer. In fact,
   third-order diffraction constitutes a competitive tool for the
   diffraction of ultracold atoms and interferometry based on large
   momentum transfer since it allows one to reduce the complexity of the
   experiment as well as the total duration of the diffraction process
   compared to a sequence, at the cost of higher pulse intensities.}},

Abstract = {{Research on collaborative learning has revealed that peer-collaboration
   explanation activities facilitate reflection and metacognition and that
   establishing common ground and successful coordination are keys to
   realizing effective knowledge-sharing in collaborative learning tasks.
   Studies on computer-supported collaborative learning have investigated
   how awareness tools can facilitate coordination within a group and how
   the use of external facilitation scripts can elicit elaborated knowledge
   during collaboration. However, the separate and joint effects of these
   tools on the nature of the collaborative process and performance have
   rarely been investigated. This study investigates how two facilitation
   methods-coordination support via learner gaze-awareness feedback and
   metacognitive suggestion provision via a pedagogical conversational
   agent (PCA)-are able to enhance the learning process and learning gains.
   Eighty participants, organized into dyads, were enrolled in a 2 x 2
   between-subject study. The first and second factors were the presence of
   real-time gaze feedback (no vs. visible gaze) and that of a
   suggestion-providing PCA (no vs. visible agent), respectively. Two
   evaluation methods were used: namely, dialog analysis of the
   collaborative process and evaluation of learning gains. The real-time
   gaze feedback and PCA suggestions facilitated the coordination process,
   while gaze was relatively more effective in improving the learning
   gains. Learners in the Gaze-feedback condition achieved superior
   learning gains upon receiving PCA suggestions. A successful
   coordination/high learning performance correlation was noted solely for
   learners receiving visible gaze feedback and PCA suggestions
   simultaneously (visible gaze/visible agent). This finding has the
   potential to yield improved collaborative processes and learning gains
   through integration of these two methods as well as contributing towards
   design principles for collaborative-learning support systems more
   generally.}},

Abstract = {{The group IIF iron meteorites and Eagle Station pallasites (PES) have
   highly siderophile element abundances (HSE; Re, Os, Ir, Ru, Pt, and Pd)
   of metal that are consistent with formation in planetesimal cores by
   fractional crystallization with minor to major solid metal-liquid metal
   mixing. Modeling of HSE abundances of the IIF irons indicates a complex
   formation history that included the mixing of primitive and evolved
   solid and liquid metals. By contrast, modeling of HSE abundances of PES
   metal suggests these meteorites formed mainly as equilibrium solids from
   a common liquid. Abundances of some of the siderophile elements in the
   IIF irons and PES are permissive of a common core origin; however, the
   abundances of W and Ni indicate the PES ultimately formed on a more
   oxidized body. The PES most likely formed by the injection of olivine
   present at the core-mantle boundary into a metallic core liquid as a
   result of impact. The core then crystallized inward, trapping the
   olivine.}},

Abstract = {{The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
   coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has spread worldwide, with millions of
   cases and more than 1 million deaths to date. The gravity of the
   situation mandates accelerated efforts to identify safe and effective
   vaccines. Here, we generated measles virus (MeV)-based vaccine
   candidates expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S). Insertion
   of the full-length S protein gene in two different MeV genomic positions
   resulted in modulated S protein expression. The variant with lower S
   protein expression levels was genetically stable and induced high levels
   of effective Th1-biased antibody and T cell responses in mice after two
   immunizations. In addition to neutralizing IgG antibody responses in a
   protective range, multifunctional CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cell responses
   with S protein-specific killing activity were detected. Upon challenge
   using a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2, virus loads in vaccinated mice were
   significantly lower, while vaccinated Syrian hamsters revealed
   protection in a harsh challenge setup using an early-passage human
   patient isolate. These results are highly encouraging and support
   further development of MeV-based COVID-19 vaccines.}},

Abstract = {{In addition to the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR), the dopamine D-2
   receptor (D2R) is a key therapeutic target of antipsychotics for the
   treatment of schizophrenia. The inactive state structures of D2R have
   been described in complex with the inverse agonists risperidone (D2Rris)
   and haloperidol (D2Rhal). Here we describe the structure of human D2R in
   complex with spiperone (D2Rspi). In D2Rspi, the conformation of the
   extracellular loop (ECL) 2, which composes the ligand-binding pocket,
   was substantially different from those in D2Rris and D2Rhal,
   demonstrating that ECL2 in D2R is highly dynamic. Moreover, D2Rspi
   exhibited an extended binding pocket to accommodate spiperone's phenyl
   ring, which probably contributes to the selectivity of spiperone to D2R
   and 5-HT2AR. Together with D2Rris and D2Rhal, the structural information
   of D2Rspi should be of value for designing novel antipsychotics with
   improved safety and efficacy. The dopamine D-2 receptor (D2R) is a GPCR
   and an important drug target for schizophrenia treatment. Here, the
   authors present the crystal structure of human D2R in complex with the
   antipsychotic drug spiperone, which is of interest for designing
   antipsychotics with improved receptor selectivity.}},

Title = {{Financial leverage and corporate innovation in Chinese public-listed
   firms}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose This study attempts to document the impact of financial leverage
   on corporate innovation in the Chinese nonfinancial public firms listed
   on Shenzhen and Shanghai stock exchanges. Design/methodology/approach
   The firm-level data are collected from CSMAR database for ten years,
   ranging from 2007 to 2016. The authors have employed the panel fixed
   effects model and further system GMM approach for analysis. The sample
   is segregated on the basis of state (SOE) and nonstate ownership (NSOE)
   to check for the diverse effects. In total, three different proxies of
   financial leverage are used to unearth the varying impact of short-time
   and long-term leverage separately. Further, corporate innovation is
   divided into input innovation (R\&D/Sales and R\&D/Assets) and output
   innovation (patents and inventions). Findings The results suggest that
   financial leverage is detrimental to the input innovation while
   conducive for the output innovation when measured by the number of
   patents. Contrarily, leverage has a negative influence over the output
   innovation when measured by the number of inventions. This implies that
   leverage is more damaging for the highest form of innovativeness
   (inventions) in China. Input innovation is more sensitive to the changes
   in long-term leverage versus short-term leverage. Further, the authors
   find that innovation in SOEs is more sensitive to the changes in the
   leverage as compared to the NSOEs. The results are free from the threat
   of endogeneity and identification problems, as reported by the system
   GMM model. Research limitations/implications The authors did not
   segregate the sample on the basis of industry/sector. Practical
   implications The firms pursuing a strategy of radical innovation should
   try to keep their debt levels lower in order to achieve a higher
   innovation performance. Although, a rise in the leverage may mean an
   increased access to finance for a firm but such an access comes at a
   cost in the form of damage to the corporate innovation. However,
   increased debt financing may not be so bad for the firms that want to
   achieve a moderate and not the highest level of innovation. Such firms
   can produce recurring and synergic effects with debt financing and
   moderate innovation, once they achieve a level of innovation performance
   that satisfies their financiers. Originality/value To the best of
   authors' knowledge, this is probably the first study to check the impact
   of firm-level financial leverage on both input and output innovation in
   the Chinese public-listed nonfinancial firms' panel data perspective
   till now.}},

Abstract = {{The netrin-1/DCC ligand/receptor pair has key roles in central nervous
   system (CNS) development, mediating axonal, and neuronal navigation.
   Although expression of netrin-1 and DCC is maintained in the adult
   brain, little is known about their role in mature neurons. Notably,
   netrin-1 is highly expressed in the adult substantia nigra, leading us
   to investigate a role of the netrin-1/DCC pair in adult nigral neuron
   fate. Here, we show that silencing netrin-1 in the adult substantia
   nigra of mice induces DCC cleavage and a significant loss of dopamine
   neurons, resulting in motor deficits. Because loss of adult dopamine
   neurons and motor impairments are features of Parkinson's disease (PD),
   we studied the potential impact of netrin-1 in different animal models
   of PD. We demonstrate that both overexpression of netrin-1 and brain
   administration of recombinant netrin-1 are neuroprotective and
   neurorestorative in mouse and rat models of PD. Of interest, we observed
   that netrin-1 levels are significantly reduced in PD patient brain
   samples. These results highlight the key role of netrin-1 in adult
   dopamine neuron fate, and the therapeutic potential of targeting
   netrin-1 signaling in PD.}},

   primarily has been focused on reactive power planning (RPP) through

   components viz. cost due to real power loss, VAr generation cost,
   additional VAr compensation devices cost and line charging cost. FACTS
   (flexible AC transmission system) devices are installed at weak
   positions through different echelons to improve the system voltage
   stability. The authors also implemented the probabilistic hybridisation
   of crow search algorithm and JAYA to find out the optimal set of
   controlling parameters related to VAr. Finally, a sharp and minute
   analysis of the results has been done to validate the proposed strategy
   under multi-loading conditions. To understand the efficiency and
   efficacy the code profiling and simulation has been rendered on IEEE 30

   (CTKUB) scan extent protocol compliance and associated doses in the
   Emergency Department (ED) of an Australian tertiary hospital. Methods: A
   retrospective clinical audit of 150 consecutive ED CTKUB cases was
   completed. For each patient, scan extent compliance at the superior
   (kidneys) and inferior (pubic symphysis) borders, in reference to the
   protocol was recorded. Compliance and non-compliance
   (over-/under-scanning) was identified, described (superior/inferior),
   quantified (via IMPAX measurements) and recorded via a purpose-built
   audit tool. In addition, a PBU40 phantom was scanned to assess the
   percentage of dose (DLP) increase per centimetre of over-scanning to
   contextualise results. Results: A notable non-compliance with department
   protocol was noted. Eight cases (5.3\%) demonstrated overall CT scan
   extent compliance. The remaining 142 cases (94.7\%) demonstrated some
   form of non-compliance; superiorly, inferiorly or both. Analysing the
   150 superior and 150 inferior data points independently, the most common
   non-compliance was over-scanning at the kidneys by 4 cm to5 cm (19
   cases, similar to 10\% extra DLP) beyond tolerance and over-scanning
   inferiorly at the pubic symphysis by 1 cm to 2 cm (29 cases, similar to
   6.4\% extra DLP). Estimated dose increases of up to 35\% to 45\% were
   found when clinical audit results were simulated using a PBU40.
   Conclusions: Over-scanning is a predominant occurrence in CTKUB scans in
   this department. Reasons for over-scanning weren't investigated. It's
   anticipated this audit will lead to greater awareness of scan extent
   compliance and dose ramifications of non-compliance. The usage of more
   easily identified anatomical landmarks and a follow-up audit is
   suggested.}},

Abstract = {{Low-dimensional charge density wave (CDW) systems, which undergo
   successive so-called Peierls phase transitions at characteristic
   temperatures associated with corresponding changes in electronic
   structure, are of great importance for exploring novel quantum physics.
   Here, we report systematic research of the magneto-transport properties
   for the quasi-two-dimensional CDW conductor eta-Mo4O11 under high
   magnetic fields up to 59 T. Measurements of in-plane and out-of-plane
   magneto-resistance and Hall resistance have been carried out to
   determine the Fermi surface (FS) structure at low temperatures and high
   magnetic fields. Beyond the quantum limit (QL), fast quantum
   oscillations (QOs) with complex periods have been found in both MR and
   Hall resistance, representing a direct measurement of the area of the
   FS. In addition, we observe a conspicuous phase transition at 45 T. The
   QO frequency and carrier density successively increase above the QL and
   phase transition fields. Consequently, we propose that such remarkable
   feature of the magnetic field dependence of the fast QOs for
   eta-Mo(4)O(11 )arises from the field-induced density wave transition and
   FS reconstruction. We have further discussed the mechanism and provided
   the evolution on the geometry of the FS with magnetic field in the
   second CDW state based on the field-dependent FS model.}},

Abstract = {{Marine bacteria employ various strategies to maintain their competitive
   advantage over others in a mixed community. The use of Type VI Secretion
   Systems (T6SS), a protein secretion apparatus used as a molecular weapon
   for interbacterial competition and eukaryotic interactions, is one of
   the competitive strategies that is least studied among heterotrophic
   bacteria living in the water column. To get an insight into the temporal
   and spatial distribution of bacteria with T6SS in this portion of the
   marine environment, we examine the presence and abundance of
   T6SS-bearing bacteria at both local and global scales through the use of
   metagenome data from water samples obtained from the coast of Monterey
   Bay and the TARA Oceans project. We also track the abundance of
   T6SS-harboring bacteria through a two-year time series of weekly water
   samples in the same coastal site to examine the environmental factors
   that may drive their presence and abundance. Among the twenty-one
   T6SS-bearing bacterial genera examined, we found several genera assume a
   particle-attached lifestyle, with only a few genera having a free-living
   lifestyle. The abundance of T6SS-harboring bacteria in both niches
   negatively correlates with the abundance of autotrophs. Globally, we
   found that T6SS genes are much more abundant in areas with low
   biological productivity. Our data suggest that T6SS-harboring bacteria
   tend to be abundant spatially and temporally when organic resources are
   limited. This ecological study agrees with the patterns observed from
   several in vitro studies; that T6SS could be an adaptive strategy
   employed by heterotrophic bacteria to obtain nutrients or reduce
   competition when resources are in limited quantity.}},

Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{30}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Aim An increase in conifer mortality has been observed widely across the
   boreal forest biome. We investigate the causes of this mortality, in
   addition to the geospatial and temporal dynamics of mortality, in
   Siberian pine and fir stands.
   Location Central Siberia.
   Time period 1950-2018.
   Major taxa studied Pinus sibirica Du Tour and Abies sibirica Ledeb.
   Methods We used geospatial analysis of satellite-derived (MODIS,
   Landsat) data, topography (elevation, slope steepness and exposure) and
   climatic variables {[}precipitation, thermal degree days (TDD = n-ary
   sumation (t > 0 degrees C), standardized precipitation
   evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and root zone moisture content (RZM)],
   together with in situ data. Dendrochronology was applied for analysis of
   the radial growth increment (GI).
   Results Siberian pine and fir mortality has increased greatly in recent
   decades. The mortality of forest stands and trees was dependent on the
   TDD, RZM and SPEI. Mortality occurred mainly within the southern part of
   the species ranges and decreased northward, correlated with latitudinal
   gradients of TDD and SPEI. Mortality was observed mostly at elevations <
   1,000 m and decreased with increasing elevation, whereas the area of
   forests and GI of trees increased with elevation. Forest mortality was
   preceded by the changes in tree GI. Since the onset of climate warming,
   GI increased until a breakpoint in the mid-1980s. Further temperature
   increase caused a reduction in GI owing to moisture stress and division
   of the tree population into ``decliners{''} and ``survivors{''}.
   Mortality was caused by the combined impact of moisture stress and bark
   beetle attacks.
   Main conclusion Siberian pine and fir mortality was preceded by a
   reduction in the GI of trees caused by elevated air temperatures, acute
   droughts and subsequent insect attacks. Forest mortality was observed
   mostly at low elevations, whereas within the areas with sufficient
   moisture availability (at elevations c. < 1,000 m) the tree GI and
   forest area increased. With the projected increase in drought, Siberian
   pine and fir trees are predicted to retreat from their southern
   low-elevation ranges.}},

Abstract = {{CLC-2 is a voltage-gated chloride channel that is widely expressed in
   mammalian tissues. In the central nervous system, CLC-2 appears in
   neurons and glia. Studies to define how this channel contributes to
   normal and pathophysiological function in the central nervous system
   raise questions that remain unresolved, in part due to the absence of
   precise pharmacological tools for modulating CLC-2 activity. Herein, we
   describe the development and optimization of AK-42, a specific
   small-molecule inhibitor of CLC-2 with nanomolar potency (IC50 = 17 +/-
   1 nM). AK-42 displays unprecedented selectivity (>1,000-fold) over
   CLC-1, the closest CLC-2 homolog, and exhibits no off-target engagement
   against a panel of 61 common channels, receptors, and transporters
   expressed in brain tissue. Computational docking, validated by
   mutagenesis and kinetic studies, indicates that AK-42 binds to an
   extracellular vestibule above the channel pore. In electrophysiological
   recordings of mouse CA1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons, AK-42 acutely and
   reversibly inhibits CLC-2 currents; no effect on current is observed on
   brain slices taken from CLC-2 knockout mice. These results establish
   AK-42 as a powerful tool for investigating CLC-2 neurophysiology.}},

Abstract = {{Chemically defined vectors such as cationic polymers are versatile
   alternatives to engineered viruses for the delivery of genome-editing
   payloads. However, their clinical translation hinges on rapidly
   exploring vast chemical design spaces and deriving structure-function
   relationships governing delivery performance. Here, we discovered a
   polymer for efficient intracellular ribonucleoprotein (RNP) delivery
   through combinatorial polymer design and parallelized experimental
   workflows. A chemically diverse library of 43 statistical copolymers was
   synthesized via combinatorial RAFT polymerization, realizing systematic
   variations in physicochemical properties. We selected cationic monomers
   that varied in their pK(a) values (8.1-9.2), steric bulk, and
   lipophilicity of their alkyl substituents. Co-monomers of varying
   hydrophilicity were also incorporated, enabling elucidation of the roles
   of protonation equilibria and hydrophobic-hydrophilic balance in
   vehicular properties and performance. We screened our multiparametric
   vector library through image cytometry and rapidly uncovered a hit
   polymer (P38), which outperforms state-of-the-art commercial
   transfection reagents, achieving nearly 60\% editing efficiency via
   nonhomologous end-joining. Structure-function correlations underlying
   editing efficiency, cellular toxicity, and RNP uptake were probed
   through machine learning approaches to uncover the physicochemical basis
   of P38's performance. Although cellular toxicity and RNP uptake were
   solely determined by polyplex size distribution and protonation degree,
   respectively, these two polyplex design parameters were found to be
   inconsequential for enhancing editing efficiency. Instead, polymer
   hydrophobicity and the Hill coefficient, a parameter describing
   cooperativity-enhanced polymer deprotonation, were identified as the
   critical determinants of editing efficiency. Combinatorial synthesis and
   high-throughput characterization methodologies coupled with data science
   approaches enabled the rapid discovery of a polymeric vehicle that would
   have otherwise remained inaccessible to chemical intuition. The
   statistically derived design rules elucidated herein will guide the
   synthesis and optimization of future polymer libraries tailored for
   therapeutic applications of RNP-based genome editing.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction To explore whether Skog's theory of collectivity of
   drinking cultures is valid across groups with different socioeconomic
   position (SEP).
   Methods Individual-level information on alcohol consumption and SEP for
   the years 2004-2014 were retrieved from the Monitoring Project; a
   nationally representative monthly alcohol use survey. The analytical
   sample consisted of 162 369 respondents aged 25-79 years. SEP was
   measured by education level. Alcohol use was measured by yearly volume
   of consumption and frequency of heavy episodic drinking (HED).
   Respondents were divided into six SEP-groups based on their education
   level and sex. Mean yearly volume consumption and prevalence of monthly
   HED was calculated for each group and graphically plotted against the
   overall mean volume of consumption.
   Results The yearly changes in overall mean consumption during the study
   period reflected a collective shift in drinking across groups with
   basic, intermediate and high education. There were also indications that
   changes in overall mean consumption reflected collective shifts in the
   prevalence of HED across the SEP-groups. Moreover, while the magnitude
   of the associations for both average volume and HED differed somewhat in
   strength across the SEP-groups, they were clearly in the same, positive,
   direction.
   Discussion and Conclusions Our findings add support for including a
   socioeconomic dimension to Skog's theory of collectivity of drinking
   cultures. Future studies should replicate our analyses on cases and
   periods with more tangible changes in the price and availability of
   alcohol.}},

Title = {{The error-related negativity as a neuromarker of risk or resilience in
   young children}},
Journal = {{BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Introduction The error-related negativity (ERN) is a neural response
   that reflects error monitoring. Contradictorily, an enlarged (more
   negative) ERN has been cited as both a risk factor and a protective
   factor, which hinders its utility as a predictive indicator. The aim of
   the current study was to examine the associations between ERN measured
   in early childhood with the development of cognitive control (CC),
   emotion regulation, and internalizing/externalizing symptoms over 1-2
   years.
   Methods When children were ages 5-7, EEG was collected during a Go/No-Go
   task. A subset of the original participants (n = 30) were selected based
   on their baseline ERN in an extreme-case design: half with
   high-amplitude ERN, matched by age and sex with another group with
   low-amplitude ERN.
   Results At follow-up, children in the High-Amplitude group showed better
   executive function, less self-reported anxiety and depression, less
   affect dysregulation, more parent-rated CC, less lability/negativity,
   and fewer parent-reported externalizing problems. Many results held even
   when accounting for baseline levels. Further, emotion dysregulation
   mediated the relationship between the ERN and both anxiety and
   externalizing problems, while CC mediated the ERN's relationship with
   externalizing problems only.
   Conclusions These results can inform identification and intervention
   efforts for children at risk for psychopathology.}},

Abstract = {{The composition of organic compounds in marine aerosols and the relative
   contributions of primary and secondary organic compounds remain
   uncertain. We report results from a novel approach to characterize and
   quantify organic components of the marine aerosol. Size-segregated
   discrete aerosol filter samples were collected at sea in the North
   Atlantic from both ambient aerosol and artificially generated primary
   sea spray over four cruises timed to capture the seasonal phytoplankton
   bloom dynamics. Samples were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR), extracted into water, and analyzed by offline
   thermal desorption chemical ionization mass spectrometry (TDCIMS) and
   ion chromatography (IC). A positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis
   identified several characteristic aerosol components in the TDCIMS mass
   spectra. Among these is a polysaccharide factor representing about 10
   \%-30 \% of the submicron organic aerosol mass. Aerosol polysaccharide:
   sodium mass ratios were consistently higher in ambient air than in the
   artificially generated sea spray, and we hypothesize that this results
   from more rapid wet deposition of sodium-rich aerosol. An unquantified
   recalcitrant factor of highly thermally stable organics showed
   significant correlation with FTIR-measured alcohol groups, consistently
   the main organic functional group associated with sea spray aerosol. We
   hypothesize that this factor represents recalcitrant dissolved organic
   matter (DOM) in seawater and that by extension alcohol functional groups
   identified in marine aerosol may more typically represent recalcitrant
   DOM rather than biogenic saccharide-like material, contrary to
   inferences made in previous studies. The recalcitrant factor showed
   little seasonal variability in its contribution to primary marine
   aerosol. The relative contribution of polysaccharides was highest in
   late spring and summer in the smallest particle size fraction
   characterized (< 180 nm).}},

Abstract = {{Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), due to their fascinating
   properties, have emerged as potential next-generation semiconducting
   nanomaterials across diverse fields of applications. When combined with
   other material systems, precise control of the intrinsic properties of
   the TMDs plays a vital role in maximizing their performance.
   Defect-induced atomic doping through introduction of a chalcogen vacancy
   into the TMDs lattices is known to be a promising strategy for
   modulating their characteristic properties. As a result, there is a need
   to develop tunable and scalable synthesis routes to achieve
   vacancy-modulated TMDs. Herein, we propose a facile liquid-phase ligand
   exchange approach for scalable, uniform, and vacancy-tunable synthesis
   of TMDs films. Varying the relative molar ratio of the chalcogen to
   transition metal precursors enabled the in situ modulation of the
   chalcogen vacancy concentrations without necessitating additional
   post-treatments. When employed as the electrocatalyst in the hydrogen
   evolution reaction (HER), the vacancy-modulated TMDs, exhibiting a
   synergetic effect on the energy level matching to the reduction
   potential of water and optimized free energy differences in the HER
   pathways, showed a significant enhancement in the hydrogen production
   via the improved charge transfer kinetics and increased active sites.
   The proposed approach for synthesizing tunable vacancy-modulated TMDs
   with wafer-scale synthesis capability is, therefore, promising for
   better practical applications of TMDs.}},

Journal = {{CELL REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{Upon DNA damage, the ALC1/CHD1L nucleosome remodeling enzyme (remodeler)
   is activated by binding to poly(ADP-ribose). How activated ALC1
   recognizes the nucleosome, as well as how this recognition is coupled to
   remodeling, is unknown. Here, we show that remodeling by ALC1 requires a
   wild-type acidic patch on the entry side of the nucleosome. The
   cryo-electron microscopy structure of a nucleosome-ALC1 linker complex
   reveals a regulatory linker segment that binds to the acidic patch.
   Mutations within this interface alter the dynamics of ALC1 recruitment
   to DNA damage and impede the ATPase and remodeling activities of ALC1.
   Full activation requires acidic patch-linker segment interactions that
   tether the remodeler to the nucleosome and couple ATP hydrolysis to
   nucleosome mobilization. Upon DNA damage, such a requirement may be used
   to modulate ALC1 activity via changes in the nucleosome acidic patches.}},

Abstract = {{Liquid marbles are gaining increased attention because of their added
   advantages such as low evaporation rates, less friction, and ease of
   manipulation over the pristine liquid drop. Their functionalities could
   be further enhanced by incorporating different types of particles (size,
   hydrophobicity, chemical properties, etc.), commonly called Janus liquid
   marbles (JLMs). However, their fabrication process remains a challenge,
   especially when we require continuous production. Here, we present a
   simple and fast approach for the fabrication of JLMs covered with nano-
   and microparticles in an additive-free environment based on the
   controlled impact of a water drop over the particle beds. The
   fabrication process involves collection of polyvinylidene difluoride
   particles (PVDF, particle type 1) by a water drop followed by its impact
   over an uncompressed bed of black toner particles (BTP, particle type
   2). The whole process takes a time of approximately 30 ms only. The drop
   impact and the condition of the JLM formation were explained based on
   the Weber number (We) and maximum spread (beta(m)) analysis. A
   theoretical model based on the energy balance analysis is performed to
   calculate the maximum spreading (beta(m)), and the experimental and
   theoretical analyses are found to be in good agreement. Tunability in
   particle coverage is demonstrated by varying the droplet volume in the
   range of 5-15 mu L. We further extend this strategy for the fast and
   continuous production of nearly identical JLMs, which could enhance the
   capabilities of open-surface microfluidic applications.}},

Title = {{Lgr5 Marks Adult Progenitor Cells Contributing to Skeletal Muscle
   Regeneration and Sarcoma Formation}},
Journal = {{CELL REPORTS}},

Abstract = {{Regeneration of adult skeletal muscle is driven largely by resident
   satellite cells, a stem cell population increasingly considered to
   display a high degree of molecular heterogeneity. In this study, we find
   that Lgr5, a receptor for Rspo and a potent mediator of Wnt/beta-catenin
   signaling, marks a subset of activated satellite cells that contribute
   to muscle regeneration. Lgr5 is found to be rapidly upregulated in
   purified myogenic progenitors following acute cardiotoxin-induced
   injury. In vivo lineage tracing using our
   Lgr5-2ACre(ERT2)R26tdTomato(LSL) reporter mouse model shows that Lgr5(+)
   cells can reconstitute damaged muscle fibers following muscle injury, as
   well as replenish the quiescent satellite cell pool. Moreover,
   conditional mutation in Lgr52ACre(ERT2);Kras(G12D);Trp53(flox/flox) mice
   drives undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma formation in adult mice,
   thereby substantiating Lgr5(+) cells as a cell of origin of sarcomas.
   Our findings provide the groundwork for developing
   Rspo/Wnt-signaling-based therapeutics to potentially enhance
   regenerative outcomes of skeletal muscles in degenerative muscle
   diseases.}},

Abstract = {{In order to improve the photocatalytic performance of BiFeO3, we
   prepared BiFeO3 nanoparticles doped with different molar concentrations
   of Y by thermal decomposition of MOFs precursor. The samples were
   characterized by XRD, TG, FESEM, XPS, UV-vis, and PL. The results of XRD
   and XPS reveal that Y3+ have been successfully incorporated into BiFeO3
   lattice. FESEM and UV-vis results reveal that Y doping leads to a
   decrease in BiFeO3 particle size and band gap. PL shows that the
   recombination rate of photogenerated electron hole pairs of
   Bi0.95Y0.05FeO3 is the lowest. The influences of Y doping content on
   photocatalytic activity of BiFeO3 have been investigated. The results
   show that the best photocatalytic activity is Bi0.95Y0.05FeO3. Compared
   with pure BiFeO3, Bi0.95Y0.05FeO3 increased the degradation rate of MO
   by 1.3 times in 120 min. This may be due to the larger light response
   range and the lower photogenerated electron hole pairs recombination
   rate.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the fault tolerant control (FTC) of an unmanned
   airship with multiple vectored thrusters in the presence of model
   parameter uncertainties and unknown wind disturbances. A fault tolerant
   control based on constrained adaptive backstepping (CAB) approach,
   combined with a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN)
   approximation, is proposed for the airship with thruster faults. A wind
   observer is designed to estimate the bounded wind disturbances. An
   adaptive fault estimator is proposed to estimate the unknown actuator
   faults. A weighted pseudo inverse based control allocation is
   incorporated to reconstruct and optimize the practical control inputs of
   the failed airship under constraints of actuator saturation. Rigorous
   stability analysis shows that trajectory tracking errors of the airship
   position and attitude converge to the desired set through Lyapunov
   theory. Numerical simulations demonstrate the fault tolerant trajectory
   tracking capability of the proposed NN-CAB controller under the actuator
   faults, even in the presence of aerodynamic coefficient uncertainties,
   and unknown wind disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{Heat stroke and severe fever cause anemia, although the underlying
   mechanism remains unclear. Here, we report the use of Cerium oxide
   nanoparticles in protection of red blood cells against damage caused by
   exposure to short-term hyperthermia (42 degrees C, 10 min). Red blood
   cells exposed to hyperthermia exhibited extradition senescence with
   higher density, smaller size and lower zeta potential relative to those
   under normal physiological environment (37 degrees C, 10 min).
   Furthermore, hyperthermia-exposed cells exhibited significantly higher
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) production compared to the normal
   conditions. Importantly, the preconditional treatment, using Ceria
   nanoparticles (CNPs), ameliorated senescence and apoptosis in red blood
   cells damaged by hyperthermia by reducing ROS levels. Summarily,
   short-term hyperthermia caused a significant increase in ROS in red
   blood cells, and resulted in senescence and apoptosis. These may be
   possible mechanisms of pathological changes in red blood cells exposed
   to heat stroke or severe fever. Overall, these findings indicate that
   CNPs strongly inhibit ROS production, and effectively ameliorates
   hyperthermia-induced damages in red blood cells.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, rotational molding was used to produce parts based on a
   blend of linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) and polyamide 6 (PA6).
   In particular, the concentration of PA6 (0, 10, 20, and 30\% vol) with
   and without a compatibilizer (Surlyn 9020) was investigated via two
   methods: dry blending in a high-shear mixer and melt compounding in a
   twin-screw extruder followed by pulverization. To determine the
   efficiency of the rotomolding process, similar parts were produced via
   compression molding. For rotational molding, dry ice (solid CO2) was
   used to create an inert atmosphere in the mold and the processing
   conditions were followed by the mold internal air temperature traces.
   From the samples produced, thermal, morphological, and mechanical
   properties were measured. The results showed that the rotomolded parts
   of the melt blended compounds generated smaller and better dispersed PA6
   particles in the LLDPE matrix. This finer morphology led to improved
   mechanical properties, especially when the compatibilizer was present.
   But the latter was found to be more effective on the compression-molded
   samples.}},

Title = {{DNA Methylation Silences Exogenous Gene Expression in Transgenic Birch
   Progeny}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{The genetic stability of exogenous genes in the progeny of transgenic
   trees is extremely important in forest breeding; however, it remains
   largely unclear. We selected transgenic birch (Betula platyphylla) and
   its hybrid F1 progeny to investigate the expression stability and
   silencing mechanism of exogenous genes. We found that the exogenous
   genes of transgenic birch could be transmitted to their offspring
   through sexual reproduction. The exogenous genes were segregated during
   genetic transmission. The hybrid progeny of transgenic birch WT1xTP22
   (184) and WT1xTP23 (212) showed higher Bgt expression and greater insect
   resistance than their parents. However, the hybrid progeny of transgenic
   birch TP23xTP49 (196) showed much lower Bgt expression, which was only
   13.5\% of the expression in its parents. To elucidate the mechanism
   underlying the variation in gene expression between the parents and
   progeny, we analyzed the methylation rates of Bgt in its promoter and
   coding regions. The hybrid progeny with normally expressed exogenous
   genes showed much lower methylation rates (0-29\%) than the hybrid
   progeny with silenced exogenous genes (32.35-45.95\%). These results
   suggest that transgene silencing in the progeny is mainly due to DNA
   methylation at cytosine residues. We further demonstrated that
   methylation in the promoter region, rather than in the coding region,
   leads to gene silencing. We also investigated the relative expression
   levels of three methyltransferase genes: BpCMT, BpDRM, and BpMET. The
   transgenic birch line 196 with a silenced Gus gene showed, respectively,
   2.54, 9.92, and 4.54 times higher expression levels of BpCMT, BpDRM, and
   BpMET than its parents. These trends are consistent with and corroborate
   the high methylation levels of exogenous genes in the transgenic birch
   line 196. Therefore, our study suggests that DNA methylation in the
   promoter region leads to silencing of exogenous genes in transgenic
   progeny of birch.}},

Abstract = {{Much of our understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying
   cnidarian-algal symbiosis comes from studying the biological differences
   between the partners when they are engaged in symbiosis and when they
   are isolated from one another. When comparing the in hospite and ex
   hospite states in Symbiodiniaceae, the in hospite state is represented
   by algae sampled from hosts, and the ex hospite state is commonly
   represented by cultured algae. The use of cultured algae in this
   comparison may introduce nutrition as a confounding variable because,
   while hosts are kept in nutrient-depleted conditions, culture media is
   nutrient rich and designed to facilitate algal growth. In this
   perspective, we reexamine how nutrition may be a confounding variable in
   studies that compare the biology of Symbiodiniaceae in hospite and in
   culture. We also suggest several innovations in experimental design to
   strengthen the comparison of the two lifestyles, including the adoption
   of nutritional controls, alternatives to culture for the representation
   of Symbiodiniaceae ex hospite, and the adoption of several proteomic
   approaches to find novel Symbiodiniaceae genes important for symbiosis.}},

Abstract = {{Digital platforms that facilitate care work are new entrants to the

   reveals four means of control that influence the enactment of the labour
   process: Shifting risks and responsibilities from the platform to
   workers and clients; Apportioning the costs of doing business to
   workers; Dictating contractual arrangements; and Monitoring quality
   standards of service work. The findings advance knowledge of how power
   relations embedded in platform business models and the organization of

Abstract = {{Many patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have a
   hyperactive immune response (cytokine storm) which has been incriminated
   in multiorgan dysfunction (MOD). Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and
   granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are the key
   cytokines involved in mediating systemic inflammation and triggering
   endothelial dysfunction. To limit these effects, IL-6 receptor
   inhibitors (IL6ri) have been used in COVID-19 patients. The best
   approach regarding the total number of doses in COVID-19 patients is
   still unclear. In this single-center retrospective study, we
   investigated if multiple doses of tocilizumab (TCZ) prevented
   deterioration of COVID-19 patients. Patients were divided into two
   cohorts hazed on the number of TCZ doses; cohort I (received one dose)
   and cohort 2 (received >= two doses). In both cohorts,
   all-cause-mortality was the primary outcome. Of 270 hospitalized
   patients with COVID-19, 81 patients received TCZ. Fifty patients
   received one dose of TCZ and 31 received >= two doses.
   All-cause-mortality in cohort 2 remained higher (41.9\%) suggesting that
   there was no additional benefit of multiple doses of TCZ to prevent the
   primary outcome. In addition, multiple doses of TCZ did not change any
   other secondary outcome {[}(ICU admission, acute kidney injury (AKI),
   acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury (ACI),
   thrombotic events, septic shock, and total hospital stay].}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundMultiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease that
   damages myelin in the central nervous system (CNS). We investigated the
   profile of CCN3, a known regulator of immune function and a potential
   mediator of myelin regeneration, in multiple sclerosis in the context of
   disease state and disease-modifying treatment.MethodsCCN3 expression was
   analysed in plasma, immune cells, CSF and brain tissue of MS patient
   groups and control subjects by ELISA, western blot, qPCR, histology and
   in situ hybridization.ResultsPlasma CCN3 levels were comparable between
   collective MS cohorts and controls but were significantly higher in
   progressive versus relapsing-remitting MS and between patients on
   interferon-beta versus natalizumab. Higher body mass index was
   associated with higher CCN3 levels in controls as reported previously,
   but this correlation was absent in MS patients. A significant positive
   correlation was found between CCN3 levels in matched plasma and CSF of
   MS patients which was absent in a comparator group of idiopathic
   intracranial hypertension patients. PBMCs and CD4(+) T cells
   significantly upregulated CCN3 mRNA in MS patients versus controls. In
   the CNS, CCN3 was detected in neurons, astrocytes and blood vessels.
   Although overall levels of area immunoreactivity were comparable between
   non-affected, demyelinated and remyelinated tissue, the profile of
   expression varied dramatically.ConclusionsThis investigation provides
   the first comprehensive profile of CCN3 expression in MS and provides
   rationale to determine if CCN3 contributes to neuroimmunological
   functions in the CNS.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background Interleukin 10 has been shown to play a critical role in the
   regulation of the immune responses in allergic diseases.
   Aim To investigate if genetic polymorphisms in the promoter region of
   the IL-10 gene are associated with food allergy (FA) susceptibility in
   Caucasian pediatric patients with concomitant allergic diseases and
   IL-10 levels.
   Methods The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at -1082A > G
   (rs1800896), -819 T > C (rs1800871), and -592A > C (rs1800872) of 62
   pediatric patients with IgE-mediated FA were analyzed and correlated
   with clinical parameters, serum IgE and IL-10 levels. The results were
   compared with those of 92 healthy controls without FA, personal and/or
   family history of atopy.
   Results Analysis and comparison of genotype distributions, allele
   frequencies, and haplotypes showed that none of the genotypes confers an
   increased risk of FA. The genotype -1082 AA in FA patients was
   associated with moderate to severe symptoms of FA, the development of
   atopic asthma, and higher levels of IL-10. In a linear regression study,
   we confirmed that the genotype -1082 AA acts as an independent factor
   for the higher levels of IL-10. A positive association was also observed
   between -819T/C and -592 A/C SNPs and later onset of FA.
   Conclusion Polymorphisms in the promoter region of the IL-10 gene are
   not associated with FA susceptibility in our cohort. In FA patients,
   -1082 A/G SNPs seem to influence the production of IL-10, the severity
   of FA symptoms, and the development of atopic asthma in this population.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction Korean mugwort has been used as a traditional medicine.
   Specifically, air-dried Artemisia princeps Pamp. cv. ssajuari
   (ssajuari-ssuk; Korean mugwort) has been used as moxa in moxibustion
   therapy. Thus, the evaluation of high quality ssajuari-ssuk containing
   herbal volatiles is of great interest in clinical therapy and the food
   industry.
   Objective The aim of this study is to determine whether fast gas
   chromatography with uncoated surface acoustic wave (fast GC/SAW) sensor
   can be a useful technique for performing quality control using herbal
   volatiles of ssajuari-ssuk air-dried for different times.
   Methodology Fast GC/SAW sensor, called ``Electronic zNose{''}, is also a
   headspace sampling method and is an effective simple analytical method
   with a second unit analysis providing on-line measurements without the
   need for pretreatment of the sample. Headspace solid-phase
   microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) was
   employed to confirm the identification of the volatiles and compared to
   fast GC/SAW sensor.
   Results Artemisia princeps Pamp. cv. ssajuari air-dried for 2 years and
   4 months (the third year), containing the highest total amount of herbal
   volatiles, was superior to the others (the first year, the second year,
   the fourth year) in quality. Moreover, fast GC/SAW sensor shows a high
   repeatability (relative standard deviation 0.77\% similar to 6.23\%),
   excellent sensitivity (limit of detection value of 0.47 pg/mL), and good
   linearity (correlation coefficient r(2) = 0.997) over the range of
   nanogram for alpha-thujone.
   Conclusion Therefore, the fast GC/SAW sensor can be a useful analytical
   method for the discrimination and quality control of volatiles of herbal
   and medicinal plants according to air-drying time, as it provides a
   simple and second unit analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Approved medications for alcohol use disorder (AUD) display modest
   effect sizes. Pharmacotherapy aimed at the mechanism(s) by which ethanol
   activates the dopamine reward pathway may offer improved outcomes. Basal
   and ethanol-induced accumbal dopamine release in the rat involve glycine
   receptors (GlyR) in the nucleus accumbens (nAc). Glycine transporter 1
   (GlyT-1) inhibitors, which raise extracellular glycine levels, have
   repeatedly been shown to decrease ethanol intake in the rat. To further
   explore the rational for elevating glycine levels in the treatment of
   AUD, this study examined accumbal extracellular glycine and dopamine
   levels and voluntary ethanol intake and preference in the rat, after
   systemic treatment with glycine. The effects of three different doses of
   glycine i.p. on accumbal glycine and dopamine levels were examined using
   in vivo microdialysis in Wistar rats. In addition, the effects of the
   intermediate dose of glycine on voluntary ethanol intake and preference
   were examined in a limited access two-bottle ethanol/water model in the
   rat. Systemic glycine treatment increased accumbal glycine levels in a
   dose-related manner, whereas accumbal dopamine levels were elevated in a
   subpopulation of animals, defined as dopamine responders. Ethanol intake
   and preference decreased after systemic glycine treatment. These results
   give further support to the concept of elevating central glycine levels
   to reduce ethanol intake and indicate that targeting the glycinergic
   system may represent a pharmacologic treatment principle for AUD.}},

Title = {{Vertical distribution of different pools of soil organic carbon under
   long-term fertilizer experiment on rice-wheat sequence in mollisols of
   North India}},
Journal = {{COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS}},
Abstract = {{A profound consideration of soil organic carbon (SOC) and SOC pools as
   affected by the long-term use of fertilizer in a fixed crop sequence is
   essential to understand and maintain the health and productivity of
   soil. The dynamics of SOC pools, i.e. total soil organic carbon (TOC)
   and its different fractions under a rice-wheat cropping system subjected
   to various fertilizer management strategies over 42 years was
   investigated near Uttarakhand, India. The soil at the experimental site
   was an Aquic Hapludoll consisting of a poorly drained silty clay loam
   (1-1.5 m deep) overlying loamy to sandy sediments. Over 42 years,
   application of 100\% NPK+ FYM (Farm Yard Manure) was the most effective
   management system in increasing organic C up to 0 to 60 cm soil depths
   under rice-wheat sequence. The combination of this integrated input
   application (100\% NPK + 15 t ha(-1) FYM) significantly built organic
   carbon fractions like total organic carbon, microbial biomass C (MBC),
   particulate organic C (POC), KMnO4 oxidizable C, Humic C, Fulvic C,
   Humin C, water-soluble carbon and hot water extractable carbohydrates at
   all four soil depths. Hence, application of FYM along with NPK resulted
   in a significant positive building up of all pools in the treatment at
   all four depths. Therefore, balance fertilization is panaceally
   important for sustaining improved soil health with balanced organic
   status and production potentiality of the soil for rice-wheat cropping
   sequence.}},

   the Iberian Peninsula}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{40}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Chemical monitoring data sets such as those provided by the
   implementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) offer
   opportunities to evaluate the ecological risks of pesticides under large
   spatiotemporal scales and to evaluate the protectiveness of the current
   prospective risk-assessment framework. As a case study, we used the
   monitoring data set for the insecticide chlorpyrifos to perform a
   probabilistic risk assessment for Iberian surface-water ecosystems. The
   specific objectives of the study were 1) to assess the occurrence of
   chlorpyrifos in relation to different agricultural production land uses,
   2) to assess the spatiotemporal variation in the exceedance of the
   European WFD short- and long-term environmental quality standards
   (maximum allowable concentration environmental quality standard
   {[}MAC-EQS] and annual average {[}AA] EQS), and 3) to perform a
   probabilistic risk assessment for freshwater invertebrates. A database
   that contains chlorpyrifos concentrations from 14 600 surface water
   samples taken between 2012 and 2017 in the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and
   Portugal) was analyzed, and chlorpyrifos was detected in 21\% of these
   samples. The MAC-EQS was exceeded in 2\% of the cases, whereas the
   AA-EQS was exceeded in 18\% of the cases. The majority of the
   exceedances took place in the littoral areas of the eastern and
   southeastern parts of the Iberian Peninsula, particularly in areas with
   dominant citrus production during late spring, late summer, and autumn.
   The present study indicates unacceptable risks posed by chlorpyrifos to
   Iberian surface waters over the study period, although it was approved
   for use in Europe. The present study supports the need to perform
   further postregistration monitoring assessments with other pesticides
   following similar approaches, which can help to identify possible
   pesticide-misuse practices and improvements of the prospective
   risk-assessment framework. Environ Toxicol Chem 2020;00:1-13. (c) 2020

   Individuals}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Empirical evidence demonstrates mental health disparities between sexual
   and gender minority individuals (SGM) compared with cisgender
   heterosexual individuals. SGM individuals report elevated rates of
   emotional distress, symptoms related to mood and anxiety disorders,
   self-harm, and suicidal ideation and behavior. Social support is
   inversely related to psychiatric symptoms, regardless of SGM status. The
   COVID-19 pandemic-with its associated limited social
   interactions-represents an unprecedented period of acute distress with
   potential reductions in accessibility of social support, which might be
   of particular concern for SGM individuals' mental well-being. In the
   present study, we explored the extent to which potential changes in
   mental health outcomes (depressive symptoms, worry, perceived stress,
   positive and negative affect) throughout the duration of the pandemic
   were related to differences in perceptions of social support and
   engagement in virtual social activity, as a function of SGM status.
   Utilizing a large sample of US adults (N = 1,014; 18\% reported SGM
   status), we assessed psychiatric symptoms, perceptions of social
   isolation, and amount of time spent socializing virtually at 3 time
   windows during the pandemic (between March 21 and May 21). Although SGM
   individuals reported greater levels of depression compared with non-SGM
   individuals at all 3 time points, there was no interaction between time
   and SGM status. Across all participants, mental health outcomes improved
   across time. Perceived social isolation was associated with poorer
   mental health outcomes. Further, time spent engaging in virtual
   socialization was associated with reduced depression, but only for those
   in self-reported quarantine. We discuss these results in terms of the
   nature of our sample and its impact on the generalizability of these
   findings to other SGM samples as well as directions for future research
   aimed at understanding potential health disparities in the face of the
   COVID-19 pandemic.}},

Abstract = {{Although COVID-19 has been reported to be associated with high rates of
   venous thromboembolism (VTE), the risk of VTE and bleeding after
   hospitalization for COVID-19 remains unclear, and the optimal hospital
   VTE prevention strategy is not known. We collected retrospective
   observational data on thrombosis and bleeding in 303 consecutive adult
   patients admitted to the hospital for at least 24 hours for COVID-19.
   Patients presenting with VTE on admission were excluded. Data were
   collected until 90 days after admission or known death by using medical
   records and an established national VTE network. Maximal level of care
   was ward based in 78\% of patients, with 22\% requiring higher
   dependency care (12\% noninvasive ventilation, 10\% invasive
   ventilation). Almost all patients (97.0\%) received standard
   thromboprophylaxis or were already receiving therapeutic anticoagulation
   (17.5\%). Symptomatic image-confirmed VTE occurred in 5.9\% of patients
   during index hospitalization, and in 7.2\% at 90 days after admission
   (23.9\% in patients requiring higher dependency care); half the events
   were isolated segmental or subsegmental defects on lung imaging.
   Bleeding occurred in 13 patients (4.3\%) during index hospitalization
   (1.3\% had major bleeding). The majority of bleeds occurred in patients
   on the general ward, and 6 patients were receiving treatment-dose
   anticoagulation, highlighting the need for caution in intensifying
   standard thromboprophylaxis strategies. Of 152 patients discharged from
   the hospital without an indication for anticoagulation, 97\% did not
   receive thromboprophylaxis after discharge, and 3\% received 7 days of
   treatment with low molecular weight heparin after discharge. The rate of
   symptomatic VTE in this group at 42 days after discharge was 2.6\%,
   highlighting the need for large prospective randomized controlled trials
   of extended thromboprophylaxis after discharge in COVID-19.}},

   of envy and the buffering role of aggression-preventive supervisor
   behavior within the proposed relationship.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Data were collected in two phases separated by an interval of four
   weeks. The final sample consisted of 224 full-time white-collar
   employees working in five large pharmaceutical manufacturing
   organizations in India.
   Findings
   The findings indicate that employees' subjective perceptions of being
   involved in poorer-quality LMX relationships than their workgroup
   members generate envy, which, in turn, evokes them to instigate uncivil
   behaviors onto those higher-LMX counterparts. The indirect effect of LMX
   social comparison on instigated workplace incivility through envy gets
   attenuated when supervisors engage in aggression-preventive behavior.
   Practical implications
   To protect organizations from the financial and productivity losses
   associated with incivility, supervisors are encouraged to exhibit
   aggression-preventive behavior if they form differentiated exchange
   relationships with the subordinates in their teams. Supervisors are
   further advised to avoid the altogether neglect of lower-LMX
   subordinates as doing so may give rise to negative emotions (envy) and
   behavior (incivility) among them.
   Originality/value
   This study expands the limited body of knowledge on the antecedents of
   uncivil employee behavior in the workplace. Specifically, it unveils
   that incivility toward coworkers may be stemming from unfavorable LMX
   social comparisons and ensuing negative emotions such as envy. It also
   offers insights on reducing uncivil behavior by highlighting that the
   impact of LMXSC and envy on incivility instigation gets buffered in the
   presence of aggression-preventive supervisor behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The penetration of solar energy into the distribution network is
   affected by the seasonal and day-to-day variability of the solar power
   generation. In underdeveloped and developing countries, the power
   quality (PQ) deterioration issues are primarily observed due to the
   presence of the weak utility grid. Therefore, smart grid operability is
   achieved through power exchange along with the improvement in PQ indices
   by the application of the biquad filter, thereby exhibiting
   multifunctional control capability. The biquad filter is less affected
   by quantization errors and involves no additional usage of sensors or
   control loops, which are the significant advantages observed in its
   implementation. The biquad filter utilization in this work, includes the
   estimation of fundamental load current along with mitigation of
   harmonics, improving PQ, reactive power compensation, and satisfactory
   performance during voltage unbalance, sag, distortion, swell, and
   unbalanced loading conditions, which are observed during weak grid
   conditions. The stochastic inputs of the solar PV array interfaced
   utility grid system are agitated due to the erratic availability of
   solar power, and are overcome through an adaptive perturb and observe
   technique, which uses a variable perturbation step size. Test cases
   considered here, validate the performance in accordance to the IEEE-519
   standard.}},

Abstract = {{The low-lying states of graphene contain exciting topological properties
   that depend on the interplay of different symmetry-breaking terms. The
   corresponding energy gaps remained unexplored until recently due to the
   low-energy scale of the terms involved (few tens of mu eV). These
   low-energy terms include sublattice splitting, the Rashba coupling, and
   the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling, whose balance determines the
   topological properties. In this work, we unravel the contributions
   arising from the sublattice and the intrinsic spin orbit splitting in
   graphene on hexagonal boron-nitride. Employing resistively detected
   electron spin resonance, we identify a sublattice splitting of the order
   of 20 mu eV, and we confirm an intrinsic spin orbit coupling of
   approximately 45 mu eV. The dominance of the latter suggests a
   topologically nontrivial state, involving fascinating properties.
   Electron spin resonance is a promising route toward unveiling the
   intriguing band structure at low-energy scales.}},

Volume = {{4}},

Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{Intrabone (IB) injection of umbilical cord blood has been proposed as a
   potential mechanism to improve transplant engraftment and prevent graft
   failure. However, conventional IB techniques produce low retention of
   transplanted cells in the marrow. To overcome this barrier, we developed
   an optimized IB (OIB) injection method using low-volume,
   computer-controlled slow infusion that promotes cellular retention in
   the marrow. Here, we compare engraftment of CD34(+) cells transplanted
   in a myeloablative rhesus macaque (RM) model using the OIB method
   compared with IV delivery. RM CD34(+) cells obtained by apheresis were
   split equally for transduction with lentiviral vectors encoding either
   green fluorescent protein or yellow fluorescent protein reporters.
   Following conditioning, one marked autologous population of CD34(+)
   cells was injected directly IB using the OIB method and the other was
   injected via slow IV push into the same animal (n = 3). Daily flow
   cytometry of blood quantified the proportion of engrafting cells
   deriving from each source. Marrow retention was examined using positron
   emission tomography/computed tomography imaging of (89)Zirconium
   (Zr-89)-oxine-labeled CD34(+) cells. CD34(+) cells injected via the OIB
   method were retained in the marrow and engrafted in all 3 animals.
   However, OIB-transplanted progenitor cells did not engraft any faster
   than those delivered IV and contributed significantly less to
   hematopoiesis than IV-delivered cells at all time points. Rigorous
   testing of our OIB delivery system in a competitive RM myeloablative
   transplant model showed no engraftment advantage over conventional IV
   infusion. Given the increased complexity and potential risks of IB vs IV
   approaches, our data do not support IB transplantation as a strategy to
   improve hematopoietic engraftment.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{The promotion of industrial environmental efficiency (IEE) has attracted
   considerable attention from scholars and policymakers. Previous studies
   have focused on the factors driving IEE without considering the
   leader-follower relationship between the two stages of IEE and have used
   aggregated indicators to detect the effect of urbanization on IEE. In
   this study, we open the ``black box{''} of IEE and regard it as a serial
   system comprised of the economic development (ED) stage and the
   environmental governance (EG) stage. We select typical provinces
   belonging to the ED-oriented regions and EG-oriented regions for our
   analysis. We quantify IEE by using the slack-based model (SBM),
   decompose the effect of urbanization into four typical factors and
   detect the effect of the urbanization-related factors by using a tobit
   regression model. Next, we compare the effect of the
   urbanization-related factors in the different regions. The results show
   that overall, in 2011-2015, IEE in the different regions was low and
   fluctuating, and it increased in ED-oriented regions while remaining
   stable in EG-oriented regions. The IEE of the ED-oriented regions was
   always higher than that of the EG-oriented regions, with the gap
   increasing over time. The IEE of the two stages varied in each type of
   region. Urbanization-related factors had different effects on the IEE of
   the different stages in the two types of region, and the same factor had
   significantly different effects in different regions.}},

Title = {{Structural and Extralinguistic Aspects of Code-Switching: Evidence From
   Papiamentu-Dutch Auditory Sentence Matching}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{Despite a wealth of studies on effects of switch locations in
   code-switching (CS), we know relatively little about how structural
   factors such as switch location and extralinguistic factors such as
   directionality preferences may jointly modulate CS (cf., Stell and
   Yapko, 2015). Previous findings in the nominal domain suggest that
   within-constituent switching (within the noun phrase) may be easier to
   process than between-constituent switching (a structural effect), and
   that there may also be directionality effects with switches preferred
   only in one language direction (an extra-linguistic effect). In this
   study we examine a different domain, namely how VP-external (preverbal)
   vs. VP-internal (postverbal) switch location and switch directionality
   affects the processing of Papiamentu-Dutch mixed subject-verb-object
   (SVO) sentences. We manipulated switch location (preverbal/postverbal),
   and directionality of switch (PD/DP) and tested 50 Papiamentu-Dutch
   bilinguals on an auditory sentence matching task. The results from the
   mixed conditions showed no effect of switch location. Instead, we found
   only an effect of directionality and in an unexpected direction for this
   population, with switches from Dutch to Papiamentu being processed
   faster than switches from Papiamentu to Dutch regardless of switch
   location. The results highlight the importance of taking extralinguistic
   factors into account, but also the challenges of studying CS,
   particularly in lesser studied speech communities, and the need for a
   data-driven, cross-disciplinary approach to the study of CS.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Hydatid cyst (HC) of lung is a frequently encountered

   Methods: This prospective, observational study was conducted from
   February 2019 until May 2020. Patients were divided into two groups:
   simple HC (Group A) and complex HC (Group B). Preoperative
   complications, surgical procedures, postoperative complications,
   duration of hospital stay, duration of chest tube placement and need for
   readmission were noted and compared between the two groups. All data was
   processed through the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS)
   Statistics version 22 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).
   Results: Sixty-two patients were included out of which Group A had 28
   (45.2\%) patients and Group B had 34 (54.8\%) patients. There were 39
   (62.9\%) males and 23 (37.1\%) females. The mean age was 31.11 +/- 11.02
   years. Preoperative complications in Group B included empyema seen in 10
   (28.5\%) patients, rupture of cyst into bronchus in 8 (23.5\%),
   biliopleural fistula in 4 (11.7\%), hydropneumothorax in 2 (5.8\%),
   bronchopleural fistula in 1 (2.9\%), airway compromise in 1(2.9\%) and
   pneumonia in 1(2.9\%) patient. Group B required longer days of chest
   tube placement, longer intensive care unit stay and longer hospital stay
   (p<0.(01). The frequency of postoperative intervention was more in group
   B (p<0.05), therefore requiring readmission.
   Conclusion: Surgery has favorable outcomes in the management of HC of
   lung. Complications associated with complex HC not only requires
   preoperative intervention like chest tubes but can also lead to
   life-threatening complications. There is also a frequent need for
   additional procedures during surgery in cases with complex HC along with
   greater risk of postoperative complications. All these are associated
   with prolonged hospital stay, readmissions and greater morbidity. Hence,
   early diagnosis and referral is needed to avoid these preventable
   complications associated with cyst rupture.}},

Title = {{Lack of guilt, shame, and remorse following weight stigma expression: a
   real-time assessment pilot study}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Weight stigma is pervasive and is associated with negative
   health and psychological outcomes. Few studies have examined weight
   stigma perpetration or the emotions individuals experience after
   perpetrating weight stigma. This study used experience sampling to
   explore the nature and frequency of weight stigma behaviors and
   cognitions and moral emotions (shame, guilt, remorse, pride) in the
   perpetrator following weight stigma perpetration.
   Methods. Participants were college students (N = 31, 77.1\% female).
   Participants completed baseline measures of anti-fat attitudes and one
   week of experience sampling phone prompts assessing: (1) weight stigma
   behaviors and cognitions and (2) moral emotions. Generalized estimating
   equation analyses were used to model trajectories of moral emotions
   after weight stigma events.
   Results. Thirty-one participants reported 1,008 weight stigma events
   over 7.5 days. Feelings of guilt, shame, and remorse decreased after
   weight stigma perpetration. Individuals also reported feeling less proud
   after engaging in weight stigma.
   Conclusions. Weight stigma occurs frequently as reported by
   perpetrators. A lack of remorse, guilt, and shame is evident in
   undergraduates after they express weight stigma; however, individuals in
   this study also reported feeling less pride after perpetration. This
   study highlights the need for future studies to explore the expression
   of weight stigma from the perspective of perpetrators instead of
   targets. Results highlight the pervasiveness and normative nature of
   weight stigma perpetration in everyday life and the need to better
   understand the emotional response following weight stigma perpetration
   as a potential mechanism of its perpetuation.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a new species of dendrobatid frog, Leucostethus bilsa sp.
   nov., using molecular, morphological, and acoustic evidence. We also
   comment on the taxonomic status of four similar Hyloxalus and
   Colostethus. We provide an updated phylogeny of Leucostethus that
   corroborates previous hypotheses of relationships of nine species.
   Phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial (i.e., 7095 bp of combined
   data from NADH1, NAHD2, cytochrome c oxidase I, cytochrome b and 12S-16S
   rRNA) and seven nuclear genes (i.e., 4739 bp) indicate a close
   relationship of L. bilsa to an undescribed species from Gorgon. Island,
   Colombia, both of which apparently diverged in the Pliocene about 3
   million years ago with about 6.25\% (i.e., 146/2335 bp) differences for
   the section of 12S-16S mitochondrial fragment. Leucostethus bilsa is
   diurnal and riparian, characterized by distinctive bright mustard-yellow
   flash marks in the axillar and groin regions, posterior belly, and in
   the hindlimbs, the presence of dark gray lower labial stripe or marks,
   sexual dimorphism in ventral pattern, and by having male uniparental
   care. We describe its osteology and the male advertisement call, which
   is a series of peep notes. Osteological microCT images of
   representatives of each of the Colostethinae genera reveal a number of
   intriguing characters that may prove to be useful in phylogenetic
   studies. In terms of its distribution, Leucostethus bilsa is currently
   known only from a very small area within the Reserva Biologica Bilsa,
   located within the Cordillera Mache-Chindul in the Chocoan region of
   northwestern Ecuador, which was a Pliocene-Pleistocene refugium. This
   region is highly threatened with habitat degradation and remains as the
   last surviving refuge for a forest community known for a high proportion
   of endemic species of both flora and fauna.}},

Title = {{Dimension control of in situ fabricated CsPbClBr2 nanocrystal films
   toward efficient blue light-emitting diodes}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{In the field of perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs), the
   performance of blue emissive electroluminescence devices lags behind the
   other counterparts due to the lack of fabrication methodology. Herein,
   we demonstrate the in situ fabrication of CsPbClBr2 nanocrystal films by
   using mixed ligands of 2-phenylethanamine bromide (PEABr) and
   3,3-diphenylpropylamine bromide (DPPABr). PEABr dominates the formation
   of quasi-two-dimensional perovskites with small-n domains, while DPPABr
   induces the formation of large-n domains. Strong blue emission at 470 nm
   with a photoluminescence quantum yield up to 60\% was obtained by mixing
   the two ligands due to the formation of a narrower quantum-well width
   distribution. Based on such films, efficient blue PeLEDs with a maximum
   external quantum efficiency of 8.8\% were achieved at 473 nm.
   Furthermore, we illustrate that the use of dual-ligand with respective
   tendency of forming small-n and large-n domains is a versatile strategy
   to achieve narrow quantum-well width distribution for photoluminescence
   enhancement. Designing efficient blue perovskite LEDs by using mixed
   halides perovskite is still a challenge, limited mainly by the phase
   segregation issue. Here, the authors demonstrate in situ fabrication of
   quasi-2D CsPbClBr2 nanocrystal films with mixed ligands to overcome the
   constraint.}},

Abstract = {{Biological tissues are capable of stiffening and self-healing as they
   are strained or damaged in order to preserve their integrity and
   functionalities. However, mimicking both strain-stiffening and
   self-healing functions of biological tissues in biocompatible flexible
   hydrogels remains a challenge. Here, we report a flexible hydrogel
   constructed by two biocompatible polymers, which can smartly adopt
   biological strain-stiffening or self-healing strategy to maintain the
   structural integrity and functionalities in response to mechanical
   deformation. The hydrogel can be reversibly and repeatedly stiffened up
   to eight times of its original modulus as it is strained, without
   showing mechanical hysteresis. Besides, the damaged hydrogel can
   repeatedly self-heal within seconds and fully retains the
   strain-stiffening capability. In addition, benefitting from the
   excellent biocompatibility and dynamic nature, the biomimetic hydrogel
   can be facilely applied for 3D cell encapsulation. This work provides
   novel insights into the molecular design of tissue-like self-protective
   soft materials, which may also inspire the development of biomimetic
   cell culture matrices, artificial tissues, as well as soft machines and
   robotics for various biomedical and engineering applications.}},

Abstract = {{There exists a variety of interval estimators for the overall treatment
   effect in a random-effects meta-analysis. A recent literature review
   summarizing existing methods suggested that in most situations, the
   Hartung-Knapp/Sidik-Jonkman (HKSJ) method was preferable. However, a
   quantitative comparison of those methods in a common simulation study is
   still lacking. Thus, we conduct such a simulation study for continuous
   and binary outcomes, focusing on the medical field for application.
   Based on the literature review and some new theoretical considerations,
   a practicable number of interval estimators is selected for this
   comparison: the classical normal-approximation interval using the
   DerSimonian-Laird heterogeneity estimator, the HKSJ interval using
   either the Paule-Mandel or the Sidik-Jonkman heterogeneity estimator,
   the Skovgaard higher-order profile likelihood interval, a parametric
   bootstrap interval, and a Bayesian interval using different priors. We
   evaluate the performance measures (coverage and interval length) at
   specific points in the parameter space, that is, not averaging over a
   prior distribution. In this sense, our study is conducted from a
   frequentist point of view. We confirm the main finding of the literature
   review, the general recommendation of the HKSJ method (here with the
   Sidik-Jonkman heterogeneity estimator). For meta-analyses including only
   two studies, the high length of the HKSJ interval limits its practical
   usage. In this case, the Bayesian interval using a weakly informative
   prior for the heterogeneity may help. Our recommendations are
   illustrated using a real-world meta-analysis dealing with the efficacy
   of an intramyocardial bone marrow stem cell transplantation during
   coronary artery bypass grafting.}},

Abstract = {{The model of a Double Gyre flow by Shadden et al. is a standard
   benchmark data set for the computation of hyperbolic Lagrangian Coherent
   Structures (LCS) in flow data. While structurally extremely simple, it
   generates hyperbolic LCS of arbitrary complexity. Unfortunately, the
   Double Gyre does not come with a well-defined ground truth: the location
   of hyperbolic LCS boundaries can only be approximated by numerical
   methods that usually involve the gradient of the flow map. We present a
   new benchmark data set that is a small but carefully designed
   modification of the Double Gyre, which comes with ground truth
   closed-form hyperbolic trajectories. This allows for computing
   hyperbolic LCS boundaries by a simple particle integration without the
   consideration of the flow map gradient. We use these hyperbolic LCS as a
   ground truth solution for testing an existing numerical approach for
   extracting hyperbolic trajectories. In addition, we are able to
   construct hyperbolic LCS curves that are significantly longer than in
   existing numerical methods.}},

Abstract = {{All-organic dielectric composites are drawing increased attention owing
   to their high operating voltage, low loss, and superior processability.
   However, polymers usually possess a relatively lower dielectric constant
   than most the other dielectrics, which seriously suppresses the
   improvement of their energy density. In this work, multilayer-structured
   composites with excellent dielectric and energy storage properties are
   prepared by the stacking method, and the effect of layer numbers on the
   performance of the composites is studied. High-kappa polymers such as
   poly(vinylidenefluoride) (PVDF) and
   poly(vinylidenefluoride-tertrifluoroethylene-ter-chlorotrifluoroethylene
   ) (P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE)) are used to prepare the composites with different
   layers. It is found that the dielectric constant is up to 14.45 at 1
   kHz, which is increased with the volume fraction of the P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE)
   layer and layer number of the composites. Due to the increased
   dielectric constant, an ultrahigh discharge energy density of 18.12
   J/cm(3) is achieved at the electric field of 620 kV/mm. This study
   exhibits an effective routine to prepare flexible high-performance
   dielectric materials.}},

Abstract = {{The connectivity of a graph is an important issue in graph theory and is
   also one of the most important factors in evaluating the reliability and
   fault tolerance of a network. A graph G is called m-edge-fault-tolerant
   strongly Menger (m-EFTSM for short) edge connected if there are
   min\{deg(G-F) (x), deg(G-F) (y)\} edge-disjoint paths between any two
   different vertices x and y in G - F for any F subset of E(G) with
   vertical bar F vertical bar <= m.
   In this paper, we give a necessary and sufficient condition of EFTSM
   edge connectivity on regular graphs. And we obtain several optimal
   results about EFTSM edge connectivity on (1, 2)-matching composition
   networks, each of which is constructed by connecting two graphs via one
   or two perfect matchings. As applications, we show that the class of
   n-dimensional hypercube-like networks (included hypercube, crossed cube
   et al.) are (n - 2)-EFTSM edge connected; show that the n-dimensional
   folded hypercube is (n - 1)-EFTSM edge connected, and show that the
   n-dimensional augmented cube is (2n - 3) EFTSM edge connected. The
   bounds (n - 2), (n - 1) and (2n - 3) are sharp. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{The diversity and succession of microbial community and antioxidant
   activity present during the preparation of red raspberry Enzymes with
   and without starter cultures were investigated by high-throughput
   sequencing of 16S rRNA and ITS1 genes and correlation analysis of the
   microbial diversity and antioxidant activity. The results showed that
   the sample inoculated with mixed fermentation had higher antioxidant
   activity than the sample without inoculated fermentation. The
   antioxidant capacity of red raspberry Enzymes increased significantly as
   the fermentation time increased. Firmicutes and Ascomycota were the
   predominant phyla of bacteria and fungi in all samples. At the genus
   level, Rhodococcus and Lactobacillus were the predominating bacteria
   throughout the fermentation process. The genus Kodamaea dominated the
   fungal community of early-fermentation samples with microbial inoculated
   fermentation. Candida spp. grew rapidly in the late stage of
   fermentation in the samples with spontaneous fermentation. Unweighted
   pair-group and PCA analysis revealed that the microbiota structures
   differed between the two groups. RDA and CCA showed that Rhodococcus and
   Kodamaea had positive effects on the DPPH scavenging ability and other
   antioxidant indicators, and the total phenol content had a significant
   and positive correlation coefficient with Gluconobacter. The results
   indicated that the fermentation by microorganisms significantly improves
   the oxidation resistance and helps to improve the quality of the red

Abstract = {{The on-surface synthesis of highly ordered, large-area covalent organic
   framework (COF) monolayers remains a major challenge in polymer
   chemistry. Herein, we investigate the polymerization of asymmetric
   2,5,8-tribromobenzo{[}1,2-b:3,4-b':6,5-b `']trithiophene monomers on
   Au(1 1 1), Ag(1 1 1), and Cu(1 1 1) surfaces, as we have previously
   predicted that the resulting low-symmetry COF can have promising
   electronic properties. With scanning tunneling microscopy experiments
   pointing to the formation of different defective network structures on
   the three surfaces, we have performed density functional theory
   calculations and transition-state pathway analyses to address the COF
   monolayer formation mechanism. Our results highlight that the nature of
   the substrate significantly affects both the adsorption characteristics
   and energetic barriers for the s-cis and s-trans couplings between
   dehalogenated benzotrithiophene radicals. On Au(1 1 1) and Ag(1 1 1),
   s-trans coupling is energetically favored over s-cis coupling, which is
   consistent with the more ordered networks experimentally observed on
   these substrates. However, on Cu(1 1 1), C-C bond formation is far less
   selective, with similar energy barriers for s-trans and s-cis couplings,
   which is consistent with the highly disordered networks observed on this
   surface. These results underline the fact that the s-cis/s-trans
   selectivity of the C-C coupling reactions strongly depends on the
   selection of the metal surface used to mediate these reactions. This
   understanding is an important step toward better control of on-surface
   2D monolayer polymerization with asymmetric pi-conjugated monomers.}},

Abstract = {{Novel Zn-22Al-5Ag-0.2Sc (wt-\%) alloy was fabricated by adding Ag and Sc
   elements in the Zn-22Al alloy. AgZn3 formed after adding Ag element has
   a remarkable refining effect on both alpha and eta phases, and Al3Sc
   formed after adding Sc element can further refine the alpha phase. Due
   to the increased densities of grain boundaries and phase interfaces, the
   Zn-22Al-5Ag-0.2Sc alloy has significantly improved damping at relatively
   high temperatures. At low temperatures, however, due to the decreased
   mobility of interfaces, the damping decreases. Solution and quenching
   treatments can further dramatically improve the damping due to the
   formation of the eutectoid structure composed of sub-micron alpha and
   eta phases. Detailed mechanisms have been discussed.}},

Abstract = {{KBG syndrome is a rare genetic disease characterized mainly by skeletal
   abnormalities, distinctive facial features, and intellectual disability.
   Heterozygous mutations in ANKRD11 gene, or deletion of 16q24.3 that
   includes ANKRD11 gene are the cause of KBG syndrome. We describe two
   patients presenting with short stature and partial facial features,
   whereas no intellectual disability or hearing loss was observed in them.
   Two ANKRD11 variants, c.4039\_4041del (p. Lys1347del) and c.6427C > G
   (p. Leu2143Val), were identified in this study. Both of them were
   classified as variants of uncertain significance (VOUS) by ACMG/AMP
   guidelines and were inherited from their mothers. ANKRD11 could enhance
   the transactivation of p21 gene, which was identified to participate in
   chondrogenic differentiation. In this study, we demonstrated that the
   knockdown of ANKRD11 could reduce the p21-promoter luciferase activities
   while re-introduction of wild type ANKRD11, but not ANKRD11 variants (p.
   Lys1347del or p. Leu2143Val), could restore the p21 levels. Thus, our
   study report two loss-of-function ANKRD11 variants which might provide
   new insight on pathogenic mechanism that correlates ANKRD11 variants
   with the short stature phenotype of KBG syndrome.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon dioxide (CO2)-philic surfactants have broad application prospects
   in organic synthesis, fracture-enhanced oil recovery, polymerization,
   extraction, and other fields and can be used to enhance the viscosity of
   supercritical CO2 (scCO(2)). In this work, the relationship between the
   functional group of the surfactant tail and CO2-philicity is studied
   from a new perspective using density functional theory. Three common
   functional group types (fluorinated, oxidative, and methyl groups) were
   investigated. The analysis of binding energy demonstrates that all three
   types of functional groups can improve the CO2-philicity of the
   surfactant. Among these three kinds of functional groups, the strongest
   interaction with CO2 molecules is observed for oxidative functional
   groups followed by semifluorinated, fluorinated, and methy groups.
   However, the CO2 molecules tend to be adsorbed onto the middle segment
   of the oxidative group, and the intrusion of the CO2 molecules results
   in the low solubility of oxidative surfactants. In contrast, fluorinated
   and methyl groups interact with CO2 at the end of the surfactant tail.
   As a result, the fluorinated surfactants show the best solubility in CO2
   Therefore, the solubility of a surfactant in CO2 is not only related to
   the interaction strength between the surfactant and CO2, it also depends
   on the interaction structure. The results of this study provide a new
   strategy for evaluating surfactant CO2-philicity and provide guidance
   for the design of surfactants with high solubility in scCO(2).}},

Title = {{Circulating NKG2A NKG2D+CD56dimCD16+Natural Killer (NK) Cells as
   Mediators of Functional Immunosurveillance in Kidney Transplant
   Recipients}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF TRANSPLANTATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{25}},
Month = {{DEC 22}},
Abstract = {{Background: Recently, in patients with long-term functioning allografts,
   we showed that high NKG2D+ NK cell numbers in the peripheral blood were
   associated with a higher glomerular filtration rate, whereas high NKG2A+
   NK cells were associated with a lower glomerular filtration rate. Both
   NK cell determinants react with ligands (MIC A/B, HLA-E) expressed on
   stressed cells, such as virus-infected cells, tumor cells, or cells
   activated during graft rejection. In the present study, we attempted to
   characterize these 2 NK cell subsets further.
   Material/Methods: Using flow cytometry, NK cell subsets were analyzed in
   whole-blood samples of 35 stable kidney transplant recipients (serum
   creatinine mean +/- SD: 1.44 +/- 0.45 mg/dl). Blood was obtained 95-3786
   days after transplant (mean +/- SD: 1168 +/- 1011 days after
   transplant).
   Results: High proportions of NKG2A-NKG2D+ NK cells were strongly
   associated with high numbers of CD56dimCD16+ (p=0.001) NK cells
   co-expressing CD107 (P=0.001) and granzyme B (P=0.045), suggesting that
   NKG2A-NKG2D+ NK cells are predominantly cytotoxic. In contrast, high
   numbers of NKG2A+NKG2D- NK cells were strongly associated with low
   numbers of CD56dimCD16+ NK cells expressing CD107 (P=0.026), CD25
   (p=0.008), TGF-beta R (P=0.028), and TGF-beta (P=0.005), suggesting that
   patients with high proportions of NKG2A+NKG2D- NK cells have low
   proportions of NK cell subsets with cytotoxic phenotype.
   Conclusions: A high proportion of NKG2A+NKG2D- NK cells is associated
   with decreased counts of NKG2A-NKG2D+ CD56dimCD16+ cytotoxic NK cells in
   the circulation. This may result in impaired immunosurveillance. We
   would like to hypothesize that NKG2A-NKG2D+ CD56dimCD16+ cytotoxic NK
   cells eliminate MIC A/B-expressing stressed cells which possess a
   potential to harm the transplant. Further studies will have to evaluate
   whether the proportion of NKG2A-NKG2D+ CD56dimCD16+ cytotoxic NK cells
   is a useful biomarker for the prediction of an uncomplicated
   postoperative course in kidney transplant recipients.}},

Abstract = {{This article pays tribute to Vuyani Vellem's work on the relevance of
   Black theology of liberation (BLT) post-1994 in South Africa. Firstly,
   this article provides a synopsis of the political and economic
   `transition' of South Africa before and after democracy. Secondly, the
   article seeks to provide a candid `reflection' on the BLT trajectory,
   especially its critique of white racial theology. Thirdly, the article
   attempts `rethinking' the location of the Bible and the black
   interlocutor in the post-liberation context. Fourthly, the article
   attempts to `reimagining' the relevance of BLT post-1994 with a focus on
   proposed contemporary theologies.
   Contribution: The manuscript is responding to a special issue honouring
   the legacy and scholarship of the late Prof Vuyani Vellem who
   contributed immensely to Black Theology of Liberation (BTL) in the South
   African context. The manuscript attempt to dialogue with Vellem on key
   issue that he raised, especially racial issues and the role of the
   recognition of the black interlocutor. The VukaniBathoTsohangBatho
   special issue is dedicated to this great son of the soil who
   distinguished himself through research in the area of BTL challenging
   issues affecting the majority of black people, issues like racism, land,
   unemployment and economic inequalities in South Africa. This manuscript
   engages with some of these issues hence its relevance to the journal.
   The manuscript argues that as long as social and economic injustices
   exist, Black Liberation Theology (BLT) will remain relevant post 1994
   dispensation.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a life-threatening event with a
   mortality of similar to 10\%. It is relatively uncommon in children and
   literature regarding the condition is sparse. In adults, the classical
   clinical presentation is with pleuritic chest pain, hemoptysis, and
   dyspnea, whereas in children, the presentation is often nonspecific.
   Materials and methods: Clinical features, risk factors, and outcome of
   children with PE presenting to our unit between December, 19 and March,
   2020 were recorded.
   Results: Four children {[}mean age: 10 (6-16) years, 3 females], all
   presenting with tachycardia and dyspnea were diagnosed with PE.
   Different risk factors such as deep vein thrombosis, nephrotic syndrome,
   soft-tissue infection, and infective endocarditis (IE) were identified
   in all patients. One child died while others responded to
   anticoagulation.
   Conclusion: We aim to highlight the importance of timely recognition of
   PE in children with known risk factors for the same. Early recognition
   and timely treatment of PE are critical to save lives.}},

Abstract = {{Fine alignment of large, segmented telescopes is critical for achieving
   high angular resolution. Building an instrument with an equally large
   monolithic aperture is difficult because of the increasing mass and
   volume. Sparse aperture testing is a lower-cost solution to alignment
   and metrology, both in the optics shop and at the observatory. We
   combined sparse aperture testing and curvature sensing to process the
   highly segmented system's final alignment. First, the stitching error,
   including tip/tilt/piston and shifting errors, is analyzed theoretically
   and numerically. These errors are then evaluated by normalized point
   source sensitivity (PSSn), and the change of PSSn during alignment,
   which specifies the residual alignment error, is calculated by the
   defocused donuts. Simulations and experiments demonstrate that the
   system performance improved by more than 35\%. In this paper, we have
   described the incorporation of sparse aperture testing and curvature
   sensing algorithms, which can easily cover the tipping and shifting
   error affecting the traditional methodology. (C) 2020 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an active fault-tolerant control (FTC) strategy for
   a class of non-linear Lipschitz systems. The proposed FTC approach
   employs the integral sliding mode control (ISMC) technique due to its
   inherent capability of dealing with system uncertainties. First, under
   the nominal fault-free condition, the linear matrix inequality technique
   is introduced to design the primary controller for the non-linear
   Lipschitz system. To accommodate the actuator faults/failures, the ISMC
   law is combined with a control allocation scheme that distributes the
   control signals to the redundant actuators. A non-linear octorotor
   system is then used as a test bench to validate the tolerance
   performance of the proposed FTC strategy. In particular, the proposed
   FTC strategy is applied for the inner-loop control, while in the outer
   loop, a fractional-order control approach is used to achieve the precise
   longitude and latitude control. Finally, various simulations are
   performed to justify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.}},

Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{Donor-acceptor integrated ladder-type dithienopyrrolobenzothiadiazole
   (DTPBT)-based conjugated building blocks have been used to develop rigid
   conjugated polymers by copolymerizing them with synthesized ladder-type
   indoloquinoxaline, pi-extended isoindigo and pi-extended
   2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-based conjugated building blocks. Structural
   aspects of synthesized building blocks are studied by single-crystal
   X-ray diffraction, which revealed the co-planar structure of
   indoloquinoxaline-scaffold while twisted but intramolecularly
   hydrogen-bonded structures of pi-extended isoindigo- and
   2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-scaffolds with number of intermolecular
   non-bonding interactions. The synthesized DTPBT-based conjugated
   polymers P-1, P-2 and P-3 are studied for photophysical and
   electrochemical properties and are found to have moderate to good
   visible light absorptivity with HOMO energy levels below -5.0 eV. The
   X-ray diffraction studies indicate strong pi-pi stacking interactions
   induced face-on arrangement of polymer chains respective to the
   substrate. Polymers show pi-pi stacks promoted high space-charge limited
   current (SCLC) hole mobilities ranging between 5.6 x 10(-4)-1.3 x 10(-3)
   cm(2)V(-1)s(-1). The obtained SCLC hole mobility data in tandem with the
   studied structural aspects of monomers and morphological aspects of
   polymers, suggest that the combination of ladder-type DTPBT-scaffolds
   (capable of intermolecular pi-pi interactions) with non-ladder-type
   planar and structurally rigid pi-extended conjugated scaffolds (capable
   of intermolecular pi-pi and other non-bonding interactions) is
   beneficial for getting good hole mobilities.}},

   Assessment}},
Journal = {{SHOCK AND VIBRATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a new structural damage detection framework is proposed
   based on vibration analysis and pattern recognition, which consists of
   two stages: (1) signal processing and feature extraction and (2) damage
   detection by combining the classification result. In the first stage,
   discriminative features were extracted as a set of proposed descriptors
   related to the statistical moment of the spectrum and spectral shape
   properties using five competitive time-frequency techniques including
   fast S-transform, synchrosqueezed wavelet transform, empirical wavelet
   transform, wavelet transform, and short-time Fourier transform. Then,
   forward feature selection was employed to remove the redundant
   information and select damage features from vibration signals. By
   applying different classifiers, the capability of the feature sets for
   damage identification was investigated. In the second stage,
   ensemble-based classifiers were used to improve the overall performance
   of damage detection based on individual classifiers and increase the
   number of detectable damages. The proposed framework was verified by a
   suite of numerical and full-scale studies (a bridge health monitoring
   benchmark problem, IASC-ASCE SHM benchmark structure, and a cable-stayed
   bridge in China). The results showed that the proposed framework was
   superior to the existing single classifier and could assess the damage
   with reduced false alarms.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral analysis of moving animals relies on a faithful recording and
   track analysis to extract relevant parameters of movement. To study
   group behavior and social interactions, often simultaneous analyses of
   individuals are required. To detect social interactions, for example to
   identify the leader of a group as opposed to followers, one needs an
   error-free segmentation of individual tracks throughout time. While
   automated tracking algorithms exist that are quick and easy to use,
   inevitable errors will occur during tracking. To solve this problem, we
   introduce a robust algorithm called epiTracker for segmentation and
   tracking of multiple animals in two-dimensional (2D) videos along with
   an easy-to-use correction method that allows one to obtain error-free
   segmentation. We have implemented two graphical user interfaces to allow
   user-friendly control of the functions. Using six labeled 2D datasets,
   the effort to obtain accurate labels is quantified and compared to
   alternative available software solutions. Both the labeled datasets and
   the software are publicly available.}},

Abstract = {{Casearia sylvestris is an outstanding representative of the Casearia
   genus. This representability comes from its distinctive chemical profile
   and pharmacological properties. This species is widespread from North to
   South America, occurring in all Brazilian biomes. Based on their
   morphology, 2 varieties are recognized: C. sylvestris var. sylvestris
   and C. sylvestris var. lingua . Despite the existence of data about
   their chemical composition, a deeper understanding of the specialized
   metabolism correlation and variation in respect to environmental factors
   and its repercussion over their biological activities was still pending.
   In this study, an UHPLC-DAD-based metabolomics approach was employed for
   the investigation of the chemical variation of 12 C. sylvestris
   populations sampled across 4 Brazilian biomes and ecotones. The
   correlation between infraspecific chemical variability and the cytotoxic
   and antioxidant activities was achieved by multivariate data analysis.
   The analyses showed that C. sylvestris var. lingua prevailed at Cerrado
   areas, and it was correlated with lower cytotoxic activity and high
   level of glycosylated flavonoids. Among them, narcissin and
   isorhamnetin-3- O-alpha -L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1 -> 2)- alpha
   -L-arabinopyranoside showed good correlation with the antioxidant
   activity. Conversely, C. sylvestris var. sylvestris prevailed at the
   Atlantic Forest areas, and it was associated with high cytotoxic
   activity and high content of clerodane diterpenoids. Different casearins
   showed good correlation ( R (2) =0.3-0.70) with the cytotoxic activity.
   These findings highlighted the great complexity among different C.
   sylvestris populations, their chemical profile, and the related
   biological activities. Consequently, it can certainly influence the
   medicinal properties, as well as the quality and efficacy, of C.
   sylvestris phytomedicines.}},

Title = {{The prevalence and impact of migraine and severe headache in the United

   government health surveys}},

Abstract = {{Background and Objectives Accurate, up-to-date estimates of the burden
   of migraine and severe headache are important for evidence-based
   decision-making about workforce needs and the distribution of health
   resources. We used data from US government health surveys to report the
   prevalence, trends, and impact of this condition by age, sex, and
   poverty status.
   Methods We identified the most recent, publicly available summary
   statistics from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey,
   the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, and the National Health
   Interview Survey. We extracted and compiled relevant information from
   each study, with an emphasis on sex, age, and economic-related
   statistics.
   Results The age-adjusted prevalence of migraine and severe headache in
   the United States has remained stable over many years. In 2018, the
   age-adjusted prevalence was 15.9\% across all adults. The sex ratio also
   remains stable, with 21\% of women and 10.7\% of men affected. Migraine
   continues to be an important public health problem, accounting for
   roughly 4 million emergency department (ED) visits in 2016, when
   headache was the fifth most common reason for an ED visit overall and
   the third most common reason for ED visits in females 15-64. Migraine
   also accounted for over 4.3 million office visits. Many adults with
   migraine or severe headaches are disadvantaged. In 2018, for example,
   roughly 40\% of US adults with migraine were unemployed, and a similar
   proportion were classified as poor or ``near poor.{''} Roughly one in
   five had no health insurance and about a third had a high school
   education or less.
   Conclusions Migraine and severe headaches are a serious public health
   issue in the United States, with the highest impact in women of
   childbearing age and those of lower socioeconomic status. Socioeconomic
   disadvantages also are highly prevalent among those with headaches. The
   economic consequences of the current coronavirus pandemic are likely to
   exacerbate all of these inequities. Increased attention to this high
   impact chronic pain condition, and improved funding for treatment
   provision and research, are warranted to reduce the future burden of
   disease.}},

Abstract = {{Nutrient enrichment of rivers and lakes has been increasing rapidly over
   the past few decades, primarily because of agricultural intensification.
   Although nutrient enrichment is known to drive excessive algal and
   microbial growth, which can directly and indirectly change the
   ecological community composition, the resulting changes in food web
   emergent properties are poorly understood. We used ecological network
   analysis (ENA) to examine the emergent properties of 12 riverine food
   webs across a nutrient enrichment gradient in the Manawatu, New Zealand.
   We also derive Keystone Sensitivity Indices to explore whether nutrients
   change the trophic importance of species in a way that alters the
   resilience of the communities to further nutrient enrichment or floods.
   Nutrient enrichment resulted in communities composed of energy
   inefficient species with high community (excluding microbes)
   respiration. Community respiration was several times greater in enriched
   communities, and this may drive hypoxic conditions even without
   concomitant changes in microbial respiration. Enriched communities
   exhibited weaker trophic cascades, which may yield greater robustness to
   energy flow loss. Interestingly, enriched communities were also more
   structurally and functionally affected by species sensitive to flow
   disturbance making these communities more vulnerable to floods.}},

Abstract = {{Prevailing drug delivery strategies rely on the use of synthetic
   nanocarriers like metal nanoparticles and polymeric liposomes to control
   the release of therapeutics in a safe and efficacious manner. Despite
   their high efficiency in encapsulating drugs, these systems exhibit low
   to moderate biocompatibility, low cellular uptake, and sub-optimal
   targeting capabilities. Conversely, cell-derived nanoparticles (CDNs)
   have emerged as a promising alternative to these artificial drug
   delivery carriers for achieving safer clinical outcomes. In this study,
   we have generated CDNs from human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs)
   using a high-yield fabrication strategy. Briefly, hASCs were subjected
   to a cell-shearing approach that entails passing the cells through an
   array of filters, along with serial centrifugations to eliminate
   intracellular contents. Ultimately, the fragmented parent cell membrane
   self-assembles to form the CDNs. This strategy successfully converted
   80\% of the plasma membrane into the novel nanocarriers with an average
   hydrodynamic diameter of 100 nm. Stability analysis confirmed that the
   formulated nanocarriers are stable for over 3 weeks, making them a
   potent candidate for long-term therapies. To demonstrate their potential
   in drug delivery, we encapsulated trehalose, a cell-impermeable sugar
   molecule, into the CDNs via an extrusion loading technique. Drug-loaded
   CDNs were effectively internalized into human umbilical vein endothelial
   cells (HUVECs) and hASCs, without inducing any significant cytotoxicity.
   Overall, the findings of this study establish the potential of
   hASC-derived CDNs as customizable biomimetic nanocarriers for drug
   delivery and other translational medicine applications.}},

Abstract = {{FACs-based (FA(+), formamidinium and Cs+, cesium) perovskite solar cells
   have gained great attention due to their remarkable light and thermal
   stabilities toward practical application of perovskite modules. However,
   the moisture instability and difficulty in scalable fabrication are
   still the main obstacles blocking their photovoltaic applications in
   current status. Here, the employment of novel interaction between crown
   ether with metal cations is introduced to tailor the uniform growth and
   inhibit moisture invasion during the crystallization of alpha-phase
   FACsPbI(3), yielding the successful synthesis of high-quality perovskite
   films in a large scale. Consequently, perovskite solar cells (PSC)
   modules in the total area of 4 x 4 and 10 x 10 cm(2) are readily
   fabricated with respective champion efficiencies of 16.69\% and 13.84\%
   and excellent stability over 1000 h. This facile scaling-up strategy
   assisted by crown ether has shown great promise for pursuing efficient

Abstract = {{Engineering the size, shape and crystallinity of organic semiconductor
   nanostructures (OSNs) offers the opportunity of fine tuning their
   optoelectronic properties for photocatalytic applications. Here, we
   report a facile and general `ice-melting' kinetic control strategy to
   synthesize OSNs with excellent photocatalytic performance. The ultraslow
   release and interaction of organic molecules from ice melting yields an
   ultralow local concentration (similar to five orders of magnitude fewer
   molecules), fundamentally enhancing the energy barrier thus leading to
   their relaxed and ordered assembly into refined nanocrystals (similar to
   one order of magnitude smaller in size, morphological change from
   amorphous to crystalline); such nanocrystals display improved
   light-harvesting and charge transfer properties and consequent
   photocatalytic efficiency towards degrading organic pollutants compared
   to standard OSNs, or even commercial titania photocatalysts (Degussa
   P25); we also generalize the `ice-melting' kinetic control strategy to
   synthesize a series of highly photoactive organic nanocrystals.}},

Abstract = {{Photoactivatable diazidodihydroxido Pt(iv) complex
   trans,trans,trans-{[}Pt(N-3)(2)(OH)(2)(py)(2)] (1; py = pyridine) is a
   promising anticancer agent which can be activated by visible light to
   induce cancer cell death. DNA has been thought to be involved in the
   mechanism of action of this kind of Pt(iv) prodrug. However, the
   detailed photodecomposition pathways of complex 1 and its interaction
   modes with DNA are complex. Herein we report that upon light irradiation
   complex 1 can bind to all four nucleosides covalently with the reduced
   Pt(ii) species. Moreover, apart from the covalent coordination, various
   oxidation adducts of these four nucleosides induced by the reactive
   oxidative species (ROS) generated during the photoactivation of the
   complex 1 have also been identified, especially the induced oxidation of
   adenosine and cytidine which was firstly reported for this kind of
   photoactivatable Pt(iv) prodrug. Such dual-action may contribute to the
   highly potent photo-antiproliferativity of complex 1 towards cancer
   cells, which may account for the unique mechanism of action of the
   photoactivatable diazido Pt(iv) anticancer complexes.}},

Abstract = {{Fabry disease is a rare X-linked lysosomal disorder. Alpha-galactosidase
   A deficiency caused by mutation leads to accumulation of
   glycosphingolipids predominantly in endothelial cells, leading to
   impairment of vascular wall morphology and function. We assessed
   vascular wall hypertrophy (carotid artery intima-media thickness, cIMT),
   endothelial function (brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, FMD),
   presence of atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid and femoral arteries,
   and levels of endothelial adhesion and inflammatory biomarkers in 33
   Fabry patients compared with 66 healthy matched controls. Fabry patients
   had thicker cIMT (0.07 +/- 0.02 vs 0.06 +/- 0.02 cm; P = .021), as well
   as dilated common carotid arteries (0.80 +/- 0.12 vs 0.70 +/- 0.06 cm; P
   < .001), and aortic annulus than controls (3.07 +/- 0.48 vs 2.7 +/- 0.48
   cm; P = .001). Flow-mediated dilation was reduced (4.48 +/- 8.80 vs
   10.67 +/- 8.72\%; P = .001) and atherosclerotic plaques were less
   present in Fabry patients (9.10\% vs 43.94\%; P < .001). Vascular cell
   adhesion molecule-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and
   high-sensitivity CRP were significantly higher and E-selectin lower in
   Fabry patients. Our results suggest that a complex vascular phenotype is
   present in Fabry patients. This represents a challenge for further
   research that could have important clinical applications.}},

Journal = {{DERMATOLOGIC THERAPY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Acne vulgaris (AV) is the most common skin condition affecting
   adolescents, most likely due to elevated androgen levels during puberty.
   Androgens stimulate and enlarge the sebaceous glands and keratinocytes,
   resulting in increased production of sebum and abnormal
   hyperproliferation of keratinocytes which lead to the formation of acne
   lesions. Current standard of care for AV includes topical therapies for
   mild cases and antibiotics or oral retinoids for severe cases. In recent
   years, spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist and diuretic, has been
   applied to the treatment of AV due to its anti-androgen effects.
   Spironolactone is currently recommended in women who use oral
   contraceptives, are refractory to or contraindicated for standard
   treatment, show clinical signs of hyperandrogenism, or present with
   late-onset or persistent-recurrent AV past the teenage years. It is not
   prescribed to adolescents due to potential side effects; however,
   current data studying adults indicate that most side effects are mild,
   and that potential associations with hyperkalemia and increased risk of
   cancer are not sufficiently supported. Hence, we believe that
   spironolactone may be a safe and effective therapy for adolescent AV.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Here, the gene encoding a subtilisin-like protease (protease Als) was
   cloned from Thermoactinomyces vulgaris strain CDF and expressed in
   Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzyme was released into the culture
   medium of E. coli as a mature form (mAls). Purified mAls displayed
   optimal activity at 60-70 degrees C and pH 10.0 using azo-casein as the
   substrate, and showed a half-life of 13.8 h at 70 degrees C. Moreover,
   the activity of thermostable mAls was comparable to or higher than those
   of mesophilic subtilisin Carlsberg and proteinase K at low temperatures
   (10-30 degrees C). Protease Als was also stable in several organic
   solvents and showed high compatibility with commercial laundry
   detergents. Notably, mAls exhibited approximately 100\% of its activity
   at 3 M NaCl, and showed enhanced thermostability with the increase of
   NaCl concentration up to 3 M. Protease Als possesses an excess of
   solvent-accessible acidic amino acid residues, which may account for the
   high halotolerance of the enzyme. Compared with homologous protease C2
   from the same strain, protease Als exhibits substantially lower activity
   toward insoluble keratin substrates but efficiently hydrolyzes soluble
   keratin released from chicken feathers. Additionally, direct
   substitution of the substrate-binding site of protease Als with that of
   protease C2 improves its activity against insoluble keratin substrates.
   By virtue of its polyextremotolerant attribute and kerationolytic
   capacity, protease Als may find broad applications in various industries
   such as laundry detergents, food processing, non-aqueous biocatalysis,
   and feather processing.}},

Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{At criticality, discrete quantum-gravity models are expected to give
   rise to continuum spacetime. Recent progress has established the
   functional renormalization group method in the context of such models as
   a practical tool to study their critical properties and to chart their
   phase diagrams. Here, we apply these techniques to the multi-matrix
   model with ABAB interaction potentially relevant for Lorentzian quantum
   gravity in 3 dimensions. We characterize the fixed-point structure and
   phase diagram of this model, paving the way for functional RG studies of
   more general multi-matrix or tensor models encoding causality and
   subjecting the technique to another strong test of its performance in
   discrete quantum gravity by comparing to known results.}},

Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we revisit experimentally and theoretically the mechanics
   of a tape loop. Using primarily elastic materials (polydimethylsiloxane,
   PDMS, or polycarbonate, PC) and confocal microscopy, we monitor the
   shape as well as the applied forces during an entire cycle of
   compression and retraction of a half-loop compressed between parallel
   glass plates. We observe distinct differences in film shape during the
   cycle; points of equal applied force or equal plate separation differ in
   shape upon compression or retraction. To model the adhesion cycle in its
   entirety, we adapt the `Sticky Elastica' of {[}T. J. W. Wagner et al.,
   Soft Matter, 2013, 9, 1025-1030] to the tape loop geometry, which allows
   a complete analytical description of both the force balance and the film
   shape. We show that under compression the system is generally not
   sensitive to interfacial interactions, whereas in the limit of large
   separation of the confining parallel plates during retraction the system
   is well described by the peel model. Ultimately, we apply this
   understanding to the measurement of the energy release rate of a wide
   range of different cross-linker ratio PDMS elastomer half-loops in
   contact with glass. Finally, we show how the model illuminates an
   incredibly simple adhesion measurement technique, which only requires a
   ruler to perform.}},

Abstract = {{Orthorhombic beta-LiScGe2O6 single crystals were compressed
   hydrostatically up to 10.35 GPa using a diamond anvil cell and
   investigated in situ by means of X-ray diffraction and Raman
   spectroscopy. Crystal-structure investigations at ambient conditions and
   at high pressure show a structural transition from an orthopyroxene-type
   Pbca structure (a approximate to 18.43 angstrom, b approximate to 8.85
   angstrom, and c approximate to 5.34 angstrom at 8.6 +/- 0.1 GPa) to a
   postorthopyroxene type P2(1)/c structure of the new dense
   gamma-LiScGe2O6 (a approximate to 18.62 angstrom, b approximate to 8.85
   angstrom, c approximate to 5.20 angstrom, and beta approximate to 93.1
   degrees at 9.5 +/- 0.1 GPa). The structure refinements reveal displacive
   shifts of 0 atoms associated with a rotation of every other
   tetrahedral-chain unit from the O- to S-type position similar to the
   postorthopyroxene-type MgSiO3. As a consequence of the oxygen
   displacement, the coordination number of Li atoms is changing from {[}S
   + 1] to a proper 6-fold coordination. The transition around P, = 9.0 +/-
   0.1 GPa is associated with a volume discontinuity of Delta V = -1.6\%.
   This orthopyroxene (OEn-Pbca) to postorthopyroxene (pOEn-P2(1)/c)
   transition is the second example of this type of transformation. Precise
   lattice parameters have been determined during isothermal compression.
   The fit of the unit-cell volumes of beta-LiScGe2O6, using a third-order
   Birch-Murnaghan equation of state, yields V-0 = 943.63 +/- 0.11
   angstrom(3), K-0 = 89.8 +/- 0.6 GPa, and dK/dP = 4.75 +/- 0.18 as
   parameters. Evaluation of the data points beyond the critical transition
   pressure using a second-order Birch-Murnaghan equation suggests V-0 =
   940.6 +/- 4.4 angstrom(3) and K-0 = 82.4 +/- 4.8 GPa. A series of
   high-pressure Raman spectra confirm the symmetry-related structural
   transition, with band positions shifting in a noncontinuous manner, thus
   confirming the proposed first-order transition.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   An increasing body of evidence has revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection in
   pregnant women could increase the risk of adverse maternal and fetal
   outcomes. Careful monitoring of pregnancies with COVID-19 and measures
   to prevent neonatal infection are warranted. Therefore, rapid antibody
   tests have been suggested as an efficient screening tool during
   pregnancy.
   Cases
   We analysed the clinical performance during pregnancy of a rapid,
   lateral-flow immunochromatographic assay for qualitative detection of
   SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies. We performed a universal screening
   including 169 patients during their last trimester of pregnancy. We
   present a series of 14 patients with positive SARS-CoV-2
   immunochromatographic assay rapid test result. Immunochromatographic
   assay results were always confirmed by chemiluminescent microparticle
   immunoassays for quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM+IgA
   antibodies as the gold standard. We observed a positive predictive value
   of 50\% and a false positive rate of 50\% in pregnant women, involving a
   significantly lower diagnostic performance than reported in non-pregnant
   patients.
   Discussion
   Our data suggest that although immunochromatographic assay rapid tests
   may be a fast and profitable screening tool for SARS-CoV-2 infection,
   they may have a high false positive rate and low positive predictive
   value in pregnant women. Therefore, immunochromatographic assay for
   qualitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM antibodies must be verified
   by other test in pregnant patients.}},

Abstract = {{Spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.) is the most destructive insect
   pest of spruce forests in Eurasia. However, contact toxicity, in vivo
   metabolism, and ecological functions of host monoterpenes are poorly
   understood at the spruce tree-bark beetle-predator tritrophic level.
   Spruce monoterpenes including S-(-)-alpha-pinene, R-(+)-alpha-pinene,
   and myrcene showed contact toxicity to I. typographus, with LD50 values
   ranging from 22-32 mu g/mg. When topically treated with
   S-(-)-alpha-pinene or R-(+)-alpha-pinene, the amounts of volatile
   metabolites, including 4S-(-)-cis-verbenol,
   4S-(+)-/4R-(-)-trans-verbenol, R-(+)-/S-(-)-verbenone and
   1R-(-)-/1S-(+)-myrtenol, in the hindgut extracts of I. typographus
   varied significantly between sexes, and their quality (enantiomeric
   composition) varied significantly with the chirality of alpha-pinene.
   More importantly, S-(-)-alpha-pinene induced male adults to produce
   large amounts of 4S-(-)-cis-verbenol and S-(-)-verbenone. When topically
   treated with myrcene, the expected semiochemicals such as E-myrcenol,
   ipsenol and ipsdienol were not detected in the beetle hindguts,
   indicating that the pheromone biosynthetic system of I. typographus does
   not participate in the metabolism of host myrcene. In trap tests,
   S-(-)-alpha-pinene and R-(+)-alpha-pinene increased the catches of I.
   typographus and its predator Thanasimus substriatus in pheromone-baited
   traps, whereas myrcene exhibited a strong repellent (or inhibitory)
   effect on I. typographus but not on its predator. I. typographus seems
   to adopt different ecological strategies (e.g. avoidance to myrcene and
   preference for alpha-pinene) to adapt to and tolerate different host
   monoterpenes. Extensive investigation of these monoterpenes will help us
   understand their roles in manipulating the arms race between host trees
   and bark beetles, and potentially improve the efficacy of controlling I.

Abstract = {{Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), caused by PRRS
   virus (PRRSV), is a serious viral disease affecting global swine

   post-translational modification during infection, plays a key regulatory
   role in host antiviral responses. In this study, the global acetylome is
   profiled using acetylation specific antibody-based enrichment and tandem
   mass tag label high-affinity purification liquid chromatography-mass
   spectrometry in PRRSV-infected pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs). As
   a result, 3731 lysine acetylation sites on 1421 cellular proteins are
   identified. Bioinformatics analysis of the different acetylated proteins
   revealed their involvement in various biological processes, including
   the host immune response and energy metabolism. These findings will
   contribute to the understanding of PRRSV pathogenesis and identify new

Abstract = {{The effects of longitudinal-optical phonon scattering and dephasing in
   quantum cascade structures are studied. Three-level longitudinal-optical
   phonon depopulated terahertz structures are investigated using a density
   matrix Monte Carlo method. Ideally, these structures do not contain
   energy states above the upper lasing state, which in principle, can
   reduce parasitic leakage. The light output and current density as a
   function of lattice temperature are calculated and shown to be
   consistent with experiment for a recently reported structure that is
   confirmed to be a good approximation to a three-level structure. The
   pure dephasing time is self-consistently found to be relatively constant
   over the temperature range, which differs from the previous analysis of
   other structures. At higher lattice temperatures, particularly at
   elevated temperatures beyond the lasing point, the reduction in current
   density is rather due largely to rapid longitudinal-optical phonon
   absorption, which reduces the lifetime of the ground state. It is shown
   that the operating temperature limit may further be improved by
   adequately increasing the injector anticrossing.}},

Title = {{Understanding the Internal and External Communicative Drivers of
   Organizational Innovativeness}},
Journal = {{COMMUNICATION RESEARCH}},
Abstract = {{Organizational and communication studies have established that
   communication plays a critical role in organizational innovation,
   because internal and external communication allows individuals, groups,
   and organizations to recombine existing knowledge into new ideas. In
   light of this, this research re-directs our attention to the specific
   communicative antecedents of an organization's overall propensity for
   innovation. Survey data from 293 nonprofit organizations showed that
   interorganizational partnership diversity, knowledge sharing via the use
   of information communication technologies (ICTs), and entrepreneurial
   orientation affect organizational innovativeness, with differential
   effects on administrative innovativeness and technological
   innovativeness. Specifically, interorganizational partnership diversity
   promoted administrative innovativeness but had an inverted U-shaped
   curvilinear relationship with technological innovativeness. Effective
   ICT-mediated knowledge sharing improved technological innovativeness
   only. The combination of interorganizational partnership diversity and
   EO (i.e., proactiveness) increased administrative innovativeness.
   However, interorganizational partnership diversity and effective
   knowledge sharing indirectly influenced technological innovativeness via
   proactiveness. This study advances research on organizational
   innovation, ICTs, and interorganizational networks.}},

Abstract = {{The development of low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been
   proposed for many high-impact civilian-centered applications such as
   expanding telecommunication networks in remote locations, improved
   weather monitoring, and terrain surveying. Such missions, which can last
   anywhere from hours to days, rely on efficient, lightweight, and
   high-aspect ratio designs to minimize energy consumption. We investigate
   a method of aerodynamic control that also permits energy harvesting
   through surface texturing on aircraft wings using multifunctional
   kirigami composites. These kirigami skins produce 3D surface features
   when axially strained and have been manufactured using thin-film solar
   cells. Here, we show that when actuated, these 3D features increase the
   drag over the wings, which can be used to control yaw. Wind tunnel
   experiments were conducted to quantify the effects of kirigami actuation
   on aerodynamic lift, drag, and yaw moment. These results demonstrate
   excellent yaw-control capabilities and delayed aerodynamic stall,
   indicating that the actuated kirigami features may delay flow
   separation. The implied multifunctionality of these kirigami skins is
   ideal for low-altitude UAVs, which benefit from both lightweight energy
   sources and actuators.}},

   sought to explore third graders' perceptions of their participation in
   developing, planning, and implementing a critical service-learning
   project. Methodology/Approach: Fieldnotes from classroom observations,
   co-planning and co-teaching sessions, transcripts from student focus
   groups, and other lesson artifacts were analyzed qualitatively.
   Findings/Conclusions: A case study of two third-grade students found
   that amplification of student voice associated with engaging in the
   critical service-learning fostered a sense of community within the
   classroom and increased student self-efficacy. Implications: These
   findings add to the literature on critical service-learning in K-12

Title = {{Deep Layer Kernel Sparse Representation Network for the Detection of
   Heart Valve Ailments from the Time-Frequency Representation of PCG
   Recordings}},
Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},

Abstract = {{The heart valve ailments (HVAs) are due to the defects in the valves of
   the heart and if untreated may cause heart failure, clots, and even
   sudden cardiac death. Automated early detection of HVAs is necessary in
   the hospitals for proper diagnosis of pathological cases, to provide
   timely treatment, and to reduce the mortality rate. The heart valve
   abnormalities will alter the heart sound and murmurs which can be
   faithfully captured by phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings. In this paper,
   a time-frequency based deep layer kernel sparse representation network
   (DLKSRN) is proposed for the detection of various HVAs using PCG
   signals. Spline kernel-based Chirplet transform (SCT) is used to
   evaluate the time-frequency representation of PCG recording, and the
   features like L1-norm (LN), sample entropy (SEN), and permutation
   entropy (PEN) are extracted from the different frequency components of
   the time-frequency representation of PCG recording. The DLKSRN
   formulated using the hidden layers of extreme learning machine- (ELM-)
   autoencoders and kernel sparse representation (KSR) is used for the
   classification of PCG recordings as normal, and pathology cases such as
   mitral valve prolapse (MVP), mitral regurgitation (MR), aortic stenosis
   (AS), and mitral stenosis (MS). The proposed approach has been evaluated
   using PCG recordings from both public and private databases, and the
   results demonstrated that an average sensitivity of 100\%, 97.51\%,
   99.00\%, 98.72\%, and 99.13\% are obtained for normal, MVP, MR, AS, and
   MS cases using the hold-out cross-validation (CV) method. The proposed
   approach is applicable for the Internet of Things- (IoT-) driven smart
   healthcare system for the accurate detection of HVAs.}},

Abstract = {{Microorganisms regulate their interactions with surfaces by altering the
   transcription of specific target genes in response to physicochemical
   surface cues. To assess the influence of surface charge and surface
   chemistry on the transcriptional oxidative stress response, we evaluated
   the expression of three genes, oxyS, katE, and sodB from the
   Gram-negative bacterium, Escherichia coli, after a short exposure to GaN
   interfaces. We observed that both surface charge and surface chemistry
   were the factors regulating the transcriptional response of the target
   genes, which indicates that reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and
   the ROS response at the GaN interfaces were affected by changing surface
   properties. The changes in transcription did not correlate to the
   surface charge in all cases, indicating that there was an influence from
   multiple interfacial properties on the interactions. Alteration of the
   bacterial morphology also was a critical factor in these transcriptional
   responses to the surface cues. When compared to wild-type E. coli
   bacteria, bacteria missing either flagella or curli exhibited altered
   transcriptional profiles of the three oxidative stress genes when
   exposed to GaN materials. These results indicate that the bacterial
   flagella and curli modulated the oxidative stress response in different
   ways. The results of this work add to our understanding of the
   interactions of microbes at interfaces and will be useful for guiding
   the development of electronic biointerfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Avian influenza A (H7N9) viruses emerged in China in 2013 and caused a
   zoonotic disease associated with a high case-fatality ratio of more than
   30\%. Transcriptional profiles obtained using animal models reveal host
   responses to the disease, thereby providing insights into disease
   pathogenesis. Therefore, we aimed to characterize the host responses of
   the H7N9 virus infected-mouse lungs in this study. First, we isolated an
   avian-originated H7N9 strain, which was shown to be highly pathogenic to
   both chickens and mice. Genomic analysis results suggested that a
   12-nucleotide-insertion was present at the hemagglutinin cleavage site,
   and both the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes belonged to the
   Yangtze River Delta lineage. RNA sequencing results revealed 566
   differentially expressed genes in the H7N9-infected lungs. Moreover,
   transcriptome analysis revealed that over-activated antiviral signals
   and intense interferon-stimulated gene products possibly contributed to
   the high virulence of the virus in mice. Importantly, lung
   concentrations of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1 beta
   and interleukin-6, interferon-beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha,
   were upregulated in response to H7N9 virus infection. Overall, the
   present study provided a comprehensive understanding of H7N9 virus
   pathogenicity and correlated host immune responses.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To assess the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on obstetric
   care and outcomes.
   Methods A prospective observational single-center study was performed,
   including all antenatal and parturient women admitted from April to
   August, 2020. Data were collected regarding number of admissions,
   deliveries, antenatal visits, reason for inaccessibility of health care,
   and complications during pregnancy, and compared with data from the
   pre-COVID period of October 2019 to February 2020.
   Results There was a reduction of 45.1\% in institutional deliveries (P <
   0.001), a percentage point increase of 7.2 in high-risk pregnancy, and
   2.5-fold rise in admission to the intensive care unit of pregnant women
   during the pandemic. One-third of women had inadequate antenatal visits.
   The main reason for delayed health-seeking was lockdown and fear of
   contracting infection, resulting in 44.7\% of pregnancies with
   complications. Thirty-two symptomatic women who tested positive for
   COVID-19 were managed at the center with good maternal and fetal
   outcomes.
   Conclusion Although COVID-19 does not directly affect pregnancy
   outcomes, it has indirect adverse effects on maternal and child health.
   Emergency obstetric and antenatal care are essential services to be
   continued with awareness of people while maintaining social distancing
   and personal hygiene.}},

Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{We propose an approach for the characterization of scanning thermal
   microscopy (SThM) probe response using a sample with silicon dioxide
   steps. The chessboard-like sample provides a series of nine surfaces
   made of the same material, with identical roughness, but consisting of
   different thicknesses of silica layers standing on a single silicon
   wafer. The nine regions have different effective thermal conductivities,
   allowing the calibration of SThM probes within a given set of surface
   conditions. A key benefit is the possibility of comparing the spatial
   resolution and the sensitivity to vertical inhomogeneities of the sample
   for different probes. A model is provided to determine the thermal
   contact area and contact thermal resistance from the experimental data.
   The results underline that ballistic heat conduction can be significant
   in crystalline substrates below the top thin films, especially for film
   thicknesses lower than 200nm and effective thermal contact radius lower
   than 200nm. They also highlight the sensitivity of SThM to ultrathin
   films, as well as the substrate below micrometric films under in-air
   conditions but not when in vacuum. This work advances quantitative
   nanometer-scale thermal metrology, where usual photothermal methods are
   more difficult to implement.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ASTHMA}},
Abstract = {{Urban adolescents with asthma often have inadequate preventive care. We
   tested the effectiveness of the School-Based Asthma Care for Teens
   (SB-ACT) program on asthma morbidity and preventive medication
   adherence.
   Methods: Subjects/Setting- 12-16yr olds with persistent asthma in
   Rochester, NY schools. Design- 3-group randomized trial (2014-2019).
   SB-ACT Intervention- Two core components: 1) Directly observed therapy
   (DOT) of preventive asthma medications, provided in school for at least
   6-8 weeks for the teen to learn proper technique and experience the
   benefits of daily preventive therapy; 2) 4-6 weeks later, 3 sessions of
   motivational interviewing (MI) to discuss potential benefits from DOT
   and enhance motivation to take medication independently. We included 2
   comparison groups: 1) DOT-only for 6-8wks, and 2) asthma education (AE)
   attention control. Masked follow-up assessments were conducted at 3, 5,
   and 7mos. Outcomes- Mean number of symptom-free days (SFDs)/2 weeks and
   medication adherence. Analyses- Modified intention-to-treat repeated
   measures analysis.
   Results: We enrolled 430 teens (56\% Black, 32\% Hispanic, 85\%
   Medicaid). There were no group differences at baseline. We found no
   difference in SFDs at any follow-up timepoint. More teens in the SB-ACT
   and DOT-only groups reported having a preventive asthma medication at
   each follow-up (p<.001), and almost daily adherence at 3 and 5-months
   (p<.001, p=.003) compared to AE. By 7 months there were no significant
   differences between groups in adherence (p=.49).
   Conclusion: SB-ACT improved preventive medication availability and
   short-term adherence but did not impact asthma symptoms. Further work is
   needed to create developmentally appropriate and effective interventions
   for this group.}},

Abstract = {{Skin adhesives are used to attach medical devices to the body and are
   required to adhere to the skin also during challenging conditions such
   as exposure to moisture and sweat. In order to maintain good
   skin-adhesive contact in these situations, the adhesives should be able
   to absorb water and remove fluids from the skin-adhesive interface.
   Consequently, the water absorption properties and distribution of water
   in the adhesives influence the overall adhesive properties.
   Understanding how the material composition impacts the absorption and
   distribution of water in these adhesives is required for rational
   formulation of skin adhesives. Here, we probe the dynamic water
   absorption in different skin adhesives using time-resolved impedance
   measurements and gravimetric analysis. Skin adhesive formulations
   consisting of soft, hydrophobic polymers providing stickiness, rigid
   block copolymers enhancing the structure, and hydrogel particles
   allowing for water uptake were designed. The hydrogel particle content
   and polymer matrix rigidity were varied, and the adhesives were
   systematically investigated to link the material composition and water
   absorption functionality.}},

Abstract = {{The practical exploitation of lithium-sulfur batteries is hindered by a
   multitude of obstacles, including sluggish redox kinetics and the
   shuttling of soluble lithium polysulfide (LiPS) during long-term
   cycling. Here, we report the construction of a continuous
   three-dimensional conductive carbon nanofiber supported TiO2-MXene
   heterojunction framework (TM-CNFs) via a one-step
   electrospinning-carbonization strategy, with MXene as the ``energy band
   bridge{''} between the carbon substrate and TiO2 to reduce the barrier
   for electron transfer. Theoretical simulations and experimental tests
   clearly indicate that the TiO2-MXene heterojunction can accelerate the
   mass transfer process of LiPS at the interface. Meanwhile, the
   redistribution of electrons at the heterojunction interfaces accelerates
   the surface electron reversible exchange. Based on the enhanced
   conductivity, the strong chemisorption for LiPS, and the remarkable
   catalysis for the simultaneous conversion of the sulfur species, Li-S
   cells with a flexible TM-CNFs host demonstrate excellent rate
   performance and cycling stability (807.3 mA h g(-1) at 0.5C after 200
   cycles, and 723.3 mA h g(-1) at 1C after 500 cycles), a high areal
   capacity and energy density (10.85 mA h cm(-2) and 1909.86 W h kg(-1) at
   a high sulfur area loading of 10.5 mg cm(-2)), and a high gravimetric
   full-cell energy density over 300 W h kg(-1). The present work provides
   a novel perspective on the design of electrocatalysts for LiPS redox and
   a feasible strategy to improve the electrochemical performance of
   practical lithium-sulfur batteries.}},

Title = {{Sevoflurane preconditioning attenuates hypoxia/reoxygenation injury of
   H9c2 cardiomyocytes by activation of the HIF-1/PDK-1 pathway}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{Background. Sevoflurane preconditioning (SPC) can provide myocardial
   protective effects similar to ischemic preconditioning (IPC). However,
   the underlying molecular mechanism of SPC remains unclear. Studies
   confirm that hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) can transform cells from
   aerobic oxidation to anaerobic glycolysis by activating the switch
   protein pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK-1), thus providing energy
   for the normal life activities of cells under hypoxic conditions. The
   purpose of this study was to investigate whether the cardioprotective
   effects of SPC are associated with activation of the HIF-1a/PDK-1 signal
   pathway.
   Methods. The H9c2 cardiomyocytes hypoxia/reoxygenation model was
   established and treated with 2.4\% sevoflurane at the end of
   equilibration. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, cell viability, cell
   apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential, key enzymes of glycolysis,
   ATP concentration of glycolysis were assessed after the intervention.
   Apoptosis related protein(Bcl-2, Bax), HIF-1a protein, and PDK-1 protein
   were assessed by western blot.
   Results. Compared with the H/R group, SPC significantly increased the
   expression of HIF-1a, PDK-1, and Bcl-2 and reduced the protein
   expression of Bax, which markedly decreased the apoptosis ratio and
   Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, increasing the cell viability,
   content of key enzymes of glycolysis, ATP concentration of glycolysis
   and stabilizing the mitochondrial membrane potential. However, the
   cardioprotective effects of SPC were disappeared by treatment with a
   HIF- 1a selective inhibitor.
   Conclusion. This study demonstrates that the cardioprotective effects of
   SPC are associated with the activation of the HIF-1a/PDK-1 signaling
   pathway. The mechanism may be related to increasing the content of key
   enzymes and ATP of glycolysis in the early stage of hypoxia.}},

Pages = {{9156-9163}},

Abstract = {{An effective signal amplification strategy based on
   temperature-amplification synergistic pressure was designed for the
   sensitive detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) by using a
   noncontact point-of-care testing (POCT) aptasensor with a flexible
   pressure sensor based on a
   poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly-(styrenesulfonate)
   (PEDOT:PSS)-modified sponge (PEDOT:PSSsponge). In the biological
   recognition system, target analyte triggered the release of platinum
   nanoparticle-labeled complementary DNA (Pt-cDNA) from CEA
   aptamer-conjugated magnetic beads. On the basis of the unique
   characteristics of platinum nanoparticles (e.g., catalytic ability for
   H2O2 decomposition, peroxidase-like catalytic activity, and photothermal
   characteristics), the platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) could not only
   catalyze hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to produce a large amount of oxygen
   (O2) but could also assist the oxidation of
   3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to a photothermal agent ox-TMB with
   the increasing temperature. Under 808 nm near-infrared (NIR) laser
   irradiation, an increase in the pressure and temperature occurred
   simultaneously in the closed detection cell. Meanwhile, the increasing
   temperature could be helpful for further increasing the pressure. The
   flexible pressure sensor was compressed in a closed system to cause a
   decrease in contact resistance, thereby establishing a correlation
   between the concentration and the resistance-readable analysis. Under
   optimum conditions, the dynamic detection range of this detection
   strategy for target CEA was between 0.2 and 80 ng mL(-1), and the limit
   of detection (LOD) was 0.15 ng mL(-1). Overall, the signal amplification
   strategy of temperature coordination provides possibilities for the
   future development of sensitive and portable POCT protocols.}},

   studies showed diffuse positivity of epithelial cells for estrogen

Abstract = {{Valuing, managing and conserving marine biodiversity and a full range of
   ecosystem services is at the forefront of research and policy agendas.
   However, biodiversity is being lost at up to a thousand times the
   average background rate. Traditional disciplinary and siloed
   conservation approaches are not able to tackle this massive loss of
   biodiversity because they generally ignore or overlook the interactive
   and dynamic nature of ecosystems processes, limiting their
   predictability. To conserve marine biodiversity, we must assess the
   interactions and impacts among biodiversity and ecosystem services
   (BD-ES). The scaling up in complexity from single species to entire
   communities is necessary, albeit challenging, for a deeper understanding
   of how ecosystem services relate to biodiversity and the roles species
   have in ecosystem service provision. These interactions are challenging
   to map, let alone fully assess, but network and system-based approaches
   provide a powerful way to progress beyond those limitations. Here, we
   introduce a conceptual multi-layered network approach to understanding
   how ecosystem services supported by biodiversity drive the total service
   provision, how different stressors impact BD-ES and where conservation
   efforts should be placed to optimize the delivery of ecosystem services
   and protection of biodiversity. This article is part of the theme issue
   `Integrative research perspectives on marine conservation'.}},

   the mutagenic effects of uracil (U) on ATP aptamer based on the binding

   not only effectively deliver the aptamer probe and tumor therapy but
   also able to analyze the overexpression of APE1 and uracil-DNA
   glycosylases (UDG) in the BER pathway via ATP in situ imaging in tumor
   cells. Therefore, the DNA nanodevices of the BER pathway provide the

Abstract = {{Oryeongsan (ORS), a traditional medicine used to regulate body fluids,
   has a long history of use as a diuretic in Korea, China, and Japan. ORS
   is commonly thought to lower blood pressure, but high-quality data on
   its effects are sparse. The purpose of this study was to determine the
   antihypertensive and renal protective effects of ORS in rats with
   hypertension. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were divided into
   two groups with similar mean baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) and
   diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Then, 10 mL/kg of vehicle (distilled
   water) or 200 mg/kg of ORS extract were administered orally once a day
   for 3 weeks. SBP and DBP were measured at weeks 1, 2, and 3. At the end
   of the experiment, blood was collected, and kidneys were removed for
   histology. By the 2nd and 3rd week after initiation of treatment, the
   ORS-treated group had significantly lower SBP than control-treated rats
   (191.3 +/- 6.5 vs. 206.3 +/- 9.8 mmHg, p = 0.022 at the 2nd week; 195.8
   +/- 7.8 vs. 217.0 +/- 8.1 mmHg, p = 0.003 at the 3rd week,
   respectively). The ORS-treated group trended toward having a lower DBP
   than control, but there was no significant difference. Blood urea
   nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Cr) were not different between the
   ORS-treated and control groups (BUN: 23.7 +/- 1.1 vs. 22.7 +/- 2.8
   mg/dL, p = 0.508; Cr: 19.0 +/- 2.2 vs. 21.6 +/- 2.1 mu M, p = 0.083,
   respectively). The percentage of renal tissue affected by
   tubulointerstitial fibrosis was significantly lower in the ORS-treated
   group (1.68 +/- 0.60) compared to controls (3.17 +/- 0.96, p = 0.019).
   These findings suggest that treatment with ORS reduces SBP and
   ameliorates renal damage in SHR.}},

   Interestingly, by changing only the anion of the starting salt of
   copper(II), Cu(NO3)(2)center dot 3H(2)O instead of CuCl2 center dot
   2H(2)O, an unexpected change in the type of bridge, oxalate (2 and 3)

   architecture. Two polymorphs of 3D coordination polymer
   {[}(CuFe2II)-Fe-II(H2O)(terpy)(C2O4)(3)](n) (4), crystallizing in the
   triclinic (a) and monoclinic (b) space groups, were formed

   hydrothermal conditions iron(III) from initial building block is reduced
   to the divalent state, creating 2D honeycomb
   {[}Fe-2(II)(C2O4)(3)](n)(2n-)- layers, which are bridged by
   {[}Cu(H2O)(terpy)](2+) cations. Compounds were investigated by
   single-crystal X-ray diffraction, IR, and impedance spectroscopies,
   magnetization measurements, and density functional theory (DFT)
   calculations. In compounds 1 and 2, OD magnetism is observed, with 1
   having a ground-state spin of 1 due to different interactions through
   chloride bridges of Cu2+ ions in tetramer {[}Cu-4(II)(terpy)(4)Cl-5](3+)
   and 2 showing strong antiferromagnetic coupling of Cu2+ ions mediated by
   oxalate ligand in {[}Cu-2(II)(H2O)(2)(terpy)(2)(C2O4)](2+) and weak ones
   between Cu2+ and Fe3+ ions through oxalate bridge in

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Thermophilic bacteria are accepted as novel sources of
   exopolysaccharides (EPSs) with different biological activities. This
   study was conducted to test EPS production potential of thermophilic
   bacteria isolated from hot springs in Erzurum province (Turkey), to
   optimize EPS production from the best isolate in molasses medium, to
   characterize the produced EPS, and to investigate its anticancer
   activity.
   RESULTS Among 28 isolates, the best EPS producer isolate was found to be
   Anoxybacillus gonensis YK25 (GenBank No: MN865832). Under optimized
   culture conditions (initial pH 7.0, temperature 55 degrees C, molasses
   concentration 100 mL/L, peptone concentration 6 g/L, and incubation time
   96 h), 4.4 g/L EPS was produced. Molecular weight of EPS was 102 kDa.
   Carbohydrate and protein contents of EPS were 91.4\% and 4.1\%,
   respectively. EPS was a heteropolysaccharide containing xylose (59\%),
   sucrose (18\%), glucose (16\%), and galactose (5\%). It had a high
   solubility in water and a moderate solubility in dimethyl sulfoxide
   (DMSO), but it was insoluble in polar solvents. FTIR analysis confirmed
   the presence of hydroxyl, carboxyl, amide, and sulphate groups. EPS
   showed anticancer activity against SHSY-5Y, HT-29, DU-145, and A-549
   cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. The IC50 values of EPS for A-549,
   DU-145, SHSY-5Y, and HT-29 cancer cells were 5.5, 9.61, 15.62, and 17.35
   mg/mL, respectively.
   CONCLUSION The EPS production potential of A. gonensis, and the
   anticancer activity of the produced EPS were revealed. Furthermore, it
   was shown for the first time that the main monomer of bacterial
   heteropolysaccharides would be xylose. This study indicates that
   Anoxybacillus species may be a novel source of
   pharmaceutically-important EPSs. (c) 2020 Society of Chemical Industry}},

Abstract = {{Here, we demonstrate that the density of oxygen vacancies generated by
   the doped transition metal (TM) ions at the surface of ZnO nanoparticles
   (TM-doped ZnO NPs; TM = Cr or Co) determines the photocatalytic
   degradation (PCD) activity for organic pollutants; to this end, we
   employ multimodal microscopy and spectroscopy that encompass material
   probing at multiple length scales, ranging from the atomic to mesoscale.
   Following the doping treatment of pristine ZnO NPs as a post-synthetic
   process, Cr ion doping leads to a significant enhancement of the PCD
   activity of the ZnO NPs, whereas Co ion doping results in a negative
   effect. Atomic-scale observations and site-specific spectroscopy confirm
   that these two TM ions substitute for Zn, in different valence states
   (Cr3+ and Co2+, respectively), without inducing a phase change of the
   host ZnO matrix (wurtzite structure). Cr-doped ZnO NPs have the highest
   density of oxygen vacancies originating from charge mismatch, which
   contributes to a notably enhanced PCD effect on the tested pollutants,
   whereas the other two samples (pristine and Co-doped ones) have similar
   amounts of oxygen vacancies. Our multimodal and multiscale spectroscopic
   probing provides a clear insight into the significant role of charge
   mismatch, induced by the substitution of the host cation by the doped
   cation, in controlling the oxygen vacancies. This can serve as a
   practical guideline for atomically precise control of oxygen vacancies
   toward the development of high-performance metal oxide photocatalysts.}},

Abstract = {{Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as promising candidates for
   a wide range of applications due to their high surface area and
   customizable structures, however, the minimal external hydrophilicity of
   MOFs has limited their biomedical implementations. Structuring of MOFs
   within polymer frameworks is an approach used to create hybrid materials
   that retain many of the MOF characteristics (e.g. high adsorption
   capacity) but expand the range of mechanical and surface properties as
   well as form factors accessible. Using this approach, hybridizing MOFs
   with hydrophilic hydrogels can give rise to materials with improved
   hydrophilicity and biocompatibility. Here, we describe the synthesis of
   the first Zr-based MOF-hydrogel hybrid material (composite 3) using a
   green chemistry approach, in which only water was used as the solvent
   and relatively low temperature (50 degrees C) was applied. Using
   methylene blue (MB) as a probe molecule, composite 3 exhibited greater
   adsorption capacity than the MOF or the hydrogel alone in aqueous
   solution at most tested pH values (all except pH 13). At an initial MB
   concentration of 0.0096 mg mL(-1) (30.014 mu M) and neutral pH

Abstract = {{In high-latitude ecosystems bryophytes are important drivers of
   ecosystem functions. Alterations in abundance of mosses due to global
   change may thus strongly influence carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling
   and hence cause feedback on climate. The effects of mosses on soil
   microbial activity are, however, still poorly understood. Our study aims
   at elucidating how and by which mechanisms bryophytes influence
   microbial decomposition processes of soil organic matter and thus soil
   nutrient availability.
   We present results from a field experiment in a subarctic birch forest
   in northern Sweden, where we partly removed the moss cover and replaced
   it with an artificial soil cover for simulating moss effects on soil
   temperature and moisture. We combined this with a fertilization
   experiment with N-15-labelled N for analysing the effects of moss N
   sequestration on soil processes.
   Our results demonstrate the capacity of mosses to reduce soil N
   availability and retard N cycling. The comparison with artificial soil
   cover plots suggests that the effect of mosses on N cycling is linked to
   the thermal insulation capacity of mosses causing low average soil
   temperature in summer and strongly reduced soil temperature
   fluctuations, the latter also leading to a decreased frequency of
   freeze-thaw events in autumn and spring. Our results also showed,
   however, that the negative temperature effect of mosses on soil
   microbial activity was in part compensated by stimulatory effects of the
   moss layer, possibly linked to leaching of labile substrates from the
   moss. Furthermore, our results revealed that bryophytes efficiently
   sequester added N from wet deposition and thus prevent effects of
   increased atmospheric N deposition on soil N availability and soil
   processes.
   Synthesis. Our study emphasizes the important role of mosses in carbon
   and nutrient cycling in high-latitude ecosystems and the potential
   strong impacts of reductions in moss abundance on microbial
   decomposition processes and nutrient availability in subarctic and
   boreal forests.}},

Title = {{Pickled olives neutralize vicine and convicine glycosides in Vicia faba
   and protect from favism}},
Journal = {{NUTRITION \& FOOD SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{959-973}},
Month = {{AUG 4}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   This paper aims to evaluate hematological parameters, blood glutathione
   (GSH), serum glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6-PD) and liver
   function in favism animals' models after oral intake with a mixture of
   pickled olives and Vicia faba (V. faba) seeds.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Favism is a life-threatening hemolytic crisis. It results from the
   ingestion of V. faba by the individuals. The hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit
   (Hct), red blood cells (RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), serum glucose,
   blood GSH, serum G6-PD, serum thiobarbaturic acid reactive substances
   (TBARS), liver protein and liver function were evaluated after oral
   administration with a mixture of pickled olives with V. faba seeds in
   favism animals' models.
   Findings
   The favism-, vicine- and convicine-treated animals showed a significant
   decrease (p < 0.01) in Hb (6.42, 7.23 and 5.96 g/dl), Hct (25.4, 26.4
   and 25.1\%), RBCs (2.56, 2.45 and 2.60 106 cells/mm(3), WBCs (4.35, 4.25
   and 4.30 103 cells/mm(3)), serum glucose (95.8, 97.1 and 96.5 mg/dl),
   blood GSH (24.7, 26.6 and 23.8 mg/dl), serum G6-PD (15.8, 15.9 and 15.7
   U/L), serum aspartate aminotransferase (6.35, 6.59 and 5.97 U/L),
   alanine aminotransferase (4.49, 4.61 and 4.50 U/L), total protein (6.54,
   6.59 and 6.40 g/dl), albumin (3.84, 3.91 and 3.75 g/dl), globulin (2.70,
   2.48 and 2.65 g/dl) and liver protein (3.37, 3.10 and 3.42 g/g tissue)
   but a significant increase (p < 0.01) in serum TBARS (38.7, 38.9 and
   39.4 nmol/dl), alkaline phosphatase (275, 271 and 281 U/L) and total
   bilirubin (0.93, 0.89 and 0.91 mg/dl) compared to Hb (16.3 g/dl), Hct
   (45.3\%), RBCs (5.80 106 cells/mm(3)), WBCs (9.45 103 cells/mm(3)),
   serum glucose (96.5 mg/dl), blood GSH (39.7 mg/dl), serum G6-PD (36.1
   U/L), serum TBARS (18.0 nmol/dl), serum aspartate aminotransferase (19.8
   U/L), alanine aminotransferase (9.23 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (214
   U/L), total bilirubin (0.57 mg/dl), total protein (8.76 g/dl), albumin
   (4.85 g/dl), globulin (3.91 g/dl) and liver protein (6.28 g/g tissue) in
   control group. The oral administration with pickled olives + V. faba,
   pickled olives + vicine and pickled olives + convicine into favism
   animals' models, vicine-treated animals and convicine-treated animals,
   respectively pushed all the above-mentioned parameters to near the
   control levels.
   Originality/value
   V. faba contains vicine and convicine glycosides. Vicine and convicine
   glycosides in V. faba are hydrolyzed by intestinal microflora to
   aglycones divicine and isouramil, respectively. Divicine and isouramil
   are highly reactive compounds generating free radicals where divicine
   and isouramil are the main factors of favism. The ss-glucosidase in
   pickled olives converts both vicine and convicine glycosides into
   aglycones divicine and isouramil, respectively, in aerobic condition
   outside the human body (in inactive forms) and prevent these glycosides
   to cause favism.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon nitrides constitute a class of earth-abundant polymeric
   semiconductors, which have high potential for tunability on a molecular
   level, despite their high chemical and thermal inertness. Here the first
   postsynthetic modification of the 2D carbon nitride poly(heptazine
   imide) (PHI) is reported, which is decorated with terminal melamine
   (Mel) moieties by a functional group interconversion. The covalent
   attachment of this group is verified based with a suite of spectroscopic
   and microscopic techniques supported by quantum-chemical calculations.
   Using triethanolamine as a sacrificial electron donor, Mel-PHI
   outperforms most other carbon nitrides in terms of hydrogen evolution
   rate (5570 mu mol h(-1) g(-1)), while maintaining the intrinsic light
   storing properties of PHI. The origin of the observed superior
   photocatalytic performance is traced back to a modified surface
   electronic structure and enhanced interfacial interactions with the
   amphiphile triethanolamine, which imparts improved colloidal stability
   to the catalyst particles especially in contrast to methanol used as
   donor. However, this high activity can be limited by oxidation products
   of donor reversibly building up at the surface, thus blocking active
   centers. The findings lay out the importance of surface
   functionalization to engineer the catalyst-solution interface, an
   underappreciated tuning parameter in photocatalytic reaction design.}},

Abstract = {{Since influenza occurs globally every year, it is important to develop a
   facile and accurate method to detect the influenza virus. This study
   aimed at developing a sensitive fluorometric assay for detecting
   influenza viral RNA through tandem gene amplification methods including
   reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), followed by strand displacement
   amplification (SDA) coupled with rolling circle amplification (RCA).
   Influenza viral RNA was initially amplified by RT-PCR with a tailed
   reverse primer containing an additional sequence for SDA. The RT-PCR
   amplicon was then subjected to SDA, yielding multiple copies of
   single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that can be used as a primer for subsequent
   RCA. Thereafter, a long ssDNA segment harboring tandem repeated
   G-quadruplexes that were generated through RCA was intercalated by
   Thioflavin T, yielding a strong fluorescence signal indicating the
   presence of the target viral RNA. Fluorometric analysis detected
   influenza viral RNA ranging from 50 pg to 500 pg with a limit of
   detection of 6.2 pg with a signal-to-background ratio of 10 and
   identified each influenza virus strain (H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B).
   Thus, the present method for the label-free fluorometric detection of
   viral RNA via tandem gene amplifications combining RT-PCR-coupled SDA
   and G-quadruplex-generating RCA would facilitate the efficient diagnosis

Abstract = {{Due to the features of event-triggered control in exploiting and saving
   system resources, they have been widely applied in sensor networks,
   multi-agent systems, networked control systems and so on. In this study,
   the authors focused on robust event-triggered distributed model
   predictive control (RETDMPC). Subject to disturbances and parametric
   uncertainties, they first applied the min-max model to RETDMPC. The
   min-max RETDMPC methodology is used to guarantee the robustness of the
   system state by taking the worst possible case of unknown uncertainties
   into consideration. Furthermore, in this framework, a new cost function
   is developed in which unknown uncertainties are considered. Next,
   sufficient conditions are provided to ensure the feasibility and
   stability of their developed min-max RETDMPC. Finally, a practical
   example is given to illustrate the advantages of their algorithm by
   comparing to the conventional model predictive control.}},

Abstract = {{A fault diagnosis framework based on extreme learning machine (ELM) and
   AdaBoost.SAMME is proposed in a nuclear power plant (NPP) in this paper.
   After briefly describing the principles of ELM and AdaBoost.SAMME
   algorithm, the fault diagnosis framework sets ELM algorithm as the weak
   classifier and then integrates several weak classifiers into a strong
   one using the AdaBoost.SAMME algorithm. Furthermore, some experiments
   are put forward for the setting of two algorithms. The results of
   simulation experiments on the HPR1000 simulator show that the combined
   method has higher precision and faster speed by improving the
   performance of weak classifiers compared to the BP neural network and
   verify the feasibility and validity of the ensemble learning method for
   fault diagnosis. Meanwhile, the results also indicate that the proposed
   method can meet the requirements of a real-time diagnosis of the nuclear

Abstract = {{In this study, a 60-day feeding trial was conducted to determine the
   effects of feed supplementating the feed of Apostichopus japonicus with
   peptides on its growth, energy budget, body composition and immune
   responses. Sea cucumbers were fed with five experimental diets
   supplemented with different proportions of peptides: 0 (D1), 12.5 (D2),
   25 (D3), 37.5 (D4) and 50 (D5) g/kg in basal diet. Our results suggested
   that specific growth rate (SGR) and ratio of viscera to body wall (RVBW)
   of sea cucumbers fed with D4 were significantly improved. Relative to
   D1, ingestion rate (IR) and faeces production rate (FPR) for D3 and D4
   were reduced considerably. Notably, the energy intake increased when
   peptide level increased from 0 to 50 g/kg. Meanwhile, the energy
   deposited for growth increased, and the energy loss decreased when
   peptide level increased from 0 to 37.5 g/kg. The sea cucumbers in D4 had
   the highest level of crude fat and lowest crude ash. The activities of
   immunoenzyme, such as SOD, CAT, T-AOC, ACP and AKP, increased with
   peptide increase. Results suggested that supplementation of the feed

Abstract = {{The use of high-performance heterogeneous photocatalysts for
   photoinduced electron/energy transfer-reversible addition-fragmentation
   chain transfer (PET-RAFT) polymerization is promising for providing
   enhanced activity, longevity and recyclability for controlled radical
   polymerization reactions as compared with homogeneous photocatalysts.
   However, the majority of existing heterogeneous photocatalyst systems
   for PET-RAFT polymerization suffer from structural instability or poor
   oxygen tolerance. In this contribution, interpenetrating polymer
   networks bearing eosin Y photocatalysts (IPN-GEY gels) are designed and
   synthesized through two orthogonal crosslinking reactions, i.e.
   epoxy-amine ring-opening polymerization and free radical polymerization.
   This gel system delivers two intrinsic merits: structural robustness
   owing to the IPN networks, as well as excellent oxygen tolerance enabled
   by the presence of tertiary amines. By manipulating the initial solution
   pH, we were able to toggle the polymerization kinetics using both
   solution pH and light as external triggers. Moreover, control over
   molecular variables and oxygen tolerance was realized for IPN-GEY gel
   mediated PET-RAFT polymerization using myriads of monomer formulations
   and reaction media. Demonstrations of the syntheses of block copolymers
   and protein-polymer bioconjugates in tandem with catalyst-recycling
   tests further point out the toughness and performance of these IPN-GEY
   systems. The IPN-GEY gels thus show great promise to tackle challenging
   tasks concerning green, precise and efficient polymerization.}},

Abstract = {{Antibiotic resistance is a global threat to modern society. Rapid
   determination of suitable antibiotics that inhibit bacterial growth can
   effectively reduce antibiotic resistance and improve clinical treatment.
   The conventional methods of antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST)
   depend on optical density measurements, which require long-time
   incubation. Various kinds of rapid AST systems which utilize various
   technologies from the field of lab on a chip have promised a great
   reduction in measurement time, but cannot achieve high-throughput,

   we introduce a capillary and centrifuge-based rapid AST system that
   reduces the time of loading the sample and culture media while achieving
   a high-throughput testing capacity. The capability of the proposed
   system is validated in a systematic analysis that includes sample
   loading characteristics and AST trials with standard strains. The
   proposed system provides a useful tool for drug testing in cell-culture

Abstract = {{1. Zhenwu Tang (ZWT) is a traditional Chinese medicine that is primarily
   composed of Radix Aconiti Lateralis Praeparata (FZ) and diterpenoid
   alkaloids are believed to be the pharmacologically active compounds of
   ZWT. In this study, the pharmacokinetic profiles of hypaconitine,
   mesaconitine, aconitine, benzoylmesaconitine, benzoylaconitine, and
   benzoylhypacoitine were assessed in rats following intragastric ZWT
   administration. Furthermore, differences in the pharmacokinetic profiles
   of these six alkaloids were assessed as a function of rat sex and the
   administration of ZWT or FZ extracts to these animals. Plasma levels of
   these alkaloids were quantified via HPLC-MS/MS.
   2. Significant differences in key pharmacokinetic parameters were
   observed when comparing rats administered FZ or ZWT. Relative to FZ
   extract treatment, ZWT administration was associated with C-max and
   AUC(0-infinity) values of benzoylmesaconitine that were about 3.5 and
   5.5 times higher. Considerable variations in hypaconitine
   pharmacokinetic parameters were also revealed between female and male
   rats. The C-max and AUC(0-infinity) of hypaconitine were about 2.5- and
   2.7-fold elevated in female rats in comparison with male rats.
   3. These results suggested that the other compounds within ZWT can
   enhance the absorption of benzoylmesaconitine, while hypaconitine
   exhibits higher bioavailability in female rats, as compared with male
   rats.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an Electric Vehicle (EV) aggregator bidding strategy
   in the reserve market. The EV aggregator determines the
   charging/discharging operations of EVs in providing reserve service for
   profits maximization. In the Day-Ahead Market (DAM), the EV aggregator
   submits a bidding plan to the Independent Systems Operator (ISO)
   including base-load and reserve up/down capacities plans. In the
   Real-Time Market (RTM), the EV aggregator should deploy reserve based on
   the ISO's requirements, and the EV aggregator could receive income by
   deploying reserve or penalty for reserve shortage. The stochastic
   programming method is applied to address the uncertain reserve
   deployment requirements in RTM. In addition, Energy Storage Systems
   (ESS) are utilized by the EV aggregator to enhance the ability in
   providing reserve service. The aggregator-owner contract is designed to
   guarantee EV owners' economic benefits. Case studies show the expected
   profits of the EV aggregator are maximized and the risk of the reserve
   shortage is well managed, i.e., penalty is minimized. With the
   utilization of ESS, the performance of the EV aggregator in making
   response to the ISO's requirements is improved. That is, the required
   reserve percentage increases from 5.68\% to 7.85\%, and the deployed
   reserve percentage increases from 69.71\% to 88.47\%.}},

Abstract = {{Using the potentiodynamic polarization analysis, the fatigue crack
   propagation behavior of A7N01P-T4 aluminum alloy metal inert gas welded
   joints cut from a high-speed train underframe after 1.8 million km
   operation was studied in air and in a 3.5 wt\% NaCl solution. The
   fracture surface and crack growth path were analyzed using optical
   microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and electron backscattered
   diffraction. The results reveal that the corrosion fatigue crack growth
   rate of an A7N01P-T4 welded joint in a 3.5 wt\% NaCl solution is higher
   than that in air. Furthermore, the corrosion fatigue crack growth rate
   is noted to be the fastest in the heat-affected zone, followed by the
   base metal, whereas it is the slowest in the weld metal, which is
   consistent with the corrosion resistance of the A7N01P-T4 joints. The
   second phase is observed to exhibit a significant influence on the
   corrosion fatigue crack propagation path. The cracks are noted to grow
   toward the soft orientation and have obvious plastic deformation during
   the propagation process, which indicates that the anodic dissolution is
   the main cause of the corrosion fatigue crack growth.}},

Abstract = {{Imperatorin (IMP) exhibits a variety of pharmacological properties,
   including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, anti-cancer,
   and anti-hypertension activities. However, its effects on animal
   reproduction systems, especially oocyte development, maturation, and
   aging are not yet clear. In this study, the effects of IMP on oocyte
   development and aging as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms
   were explored. Oocytes were cultured for an additional 24 h for aging.
   Results revealed that the blastocyst formation and hatching rates of
   embryos, which were parthenogenetically activated aged oocytes, were
   significantly increased with IMP treatment (40 mu M). Simultaneously,
   well-distributed cortical granules but no significant difference in zona
   pellucida hardness were observed after IMP treatment. During this stage,
   intracellular reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, and autophagy levels
   were decreased, while mitochondrial membrane potential, glutathione
   level, and activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase were increased.
   IMP-treated aged oocytes also showed significantly higher expression of
   MOS, CCNB1, BMP15, and GDF9 than non-IMP-treated aged oocytes although
   their levels were still lower than those in the fresh oocytes. These
   results suggest that IMP can effectively ameliorate the quality of aged
   porcine oocytes by reducing oxidative stress and protecting
   mitochondrial function.}},

Abstract = {{WO3 with a mixed phase (m-WO3 and h-WO3) was synthesized by facile
   hydrothermal and annealing methods using biomass carbon (Hemp stems) as
   a sacrificial template. The biomorphic hierarchical structure
   effectively enhanced the dispersion of WO3 microspheres, which increased
   the contact area for the target gas molecule. The control of the mixed
   phase compositions was achieved by space confinement of biomass carbon
   and heat treatments. The synergistic effect of the mixed phase increased
   the mobility of carriers and promoted the separation and transport of
   electrons and holes. Thus, it improved the adsorption-diffusion capacity
   of NO2 molecules and enhanced the sensor performance at lower operating
   temperature effectively. The B-WO3-04 (450 degrees C, 4 h) exhibited an
   ultra-high response (R-a/R-g = 71.07) towards 100 ppm NO2 gas with
   excellent repeatability and appreciable long-term stability at room
   temperature. The significant improvement of B-WO3-04 gas sensing
   performance was mainly due to its unique hierarchical structure and the
   optimal proportion of the mixed phase composition.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to improve the yield of fermented Tremella
   polysaccharide (FTP) by optimizing the medium and to explore the effect
   of optimization on the structure. In this paper, the Plackett-Burman
   design and response surface method were used to optimize the
   fermentation medium of Tremella spore GT2\# for FTP production. The
   results of the Plackett-Burman design showed that potato extract,
   glucose, and peptone were the main factors. The Box-Behnken experiment
   and regression analysis determined that the optimal concentrations of
   potato extract, glucose, and peptone were 22.01\%, 29.38 g/L, and 2.61
   g/L, respectively. After optimization, the fermentation period shortened
   from 5 days to 3 days, and the yield of FTP increased from 10.75 g/L to
   12.50 g/L, which was in good agreement with the predicted value (12.36
   g/L). Characterization of FTP obtained before and after optimization was
   carried out, and the results showed that medium optimization had
   significant effects on the primary structure of FTP, including molecular
   weight, monosaccharide composition, and proportion. After optimization,
   the content of acid polysaccharide increased, and the glycoside bonds
   changed from a-configuration to ss-configuration.}},

Abstract = {{Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is arguably the most important
   tool for atomic-scale material characterization. A significant portion
   of the energy of transmitted electrons is transferred to the material
   under study through inelastic scattering, causing inadvertent damage via
   ionization, radiolysis, and heating. In particular, heat generation
   complicates TEM observations as the local temperature can affect
   material properties. Here, the heat generation due to electron
   irradiation is quantified using both top-down and bottom-up approaches:
   direct temperature measurements using nanowatt calorimeters as well as
   the quantification of energy loss due to inelastic scattering events
   using electron energy loss spectroscopy. Combining both techniques, a
   microscopic model is developed for beam-induced heating and to identify
   the primary electron-to-heat conversion mechanism to be associated with
   valence electrons. Building on these results, the model provides
   guidelines to estimate temperature rise for general materials with
   reasonable accuracy. This study extends the ability to quantify thermal
   impact on materials down to the atomic scale.}},

Abstract = {{Detection of methanol in commercial biodiesel is essential to evaluate
   the fuel quality associated with the matter of driving safety. Compared
   to the standard GC method, the fluorescent detection method for methanol
   is much simpler and faster, but still uncompetitive due to its low
   sensitivity. In this respect, we herein reported two flavonoid-based
   solvatofluorochromic probes by extending conjugation length to regulate
   the transition dipole moments, ensuring adequate detection sensitivities
   and discriminable fluorescent color change towards trace amounts of
   methanol in biodiesel. Spectroscopic studies revealed that the detection
   sensitivities of both probes were high and the detection limit for
   methanol in biodiesel could reach 0.041\%, meeting the requirement of
   the commercial testing standard. The detection methods for methanol
   based on the above-mentioned probes were proven to be fast, stable and
   with acceptable veracity and reproducibility, especially suited for
   practical applications. This feasible design strategy by rationally
   regulating the transition dipole moments to tune the sensitivity of
   probes may inspire more related studies in the future.}},

Title = {{Fine-tuning of localized surface plasmon resonance of metal
   nanostructures from near-Infrared to blue prepared by nanosphere
   lithography}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{Plasmonics using metal nanoparticles (MNPs) has emerged as an important
   research subject in the field of photonics, electronics, and
   nanotechnology. Despite spectacular progress in recent years, accurate
   tuning and modeling of plasmon resonances over a wide spectral range
   using state-of-the-art fabrication methods are still challenging tasks.
   Here, we report on the fine-tuning of the localized surface plasmon
   resonance (LSPR) of metal nanoparticles over a wide spectral range from
   near-infrared to blue using nanosphere lithography (NSL). In this
   systematic study, we use NSL to fabricate triangular shaped metal
   nanostructures using gold, silver, copper, and aluminum. All structures
   were annealed up to 500 degrees C under a nitrogen atmosphere in order
   to study the effect of annealing on the LSPR. Structural changes were
   investigated using scanning electron microscopy and atomic force
   microscopy. UV-VIS spectroscopy was used to determine the LSPR spectral
   position for these structures. The LSPR peak position is ordered as
   copper, gold, silver, and aluminum (from low to high photon
   energy-ranging from near-infrared to blue). The rate at which the LSPR
   changes with respect to the increasing annealing temperature is
   determined to be (2.3 +/- 0.3)nm/degrees C and (1.3 +/- 0.1)nm/degrees C
   for Ag and Au, respectively, while Cu MNPs show a two-step relation with
   a steeper slope of (1.4 +/- 0.3)nm/degrees C initially up to 275 degrees
   C followed by a shallower slope of (0.5 +/- 0.1)nm/degrees C. The full
   width at half maximum of the LSPR increases from gold over silver and
   copper to aluminum. We also performed finite element method simulations
   to validate the experimental findings. Our results can have a
   significant impact in plasmonic applications where fine-tuning and
   accurate designing of the LSPR are important.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this retrospective study was to review the results of a
   4-year audit performed on anesthetic machines and vaporizers used in
   veterinary clinics in Spain and Portugal. Data was collected between
   July 2016 and April 2020. Inspections were carried out by a team of
   seven veterinarians, using a human-modified system of checks that was
   adapted to a veterinary practice. The evaluation of each item was noted
   as ``correct{''} or ``incorrect{''}. The vaporizers' performance was
   evaluated using a self-calibrating gas analyzer. The vaporizer was
   classified as ``correct{''} or ``incorrect{''} when the vaporization
   error was less than or equal to, or more than 20\%, respectively. The
   anesthetic machine was classified as ``conforming{''} if all its
   components were noted as ``correct{''} and no leaks were detected, or as
   ``non-conforming{''} if any of the components was noted as
   ``incorrect{''} or if a leak was detected. If the inspector was able to
   repair on-site the item malfunctions detected and the machine was fit
   for use, they issued a final report as ``conforming.{''} On the
   contrary, if such malfunctions persisted, the final report was
   ``non-conforming,{''} and a recommendation to remove the machine from
   service until its final repair was provided. To perform statistical
   analysis, each inspected item was used as predictor, classification and
   regression trees were built, and a random forest analysis was performed.
   A total of 2,001 anesthetic machines and 2,309 vaporizers were studied.
   After inspection, 42.7 and 26.4\% of the machines were non-conforming
   and conforming, respectively, whereas 30.9\% could be repaired in situ.
   A total of 27.1\% of the isoflurane vaporizers and 35.9\% of the
   sevoflurane vaporizers were incorrect. Machine learning techniques
   showed that the most important variables in the classification of the
   anesthetic machines as conforming or non-conforming were mostly the
   scavenger system and the canister, followed some way behind by the APL
   valve, source of oxygen, reservoir bag, vaporizer, and connections.}},

Title = {{Adaptive noise reduction for dual-energy x-ray imaging based on spatial
   variations in beam attenuation}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{Purpose. The main goal of this work is to improve the previously
   proposed patient-specific pixel-based dual-energy (PP-DE) algorithm by
   developing an adaptive anti-correlated noise reduction (ACNR) method,
   resulting in reduced image noise. Methods. Theoretical models of
   contrast-to-noise (CNR) and signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio were developed
   as functions of weighting factors for DE bone omega(Bn) or soft tissue
   omega(ST) cancellation. These analytical expressions describe CNR and
   SNR properties of dual-energy (DE) images, obtained with both simple log
   subtraction (SLS) and ACNR algorithms, and allow for a direct comparison
   between experimental and theoretical results. The theoretical models
   demonstrate the importance of ACNR weighting factor (omega(A))
   optimization leading to the maximization of the SNR of the final image.
   A step phantom was constructed, which consisted of overlapping slabs of
   solid water (0-30 cm) and bone-mimicking material (0-6 cm), resulting in
   a total of 7 x 7 regions. High-energy (HE) and low-energy (LE) images
   were acquired at 140 kVp and 60 kVp with a clinical ExacTrac imaging
   system. The CNR and SNR were obtained for the DE images as functions of
   omega(Bn,ST) and noise reduction weighting factor omega(A) for different
   combinations of thicknesses. Weighting factors for bone cancellation
   were optimized for each region of interest (ROI) by finding zeros of CNR
   function for DE images between soft tissue only and soft tissue plus
   bone regions (and vice versa for soft tissue cancellation). The
   weighting factor for the ACNR algorithm omega(A) was then optimized by
   maximizing the SNR function for each ROI. HE and LE images for an
   anthropomorphic Rando phantom were obtained with the same acquisition
   parameters as for the step phantom. DE images for bone only and soft
   tissue only were obtained with three algorithms: SLS and PP-DE with
   conventional ACNR (uniform omega(A)), and PP-DE with adaptive ACNR
   (region-varying omega(A)). Weighting factor maps for PP-DE and adaptive
   ACNR methods were obtained for Rando phantom geometry (which was
   determined from its CT scans) by interpolation (or extrapolation) of
   weighting factors for the step phantom. CNR values were calculated for
   different regions. Results. The CNR and SNR characteristics as functions
   of material cancellation and noise reduction weighting factors were
   obtained from theoretical models and experimental data from the step
   phantom. This showed a good qualitative validation of the models. For
   the ANCR algorithm, both the theory and experiment demonstrated that the
   material cancellation weighting factors (omega(Bn,ST)) can be optimized
   independently of the noise cancellation weighting factors (omega(A)),
   which can be optimized by maximizing SNR. For each ROI (with different
   overlapping bone and soft tissue thicknesses) the weighting factors
   omega(Bn,ST) were determined as well as corresponding optimal weighting
   factors omega(A) for noise reduction. For the Rando phantom, CNR values
   for regions representing different anatomical structures (ribs, spine,
   and tumor) were evaluated. It was shown that the proposed adaptive ACNR
   further improves image quality, compared to the conventional ACNR
   algorithm. The improvement is maximized for regions with bones (ribs or
   spine), where the largest attenuation is observed. Conclusion.
   The ACNR weighting factors are dependent on the material thicknesses due
   to varying beam attenuation leading to different levels of quantum
   noise.
   This was shown with the derived theoretical expressions of the CNR and
   SNR functions and was validated by experimental data. The adaptive ANCR
   DE algorithm was developed, which allows for an increase in image
   quality by spatially varying weighting factors for noise reduction. This
   algorithm complements the previously developed PP-DE algorithm to obtain
   better quality DE images.}},

   revision of the genus is here presented. Based on more than 2,600
   herbarium specimens including collections over 200 years, Elaphoglossum
   is the second most diversified fern genus in Madagascar, with 52 species
   and three subspecies (with 76\% of endemism). It is to be compared to
   the 34 species treated by Tardieu-Blot in 1960 for the ``Flore de
   Madagascar et des Comores{''} or the 38 species listed by Roux in 2009
   in the seminal ``Synopsis of the Lycopodiophyta and Pteridophyta of
   Africa, Madagascar and neighboring islands{''}. The 55 taxa represent
   five out of seven existing generic sections (sect. Amygdalifolia and
   sect. Wrightiana being monotypic and Neotropical): sect. Lepidoglossa
   (29 spp. and three subspp.), sect. Elaphoglossum (17 spp.), sect. Setosa
   (3 spp.), sect. Squamipedia (2 spp.), and sect. Polytrichia (1 sp.).
   Distribution is given for each species and subspecies, and detailed for
   each island or archipelago in the Western Indian Ocean (La Reunion,
   Mauritius, Seychelles, and Comoros ). Twenty species and three
   subspecies are newly described, all but one endemic to Madagascar:
   Elaphoglossum ambrense Rouhan, Elaphoglossum andohahelense Rouhan,
   Elaphoglossum anjanaharibense Rouhan, Elaphoglossum approximatum Rouhan,
   Elaphoglossum brachymischum Rouhan, Elaphoglossum cerussatum Tardieu
   subsp. brunneum Rouhan, Elaphoglossum coracinolepis Rouhan,
   Elaphoglossum desireanum Rouhan, Elaphoglossum glabricaule Rouhan,
   Elaphoglossum gladiifolium Rouhan, Elaphoglossum leucolepis (Baker)
   Krajina ex Tardieu subsp. nanolepis Rouhan, Elaphoglossum leucolepis

Abstract = {{The effects of molecular weight and thermal history on the partial
   melting of polyethylene (PE) were investigated by in-situ small-angle
   X-ray scattering (SAXS) and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD)
   techniques. In the partial melting process, both surface melting and
   melting of small lamellae were found to play prominent roles. However,
   in some cases that could not be explained by these mechanisms, the
   concept of ``non-lamellar crystalline{''} (NLC) was proposed. We argue
   that melting of the NLC domains can also contribute to the partial
   melting, especially at low temperatures. The event would decrease the
   crystallinity but does not perturb the lamellar structure, which are not
   seen in surface melting and melting of small lamellae. Upon further
   heating, structural changes, including the extension of lamellar length
   and reduction of lamellar width, were also observed. The experimental
   results in the temperature range dominated by the surface melting
   mechanism could be described by the model proposed by Albrecht and
   Strobl.}},

Abstract = {{Fabrication of highly dense conical nanostructures and their subsequent
   controlled metallization make them ideal candidates for enhancing cold
   cathode electron emission efficiency. For instance, hierarchical growth
   of self-assembled noble metal nanoparticles on self-organized
   nanostructured materials offers the advantage of fabricating low
   threshold cold cathode electron emitters. However, the fabrication of
   stable Si nanostructure-based cold cathode electron emitters with
   ultra-low threshold fields is a challenging task. This report presents
   cold cathode electron emission from Au-NP-decorated ensembles of
   self-organized silicon nanofacets (Si-NFs) having fascinating ultralow
   turn-on fields (as low as 0.27 V mu m(-1)) and remarkably low threshold
   electric fields (as low as 0.37 V mu m(-1)) with outstanding stability.
   It is interesting to note that even as-prepared Si-NFs offer hitherto
   unseen low turn-on fields (as low as 0.58 V mu m(-1)) and threshold
   electric fields (0.66 V mu m(-1)) - so far as silicon-based
   nanostructures are concerned. Kelvin probe force microscopy studies
   reveal that tunability in the work function of Au-NP-decorated Si-NF
   samples depends on the dimension and growth-angle of gold nanoparticles
   (Au-NPs). In addition, in-depth dual pass tunnelling current microscopy
   measurements demonstrate that the Au-NPs on the apexes and sidewalls of
   Si-NFs act as cold cathode electron emission sites which help to improve
   the turn-on and threshold fields for Au-NP-decorated Si-NFs in
   comparison to their as-prepared counterparts where electron emission
   takes place mostly from their sidewalls and valleys. Furthermore, finite
   element electrostatic field-based simulations reinforce the experimental
   observations. The present investigation paves the pathway to the
   fabrication of self-organized Si nanostructure-based highly stable cold
   cathode electron emitting devices having fascinating low turn-on and
   threshold fields along with extremely high field enhancement factors and
   high stability for use in nanoscale electronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is a rate-limiting enzyme
   for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) synthesis and is involved in
   cancer cell proliferation through regulation of energy production
   pathways. Therefore, NAMPT inhibitors are promising drugs for cancer
   therapy by limiting energy supply of tumours. Herein, we demonstrated
   that the NAMPT inhibitor FK866
   ((E)-N-(4-(1-Benzoylpiperidin-4-yl)butyl)-3-(pyridin-3-yl)acrylamide)
   dose-dependently inhibited growth and cell motility of DU-145 prostate
   tumour spheroids and decreased the intracellular ATP concentration. The
   apoptosis marker cleaved caspase-3 remained unchanged, but the autophagy
   marker microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3) was
   upregulated. Growth inhibition was reversed upon co-administration of
   NAD to the cell culture medium. FK866 decreased calcein as well as
   pheophorbide A efflux from tumour spheroids and increased doxorubicin
   toxicity, indicating interference with function of drug efflux
   transporters. DU-145 multicellular tumour spheroids expressed the stem
   cell associated markers CD133, CD44, Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, and drug
   transporters ABCB1, ABCG2, and ABCC1 which are associated with stem cell
   properties in cancer cells. The ABCB1 inhibitor zosuquidar, the ABCG2
   inhibitor Ko143, and the ABCC1 inhibitor MK571 increased calcein
   retention. Neither protein expression of stem cell markers, nor drug
   transporters was significantly changed upon FK866 treatment. In
   conclusion, our data suggest that FK866 inhibits prostate cancer cell
   proliferation by interference with the energy metabolism, and function
   of drug efflux transporters.}},

Title = {{Self-similar decay of the drag wake of a dimpled sphere}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{The drag wake of a dimpled sphere is studied experimentally using stereo
   particle image velocimetry at Re = 5 x 10(4) to a downstream distance of
   similar to 200 diameters. The wake growth and velocity decay are
   analyzed and compared with self-similar decay laws. The measured
   exponents for the mean axial velocity field differ from the classical
   mean-field self-similar solution. This is consistent with other recent
   experimental observations of the near wake of axisymmetric bodies but is
   the first to show a full decade of scaling with nonclassical exponents,
   indicating the scaling is not merely a near-wake effect. The data also
   indicate that deviations from the classical solution may be due to the
   failure of the assumption that velocity fluctuations are in balance with
   production from the mean axial flow. Relaxing this assumption yields a
   family of self-similar decay solutions, one of which is consistent with
   the measured wake decay. The observed solution preserves the velocity
   fluctuation Reynolds number with downstream distance. The experimental
   data also show that individual wake realizations bear little resemblance
   to the mean flow, suggesting that mean flow solutions may have limited
   practical value.}},

   metal-metal to ligand charge transfer (MMLCT) transitions, which arise
   from the combination of close silver-silver interactions and low-lying
   ligand pi{*} orbitals. The complexes' photophysical properties are
   explored via a combination of spectroscopic and computational studies,
   revealing MMLCT excited state lifetimes that exceed 1 mu s. These

Abstract = {{Background High anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels and
   25-hydroxyvitamin D {[}25(OH)D] deficiency have been associated with
   polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) in adult women, and implicated in its
   pathogenesis. Herein we determined if the level of both AMH and 25(OH)D
   are altered in adolescent females with clinical features of PCOS.
   Methods This is a cross-sectional study utilizing a retrospective chart
   review of 128 patients aged 12-20 referred to an academic adolescent
   gynecology and endocrinology clinic for an evaluation of suspected PCOS.
   Unadjusted comparisons of AMH and 25(OH)D distributions between subjects
   with and without PCOS were performed using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test.
   Quantile regression was used to compare the median AMH and 25(OH)D
   between subject groups; adjusting for race, ethnicity, BMI, insurance
   type, age, and season when bloodwork was performed. Results Seventy-four
   subjects were classified as having PCOS by meeting >= 2 of the three
   Rotterdam diagnostic criteria, and 47 subjects met only one Rotterdam
   diagnostic criteria, and were used as the comparative non-PCOS group.
   There were statistically significant unadjusted differences in median
   levels of AMH and 25(OH)D. In the adjusted analyses, median AMH was
   significantly higher in the PCOS group compared to the non-PCOS group (+
   2.39 ng/mL, 95\% CI 0.43, 4.35, p = 0.018); 25(OH)D was significantly
   lower in the PCOS group (- 9.01 ng/mL, 95\% CI -14.49, - 3.53 p =
   0.001). In our sample, adolescents in both groups had insufficient
   25(OH)D level (22 ng/mL) and elevated BMI (32.2 kg/m2). Conclusions
   Adolescents with PCOS display high levels of AMH and low 25(OH)D levels.
   Since traditional clinical markers of PCOS may be physiologic in
   adolescents, AMH and 25(OH)D may be used as surrogate markers of PCOS
   risk in adolescents.}},

Abstract = {{The rational design of organic opto-electronic materials has been one of
   the prime focuses in recent times, and halogen interactions have become
   a major tool in crystal engineering to design multi-component organic
   co-crystals/salts. Tetrabromoterephthalic acid (TBTA), which is able to
   participate in both hydrogen bonding and halogen bonding, has been used
   as a co-crystallizing agent to synthesize four different organic
   co-crystals/salts, TBTA-3-bromopyridine (co-crystal I), TBTA center dot
   TBTA(2-)-2(2-aminopyridine(+))center dot 2H(2)O (co-crystal salt II),
   TBTA(-)-4-aminopyridine(+)center dot H2O (salt III) and TBTA center dot
   TBTA(2-)-2(nicotinamide(+))center dot 2H(2)O (co-crystal salt IV), by a
   conventional solvent evaporation method. These compounds were
   characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD), powder X-ray
   diffraction (PXRD) and spectral and thermal studies. Molecular and
   supramolecular structural analyses reveal that TBTA interacts with the
   pyridyl-containing co-formers through hydrogen bonding and exploits
   several types of halogen bonding (Br center dot center dot center dot O,
   Br center dot center dot center dot H, Br center dot center dot center
   dot Br, Br center dot center dot center dot pi interactions etc.) and pi
   center dot center dot center dot pi interactions to assemble in the
   solid state. TBTA utilizes Br center dot center dot center dot pi
   interactions to assemble with other co-formers while it utilizes Br
   center dot center dot center dot O interactions and preferably type I Br
   center dot center dot center dot Br interactions to assemble with each
   other in these co-crystals/salts. The supramolecular behaviour of TBTA
   within these co-crystals/salts analyzed by Hirshfeld surface analysis
   and associated 2D fingerprint plots also corroborates the
   crystallographic supramolecular structural patterns. Theoretical
   analysis has been carried out for geometry optimization and bandgap
   calculations which were then compared with the optical bandgap values.
   Charge-separated hydrogen bonding and pi center dot center dot center
   dot interactions (Br center dot center dot center dot pi and pi center
   dot center dot center dot pi interactions) have a significant impact on
   the optical and electrical properties of these samples. Solid-state
   luminescence studies reveal that all compounds show a blue shift.
   Electrical conductivity measurements on the ITO/sample/Al sandwich
   structures of these supramolecular complexes reveal Schottky barrier
   diode behaviour and photoresponsivity under illumination.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the authors proposed a class of hierarchical square
   honeycomb metamaterials (HSHMs) with low-frequency broad bandgaps (BGs)
   and flat energy band characteristics. The mechanical model of the square
   honeycomb structure and the in-plane mode lattice dynamics model of the
   HSHMs are presented. The formation mechanism of BGs and flat energy band
   characteristics are obtained by combining the band structure with
   transmission spectra, which was calculated using the finite-element
   method. The numerical results show that the HSHM structure has multiple
   BGs below 100Hz, and the transmission spectra are in accordance with the
   band structure calculations. Additionally, the effects of the scatterer
   shape and the honeycomb parameters of the elastic element on the BGs are
   further analyzed and discussed. Based on the analysis, it was concluded
   that the BGs can be modulated in a wider and lower frequency range by
   changing the scale factor, the length-to-width ratio of the honeycomb
   side beam, and layer dislocation. These research results provide a novel
   structure for the design and application of acoustic metamaterials.

Abstract = {{In optical spectroscopic systems where unwanted optical scattering
   cannot be eliminated, Fabry-Pdrot etalons cause unpredictable changes in
   the spectral background. Frequent system calibration is then required to
   maintain the desired measurement accuracy, which presents a major
   limitation to the spectrometer. We introduce a computational approach to
   mitigate the adverse effects of optical fringing without hardware
   modifications. Motivated by experimental observations of complicated
   fringe behaviors, we simplify the problem by decomposing the fringe
   background into component etalons that can be addressed according to
   their individual characteristics. The effectiveness of the proposed
   method is demonstrated on a silicon photonic methane sensor, where
   accurate measurements of methane concentration are obtained from

Abstract = {{In recent years, metal-rich sulfides of the pentlandite type (M9S8) have
   attracted considerable attention for energy storage applications.
   However, common synthetic routes towards pentlandites either involve
   energy intensive high temperature procedures or solvothermal methods
   with specialized precursors and non-sustainable organic solvents.
   Herein, we demonstrate that ball milling is a simple and efficient
   method to synthesize nanosized bimetallic pentlandite particles
   (Fe4.5Ni4.5S8, Pn) with an average size of ca. 250 nm in a single
   synthetic step from elemental- or sulfidic mixtures. We herein highlight
   the effects of the milling ball quantity, precursor types and milling
   time on the product quality. Along this line, Raman spectroscopy as well
   as temperature/pressure monitoring during the milling processes provide
   valuable insights into mechanistic differences between the
   mechanochemical Pn-formation. By employing the obtained Pn-nanosized
   particles as cathodic electrocatalysts for water splitting in a zero-gap
   PEM electrolyzer we provide a comprehensive path for a potential

Abstract = {{As the distributed energy resources penetration level increases, the
   distribution system operator faces a challenging task of unintentional
   islanding detection. Besides islanding detection schemes are affected
   due to the presence of different types of distributed generation systems
   and smart inverters. The presence of these devices hinders the
   capability of islanding detection schemes. To mitigate these issues,
   this study proposes a practical methodology of variational mode
   decomposition-based energy index for islanding detection. It decomposes
   the sampled voltage signal at the point of common coupling into four
   modes/intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Among these modes/IMFs, the
   energy index of mode two has been utilised to detect the islanding. It
   is an entirely intrinsic, adaptive, and variational method. The five bus
   and practical distribution systems have been modelled using PSCAD/EMTDC
   software while considering various components' practical aspects. The
   technique has been tested for the mixed type of distributed generation
   and various transient events. The test results reveal that the proposed
   method is capable of discriminating the islanding event from other
   disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{Finding relevant information from biological data is a critical issue
   for the study of disease diagnosis, especially when an enormous number
   of biological features are involved. Intentionally, the feature
   selection can be an imperative preprocessing step before the
   classification stage. Equilibrium optimizer (EO) is a recently
   established metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the principle of dynamic
   source and sink models when measuring the equilibrium states. In this
   research, a new variant of EO called general learning equilibrium
   optimizer (GLEO) is proposed as a wrapper feature selection method. This
   approach adopts a general learning strategy to help the particles to
   evade the local areas and improve the capability of finding promising
   regions. The proposed GLEO aims to identify a subset of informative
   biological features among a large number of attributes. The performance
   of the GLEO algorithm is validated on 16 biological datasets, where nine
   of them represent high dimensionality with a smaller number of
   instances. The results obtained show the excellent performance of GLEO
   in terms of fitness value, accuracy, and feature size in comparison with
   other metaheuristic algorithms.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE \& DYNAMICS}},
Abstract = {{In silico analysis of six phytochemicals, flabelliferin, marmelosin,
   piperine, ocimin, curcumin and leucoanthocyanin, along with three drug
   compounds, nelfinavir, remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine, as positive
   control against drug targets of one SARS-CoV-2 viral protease, COVID-19
   main protease (SARS CoV-2 3CL(pro)/M-pro), two coronavirus proteases,
   SARS-CoV main peptidase (SARS CoV M-pro), SARS-CoV main proteinase (SARS
   CoV 3CL(pro)), and one human cellular transmembrane serine proteinase
   (TMPRSS2), was carried out. Except leucoanthocyanin all other
   phytochemicals proved better than all three positive control drugs
   against SARS-CoV main peptidase, whereas, flabelliferin was found to be
   the potential inhibitor for SARS-CoV main proteinase out performing all
   the positive control drugs and phytochemicals. Amongst the compounds
   studied, the best inhibitor for COVID-19 main protease was nelfinavir
   followed by flabelliferin and ocimin. Flabelliferin was found to the
   best promising inhibitor of human cellular transmembrane serine
   proteinase, followed by nelfinavir, curcumin, piperine and marmelosin.
   The result on the inhibition of human cellular transmembrane serine
   proteinase against COVID-19 has a stable therapeutic advantage as
   mutation may quickly occur on viral drug targets. Hence, all the
   phytochemicals tested in the present study are the potential inhibitors
   of the all the four drug targets and can form a part of therapeutics
   against COVID-19 with further clinical studies.

Abstract = {{Nanodiamond (ND)-reinforced polymer composites attract a great deal of
   attention; however, insufficient understanding of their reinforced
   behavior is greatly limiting their further design and application. In
   this paper, a microscopic investigation of the stretched processes of
   aminated ND and resin composites is undertaken to elucidate the
   reinforcement mechanism of ND in the polymer matrix by employing
   molecular dynamics and semi-empirical quantum chemistry simulations. The
   stretching process and reinforcement behavior are observed on the
   nanoscale, and the nano-pinning effect of ND on the resin matrix is
   clarified. Further analyses indicate that due to the increase of system
   volume, the interactions between the ND and resin molecules increase
   with stretching; this facilitates the combination of ND and resin
   molecules and thus recovers the breakage of the resin matrix. This
   recovery process is regarded as the origin of the ND reinforcement of
   the polymer. The strong interaction between the ND and resin molecules
   is quantitatively assessed by the interpenetration of the van der Waals
   surface and the reduced density gradient analysis of electrons using
   quantum chemistry calculations. The high stability of their noncovalent
   combination is also revealed. This investigation provides an excellent
   approach for revealing the origin of ND reinforcement behavior and thus
   facilitates further optimization of the performance of the ND-polymer
   composites.}},

Abstract = {{The ternary thiophosphate PbPS3 was synthesized by a high-temperature
   solid-state reaction using PbS, P and S. Single-crystal X-ray
   diffraction analysis reveals that the compound crystallizes in the
   P2(1)/c space group. It features a three-dimensional structure, which
   consists of {[}PbS8] hendecahedra and isolated ethane-like {[}P2S6](4-)
   units. PbPS3 can be easily obtained by different methods and shows high
   air stability, which is beneficial to its chemical synthesis and
   large-sized crystal growth. The crystal structure, optical properties
   and electronic structure of PbPS3 have been researched by experimental
   methods and first-principles calculations. The results show that PbPS3
   has a moderate bandgap (E-g. exp. = 2.60 eV) and birefringence (Delta
   n(cal). = 0.094@1064 nm), as well as a wide transparent range.
   Furthermore, to better understand the origin of the birefringence,
   structure comparisons and theoretical calculations were carried out.
   With a relatively high physicochemical stability and easy synthesis,
   PbPS3 can be expected to be a prospective birefringent material.}},

Title = {{A Novel Consumer Purchase Behavior Recognition Method Using Ensemble
   Learning Algorithm}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{With the prosperous development of e-commerce platforms, consumer
   returns often occur. The issue of returns has become a stumbling block
   to the profitability of e-commerce companies. To protect consumers'
   purchase rights, the Chinese government has introduced a 7-day
   unreasonable return policy. In order to use the return policy to attract
   consumers to buy, various e-commerce platforms have created a more
   relaxed and convenient return environment for consumers. On the one
   hand, the introduction of the return policy has increased customer trust
   in e-commerce platforms and stimulated purchase demand. On the other
   hand, the return behavior also increases the cost of the e-commerce
   platform. With the upgrading of consumption, customers pay more
   attention to personalized experience. In addition to considering price
   when purchasing online, the quality of services provided by e-commerce
   platforms will also directly affect customers' purchasing decisions and
   return behavior. Therefore, under the personalized return policy of the
   e-commerce platform, whether consumers will make another purchase is
   worth studying. In order to achieve this goal, an ensemble learning
   method (AdaBoost-FSVM) based on fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM) is
   applied to predict the purchase intention of consumers. First, the grid
   search method is used to optimize the modeling parameters of the FSVM
   base classifier. Second, the AdaBoost-FSVM ensemble prediction model is
   constructed by using multiple base classifiers. In order to evaluate the
   performance of the prediction models used, logistic regression (LR),
   support vector machine (SVM), FSVM, random forest (RF), and XGBoost were
   used to construct prediction models for purchasing behavior. The
   experimental results demonstrate that the method used in this study has
   a more accurate prediction effect than the comparison algorithms. The
   predictive model used in this study can be used in the recommendation
   system of shopping websites and can also be used to guide e-commerce
   companies to customize various preferential policies and services, so as
   to quickly and accurately stimulate the purchase intention of more
   potential consumers.}},

Abstract = {{The ever-growing demand for wearable electronic devices is stimulating
   the development of novel materials for fabrication of flexible
   electronics. Among all promising candidates, polysaccharide-based
   hydrogels are constructing a prospective pattern for achieving flexible
   electronic functionalities, benefiting from their ecofriendliness,
   renewability, biodegradability, and sustainability. However, one of the
   most important drawbacks of these hydrogels is slow self-healing. To
   address the above- mentioned issue, we propose a simple method to
   fabricate a starch-based (starch/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/borax, SPB)
   conductive hydrogel. Due to the dual reversible interactions of hydrogen
   bonding and the boronic ester linkages, the hydrogel presents enhanced
   mechanical performance and ultrafast self-healing ability both in air
   and underwater. The mechanical properties recover within 10 s in air and
   within 120 s underwater, and the electronic functionality recovers
   within 90 ms in air and within 110 ms underwater. In addition, the
   abovementioned two interactions also endow the hydrogel with reversible
   sol-gel transition properties, which allow the hydrogel to be reused
   repeatedly. Due to large amounts of Na+ and free B(OH)(4)(-) ions, the
   hydrogel showed great conductivity and may work as strain sensor with
   high sensitivity (GF = 1.02 at 110-200\% strains). The ionic hydrogel
   sensor could rapidly (<= 180 ms) perceive human motions, even very small
   motions such as swallowing and pronunciation. With the combination of
   these seductive features, such an ecofriendly polysaccharide-derived
   hydrogel prepared through a facile and green preparation process would
   have great potential application for sustainable wearable sensors.}},

Abstract = {{This second chapter of Interpreting Kant in Education continues to
   contrast different interpretations of some of Kant's key terms. Kant
   makes many distinctions in formulating his view, most notably between
   spontaneity and intuition, sensibility and the understanding, things in
   themselves and appearances, and receptive and spontaneous knowledge. In
   educational theory such distinctions are typically read as dualisms,
   which is to say that sensibility and the understanding are understood as
   separate entities (getting together to produce knowledge), and
   appearance and thing in itself read as ontologically distinct objects.
   It is argued that these distinctions can be understood in a quite
   different way. This chapter starts by looking at Kant's conception of
   experience and then introduces some distinct understandings of the
   terms, drawn from contemporary readings and commentary on Kant. These
   understandings of his central concepts will be revisited and elaborated
   through the chapters, making for an overall picture that contrasts with
   the widespread `Kantian' one in education.}},

   Free-Space N-Path Systems}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{This work theoretically and experimentally studies metasurfaces with
   spatially discrete, traveling-wave modulation (SDTWM). A representative
   metasurface is considered consisting of columns of time-modulated
   subwavelength unit cells, referred to as stixels. SDTWM is achieved by
   enforcing a time delay between temporal waveforms applied to adjacent
   columns. In contrast to the continuous traveling-wave modulation
   commonly assumed in studies of space-time metasurfaces, here the
   modulation is spatially discretized. In order to account for the
   discretized spatial modulation, a modified Floquet analysis is
   introduced based on a new boundary condition that has been derived for
   SDTWM structures. The modified Floquet analysis separates the scattered
   field into its macroscopic and microscopic variations. The reported
   theoretical and experimental results reveal that the electromagnetic
   behavior of a SDTWM metasurface can be categorized into three regimes.
   For electrically large spatial-modulation periods, the microscopic field
   variation across each stixel can be neglected. In this regime, the
   space-time metasurface allows simultaneous frequency translation and
   angular deflection. When the spatial-modulation period on the
   metasurface is electrically small, the microscopic variation results in
   unique metasurface capabilities such as subharmonic mixing. When the
   spatial-modulation period of the metasurface is wavelength scale, the
   metasurface allows both subharmonic mixing and angular deflection to be
   achieved simultaneously. To verify our analysis, a dual-polarized,
   spatiotemporally modulated metasurface, is developed and measured at
   X-band frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{Circular RNAs are relevant to progression of acute myeloid leukemia
   (AML). Nevertheless, how and whether hsa\_circ\_0002483 (circ\_0002483)
   participates in AML progression are largely uncertain. The bone marrow
   samples were harvested from 31 AML patients or 31 normal subjects.
   Circ\_0002483, microRNA (miR)-758-3p and myelocytomatosis oncogene (MYC)
   abundances were examined via quantitative reverse transcription
   polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. Cell proliferation, cycle
   process and apoptosis were analyzed via Cell Counting Kit-8, flow
   cytometry, caspase 3 activity and related protein levels. Target
   relationship was investigated by dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA
   immunoprecipitation. Circ\_0002483 expression was elevated in AML
   patients and cells. Circ\_0002483 silence constrained AML cell
   proliferation and facilitated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
   miR-758-3p was reduced in AML and decreased via circ\_0002483.
   miR-758-3p down-regulation mitigated the inhibitive influence of
   circ\_0002483 interference on AML progression. MYC was decreased by
   miR-758-3p, and circ\_0002483 could regulate MYC expression by
   miR-758-3p. miR-758-3p overexpression restrained cell proliferation and
   promoted cycle arrest and apoptosis via decreasing MYC. Circ\_0002483
   knockdown repressed AML cell proliferation and promoted cycle arrest and

Abstract = {{Ischemia impacts multiple organ systems and is the major cause of
   morbidity and mortality in the developed world. Ischemia disrupts tissue
   homeostasis, driving cell death, and damages tissue structure integrity.
   Strategies to heal organs, like the infarcted heart, or to replace
   cells, as done in pancreatic islet beta-cell transplantations, are often
   hindered by ischemic conditions. Here, it is discovered that the
   basement membrane glycoprotein nidogen-1 attenuates the apoptotic effect
   of hypoxia in cardiomyocytes and pancreatic beta-cells via the alpha v
   beta 3 integrin and beneficially modulates immune responses in vitro. It
   is shown that nidogen-1 significantly increases heart function and
   angiogenesis, while reducing fibrosis, in a mouse postmyocardial
   infarction model. These results demonstrate the protective and
   regenerative potential of nidogen-1 in ischemic conditions.}},

Title = {{Multimodal Risk-Adapted Treatment in Surgical Patients With Synovial
   Sarcoma: A Preoperative Nomogram-Guided Adjuvant Treatment Strategy}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN SURGERY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: Synovial sarcoma is characterized by heterogeneous clinical
   manifestations, making it difficult to evaluate individual patients'
   prognoses and design personal treatment schemes. We established an
   effective preoperative nomogram to predict cancer-specific survival
   (CSS) and present a risk-adapted adjuvant treatment strategy in surgical
   patients with synovial sarcoma.
   Methods: This retrospective study included patients from the
   Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database who were
   diagnosed with synovial sarcoma between 1996 and 2015. The patients were
   randomly divided into training and validation groups. The predictors
   were selected using univariate and multivariate Cox hazards models. The
   nomogram performance was verified for its discriminatory ability and
   calibration. We further stratified the patients into different risk
   groups according to the nomogram scores and compared the efficacy of
   chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and combination of radiotherapy and
   chemotherapy.
   Results: There were 915 patients enrolled in our study, with 874
   patients either alive or dead due to synovial sarcoma. We established a
   nomogram to predict 5-year CSS based on independent factors, including
   sex, age, grade, tumor size, location, and extent (all p < 0.05). Our
   model showed a consistently good discriminatory ability and calibration
   for predicting 5-year CSS in both the training (c-index = 0.78, 95\% CI
   0.75-0.81) and validation (c-index = 0.73, 95\% CI 0.68-0.78). Based on
   their nomogram scores, we divided patients into 5 groups. Compared to
   patients without adjuvant treatment, nomogram I patients with adjuvant
   treatment had no improvements in 5-year CSS (100.0\% vs. 100.0\%),
   nomogram II patients had higher 5-year CSS with radiotherapy or
   chemotherapy (92.9\% vs. 72.2\%, p = 0.015), nomogram III patients had
   higher 5-year CSS with combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy
   (70.1\% vs. 47.2\%, p = 0.004), nomogram IV patients had higher 5-year
   CSS with radiotherapy (41.3\% vs. 15.6\%, p = 0.015), and nomogram V
   patients had no improvements in 5-year CSS rates with adjuvant treatment
   (28.9\% vs. 16.9\%, p = 0.18).
   Conclusion: The nomogram showed a satisfactory discriminatory ability
   and calibration for predicting 5-year CSS in synovial sarcoma patients.
   Based on this nomogram, we stratified synovial sarcoma patients
   according to risk levels, which enabled us to provide a useful grouping
   scheme that can inform multimodal risk-adapted treatment in synovial
   sarcoma.}},

Abstract = {{Many X-ray scattering experiments require an accurate determination of
   the net intensity or of the shape of the peak for the Compton and
   Rayleigh scattering processes. In this work, a new X-ray scattering
   instrument based on a polycapillary parallel X-ray optic (PPXRO) and a
   polycapillary collimating X-ray optic (PCXRO) was designed to increase
   the signal-to-noise ratio in order to improve the accuracy of the
   determination of the intensities of the Compton (inelastic) and Rayleigh
   (elastic) peaks, enabling accurate, rapid and non-destructive
   measurements. This low divergence configuration is beneficial for
   reducing Compton peak broadening and avoiding the Compton shift with a
   relatively high transmission efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio.}},

Title = {{The Composition and Concordance of Lactobacillus Populations of Infant
   Gut and the Corresponding Breast-Milk and Maternal Gut}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{The maternal gut is the principal source of commensal bacteria in the
   infant gut during the lactation stage, where breast milk acts as an
   intermediary for the transfer of potential probiotic bacteria consortia,
   including Lactobacillus. This study aimed to characterize the bacterial
   communities in human milk, maternal, and infant feces in a small yet
   very homogeneous cohort of 25 healthy mother-infant pairs in
   northwestern China (n = 25, infant age from 7 days to 2 years), with
   special emphasis on the cooccurrence and vertical transfer of
   Lactobacillus phylotypes at the species or strain level in mother-breast
   milk-infant triads. Accurate sequencing analysis revealed that among 73
   Lactobacillus zero-radius operational classification units (ZOTUs)
   identified, 58 belonging to 18 recognized species or species groups were
   distributed in all three types of samples. Lactobacillus ruminis, L.
   mucosae and L. gasseri-johnsonii as true residents were the most
   represented in all three ecosystems, whereas the content of
   Lactobacillus phylotypes commonly developed as probiotics was not
   dominant. While the numbers of Lactobacillus species in breast milk and
   infant feces were greater than that in maternal feces, principal
   coordinates analysis (PCoA) based on beta diversity, coupled with the
   frequency of isolates determined by culture methods, showed that the
   Lactobacillus community in the infant gut was more similar to that in
   the maternal gut than to that in breast milk, suggesting that the gut is
   niche selective for Lactobacillus populations. In addition, identical
   strains of L. ruminis, L. paracasei, L. mucosae and L. salivarius were
   isolated from multiple mother-infant pairs, supporting the hypothesis
   that vertical transfer of bacteria via breastfeeding contributes to the
   initial establishment of the microbiota in the developing infant
   intestine.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: This study investigated the impact of polymer excipients on
   a typical cocrystal for sacubitril (SAC) and valsartan (VAL), aiming to
   guide optional formulation design and maximize oral bioavailability.
   Methods: Poly vinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC)
   and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) were selected. The
   dissolution/permeation system was used to predict both the kinetics of
   drug supersaturation and the simple permeation. The intermolecular
   interaction was analyzed by H-1 NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics
   simulation. Pharmacokinetic study was performed to assess the impact of
   polymer excipients in vivo.
   Results: Our study found that unappreciated excipients in the
   formulation, especially some polymers, might compete with the
   intermolecular hydrogen bonding among the cocrystals components and
   provide unexpected affinity, and thus leverage the therapeutic benefits.
   HPMC as a coating excipient used in the Entresto (R) tablet hampered the
   supersaturation of API, which led to the poor oral absorption of
   cocrystals. Conversely, PVP appeared to promote and maintain drug
   supersaturation, resulting in improved bioavailability of API.
   Conclusion: In conclusion, understanding the interplay between the
   cocrystal components and polymers is the key to optimizing the
   excipients to maximize the performance of cocrystal based oral drug
   formulation.}},

   properties}},
Journal = {{POLYMER}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{211}},
Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{The use of nanoreactors to confine monomers and synthesize polymers
   results in changes in the reaction kinetics and polymer properties
   making nanoconfinement a potential tool for manipulating and engineering
   polymer properties. In this perspective, we cover conventional
   nanoconfinement hosts, nanopore-confined free radical, step-growth, and
   ring-opening polymerizations, and changes in molecular weight,
   tacticity, glass transition temperature (T-g), thermal stability, and
   electrical properties. We use examples from research in our laboratory,
   as well as comparisons of the work in the literature, to illustrate the
   competing forces that drive these changes, namely molecular layering or
   orientation at the nanopore surface, decreased molecular and segmental
   diffusion, and catalytic or inhibitory effects caused by chemical
   moieties on the native or surface-functionalized nanopore surface. The
   majority of nanoconfined polymerizations are found to be accelerated,
   and in the case of free radical polymerizations to generally yield
   higher molecular weights and higher isotacticity. T(g)s for the
   nanoconfined polymers tend to increase if strong interactions exist
   between the polymer and the confinement surface, but depressions are
   observed for confined polycyanurates; the importance of removing
   unreacted monomer and comparing results to the bulk material of same
   molecular weight and structure is emphasized. Examples are also provided
   of enhanced thermal stability and conductivity of polymers synthesized
   under nanoconfinement.}},

Abstract = {{A new conductive metal-organic-framework (MOF) photocatalyst,
   (WO4)(2-)-doped bismuth terephthalate (referred to as nNa(2)WO(4)BiBDC),
   was synthesized and characterized by varying the precursor molar ratio
   (n = 0.1, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5) of Na2WO4/Bi(NO3)(3) in the presence of
   terephthalic acid through a one-pot solvothermal process. This study
   found that doping (WO4)(2-) into BiBDC enhanced the separation of
   photo-generated carriers, improved the photocatalytic properties of
   bismuth terephthalate (BiBDC), and enabled the application in Cr(vi)
   reduction under UV light irradiation with the synergic effect from
   citric acid acting as a hole scavenger. Among all the precursor ratios
   of Na2WO4/Bi(NO3)(3) used, 0.4Na(2)WO(4)BiBDC has the optimum
   performance, leading to triple gain in reduction efficiency for undoped
   BiBDC. The synthetic strategy to dope (WO4)(2-) into a layered MOF as a
   viable option for modification of MOFs was demonstrated in this study.
   Finally, the photoreduction of Cr(vi) by (WO4)(2)-doped bismuth
   terephthalate enables a new promising wastewater treatment option.}},

Abstract = {{In the past decade, great efforts have been devoted to the development
   of organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites for achieving efficient
   photovoltaics, but less attention has been paid to their thermoelectric
   applications. In this study, for the first time, we report the
   thermoelectric performance of
   2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ) doped
   NH2CHNH2SnI3 (FASnI(3)) thin films. It is found that the electrical
   conductivities of the F4-TCNQ doped FASnI(3) thin films increase and
   then decrease along with increased doping levels of F4-TCNQ. Systematic
   studies indicate that enhanced electrical conductivities are attributed
   to the increased charge carrier concentrations and mobilities and
   superior film morphologies of the F4-TCNQ doped FASnI(3) thin films, and
   decreased electrical conductivities originate from the cracks and poor
   film morphology of the F4-TCNQ doped FASnI(3) thin films induced by
   excess F4-TCNQ dopants. The quantitative thermal conductivity scanning
   thermal microscopy studies reveal that the F4-TCNQ doped FASnI(3) thin
   films exhibit ultralow thermal conductivities. Moreover, the
   thermoelectric performance of the F4-TCNQ doped FASnI(3) thin films is
   investigated. It is found that the F4-TCNQ doped FASnI(3) thin films
   exhibit a Seebeck coefficient of similar to 310 mu V K-1, a power factor
   of similar to 130 mu W m(-1) K-2 and a ZT value of similar to 0.19 at
   room temperature. All these results demonstrate that our studies open a
   door for exploring cost-effective less-toxic organic-inorganic hybrid
   perovskites in heat-to-electricity conversion applications at room
   temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Precision marketing has a crucial impact on whether a manufacturer can
   make the most profit. This paper conducts precision marketing based on
   customer demand and analyzes how developers should formulate the
   quantity and pricing of products to obtain optimal profit in the case of
   real demand of customers. First, the research status of the development
   of precision marketing and its demand for its theoretical influence is
   introduced. Secondly, an appropriate real demand function is
   constructed, according to the characteristics of the product and
   consumer positioning, combined with the expression of the demand
   function in economics. Thirdly, by using the constructed ``real
   demand{''} function and combining the basic knowledge of optimization
   and probability theories, the profit function for manufacturers in
   ``real demand{''} pattern is established. When the manufacturer wishes
   to obtain optimal profit from three different sales models, the product
   manufacturing quantity and pricing are analyzed. Finally, an example is
   given to verify the results of the previous analysis.}},

   is performed by installing it directly over the still back wall. Solar
   panel power is used to heat up further the salty water. Moreover, the
   impact of utilizing black steel wool fibers in the still basin on the
   system performance is studied. Results illustrate that preheating 40\%,
   50\%, and 60\% of the salty water rises solar desalination system
   freshwater yield by 10.4\%, 15.5\%, and 20.9\%, energy efficiency by
   8.2\%, 13\% and 20\% and exergy efficiency by 26.86\%, 33.51\%, and
   60.64\%, respectively. Using black steel wool fibers increases
   conventional solar still and solar desalination system production
   without and with 60\% preheating by 17.8\%, 13.7\%, and 11.8\%, energy
   efficiency by 13.58\%, 9.73\%, and 13.5\% and exergy efficiency by
   16.51\%, 10.27\%, and 32.45\%, respectively. Solar desalination system
   with black steel wool fibers and 60\% of water preheating achieves the
   highest performance based on freshwater yield, cost, energy payback
   time, exergoeconomic, exergoenvironmental and exergoenviroeconomic
   parameters. With these positive results and the available solar energy
   in Egypt, the current system can be a promising nation strategy in
   saline water desalination and power production. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA}},

Abstract = {{Here we report on a research effort towards full cell potential
   utilization during the elimination of organic pollutants under
   environmentally relevant conditions. Meropenem was selected as a
   representative recalcitrant antibiotic and a newly-developed Co and Bi
   co-doped TiO2 nanotube array (Co/Bi/TiO2 NTA) electrode was employed as
   both anode and cathode. While electrochemical reduction of Meropenem
   appeared to be much more energy efficient (0.042 kWh/m(3)) than
   electrochemical oxidation (0.813 kWh/m(3)) in synthetic electrolyte, the
   degradation was significantly inhibited in environmental matrices
   (secondary effluent/SE and RO concentrate) due to the competition and/or
   inhibition effects of other species present in the matrices as well as
   electrode fouling. Calcium carbonate and magnesium oxide were identified
   to be main mineral foulants. The elimination of Meropenem was then
   examined in coupled treatment schemes (e.g. sequential and
   simultaneous), taking advantages of the ``self-regeneration{''}
   characteristic of TiO2 NTA based electrodes through cathodic
   polarization. While a simultaneous oxidation \& reduction with regular
   polarity switching seems to be a preferred treatment scheme especially
   for challenging matrices such as RO concentrate, the bipolar stability
   of the nanostructured electrode may limit the electrode lifetime. A
   hybrid electrolysis system coupling anodic oxidation of organic
   pollutants and cathodic hydrogen generation as a renewable energy source
   was also tested in a flow-through reactor, where consistent and steady
   treatment performance was demonstrated for a period of 3 days. We think
   the results obtained from this study have underlined the importance of
   matrix characteristics on the design and selection of electrochemical
   treatment processes. It also provides insights into future development
   of coupled anodic and cathodic processes for water purification. (C)

Abstract = {{It is a challenge to select the right target to treat conditions without
   affecting non-diseased cells. Cancer belongs to the top 10 causes of
   death in the world and it remains difficult to treat. Amongst cancer
   emerging targets, silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) - a histone
   deacetylase - has shown many roles in cancer, ageing and metabolism.
   Here we report novel SIRT1 ligands that bind and modulate the activity
   of SIRT1 within cells and enhance its enzymatic activity. We developed a
   modified aptamer capable of binding to and forming a complex with SIRT1.
   Our ligands are aptamers, they can be made of DNA or RNA
   oligonucleotides, their binding domain can recognise a target with very
   high affinity and specificity. We used the systematic evolution of
   ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) technique to develop circular
   and linear aptamers selectively binding to SIRT1. Cellular consequences
   of the interaction were monitored by fluorescence microscopy, cell
   viability assay, stability and enzymatic assays. Our results indicate
   that from our pool of aptamers, circular AC3 penetrates cancerous cells
   and is recruited to modulate the SIRT1 activity. This modulation of
   SIRT1 resulted in anticancer activity on different cancer cell lines.
   Furthermore, this modified aptamer showed no toxicity on one
   non-cancerous cell line and was stable in human plasma. We have
   demonstrated that aptamers are efficient tools for localisation of
   internal cell targets, and in this particular case, anticancer activity
   through modulation of SIRT1.}},

Title = {{The first commercial use of the Valiant Navion stent graft system for
   endovascular repair of a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm}},
Journal = {{VASCULAR}},
Abstract = {{Objectives
   Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is the standard of care for
   descending thoracic aortic aneurysms (DTAA), and newer generation stent
   grafts have significant design improvements compared to earlier
   generation devices.
   Methods
   We report the first commercial use of the Medtronic Valiant Navion stent
   graft for treatment of an 85-year-old woman with a 5.8 cm DTAA and a
   highly tortuous thoracic aorta.
   Results
   A percutaneous TEVAR was performed using a two-piece combination of the
   Valiant Navion FreeFlo and CoveredSeal stent graft configurations for
   zones 2-5 coverage. The devices were successfully delievered through
   highly tortuous anatomy and deployed, excluding the entire length of the
   aneurysm with precise landing, excellent apposition and no evidence of
   endoleak. The patient tolerated the procedure well and has had no stent
   graft-related complications through one-year follow-up.
   Conclusions
   Design enhancements such as a lower profile delivery system, better
   conformability, and a shorter tapered tip are some of the improvements
   to this third-generation TEVAR device. Coupled with the multiple
   configuration options available, this gives physicians a better tool to
   treat thoracic aortic pathologies in patients with challenging anatomy.
   The early results are encouraging, and evaluation of long-term outcomes
   will continue.}},

Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{264}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{The experimental challenges in the application of spectroscopic
   techniques are resolved by using the theoretical tools. The material
   systems present in the ordinary Portland cement (OPC) are, for the first
   time, subjected to the density functional theory (DFT). A hydration
   model is constructed for the ordinary Portland cement (OPC) paste and
   its mixture with the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by using theoretical and
   experimental Raman spectra. The model conceptualizes the water-cement
   interaction at the molecular level and contends the notion that the CNTs
   are chemically bonded to the silicates in the cement paste matrix. An
   agreement between the theoretical and the experimental Raman spectra
   verifies the model. The major material phases in the cement powder are
   of tri- and dicalcium silicates which interact with the water to form
   hydrated products such as the alite hydrate, the belite hydrate and the
   calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) with a chemical formula, CaH2O5Si2. The
   Raman spectra from the CNT-cement paste mixture shows that the formation
   of the hydrated products does not depend on the concentration of CNTs.
   However, the defect density increases in the cement paste matrix with an
   increase of CNTs concentration. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{Companies are preferring a sustainable production system that meets the
   rigorous environmental regulations and fulfills the demands of customers
   with a qualitative product. The design for remanufacturing (DfRem) is
   one favorable strategy that facilitates protecting the latent energy and
   power in salvaged products/components. This paper presents a
   mathematical model, which describes DfRem as an integral process in
   developing a new product under three different scenarios as: i) when
   only new components are used, ii) when a mix of old and new spare part
   is used, and iii) when only old components are considered. The paper
   defines a strategy in choosing the core acquisition mathematically that
   follows an exponential or delayed S-shaped distribution along with the
   cost model formulations. Using the non-linear optimization modeling, the
   proposed framework has been validated on the sales data related to
   products which belong to altered industries such as automobile,
   telecommunication, and electronics. Results have shown that a product
   developed using the combination of old and new components is better as
   compared to using all new components or all old components. Sensitivity
   analysis has been carried out to examine the impact of the various
   parameters on the decision variables. The significance of this study is
   to provide a solution of procuring components in different manners and
   producing remanufacturable products using either new or used (old)
   components to the manufacturers. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   are highest in the upper hundreds of meters of the ocean and generally
   decrease with depth. Thermocline Pb concentrations are higher in the
   eastern portion of the section near the South American coast, decreasing
   with distance from the South American continent, as previously reported
   for redox sensitive trace elements (e.g., Mn). High precision Pb isotope
   ratios show that there has been a change over the past few decades in
   the source of Pb in the westernmost upper waters, shifting from an
   American-Australian type Pb intermixture to a Chinese-American-type Pb
   intermixture. Although it is known from the study of hydrothermal
   solutions and sediments that there is a large primary Pb flux from high
   temperature ridge crest hydrothermal springs, most of this Pb
   precipitates near the hydrothermal vents and very little escapes into
   the open water column. In fact, hydrothermal ferromanganese
   oxyhydroxides precipitated from the hot spring emissions strip
   anthropogenic Pb out of the water column, resulting in the lowest Pb
   concentrations ever observed in the ocean (a few tenths of a
   picomole/kg) in the high He-3-plume to the west of the East Pacific
   Rise.
   Deeper waters have similarly low Pb concentrations, probably as a result
   of the sinking veil of hydrothermalsource ferromanganese oxyhydroxides.
   Core top sediments from this section and previous work show clear
   evidence of less-radiogenic Mid Ocean Ridge Basalt (MORB) Pb distinct
   from the crustal and anthropogenic Pb seen in non-ridge crest sediments,
   specifically, low values of Pb-206/Pb-207 (1.189), Pb-208/Pb-207
   (2.449), and Pb-206/Pb-204/ (18.42), compared to similar to 1.195,
   similar to 2.475, and similar to 18.75 respectively for the non-
   hydrothermal sediments. Near bottom dissolved ( < 0.2 mu m filter) water
   column Pb (with concentrations < 2 pmol kg(-1)) at the ridge crest and
   in the near-downstream neutrally-buoyant hydrothermal plume show
   Pb-206/Pb-207 - Pb-208/Pb-206 trends that are lower than observed
   throughout the rest of the water column and fall within the mixing
   endmember isotope ratios of less radiogenic MORB and more radiogenic
   anthropogenic Pb sources. Thus there is a very small leakage (similar to
   1\%) of primary high temperature hydrothermal Pb into the water column.
   But at the westernmost station (36), which shows a diluted continuation
   of the He-3, manganese (Mn), and iron (Fe) plume from 2200 to 2700 m,
   the > 2200 m Pb isotope ratios deeper than 2000 m return to the
   non-hydrothermal ratios with no remaining detectable MORB.}},

Abstract = {{Solid-state defect qubit systems with spin-photon interfaces show great
   promise for quantum information and metrology applications. Photon
   collection efficiency, however, presents a major challenge for defect
   qubits in high refractive index host materials. Inverse-design
   optimization of photonic devices enables unprecedented flexibility in
   tailoring critical parameters of a spin-photon interface including
   spectral response, photon polarization, and collection mode. Further,
   the design process can incorporate additional constraints, such as
   fabrication tolerance and material processing limitations. Here, we
   design and demonstrate a compact hybrid gallium phosphide on diamond
   inverse-design planar dielectric structure coupled to single
   near-surface nitrogen-vacancy centers formed by implantation and
   annealing. We observe up to a 14-fold broadband enhancement in photon
   extraction efficiency, in close agreement with simulations. We expect
   that such inverse-designed devices will enable realization of scalable
   arrays of single-photon emitters, rapid characterization of new quantum
   emitters, efficient sensing, and heralded entanglement schemes. (C) 2020

Title = {{Tensile behavior of clayey soils during desiccation cracking process}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{279}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{Desiccation cracking is a common phenomenon on Earth's surface. It is a
   typical form of soils' tensile failure caused by drying-induced tensile
   stress. Understanding soil tensile behavior during the drying process is
   of great significance for revealing the soil desiccation cracking
   mechanism. In this investigation, fiber Bragg grating (FBG) technique
   was employed to develop a new restrained ring, which is able to
   continuously monitor the evolution characteristics of soil tensile
   strain as well as tensile stress during the desiccation cracking
   process. Desiccation tests were carried out on two clayey soils (a lean
   clay and a fat clay). Saturated slurry samples (inside radius of 25 mm,
   outside radius of 75 mm and height of 30 mm) were prepared with initial
   water contents of 58.1\% for the tested lean clay and 106.6\% the tested
   fat clay, and were subjected to continuous drying under constant
   environmental condition (25 +/- 1 degrees C of room temperature, 50 +/-
   5\% of relative humidity). Moreover, a camera was mounted above the soil
   sample to capture the surface changes as well as the initiation and
   propagation of desiccation cracks. The results show that the developed
   FBG-based restrained ring can effectively identify the tensile behavior
   of the soil during the desiccation cracking process. Both the evolution
   of tensile stress and graphic variation show three typical periodic
   features that are well matched with soil vertical deformation, lateral
   shrinkage and cracking. With decreasing water content, tensile stress
   gradually increases at first and then increases more rapidly. Once the
   tensile stress reaches the peak value, desiccation cracks initiate and a
   sudden reduction in tensile stress is observed. Finally, the tensile
   stress reaches a residual stage. We consider the maximal tensile stress
   during the drying process to correspond to the tensile strength of the
   tested material. It is found that clay content has a significant
   influence on the cracking tensile strength of soils. The fat clay with a
   higher clay content shows a larger cracking tensile strength (about 410
   kPa) compared with the lean clay (about 90 kPa).}},

Abstract = {{In this study, 9LiFePO(4)center dot Li3V2(PO4)(3)/C (LFVP-91/C)
   composite cathode materials (molar ratio of LiFePO4:Li3V2(PO4)(3) = 9:1)
   were prepared using a sol-gel (SG) technique and spray drying (SP)
   technique, followed by a calcination process at 650-750 degrees C for 10
   h. Oxalic acid and citric acid were used as chelating agents, L-ascorbic
   acid (AA) was used as a reducing agent, and sucrose (SUC) was used as a
   carbon source. For improving the electrochemical properties of
   LFVP-91/C, different conductive carbon materials were used as carbon
   additives, including graphene oxide (GO), graphene nanosheet (GNS), and
   carbon nanotube (CNT). The experimental results show that the best
   discharge capacities of as-prepared SG-LFVP-91/C are approximately 151.1
   mAh/g at 0.1C/0.1C, 115.2 mAh/g at 0.2C/5C, and 98.2 mAh/g at 0.2C/10C.
   The capacity retention after 100 cycles at 1C/1C is 84.0\%. After
   addition of GO, the best discharge capacity retention increases to
   91.66\% after 100 cycles at 1C/1C. Moreover, after addition of GNS +
   CNT, the discharge capacity of SP-LFVP-91/C/GNS + CNT composite material
   increases to 160.1 mAh/g at 0.1C/0.1C, 129.3 mAh/g at 0.2C/5C, and 117.8
   mAh/g at 0.2C/10C. No capacity fading is observed after 30 cycles at
   0.1C/0.1C. The capacity retentions after 100 cycles and 500 cycles at
   1C/1C increase to 97.58\% and 85.26\%, respectively. This study
   demonstrates that the prepared SP-LFVP-91/C/GNS + CNT composite cathode
   materials are excellent candidates for use in lithium-ion power
   batteries for electric vehicles. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We validated seasonal RayMan and ENVI-met mean radiant temperature
   (T-MRT) simulations to assess model performance in a sensitivity
   analysis from cold to extremely hot conditions. Human-biometeorological
   validation data were collected in Tempe, Arizona via transects during
   five field campaigns between 2014 and 2017. Transects were conducted
   across seven locations in two to three-hour intervals from 6:00 to 23:00
   LST with a Kestrel meter and thermal camera (2014-2015) and the mobile
   instrument platform MaRTy (2017). Observations across diverse urban
   forms, sky view factors, and seasons covered a wide range of solar
   radiation regimes from a minimum T-MRT of 8.7 degrees C to a maximum of
   84.9 degrees C. Both models produced large simulation errors across
   regimes with RMSE ranging from 8 degrees C to 12 degrees C (RayMan) and
   11.2 degrees C to 16.1 degrees C (ENVI-met), exceeding a suggested T-MRT
   accuracy of +/-5 degrees C for heat stress studies. RayMan model errors
   were largest for engineered enclosed spaces, complex urban forms, and
   extreme heat conditions. ENVI-met was unable to resolve infra-domain
   spatial variability of T-MRT and exhibited large errors with RMSE up to
   25.5 degrees C for engineered shade. Both models failed to accurately
   simulate T-MRT for hot conditions. Errors varied seasonally with
   overestimated T-MRT in the summer and underestimated T-MRT in the winter
   and shoulder seasons. Results demonstrate that models should not be used
   under micrometeorological Of morphological extremes without ill-situ
   validation to quantity errors and assess directional bias due to model
   limitations. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Lesion-mimic mutants (LMMs) provide a valuable tool to reveal the
   molecular mechanisms determining programmed cell death (PCD) in plants.
   Despite intensive research, the mechanisms behind PCD and the formation
   of lesions in various LMMs still remain to be elucidated. Here, we
   identified a rice (Oryza sativa) LMM, early lesion leaf 1 (ell1), cloned
   the causal gene by map-based cloning, and verified this by
   complementation. ELL1 encodes a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, and the
   ELL1 protein was located in the endoplasmic reticulum. The ell1 mutant
   exhibited decreased chlorophyll contents, serious chloroplast
   degradation, upregulated expression of chloroplast degradation-related
   genes, and attenuated photosynthetic protein activity, indicating that
   ELL1 is involved in chloroplast development. RNA sequencing analysis
   showed that genes related to oxygen binding were differentially
   expressed in ell1 and wild-type plants; histochemistry and paraffin
   sectioning results indicated that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and callose
   accumulated in the ell1 leaves, and the cell structure around the
   lesions was severely damaged, which indicated that reactive oxygen
   species (ROS) accumulated and cell death occurred in the mutant. TUNEL
   staining and comet experiments revealed that severe DNA degradation and
   abnormal PCD occurred in the ell1 mutants, which implied that excessive
   ROS accumulation may induce DNA damage and ROS-mediated cell death in
   the mutant. Additionally, lesion initiation in the ell1 mutant was light
   dependent and temperature sensitive. Our findings revealed that ELL1
   affects chloroplast development or function, and that loss of ELL1
   function induces ROS accumulation and lesion formation in rice.}},

Title = {{Citizens' engagement in funding renewable and energy efficiency
   projects: A fuzzy set analysis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{277}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{The achievement of climate change targets needs an expansion of
   renewable energies and the restructuring of the whole energy system.
   Investments in renewable and energy efficiency projects require huge
   amounts of funds. A model based on the direct participation of energy
   users in energy production and in the fundraising process is a
   sustainable way in which these climate change targets can be attained
   and guaranteed. The cooperative model and the crowdfunding model are two
   ways of engaging citizens/endusers in fostering this energy transition
   and supplying the missing funds needed for this transition.
   The study focuses on the role played by citizens in the funding of
   renewable and energy efficiency projects, by wondering which factors can
   influence a more effective participation of citizens in the fundraising
   process. By analysing the `Citizenergy' platform, the first European
   platform that provides information on sustainable energy projects, the
   study employs a fuzzy set analysis to identify different combinations of
   factors that can lead to citizens' positive engagement in fundraising
   for renewable and energy efficiency projects seeking funds.
   The research suggests the relevance of a combined use of cooperative and
   crowdfunding models to foster the transition to renewable energy and
   achieve the ambitious climate change goals. Results also highlight the
   critical role played by social networks in projects promotion and by the
   use of the English language in projects description. On the other hand,
   findings show that investment size does not condition the level of
   citizen engagement in sustainable energy projects fundraising process.

Abstract = {{Background: Direct observation of the household spread of influenza and
   respiratory infections is limited; much of our understanding comes from
   mathematical models. The study aims to determine household incidence of
   influenza-like illness (ILI), lower (LRTI) and upper (URTI) respiratory
   infections within a primary care routine data and identify factors
   associated with the diseases' incidence.
   Methods: We conducted two five-year retrospective analyses of
   influenza-like illness (ILI), lower (LRTI) and upper (URTI) respiratory
   infections using the England Royal College of General Practitioners
   (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) primary care sentinel
   network database; a cross-sectional study reporting incident rate ratio
   (IRR) from a negative binomial model and a retrospective cohort study,
   using a shared gamma frailty survival model, reporting hazard ratios
   (HR). We reported the following household characteristics: children < 5
   years old, each extra household member, gender, ethnicity (reference
   white), chronic disease, pregnancy, and rurality.
   Results: The IRR where there was a child < 5 years were 1.62 (1.38-1.89,
   p < 0.0001), 2.40 (2.04-2.83, p < 0.0001) and 4.46 (3.79-5.255, p <
   0.0001) for ILI, LRTI and URTI respectively. IRR also increased with
   household size, rurality and presentations and by female gender,
   compared to male. Household incidence of URTI and LRTI changed little
   between years whereas influenza did and were greater in years with lower
   vaccine effectiveness.
   The HR where there was a child < 5 years were 2.34 (95\%CI 1.88-2.90, p
   < 0.0001), 2.97 (95\%CI 2.76-3.2, p < 0.0001) and 10.32 (95\%CI
   10.04-10.62, p < 0.0001) for ILI, LRTI and URTI respectively. HR were
   increased with female gender, rurality, and increasing household size.
   Conclusions Patterns of household incidence can be measured from routine
   data and may provide insights for the modelling of disease transmission
   and public health policy.}},

Title = {{Arterial spin labeling in the grading of brain gliomas: could it help?}},
Journal = {{EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY AND NUCLEAR MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Gliomas are characterized by high morbidity and mortality
   with low cure and high recurrence rates, which depends to a great degree
   on the angiogenesis of the tumor. Assessment of such angiogenesis by
   perfusion techniques is of utmost importance for the preoperative
   grading of gliomas. The purpose of this study was to assess the role of
   arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion as a non-contrast MRI technique
   in the grading of brain gliomas, in correlation with the dynamic
   susceptibility contrast perfusion imaging (DSC-PI). The study was
   carried out on 35 patients admitted to the Neurosurgery Department with
   MRI features of gliomas and sent for further perfusion imaging.
   Non-contrast ASL followed by DSC-PI was done for all cases. The final
   diagnosis of the cases was established by histopathology.
   Results: Fourteen patients (14/35) had low-grade gliomas while
   twenty-one (21/35) had high-grade gliomas. In low-grade gliomas, four
   cases out of 14 were falsely graded as high-grade tumors showing
   hyperperfusion on ASL, three of which showed DSC-PI hypoperfusion. In
   high-grade gliomas, two cases out of 21 were interpreted as an
   indeterminate grade by ASL showing isoperfusion, however showed
   hyperperfusion on DSC-PI. ROC curve analysis showed ASL-derived rCBF >
   2.08 to have 80.95\% sensitivity, 85.71\% specificity, and overall
   accuracy of 82.86\% compared to 100\% sensitivity, specificity, and
   accuracy of DSC-PI-derived rCBV and rCBF of > 1.1 and > 0.9,
   respectively. A significant positive correlation was noted between ASL
   and DSC-PI with correlation coefficient reaching r = 0.80 between
   ASL-rCBF and DSC-rCBF (p < 0.01) and r = 0.68 between ASL and DSC-rCBV
   (p < 0.01).
   Conclusions: ASL is a relatively recent non-contrast perfusion technique
   that obtains results which are in fair agreement with the more
   established DSC perfusion imaging making it an alternative method for
   preoperative assessment of perfusion of gliomas, especially for patients
   with contraindications to contrast agents.}},

Title = {{Predictive value of the transcranial Doppler and mean arterial flow
   velocity for early detection of cerebral vasospasm in aneurysmal
   subarachnoid hemorrhage}},
Journal = {{ULTRASOUND}},
Abstract = {{Objectives
   We aimed to predict cerebral vasospasm in acute aneurysmal subarachnoid
   hemorrhage and to determine the cut-off values of the mean flow velocity
   by the use of transcranial Doppler.
   Methods
   A total of 40 patients with acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage
   were included in this study and classified into two groups. The first
   group was 26 patients (65\%) with cerebral vasospasm and the second
   group was 14 patients (35\%) without vasospasm. Initial evaluation using
   the Glasgow Coma Scale and the severity of aneurysmal subarachnoid
   hemorrhage was detected by using both the clinical Hunt and Hess and
   radiological Fisher grading scales. All patients underwent transcranial
   Doppler evaluations five times in 10 days measuring the mean flow
   velocities (MFV) of cerebral arteries.
   Results
   Patients with cerebral vasospasm were associated with significantly
   higher mean Glasgow Coma Scale score (p = 0.03), significantly higher
   mean Hunt and Hess scale grades (p = 0.04), with significantly higher
   mean diabetes mellitus (p = 0.03), significantly higher mean systolic
   blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.02 and p = 0.005
   respectively) and significantly higher MFVs measured within the first 10
   days. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that MFV >= 81 cm/s in
   the middle cerebral artery is accompanied by an almost five-fold
   increased risk of vasospasm (OR 4.92, p < 0.01), while MFV >= 63 cm/s in
   the anterior cerebral artery is accompanied by a three-fold increased
   risk of vasospasm (OR 3.12, p < 0.01), and MFV >= 42 cm/s in the
   posterior cerebral artery is accompanied by a two-fold increased risk of
   vasospasm (OR 2.11, p < 0.05).
   Conclusion
   Transcranial Doppler is a useful tool for early detection, monitoring,
   and prediction of post subarachnoid vasospasm and valuable for early
   therapeutic intervention before irreversible ischemic neurological
   deficits take place.}},

Abstract = {{As an essential trace element in the human body, copper ion (Cu2+)
   performs an important role in many fundamental physiological processes
   that need a facile and effective method for the monitoring of Cu2+ in

   Cu2+ was proposed using positively charged carbon dots (P-CDs) as probe.
   The P-CDs prepared from melting strategy exhibited stable,
   biocompatible, and pH-sensitive luminescent properties. P-CDs can be
   selectively quenched by Cu2+ for the direct detection of Cu2+. The
   reaction mechanism between Cu2+ and P-CDs was systematically
   investigated, illustrating that Cu2+ coordinated with the surface
   functional groups in P-CDs. The binding effect of Cu2+ and P-CDs caused
   the constant morphology and static quenching behavior of P-CDs. The
   promising accuracy of the testing results of the addition of Cu2+ in
   diluted serum using P-CDs implied their extended application in the
   biological field.}},

   SRP composites applied to a masonry substrate, little is known about the
   role played by the presence of moisture and salt in the wall. This study
   aims at investigating the bond behavior of SRP-masonry joints under two
   conditions: i) SRP strips are applied to masonry blocks that have been
   previously subjected to an artificial weathering protocol consisting in
   salt crystallization cycles; ii) SRP strips are applied to masonry
   blocks, and then the SRP/masonry joints are saturated with water.
   Single-lap shear tests are conducted on the SRP-masonry joints that
   underwent those two conditions. Digital image correlation (DIC) is used
   to obtain the strain on the surface of the SRP strips. The distribution
   of salts in the masonry blocks and at the SRP-masonry interface after
   failure are investigated as well. Finally, the tensile strength of brick
   tested in both dry and saturated conditions is determined and compared.

Abstract = {{In the transition zone between the Tibetan Plateau and the arid region
   of northwestern China, the spatiotemporal patterns and environmental
   controls of stable isotopes in precipitation remain unclear. A network
   of 19 sampling stations was established across the Qilian Mountains to
   observe stable isotopes in precipitation, and 1310 precipitation
   event-scale samples were collected. The local meteoric water line (LMWL)
   was obtained and expressed as 6D 7.996180- 1457 (R-2 0.96). The
   spatiotemporal patterns of the stable isotopes were mainly dominated by
   the co-influence of the water vapor sources and the local
   environment.The westerly circulation, monsoon circulation, and Arctic
   circulation accounted for 79\%, 13\%, and 8\% of all precipitation
   events in the study region, respectively. The rainout process also
   caused oxygen isotope depletion for continuous precipitation events.
   When the temperature increased by 1 degrees C,6180 increased by 0.47\%.,
   but this increase varied with the temperature range. The effect of
   precipitation amount was apparent in summer and was caused by sub -cloud
   evaporation. In addition, 6180 decreased by 0.13\%. for every 100 m
   increase in altitude in the Qilian Mountains. Future research should
   focus on quantifying the co-influence of sub-cloud evaporation, local
   moisture recycling, and water vapor sources on stable isotopes in
   precipitation. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Mechanical and interface bonding properties of epoxy resin reinforced
   Portland cement repairing mortar}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{264}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{An aqueous epoxy resin with four different dosages was employed to
   enhance ordinary Portland cement (OPC) mortar for the first time used as
   a polymer-cement repairing material. Experimental results showed that
   the flexural toughness of the epoxy resin modified OPC mortar was
   obviously improved without losing too much compressive strength. In
   addition, three different interface bonding strengths used for
   evaluation of the interface bonding properties were all enhanced with
   certain dosages of epoxy resin. For instance, the interfacial flexural
   bonding strength, direct interface shear strength and interface tensile
   strength of the OPC mortar with epoxy resin dosage at 5\% was increased
   by approximately 16.7\%, 29.8\% and 6.9\% respectively compared to the
   control mortar without epoxy resin. It is assumed that the epoxy resin
   formed as polymer films which could improve the microstructure of OPC
   mortars as evidenced by scanning electron microscopy analysis via
   integrating different components in binder matrix and crack bridging
   effect is the main reason for the related improvements. Thus, this newly
   developed OPC mortar reinforced by suitable contents of aqueous epoxy
   resin is a promising repairing material for mitigating deteriorations of
   concrete which awaits further applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

Year = {{2020}},

Pages = {{1721-1728}},

Abstract = {{Phase singularities are seen in optical vortex beams, which are located
   in a two-dimensional spatial plane. Phase singularities in optical
   spectra are not common, but exploiting the extreme phase behavior around
   the singularity point could improve conventional optical devices for
   molecular-/bio-sensing, large phase modulation, etc. Recently, spectral
   phase singularities have been reported in reflection-type metamaterials
   but have not yet been reported in transmission. In this work, we
   demonstrate a spectral phase singularity in a transmission-type
   double-layer metamaterial. We attribute the mechanism to two different
   types of resonances in the double-layer metamaterial, namely a hybrid
   resonance and an anti-parallel dipole resonance. By controlling the
   lattice size of the double-layer metamaterial, we can manipulate the
   coupling of the two types of resonances. At a critical-coupling point,
   the phase singularity occurs in a spectrum-lattice diagram. We developed
   film metamaterial devices to experimentally demonstrate the phase
   singularity. Our results could enable investigation of coupled resonator
   systems, and may have applications in tunable metamaterial device design
   and improved sensing techniques. (C) 2020 Optical Society of America

Title = {{Determining the water content and void ratio of cement-treated dredged
   soil from the hydration degree of cement}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{279}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{Many important geotechnical and engineering geology properties of
   cement-treated dredged soil (CDS) depend on its the water content and
   void ratio (WC\&VR). Based on the hydration model of cement, this study
   proposes time-evolution models of WC\&VR in CDS, and verifies their
   reliability by fitting to experimental data. The two fitting parameters
   tau and beta in the models depended only on the type of soil. Increasing
   the cement content (A(w)) and initial water content (w(0)) of the
   dredged soil accelerated the decrease rate of WC\&VR with curing time,
   but barely affected the duration of each stage in the WC\&VR evolution
   curves. Next, the specific evolution laws and mechanisms of WC\&VR in
   the curing process were fully discussed. The changes in WC\&VR were
   consistent, and both trends exhibited typical four-stage
   characteristics: an initial steady stage, an accelerated descent stage,
   a decelerated descent stage, and a final steady stage. In
   microstructural analyses by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron
   microscopy, and thermo-gravimetric analysis, the evolution of WC\&VR was
   found to be mainly related to the formation of cement hydration
   products, and the evolution characteristics well accorded with the
   hydration properties of cement.}},

Abstract = {{Silica modified imidazolium {[}smim] based halometallic ionic liquids,

   {[}smim]{[}FeCl4](-) was used for the preparation of heterogeneous
   catalyst ({[}smim]{[}FeCl4](-)@Nd2O3) by simple immobilization of IL on
   Nd2O3 nanoparticles. The structure of {[}smim]{[}FeCl4](-)@Nd2O3 was
   established by various techniques including FTIR, Raman, UV-vis DRS,
   powder XRD, SEM/EDX, elemental mapping, TEM, TGA, EPR and XPS analyses.
   The stability of nano-catalyst, {[}smim]{[} FeCl4](-)@Nd2O3, was
   established with the help of zeta potential analysis which showed a
   value of -40.32 mV lying under the stability range. Potentiometric
   titration with n-butyl amine was used to evaluate the acidic properties
   of {[}smim]{[}MCl4] as well as {[}smim]{[}FeCl4](-)@Nd2O3. The catalytic
   potential of the material was probed through the one pot synthesis of
   N-aryl indeno pyrrole derivatives. The results showed excellent
   performance of the material by producing a high yield (98\%) of indeno
   pyrrole derivatives. A recyclability experiment revealed that the
   catalyst was efficient in up to five cycles with insignificant loss in
   catalytic activity. The evaluation of green metrics indicated the
   sustainability of the present protocol in terms of high atom economy and
   low E-factor.}},

Abstract = {{Modern nanophotonic and meta-optical devices utilize a tremendous number
   of structural degrees of freedom to enhance light-matter interactions. A
   fundamental question is how large such enhancements can be. We develop
   an analytical framework to derive upper bounds to single-frequency
   electromagnetic response, across near- and far-field regimes, for any
   materials, naturally incorporating the tandem effects of material- and
   radiation-induced losses. Our framework relies on a power-conservation
   law for the polarization fields induced in any scatterer. It unifies
   previous theories on optical scattering bounds and reveals new insight
   for optimal nanophotonic design, with applications including far-field
   scattering, near-field local-density-of-states engineering, optimal
   wavefront shaping, and the design of perfect absorbers. Our bounds
   predict strikingly large minimal thicknesses for arbitrarily patterned
   perfect absorbers, ranging from 50-100 nm for typical materials at
   visible wavelengths to micrometer-scale thicknesses for polar
   dielectrics at infrared wavelengths. We use inverse design to discover
   metasurface structures approaching the minimum-thickness
   perfect-absorber bounds. (C) 2020 Optical Society of America under the

Title = {{Structural overprinting criteria determined from regional aeromagnetic
   data: An example from the Hill End Trough, East Gondwana}},
Journal = {{TECTONOPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{797}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{Determining overprinting relationships in the geological record has
   underpinned our understanding of the evolution of the Earth and has
   provided the context in which to interpret geoscientific datasets.
   Geological overprinting relationships are generally determined from
   outcrop relationships. When outcrop is absent or limited, overprinting
   relationships using geological observations is often ineffective or
   ambiguous. We show how aeromagnetic data can be used to inform
   superposition of geological structures using a combination of folded
   stratigraphy, faults (both high angle and low angle), and plutons from
   the well-exposed Hill End Trough, in the Phanerozoic eastern Lachlan
   Orogen. Overprinting relationships reveal episodic inversion of the Late
   Silurian to Early Devonian back arc basin succession, preserved within
   the Hill End Trough, occurred during superimposed shortening events. The
   first event resulted in the development of regional folds associated
   with the Tabberabberan Orogeny and the second event resulted in the
   development of overprinting north-south and north-northwest trending
   faults during the Early Carboniferous Kanimblan Orogeny. Inversion
   structures are overprinted by a Carboniferous granite, which is
   overprinted by previously unrecognised northeast- and northwest
   conjugate faults, which we interpret to be related to the Permo-Triassic
   Hunter Bowen Orogeny.}},

Title = {{Effect of polyether-type SRA on the drying shrinkage, pore structure and
   properties of blended mortar incorporating limestone powder}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{264}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{Currently, the incorporation of industrial solid wastes such as
   limestone powder (LSP) has been proofed to be an effective solution to
   reduce cement consumption and further carbon dioxide emissions. However,
   the volume changes caused by shrinkage may induce high tensile stresses,
   which result in warping especially when the material is partly or wholly
   restrained. It has been reported that the addition of shrinkage reducing
   agent (SRA) in cementitious materials could largely reduce the magnitude
   of drying shrinkage, but causes negative side effects at the same time.
   To examine the influence of SRA on the performance of blended mortar
   with LSP, flowability, mechanical properties and porosity of mortars
   were studied. Mixtures without SRA, with 1.0\%, 1.5\%, 2.0\%, 2.5\% and
   3.0\% of a polyether-type SRA (by mass of cement) were prepared. The
   specimens were characterized by measuring their air content, packing
   density, flexural/compressive strength, drying shrinkage and
   corresponding mass loss. Pore characteristics were also investigated by
   mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) for mortars with and without SRA.
   The experimental results show, that polyether-type SRA improves the
   flowability of fresh mortar but reduces the packing density, flexural
   and compressive strength. Mixtures with SRA show a comparative reduction
   in long-time drying shrinkage and mass loss, which can be defined by two
   stages: (i) high mass loss during the first days, (ii) drying shrinkage
   increasing linearly with the mass loss. Pore size distribution results
   indicate that the addition of SRA increases the pore size coarseness and
   average pore radius of mortar. The shrinkage reduction mechanism of
   polyether-type SRA could be the double effect of decreasing surface
   tension and increasing average pore radius accordingly. (C) 2020

Title = {{The effect of cold waves on daily mortality in districts in Madrid
   considering sociodemographic variables}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{749}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{While there is much research that focuses on the association between
   cold waves and their impacts on daily mortality at the city level, few
   analyze the impact related to social context and demographic variables
   at levels lower than the municipal. The objective of this study was to
   determine the role of the percentage of people over age 65, income level
   and percentage of homes without heating in the analysis of the impact of
   cold waves on daily mortality between January 1, 2010 and December 31,
   2013 in different districts of the municipality of Madrid. We calculated
   Relative Risks (RR) and Attributable Risks (RA) for each of 17 districts
   to determine correlations between the effect of cold waves and daily
   mortality due to natural causes (CIEX: A00-R99) using Generalized Linear
   Models (GLM) of the Poisson family (link log). The pattern of risks
   obtained by district was analyzed using binomial family models (link
   logit), considering socioeconomic and demographic variables. In terms of
   results, an impact of cold on mortality was detected in 9 of the 17
   districts analyzed. The analysis of risk patterns revealed that the
   probability of detecting an impact in a district increases in a
   statistically significant way (p-value <0.05) with a higher percentage
   of homes without heating systems and a higher percentage of population
   over age 65. The results obtained identify the factors that should be
   considered in public health policies that target the district level to
   reduce the impact of cold waves. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Multi-hazard vulnerability of buildings to debris flows}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{279}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{Landslide hazards often occur in succession with multiple hazardous
   processes. The elements at risk such as buildings are therefore exposed
   to a multi-hazard environment. Multi-vulnerability assessment is a
   critical component of multi-hazard risk analysis. In this paper, effect
   of hazard interactions on the physics of building damage is formulated
   from the perspective of triggering and temporal relations. A fragility
   analysis framework for generating physics-based vulnerability models for
   sequentially and concurrently occurring hazards is proposed. Monte Carlo
   simulation is used in the framework to include the uncertainties from
   both hazard intensity and building properties. The framework is
   illustrated by evaluating the failure probability of a typical
   reinforced concrete building impacted by multiple surges of debris
   flows. Considering specific debris flow-building interaction mechanisms,
   nonlinear finite-element pushover analysis is adopted to obtain the
   building response under debris flow impact. By quantifying the physical
   damage caused by the primary debris flow, the cumulative damage effect
   of the sequentially occurring debris flows is formulated. The amplified
   damage effect of the concurrently occurring debris flows is however case
   specific. The proposed methodology shows potential to address more
   complex multi-hazard scenarios and enhance the multi-vulnerability
   assessment, filling the research gap on multi-vulnerability assessment
   for landslide hazards.}},

Abstract = {{Palladium (Pd) is commonly used as a catalyst for automobiles and
   electronic devices, and a reliable source of Pd is required for
   continued commercial applications. Biomineralization has attracted
   attention as an inexpensive and eco-friendly recycling approach for a
   continued supply of Pd. Escherichia coli is one of the best hosts for
   collecting Pd because it grows rapidly and requires an inexpensive
   minimal medium. Although E. coli can reduce Pd ions, the mechanism of
   reduction has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we
   investigated the genes involved in the reduction of Pd ions in E. coli.
   A gene responsible for the reduction of Pd ions was identified from
   approximately 4000 genes, other than essential genes, by using the
   single-gene-knockout library. The rate of reducing Pd ions by E. coli
   cells was evaluated. Among the investigated single-gene-knockout
   strains, 7 strains including the gene related to membrane transport,
   transcriptional regulation, and metabolic enzyme promote the reduction
   of Pd ions, and 73 strains including the genes related to formate
   metabolism and molybdopterin synthesis repress the reduction of Pd ions.
   Our results may provide a new perspective for the improvement of the
   bioreduction of minor metals.}},

Abstract = {{Aim The aim was to identify the prevalence of hip contractures and their
   association with gross motor function and pain in the lower extremities
   among Danish children with cerebral palsy (CP).
   Methods This cross-sectional study was based on data collected during
   regular clinical examinations in 2018-2019 and registered in the
   National Danish Clinical Quality Database of children with CP. The study
   population was 688 children (59\% boys) aged five to 12 years across all
   Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels. Any
   associations between hip contracture and gross motor function and pain
   were investigated with logistic regression analysis and presented as
   odds ratios (OR) with 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI).
   Results The prevalence of hip contracture was 22\% across all five GMFCS
   levels, and the incidence varied across the five Danish regions. The
   odds ratios for hip contracture were significantly higher at GMFCS level
   IV (OR 1.99, 95\% CI 1.10-3.62) and V (OR 5.49, 95\% CI 3.33-9.07)
   compared with level I. Hip contractures were not significantly
   associated with pain in the lower extremities (OR 1.43, 95\% CI
   0.95-2.15).
   Conclusion Hip contractures were frequent and associated with low gross
   motor function, but not lower extremity pain, in children with CP.}},

Title = {{Impact of CNTs' treatment, length and weight fraction on ordinary
   concrete mechanical properties}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},

Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{This study investigates the effect of the treatment, length and weight
   fraction parameters of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) on the
   mechanical properties of concrete. Mixes with various CNTs' amounts
   ranging between 0.03 and 0.5 wt\% were prepared using treated and
   untreated short and long CNTs. The flexural, compressive, and tensile
   strengths of the concrete composites were determined after 28, 56 and 90
   days of curing. After that, the microstructures of the samples were
   investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The results
   were then analyzed using statistical t-tests to evaluate the
   significance of adding CNTs to concrete. The results showed that 0.03\%
   long-treated CNTs increased compressive, flexural, and tensile strengths
   of ordinary concrete by 23, 29 and 20\%, respectively. CNTs' weight
   fraction and treatment parameters showed a noticeable effect on concrete
   strength. Concrete batches with 0.03 and 0.08\% treated CNTs and 0.08\%
   non-treated CNTs' showed a relatively higher strength gain. Statistical
   t-tests confirmed that incorporating 0.03\% long-treated CNTs into
   concrete had significantly improved compressive, flexural and tensile
   strengths. The analysis also showed that using fewer CNTs' amounts of
   0.03 and 0.08 wt\% yielded higher strength results irrespective of the
   nanofilament treatment. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background High grade basal-like breast carcinomas are triple negative,
   express basal cytokeratins, and are known for the overall poor prognosis
   and aggressive behavior. HPV related multiphenotypic sino-nasal
   carcinoma has overlapping histology with basal-like breast carcinomas,
   but carry the defining feature of association with high risk HPV. Case
   presentation We present a case of a perimenopausal woman with a
   non-healing ulcerated lesion involving the nipple and breast following a
   trauma. Biopsy performed showed an HPV-positive basal-like carcinoma
   with squamous differentiation involving the breast, analogous to
   multiphenotypic carcinoma previously described in the sinonasal tract.
   Conclusion This is the first report of a case of a high- risk HPV
   related basal-like carcinoma with squamous differentiation, described in
   the literature. We highlight the morphology and immunophenotype of this
   lesion and its recognition when compared to other multiphenotypic
   lesions of the breast, and suggest that pathologists should consider HPV
   evaluation when encountering similar basal-like tumors involving the
   breast.}},

Title = {{Comprehensive proteomic analysis revealing multifaceted regulatory
   network of the xero-halophyte Haloxylon salicornicum involved in salt
   tolerance}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{324}},

Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{Haloxylon salicornicum is a xero-halophyte which grow predominantly in
   dry saline areas. However, the proteomic approach for revealing the
   regulatory network involved in salt adaptation of this important
   xerohalophyte has not been studied so far. In the present investigation,
   the label-free quantitative proteomic analysis was carried out in shoot
   of H. salicornicum to get an insight into the functional network of
   proteins involved in salt tolerance. Comparative proteomic analysis in
   control and salt treated plants of H. salicornicum by nano-ESI-LC-MS and
   MS/MS, and data base searching led to the identification of 723
   proteins. Pathway enrichment analysis by KEGG uncovered various
   biological pathways to which salinity induced differentially regulated
   proteins are involved. In H. salicornicum, out of 723 identified
   proteins, 187 proteins were differentially regulated in response to
   salinity. In addition to significant up-regulation of stress responsive
   proteins, other proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism, TCA cycle,
   protein synthesis, antioxidative defense systems, energy transfer, ion
   transport, nucleotide binding, and proteosomal proteins also
   significantly up-regulated under salinity in H. salicornicum. The major
   photosynthetic proteins up-regulated were RuBisCo, D1 protein,
   photosystem II-CP47, and cytochrome b599. TCA cycle component proteins
   such as citrate synthase, succinate dehydrogenase, and malate
   dehydrogenase upregulated indicating their significant roles in
   providing vital energy for salinity tolerance. Salinity induced higher
   expressions of ion transporters in H. salicornicum suggest efficient
   compartmentalization of toxic sodium ions. In addition, up-regulation of
   antioxidative defense system can be correlated with effective scavenging
   of salinity induced ROS, hence imparting salt tolerance. In H.
   salicornicum, protein synthesis was boosted under salinity as confirmed
   from the salinity-induced up-regulation of the ribosome associated
   proteins. Salinity induced significantly changed proteins of the
   ribosomal pathway include ribosomal protein components such as
   elongation factor-Tu (EF-Tu), initiation factor 1 and 2 (IF1, 2), Rpo
   cluster C and B, etc. Functional integrity of protein synthesis
   machinery in H. salicornicum is maintained under high salinity by higher
   abundance of ribosomal subunit proteins in NaCl-treated plants. We
   assume that consistent energy supply by the up-regulation of TCA cycle
   along with uninterrupted protein synthesis and maintenance of structural
   integrity of the photosynthetic machinery are the primary mechanism of
   salinity tolerance of H. salicornicum. In the present study, we
   comprehensively elucidated possible mechanisms associated with
   systematic salt tolerance of H. salicornicum employing proteomic
   approach. The information from this study will contribute to the genetic
   improvement of crop plants that can be grown in saline marginal lands.}},

Abstract = {{Sustained release nanoformulations of second line antitubercular drugs
   levofloxacin and ethionamide had shown promise in pharmacokinetics and
   acute and sub-acute toxicity studies. The present study evaluated the
   clastogenicity potential of the nanoformulations of these antitubercular
   agents. Clastogenicity was evaluated by (a) in vitro micronucleus assay
   (b) in vivo micronucleus assay in Swiss albino mice and (c) sister
   chromatid exchange (SCE) in CHO cell lines. Ethionamide and levofloxacin
   loaded nanoparticles were 312 +/- 64 nm and 245 +/- 24 nm in size
   respectively and drug encapsulation was 35.2 +/- 3.1\% w/w and 45.6 +/-
   9.4\% w/w, respectively. The frequency of MN-NCE/1000 NCE and
   MN-PCE/1000 PCE were significantly reduced in mice treated with
   ethionamide nanoparticle (3.5 +/- 0.9, 13.8 +/- 16.68) and levofloxacin
   nanoparticles (5.6 +/- 2.7, 16.7 +/- 12.7) compared to the mice treated
   with free ethionamide (11.5 +/- 4.1, p = 0.23 and 45.19 +/- 19.21, p =
   0.38) and free levofloxacin (14.7 +/- 1.88, p < 0.0001 and 54.6 +/-
   18.1, p = 0.0017), respectively. For in vitro, micronucleus assay
   frequencies of micronuclei per thousand bi-nucleated cells (MN-BN/1000
   BN) was 188.3 +/- 20.20 and 148 +/- 20.42 for ethionamide and
   levofloxacin nanoparticles as compared to 232.6 +/- 16.04 (p = 0.52) and
   175 +/- 5.56 (p = 0.45) for free ethionamide and levofloxacin,
   respectively. The average number of SCE per cell for nanoformulation of
   ethionamide were not different from that of free drug (4.9 +/- 0.51 vs
   4.1 +/- 0.55, p = 0.86). The SCE per cells were not significant
   difference for nanoformulation of levofloxacin (2.33 +/- 1.36 vs 5.46
   +/- 0.25, p = 0.88). In vitro and in vivo assays have shown relatively
   less clastogenic potential of equivalent dose of ethionamide
   nanoparticles as compared to the conventional formulation.}},

Title = {{Choking under pressure: Does it get easier with age? How loneliness
   affects social monitoring across the life span}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL DEVELOPMENT}},
Abstract = {{Previous experimental work showed that young adults reporting loneliness
   performed less well on emotion recognition tasks (Diagnostic Analysis of
   Nonverbal Accuracy {[}DANVA-2]) if they were framed as indicators of
   social aptitude, but not when the same tasks were framed as indexing
   academic aptitude. Such findings suggested that undergraduates reporting
   loneliness possessed the social monitoring skills necessary to read the
   emotions underlying others' facial expressions, but that they choked
   under social pressure. It has also been found that undergraduates
   reporting loneliness have better recall for both positive and negative
   social information than their non-lonely counterparts. Whether those
   effects are evident across different age groups has not been examined.

   Experiment that included participants aged 16-99 years (N = 54,060), we
   (i) test for replication in a larger worldwide sample and (ii) extend
   those linear model analyses to other age groups. We found only effects
   for participants aged 25-34 years: In this age group, loneliness was
   associated with increased recall of negative individual information, and
   with choking under social pressure during the emotion recognition task;
   those effects were small. We did not find any such effects among
   participants in other age groups. Our findings suggest that different
   cognitive processes may be associated with loneliness in different age
   groups, highlighting the importance of life-course approaches in this
   area.}},

Abstract = {{Background The family-centred approach is fundamental in the therapeutic
   process of children with cerebral palsy (CP), and the increased
   competence of parents about therapeutic devices, especially orthoses,
   can facilitate its implementation, thus intensifying the benefits that
   this device provides. The aim of this study was to understand the
   perception of mothers of children with CP in relation to their
   children's ankle-foot orthosis.
   Methods This is a qualitative study using thematic content analysis
   technique. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews from 24
   mothers of children with Levels IV and V of CP according to the Gross
   Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS), who were attended at a
   philanthropic rehabilitation centre.
   Results Three categories were identified from analyzing the interviews:
   benefits of the orthosis, the orthosis in the child's daily life and
   `What if it were like this?'
   Conclusions According to the mothers' perceptions, the ankle-foot
   orthosis improved their child's mobility. The orthoses are used in
   different contexts in the child's daily life, and the mothers pointed
   out suggestions regarding personalizing the orthosis with different
   colors and patterns, increasing comfort and facilitating the way in
   which the device is placed.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{749}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{A low saline backwater canal, mainly utilized for domestic and
   agricultural purposes, has been analyzed for the possible presence of
   organic micropollutants (OMP) and their potential removal was explored
   by multilayered microfiltration membranes. The qualitative as well as
   quantitative analysis were carried out for a span of one year using the
   technique of liquid chromatography connected with high resolution mass
   spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF-MS). The identification of the formally unknown
   compounds was initially done using non-target analysis based on the mass
   accuracy, isotopic pattern and MS, spectral interpretation. Results of
   the non target screening revealed the presence of 11 OMPs. Five of these
   OMPs were confirmed using standards; these include chlorophene (CHP),
   oxybenzone (OXY), N, N-diethyl-meta-Loluamide (DEET), N,
   N-diethyl-benzamide (DEB) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP). Among the
   confirmed OMPs, the highest concentration was observed for DBP (244.61
   ng l(-1)). The most frequently observed OMP in the study area was DBP
   while the least was DEB which is an insect repellent as well as a
   degradation product of DEET. The ecological risk associated with the
   target compounds has also been analyzed by calculating the risk quotient
   (RQ) and the results revealed that at the detected levels, these
   compounds are capable of causing low to medium risk. Low pressure (<0.3
   bar) filtrations of the compounds were attempted using microfillralion
   (ME) and, poly (ethyleneimine)/poly(styrene sulfonale) (PEI/PSS)
   multi-layered MF membrane for spiked ultrapure water and also tot
   natural water from the back-water canal. The batch mode illustrates
   nearly complete removal of CHP and OXY in spiked solutions and a good
   removal efficiency from natural water. The effect of coexisting ions and
   surfactants in feed is also illustrated. The high efficiency of the
   removal of both CHP and OXY, in such a complex medium highlights the
   potential application of the present method for the removal of similar
   OMPs in natural waters. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by the study of security issues in molecular communication,
   this paper addresses the problem of secure communication in a
   bio-inspired field where confidentiality of the information is of
   significant importance. The new metrics are used for the secrecy
   analysis where eavesdropper's decodability of confidential message and
   amount of information leakage is taken into account, which is not
   considered using conventional secrecy outage probability. A
   diffusion-based molecular communication system is considered where the
   information to be transmitted is the time of release of the molecules.
   Typically in the existing literature in molecular timing channels, the
   position of the eavesdropper is known, which is usually an unpractical
   assumption. If no information about eavesdropper is known, it could be
   located at any distance with probability distribution be assumed to be
   uniform and Gaussian. In this paper, the closed-form expressions for the
   eavesdropper capacity, generalised secrecy outage probability, average
   fractional equivocation and average information leakage rate have been
   obtained when the eavesdropper is located at a random distance from the
   transmitter.}},

Abstract = {{ZCCHC14 is a CCHC-type zinc finger protein which is expressed in tissues
   in human and mouse. The function of ZCCHC14 in tumours remains unclear.
   In this research, we explored the expression, function and related
   molecular mechanisms of ZCCHC14 in human non-small cell lung cancer
   (NSCLC). Immunochemistry staining showed that ZCCHC14 was low-expressed
   or absent in NSCLC tissues. In NSCLC patients, the low expression of
   ZCCHC14 in tumour tissues was significantly correlated with TNM stage,
   differentiation degree and adverse clinical outcome (P < .05). The
   proliferation and invasion ability of cancer cells transfected with
   ZCCHC14 CRISPR/Ca9 KO plasmids was significantly enhanced (P < .05).
   Immunoblotting analysis indicated that the expression of p-P38, cyclinD1
   and MMP7 were significantly up-regulated after disabling ZCCHC14 (P <
   .05). We used MAPK-P38 pathway inhibitor doramapimod (BIRB 796) to
   inhibit P38 signalling pathway activity and determined that the agent
   significantly disrupted the function of ZCCHC14 and hindered the
   proliferation and invasion of the tumour. The finding revealed that
   ZCCHC14 can regulate proliferation and invasion of NSCLC through the P38
   pathway. ZCCHC14 plays a crucial regulatory role in the development of
   NSCLC and may become a zinc finger target for clinical treatment.}},

Abstract = {{The construction of efficiently non-noble metal bifunctional
   electrocatalysts for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen
   evolution reaction (HER) is a major challenge for renewable energy
   generation. Here, considering the synergistic effect of differently
   metal sites and excellent electrocatalytic activities of bimetallic
   phosphides, the hybrids of NiCo bimetallic phosphides (NiCo-P) are
   prepared by one-step phosphorization of NiCo metal-organic frameworks
   (NiCo-BDC) as bifunctional electrocatalysts for water splitting.
   Benefiting from the unique porous structure and synergistic effect of
   Ni2P and Co2P in bimetallic phosphides system, Ni1Co1-P hybrid exhibits
   outstanding electrocatalytic activities for both OER and HER, with small
   overpotentials 343 mV (OER) and 169 mV (HER) at a current density of 10
   mA cm(-2) in alkaline conditions, respectively, which compares to
   monometallic phosphides (Ni-P and Co-P) and Ni-P + Co-P sample,
   illustrating the existence of Ni2P/Co2P interface as an essential
   requirement to achieve the synergistic effect and the improved catalytic
   activities in NiCo-P system. This work provides a general strategy to
   design more efficient multicomponent electrocatalysts. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This article examines the influence of street-level bureaucratic
   discretion over the timing of implementation on road safety policy
   outcomes. It is premised on freshly collected data from road users and
   traffic enforcement officers in Nairobi, Kenya. It employed Street-Level
   Bureaucratic Theory for purposes of conceptualization. It observed that
   traffic police divisions, like most street-level bureaucracies, are
   chronically under-resourced. They do not have sufficient officers and
   equipment to monitor safety police compliance and conduct traffic
   control activities among other roles. To cope with these challenges,
   they make discretionary choices over activities to concentrate on at any
   given time. Given that the police play an important role in fostering
   road safety policy compliance, the study concludes that their failure to
   target safety implementation at the time when the violations are
   prevalent is linked to the incessant road safety policy failures across
   the globe.}},

Abstract = {{Background There are three major types of genetic cutaneous porphyrias
   (GCP): erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP), variegate porphyria (VP),
   and hereditary coproporphyria (HCP). Scarce data are available regarding
   their impact on patients' quality of life in the Mediterranean region.
   Purpose To describe the cutaneous features of GCP in Israel.
   Methods An established nationwide cohort of patients with GCP diagnosed
   during 1988-2019 was surveyed by telephone for cutaneous features of
   GCP. Impact on quality of life was assessed using the Dermatology Life
   Quality Index.
   Results Of the 95 patients with GCP, 71 (75\%) completed the survey (21
   HCP; 40 VP; 10 EPP). All EPP patients reported cutaneous symptoms
   compared with 58\% of VP and 5\% of HCP (P < .001). Mean age at symptom
   onset was 7 +/- 6 years in EPP and 25 +/- 15 years in VP (P < .001).
   Photosensitivity was the most common symptom in EPP (90\%). In VP
   photosensitivity (52\%), blistering (52\%) and scarring (74\%) were all
   common symptoms. In both VP and EPP, the dorsal hands/forearms were the
   most affected regions (>= 96\%), and in >= 78\%, symptoms occurred on an
   almost daily basis. All EPP patients changed their lifestyle due to
   cutaneous symptoms vs 57\% in VP. Major effect on quality of life was
   observed among EPP patients compared with a moderate effect in VP. No
   treatment was effective in EPP, while phototherapy and moisturizers were
   effective in 5 of 7 (71\%) VP patients.
   Conclusion This study sheds light on the cutaneous features of the GCP,
   which have a substantial effect on patients' quality of life.}},

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the November 2007 Iran Nuclear NIE in light of the
   intense public criticism it received. It assesses the reaction to the
   NIE's ``externals{''} (factors unrelated to their substantive content).
   Then it evaluates the NIE's ``internals{''} (their substantive content)
   in terms of the data available to the U.S. at the time of the NIE, the
   impact of subsequent data on Iran's nuclear activities up to 2007, and
   the accuracy of NIE estimates of the future beyond 2007. Its main
   findings are: (1) NIE assessments of the past and present were extremely
   well-founded given the data available to the U.S. at the time. (2) Much
   of the data reported after the NIE's publication on Iran's pre-2007
   activities confirmed NIE assessments. (3) The areas where post-NIE data
   most challenged those assessments had been flagged as areas of
   uncertainty; although that data can reasonably be interpreted to be
   conclude that Iran resumed its nuclear weapons program, the very
   substantial activities halted in 2003 and the very limited contributions
   of post-2003 activities are more consistent with the NIE judgment that
   the program remained halted and Iran was keeping its options open to
   resume the program in the future. (4) The NIE's judgments of the future
   beyond 2007 seem to have held up very well. (5) The accusations made
   about the role of three former State Department officials, the alleged
   fabrication and manipulation of intelligence, and the putative skewing
   of the NIE to thwart U.S. policy were all egregiously false.}},

Title = {{Bagging and non-bagging treatment on the dissipation and residue of four

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Bananas are vulnerable to disease and insect pests after
   producing fruit. In order to increase the yield and produce high-quality
   fruit, the insecticides and fungicides are mixed and applied 2-3 times
   on banana, then the fruit is bagged. Buprofezin, imidacloprid,
   difenoconazole, and pyraclostrobin are widely used on banana. However,
   there is a lack of research on the effect of fruit bagging on pesticide
   dissipation and residues on bananas.
   RESULTS A versatile liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
   method with modified QuEChERS sample preparation has been developed for
   the determination of buprofezin, imidacloprid, difenoconazole, and
   pyraclostrobin in bananas. The recovery of four pesticides was
   satisfactory (74.96-98.63\%) with reasonable relative standard deviation
   (<= 8.78\%). In Hainan and Guangzhou, the half-lives of the four
   pesticides were 4.68-13.9 and 5.63-20.4 days in non-bagged and bagged
   bananas, respectively. The significance analysis of the half-lives in
   the two sites showed that the dissipation rates of the three pesticides
   (imidacloprid, difenoconazole, pyraclostrobin) on whole bananas were
   significantly decreased by the effect of bagging (P < 0.05). However,
   there was no significant difference in the degradation of half-life of
   buprofezin under bagging and without bagging (P > 0.05).
   CONCLUSION The high vapor pressure and the non-systemic property cause
   buprofezin to evaporate and dissipate the fastest among the four studied
   pesticides. The ultimate residues of four pesticides in bananas are
   lower than the maximum residue limits in China after three times of
   mixed applications under bagging or non-bagging. The results provide
   scientific data for evaluating the safety of four pesticides in banana
   bagging. (c) 2020 Society of Chemical Industry}},

Abstract = {{Reducing the usage of fishmeal in shrimp feed has been a demand for the
   sustainability of aquaculture. An 8-week feeding trial was performed to
   evaluate the potential application of fermented soya bean meal (FSBM)
   with Shewanella sp. MR-7 in shrimp diet. The diet with 30\% fishmeal was
   set as the control (FM), and four levels of FSBM (15\%, 30\%, 45\% and
   60\%, referred as F15, F30, F45 and F60) were formulated to replace
   fishmeal isonitrogenously. The growth performance, biochemical indexes,
   immune response, intestinal microbiome composition and response to
   ammonia stress were determined. Results showed that FSBM groups had
   comparable growth performance with FM group when the replacement level
   was not more than 45\%. Replacement of 60\% fishmeal with FSBM
   significantly depressed the trypsin activity and the expression of
   immune-related genes in hepatopancreas. Intestinal microbiome analysis
   showed the abundance of beneficial bacteria (Romboutsia) in F60 group
   decreased while potential pathogen (Vibrio and Fusibacter) enriched.
   Survival rate of F60 group was significantly lower when exposed to
   ammonia stress for 48 h. Taken together, FSBM with Shewanella sp. MR-7
   could reduce fishmeal level from 30\% to 16.5\% without inducing
   inferior performance on shrimp.}},

Abstract = {{The emergence of new shared-use mobility options such as bikeshare and
   ride-hailing services render the traditional dichotomy between personal
   vehicles and public transit somewhat irrelevant. Transportation planners
   and policymakers have yet to conclude whether these mobility
   technologies are complementing or competing against existing public
   transit services. The understanding of this relationship is vital given
   the increasing uncertainty of funding sources for transit services, but
   limited by the scarcity of meaningful data provided by the private
   ride-hailing industry. This study applies big data analytic tools on a
   unique travel data set to uncover the predictors motivating a
   half-billion transit, taxi, and bikeshare trips in rail station
   walksheds across Washington, DC. Study findings indicate travel cost and
   natural environment factors as well as land use diversity and network
   connectivity metrics significantly impact the likelihood for an
   individual to travel via taxi or bikeshare rather than rail.}},

Abstract = {{Relay-cropping of the novel oilseeds winter camelina (Camelina sativa
   L.) and pennycress (Thlaspi arvense L.) with short-season crops such as
   soybean {[}Glycine max (L.) Merr.] can provide economic and
   environmental incentives for adopting winter cover crop practices in the
   U.S. Upper Midwest. However, their ability to reduce nutrient loss in
   surface runoff is unknown. Accordingly, surface runoff and quality were
   evaluated during three seasonal phases (cover, intercrop, and soybean)
   over 2 yr in four cover crop-soybean treatments (pennycress, winter
   camelina, forage radish {[}Raphanus sativus L.], and winter rye
   {[}Secale cereale L.]) compared with no-till and chisel-till fallow
   treatments. Runoff was collected with Gerlach troughs and assessed for
   concentrations and loads of NO3--N, total mineral N, soluble reactive P
   (SRP), and total suspended solids (TSS). Cumulative runoff and nutrient
   loads were greater during the winter cover phase because of increased
   snow melt and freeze-thaw released nutrients from living vegetation. In
   contrast, cumulative TSS was greater during intercrop and soybean phases
   due to high-intensity rainfall events with an open soybean canopy.
   Average TSS loads during the intercrop phase were reduced by 75\% in
   pennycress compared with fallow and radish treatments. During the
   soybean phase, average TSS, total mineral N, and SRP loads were
   generally elevated in cover crop treatments compared with no-till.
   Overwintering cover crops may contribute to mobility of nutrients
   solubilized from living or decomposing vegetation; however, this was
   balanced by their potential to reduce runoff and TSS during
   high-intensity spring rains.}},

   assessment and therapeutic decisions were aided by objective
   measurement. The primary endpoint was improvement in the Movement

   Total Score. In one arm, objective measurement assisted doctors to alter
   therapy over successive visits until objective measurement scores were
   in target. Patients in the other arm were conventionally assessed and

   the objective measurement arm and 79 in the arm with conventional
   assessment and treatment. There were statistically significant
   improvements in the moderate clinically meaningful range in the

Title = {{Identifying the impacts of income inequality on CO2 emissions: Empirical
   evidences from OECD countries and non-OECD countries}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{277}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{The emergence of environmental quality challenges is rooted in social
   problems, which mainly come from income inequality and power gap. Income
   inequality and climate change have been highlighted as hindering the
   achievement of sustainable development and environmental protection
   globally. Though existing literature has estimated the influences of
   income inequality on CO2 emissions, relatively little is known about the
   long-run and short-run effects from a cross-national perspective.
   Therefore, the aim of this study is to shed light on the long-run and
   short-run relationships between income inequality and per capita CO2
   emissions based on balanced country-level panel dataset for 78 countries
   from 1990 to 2017. In order to understand how a country's economic level
   affects the link between inequality and CO2 emissions, this study
   classified the sample countries into three groups: OECD countries,
   low-income nonOECD countries, and high-income non-OECD countries. The
   FMOLS and DOLS model is applied to examine the relationship between the
   income inequality and per capita CO2 emission, meanwhile the estimates
   of an ARDL model revealed the long-run and short-run effects. Our
   empirical results indicate that there is a long-term cointegration
   relationship between income inequality and per capita CO2 emissions.
   Higher income inequality promotes emission reductions in OECD countries
   and high-income non-OECD countries, while the influences are
   insignificant in low-income non-OECD countries in the long run. Per
   capita income, carbon intensity, population size and urbanization were
   also considered in this study. The estimates of an ARDL model indicate
   that whilst income inequality does not have a significant impact on CO2
   emissions in the short run, per capita national income positively
   affects CO2 emissions, meaning that income growth will accelerate
   emissions. Carbon intensity positively affects CO2 emissions in the long
   term, indicating that increased income facilitates increased energy use
   and emissions, but that progress in CO2 recycling technology may
   ultimately reduce emissions. Neither population size nor urbanization
   rate exerted any obvious effects on per capita CO2 emissions. From a
   policy perspective, governments have an onerous task ahead of them in
   balancing economic efficiency and distributary justice. Lastly, we
   provide insights for policy makers that in order to realize the goal of
   emission reductions in the long run, it may be best to proceed by making
   reasonable national income redistribution policies and by adjusting the
   welfare system. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Novel approach for metal separation from spent lithium ion batteries
   based on dry-phase conversion}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{277}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{Wet leaching has been commonly applied to separate metals out from spent
   lithium ion batteries (LIBs), and large volumes of chemicals including
   acids and additives are required to reach high metal separation
   efficiencies. To reduce heavy use of chemicals for metal separation
   becomes significant in cleaner production. We propose a dry-phase
   process as chlorination conversion for separating metals from spent LIBs
   with low-stoichiometric amounts of additive. With ammonium chloride
   (NH4Cl) as the only additive, high metal separating efficiencies are
   achieved. Based on theoretical analysis and experimental investigation,
   it was found that chlorination conversion was promoted in a relatively
   closed environment and the suitable reaction temperature was between 623
   K and 800 K. By parameter optimization, nearly 100\% extracting
   efficiencies of Li and Co were achieved at 673 K for 20 min with the
   mass ratio of w(LiCoO2)/w(NH4Cl) as 1:2 under air atmosphere.
   Furthermore, the reaction mechanism was described as a two-step process
   which could be illustrated as the dry-extraction of LiCoO2. Finally, an
   acid-free approach was developed to realize the efficient metal
   extraction from cathode materials of spent LIBs. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Envelope analysis is a dominant approach in detecting modulated fault
   signals in rotating machinery. The Hilbert transform is a popular method
   used to obtain envelopes. However, envelopes based on the Hilbert
   transform are only suitable for narrowband signals. Signals are usually
   filtered before envelope demodulation, which leads to the challenging
   issue of filter selection. A modulated fault signal detection method
   using the upper and lower envelopes of the signals is proposed. This
   method can demodulate the modulated fault signals directly from the raw
   data, which can include wideband and narrowband signals. The proposed
   method uses a simple algebraic operation instead of a transform
   function, so it is convenient in practical applications. It is tested
   with some simulated signals and some real-measured data. The test
   results show that the method can effectively demodulate a modulated
   fault signal directly from the raw data.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we described the facile synthesis of Au core flower

   accelerates electron transfer rate but also provides more effective
   active sites for H2O2 reaction, therefore making the sensor based on
   Au@Co3O4 exhibit an excellent performance for H2O2 analysis with a
   linear range of 0.2 mu M-7.1 mM, a high sensitivity of 722.4 mu A mM(-1)

   cementitious material: Comparison with coal combustion fly ash}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{277}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{This study aims to evaluate the potential of sugarcane bagasse ash
   (SCBA) as a supplementary cementitious material (SCM) in terms of
   composition. Using coal-combustion fly ash (CFA) as the benchmark, SCBA
   is characterized thoroughly using multiple tools to determine and
   compare particle size, particle morphology, chemical composition, glass
   content, element distribution and chemical status. It is found that SCBA
   has fine particle size (d(50) = 6.76 mu m, compared to 2.2 mu m of CFA),
   high glass content (78.5 wt\%, compared to 81 wt\% of CFA), and
   relatively stable chemical composition, making it a potential effective
   SCM. The glass content of SCBA is dominated by amorphous silica (77.2\%,
   compared to 53.6\% of CFA), which can lead to formation of secondary
   calcium silicate hydrates in pozzolanic reactions. However, SCBA
   contains no spherical glass grains but many porous grains, which may
   compromise the workability of fresh-state cement-based materials.
   Another two detriments of SCBA are high carbon and potassium contents,
   which could potentially interfere the performance of cement-based
   materials. However, due to their existence forms (i.e., either light or
   dissolvable, as revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy), these
   detrimental effects can be mitigated through washing. A
   literature-survey based analysis shows that the ash samples adopted in
   this study are representative, so the conclusions drawn from this study
   are generally meaningful. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Resistivity characteristics during horizontal-layered electrolysis
   desaturation of calcareous sand}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{279}},
Month = {{DEC 20}},
Abstract = {{The electrolysis desaturation method is a novel method for treating
   liquefiable sand. However, the mechanisms of the electrolysis
   desaturation method are unclear. X-ray computed tomography (X-CT) tests
   were conducted calcareous sand to investigate the behavior of the gas
   bubbles inside the sample during the electrolysis process. The
   temperature inside the calcareous sand and the resistivity of the sand
   between the electrodes were monitored during desaturation. The results
   show that five distinct stages of resistivity variation in sand can be
   identified over the whole process of electrolysis. All the stages were
   controlled by the temperature and the gas bubbles generated during
   electrolysis. The bubbles generated during electrolysis are formed and
   stored in sand voids by two modes: capillary invasion and the formation
   of small bubbles, resulting in a slight increase in the resistivity of
   the sand; or displacement of the sand particles and the formation of
   large bubbles, resulting in a significant increase in the resistivity of
   the sand. The cathode has a significant effect on the behavior of the
   bubbles, and the saturation around the cathode is always lower than that
   in other zones throughout the process of electrolysis. Compared with
   McNeill's function, a cubic function relationship is more suitable for
   describing the relationship between the resistivity and saturation of
   calcareous sand during electrolysis. The end of stage II of the
   resistivity variation, that is, when the resistivity of the sand stops
   declining, is the right time to end the electrolysis. This study
   improves our understanding of the physical processes of electrolysis
   desaturation and provides insights into the potential application of
   electrolysis desaturation in the prevention and treatment of sand
   liquefaction.}},

Abstract = {{Compared with ordinary cement concrete, cement-treated base (CTB)
   material consumes much less cement and water, and its mechanical
   properties are also significantly different. The macroscopic properties
   of CTB are determined by microstructure. In order to understand the
   mechanical performance of in-service CTB, it is of great importance to
   investigate its microscopic structure and properties. In the study, the
   microscopic mechanical, structural, and chemical characteristics of the
   mortar and interfacial transition zone (ITZ) of in-service CTB were
   investigated through micro-scale characterizations. The results
   indicated the aggregate-mortar interface of in-service CTB is much
   weaker than that of concrete. A large number of micro-cracks and
   micro-pores were distributed in the ITZs and mortar. The micro-scale
   modulus of ITZ was approximately 85.6\% of the modulus of the mortar and
   showed high variance. More compacted cement paste structure is
   beneficial to improve the mechanical properties of CTB. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{The rapid development of flexible electronics motivates the design and
   synthesis of stable hydrogels that possess good stretchability and
   conductivity under harsh environment. The long-term durability of
   traditional hydrogels generally fails at high temperatures. In this
   work, a high-temperature-tolerant, self-healable hybrid hydrogel showing
   excellent water-locking and adhesive properties was developed through
   ultraviolet curing of acrylamide (AM) and hyper-branched
   polyethyleneimine (PEI) in highly salted ethylene glycol-water solution.
   Ethylene glycol was used as a crystallization inhibitor and greatly
   enhanced the solubility of sodium acetate (NaAc). The fabricated
   hydrogel can retain 75 \% of its initial weight for 9 hours at 100
   degrees C or 88 \% of its initial weight for 77 hours at 15 \% relative
   humidity (RH) environment. The dehydrated gel was flexible (tensile
   strain > 1700 \%) and conductive after storing at high temperatures
   (e.g. 100 degrees C) for a long term. Moreover, the highly salted
   hydrogel showed remarkable water adsorbing ability in the air: it can
   recover to its original weight after losing water at high temperature or
   low humidity conditions. In addition, the separated hydrogel fragments
   could heal into a single piece in 30 s, and the hydrogel showed
   reversible adhesiveness to both organic (6.2 kPa for pigskin, 28 kPa for
   wood) and inorganic (111.9 kPa for glass, 135.5 kPa for iron) substances
   for at least 5 cycles. This work provides a facile way of obtaining
   multi-functional conductive hydrogels that can work at high
   temperatures, demonstrating long-term prospects in engineering
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Background Although two novel synthesized compounds with tri-aryl
   structures;
   3-(4-chlorophenyl)-5-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1,2,4-oxadiaz
   ole (A) and
   3,5-bis-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-phenyl-4,5-dihydro-1,2,4-oxadiazole (B) have
   been previously demonstrated to possess remarkable anti-breast cancer
   activity, their cardiotoxicity remains a major concern due to their
   mechanism of action. To address this concern, we assessed the ability of
   these compounds to cause toxicity towards H9c2 cardiomyocytes as an in
   vitro model of cardiotoxicity. Methods Cytotoxic activity of both
   compounds was explored in vitro on H9c2 cells using MTT assay. Annexin
   V/PI method, intracellular ROS determination and mitochondrial membrane
   potential assay were applied to elucidate the mechanism of action of the
   cell death. Results MTT assay revealed a concentration- and
   time-dependent cardiotoxicity. Findings of apoptosis by double staining
   with annexin V and propidium iodide divulged no cell death including
   apoptosis and necrosis at the concentration that were effective to
   inhibit cancer cells proliferation (10 mu M) at 24 and 48 h.
   Furthermore, flow cytometric measurement of membrane potential and ROS
   determination using DCFH-DA verified the safe concentration of the
   compounds against H9c2 cells with no cardiotoxic effect. However, the
   higher concentration of the compounds could induce cell death through
   ROS-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction. Conclusions Altogether, the
   results represented two novel chemical molecules possessing anti-breast
   cancer activity with minimum cardiac side effect.}},

Abstract = {{Saudi Arabia has plentiful freely accessible solar energy with daily
   total Direct Normal Irradiance on the higher side. Furthermore, because
   of its extensive desert land with over 2 million km(2) expanse and high
   clearance index, the country could be a successful contender for
   accommodating the High Concentrator Photovoltaic (HCPV) technology. This
   technology, which assimilates Fresnel lens, has drawn more attention
   particularly after presenting III-V Multi-Junction solar cells for
   terrestrial uses since they keep achieving new conversion efficiency
   accomplishments. This article evaluates the HCPV performance in Saudi
   Arabia using direct normal irradiance data gathered in recent times. To
   undertake this assessment, a validated developed optical simulation
   using a ray-tracing technique is employed to evaluate the maximum and
   average power output that may be gathered using a single HCPV unit in
   the primary regions and cities in the nation. Results indicate that the
   highest values for average and maximum annual power yield belong to the
   Western Inland area with one HCPV unit having a Fresnel lens with a
   0.25x0.25 m(2) aperture area, and those values are over 36 and 59 kWh,
   respectively. Concerning cities, Tabuk has HCPV unit producing the
   highest average annual yield greater than 39 kWh while the maximum
   annual yield crosses 60 kWh. Hence, the yearly electrical energy yield
   of 194 such units that use an area less than 12.2 m(2) corresponds to
   approximately 33\% of the electricity demanded yearly by a typical home
   in Saudi Arabia, which includes heavy energy-consuming devices like air
   conditioners. Additionally, the estimated pollution potentially
   displaced by these units as per the global warming potential indicator
   is around eight tons of CO2 annually.}},

   in West Azerbaijan Province, Northwestern Iran}},
Journal = {{BMC ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},

Month = {{DEC 19}},
Abstract = {{Background The characteristics of a larval habitat is an important
   factor which affects the breeding pattern and population growth of
   mosquitoes Information about the larval habitat characteristics and
   pupal productivity can be utilized for the surveillance of the level of
   population growth, species diversity, and preferred breeding sites of
   mosquitoes, which are important aspects of integrated vector control. In
   the present study, mosquito larvae were collected from 22 natural
   habitats in five counties of the West Azerbaijan Province in the
   Northwest of Iran during May-November 2018. Physicochemical
   characteristics of the habitats were investigated. These included
   alkalinity, chloride (Cl) content, water temperature (degrees C),
   turbidity (NTU), Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) (ppm), Electrical
   Conductivity (EC) (mu S/cm), and acidity (pH). The index of affinity
   between the collected species was calculated using Fager \& McGowan
   test. Results A total of 2715 specimens were collected and identified.
   Seven different species belonging to four genera were identified in our
   study sites. The species included, Culex pipiens Linnaeus 1758, Culex
   theileri Theobald 1903, Culex mimeticus Noe 1899, Culex modestus Ficalbi
   1947, Culiseta longiareolata Macquart 1838, Anopheles maculipennis
   Meigen 1818complex, and Aedes caspius Pallas 1771. There was a
   significant difference in chloride content and water temperature
   preferences among the different species (P < 0.05). Also, there was no
   significant difference in pH, Alkalinity, Turbidity, TDS, and EC
   preferences among the different species (P > 0.05). The affinity between
   the pair of species Cx. mimeticus/Cs. longiareolata was 0.526. There was
   no affinity between other pairs of species or the affinity was very
   weak. Conclusions The physicochemical and biological characteristics of
   mosquito larval habitats play an important role in zoning of areas
   suitable for breeding and distribution. Surveillance of these
   characteristics can provide valuable information for entomological
   monitoring of mosquito vectors and for designing targeted control
   programs. Also, further studies should be undertaken in a wider
   geographical area, taking into account the complex characteristics of

Abstract = {{The preparation of the fluorescent diblock copolymer was carried out
   between poly(tetrahydrofuran) (PTHF) and poly(epsilon-caprolactone)
   (PCL) via bulk and ring-opening polymerization (ROP) method by using two
   different dyes such as fluorescent methyl red (MR) and eosin b (EB) as
   lone chemical initiators at 160 degrees C under N-2 atmosphere for two
   hours. All the prepared homopolymer and diblock copolymer were examined
   by NMR and FT-IR like analytical instruments. The molecular weight of
   the diblock copolymer was higher than the homopolymer. The TGA results
   showed that the thermal stability of PTHF in the diblock copolymer was
   lower when compared with dye end capped PCL. In this work, the ROP
   efficiency of two different dye-based initiators is compared and their
   results are critically analyzed. The -OH group-containing EB exhibited
   excellent results. The dye conjugated polymer was prepared by a

Abstract = {{Mucinous adenocarcinoma of the perianal region is an oncologic rarity
   posing a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma for treating oncologists.
   This is due to the low number of reported cases, compounded by the lack
   of definitive therapeutic guidelines. It accounts for 2\% to 3\% of all
   gastrointestinal malignancies and is historically known to arise from
   chronic anal fistulas and ischiorectal or perianal abscesses. We hereby
   report an interesting case of perianal mucinous adenocarcinoma in a
   66-year-old male initially treated for a horseshoe abscess with complex
   fistulae. He presented with a 6-month history of a discharging growth in
   perianal region and painful defecation associated with occasional blood
   mixed stools. An incisional biopsy from the ulcer revealed mucinous
   adenocarcinoma. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan and
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed a localized perianal growth
   which involves the internal and external sphincter as well as suspicious
   involvement in the posterior aspect of the levator ani/puborectalis
   sling, which was further confirmed with colonoscopy (see figures). With
   no preset treatment protocol for this rare entity, he was managed with
   an abdominoperineal resection (APR) and vertical rectus abdominis
   myocutaneous flap (VRAM) tissue reconstruction. He had a turbulent
   postoperative period including intestinal obstruction secondary to
   internal herniation of bowel resulting in flap failure. The subsequent
   perineal wound was managed conservatively with advanced wound care and
   has since completely healed.}},

Abstract = {{Team semantics is a highly general framework for logics which describe

   interventionist counterfactuals and causal dependencies, such as those
   that arise in manipulationist theories of causation (Pearl, Hitchcock,
   Woodward, among others). We show that the ``causal teams{''} we
   introduce in the present paper can be used for modelling some classical
   counterfactual scenarios which are not captured by the usual causal
   models. We then analyse the basic properties of our counterfactual
   languages and discuss extensively the differences with respect to the

Pages = {{23-36}},

Abstract = {{Over past decades, low and middle-income countries have experienced
   considerable expansion of agricultural land, yet this effect on growth
   has not been examined The following paper shows that the Solow-Swan
   growth model can be extended to the case whereby arable land is
   expanding, as originally suggested by Solow (1956). This extension
   indicates that land expansion boosts growth, and this effect increases
   with the relative share of land in income. An empirical analysis over
   1990-2018 for 138 low and middle-income countries supports this finding.
   The growth impact of land expansion over 1990-2018 varied significantly
   across the sample of countries depending on how much income was derived
   from land. This result explains why countries dependent on agriculture
   have engaged in extensive land expansion: it boosts overall growth.
   However, these growth benefits must be weighed against the considerable
   environmental costs of converting forests and other natural habitat to
   more agricultural land, such as increased carbon emissions, loss of
   ecosystem services and biodiversity, risk of disease, and impacts on
   local livelihoods.}},

Abstract = {{Within the short timeframe of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been
   increasing interest in its potential impact on psychological stress and
   sleep. Using standardized self-report measures, we examined differences
   in stress and sleep by comparing responses from three independent
   samples of undergraduates in the United States. Samples were obtained
   prior to COVID-19 (Spring 2019) and at two periods during the pandemic
   (Spring 2020 and Summer 2020) which corresponded to an increasing impact
   of COVID-19 at the local level. Within the combined sample of 1222
   students, 94\% identified as Hispanic. Contrary to our hypotheses,
   stress, sleep quality and insomnia were not significantly higher in the
   samples collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in support of
   our hypotheses, bedtime and waketime were significantly later during the
   pandemic, and sleep duration was significantly longer. Although scores
   on the global measure of sleep quality did not differ across semesters,
   supplemental exploratory analyses demonstrated a more complex picture of
   differences in sleep variables. Among the findings, there was evidence
   of greater sleep latency, greater sleep medication use and poorer sleep
   efficiency during the pandemic. Our results suggest that, within the US
   college student population, COVID-19's impact on stress and sleep may
   not be entirely negative.}},

Volume = {{49}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objectives Dental caries is a major oral health problem among indigenous
   people worldwide, but knowledge on this issue among the indigenous Sami
   people in Norway is scarce. The aim of the study was to describe dental
   caries experience in an adult population in core Sami areas of Northern
   Norway and to assess the corresponding associations with
   socio-demographic, socioeconomic and oral health-related behavioural
   factors.
   Methods This cross-sectional study is based on data from the Dental
   Health in the North study (2033 participants aged 18-75 years). A
   questionnaire was used to collect data on socio-demographic,
   socioeconomic and oral health-related behavioural factors. Clinical
   examinations were performed by dentists and dental hygienists at Public
   Dental Service (PDS) clinics in core Sami areas of Northern Norway.
   Results About 68\% (n = 1380) of participants reported Sami ethnicity,
   and the mean number of decayed (D), missed (M) and filled (F) teeth (T)
   was 16.2 (standard deviation {[}SD] = 6.7). The mean DMFT was 15.7 (SD =
   6.7) among Sami and 17.0 (SD = 6.7) among non-Sami. The mean DT among
   Sami was 1.0 (SD = 1.6), with a significant, higher prevalence among
   coastal Sami (DT = 1.3, SD = 1.8) than inland Sami (DT = 0.8, SD = 1.5).
   Living in the coastal region, consumption of sugary soft drinks several
   times a week or daily, toothbrushing less than daily and irregular
   dental visits were associated with DT.
   Conclusions Caries experience among adults in core Sami areas of
   Northern Norway was common. Dental caries were more common in the
   coastal than the inland region, with minor differences in caries
   experience between Sami and non-Sami people within these regions.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Haemodialysis can negatively impact quality of life and
   mental health. Arts-based interventions used successfully in other
   settings to improve health and well-being, could help address the impact
   of haemodialysis. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and
   acceptability of conducting a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of an
   arts-based intervention for patients receiving haemodialysis.
   Methods: A parallel convergent mixed-methods design was used, including
   a pilot cluster RCT and qualitative process evaluation.
   Phase 1 evaluated recruitment and retention rates through a pilot
   cluster RCT at a single haemodialysis unit in Northern Ireland.
   Participants included patients who received haemodialysis for ESKD, were
   over the age of 18 and had the capacity to consent. These participants
   were randomised to the intervention or control group according to their
   haemodialysis shift. The intervention involved six one-hour, one-to-one
   facilitated arts sessions during haemodialysis.
   Phase 2 explored intervention and trial acceptability through a
   qualitative process evaluation using semi-structured interviews based on
   the RE-AIM framework. Participants included 13 patients who participated
   in phase 1 of the study, including 9 participants from the experimental
   group and four participants from the control group, and nine healthcare
   professionals who were present on the unit during implementation.
   Results Out of 122 outpatient haemodialysis patients, 94 were assessed
   as eligible for participation. Twenty-four participants were randomised,
   meaning 80\% of the target sample size was recruited and the attrition
   rate at 3 months was 12.5\% (n = 3). Participants viewed the arts as
   more accessible and enjoyable than anticipated following implementation.
   All participants who started the intervention (n = 11) completed the
   full six sessions. Qualitative benefits of the intervention suggest
   improvements in mental well-being. Patient choice and facilitation were
   important factors for successful implementation.
   Conclusion An arts-based intervention for patients receiving
   haemodialysis is acceptable for both patients and healthcare
   professionals, and a definitive trial is feasible. The intervention may
   help improve mental-wellbeing in patients receiving haemodialysis, but
   this requires further investigation in a definitive trial.}},

Abstract = {{Lufenuron, a molecule that belongs to the chitin synthesis inhibitors
   group of insect growth regulators, has a still unclear mode of action,
   but probably it affects chitin synthesis at a post-transcriptional
   level. In this work, we report the effects of lufenuron on nutrition and
   reproduction in adult females of Anthonomus grandis, the main
   neotropical cotton pest and tried to link the effects on peritrophic
   matrix (PM) with egg viability. After Lufenuron treatment A. grandis
   females presented weight loss and less accumulation of protein and
   lipids probably due to PM breakdown. Also, treated females produce the
   same quantity of eggs as the control, although eggs from
   lufenuron-treated females were less viable. After morphological and
   histochemical analysis, we have noticed that oocytes from
   lufenuron-treated females contained less protein. Finally,
   lufenuron-treated females produced at least nine times less vitellogenin
   (AgraVg) RNA than control females. We specifically showed that lufenuron
   treatment caused PM disruption and it has probably led to vitellogenin
   (AgraVg) downregulation in females culminating in egg unviability. The
   effect of lufenuron on PM leads to insect malnutrition, and this
   malnutrition downregulates vitellogenin among other genes. This is the
   first work that describes and tries to correlate the lufenuron effects
   on adult females.}},

Abstract = {{Clinical signs of liver lobe torsion in rabbits are often nonspecific
   and mimic those that are also generally detected with gastrointestinal
   stasis. Nonspecific clinical signs may result in pursuit of full-body
   imaging such as computed tomography (CT). The aim of this multicenter,
   retrospective, case series study was to describe CT findings of liver
   lobe torsion in a group of rabbits. Computed tomography studies of six
   rabbits with confirmed liver lobe torsion by surgery or necropsy were
   evaluated. The caudate liver lobe was affected in six out of six rabbits
   and was enlarged, rounded, hypoattenuating, heterogeneous, and minimally
   to noncontrast enhancing, with scant regional peritoneal effusion.
   Precontrast, mean Hounsfield units (HU) of the torsed liver lobe (39.3
   HU {[}range, 24.4-48.1 HU]) were lower than mean HU of normal liver
   (55.1 HU {[}range, 49.6-60.8 HU]), with a mean torsed:normal HU ratio of
   0.71 (range, 0.49-0.91). Postcontrast, mean HU of the torsed liver lobe
   (38.4 HU {[}range, 19.7-48.9 HU]) were also lower than mean HU of normal
   liver (108.4 HU {[}range, 84.5-142.0 HU]), with a lower postcontrast
   mean torsed:normal HU ratio of 0.35 (range, 0.14-0.48) compared to
   precontrast. Mean HU of torsed liver lobes had little difference pre-
   and postcontrast (postcontrast HU 1.0 times the average precontrast HU
   {[}range, 0.81-1.1]), and contrast enhancement of the torsed liver lobes
   was on average 50\% lower than in normal liver. Liver lobe torsion
   should be considered in rabbits with an enlarged, hypoattenuating,
   heterogeneous, minimally to noncontrast enhancing liver lobe,
   particularly the caudate lobe, and scant regional peritoneal effusion.}},

Abstract = {{The maned wolf, Chrysocyon brachyurus, is a near-threatened carnivore
   inhabiting the Brazilian Cerrado. Few studies have been conducted on
   this species, and even fewer have explored its ophthalmological
   characteristics. Vision is critical to wild canids; thus, this study
   aimed to provide a morphoquantitative description of the bulbar
   conjunctiva of the maned wolf using cytological and histological
   analyses. Ten healthy maned wolves from a conservational centre,
   including 4 females and 6 males aged 1-12 years (6.5 +/- 2.8), were
   included in the study. The samples for cytological analysis were
   collected from the inferior conjunctival sac using a cytobrush, and
   conjunctival tissue was collected for histological analysis from the
   temporal canthus zone. The cytological samples were stained using the
   Papanicolaou method, and the histological sections were stained using
   haematoxylin and eosin, Periodic acid-Schiff, picrosirius red and
   Masson's trichrome stains. The cytological samples were studied for
   stain quality, and the different cell types were counted. Histological
   examination was used to determine tissue types in the conjunctiva and
   their proportions. Analyses revealed a stratified squamous epithelium
   with some goblet cells and eventual pigmentation in the basal layer.
   Loose connective tissue with the presence of some mononuclear and
   polymorphonuclear cells was also observed. The epithelium of the maned
   wolf's bulbar conjunctiva resembles that of dogs and other carnivore
   species; furthermore, its physiological and pathological responses were
   similar to those of other carnivore species.}},

Abstract = {{Bolivian migration in borax and sulphur high-altitude mining was
   fundamental in sustaining industrial capitalism in northern Chile. In
   this paper, we quantify and characterize Bolivian migration in the
   border mining camps of the municipality of Ollague, through the analysis
   of 335 migratory files, dating from 1888 to 1946. We focus on the
   Bolivian presence in eight villages and camps involved in sulphur and
   borax mining. We present the entry periods of Bolivian workers, as well
   as their origin, trade and profession, gender, marital status, age, and
   literacy. Results give an account of the central role played by the
   Bolivian migrant labour force for the development of non-metallic and
   high-altitude mining industries in the region. It is concluded that the
   capitalist expansion in the Chilean border was sustained by an ethnic
   subsidiarity of an international subordinate workforce.}},

Title = {{Looking represents choosing in toddlers: Exploring the equivalence

Journal = {{INFANCY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In the two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) paradigm, manual responses
   such as pointing have been widely used as measures to estimate cognitive
   abilities. While pointing measurements can be easily collected, coded,
   analyzed, and interpreted, absent responses are often observed
   particularly when adopting these measures for toddler studies, which
   leads to an increase of missing data. Although looking responses such as
   preferential looking can be available as alternative measures in such
   cases, it is unknown how well looking measurements can be interpreted as
   equivalent to manual ones. This study aimed to answer this question by
   investigating how accurately pointing responses (i.e., left or right)
   could be predicted from concurrent preferential looking. Using
   pre-existing videos of toddlers aged 18-23 months engaged in an
   intermodal word comprehension task, we developed models predicting
   manual from looking responses. Results showed substantial prediction
   accuracy for both the Simple Majority Vote and Machine Learning-Based
   classifiers, which indicates that looking responses would be reasonable
   alternative measures of manual ones. However, the further exploratory
   analysis revealed that when applying the created models for data of
   toddlers who did not produce clear pointing responses, the estimation
   agreement of missing pointing between the models and the human coders
   slightly dropped. This indicates that looking responses without pointing
   were qualitatively different from those with pointing. Bridging two
   measurements in forced-choice tasks would help researchers avoid wasting
   collected data due to the absence of manual responses and interpret
   results from different modalities comprehensively.}},

Title = {{Both contextual regularity and selective attention affect the reduction

Abstract = {{Predictive coding model of perception postulates that the primary
   objective of the brain is to infer the causes of sensory inputs by
   reducing prediction errors (i.e., the discrepancy between expected and
   actual information). Moreover, prediction errors are weighted by their
   precision (i.e., inverse variance), which quantifies the degree of
   certainty about the variables. There is accumulating evidence that the
   reduction of precision-weighted prediction errors can be affected by
   contextual regularity (as an external factor) and selective attention
   (as an internal factor). However, it is unclear whether the two factors
   function together or separately. Here we used electroencephalography
   (EEG) to examine the putative interaction of contextual regularity and
   selective attention on this reduction process. Participants were
   presented with pairs of regular and irregular quartets in attended and
   unattended conditions. We found that contextual regularity and selective
   attention independently modulated the N1/MMN where the repetition effect
   was absent. On the P2, the two factors respectively interacted with the
   repetition effect without interacting with each other. The results
   showed that contextual regularity and selective attention likely affect
   the reduction of precision-weighted prediction errors in distinct
   manners. While contextual regularity finetunes our efficiency at
   reducing precision-weighted prediction errors, selective attention seems
   to modulate the reduction process following the Matthew effect of
   accumulated advantage.}},

Title = {{Recommendations to improve physical activity prescription for the cystic
   fibrosis population: an Irish perspective}},
Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 19}},
Abstract = {{Background Physical activity (PA) is a well-established therapeutic
   modality for the maintenance and improvement of long-term health in
   cystic fibrosis (CF). Healthcare professionals (HCP) are considered
   credible and well-placed messengers for the delivery of PA advice.
   Limited research exists investigating the extent of PA prescription
   within CF care. This study aimed to identify Irish HCP i) knowledge and
   practice of, and ii) motivators and barriers to PA prescription, and
   iii) proposed strategies to optimize PA promotion and prescription in CF
   populations. Methods HCP from six designated CF centres in Ireland and
   members of the national physiotherapy CF clinical interest group were
   invited to participate. Following an expression of interest, each HCP (n
   = 81) received an email containing the plain language statement and link
   to the online survey. 48 HCP (physiotherapists n = 24, other n = 24)
   completed the 30-item investigator-developed survey, which included
   multiple choice single answer, matrix style and open-ended questions.
   Results Most HCP (81\%) acknowledged that discussing PA with CF patients
   was part of their professional role. Almost all physiotherapists (95\%)
   reported having sufficient knowledge regarding PA prescription, compared
   to 17\% of other HCP. All physiotherapists reported discussing PA at
   every patient interaction, with 81\% employing the current consensus
   guidelines, compared to 33 and 5\% of other HCP, respectively. Among the
   most common barriers reported by HCP to recommending PA to their CF
   patients were; lack of motivation and compliance among patients to
   adhere to PA advice, limited availability of PA programmes to refer
   their patients to, limited time with patients during clinic visits and a
   lack of knowledge regarding PA prescription for CF care. Three-quarters
   of HCP reported a need to improve PA services for CF patients in
   Ireland. Conclusion As people with CF are living longer, it is
   imperative that HCP are expanding their scope of practice to include
   discussions around PA at every patient visit. Formal educational
   opportunities in the form of continuing professional development
   programmes are warranted for CF HCP to optimize long-term patient
   management and outcomes. There is also a need to develop
   patient-centered and evidence-based PA programmes underpinned by
   theories of behaviour change to enhance motivation and compliance among
   CF patients.}},

Title = {{The inhibitory effect of curcumin via fascin suppression through
   JAK/STAT3 pathway on metastasis and recurrence of ovary cancer cells}},
Journal = {{BMC WOMENS HEALTH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 19}},
Abstract = {{Background Fascin is an actin-binding protein and highly expressed in
   ovarian cancer cells. It is associated with metastasis of cancer and may
   be a useful prognostic factor. Anticancer activity of curcumin is
   related to its effect on several signaling mechanisms. Although there
   have been many reports regarding the anticancer properties of curcumin,
   its inhibitory effects on migration and invasion of ovarian cancer
   cells, particularly in the context of fascin expression, have not been
   reported. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of
   curcumin on fascin expression in ovarian cancer cells and to propose a
   possible mechanism for the anticancer activity of curcumin through
   reduced fascin expression. Methods SKOV3, human epithelial ovary cancer
   cell line, was cultured with curcumin at various dose and duration. The
   fascin was quantified using cell viability test and Western blot. To
   determine the effect of curcumin on the upstream pathway of fascin
   expression, the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
   (STAT3) was analyzed by sandwich-ELISA. Attachment assay, migration
   assay and invasion assay were analyzed to approve the change of cellular
   invasiveness of ovary cancer after curcumin. To determine the
   morphological changes of ovarian cancer cells by curcumin,
   immunofluorescence was performed. Results MTS assays showed that cell
   viability was different at various concentration of curcumin, and as
   concentration increased, cell viability tended to decrease. Curcumin
   appears to suppress fascin expression, even with a minimal concentration
   and short exposure time. Also, curcumin may suppress fascin expression
   in ovarian cancer cells through STAT3 downregulation. The attachment
   assay, migration assay and invasion assay of the ovarian cancer cells
   exhibited a statistically significant decrease. Immunofluorescence
   revealed a change of cell shape from a typical form of uninfluenced
   cells to a more polygonal appearance, with a significant reduction in
   filopodia formation. Conclusions Curcumin reduces fascin expression
   through JAK/STAT3 pathway inhibition, which interferes with the cellular
   interactions essential for the metastasis and recurrence of ovarian
   cancer cells. Higher curcumin concentrations and longer exposure times
   concomitantly decreased fascin expression.}},

Title = {{Association of Leptin With Obesity and Insulin Resistance}},
Journal = {{CUREUS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 19}},
Abstract = {{Introduction
   Leptin, a hormone released by the body to regulate energy balance by
   inhibiting hunger, decreases fat storage in adipocytes. Leptin is
   thought to play some role in obesity and insulin resistance. In this
   study, our aim is to see the association of leptin with obesity and
   insulin resistance.
   Methods
   This case-control study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in
   Pakistan from January 2020 to April 2020. Ninety-two participants with
   BMI greater than 25 kg/m(2), with no known comorbidities were enrolled
   in the study after informed consent. Ninety-two participants, who came
   to the outpatient department without a history of chronic disease, with
   BMI less than 25 kg/m(2) were enrolled as a control group. Data were
   collected via self-structured questionnaires. Their blood was drawn and
   sent to the laboratory for cholesterol levels, insulin resistance and
   leptin levels.
   Results
   Serum leptin levels (51.24 +/- 18.12 vs. 9.10 +/- 2.99: p-value, <
   0.0001), serum cholesterol levels (198.2 +/- 32.1 vs. 151.2 +/- 21.2,
   p-value < 0.0001) and insulin resistance (7.9 +/- 2.1 vs. 6.3 +/- 1.9,
   p-value < 0.0001) were higher in obese patients.
   Conclusion
   As per the results of this study, obesity was associated with increase
   serum leptin levels and insulin resistance. Further multi-centric
   studies are required to prove the possible relationship, which might
   help devise plans to manage obesity.}},

Journal = {{POLITICAL STUDIES}},
Abstract = {{The World Trade Organization's dispute settlement mechanism is based on
   either bilateral bargaining or third-party rulings by a panel or the
   Appellate Body. When do countries utilize the multilateral procedure,
   and under what conditions do they opt for a bilateral agreement?
   Departing from previous studies emphasizing the role of the complainant
   in shaping the course of the dispute settlement mechanism, this article
   offers an explanation based on the strategic choices of respondents.
   This study suggests that the domestic political interests of respondent
   governments determine the use of the dispute settlement mechanism's
   multilateral track. We argue that respondent governments choose the
   multilateral track to seek political cover for domestically unpopular
   concessions to a complainant. Such cover is required when (1) the
   dispute at stake has high public salience and (2) the respondent faces
   an upcoming election. Our hypotheses are tested using World Trade

Title = {{``Who is watching the watchdog?{''}: ethical perspectives of sharing
   health-related data for precision medicine in Singapore}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL ETHICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 19}},
Abstract = {{Background We aimed to examine the ethical concerns Singaporeans have
   about sharing health-data for precision medicine (PM) and identify
   suggestions for governance strategies. Just as Asian genomes are
   under-represented in PM, the views of Asian populations about the risks
   and benefits of data sharing are under-represented in prior attitudinal
   research. Methods We conducted seven focus groups with 62 participants
   in Singapore from May to July 2019. They were conducted in three
   languages (English, Mandarin and Malay) and analysed with qualitative
   content and thematic analysis. Results Four key themes emerged: nuanced
   understandings of data security and data sensitivity; trade-offs between
   data protection and research benefits; trust (and distrust) in the
   public and private sectors; and governance and control options.
   Participants were aware of the inherent risks associated with data
   sharing for research. Participants expressed conditional support for
   data sharing, including genomic sequence data and information contained
   within electronic medical records. This support included sharing data
   with researchers from universities and healthcare institutions, both in
   Singapore and overseas. Support was conditional on the perceived social
   value of the research and appropriate de-identification and data
   security processes. Participants suggested that a data sharing oversight
   body would help strengthen public trust and comfort in data research for
   PM in Singapore. Conclusion Maintenance of public trust in data security
   systems and governance regimes can enhance participation in PM and data
   sharing for research. Contrary to themes in much prior research,
   participants demonstrated a sophisticated understanding of the inherent
   risks of data sharing, analysed trade-offs between risks and potential
   benefits of PM, and often adopted an international perspective.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MULTILINGUAL AND MULTICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT}},
Abstract = {{English Medium Instruction (EMI) research has mushroomed in response to
   the rapid increase in EMI courses in higher education (HE) worldwide.
   Despite concerns about the need for EMI teacher professional development
   (PD) there are few studies on PD in EMI. We present a study of EMI
   teacher PD which adopted a model of equal status collaborative research
   between a language specialist and two EMI teachers whereby the latter
   were presented with highly detailed analyses of their lessons over a
   period without evaluative commentary/feedback from the language
   specialist. Our findings suggest that the two teachers reacted
   enthusiastically to the model but one teacher felt a greater need to
   move towards an interactive pedagogy than the other. Possible
   explanations are given and suggestions for adapting future research are

Volume = {{51}},

Pages = {{77-94}},

Abstract = {{The data throughput of massive spectroscopic surveys in the course of
   each observation is directly coordinated with the number of optical
   fibers which reach their target. In this paper, we evaluate the safety
   and the performance of the astrobots coordination in SDSS-V by
   conducting various experimental and simulated tests. We illustrate that
   our strategy provides a complete coordination condition which depends on
   the operational characteristics of astrobots, their configurations, and
   their targets. Namely, a coordination method based on the notion of
   cooperative artificial potential fields is used to generate safe and
   complete trajectories for astrobots. Optimal target assignment further
   improves the performance of the used algorithm in terms of faster
   convergences and less oscillatory movements. Both random targets and
   galaxy catalog targets are employed to observe the coordination success
   of the algorithm in various target distributions. The proposed method is
   capable of handling all potential collisions in the course of
   coordination. Once the completeness condition is fulfilled according to
   initial configuration of astrobots and their targets, the algorithm
   reaches full convergence of astrobots. Should one assign targets to
   astrobots using efficient strategies, convergence time as well as the
   number of oscillations decrease in the course of coordination. Rare
   incomplete scenarios are simply resolved by trivial modifications of
   astrobots swarms' parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Despite existing national and institutional policies and interventions
   on gender-based violence (GBV), acts of GBV endure at universities in
   South Africa. Through narrative research inquiry, this focus piece
   reports on the experiences and perspectives of GBV of a first-year
   student at a university in South Africa. The findings presented reveal
   how she experienced feelings of vulnerability, silenced by ignorance,
   fear and powerlessness in a university residential space. She voices her
   disappointment regarding the reporting of the GBV incident, the
   disciplinary process, and the outcome thereof. Retrospectively, `Zinzi'
   provides possible recommendations from the ground up. This paper
   explores the complicated policy conversation of a young women-led
   initiative to find real solutions to real problems for young women
   within risky institutional spaces characterised by acts of GBV. For
   young women like `Zinzi', experiencing GBV first-hand as they entered
   the university space and voicing it can be recognised as a bold and
   valued contribution to fostering dialogue that can potentially lead to
   positive change. Only with young women-led policymaking can we expect
   institutions to give victims/survivors an intersectional safe space
   where women and men are unapologetic of who they are, fearless, and not
   angered by policies and practices meant to protect them - a space that
   transposes their powerlessness.}},

Abstract = {{Molybdenum oxide (MoOx) is attractive for applications as hole-selective
   contact in silicon heterojunction solar cells for its transparency and
   relatively high work function. However, the integration of MoOx stacked
   on intrinsic amorphous silicon (i)a-Si:H layer usually exhibits some
   issues that are still not fully solved resulting in degradation of
   electrical properties. Here, we propose a novel approach to enhance the
   electrical properties of (i)a-Si:H/MoOx contact. We manipulate the
   (i)a-Si:H interface via plasma treatment (PT) before MoOx deposition
   minimizing the electrical degradation without harming the optical
   response. Furthermore, by applying the optimized PT, we can reduce the
   MoOx thickness down to 3.5 nm with both open-circuit voltage and fill
   factor improvements. Our findings suggest that the PT mitigates the
   decrease of the effective work function of the MoOx (WFMoOx) thin layer
   when deposited on (i)a-Si:H. To support our hypothesis, we carry out
   electrical simulations inserting a dipole at the (i)a-Si:H/MoOx
   interface accounting the attenuation of WFMoOx caused by both MoOx
   thickness and dipole. Our calculations confirm the experimental trends
   and thus provide deep insight in critical transport issues.
   Temperature-dependent J-V measurements demonstrate that the use of PT
   improves the energy alignment for an efficient hole transport.}},

Abstract = {{Background The craniocervical flexion test (CCFT) is recommended when
   examining patients with neck pain related conditions and as a deep
   cervical retraining exercise option. During the execution of the CCFT
   the examiner should visually assess that the amount of craniocervical
   flexion range of motion (ROM) progressively increases. However, this
   task is very subjective. The use of inertial wearable sensors may be a
   user-friendly option to measure and objectively monitor the ROM. The
   objectives of our study were (1) to measure craniocervical flexion range
   of motion (ROM) associated with each stage of the CCFT using a wearable
   inertial sensor and to determine the reliability of the measurements and
   (2) to determine craniocervical flexion ROM targets associated with each
   stage of the CCFT to standardize their use for assessment and training
   of the deep cervical flexor (DCF) muscles. Methods Adults from a
   university community able to successfully perform the CCFT participated
   in this study. Two independent examiners evaluated the CCFT in two
   separate sessions. During the CCFT, a small wireless inertial sensor was
   adhered to the centre of the forehead to provide real-time monitoring
   and to record craniocervical flexion ROM. The intra- and inter-rater
   reliability of the assessment of craniocervical ROM was calculated. This
   study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of CEU San Pablo
   University (236/17/08). Results Fifty-six participants (18 males, 23
   females; mean {[}SD] age, 21.8 {[}3.45] years) were included in the
   study and successfully completed the study protocol. All interclass
   correlation coefficient (ICC) values indicated good or excellent
   reliability of the assessment of craniocervical ROM using a wearable
   inertial sensor. There was high variability between subjects on the
   amount of craniocervical ROM necessary to achieve each stage of the
   CCFT. Conclusions The use of inertial sensors is a reliable method to
   measure the craniocervical flexion ROM associated with the CCFT. The
   great variability in the ROM limits the possibility to standardize a set
   of targets of craniocervical flexion ROM equivalent to each of the
   pressure targets of the pressure biofeedback unit.}},

Abstract = {{Brain lateralization refers to hemispheric asymmetries in functions
   and/or neuroanatomical structures. Functional specialization in
   non-human animals has been mainly inferred through observation of
   lateralized motor responses and sensory perception. Only in a few cases
   has the influence of brain asymmetries on behaviour been described.
   Zebrafish has rapidly become a valuable model to investigate this issue
   as it displays epithalamic asymmetries that have been correlated to some
   lateralized behaviours. Here we investigated the relation between
   neuroanatomical or behavioural lateralization and anxiety using a
   light-dark preference test in adult zebrafish. In Experiment 1, we
   observed how scototaxis response varied as a function of behavioural
   lateralization measured in the detour task as turning preference in
   front of a dummy predator. In Experiment 2, foxD3:GFP transgenic adult
   zebrafish with left or right parapineal position, were tested in the
   same light-dark test as fish in Experiment 1. No correlation was found
   between the behaviour observed in the detour test and in the scototaxis
   test nor between the left- and right-parapineal fish and the scototaxis
   response. The consistency of results obtained in both experiments
   indicates that neither behavioural nor neuroanatomical asymmetries are
   related to anxiety-related behaviours measured in the light-dark test.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE Obesity and overweight are associated with an increased risk
   for cardiovascular disease. Since fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM)
   both contribute to total body weight (TBW), we characterized the
   post-heart transplantation (HT) change in TBW and its implications for
   outcomes.
   METHODS Post-HT changes in TBW, FM, and FFM were reviewed for 211 HT
   patients assessed during 1997-2017. Endpoints included cardiac allograft
   vasculopathy (CAV) and rejection.
   RESULTS Median TBW increased by 7.3\% at 1 year, with a significant rise
   in the obese category (28\% vs. 13\%, p < 0.001) and with FM versus FFM
   making the main contribution (23\% vs. 3\%, p < 0.001). When patients
   were divided according to median TBW change ({''}high{''} vs.
   ``low{''}), Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that 10-year freedom from CAV
   (log-rank p < 0.005) and rejection (log-rank p < 0.01) was significantly
   higher for the ``low{''} TBW change group. Consistently, multivariable
   analyses showed that the ``high{''} group was independently associated
   with significant 3.5-fold and 4.2-fold increased risks for CAV (95\% CI
   1.4-8.7, p = 0.01) and rejection (95\% CI 1.2-15.4, p = 0.03),
   respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS Weight gain, contributed mostly by FM, is independently
   associated with an increased risk for CAV and rejection. Follow-up
   emphasis should be placed on weight gain and preventative measures.}},

Journal = {{CUREUS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Parvovirus B19 (PVB19) is a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) virus, the only
   member of the Parvoviridae, which has a direct cytopathic effect on
   erythroid progenitor cells, resulting in an arrest of hematopoiesis and
   subsequent anemia. Less frequently, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia
   have been reported with the PVB19 infection. We report a rare case of
   chronic neutropenia due to PVB19 in a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
   patient. A 51-year-old male with a medical history of HIV presented to
   the Emergency Department (ED) with complaints of generalized weakness.
   His laboratory tests were significant for severe anemia and new
   neutropenia. PVB19 DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was positive.
   PVB19 immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG were reported negative. He was
   diagnosed with aplastic anemia from PVB19 and neutropenia. From June
   2013 to January 2019, the patient was admitted 23 times with severe
   neutropenia and anemia, and on each occasion, PVB19 DNA by PCR was
   positive. During these multiple admissions, he was treated with
   antibiotics for neutropenic fever, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
   aureus (MRSA) bacteremia, and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus
   aureus (MSSA) skin abscesses. On each occasion, he required multiple
   blood transfusions, and he received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)
   that resulted in significant improvement of absolute neutrophil count
   (ANC) count. He had bone biopsy twice, which showed normal maturation of
   the myeloid series and reduced erythroid progenitor cells consistent
   with PVB19 infection. PVB19 DNA by PCR remains positive to date.
   Immunocompromised individuals usually develop a chronic infection from
   PVB19, and rarely infection with PVB19 can cause severe neutropenia that
   can be longlasting and life-threatening. Early recognition and treatment
   with IVIG are the key to improve the clinical outcome.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose In response to a large trial, the World Health Organization
   broadened their recommendation on tranexamic acid to be used for
   post-partum hemorrhage. A 2013 French periodic safety update report
   warned of an abnormally high rate of renal cortical necrosis associated
   with tranexamic acid and other drugs for severe post-partum hemorrhage.
   We aimed to identify the reporting incidence of adverse thrombo-embolic
   events among women in child-bearing age who received tranexamic acid,
   with a focus on renal vascular and ischemic conditions. Methods We
   analyzed individual case safety reports (ICSRs) on renal vascular and
   ischemic conditions, pulmonary thrombotic and embolic conditions, and
   peripheral embolism and thrombosis from the database of the World Health
   Organization - Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC). ICSRs were
   restricted to reports including tranexamic acid as a suspected drug, sex
   reported as female, and reported age between 18 and 44 years. Reporting
   odds ratios (RORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CIs) were
   calculated by comparing ICSRs on tranexamic acid to all other drugs in
   VigiBase. Results Within 2245 included ICSRs on tranexamic acid, we
   identified 29 reports of adverse renal vascular and ischemic conditions,
   42 reports of pulmonary thrombotic and embolic conditions, and 41
   reports of peripheral embolism and thrombosis. RORs were statistically
   significant by 32.6-fold (32.62, 95\% CI: 22.50-47.29), 2.5-fold (2.52,
   95\% CI: 1.85-3.42), and 2.7-fold (2.67, 95\% CI: 1.96-3.64),
   respectively, when compared to any other drug within VigiBase.
   Conclusion Tranexamic acid might bear an increased risk for renal
   ischemic adverse drug events in women of child-bearing age.}},

Title = {{Time-resolved Mid-infrared Measurements of Hydrogen Peroxide in the
   Low-temperature Oxidation of Iso-octane in a Rapid Compression Machine}},
Journal = {{COMBUSTION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Time-resolved quantitative measurements of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in
   the low-temperature oxidation of iso-octane in a rapid compression
   machine have been performed using mid-infrared absorption spectroscopy.
   H2O2 was detected in the 8-mu m region, wherein H2O2 has the strongest
   absorption band. Owing to the weak interference of the absorption of
   iso-octane and H2O in the 8-mu m region, H2O and iso-octane were
   detected in the 1.4- and 3.5-mu m region, respectively. The
   cross-sections of H2O2 and H2O were calculated using parameters in the
   HITRAN database, and the iso-octane cross-section was measured using a
   rapid compression machine in the temperature and pressure ranges of
   417-700 K and 100-700 kPa, respectively. The time-resolved quantitative
   H2O2 profiles in the low-temperature oxidation of iso-octane at 0.77
   MPa, 642 and 660 K, and an equivalence ratio of 1.0 were successfully
   obtained. The H2O and iso-octane profiles were also obtained using this
   measurement method; the simultaneous measurements of the quantitative
   time profiles of multi-species in the low-temperature oxidation of fuels
   are also novel. Under experimental conditions, H2O2 was formed during
   the low-temperature oxidation of iso-octane, and its concentration
   gradually increased between the end of the low-temperature oxidation and
   start of the high-temperature oxidation. The calculated H2O2 profiles
   obtained using the latest chemical kinetic model of iso-octane showed
   the same tendency as the experimental profiles.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a heterogeneous inflammatory
   demyelinating disease. Iron distribution is altered in MS patients'
   brains, suggesting iron liberation within active lesions amplifies
   demyelination and neurodegeneration. Whether the amount and distribution
   of iron are similar or different among different MS immunopatterns is
   currently unknown.
   Methods We used synchrotron X-ray fluorescence imaging, histology, and
   immunohistochemistry to compare the iron quantity and distribution
   between immunopattern II and III early active MS lesions. We analyzed
   archival autopsy and biopsy tissue from 21 MS patients.
   Results Immunopattern II early active lesions contain 64\% more iron
   (95\% confidence interval {[}CI] = 17-127\%, p = 0.004) than
   immunopattern III lesions, and 30\% more iron than the surrounding
   periplaque white matter (95\% CI = 3-64\%, p = 0.03). Iron in
   immunopattern III lesions is 28\% lower than in the periplaque white
   matter (95\% CI = -40 to -14\%, p < 0.001). When normalizing the iron
   content of early active lesions to that of surrounding periplaque white
   matter, the ratio is significantly higher in immunopattern II (p <
   0.001). Microfocused X-ray fluorescence imaging shows that iron in
   immunopattern II lesions localizes to macrophages, whereas macrophages
   in immunopattern III lesions contain little iron.
   Interpretation Iron distribution and content are heterogeneous in early
   active MS lesions. Iron accumulates in macrophages in immunopattern II,
   but not immunopattern III lesions. This heterogeneity in the two most
   common MS immunopatterns may be explained by different macrophage
   polarization, origin, or different demyelination mechanisms, and paves
   the way for developing new or using existing iron-sensitive magnetic
   resonance imaging techniques to differentiate among immunopatterns in
   the general nonbiopsied MS patient population. ANN NEUROL 2020}},

Title = {{Trust in open data applications through transparency}},
Journal = {{NEW MEDIA \& SOCIETY}},
Abstract = {{Open data provide great potential for society, for example, in the field
   of smart cities, from which all citizens might profit. The trust of
   these citizens is important for the integration of various data, like
   sensitive user data, into an open data ecosystem. In the following
   study, we analyzed whether transparency about the application of open
   data promotes trust. Furthermore, we formulated guidelines on how to
   create transparency regarding open data in an ethical way. Using an
   open-data-based fictitious smart city app, we conducted an experiment
   analyzing to what extent communication of the technical open data
   application process and the ethical self-commitment for the transparent
   communication of data application affect trust in the app's provider.
   The results indicate that the more information users obtain regarding
   the use of open data, the more trustworthy they perceive the app
   provider to be, and the more likely they are to use the app.}},

Abstract = {{Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) DUXAP10 has been shown to act as an oncogene
   in various tumors; however, its roles in glioma progression have never
   been established. Here, we show that DUXAP10 is overexpressed in glioma
   tissues and cells. Loss of function experiments reveal that DUXAP10
   knockdown has little effects on glioma cell viability, but significantly
   reduces the stemness of glioma cells, which is characterized as the
   decrease of stemness marker expression, tumor sphere-forming ability,
   and ALDH activity. RNA immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays
   indicate that DUXAP10 can directly interact with HuR protein and
   suppress the cytoplasm-nuclear translocation of HuR, which subsequently
   enhances Sox12 mRNA stability in cytoplasm and thus increases Sox12
   expression. Further rescuing experiments show that the HuR/Sox12 axis is
   responsible for DUXAP10-mediated effects on glioma cell stemness.}},

Abstract = {{Background: High-salt intake after renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)
   injury leads to hypertension and further renal injury, but the
   mechanisms are largely unknown. This study tested the hypothesis that
   degeneration of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1
   (TRPV1)-positive nerves exacerbates salt-induced hypertension and renal
   injury after I/R via enhancing renal macrophage infiltration.Methods:
   large dose of capsaicin (CAP, 100 mg/kg, subcutaneously) was used to
   degenerate rat TRPV1-positive nerves. Then, rats were subjected to renal
   I/R injury and fed with a low-salt (0.4\% NaCl) diet for 5 weeks after
   I/R, followed by a high-salt (4\% NaCl) diet for 4 weeks during which
   macrophages were depleted using liposome-encapsulated clodronate (LC,
   1.3 ml/kg/week, intravenously).Results: The protein level of TRPV1 in
   the kidney was downregulated by renal I/R injury and was further
   decreased by CAP treatment. LC treatment did not affect the protein
   levels of renal TRPV1. After renal I/R injury, high-salt diet
   significantly increased renal macrophage infiltration, inflammatory
   cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin 1 beta), systolic
   blood pressure, the urine/water intake ratio, plasma creatine and urea
   levels, urinary 8-isoprostane, and renal collagen deposition.
   Interestingly, CAP treatment further increased these parameters. These
   increases were abolished by depleting macrophages with LC
   treatment.Conclusions: These data suggest that degenerating
   TRPV1-positive nerves exacerbates salt-induced hypertension and tissue
   injury in rats after renal I/R injury via macrophages-mediated renal
   inflammation.}},

Abstract = {{Background Focal epilepsy is the most common form of epilepsy in adults.
   Advances in brain imaging allowed better identification of different
   structural lesions underlying focal epilepsy. However, the response to
   antiepileptic drugs in lesional epilepsy is heterogeneous and difficult
   to anticipate. This study aimed to evaluate the response to
   antiepileptic drugs (AED) in patients with lesional epilepsy and to
   identify the predictors for poor seizure control. Methods One hundred
   and sixty-five patients with lesional epilepsy were included; the
   clinical diagnosis of epilepsy and seizure classification was based on
   the revised criteria of the International League Against Epilepsy
   (ILAE). Patients were subjected to full clinical assessment, MRI brain
   imaging epilepsy protocol, and EEG monitoring. All subjects were
   followed in the epilepsy clinic for at least 6 months. Results 75.8\% of
   patients with lesional epilepsy showed poor response to antiepileptic
   medications. Cerebromalatic lesions related to brain trauma was the most
   frequently encountered (21.8\%). Malformations of cortical development
   were significantly associated with poor response to AED (p = 0.040).
   Polytherapy and the combined use of 1st- and 2nd-generation AED were
   higher in the poor response group. Logistic regression analysis revealed
   that younger age at seizure onset and abnormal EEG findings was 0.965
   times and 2.5 times more associated with poor seizure control,
   respectively. Conclusion This study revealed that patients with lesional
   epilepsy who develop seizures in their early life, who suffer from
   malformations of cortical development, or who show abnormal EEG findings
   are more suspected to show poor response to AED.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Birth asphyxia (BA) is often associated with seizures that may
   exacerbate the ensuing hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. In rodent models
   of BA, exposure to hypoxia is used to evoke seizures, that commence
   already during the insult. This is in stark contrast to clinical BA, in
   which seizures are typically seen upon recovery. Here, we introduce a
   term-equivalent rat model of BA, in which seizures are triggered after
   exposure to asphyxia.
   Methods Postnatal day 11-12 male rat pups were exposed to steady
   asphyxia (15 min; air containing 5\% O-2 + 20\% CO2) or to intermittent
   asphyxia (30 min; three 5 + 5-min cycles of 9\% and 5\% O-2 at 20\%
   CO2). Cortical activity and electrographic seizures were recorded in
   freely behaving animals. Simultaneous electrode measurements of
   intracortical pH, Po-2, and local field potentials (LFPs) were made
   under urethane anesthesia.
   Results Both protocols decreased blood pH to <7.0 and brain pH from 7.3
   to 6.7 and led to a fall in base excess by 20 mmol center dot L-1.
   Electrographic seizures with convulsions spanning the entire Racine
   scale were triggered after intermittent but not steady asphyxia. In the
   presence of 20\% CO2, brain Po-2 was only transiently affected by 9\%
   ambient O-2 but fell below detection level during the steps to 5\% O-2,
   and LFP activity was nearly abolished. Post-asphyxia seizures were
   strongly suppressed when brain pH recovery was slowed down by 5\% CO2.
   Significance The rate of brain pH recovery has a strong influence on
   post-asphyxia seizure propensity. The recurring hypoxic episodes during
   intermittent asphyxia promote neuronal excitability, which leads to
   seizures only after the suppressing effect of the hypercapnic acidosis
   is relieved. The present rodent model of BA is to our best knowledge the
   first one in which, consistent with clinical BA, behavioral and
   electrographic seizures are triggered after and not during the
   BA-mimicking insult.}},

Abstract = {{In this manuscript, a hybrid approach for energy management in grid
   connected MG system is proposed. The grid connected MG system has
   photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine (WT), micro turbine (MT), battery. The
   proposed hybrid approach is the consolidation of both the Gradient
   Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) and Sandpiper Optimization Algorithm
   (SOA) and this way the proposed technique is named as GBDT-SOA. Here, at
   grid connected micro-grid configuration the required load demand is ever
   monitored by the GBDT approach. The perfect combination of the MG is
   optimized by SOA considering the predicted load requirement. The fuel
   cost including grid power hourly power variation, operation and
   maintenance cost of the grid connected micro-grid system is defined as
   the objective of the proposed technique. The constraints are power
   demand, renewable energy sources, state of charge of storage elements.
   Batteries have been used as an energy source, to stabilize and allow the
   renewable power system units to maintain running in a steady, stable
   output power. At that point, the proposed model is executed in
   MATLAB/Simulink work site and the performance is analyzed with existing
   techniques, such as BFO, SOA and SSA. The efficiency of the sources like
   photovoltaic, wind turbine, micro turbine, and battery using proposed
   technique is 95.9375\%, 92.113\%, 94.387\% and 93.7560\%.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundRoutine eye examination plays a vital role in detecting
   diabetic retinopathy in its earliest stage before the onset of
   blindness. Patients' knowledge about the nature and the consequences of
   diabetic retinopathy and routine eye checkup helps for timely
   identification and early treatment. However, there is limited evidence
   on knowledge of patients with diabetes mellitus on diabetic retinopathy
   and their eye check-up practices in Ethiopia.The aim of this study was
   to assess knowledge about diabetic retinopathy, eye check-up practice
   and associated factors of diabetic retinopathy among adult diabetic
   patients at Debark hospital, Northwest Ethiopia.MethodsInstitution based
   cross-sectional study was conducted at Debark hospital, Northwest
   Ethiopia, from April 20/2018- May 20/2018. A pretested interviewer
   administered structured questionnaire was used to collect data among 230
   diabetic patients aged 18years and above. Data were entered in to Epi
   Info version 7 and exported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Bivariable
   and multivariable binary logistic regression analyses were done. Odds
   ratio with 95\% confidence level was determined and variables with
   p-value of <0.05 were considered as statistically significant.ResultOut
   of 238 sample 230 were participated, among this, 119 (51.7\%) were
   males. The mean age of the respondents was 49 (SD 17.6) years. One
   hundred nine (47.4\%) participants had good knowledge and 91 (39.6\%)
   had good eye check-up practice. Urban residence {[}AOR=2.65;95\% CI:
   1.16-6.07)]), monthly income of 3501-8000 birr {[}AOR=4.54;(1.31-15.7)],
   type II diabetes mellitus {[}AOR=3.9;(1.6-9.6)], duration of diabetes
   (6-12years {[}AOR=4.4;(1.4-13.5)]), history of eye disease
   {[}AOR=5.5;(2.3-13.0)] were associated with good knowledge. Similarly,
   longer duration of diabetes (13-25years {[}AOR=3.77; (1.05-13.5)]) and
   history of eye disease {[}AOR=2.47; (1.09-5.62)] were associated with
   good eye check-up practice.Conclusion The proportion of good knowledge
   about diabetic retinopathy among diabetic patients at Debark hospital
   was fair (47.4\%) and good eye check-up practice (eye examination at
   least once in the past year) was low (39.6\%). Longer duration of
   diabetes and history of eye disease were identified as positive factors
   for good knowledge and eye check-up practice. Knowledge and regular eye
   check-up practice needs to be enhanced through provision of appropriate
   health education.}},

Abstract = {{Membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1- MMP, MMP-14), a
   transmembrane proteinase with a short cytoplasmic tail, is a major
   effector of extracellular matrix remodeling. Genetic silencing of
   MT1-MMP in mouse (Mmp14(-/-)) and man causes dwarfism, osteopenia,
   arthritis, and lipodystrophy, abnormalities ascribed to defective
   collagen turnover. We have previously shown non-proteolytic functions of
   MT1-MMP mediated by its cytoplasmic tail, where the unique tyrosine
   (Y573) controls intracellular signaling. The Y573D mutation blocks
   TIMP-2/MT1MMP-induced Erk1/2 and Akt signaling without affecting
   proteolytic activity. Here, we report that a mouse with the MT1-MMP
   Y573D mutation (Mmp14Y573D/Y573D) shows abnormalities similar to but
   also different from those of Mmp14(-/-) mice. Skeletal stem cells (SSC)
   of Mmp14Y573D/Y573D mice show defective differentiation consistent with
   the mouse phenotype, which is rescued by wild-type SSC transplant. These
   results provide the first in vivo demonstration that MT1-MMP modulates
   bone, cartilage, and fat homeostasis by controlling SSC differentiation
   through a mechanism independent of proteolysis.}},

Title = {{Medical Liability in Cancer Care During COVID-19 Pandemic: Heroes or
   Guilty?}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: The COVID-19 outbreak rapidly became a public health
   emergency affecting particularly the frail category as cancer patients.
   This led oncologists to radical changes in patient management, facing
   the unprecedent issue whether treatments in oncology could be postponed
   without compromising their efficacy.
   Purpose: To discuss legal implications in oncology practice during the
   COVID-19 pandemic.
   Perspective: Treatment delay is not always feasible in oncology where
   the timing often plays a key role and may impact significantly in
   prognosis. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the oncologists were found
   between the anvil and the hammer, on the one hand the need to treat
   cancer patients aiming to improve clinical benefits, and on the other
   hand the goal to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection avoiding or
   delaying immunosuppressive treatments and hospital exposure. Therefore,
   two rising scenarios with possible implications in both criminal and
   civil law are emerging. Firstly, oncologists may be ``accused{''} of
   having delayed or omitted the diagnosis and/or treatments with
   consequent worsening of patients' outcome. Secondly, oncologists can be
   blamed for having exposed patients to hospital environment considered at
   risk for COVID-19 transmission.
   Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, clinical decision making
   should be well-balanced through a careful examination between clinical
   performance status, age, comorbidities, aim of the treatment, and the
   potential risk of COVID-19 infection in order to avoid the risk of
   suboptimal cancer care with potential legal repercussion. Moreover, all
   cases should be discussed in the oncology team or in the tumor board in
   order to share the best strategy to adopt case by case.}},

Abstract = {{The low-temperature water-gas shift reaction (WGSR, CO+H2O H-2+CO2) is
   considered a very promising reaction -candidate for fuel cells- despite
   an efficient and robust catalyst is still desirable. One of the more
   prominent catalysts for this reaction is based on single Pt atoms (Pt-1)
   on different supports, which are supposed to manifold the reaction by
   the accepted mechanism for the general WGSR, i. e. by addition of one
   H2O molecule to CO, with generation of CO2 and H-2. Here we show,
   experimentally, that not one but two H2O molecules are added to CO on
   the Pt-1 catalyst, as assessed by a combination of reactivity
   experiments with soluble Pt catalysts, kinetic and spectroscopic
   measurements, and finally by in-operando single crystal X-ray
   diffraction on a Pt-1-MOF, to visualize the formation of the hemiacetal
   intermediate on the solid catalytic site. These results confirm our
   previous DFT predictions and provide a paradigmatic shift in the assumed
   mechanism of the WGSR, which may open the debate if two H2O molecules
   are recurrently added during the WGSR, not only for Pt-1 catalysts but
   also for other metal catalysts.}},

Abstract = {{The 2014-16 Ebola crisis in West Africa was China's very first
   opportunity to demonstrate its willingness and ability to play a
   meaningful role in addressing public health emergencies of international
   concern. China's decision to participate in the international response
   to the outbreak was part of an ambition to enhance its contribution to
   Africa's security in general and health security in particular and to
   exert more influence on global norms. The specific role played by the
   People's Liberation Army (PLA), especially its Academy of Military
   Medical Sciences, in Sierra Leone and Liberia is part of an ongoing
   effort to increase China's involvement in international humanitarian
   assistance and disaster relief operations. It was the first time that it
   sent medical military teams to set up and operate infectious disease
   hospitals overseas. This participation also underscores the PLA's
   crucial role in fighting epidemics overseas as well as at home, as the
   current COVID-19 pandemic illustrates. The Ebola crisis enables us to
   explore aspects of the PLA's overseas missions, some of which are
   humanitarian and others which generally enhance China's influence as a
   great power in Africa and in the world in the context of a growing
   Sino-US strategic competition.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundBactrocera dorsalis is a destructive polyphagous and highly
   invasive insect pest of tropical and subtropical species of fruit and
   vegetable crops. The sterile insect technique (SIT) has been used for
   decades to control insect pests of agricultural, veterinary, and human
   health importance. Irradiation of pupae in SIT can reduce the ecological
   fitness of the sterile insects. Our previous study has shown that a gut
   bacterial strain BD177 that could restore ecological fitness by
   promoting host food intake and metabolic activities.ResultsUsing
   long-read sequence technologies, we assembled the complete genome of K.
   michiganensis BD177 strain. The complete genome of K. michiganensis
   BD177 comprises one circular chromosome and four plasmids with a GC
   content of 55.03\%. The pan-genome analysis was performed on 119 genomes
   (strain BD177 genome and 118 out of 128 published Klebsiella sp. genomes
   since ten were discarded). The pan-genome includes a total of 49305 gene
   clusters, a small number of 858 core genes, and a high number of
   accessory (10566) genes. Pan-genome and average nucleotide identity
   (ANI) analysis showed that BD177 is more similar to the type strain K.
   michiganensis DSM2544, while away from the type strain K. oxytoca
   ATCC13182. Comparative genome analysis with 21K. oxytoca and 12K.
   michiganensis strains, identified 213 unique genes, several of them
   related to amino acid metabolism, metabolism of cofactors and vitamins,
   and xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism in BD177
   genome.ConclusionsPhylogenomics analysis reclassified strain BD177 as a
   member of the species K. michiganensis. Comparative genome analysis
   suggested that K. michiganensis BD177 has the strain-specific ability to
   provide three essential amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan and
   methionine) and two vitamins B (folate and riboflavin) to B. dorsalis.
   The clear classification status of BD177 strain and identification of
   unique genetic characteristics may contribute to expanding our
   understanding of the symbiotic relationship of gut microbiota and B.
   dorsalis.}},

Abstract = {{Dense surface glycosylation on the HIV-1 envelope (Env) protein acts as
   a shield from the adaptive immune system. However, the molecular
   complexity and flexibility of glycans make experimental studies a
   challenge. Here we have integrated high-throughput atomistic modeling of
   fully glycosylated HIV-1 Env with graph theory to capture
   immunologically important features of the shield topology. This is the
   first complete all-atom model of HIV-1 Env SOSIP glycan shield that
   includes both oligomannose and complex glycans, providing
   physiologically relevant insights of the glycan shield. This integrated
   approach including quantitative comparison with cryo-electronmicroscopy
   data provides hitherto unexplored details of the native shield
   architecture and its difference from the high-mannose glycoform. We have
   also derived a measure to quantify the shielding effect over the
   antigenic protein surface that defines regions of relative vulnerability
   and resilience of the shield and can be harnessed for rational immunogen
   design.}},

Title = {{Prefrontal Asymmetry BCI Neurofeedback Datasets}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{Prefrontal cortex (PFC) asymmetry is an important marker in affective
   neuroscience and has attracted significant interest, having been
   associated with studies of motivation, eating behavior, empathy, risk
   propensity, and clinical depression. The data presented in this paper
   are the result of three different experiments using PFC asymmetry
   neurofeedback (NF) as a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) paradigm, rather
   than a therapeutic mechanism aiming at long-term effects, using
   functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) which is known to be
   particularly well-suited to the study of PFC asymmetry and is less
   sensitive to artifacts. From an experimental perspective the BCI context
   brings more emphasis on individual subjects' baselines, successful and
   sustained activation during epochs, and minimal training. The subject
   pool is also drawn from the general population, with less bias toward
   specific behavioral patterns, and no inclusion of any patient data. We
   accompany our datasets with a detailed description of data formats,
   experiment and protocol designs, as well as analysis of the
   individualized metrics for definitions of success scores based on
   baseline thresholds as well as reference tasks. The work presented in
   this paper is the result of several experiments in the domain of BCI
   where participants are interacting with continuous visual feedback
   following a real-time NF paradigm, arising from our long-standing
   research in the field of affective computing. We offer the community
   access to our fNIRS datasets from these experiments. We specifically
   provide data drawn from our empirical studies in the field of affective
   interactions with computer-generated narratives as well as interfacing
   with algorithms, such as heuristic search, which all provide a mechanism
   to improve the ability of the participants to engage in active BCI due
   to their realistic visual feedback. Beyond providing details of the
   methodologies used where participants received real-time NF of
   left-asymmetric increase in activation in their dorsolateral prefrontal
   cortex (DLPFC), we re-establish the need for carefully designing
   protocols to ensure the benefits of NF paradigm in BCI are enhanced by
   the ability of the real-time visual feedback to adapt to the individual
   responses of the participants. Individualized feedback is paramount to
   the success of NF in BCIs.}},

Abstract = {{This retrospective nested case-control study is aimed at investigating
   the relationship between HbAlc and perioperative cardiovascular events
   (PCE) in patients with diabetes who underwent complex or moderately

   groups according to HbA1c <= 7\%, 7.1\%-7.9\%, 8.0\%-8.9\%, and >= 9\%.
   The occurrence of PCE among the groups was compared using univariable
   and multivariable analyses. Finally, 318 patients were included. There
   were 90 cases of PCE among the 318 patients; the occurrence rate of PCE
   was 28.3\%. No death occurred. The occurrence rates of PCE in the HbA1c
   >= 8.0\%-8.9\% and HbA1c >= 9.0\% groups were 30.8\% and 35.4\%,
   respectively (P<0.001 vs. the HbA1c 7.1\%-7.9\% group). The occurrence
   rate of PCE in the HbA1c <= 7\% group was 25.9\% (P>0.05 vs. the HbA1c
   7.1\%-7.9\% group). The multivariable logistic regression analysis
   showed that the course of diabetes (HbA1c stratification <= 7\%,
   7.1\%-7.9\%, 8.0\%-8.9\%, >= 9\%, OR=3.672, 95\% CI: 1.552-8.687), HbA1c

   and microalbuminuria (OR=1.098, 95\% CI: 1.005-1.023) was independently
   associated with PCE in diabetic patients. In conclusion, HbA1c levels
   are related to the incidence of PCE in diabetic patients undergoing

Abstract = {{BackgroundPest eradication using the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT)
   involves high-density releases of sterilized males that mate with wild
   females and ultimately suppress the population. Sterilized females are
   not required for SIT and their removal or separation from males prior to
   release remains challenging. In order to develop genetic sexing strains
   (GSS), conditional traits such as temperature sensitive lethality are
   required.ResultsHere we introduce a known Drosophila melanogaster
   temperature sensitive embryonic lethal mutation into Bactrocera tryoni,
   a serious horticultural pest in Australia. A non-synonymous point
   mutation in the D. melanogaster gene shibire causes embryonic lethality
   at 29 degrees C and we successfully used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to
   recreate the orthologous shibire temperature sensitive-1 (shi(ts1))
   mutation in B. tryoni. Genotypic analyses over three generations
   revealed that a high fitness cost was associated with the shi(ts1)
   mutant allele and shi(ts1) homozygotes were not viable at 21 degrees C,
   which is a more severe phenotype than that documented in D.
   melanogaster.ConclusionsWe have demonstrated the first successful use of
   CRISPR/Cas9 to introduce precise single base substitutions in an
   endogenous gene via homology-directed repair in an agricultural pest
   insect and this technology can be used to trial other conditional
   mutations for the ultimate aim of generating genetic sexing strains for

Abstract = {{Objective The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the novel use of an
   empirically supported treatment for sleep problems for people with
   residual insomnia disorder following ED treatment.
   Method Participants (N = 6) will complete a single-case multiple
   baseline study using Brief Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia (Buysse et
   al., Archives of Internal Medicine, 171, 2011, 887-895; Troxel et al.,
   Behavioral Sleep Medicine, 10, 2012, 266-279). Participants will
   complete pre- and post-treatment evaluations of insomnia severity, sleep
   efficiency, daytime fatigue, ED symptoms, depressive symptoms, and
   anxiety symptoms. Throughout treatment, participants will complete daily
   diaries of sleep indices (sleep latency, wake after sleep onset, total
   sleep time, and sleep efficiency).
   Results The primary outcome will be treatment effects on insomnia
   severity, measured by the Insomnia Severity Index. Secondary outcomes
   include sleep efficiency and daytime fatigue. Exploratory outcomes
   include ED-related impairment and symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and
   depression symptoms. We will provide subject-level graphs of sleep
   indices and ED symptoms throughout treatment. Additionally, treatment
   effects will be examined at one- and three-month follow-up.
   Discussion Although insomnia treatments have been evaluated in other
   psychiatric disorders, there has yet to be a study examining behavioral
   interventions for insomnia in EDs. Results of this study will inform the
   development and application of interventions for residual insomnia
   symptoms in this population.}},

Volume = {{125}},
Number = {{25}},
Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{Spontaneous contractions of cardiomyocytes are driven by calcium
   oscillations due to the activity of ionic calcium channels and pumps.
   The beating phase is related to the time-dependent deviation of the
   oscillations from their average frequency, due to noise and the
   resulting cellular response. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that,
   in addition to the short-time (1-2 Hz), beat-to-beat variability, there
   are long-time correlations (tens of minutes) in the beating phase
   dynamics of isolated cardiomyocytes. Our theoretical model relates these
   long-time correlations to cellular regulation that restores the
   frequency to its average, homeostatic value in response to stochastic
   perturbations.}},

Title = {{A pilot study of stereotactic boost for malignant epidural spinal cord
   compression: clinical significance and initial dosimetric evaluation}},
Journal = {{RADIATION ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Metastatic epidural spinal cord compression (MESCC) is a
   devastating complication of advanced malignancy, which can result in
   neurologic complications and significant deterioration in overall
   function and quality of life. Most patients are not candidates for
   optimal surgical decompression and as a result, receive urgent 3D
   conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) to prevent or attempt to reverse
   neurologic progression. Multiple trials indicate that response and
   ambulatory rates after 3DCRT are inferior to surgery. The advent of
   stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has created a method with
   which a ``radiosurgical decompression{''} boost may facilitate improve
   outcomes for MESCC patients.
   Methods: We are conducting a pilot study to investigate SBRT boost after
   urgent 3D CRT for patients with MESCC. The aim of the study is to
   establish feasibility of this two-phase treatment regimen, and
   secondarily to characterize post-treatment ambulation status, motor
   response, pain control, quality of life and survival.
   Discussion: We describe the study protocol and present a case report of
   one patient. A quality assurance review was conducted after the first
   seven patients, and resultant dose-constraints were revised to improve
   safety and feasibility of planning through more conservative organ at
   risk constraints. There have been no severe adverse events (grade 3-5)
   to date. We have illustrated clinical and dosimetric data of an example
   case, where a patient regained full strength and ambulatory capacity.
   Conclusions: Our study aims to determine if SBRT is a feasible option in
   addition to standard 3DCRT for MESCC patients, with the goal to consider
   future randomized trials if successful. Having a robust quality
   assurance process in this study ensures translatability going forward if
   future trials with multicenter and increased patient representation are
   to be considered.}},

Abstract = {{Chemoenzymatic strategies are useful for providing both regio- and
   stereoselective access to bioactive oligosaccharides. We show herein
   that a glycosynthase mutant of a Thermus thermophilus alpha-glycosidase
   can react with unnatural glycosides such as
   6-azido-6-deoxy-D-glucose/glucosamine to lead to
   beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1 -> 3)-D-glucopyranoside or
   beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1 -> 3)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranoside
   derivatives bearing a unique azide function. Taking advantage of the
   orthogonality between the azide and the hydroxyl functional groups, the
   former was next selectively reacted to give rise to a library of
   galectin-3 inhibitors. Combining enzyme substrate promiscuity and
   bioorthogonality thus appears as a powerful strategy to rapidly access
   to sugar-based ligands.}},

Title = {{Wheel-rail contact simulation with lookup tables and KEC profiles: a
   comparative study}},
Journal = {{MULTIBODY SYSTEM DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{339-375}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes and compares the use and limitations of two
   constraint-based formulations for the wheel-rail contact simulation in
   multibody dynamics: (1) the use of contact lookup tables and (2) the
   Knife-edge Equivalent Contact constraint method (KEC-method). Both
   formulations are presented and an accurate procedure to interpolate
   within the data in the lookup table is also described. Since the
   wheel-rail constraint contact approach finds difficulties at
   simultaneous tread and flange contact scenarios, the lookup table method
   is implemented with a penetration-based elastic contact model for the
   flange, turning the method into a hybrid (constant in the tread and
   elastic in the flange) approach. To deal with the two-point contact
   scenario in the KEC-method, a regularisation of the tread-flange
   transition allows the use of the constraint approach in the tread and
   also in the flange. To show the applicability and limitations of both
   methods, they are studied and compared with special emphasis in the
   calculation of normal and tangential contact forces. Numerical results
   are based on the simulation of a two-wheeled bogie vehicle in different
   case studies that consider irregular tracks and two wheel-rail profiles
   combinations: profiles that do not show two-point wheel-rail contacts
   and profiles that do show two-point wheel-rail contacts. Although
   results show a good agreement between both approaches, the use of the
   KEC-method is more extensive since it allows to reproduce the
   wheel-climbing scenario that cannot be simulated with the lookup table
   method with the hybrid contact approach. It is concluded that
   simulations with this later method may not be on the safe side.}},

Abstract = {{The emergence of COVID-19 has led to a pandemic that has caused millions

   that neutralized the virus in vitro. Administration of the lead antibody
   clone to Syrian hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2 significantly
   reduced viral load and histopathology score in the lungs. Moreover, the
   antibody interrupted monocyte infiltration into the lungs, which may
   have contributed to the reduction of disease severity by limiting
   immunopathological exacerbation. The use of this antibody could provide
   an important therapy for treatment of COVID-19 patients.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the seventh most common malignancy and
   the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths. Autophagy plays a
   crucial role in the development and progression of HCC.
   Methods
   Univariate and Lasso Cox regression analyses were performed to determine
   a gene model that was optimal for overall survival (OS) prediction.
   Patients in the GSE14520 and GSE54236 datasets of the Cancer Genome
   Atlas (TCGA) were divided into the high-risk and low-risk groups
   according to established ATG models. Univariate and multivariate Cox
   regression analyses were used to identify risk factors for OS for the
   purpose of constructing nomograms. Calibration and receiver operating
   characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate model performance.
   Real-time PCR was used to validate the effects of the presence or
   absence of an autophagy inhibitor on gene expression in HepG2 and Huh7
   cell lines.
   Results
   OS in the high-risk group was significantly shorter than that in the
   low-risk group. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) indicated that the
   association between the low-risk group and autophagy- as well as
   immune-related pathways was significant. ULK2, PPP3CC, and NAFTC1 may
   play vital roles in preventing HCC progression. Furthermore, tumor
   environment analysis via ESTIMATION indicated that the low-risk group
   was associated with high immune and stromal scores. Based on EPIC
   prediction, CD8+ T and B cell fractions in the TCGA and GSE54236
   datasets were significantly higher in the low-risk group than those in
   the high-risk group. Finally, based on the results of univariate and
   multivariate analyses three variables were selected for nomogram
   development. The calibration plots showed good agreement between
   nomogram prediction and actual observations. Inhibition of autophagy
   resulted in the overexpression of genes constituting the gene model in
   HepG2 and Huh7 cells.
   Conclusions
   The current study determined the role played by autophagy-related genes
   (ATGs) in the progression of HCC and constructed a novel nomogram that
   predicts OS in HCC patients, through a combined analysis of TCGA and
   gene expression omnibus (GEO) databases.}},

   H-1 NMR measurements of such double isotope-labeled compounds can
   provide a great deal of information on the dihedral angles across

Title = {{Signal Recognition Particle RNA Contributes to Oxidative Stress Response
   in Deinococcus radiodurans by Modulating Catalase Localization}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{The proper functioning of many proteins requires their transport to the
   correct cellular compartment or their secretion. Signal recognition
   particle (SRP) is a major protein transport pathway responsible for the
   co-translational movement of integral membrane proteins as well as
   periplasmic proteins. Deinococcus radiodurans is a ubiquitous bacterium
   that expresses a complex phenotype of extreme oxidative stress
   resistance, which depends on proteins involved in DNA repair,
   metabolism, gene regulation, and antioxidant defense. These proteins are
   located extracellularly or subcellularly, but the molecular mechanism of
   protein localization in D. radiodurans to manage oxidative stress
   response remains unexplored. In this study, we characterized the SRP
   complex in D. radiodurans R1 and showed that the knockdown (KD) of the
   SRP RNA (Qpr6) reduced bacterial survival under hydrogen peroxide and
   growth under chronic ionizing radiation. Through LC-mass spectrometry
   (MS/MS) analysis, we detected 162 proteins in the periplasm of wild-type
   D. radiodurans, of which the transport of 65 of these proteins to the
   periplasm was significantly reduced in the Qpr6 KD strain. Through
   Western blotting, we further demonstrated the localization of the
   catalases in D. radiodurans, DR\_1998 (KatE1) and DR\_A0259 (KatE2), in
   both the cytoplasm and periplasm, respectively, and showed that the
   accumulation of KatE1 and KatE2 in the periplasm was reduced in the
   SRP-defective strains. Collectively, this study establishes the
   importance of the SRP pathway in the survival and the transport of
   antioxidant proteins in D. radiodurans under oxidative stress.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR NUTRITION \& FOOD RESEARCH}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Scope Garlic (Allium sativum) has been used for centuries as a
   prophylactic and therapeutic medicinal agent to control
   inflammation-associated pathologies. To investigate the underlying
   mechanisms, an in vitro inflammatory model is established using RAW264.7
   murine macrophages exposed to low-doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in
   the presence of garlic compounds allicin and Z-ajoene (ZA), mimicking
   regular garlic consumption.
   Methods and Results Both allicin and Z-ajoene dampen both transcript and
   protein expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL1 beta, IL6, and
   IL12 beta, and upregulate the expression of the anti-inflammatory
   cytokine IL10. Protein arrays of selected secreted inflammatory
   mediators confirm that Z-ajoene has a pronounced down-regulatory effect
   on LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Many of these
   proteins are known targets of the transcription factor signal transducer
   and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3); and indeed, Z-ajoene or its
   analogue dansyl-ajoene is found to decrease phosphorylation and nuclear
   translocation of STAT3, and to covalently modify the protein by
   S-thiolation at Cys108, Cys367, and Cys687. Z-Ajoene dose-dependently
   and non-competitively inhibit the activity of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2),
   possibly attributed to S-thiolation at Cys9 and Cys299.
   Conclusion The characterization of Z-ajoene's activity of targeting and
   covalently modifying STAT3 and COX2, both important regulators of
   inflammation, may contribute to the health benefits of regular dietary
   garlic consumption.}},

Abstract = {{Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is less prevalent among men than
   women, but more men than women initiate kidney replacement therapy.
   Differences in CKD awareness may contribute to this gender gap, which
   may further vary by race/ethnicity. We aimed to investigate trends in
   CKD awareness and the association between individual characteristics and
   CKD awareness among US men versus women.
   Methods and findings We conducted a serial, cross-sectional analysis of
   10 cycles (1999-2018) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
   Survey (NHANES). Adult participants with CKD stages G3-G5 (estimated
   glomerular filtration rate {[}eGFR] <60 mL/min/1.73m(2)) were included,
   unless they were on dialysis or medical information was missing. Serum
   creatinine was measured during NHANES medical exams. CKD stage was
   classified by eGFR, based on the CKD-EPI formula. CKD awareness was
   assessed with the question: ``Have you ever been told by a health care
   professional you had weak or failing kidneys{''}, asked in standardized
   NHANES questionnaires on each survey. Using logistic regression models,
   we evaluated the association between sex and CKD awareness, adjusting
   for potential confounders including age, race/ethnicity and
   comorbidities. We stratified CKD awareness by 5 pre-defined
   calendar-year periods and conducted all analyses for the complete study
   population as well as the Caucasian and African American subpopulations.
   We found that among 101871 US persons participating in NHANES, 4411
   (2232 women) had CKD in stages G3-G5. These participants were, on
   average, 7310 years old, 25.3\% reported diabetes, 78.0\% reported
   hypertension or had elevated blood pressure during medical examinations
   and 39.8\% were obese (percentages were survey-weighted). CKD awareness
   was more prevalent among those with higher CKD stage, younger age,
   diabetes, hypertension and higher body mass index. CKD awareness was
   generally low (<22.5\%), though it increased throughout the study
   period, remaining consistently higher among men compared to women, with
   a decreasing gender gap over time (adjusted odds ratio {[}men-to-women]
   for CKD awareness = 2.71 {[}1.31-5.64] in period 1; = 1.32 {[}0.82-2.12]
   in period 5). The sex difference in CKD awareness was smaller in African
   American participants, in whom CKD awareness was generally higher. Using
   serum creatinine rather than eGFR as the CKD-defining exposure, CKD
   awareness increased with rising serum creatinine, in a close to
   identical fashion among both sexes during 1999-2008, while during
   2009-2018, CKD awareness among women increased earlier than among men
   (i.e. with lower serum creatinine levels).
   Conclusions CKD awareness is lower among US women than men. The
   narrowing gap between the sexes in more recent years and the results on
   CKD awareness by serum creatinine indicate that health care
   professionals have previously been relying on serum creatinine to inform
   patients about their condition, but in more recent years have been using
   eGFR, which accounts for women's lower serum creatinine levels due to
   their lower muscle mass. Additional efforts should be made to increase
   CKD awareness among both sexes.}},

Abstract = {{Blood vessels perform critical functions in both health and disease.
   Understanding how vessels form, pattern and respond to damage is
   essential. However, labeling and imaging the vasculature to ascertain
   these properties can be difficult and time-consuming. Here, the authors
   present a novel methodology for rapidly and efficiently labeling whole
   vascular networks in vivo by exploiting the fluorescent properties of
   Evans blue. By combining the labeling with fluorescence microscopy, this
   method enables visualization of whole tissue vasculature for a fraction
   of the time and cost compared with traditional methods.
   METHOD SUMMARY
   Evans blue is injected into the circulatory system of the experimental
   model. Following euthanasia, the tissue is collected, fixed and
   subsequently cleared (if necessary). Various fluorescent imaging
   modalities can be utilized to visualize the labeled vasculature.}},

Abstract = {{Facial pigmentation is an important economic trait of chickens,
   especially for laying hens, which will affect the carcass appearance of
   eliminated layers. Therefore, identifying the genomic regions and
   exploring the function of this region that contributes to understanding
   the variation of skin color traits is significant for breeding. In the
   study, 291 pure-line Xinyang blue-shelled laying hens were selected, of
   which 75 were dark-faced chickens and 216 were white-faced chickens. The
   population was sequenced and typed by GBS genotyping technology. The
   obtained high-quality SNPs and pigmentation phenotypes were analyzed by
   a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a FST scan. Based on the two
   analytical methods, we identified a same genomic region (10.70-11.60 Mb)
   on chromosome 20 with 68 significant SNPs (- log 10(P)>6), mapped to 10
   known genes, including NPEPL1, EDN3, GNAS, C20orf85, VAPB, BMP7, TUBB1,

Title = {{Intra-vitam Diagnosis of Tuberculosis in Pigs: Concordance Between
   Interferon-Gamma Release Assay and Comparative Tuberculin Skin Test}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{The role of pigs in the maintenance of bovine tuberculosis caused by
   Mycobacterium bovis has been demonstrated in many settings; however, the
   current control programs usually do not state any intra-vitam diagnostic
   procedure in this species, as for the cattle. Carcass inspection has
   shown to be insufficient to detect infection in swine; thus, the
   assessment of intradermal tuberculin test and interferon-gamma release
   assay (IGRA) in this species is mandatory. The current study compares
   the performances of the single intradermal comparative cervical
   tuberculin (SICCT) test and IGRA. A total of 628 Nebrodi Black pigs
   raised in free-roaming farms were subjected to the two tests
   simultaneously. Besides, 124 animals underwent postmortem examination
   for the detection of tuberculous lesions and isolation of mycobacteria
   from target organs. The two tests showed a concordance of 94.42\% with a
   Cohen's k coefficient of 0.786 and McNemar chi-square of 4.83 (P =
   0.03). Slightly lower levels of concordance (90.32\%) between SICCT and
   IGRA were obtained in the group of 124 animals, with a Cohen's k = 0.797
   and McNemar chi-squared value of 0.69 with a non-significant P = 0.41.
   Moreover, the results showed how IGRA tends to result positive in higher
   rates, mostly when non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) were isolated,
   suggesting a possible impairment of specificity in the event of
   coinfections in the swine. In conclusion, the results obtained support
   the possibility of the strategic use of IGRA or SICCT in combination or
   alternatively one to the other, particularly IGRA which showed lower
   specificity but has evident advantages over SICCT.}},

Abstract = {{Background Personalized risk stratification after acute coronary
   syndrome (ACS) remains a challenging field in the aging society. Easily
   applicable strategies for risk prediction of adverse events from an
   age-specific perspective are needed. Considering the association of
   cellular immunity with coronary vessel disease, these cell lines mirror
   a reasonable value for risk assessment. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate
   the prognostic value of cellular immunity on long-term outcome after ACS
   from an age-specific perspective.
   Methods Patients presenting with ACS at the Vienna General Hospital
   admitted between December 1996 and January 2010 were enrolled within a
   clinical registry including standardized assessment of peripheral blood
   samples and immune phenotyping. Cox-regression hazards analysis was
   performed to elucidate the impact of cellular immunity on survival.
   Results A total of 832 patients were included within the final analysis
   and stratified according to age into individuals <65 years ( n =416) and
   <greater than or equal to>65 years ( n =416). After a median follow-up
   time of 8.6 years, a total of 516 (62.0\%) individuals died. We found
   that the fraction of lymphocytes (adjusted hazard ratio {[}HR] of 0.61
   {[}95\% confidence interval, CI: 0.45-0.82]; p =0.001), the fraction of
   neutrophil granulocytes (adjusted HR of 5.01 {[}95\% CI: 1.62-15.46]; p
   =0.005), and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR; adjusted HR of
   1.47 {[}95\% CI: 1.16-1.87]; p =0.002) showed a strong and independent
   association with mortality in individuals >= 65 years. Notably, there
   was no effect on outcome observed for any of the tested cell lines in
   patients <65 years.
   Conclusion The present investigation highlighted a strong and
   independent age-specific effect of both the fraction of neutrophil
   granulocytes and lymphocytes as well as the NLR on outcome. Considering
   an age-dependent risk stratification, these routinely available values
   can be easily used to identify patients at risk for fatal events and
   contribute to proper secondary prevention after ACS.}},

Title = {{Effect of Durotomy versus Myelotomy on Tissue Sparing and Functional

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{746-755}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Various surgical strategies have been developed to alleviate elevated
   intraspinal pressure (ISP) following acute traumatic spinal cord injury
   (tSCI). Surgical decompression of either the dural (durotomy) or the
   dural and pial (myelotomy) lining of the spinal cord has been proposed.
   However, a direct comparison of these two strategies is lacking. Here,
   we compare the histological and functional effects of durotomy alone and
   durotomy plus myelotomy in a rodent model of acute thoracic tSCI. Our
   results indicate that tSCI causes local tissue edema and significantly
   elevates ISP (7.4 +/- 0.3 mmHg) compared with physiological ISP (1.7 +/-
   0.4 mmHg; p < 0.001). Both durotomy alone and durotomy plus myelotomy
   effectively mitigate elevated local ISP (p < 0.001). Histological
   examination at 10 weeks after tSCI revealed that durotomy plus myelotomy
   promoted spinal tissue sparing by 13.7\% compared with durotomy alone,
   and by 25.9\% compared with tSCI-only (p < 0.0001). Both types of
   decompression surgeries elicited a significant beneficial impact on gray
   matter sparing (p < 0.01). Impressively, durotomy plus myelotomy surgery
   increased preservation of motor neurons by 174.3\% compared with
   tSCI-only (p < 0.05). Durotomy plus myelotomy surgery also significantly
   promoted recovery of hindlimb locomotor function in an open-field test
   (p < 0.001). Interestingly, only durotomy alone resulted in favorable
   recovery of bladder and Ladder Walk performance. Combined, our data
   suggest that durotomy plus myelotomy following acute tSCI facilitates
   tissue sparing and recovery of locomotor function. In the future,
   biomarkers identifying spinal cord injuries that can benefit from either
   durotomy alone or durotomy plus myelotomy need to be developed.}},

Title = {{Are there birth cohort effects in disparities in child obesity by

Abstract = {{Background Children belonging to the same birth cohort (i.e., born in
   the same year) experience shared exposure to a common obesity-related
   milieu during the critical early years of development-e.g., secular
   beliefs and feeding practices, adverse chemical exposures, food access
   and nutrition assistance policies-that set the stage for a shared
   trajectory of obesity as they mature. Fundamental cause theory suggests
   that inequitable distribution of recent efforts to stem the rise in
   child obesity may exacerbate cohort-based disparities over time. Methods
   Data were from electronic health records spanning 2007-2016 linked to
   birth records for children ages 2-19 years. We used hierarchical
   age-period-cohort models to investigate cohort effects on disparities in
   obesity related to maternal education. We hypothesized that maternal
   education-based disparities in prevalence of obesity would be larger
   among more recent birth cohorts. Results Sex-stratified models adjusted
   for race/ethnicity showed substantial obesity disparities by maternal
   education that were evident even at young ages: prevalence among
   children with maternal education < high school compared to maternal
   college degree was approximately three times as high among girls and
   twice as high among boys. For maternal education < high school,
   disparities compared to maternal college degree were higher in more
   recent birth cohorts. Among girls, this disparity cohort effect was
   evident at younger ages (at age 4, the disparity increased by 4
   {[}0.1-8] percentage points per 5 birth years), while among boys it was
   larger at older ages (at age 16, the disparity increased by 7 {[}1-14]
   percentage points per 5 birth years). Conclusions There may be widening
   maternal education-based disparities in child obesity by birth cohort at
   some ages.}},

Abstract = {{Mini implants are increasingly used in foot and ankle surgery. They
   preserve the joints' functions, are easy to insert and easy to convert
   to an alternative treatment. Early surgical attempts using silastic
   implants did not bring the expected success. First achievements where
   reached with modern metallic mini implants in the first
   metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint and the ankle joint. For a few years
   now, a polyvinyl alcohol implant has been used to treat the arthritic
   first MTP joint. Even severe arthritic joints can be treated with an
   implant made of polylactide. This implant can also be used in the
   treatment of Lisfranc joint pathologies. To address severe osteochondral
   defects of the talus, an innovative hemiarthroplasty implant has been
   suggested. This article gives a summary of currently used mini implants.
   Their application as possible alternatives to total joint replacement or
   joint fusion are critically reviewed in the light of the current
   literature.}},

Abstract = {{A method to distinguish cloud thermodynamic phase from polarized Micro

Abstract = {{Guaiacol, one of the main components and a model compound of
   lignin-derived bio-oil, was transformed into phenol and methylated
   phenols over a series of supported iron catalysts under atmospheric
   pressure. CeO2 support was superior to other conventional supports in
   view of the activity of supported iron catalysts. The effect of iron
   loading amount on CeO2 supports showed a linear relationship with an
   iron loading amount up to 3 wt \%, which corresponded to ``monolayer{''}
   coverage, and then it was almost constant with a further increase of the
   iron content. The Fe/CeO2 catalyst with 3 wt \% iron loading
   (Fe(3)/CeO2) had higher stability than the catalysts with higher iron
   loadings. The optimal Fe(3)/CeO2 catalyst showed a 56\% phenol yield and
   an 87\% sum yield of phenol and methylated phenols at 673 K under
   guaiacol/N-2/H-2 = 1/45/135 flow with W/F = 1.0 g.h.mol(total)(-1). The
   X-ray diffraction (XRD), diffuse reflectance UV-visible (DRUV-vis),
   Raman, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) characterizations
   confirmed that the FeOx species were finely dispersed on the Fe/CeO2
   catalyst with <= 3 wt \% iron, and higher iron loadings led to formation
   of Fe2O3 particles in calcined catalysts. Although other supported iron
   catalysts with 3 wt \% iron loading also contained dispersed FeOx
   species, the reducibility of Fe/CeO2 was higher than that of other
   supported iron catalysts, which might be related to the higher activity.
   The XAS characterization of spent catalysts showed that the stable
   Fe(3)/CeO2 catalyst contained only Fe3+ and Fe2+ species during the
   reaction, while in the Fe(10)/CeO2 catalyst, the reduction of iron
   proceeded to a greater extent and Fe3C crystals grew during the
   reaction. The structure of this monolayer Fe(3)/CeO2 was further
   characterized by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and
   density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Rather than a
   two-dimensional Fe oxide sheet, a structure composed of dispersed Fe4O6
   clusters is suggested for monolayer coverage. The coordinatively
   unsaturated site (CUS) in the interface between FeOx and reducible CeO2
   is suggested to be the active site.}},

Abstract = {{Despite frequent foehns in the Beijing-TianjinHebei (BTH) region, there
   are only a few studies of their effects on air pollution in this region,
   or elsewhere. Here, we discuss a foehn-induced haze front (HF) event
   using observational data to document its structure and evolution. Using
   a dense network of comprehensive measurements in the BTH region, our
   analyses indicate that the foehn played an important role in the
   formation of the HF with significant impacts on air pollution. Northerly
   warm-dry foehn winds, with low particulate concentration in the northern
   area, collided with a cold-wet polluted air mass to the south and formed
   an HF in the urban area. The HF, which is associated with a surface wind
   convergence line and distinct contrasts of temperature, humidity and
   pollutant concentrations, resulted in an explosive growth of particulate
   concentration. As the plain-mountain wind circulation was overpowered by
   the foehn, a weak pressure gradient due to the different air densities
   between air masses was the main factor forcing advances of the polluted
   air mass into the clean air mass, resulting in severe air pollution over
   the main urban areas. Our results show that the foehn can affect air
   pollution through two effects: direct wind transport of air pollutants,
   and altering the air mass properties to inhibit boundary layer growth
   and thus indirectly aggravating air pollution. This study highlights the
   need to further investigate the foehn and its impacts on air pollution
   in the BTH region.}},

Abstract = {{Passive leg raising (PLR) is a convenient and reliable test to predict
   fluid responsiveness. The ability of thoracic electrical bioimpedance
   cardiography (TEB) to monitor changes of cardiac output (CO) during PLR
   is unknown. In the present study, we measured CO in 61 patients with
   shock or dyspnea by TEB and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) during
   PLR procedure. Positive PLR responsiveness was defined as the
   velocity-time integral (VTI) >= 10\% after PLR. TTE measured VTI in the
   left ventricular output tract. The predictive value of TEB parameters in
   PLR responders was tested. Furthermore, the agreement of absolute CO
   values between TEB and TTE measurements was assessed. Among the 61
   patients, there were 28 PLR-responders and 33 non-responders.
   Twenty-seven patients were diagnosed with shock and 34 patients with
   dyspnea, with 55.6\% (15/27) and 54.6\% (18/34) non-responders,
   respectively. A change in TEB measured CO (Delta CO) >= 9.8\% predicted
   PLR responders with 75.0\% sensitivity and 78.8\% specificity, the area
   under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was 0.79. The
   Delta d(2)Z/dt(2) (a secondary derivative of the impedance wave) showed
   the best predictive value with AUROC of 0.90, the optimal cut point was
   -7.1\% with 85.7\% sensitivity and 87.9\% specificity. Bias between TEB
   and TTE measured CO was 0.12 L/min, and the percentage error was 65.8\%.
   TEB parameters had promising performance in predicting PLR responders,
   and the Delta d(2)Z/dt(2) had the best predictive value. The CO values
   measured by TEB were not interchangeable with TTE in critically ill
   settings.}},

Title = {{Clinical Study of Three-Dimensional Laparoscopic Partial Nephrectomy for
   the Treatment of Highly Complex Renal Tumors with RENAL Nephrometry
   Scores of >= 10 Points}},
Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Aims. To examine the safety and feasibility of three-dimensional (3-D)
   laparoscopic partial nephrectomy for clinically complex renal tumors.
   Materials and Methods. We retrospectively evaluated 76 patients who
   underwent a 3-D (n=42; age, 54.6 +/- 12.2 years) or two-dimensional
   (2-D) laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (n=34; age, 54.8 +/- 13.2 years)
   for renal tumors with RENAL nephrectomy scores of >= 10 points from the
   same surgical group between January 2017 and April 2020 in Ningbo
   Urology and Nephrology Hospital. Mean tumor diameter, operation time,
   warm ischemic time, amount of intraoperative blood loss, postoperative
   hospitalization time, hospitalization cost, perioperative complication
   rate, and renal function were compared. Results. The operation time
   (154.6 +/- 45.1 min) and warm ischemic time (22.5 +/- 6.8 min) in the
   3-D laparoscopic group were significantly lower than those in the 2-D
   laparoscopic group (193.0 +/- 59.2 min, p=0.001 and 28.7 +/- 7.8 min,
   p=0.0002, respectively). No significant differences in amount of
   intraoperative blood loss (p=0.642), length of postoperative hospital
   stay (p=0.541), perioperative complication rate (p=0.860), total
   hospital cost (p=0.641), and renal function changes including estimated
   glomerular filtration rate and serum creatinine (p>0.05) were found
   between the two groups. Conclusion. Our preliminary experience showed
   that the 3-D laparoscopic imaging system significantly shortened the
   operation and renal ischemic times, which are more conducive to partial
   resection of highly complex renal tumors.}},

Journal = {{EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{Fructus anisi stellati (FAS) is an anise-scented star-shaped fruit from
   Illicium verum tree. It is commonly consumed in many cultures as food
   and medicine, particularly as a remedy for infantile colic (IC). The
   elucidation of molecular mechanisms of action would contribute to the
   understanding of the traditional therapy of FAS and help to guide the
   preclinical and clinical study of this herb. The aim is to investigate
   the key therapeutic compounds of FAS and to explore the underlying
   molecular mechanisms of FAS therapy. The chemical compounds of FAS were
   obtained through data mining on TCMSP and ADME screening, and the common
   targets of the FAS compounds and the IC-correlated diseases were
   obtained from PharmMapper, GeneCards, and OMIM databases. GO and KEGG
   databases were used for molecular function and pathway enrichment.
   Cytoscape was used for network construction and analysis. SystemsDock
   was used for molecular docking. Three key compounds (i.e., quercetin,
   luteolin, and kaempferol), 19 targets, 7 molecular pathways, and 12
   IC-correlated diseases were identified to be involved in the molecular
   mechanisms of FAS for the treatment of IC. This work showed that three
   therapeutic modules were primarily engaged in the molecular mechanisms
   of FAS for IC therapy, including the inhibition of inflammatory
   reactions, stimulating immunoglobulin A (IgA) production in the
   gastrointestinal tract, and enhancing the secretion of digestive
   enzymes.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},

Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, several studies of human predictive learning
   demonstrated better learning about outcomes that have previously been
   experienced as consistently predictable compared to outcomes previously
   experienced as less predictable, namely the outcome predictability
   effect. As this effect may have wide-reaching implications for current
   theories of associative learning, the present study aimed to examine the
   generality of the effect with a human goal-tracking paradigm, employing
   three different designs to manipulate the predictability of outcomes in
   an initial training phase. In contrast to the previous studies, learning
   in a subsequent phase, when every outcome was equally predictable by
   novel cues, was not reliably affected by the outcomes' predictability in
   the first phase. This lack of an outcome predictability effect provides
   insights into the parameters of the effect and its underlying
   mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Manganese oxides and carbon materials are both desirable catalysts for
   persulfate (PS) advanced oxidation processes in environmental
   remediation. Nevertheless, manganese oxides suffer from low reusability
   while carbon materials face the problem of limited catalytic efficiency.
   For the purpose of making full use of the advantages of the two
   materials as well as avoiding their shortcomings, carbon-coated Mn3O4
   composites (Mn3O4/C) with a regular nanocube structure were designed to
   activate PS for the removal of organics, and the catalytic processes
   were deeply investigated. The catalyst prepared at 400 degrees C with a
   precursor ratio (glucose/KMnO4) of 0.5 exhibited the best catalytic
   performance along with satisfactory reusability owing to the protection
   of the outer carbon layer. According to experimental results and density
   functional theory calculation, there were van der Waals interaction and
   a part of the strong attraction between the interface of PS and Mn3O4/C,
   which could be enhanced by inner Mn3O4 and thus promoted the electron
   transfer between PS and carbon shell, and the defective edges of the
   carbon layer with hydroxyl (C-OH) groups could act as active sites for
   PS activation. Radical (SO4 center dot-, (OH)-O-center dot) and
   nonradical (O-1(2)) oxidation processes both participated in the
   degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol, in which (OH)-O-center dot was
   dominating. This study not only proposed a promising catalyst for the
   degradation of pollutants but also expanded research ideas for future PS
   activation mechanism studies by integrating the experiment and
   simulation.}},

Abstract = {{The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) is usually based on clinical
   symptoms and signs of damage to the central nervous system, which is
   assessed using magnetic resonance imaging. The correct interpretation of
   these data requires excellent clinical expertise and experience. Deep
   neural networks aim to assist clinicians in identifying MS using imaging
   data. However, before such networks can be integrated into clinical
   workflow, it is crucial to understand their classification strategy. In
   this study, we propose to use a convolutional neural network to identify
   MS patients in combination with attribution algorithms to investigate
   the classification decisions. The network was trained using images
   acquired with susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), which is known to
   be sensitive to the presence of paramagnetic iron components and is
   routinely applied in imaging protocols for MS patients. Different
   attribution algorithms were used to the trained network resulting in
   heatmaps visualizing the contribution of each input voxel to the
   classification decision. Based on the quantitative image perturbation
   method, we selected DeepLIFT heatmaps for further investigation.
   Single-subject analysis revealed veins and adjacent voxels as signs for
   MS, while the population-based study revealed relevant brain areas
   common to most subjects in a class. This pattern was found to be stable
   across different echo times and also for a multi-echo trained network.
   Intensity analysis of the relevant voxels revealed a group difference,
   which was found to be primarily based on the T1w magnitude images, which
   are part of the SWI calculation. This difference was not observed in the
   phase mask data.}},

Abstract = {{A large body of literature has documented gender differences in

   different gender pairings of partner firm agents for supply chain
   performance. Using a production decision experiment which features
   asymmetric information and asymmetric risk sharing, we report three key
   findings. First, women are more collaborative than men in the role of
   both buying agents and supply agents. Second, information about
   counterparts' gender affects behaviors, as both genders are more
   collaborative when paired with women than when paired with men. Finally,
   all-women supply chain pairs outperform all other gender pairings in
   supply chain efficiency. Our results suggest that women exhibit an
   advantage over men in supply chain collaboration, and that employing
   women is advantageous irrespective of gender diversity concerns.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Despite limited and conflicting evidence,
   hydroxychloroquine, alone or in combination with azithromycin, is widely
   used in COVID-19 therapy.
   Methods: We performed a retrospective study of electronic health records
   of patients hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in US
   Veterans Health Administration medical centers between March 9, 2020 and
   April 29, 2020. Patients hospitalized within 24 h of diagnosis were
   classified based on their exposure to hydroxychloroquine alone (HC) or
   with azithromycin (HC+AZ) or no HC as treatments. The primary outcomes
   were mortality and use of mechanical ventilation.
   Findings: A total of 807 patients were evaluated. Compared to the no HC
   group, after propensity score adjustment for clinical characteristics,
   the risk of death from any cause was higher in the HC group (adjusted
   hazard ratio {[}aHR], 1.83; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 1.16-2.89;
   p = 0.009), but not in the HC+AZ group (aHR, 1.31; 95\% CI, 0.80-2.15; p
   = 0.28). Both the propensity-score-adjusted risks of mechanical
   ventilation and death after mechanical ventilation were not
   significantly different in the HC group (aHR, 1.19; 95\% CI, 0.78-1.82;
   p = 0.42 and aHR, 2.11; 95\% CI, 0.96-4.62; p = 0.06, respectively) or
   in the HC+AZ group (aHR, 1.09; 95\% CI, 0.72-1.66; p = 0.69 and aHR,
   1.25; 95\% CI, 0.59-2.68; p = 0.56, respectively) compared to the no HC
   group.
   Conclusions: Among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, this
   retrospective study did not identify any significant reduction in
   mortality or in the need for mechanical ventilation with
   hydroxychloroquine treatment with or without azithromycin.}},

Journal = {{BRITISH JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY}},
Abstract = {{Bariatric surgery is an effective treatment for patients with idiopathic
   intracranial hypertension (IIH), a condition that is associated with
   skull base defects. A 55-year-old woman presented with symptoms of
   intractable nausea and vomiting, followed by headache and confusion two
   weeks after an elective laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy
   procedure. She had a presumed diagnosis of IIH and a remote history of
   CSF oto/rhinorrhea treated with a lumbar peritoneal (LP) shunt. Computed
   tomography (CT) scan of the head revealed tension pneumocephalus with
   midline shift and dehiscence of the tegmen. The patient underwent
   emergent craniotomy for decompression of the air-filled temporal lobe,
   clamping of the LP shunt, and repair of the skull base defect. Caution
   should be exercised in obese patients with a history of CSF leak
   secondary to a middle fossa skull base defect when being evaluated for

Abstract = {{Alongside Edward, Lemieux was among the earliest researchers studying
   negative hyperconjugation (i.e., the anomeric effect) or the preference
   for gauche conformations about the C1-O5 bond in carbohydrates. Lemieux
   also studied an esoteric, if not controversial, theory known as the
   reverse anomeric effect (RAE). This theory is used to rationalize
   scenarios where predicted anomeric stabilization does not occur. One
   such example is the Kochetkov amination where reducing end amines exist
   solely as the beta-anomer. Herein, we provide a brief account of
   Lemieux's contributions to the field of stereoelectronics and apply this
   knowledge toward the synthesis of beta-amino human milk oligosaccharides
   (beta Alpha-HMOs). These molecules were evaluated for their ability to
   inhibit growth and biofilm production in Group B Streptococcus (GBS) and
   Staphylococcus aureus. While the parent HMOs lacked antimicrobial and
   antibiofilm activity, their beta-amino derivatives significantly
   inhibited biofilm formation in both species. Field emission gun-scanning
   single electron microscopy (FEG-SEM) revealed that treatment with
   beta-amino HMOs significantly inhibits bacterial adherence and
   eliminates the ability of both microbes to form biofilms.}},

   those of analogous organic buta-1,3-diyne (RC  CC  CR) and
   1,4-diethynylbenzene (RC  CC6H4C  CR) compounds for comparative
   purposes. The terminal thioether functional groups have an affinity for
   binding to the surface of gold electrodes and are considered as anchor
   groups in the design of molecules for study within metal|molecule|metal
   molecular junctions. The influence of the Lewis acidic and p-basic
   thioether moiety on a number of physical properties important to the
   electrical behavior of molecules within molecular junctions has been
   explored using spectroscopic, electrochemical, and quantum chemical
   methods. The thioether functional group serves as a moderately strong
   p-electron-donating substituent, similar in electronic character to the
   OMe group, resulting in relatively high lying HOMOs that are delocalized
   over the length of the molecule and well-suited to promote coherent
   tunneling within the junction. In addition, the facile oxidation
   processes and the relatively small reorganization energies associated
   with the one-electron oxidation of these compounds indicate the
   potential for effective hopping mechanisms of charge transport through
   longer structures based on these organometallic motifs.}},

Abstract = {{Recreating the healing microenvironment is essential to regulate
   cell-material interactions and ensure the integration of biomaterials.
   To repair bone, such bioactivity can be achieved by mimicking its
   extracellular matrix (ECM) and by stimulating integrin and growth factor
   (GF) signaling. However, current approaches relying on the use of GFs,
   such as bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2), entail clinical risks.
   Here, a biomimetic peptide integrating the RGD cell adhesive sequence
   and the osteogenic DWIVA motif derived from the wrist epitope of BMP-2
   is presented. The approach offers the advantage of having a spatial
   control over the single binding of integrins and BMP receptors. Such
   multifunctional platform is designed to incorporate
   3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine to bind metallic oxides with high affinity in
   a one step process. Functionalization of glass substrates with the
   engineered peptide is characterized by physicochemical methods, proving
   a successful surface modification. The biomimetic interfaces
   significantly improve the adhesion of C2C12 cells, inhibit myotube
   formation, and activate the BMP-dependent signaling via p38. These
   effects are not observed on surfaces displaying only one bioactive
   motif, a mixture of both motifs or soluble DWIVA. These data prove the
   biological potential of recreating the ECM and engaging in integrin and
   GF crosstalk via molecular-based mimics.}},

Abstract = {{AIM: To introduce a new surgical technique, air-bubble technique for the
   management of posterior capsule rupture (PCR) and to evaluate the safety
   and efficacy of the technique.
   METHODS: A retrospective case series analysis of 24 eyes of 24 patients,
   in which the air bubble technique was used for the management of PCR,
   was performed. Once PCR occurred, a dispersive ophthalmic viscosurgical
   device (OVD) was injected into the tear. And small volumes (0.20.3 mL)
   of air bubbles were injected beneath the OVD. The air bubble served as a
   physical barrier and supported the posterior capsule.
   RESULTS: After surgery, none of the patients had serious complications
   during the follow-up period of 1y. Extension of the PCR size occurred in
   only 2 cases, and additional OVD injection was required only in 3 cases.
   Air bubbles imparted great stability to the nuclear pieces and the
   posterior capsule.
   CONCLUSION: The air-bubble technique may be considered a safe and
   effective procedure for managing a PCR. It may be of value to the
   inexperienced cataract surgeon.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - This study aims to explore whether the COVID-19-related
   circumstances hindered these academic-related variables.
   Design Methodology Approach - The authors surveyed two groups of
   undergraduate business students (42\% male) who completed the
   questionnaires at the beginning and at the end of the semester. One
   group of students attended only face-to-face classes in the 2018/2019
   academic year (n = 126) and the other group transitioned to online
   classes because of the COVID-19 outbreak in the 2019/2020 academic year
   (n = 99).
   Findings - The findings show no statistically significant group
   differences between the pre- and post-test in students' intrinsic and
   extrinsic motivation, feelings of attachment to the university and
   engagement dimensions of absorption and vigour. Nevertheless, a moderate
   negative effect was found in the dedication engagement dimension.
   Practical Implications - The authors discuss the main results in terms
   of some practices that may contribute towards attenuating the effects of
   future emerging pandemics in the higher education setting.
   Originality Value - The COVID-19 pandemic imposed a rapid transition to
   online instruction in education institutions worldwide. However, it
   remains unclear to date how students' engagement, motivation and
   attachment to the university were negatively affected by the first
   COVID-19 outbreak.}},

Title = {{Legal issues in automated vehicles: critically considering the potential
   role of consent and interactive digital interfaces}},
Journal = {{HUMANITIES \& SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{Some of the first `automated' vehicles to be deployed on our roads will
   require a system of shared driving with a human driver. While this
   creates technical and operational challenges, the law must also
   facilitate such a transfer. One method may be to obtain the driver's
   consent to share operational responsibility and to delineate legal
   responsibility between vehicle and driver in the event of an accident.
   Consent is a voluntary agreement where an individual is aware of the
   potential consequences of their consent, including the risks. The driver
   of a partially automated vehicle must be informed of potential risks
   before giving consent to share operational responsibility. This paper
   will refer to the inherent dangers associated with shared operational
   responsibility, in particular where there has been a request for the
   driver to take back control from the automated vehicle during the
   journey. Drivers are likely to experience delay in regaining situational
   awareness, making such operational transfers hazardous. It is argued
   that where an interactive digital interface is used to convey
   information, such as driver responsibility, risk and legal terms,
   drivers may fail to sufficiently process such communications due to
   fundamental weaknesses in human-machine interaction. The use of an
   interactive digital interface alone may be inadequate to effectively
   communicate information to drivers. If the problems identified are not
   addressed, it is argued that driver consent may be inconsequential, and
   fail to facilitate a predicable demarcation of legal responsibility
   between automated vehicles and drivers. Ongoing research into automated
   vehicle driver training is considered as part of the preparation
   required to design driver education to a level whereby drivers may be
   able to sufficiently understand the responsibilities involved in
   operating a partially automated vehicle, which has implications for
   future driver training, licensing and certification.}},

Abstract = {{Spaceflight missions can cause immune system dysfunction in astronauts
   with little understanding of immune outcomes in deep space. This study
   assessed immune responses in mice following ground-based, simulated deep
   spaceflight conditions, compared with data from astronauts on
   International Space Station missions. For ground studies, we simulated
   microgravity using the hindlimb unloaded mouse model alone or in
   combination with acute simulated galactic cosmic rays or solar particle
   events irradiation. Immune profiling results revealed unique immune
   diversity following each experimental condition, suggesting each
   stressor results in distinct circulating immune responses, with clear
   consequences for deep spaceflight. Circulating plasma microRNA sequence
   analysis revealed involvement in immune system dysregulation.
   Furthermore, a large astronaut cohort showed elevated inflammation
   during low-Earth orbit missions, thereby supporting our simulated ground
   experiments in mice. Herein, circulating immune biomarkers are defined
   by distinct deep space irradiation types coupled to simulated
   microgravity and could be targets for future space health initiatives.}},

Abstract = {{We determine the activity of catalytic carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation as
   a function of the size of gold nanoparticles (Au NP), their weight
   loading, and their interfacial intimacy with similarly sized TiO2 NPs
   covalently bonded in an aerogel support. We use this Au+TiO2 series to
   correlate mechanisms that influence catalytic activity including hot
   electron injection and production, electron-hole pair formation, oxygen
   vacancy content, and electronic metal-support interaction (EMSI)
   stemming from photoinduced charge transfer from TiO2 to Au. The Au
   weight loading varies from 1 and 8 wt \%, and Au NPs are either
   entrained within the oxide network of the aerogel during sol-gel
   synthesis (Au-IN-TiO2) or deposited on as-formed TiO2 aerogel
   (Au-ON/TiO2). Electron tomography reveals that Au-IN-TiO2 exhibits
   greater metal parallel to metal-oxide intimacy than Au-ON/TiO2 at the
   same weight loading, while increasing Au content (especially with
   Au-ON/TiO2) yields broader size distributions, larger Au NPs, and lower
   Au parallel to TiO2 intimacy. Comparing broadband photoactivity to dark
   activity reveals that high Au parallel to TiO2 intimacy and monodisperse
   small (similar to 5 nm) Au NPs diminishes catalytic activity under
   broadband illumination, while Au+TiO2 composites with high weight
   loading, some large (>50 nm) Au NPs, and decreased Au parallel to TiO2
   intimacy enhance activity under broadband illumination.}},

   COVID-19: a fragile consensus}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{Background In March 2020, as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19)
   pandemic was spreading across the globe, many countries have implemented
   unprecedented lockdown measures. But how populations did react to these
   measures? We examined the case of France. Our aims were threefold:
   assessing some aspects of their impact on French's daily living
   conditions; investigating their attitudes toward the lockdown;
   investigating the factors associated with these attitudes. Methods A
   cross-sectional online survey was carried out 10 days after the
   nationwide lockdown (from March 27th to March 29th 2020), among a
   representative sample of the mainland French population aged 18 and
   over. A quota sampling method was applied to achieve a sample of 1012
   respondents. We used a cluster analysis to obtain contrasted attitudinal
   profiles, and logistic regressions to investigated which factors were
   associated to these profiles. Results After 10 days of lockdown, there
   were already significant consequences regarding respondents' living
   conditions and mental health. Most respondents supported the current
   lockdown. However, it appeared as a stopgap measure due to a lack of
   alternatives, and a large majority acknowledged its heavy drawbacks. We
   found three contrasted attitudinal profiles: full support (38\%), strong
   but critical support (31\%), limited support (31\%). Regarding
   respondents' SES, low-income and low-education respondents were more
   likely to display critical or limited support to the lockdown, as well
   as those who reported deteriorated living conditions or psychological
   distress. Conclusions In France, the large public support to the
   lockdown was fragile. First, it was a critical consensus anchored in
   current controversies and recent social struggles. Second, it was weaker
   among people with a lows SES, especially since the lockdown have
   exacerbated preexisting social inequalities.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Studies regarding differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in Parkinson's
   disease (PD) have focused on common upstream regulators or dysregulated
   pathways or ontologies; however, the relationships between DEGs and
   disease-related or cell type-enriched genes have not been systematically
   studied. Meta-analysis of DEGs (meta-DEGs) are expected to overcome the
   limitations, such as replication failure and small sample size of
   previous studies. Purpose
   Meta-DEGs were performed to investigate dysregulated genes enriched with
   neurodegenerative disorder causative or risk genes in a
   phenotype-specific manner. Methods
   Six microarray datasets from PD patients and controls, for which
   substantia nigra sample transcriptome data were available, were
   downloaded from the NINDS data repository. Meta-DEGs were performed
   using two methods, combining p-values and combing effect size, and
   common DEGs were used for secondary analyses. Gene sets of cell
   type-enriched or disease-related genes for PD, Alzheimer's disease (AD),
   and hereditary progressive ataxia were constructed by curation of public
   databases and/or published literatures. Results
   Our meta-analyses revealed 449 downregulated and 137 upregulated genes.
   Overrepresentation analyses with cell type-enriched genes were
   significant in neuron-enriched genes but not in astrocyte- or
   microglia-enriched genes. Meta-DEGs were significantly enriched in
   causative genes for hereditary disorders accompanying parkinsonism but
   not in genes associated with AD or hereditary progressive ataxia.
   Enrichment of PD-related genes was highly significant in downregulated
   DEGs but insignificant in upregulated genes. Conclusion
   Downregulated meta-DEGs were associated with PD-related genes, but not
   with other neurodegenerative disorder genes. These results highlight
   disease phenotype-specific changes in dysregulated genes in PD.}},

Abstract = {{The Fourier transform of a N point time series is a N point complex
   series, while the S-transform (ST) of the same time series is a N x N 2D
   time-frequency complex matrix. The computation and storage of N-2 - N
   additional points are a major drag on the usage of ST. In this study the
   compact S-transform (cST) is presented, with efficiencies brought about
   through computation of only selected voices (frequencies). The cST
   spectrum has uncomputed voice gaps that increase in width towards the
   higher frequencies. Plot of the cST magnitude spectrum is virtually
   indistinguishable from the ST magnitude plot. Local spectrum at any spot
   on the cST can be quickly examined in detail through interpolation. The
   cST requires the computation of approximately 3 root N voices compared
   to {[}N/2] + 1 for the ST. The proportion of computed voices decrease
   for larger N. For N = 1024, similar to 20\% of the voices in the
   time-frequency spectrum is computed; for N = 2048 only 14\% of the
   voices is computed. For applications, such as audio and speech signal
   processing where segments of one million samples are not uncommon, <1\%
   of the voices are computed, thereby reducing the computation time by
   similar to 99\%.}},

Abstract = {{Biocontainment is an essential feature when deploying genetically
   modified organisms (GMOs) in open system applications, as variants
   escaping their intended operating environments could negatively impact
   ecosystems and human health. To avoid breaches resulting from metabolic
   cross-feeding, horizontal gene transfer, and/or genetic mutations,
   synthetic auxotrophs have been engineered to become dependent on
   exogenously supplied xenobiotics, such as noncanonical amino acids
   (ncAAs). The incorporation of these abiological building blocks into
   essential proteins constitutes a first step toward constructing
   xenobiological barriers between GMOs and their environments. To
   transition synthetic auxotrophs further away from familiar biology, we
   demonstrate how bacterial growth can be confined by transition-metal
   complexes that catalyze the formation of an essential ncAA through
   new-to-nature reactions. Specifically, using a homogeneous ruthenium
   complex enabled us to localize bacterial growth on solid media, while
   heterogeneous palladium nanoparticles could be recycled and deployed up
   to five consecutive times to ensure the survival of synthetic auxotrophs
   in liquid cultures.}},

Abstract = {{Heteroatom nitrogen doping is considered an effective strategy to
   enhance the electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption capacity of reduced
   graphene oxide (RGO). Herein, nitrogen-doped RGO aerogels (NGAs) are
   synthesized via hydrothermal self-assembly followed by lyophilization
   processes. Results of micromorphology analysis show that the as-prepared
   NGAs display unique 3D porous and netlike structure. Moreover, the
   effects of nitrogen doping and filler contents on EMW absorption
   properties of NGAs are studied. The as-synthesized NGA with nitrogen
   content of 9.41 at\% and a bulk density of 8.7 mg cm(-3) presents the
   integrated optimal EMW absorption performance. Specifically, the minimum
   reflection loss of -56.4 dB is achieved and maximum absorption bandwidth
   of 6.8 GHz is reached, covering the whole Ku band. In addition, the
   possible EMW absorption mechanisms of obtained NGAs are proposed.
   Therefore, the as-synthesized NGAs can be exploited as promising
   high-efficiency and lightweight EMW absorbers.}},

Abstract = {{Non-human primate models will expedite therapeutics and vaccines for
   coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to clinical trials. Here, we compare
   acute severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
   infection in young and old rhesus macaques, baboons and old marmosets.
   Macaques had clinical signs of viral infection, mild to moderate
   pneumonitis and extra-pulmonary pathologies, and both age groups
   recovered in two weeks. Baboons had prolonged viral RNA shedding and
   substantially more lung inflammation compared with macaques.
   Inflammation in bronchoalveolar lavage was increased in old versus young
   baboons. Using techniques including computed tomography imaging,
   immunophenotyping, and alveolar/peripheral cytokine response and
   immunohistochemical analyses, we delineated cellular immune responses to
   SARS-CoV-2 infection in macaque and baboon lungs, including innate and
   adaptive immune cells and a prominent type-I interferon response.
   Macaques developed T-cell memory phenotypes/responses and bystander
   cytokine production. Old macaques had lower titres of
   SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody levels compared with young macaques.
   Acute respiratory distress in macaques and baboons recapitulates the
   progression of COVID-19 in humans, making them suitable as models to
   test vaccines and therapies.

Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{Objective/Background: Nocturnal panic involves experiencing panic
   attacks out of a sleeping state without obvious causes. Roughly half of
   patients with panic disorder will experience nocturnal panic in addition
   to panic attacks while awake, or daytime panic. Like daytime panic,
   nocturnal panic also occurs in other disorders such as PTSD. The Fear of
   Loss of Vigilance theory is currently the only model available to
   explain nocturnal panic. It suggests nocturnal panickers fear states in
   which they cannot easily react to or protect themselves from danger. The
   current study sought to expand upon the existing theory by including
   constructs from the broader anxiety literature. Nocturnal panickers were
   expected to report higher scores on these measures when compared to
   daytime panickers and non-panickers.
   Participants: A sample of 166 participants were screened for panic
   history.
   Methods: Participants completed self-report measures regarding panic
   attacks, fear of sleep, intolerance of uncertainty, responsibility for
   harm, and fear of loss of vigilance.
   Results: Measures of fear of sleep and responsibility for harm
   successfully differentiated nocturnal from daytime panickers, whereas
   measures of intolerance of uncertainty and fear of loss of vigilance did
   not.
   Conclusions: These results provide partial support for the Fear of Loss
   of Vigilance theory. Modifications to the theory to incorporate
   additional constructs are suggested.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, a magnetorheological shear thickening fluid (MRSTF) was
   fabricated based on magnetorheological (MR) material and shear
   thickening fluid (STF). The STF was firstly fabricated as the liquid
   phase, and carbonyl iron particles were then mixed with the
   prefabricated STF to synthesise a series of MRSTFs with various iron
   concentrations. Then, a rheometer was used to measure their viscosities
   by varying the shear rate under various magnetic fields. Both static and
   dynamic tests were conducted to study the rheology of MRSTFs under
   different magnetic fields. The tested results revealed that the MRSTF
   showed shear thickening under zero magnetic field and MR effect with
   increasing applied magnetic field. It was also noted that the viscosity
   of the MRSTFs can be controlled by both shear rate and the applied
   magnetic field. The concentration of iron particles played an important
   role in the MRSTFs' rheological properties. The MRSTFs with higher iron
   particle concentrations revealed lower shear thickening effects but
   higher MR effects, which means the MRSTF with higher iron concentration
   can be treated as an effective MR fluid. Meanwhile, the MRSTF with low
   iron concentration displays good shear thickening effect under weak
   magnetic field. To summarise the behavior of MRSTFs with various iron
   concentrations and under different magnetic fields, three regions were
   proposed to provide guidelines to design MRSTFs and assist in their
   applications.}},

Title = {{Role of NDE1 in the Development and Evolution of the Gyrified Cortex}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{An expanded cortex is a hallmark of human neurodevelopment and endows
   increased cognitive capabilities. Recent work has shown that the cell
   cycle-related gene NDE1 is essential for proper cortical development.
   Patients who have mutations in NDE1 exhibit congenital microcephaly as a
   primary phenotype. At the cellular level, NDE1 is essential for
   interkinetic nuclear migration and mitosis of radial glial cells, which
   translates to an indispensable role in neurodevelopment. The nuclear
   migration function of NDE1 is well conserved across Opisthokonta. In
   mammals, multiple isoforms containing alternate terminal exons, which
   influence the functionality of NDE1, have been reported. It has been
   noted that the pattern of terminal exon usage mirrors patterns of
   cortical complexity in mammals. To provide context to these findings,
   here, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature regarding
   NDE1, its molecular biology and physiological relevance at the cellular
   and organismal levels. In particular, we outline the potential roles of
   NDE1 in progenitor cell behavior and explore the spectrum of NDE1
   pathogenic variants. Moreover, we assessed the evolutionary conservation
   of NDE1 and interrogated whether the usage of alternative terminal exons
   is characteristic of species with gyrencephalic cortices. We found that
   gyrencephalic species are more likely to express transcripts that use
   the human-associated terminal exon, whereas lissencephalic species tend
   to express transcripts that use the mouse-associated terminal exon.
   Among gyrencephalic species, the human-associated terminal exon was
   preferentially expressed by those with a high order of gyrification.
   These findings underscore phylogenetic relationships between the
   preferential usage of NDE1 terminal exon and high-order gyrification,
   which provide insight into cortical evolution underlying high-order
   brain functions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study of the conversion pathway of acetaminophen
   (APAP) and amoxicillin (AMO) in water by ultrasound as a single
   degradation method. Results showed that the sonication power output,
   continuous vs. pulsed ultrasound and starting concentration, result in
   different conversion pathways, as well as the simultaneous presence of
   the two molecules reduces the degradation yield. Hydroquinone and
   hydroxyl-hydroquinone were detected as acetaminophen by-products, while
   amoxicillin degraded into four main products. Accordingly, we proposed a
   conversion pathway mechanism and we finally regressed the amoxicillin
   conversion kinetics as a function of the ultrasonic power. APAP was more
   resistant to continuous sonication either at low (25 ppm) or high (100
   ppm) starting concentration. On the contrary, ultrasound was able to
   convert AMO up to 56 \% starting from a concentration of 25 ppm. We
   ascribed this behavior to the presence of a higher number of hydroxyl
   groups present in the molecule compared to APAP. Moreover, when
   ultrasound were applied in pulses, it resulted in an energy saving of
   more than 50 \% for a 2 \% lower AMO conversion.}},

Abstract = {{In the design of joints and peripheral members of shear panel dampers,
   the sectional design corresponding to the increase in the strength of
   the shear panel is required. Therefore, if a shear panel damper with a
   small increase in proof stress can be achieved, a reasonable design of
   the joint and peripheral member can be done. In this study, the
   feasibility of the load-displacement relationship control of the shear
   panel was analytically examined by adjusting the web imperfection shape.
   First, a method for searching a web imperfection shape to reproduce a
   target load-displacement relationship was proposed. In this method, the
   web imperfection shape was expressed as convolution of some mode shapes.
   Subsequently, each mode coefficient was changed using the modal
   iterative error correction method to fit the target load-displacement
   relationship. Then, the method searches for a web imperfection shape
   using example problems. The results indicate that the web imperfection
   shape that matched the target load-displacement relationship could be
   searched by the proposed method. In addition, the sensitivity to the
   variation in the amount of web imperfection was also examined. It was
   confirmed that the load-displacement relationship of the shear panel
   damper can be controlled by the web imperfection shape. However, the
   present examination is limited to the analytical examination, and the
   feasibility of the production of the actual member has not been
   examined. A future study should verify if the actual member of the shear
   panel damper with web imperfection shape, searched by the proposed
   method, shows the target load-displacement relationship.}},

Title = {{The relationship between pain and herniation radiology in giant lumbar
   disc herniation causing severe sciatica: 15 cases}},
Journal = {{BRITISH JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   To evaluate conservative treatment of giant lumbar disc herniation in
   patients with extreme pain and to assess temporal changes in pain levels
   and radiological findings with short-term follow-up.
   Methods
   A total of 15 patients with severe pain (as measured by visual analog
   scale {[}VAS]) due to giant lumbar disc herniation and without
   neurological deficits were included. All patients received conservative
   treatment and were followed weekly for pain and medication assessment.
   MRI was performed at baseline, second month and fourth month to
   calculate disc herniation volume. The changes in disc herniation and
   pain were evaluated.
   Results
   There was no relationship between pain and the regression of disc
   herniation in these five females and ten males with a mean age of 41.4
   years. MRI results showed an average of 20.3\% and 20.4\% regression of
   disc herniation from baseline to second month, and second month to
   fourth month, respectively. Whereas, pain levels had reduced from an
   average of 90.8-13.53 by the second month, and to 3.13 by the fourth
   month, indicating significant success with conservative treatment.
   Conclusions
   Regardless of the size of the herniation and the severity of the pain,
   patients with giant lumbar disc herniation should be encouraged to
   undergo conservative treatment, given that the patient does not have
   urinary-fecal incontinence, foot drop or progressive neurodeficit.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of DNA methylation on gene behavior and its consequent

   functional studies have tended to focus on quite specialized

   have studied DNA methylation in the hemimetabolan insect Blattella
   germanica. In this cockroach, a gene involved in DNA methylation, DNA
   methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), is expressed in early embryogenesis. In our
   experiments, RNAi of DNMT1 reduces DNA methylation and impairs
   blastoderm formation. Using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing
   and transcriptome analyses, we observed that methylated genes are
   associated with metabolism and are highly expressed, whereas
   unmethylated genes are related to signaling and show low expression.
   Moreover, methylated genes show greater expression change and less

   nyctalopia over 1 year. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/50 in both
   eyes with reduced color vision. Goldmann visual field showed bilateral
   cecocentral scotomas and generalized constriction of the visual fields.
   This led to an electroretinogram showing an electronegative pattern
   consistent with autoimmune retinopathies. Infectious workup was
   negative. Anti-retinal antibodies were positive, leading to a presumed
   diagnosis of cancer-associated retinopathy (CAR). Imaging showed a
   previously unknown left renal lower pole mass, and she underwent a
   radical nephrectomy. Biopsy showed nuclear grade-3 clear cell renal
   carcinoma staged T1. The patient was treated with oral prednisone with
   no ocular improvement. We report on a rare case of clear cell renal
   carcinoma causing CAR. CAR is an important paraneoplastic syndrome to
   diagnose since the majority of ocular cases precede other manifestations
   of malignancy. Therefore, a timely diagnosis of CAR can be lifesaving or
   at least life-extending.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AMERICAN COLLEGE HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The current study aimed to compare endorsement of the
   muscular- and thin-ideals alone, as well as simultaneous endorsement of
   both as representative of the fit-ideal and examine potential negative
   correlates of each type of ideal internalization. Participants:
   Participants were 300 female undergraduate students. Methods:
   Participants completed measures of internalization of the thin- and
   muscular-ideals, body dissatisfaction, body checking, and body
   avoidance. Results: Analyses revealed that approximately 24.9\% of
   participants endorsed scores in the upper quartile on thin-ideal
   internalization, and 27.4\% of participants fell in the upper quartile
   of muscular-ideal internalization, while 10.3\% endorsed high
   internalization of both ideals. Analyses revealed that individuals
   endorsing only the thin-ideal reported significantly higher levels of
   body dissatisfaction and body avoidance than those endorsing the
   fit-ideal. Conclusions: Overall, findings suggested that thin- and
   muscular-ideal internalization present different patterns of association
   depending on whether an individual endorses one or both of these body
   ideals.}},

Title = {{Can Political Trust Help to Explain Elite Policy Support and Public
   Behaviour in Times of Crisis? Evidence from the United Kingdom at the
   Height of the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic}},
Journal = {{POLITICAL STUDIES}},
Abstract = {{Trust between representatives and citizens is regarded as central to
   effective governance in times of peace and uncertainty. This article
   tests that assumption by engaging elite and mass perspectives to provide
   a 360-degree appraisal of vertical and horizontal policy coordination in
   a crisis scenario. Specifically, a multi-dimensional conception of
   political trust, anchored in psychological studies of interpersonal
   relations, is operationalised in the context of the United Kingdom's
   response to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. Detailed analysis of data
   collected from 1045 members of the public and more than 250 elected
   politicians suggests that particular facets of political trust and
   distrust may have contributed to levels of mass behavioural compliance
   and elite policy support in the UK at the height of the COVID-19 crisis.
   These findings help to evaluate policy success during a unique and
   challenging moment while contributing theoretically and methodologically
   to broader studies of political trust and governance.}},

Abstract = {{Fabrication of nonstoichiometric metal oxides containing oxygen
   vacancies (OVs) has been an effective strategy to modulate their
   (photo)catalytic or (photo)electrochemical performances which are all
   affected by charge transfer at the interface and in the bulk.
   Considerable efforts are still needed to achieve tunability of OVs, as
   well as their quantitative characterization. Herein, a one-step flame
   synthesis method is reported for the first time for fast fabrication of
   blue TiO2-x with controllable defect content and location.
   Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) analysis is applied for the first
   time and found to be an excellent technique in both differentiating and
   quantifying OVs at the surface, grain boundary (GB), and bulk of TiO2-x.
   The results indicate that a moderate level of OVs can greatly enhance
   the charge transfer. Importantly, the OVs locked at GBs due to the
   thermal sintering of nanoparticles during the synthesis can facilitate
   the anchoring and reduction of Pt species.}},

Title = {{Improvement of Prediction Performance With Conjoint Molecular
   Fingerprint in Deep Learning}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 18}},
Abstract = {{The accurate predicting of physical properties and bioactivity of drug
   molecules in deep learning depends on how molecules are represented.
   Many types of molecular descriptors have been developed for quantitative
   structure-activity/property relationships quantitative
   structure-activity relationships (QSPR). However, each molecular
   descriptor is optimized for a specific application with encoding
   preference. Considering that standalone featurization methods may only
   cover parts of information of the chemical molecules, we proposed to
   build the conjoint fingerprint by combining two supplementary
   fingerprints. The impact of conjoint fingerprint and each standalone
   fingerprint on predicting performance was systematically evaluated in
   predicting the logarithm of the partition coefficient (logP) and binding
   affinity of protein-ligand by using machine learning/deep learning
   (ML/DL) methods, including random forest (RF), support vector regression
   (SVR), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), long short-term memory
   network (LSTM), and deep neural network (DNN). The results demonstrated
   that the conjoint fingerprint yielded improved predictive performance,
   even outperforming the consensus model using two standalone fingerprints
   among four out of five examined methods. Given that the conjoint
   fingerprint scheme shows easy extensibility and high applicability, we
   expect that the proposed conjoint scheme would create new opportunities
   for continuously improving predictive performance of deep learning by
   harnessing the complementarity of various types of fingerprints.}},

Abstract = {{The exocyst is a key factor in vesicle transport and is involved in cell
   secretion, cell growth, cell division and other cytological processes in
   eukaryotes. EXO70 is the key exocyst subunit. We obtained a gene,
   SHORT-ROOT 1 (SR1), through map-based cloning and genetic
   complementation. SR1 is a conserved protein with an EXO70 domain in
   plants. SR1 mutation affected the whole root-development process:
   producing shorter radicles, adventitious roots and lateral roots, and
   demonstrating abnormal xylem development, resulting in dwarfing and
   reduced water potential and moisture content. SR1 was largely expressed
   in the roots, but only in developing root meristems and tracheary
   elements. The shortness of the sr1 mutant roots was caused by the
   presence of fewer meristem cells. The in situ histone H4 expression
   patterns confirmed that cell proliferation during root development was
   impaired. Tracheary element dysplasia was caused by marked decreases in
   the inner diameters of and distances between the perforations of
   adjacent tracheary elements. The membrane transport of sr1 mutants was
   blocked, affecting cell division in the root apical region and the
   development of root tracheary elements. The study of SR1 will deepen our
   understanding of the function of EXO70 genes in Oryza sativa (rice) and
   guide future studies on the molecular mechanisms involved in plant root
   development.}},

Abstract = {{The efficient signal amplification capacity of several class 2
   CRISPR-Cas systems with trans-cleavage activity has exhibited great
   value in molecular diagnostics, but its potential application for
   non-nucleic-acid targets is yet underdeveloped. Here, we deploy
   CRISPR-Cas system for the ultrasensitive detection of protease
   biomarkers by the coupling of proteolysis-triggered transcription. In
   this strategy, a protease-activatable RNA polymerase is adopted for the
   conversion of each protease-catalyzed proteolysis event into the output
   of multiple programable RNA sequences by in vitro transcription, and the
   transcribed RNA subsequently serves as the guide RNA of Cas12a proteins
   with trans-cleavage activity. The rational design of the transcribed RNA
   efficiently couples the signal conversion and amplification of
   proteolysis-triggered transcription and the self-signal amplification of
   CRISPR-Cas12a, resulting in a two-stage amplified detection of target
   protease. The versatility of this strategy has been demonstrated in the
   detection of protease biomarkers including MMP-2 and thrombin with
   femtomolar sensitivity, which is 5-6 orders of magnitude lower than that
   of the standard peptide-based methods. Moreover, the proposed method has
   been further applied in the analysis of MMP-2 secreted by different
   cancer cell lines as well the assessment of MMP-2 activity in clinical
   serum samples, providing a generic method for the ultrasensitive
   detection of protease biomarkers in biochemical research and clinical
   diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{Endolithic microbes in coral reefs may act as a nutrient source for
   their coral hosts. Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations are causing
   ocean acidification (OA), which may affect marine organisms and
   ecosystems, especially calcifying organisms such as reef-building
   corals. However, knowledge of how OA affects marine microbes remains
   limited, and little research has been done on how coral endolithic
   communities respond to shifting environmental baselines. In this study,
   the endolithic communities of two common shallow water coral species,
   lsopora palifera and Porites lobata, were examined to investigate the
   microbial community dynamics under OA treatments. The colonies were
   placed in an environment with a partial pressure of carbon dioxide
   (pCO(2)) of 1,000 or 400 ppm (control) for 2 months. Several I. palifera
   colonies bleached and died at 1,000 ppm pCO(2), but the P. lobata
   colonies remained unaffected. Inversely, the endolithic community in P.
   lobata skeletons showed significant changes after OA treatment, whereas
   no significant dynamics were observed among the I. palifera endoliths.
   Our findings suggest that the skeletal structures of different coral
   species may play a key role in corals host and endoliths under future
   high-OA scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the effects of real earnings management on
   accounting conservatism, based on 2,121 A-share listed firms in Shanghai
   and Shenzhen from 2005 to 2017. The results indicate that real earnings
   management has a significant negative impact on listed firms' accounting
   conservatism. The real earnings management based on loss avoidance,
   seasoned equity offerings (SEO), maintaining growth and reversing loss
   reduces accounting conservatism, while that based on earnings smoothing
   incentive improves accounting conservatism. Real earnings management of
   firms with poor corporate governance has a more significant impact on
   accounting conservatism than firms with good corporate governance. The
   findings also offer reference for further strengthening listed firms'
   financial supervision, improving corporate governance structure, and
   promoting the healthy development of the securities market.}},

Abstract = {{Insomnia is highly prevalent among adolescents with psychiatric
   conditions and is known to aggravate psychiatric symptoms. Research on
   cognitive behaviour therapy for adolescents with comorbid insomnia
   (CBT-I) is still limited. The aim of this study was to investigate
   feasibility and preliminary effects of internet-delivered CBT for
   adolescents with insomnia comorbid to a psychiatric condition.
   Twenty-one patients (13-17 years) with comorbid insomnia were recruited
   from Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. All patients received 7 weeks of
   internet-delivered CBT-I with therapist support. Outcomes were assessed
   at baseline, post-treatment, and at a 4-month follow-up. The proportion
   of completed assessments was overall acceptable. Participants on average
   completed 4.48 (sd = 1.97) of the seven treatment modules and therapists
   on average spent 12.80 minutes (sd = 6.23) per patient and week. Results
   showed large statistically significant improvements on insomnia
   severity, sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency and sleep quality.
   Medium to large improvements were also seen on the psychiatric symptoms
   of depression, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, interpersonal sensitivity,
   paranoid ideation and psychoticism. These findings indicate that
   internet-delivered CBT is feasible and potentially promising for
   improving sleep and reducing psychiatric symptoms in adolescent
   psychiatric patients with insomnia and co-morbid psychiatric disorders.
   A larger randomised trial is warranted to verify these preliminary
   results.}},

   descriptors, and a library of solvent descriptors was built. The
   descriptors were converted into a reduced dimensionality form using an
   Autoencoder. Experimental yields were used to train a multilayered
   artificial neural network (ANN) surrogate model, which was used for the
   optimization and design of experiments (DoE). DoE was performed in an
   active learning mode to reduce the number of experiments required for
   reaction optimization. The final surrogate model identified
   1-chloropentane as a promising solvent, which resulted in an
   experimental yield of 93\%.}},

Abstract = {{Electrochemically reducing carbon dioxide (CO2RR) to ethylene is one of
   the most promising strategies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and
   simultaneously produce high value-added chemicals. However, the lack of
   catalysts with excellent activity and stability limits the large-scale
   application of this technology. In this work, a graphitic carbon nitride
   (g-C3N4)-supported Cu2O composite was fabricated, which exhibited a 32.2
   \% faradaic efficiency of C2H4 with a partial current density of -4.3 mA
   cm(-2) at -1.1 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in 0.1 m KHCO3
   electrolyte. The introduction of g-C3N4 support not only enhanced the
   uniform dispersion of Cu2O nanocubes, but also stabilized the important
   {*}CO intermediates. Moreover, the g-C3N4 itself had a good activity of
   reducing CO2 to form {*}CO, which enriched the key intermediates of C-C
   coupling around cuprous oxide. The findings highlight the importance of
   the g-C3N4 support, a unique two-dimensional material, including not
   only the strong CO2 adsorption and activation capacity but also its
   synergistic effect with the cuprous oxide in CO2RR selectivity.}},

Abstract = {{Regulating electron density at the active site by integrating
   contributions from multiple channels is an effective strategy to
   accelerate the reaction rate. Herein, the hydrolysis of ammonia borane
   (AB) is systematically studied on the NiCu alloy-loaded carbon nitride
   nanosheets (NixCuy/CNS). The TOF of AB hydrolysis for NiCu/CNS catalyst
   under visible light irradiation was nearly 3.5 times higher than that in
   the dark. Photoelectrochemical characterizations indicate that the
   improved photocatalytic activities originate from a combination of
   alloying effect, Mott-Schottky junction at the metal-semiconductor
   interface as well as the localized surface plasmon resonance induced
   under the visible light irradiation, which synergistically increase the
   local electron density at the active Ni sites. More importantly, the
   infrared spectra and isotope labeling-mass spectrometry methods were
   used to establish the source of hydrogen and unravel the reaction
   mechanism. It is suggested that the cleavages of B-H and O-H bonds are
   the initial steps of AB hydrolysis, which lead to the formation of
   intermediates M-H- (metal and electronegative H- from -BH3) and M-H+
   (metal and electropositive H+ from H2O), respectively. The H-2 molecule
   could form through three main paths as (1) two H atoms from -BH3, (2)
   two H atoms from H2O, and (3) one H atom from -BH3 and another from H2O.
   Results of density functional theory (DFT) calculations are consistent
   with the formation of electron-rich Ni sites in the NiCu, and the
   activation of H2O is a rate-limiting step (RLS). Redistribution of
   electrons in NiCu significantly enhances the adsorption of AB, the
   activation of H2O molecules, and the associative desorption of H adatoms
   as well, which effectively promote the cleavage of B-H and O-H bonds and
   release of H-2. This work gives a systematic mechanistic study on
   photocatalytic AB hydrolysis involving multichannel electron-transfer
   pathways, which will provide a powerful guidance for the rational design
   of active catalysts for AB hydrolysis through multipronged effects.}},

Abstract = {{A Ni-catalyzed aryl C-N bond cleavage of monoprotected anilines,
   N-arylsulfonamides, has been developed. A new N-heterocyclic carbene
   derived from benzoimidazole shows high reactivity for the C-N
   cleavage/C-C cross-coupling reaction. The ortho-directing group is not
   required to break the C-N bond of sulfonyl-protected anilines, which are
   not limited to p-extended anilines. The mechanistic studies have
   revealed that a sulfamidomagnesium salt is the key coupling
   intermediate.}},

Abstract = {{A search for heavy resonances decaying into a W or Z boson and a Higgs
   boson produced in proton - proton collisions at the Large Hadron
   Collider at root s = 13 TeV is presented. The analysis utilizes the
   dominant W -> q (q) over bar' or Z -> q (q) over bar and H -> b (b) over
   bar decays with substructure techniques applied to large-radius jets. A
   sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb(-1) collected
   with the ATLAS detector is analyzed and no significant excess of data is
   observed over the background prediction. The results are interpreted in
   the context of the heavy vector triplet model with spin-1 W' and Z'
   bosons. Upper limits on the cross section are set for resonances with
   mass between 1.5 and 5.0 TeV, ranging from 6.8 to 0.53 fb for W' -> WH
   and from 8.7 to 0.53 fb for Z' -> ZH at the 95\% confidence level.}},

Abstract = {{Bacteriophages have evolved with an efficient host cell lysis mechanism
   to terminate the infection cycle and release the new progeny virions at
   the optimum time, allowing adaptation with the changing host and
   environment. Among the lytic proteins, holin controls the first and
   rate-limiting step of host cell lysis by permeabilizing the inner
   membrane at an allele-specific time known as ``holin triggering{''}.
   Pinholin S-21 is a prototype holin of phage Phi 21 which makes many
   nanoscale holes and destroys the proton motive force, which in turn
   activates the signal anchor release (SAR) endolysin system to degrade
   the peptidoglycan layer of the host cell and destruction of the outer
   membrane by the spanin complex. Like many others, phage Phi 21 has two
   holin proteins: active pinholin and antipinholin. The antipinholin form
   differs only by three extra amino acids at the N-terminus; however, it
   has a different structural topology and conformation with respect to the
   membrane. Predefined combinations of active pinholin and antipinholin
   fine-tune the lysis timing through structural dynamics and
   conformational changes. Previously, the dynamics and topology of active
   pinholin and antipinholin were investigated (Ahammad et al. JPCB 2019,
   2020) using continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (CW-EPR)
   spectroscopy. However, detailed structural studies and direct comparison
   of these two forms of pinholin S-21 are absent in the literature. In
   this study, the structural topology and conformations of active pinholin
   (S(21)68) and inactive antipinholin (S(21)68(IRS)) in DMPC
   (1,2-dimyristoyl-snglycero-3-phosphocholine) proteoliposomes were
   investigated using the four-pulse double electron-electron resonance
   (DEER) EPR spectroscopic technique to measure distances between
   transmembrane domains 1 and 2 (TMD1 and TMD2). Five sets of interlabel
   distances were measured via DEER spectroscopy for both the active and
   inactive forms of pinholin S-21. Structural models of the active
   pinholin and inactive antipinholin forms in DMPC proteoliposomes were
   obtained using the experimental DEER distances coupled with the
   simulated annealing software package Xplor-NIH. TMD2 of S(21)68 remains
   in the lipid bilayer, and TMD1 is partially externalized from the
   bilayer with some residues located on the surface. However, both TMDs

Title = {{Three-dimensional pulse response of curved composite sandwich panel with
   compressible core using non-linear higher-order theory}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SANDWICH STRUCTURES \& MATERIALS}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, the dynamic response of cylindrical sandwich panels with
   compressible core is obtained using the extended non-linear higher-order
   sandwich panel theory. It is assumed that the sandwich panel has simply
   supported boundary at all edges and is consisted of orthotropic face
   sheets and viscoelastic core layer. To describe the mechanical
   properties of the viscoelastic foam core, the Kelvin-Voigt linear
   viscoelastic model was applied. Three-dimensional linear equations of
   motions were used to describe the sandwich panel deformations. The
   effects of various parameters including the panel span, core and facing
   thickness, the viscous damping factor, pulse duration, and maximum
   pressure on the dynamic response of the sandwich cylindrical panel are
   studied. The results obtained from present method are compared with
   finite element solutions and those reported in the literature, and
   consequently, agreement among the results could be observed. The results
   shown that applied viscoelastic model has a signification effect on the
   panel response and reduces the magnitude of vibrations. The presented
   programming code (DQ) needs less computational time and computer
   hardware capacity and is faster than finite element solution.}},

   Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CASE REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{21}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Unusual or unexpected effect of treatment
   Background: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common
   neurodevelopmental disorder that manifests in early childhood.
   Pharmacotherapy, including psychostimulants, is considered the
   cornerstone of ADHD management. Although stimulants have been associated
   with adverse effects, sedation following the administration of an
   amphetamine-based stimulant is an extremely rare adverse effect.
   Case Report: We report the case of a 6-year-old boy presenting with ADHD
   and a history of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). After discussing
   treatment options with his parents, he was started on a low dose of a
   methylphenidate medication. He was unable to tolerate the medication due
   to anorexia, insomnia, and irritability despite multiple adjustments in
   the dosages. A trial of immediate-release mixed amphetamine salts was
   initiated, starting from a low dose. The boy developed sedation and
   lethargy shortly after the administration of this medication.
   Conclusions: Sedation is a rare adverse drug reaction to mixed
   amphetamine salts. Clinicians should proactively monitor for the
   possible adverse effects in patients with ASD and ADHD, including
   unexpected symptoms such as sedation. Reporting of adverse drug
   reactions should be encouraged to promote the post-marketing
   surveillance of medications.}},

Abstract = {{Formamidinium lead iodide (CH(NH2)(2)PbI3, FAPI) thin films have been
   deposited on glass substrates at 150 degrees C using ambient pressure
   aerosol assisted chemical vapour deposition (AACVD). The films have been
   analysed by a range of techniques including powder X-ray diffraction
   (pXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray
   (EDX) spectroscopy, and UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy. Sharp
   reflections in the pXRD pattern can be indexed to the alpha -phase of
   FAPI which confirms the crystallinity of the as-deposited film and
   reveals a preferred growth orientation along the (002) plane with
   respect to the substrate. High magnification SEM images show that the
   thin film is comprised of a network of intimately connected FAPI
   crystallites which form a mesoporous architecture. EDX mapping of lead
   and iodine emission peaks show that the Pb and I within these films are
   spatially co-localised. Optical measurements show as-deposited FAPI
   films have absorption onsets in the near infra-red with a direct bandgap
   value of 1.46 eV, suitable for single junction solar cells. Four-point
   probe measurement of as deposited films show that the electrical
   conductivity (sigma) of the FAPI thin film is 5.2x10(-7) S/cm, which is
   similar to FAPI thin films deposited by spin coating technique.}},

   games}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY \& PEOPLE}},
Abstract = {{Purpose This study uses a critically acclaimed digital game as an
   instructional tool to explore the role of emotional design elements on
   psychological flow and perceived learning. Design/methodology/approach
   The authors employ transportation theory to generate a set of
   antecedents of psychological flow and the theory of flow to connect the
   gaming experience to positive learning outcomes. The authors investigate
   the subjective learning experience of players with the use of a
   psychometric survey, and the authors employ structural equation
   modelling (SEM) to unearth the direct as well as the indirect effects
   amongst narrative, aesthetics, flow and learning outcomes. Findings The
   findings of this study demonstrate that narrative and aesthetics in
   serious games positively influence the perceived learning by
   facilitating a state of psychological flow. Research
   limitations/implications This study contributes to better understanding
   and theorizing the role of narrative and aesthetics on learning outcomes
   in the context of serious games. Practical implications The findings of
   this study bear valuable implications for the design of serious games as
   they highlight the importance of elements often disregarded as not
   directly related to the learning process and are typically absent from
   the design of serious games. Originality/value Prior studies have
   identified aesthetics and narratives as design elements that contribute
   to the perceived enjoyment of a game; this study empirically
   investigates the role of narratives and aesthetics in enhancing
   perceived learning through psychological flow.}},

Volume = {{84}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{In this study, effects of dietary supplementation of dried tomato powder
   (DTP) and red pepper powder (DPP) on the antioxidant mechanisms, immune
   system, cytokines, egg production performance, and egg quality were
   investigated in a total of 90, 30-week-old hens. The study groups were
   fed on a diet containing 4\% DTP and 4\% DPP, respectively for 30 days,
   while the control group received a commercial laying hen feed. Egg
   production and egg quality parameters, differential leukocyte count,
   heterophil functions, serum cytokine, malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase
   (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbic acid, and glutathione
   peroxidase (GSH-Px) levels were measured. It was determined that serum
   tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels increased (P = 0.018) and
   heterophil (P = 0.033) and monocyte (P = 0.020) percentages decreased in
   the DPP group compared to both control and DTP groups. In the same hens,
   serum transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) level (P = 0.029) and
   oxidative burst (P = 0.021) increased compared to the control group, but
   interleukin-4 (IL-4) (P = 0.014) level and SOD activity (P = 0.021)
   increased compared to the DTP group. Phagocytic activity was higher in
   the DTP group compared to other groups (P = 0.003). In addition, it was
   observed that serum catalase level (P = 0.008), and egg yolk colour (P =
   0.001) increased in both experimental groups compared to the control
   group. It was concluded that DPP and DTP used in this study strengthen
   the antioxidant defence system, increase heterophil functions, and
   positively affect cytokine production and egg colour, so it can be used
   as a safe feed additive in chickens.}},

   surface after 24 h and 72 h in SEM images. Results ACQ was found to be
   highly hydrophilic, and NT was the most hydrophobic implant. Increased
   variation of Saos-2 cell adhesion and proliferation were observed on all
   test and control groups. Controversially, at the proliferation analysis
   in 72 h, CM implant was the only implant that showed no significant
   difference between test and group (p = 0.2833; Tukey's multiple
   comparisons test). NT implants showed the greater value of cell
   proliferation when compared with all types of implant surface (p =
   0.0002; Tukey's multiple comparisons test). Conclusions These findings
   suggest that decontaminated surfaces were able to impair the counting of
   osteoblast-like cell adhesion and proliferation.}},

Title = {{Slightly and Moderately Lame Cows in Tie Stalls Behave Differently From
   Non-lame Controls. A Matched Case-Control Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{Lameness affects dairy cows worldwide and is usually associated with
   pain. Behavioral differences in lame compared to non-lame
   tie-stall-housed dairy cows might be less pronounced than in
   free-stall-housed, since the principle demands to a cow's locomotor
   system and thus the impact of lameness on behavior seem to be lower in
   tie stalls. Behavioral differences between lame and non-lame cows might
   be used to estimate the impact of lameness on the well-being of tied
   dairy cows. In the current study, lame cows were categorized as
   locomotion scoring between 2.25 and 3.25 on a 1-5 scale. The aim was to
   compare the eating, rumination and lying behavior of lame cows against
   non-lame tied dairy cows, in order to draw conclusions on the
   association of lameness, behavior and well-being in tied dairy cows. The
   eating and rumination behavior of 26, the lying behavior of 30, and the
   relative upright and lying activities of 25 matched case-control pairs
   were analyzed, considering the matching criteria farm, breed-type, and
   parity-group. Lame cows had fewer {[}mean of the pairwise differences
   (case-control) (mean(diff)) = -2.6 bouts, CI95\% (-3.8--1.4) bouts, p =
   0.001], but longer lying bouts {[}mean(diff) = 26.7 min per bout, CI95\%
   (10.1-43.4) min per bout, p = 0.006]. The lying time was shorter
   {[}mean(diff) = -64.7 min, CI95\% (-104.4--24.9) min, p = 0.006] in lame
   cows compared to their non-lame controls. Lame cows had a shorter eating
   time {[}mean(diff) = -27.7 min, CI95\% (-51.5--4.0) min, p = 0.042] and
   spent a larger proportion of their upright time ruminating {[}mean(diff)
   = 7.2\%, CI95\% (3.2-11.1)\%, p = 0.001] instead of eating. The results
   of the current study indicate that the eating, rumination, and lying
   behavior of lame tied dairy cows is altered. These findings indicate
   that slight and moderate lameness (locomotion score between 2.25 and
   3.25 on a 1-5 scale) are likely to be associated with an impaired
   well-being in affected tied dairy cows. This underlines the need to
   continuously reduce the lameness prevalence and severity in tied dairy
   herds.}},

Title = {{Important aspects of conducting an interdisciplinary public preventive
   oral health project for children in areas with low socioeconomic status:
   staff perspective}},
Journal = {{BMC ORAL HEALTH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},

Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{Background To achieve good and equal oral health in children,
   interdisciplinary preventive oral health actions, directed toward
   disadvantaged areas, can be an important means. Staff play a crucial
   role in the implementation of these actions. The aim of the present
   study was to analyze circumstances of importance for conducting an
   interdisciplinary public preventive oral health project for children,
   directed toward parents in areas with low socioeconomic status from the
   interdisciplinary perspective of the involved staff. Method The present
   study consisted of a qualitative content analysis with an inductive
   approach, based on interviews with interdisciplinary staff who had
   participated in a public preventive oral health project directed toward
   parents in areas with low socioeconomic status. The interviews were
   analyzed using text-driven analysis. Results The main category concerned
   the staff members' prerequisites and understanding necessary to perform
   their tasks in interdisciplinary public preventive oral health project.
   To have the right prerequisites and understanding regarding the oral
   health project enabled staff to be committed, able and willing to
   perform in it. Important aspects of this are to have knowledge,
   motivation and to experience a supportive professional context, to have
   good leadership and for certain resources to fulfilled. A crucial aspect
   was to reach the targeted mothers. Conclusions For interdisciplinary
   cooperation in preventive oral health care to be achieved, it is
   essential for the involved disciplines and professions to embrace a
   common view on the project's aim, their duties, and oral health, from
   the leadership to the individual level. Staff require competent
   leadership but also allocated time and adapted method support to be
   successful in this context. When allocating preventive health actions
   directed at low SES areas, it is important to acknowledge the risk of
   stigmatization and for staff to understand that families might be facing
   social challenges that prevent them from taking part in health-promoting
   actions. An important conclusion is that to be able to reach people, it
   is important for both those who design preventive programs for oral
   health and the staff who administer them to have sufficient knowledge
   about the target group.}},

Abstract = {{Arginine methylation is one of the most important post-translational
   modifications which is catalyzed by protein arginine methyltransferases
   (PRMTs). Previous studies have demonstrated that Prmt5 plays important
   role in germ cell development. Prmt7 is the only family member
   responsible for mono-methylation of arginine residue. However, whether
   Prmt7 is also involved in germ cell development remains unclear. In this
   study, we find that PRMT7 is abundantly expressed in the male germ cells
   during embryonic stage (from E10.5). Depletion of Prmt7 results in the
   defect of germ cell proliferation during embryonic stage and the number
   of primordial germ cells is significantly reduced in Prmt7(-/-) mice at
   E11.5. We also find that the size of testes is reduced in Prmt7(-/-)
   mice at P5 with reduced germ cell number and the diameter of
   seminiferous tubules. Further study reveals that the expression of BMPs
   and TGF-beta singling pathway is significantly changed in germ cells of
   Prmt7(-/-) mice at E12.5. However, no defect of testes development is
   observed in adult Prmt7(-/flox); Mvh-Cre mice. Collectively, this study
   demonstrates that Prmt7 plays roles in male germ cell proliferation
   during embryonic stages and it is not required for germ cell development
   postnatally. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Habitat Fragmentation Increases Overall Richness, but Not of
   Habitat-Dependent Species}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{Debate rages as to whether habitat fragmentation leads to the decline of
   biodiversity once habitat loss is accounted for. Previous studies have
   defined fragmentation variously, but research needs to address
   ``fragmentation per se,{''} which excludes confounding effects of
   habitat loss. Our study controls for habitat area and employs a
   mechanistic multi-species simulation to explore processes that may lead
   some species groups to be more or less sensitive to fragmentation per
   se. Our multi-land-cover, landscape-scale, individual-based model
   incorporates the movement of generic species, each with different land
   cover preferences. We investigate how fragmentation per se changes
   diversity patterns; within (alpha), between (beta) and across (gamma)
   patches of a focal-land-cover, and if this differs among species groups
   according to their specialism and dependency on this focal-land-cover.
   We defined specialism as the increased competitive ability of
   specialists in suitable habitat and decreased ability in less suitable
   land covers compared to generalist species. We found fragmentation per
   se caused an increase in gamma diversity in the focal-land-cover if we
   considered all species regardless of focal-land-cover preference.
   However, critically for conservation, the gamma diversity of species for
   whom the focal land cover is suitable habitat declined under
   fragmentation per se. An exception to this finding occurred when these
   species were specialists, who were unaffected by fragmentation per se.
   In general, focal-land-cover species were under pressure from the influx
   of other species, with fragmentation per se leading to a loss of alpha
   diversity not compensated for by increases in beta diversity and,
   therefore, gamma diversity fell. The specialist species, which were more
   competitive, were less affected by the influx of species and therefore
   alpha diversity decreased less with fragmentation per se and beta
   diversity compensated for this loss, meaning gamma diversity did not
   decrease. Our findings help to inform the fragmentation per se debate,
   showing that effects on biodiversity can be negative or positive,
   depending on species' competitive abilities and dependency on the
   fragmented land cover. Such differences in the effect of fragmentation
   per se would have important consequences for conservation. Focusing
   conservation efforts on reducing or preventing fragmentation in areas
   with species vulnerable to fragmentation.}},

Title = {{How to Facilitate Innovative Behavior and Organizational Citizenship
   Behavior: Evidence From Public Employees in Korea}},
Journal = {{PUBLIC PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT}},
Abstract = {{For decades, scholars and practitioners have paid serious attention to
   how to facilitate extra-role behaviors of employees. While many studies
   have been conducted, it is not yet clear what factors facilitate or
   suppress those behaviors within organizations and how those factors
   interact with each other. The current research focuses on two extra-role
   behaviors of employees: innovative behavior and organizational
   citizenship behavior (OCB). Both behaviors have been discussed as
   determinants of individual and organizational performance. Filling the
   gap of the existing studies, the current research comprehensively
   considers organizational characteristics, task characteristics, and
   motivational factors in explaining those behaviors. Integrating two data
   sets, the 2015 and 2016 Perception of Public Officials Surveys
   administered by the Korea Institute of Public Administration (KIPA), we
   conducted a hierarchical linear model (HLM) analysis to examine the
   effects of determinants in the Korean context. Based on the multi-level
   analysis, this research demonstrates the positive influence of autonomy
   and PSM on both behaviors. Among organizational-level variables,
   cooperative culture increases the innovative behavior, whereas the lack
   of organizational support decreases it. We provide several managerial
   implications based on the findings.}},

Abstract = {{Peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2) is upregulated in various cancers including oral
   squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). It is a known tumor promoter in some
   cancers, but its role in OSCC is unclear. This study aimed to
   investigate the effect of arecoline, an alkaloid of the betel nut, and
   human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) E6/E7 oncoproteins on induction of
   PRDX2 expression, and also the effects of PRDX2 overexpression in oral
   cell lines. Levels of PRDX2 protein were determined using western blot
   analysis of samples of exfoliated normal oral cells (n = 75) and oral
   lesion cells from OSCC cases (n = 75). Some OSCC cases were positive for
   HPV infection and some patients had a history of betel quid chewing. To
   explore the level of PRDX2 by western blot, the proteins were extracted
   from oral cell lines that were treated with arecoline or retroviruses
   containing HPV16 E6 gene and HPV16 E6/E7 expressing vector. For analysis
   of PRDX2 functions, cell proliferation, cell-cycle progression,
   apoptosis and migration was compared between oral cells overexpressing
   PRDX2 and cells with PRDX2-knockdown. PRDX2 expression levels tended to
   be higher in OSCC samples that were positive for HPV infection and had
   history of betel quid chewing. Arecoline treatment in vitro at low
   concentrations and overexpression of HPV16 E6 or E6/E7 in oral cells
   induced PRDX2 overexpression. Interestingly, in oral cells, PRDX2
   promoted cell proliferation, cell-cycle progression (G2/M phase), cell
   migration and inhibited apoptosis. Upregulation of PRDX2 in oral cells
   was induced by arecoline and HPV16 oncoproteins and promoted growth of
   OSCC cells.}},

Abstract = {{The consequences of coronavirus in favelas in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil)
   point to social inequality as a structuring factor in Brazilian society.
   The contagion spread and multiple death cases reveal the multiplicity of
   existence ways that cohabit the urban context, indicating that in many
   of these scenarios, access to decent housing, drinking water, and
   minimum income is not a reality and recommendations from international
   health agencies are challenging to implement. Against government
   technopolitics that drive different forms of death to the poorest, black
   communities, and slum dwellers, territorial insurgencies indicate other
   paths for the construction of a dignified life and access to fundamental
   rights, targeted solidarity practices, territorial political
   organization and the construction of specific public policies to deal
   with the effects of the virus which takes into account the
   particularities and distinct realities of the territory. The experiences
   of community organization around Crisis Offices in the favelas, led by
   social organizations and supporting institutions, have guaranteed (i)
   food and personal hygiene items distribution, (ii) sanitization of
   alleys, (iii) dissemination of information on the virus, and (iv)
   political articulation for disputes in defense of life preservation in
   the favelas, in opposition of genocidal processes carried out by the
   state power. Such local spaces represent practices of resistance to the
   death policies undertaken by the state policies, which most are not
   configured as spaces for collective construction and disregard
   inequalities and different needs in these territories. That way,
   community associations are presented as an inflection point, a deviation
   from the normal course of modulated subjectivities by the social
   principles and practices of neoliberalism, with the indication that the
   most efficient way to deal with social crises is through the
   strengthening of the collective and the popular organizations.}},

Abstract = {{Case studies were conducted on eight serial killers in India who were
   inmates in central prisons of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The study is a
   pioneering one on serial killers in the locale of the study. All
   available information about the lives of offenders were collected
   through multiple sources, including in-depth interviews with serial
   killers in the prisons, interviews of relatives of the killers,
   surviving victims, Investigators, crime scene studies, etc. The
   collected data have been chronologically arranged to construct
   biographies of the offenders. The rich biographies were carefully
   analyzed to construct an inclusive motivation model that can explain the
   process of individuals evolving into serial killers from a life-course
   approach. The motivation in each of the eight cases was explained with
   the proposed motivation model. The constructed motivation model is
   unique from the existing models, which were mostly rigid and, therefore,
   not applicable to cases outside the studies. The model proposes three
   critical determinants for explaining the evolution of a person into a
   serial killer, ``nature,{''} ``Deep Resting Life Factor,{''} and ``key
   Incidents.{''} The study found a relatively short incident named
   ``trigger{''} in the lives of six serial killers, which played a
   significant role in bringing out the dormant killer instinct and push
   the subjects toward the first murder. The comparative analysis of the
   motivation in different cases revealed that though there were recurring
   factors in the lives of serial killers, their interactions were more
   important than standalone factors. The study also found that there are
   no predetermined recipes for the making of a killer like some past
   researchers claimed.}},

Title = {{Exploring diverse sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) accessions for

Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{127}},

Abstract = {{Sorghum is a climate resilient grain cereal crop originating from Africa
   that has traditionally been used to make a variety of fermented
   beverages such as pito and baijiu. In Western markets, the use of
   sorghum to produce beers and beverages has recently risen due to the
   visibility of a gluten sensitive/intolerant market and a growing
   interest in unique inputs for beverage production. As such, there is a
   developing body of research on sorghum as a malted input into beverages.
   A major limitation to the wider adoption of sorghum as a substrate in
   mashing is its low activity of amylolytic enzymes, either the result of
   insufficient activity or inhibition by endogenous compounds. A
   collection of 42 diverse accessions representing the grain sorghum
   diversity panel, was evaluated for associations between alpha and beta
   amylase content, race, origin, and seed colour as well as two classes of
   amylase inhibitors, phenols and tannins. Among these accessions are
   several commonly used genetic resources, including reference line
   BTx623. Notable findings include accessions with high alpha amylase
   content, sources that may harbour additional high amylase sorghums,
   associations with grain colour, and populations which may be used to
   genetically map the trait. (c) 2020 The Authors. Journal of the

Journal = {{ENERGY \& FUELS}},

Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{15782-15801}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{A comprehensive investigation of the effect of initial cooling
   temperature on the structural behaviors of gelled waxy crude oil is
   conducted, including the ``temperature-dependent viscoelasticity
   behaviors{''}, ``time-dependent viscoelasticity behaviors{''},
   ``time-dependent deformation behaviors{''}, ``structural decomposition
   behaviors{''}, ``thixotropic behavior{''}, and ``microstructure
   manifestation{''}. Two different structural behaviors are exhibited with
   contrary rigid and brittle structural characters, structural
   regeneration performances, and cooling rate and oscillation frequency
   responses. The strongest elastic-dominated viscoelasticity and
   thixotropic behaviors occur at the initial cooling temperature near wax
   dissolution temperature (WDT). With increasing initial cooling
   temperature, a noticeable decrease in viscoelasticity and thixotropic
   behavior results in the clustering of opposite structural behaviors.
   With decreasing initial cooling temperature below WDT, although the
   structural behavior can be clustered with that at the initial cooling
   temperature near WDT, the gradual decreasing viscoelasticity behavior is
   presented. The direct microscopic evidence on the rheological
   deterioration and improvement are provided by two microscopic
   observation methods. Meanwhile, two different kinds of wax crystals with
   contrary influences on rheological behaviors are observed at initial
   cooling temperatures lower than the WDT. Furthermore, a hypothesis is
   proposed to explain the influence mechanism of initial cooling
   temperature lower than the WDT on the structural behaviors of waxy crude
   oil. In addition, different motion behaviors and mechanical performances
   of wax crystals are exhibited in response to the external load and
   impact, which further characterizes the intrinsic differences of inner
   structures of waxy crude oil formed at different initial cooling
   temperatures.}},

Journal = {{BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{Background In the Twin Birth Study, women at 32(0/7)-38(6/7) weeks of
   gestation, in whom the first twin was in cephalic presentation, were
   randomized to planned vaginal delivery or cesarean section. The study
   found no significant differences in neonatal or maternal outcomes in the
   two planned mode of delivery groups. We aimed to compare neonatal and
   maternal outcomes of twin gestations without spontaneous onset of labor,
   who underwent induction of labor or pre-labor cesarean section as the
   intervention of induction may affect outcomes. Methods In this secondary
   analysis of the Twin Birth Study we compared those who had an induction
   of labor with those who had a pre-labor cesarean section. The primary
   outcome was a composite of fetal or neonatal death or serious neonatal
   morbidity. Secondary outcome was a composite of maternal morbidity and
   mortality. Trial Registration: NCT00187369. Results Of the 2804 women
   included in the Twin Birth Study, a total of 1347 (48\%) women required
   a delivery before a spontaneous onset of labor occurred: 568 (42\%) in
   the planned vaginal delivery arm and 779 (58\%) in the planned cesarean
   arm. Induction of labor was attempted in 409 (30\%), and 938 (70\%) had
   a pre-labor cesarean section. The rate of intrapartum cesarean section
   in the induction of labor group was 41.3\%. The rate of the primary
   outcome was comparable between the pre-labor cesarean section group and
   induction of labor group (1.65\% vs. 1.97\%; p = 0.61; OR 0.83; 95\% CI
   0.43-1.62). The maternal composite outcome was found to be lower with
   pre-labor cesarean section compared to induction of labor (7.25\% vs.
   11.25\%; p = 0.01; OR 0.61; 95\% CI 0.41-0.91). Conclusion In women with
   twin gestation between 32(0/7)-38(6/7) weeks of gestation, induction of
   labor and pre-labor cesarean section have similar neonatal outcomes.
   Pre-labor cesarean section is associated with favorable maternal
   outcomes which differs from the overall Twin Birth Study results. These
   data may be used to better counsel women with twin gestation who are
   faced with the decision of interventional delivery.}},

   interaction between two impurities is strongly attractive at short
   distance and oscillates in space for larger distances. We theoretically
   investigate the scattering properties and compute the scattering phase
   shifts and scattering lengths between two heavy impurities in an ideal
   Fermi gas at zero temperature. While the induced interaction between
   impurities is weakly attractive for weak impurity-medium interactions,
   we find that impurities strongly and attractively interacting with the
   medium exhibit resonances in the induced scattering with a sign change
   of the induced scattering length and even strong repulsion. These
   resonances occur whenever a three-body Efimov bound state appears at the
   continuum threshold. At energies above the continuum threshold, we find
   that the Efimov state in medium can turn into a quasibound state with a
   finite decay width.}},

Abstract = {{Two equilibrium FCC catalysts of the octane-barrel (ECAT-D) and resid
   (ECAT-R) types were used in the cracking of a typical vacuum gasoil
   (VGO) and its saturated (SF), aromatic (AF), and resin (RF) fractions.
   The experiments were carried out in a batch, fluidized bed laboratory
   CREC Riser Simulator reactor. The reaction temperature was 500 degrees
   C, the catalyst-to-oil relationship was 1, with 0.2 g of the catalyst
   being used in each experiment, and the reaction times were 0.7, 1.5, and
   3 s. The ranking of the reactivities of the different feedstocks was SF
   > VGO > AF > RF over both catalysts. While the AF and RF fractions
   yielded more gasoline than the SF fraction, the latter showed the
   highest yields of LPG. The coke forming trend followed the order SF <
   VGO < AF < RF. Even though catalyst ECAT-D, with a higher and stronger
   acidity, was more active than catalyst ECAT-R, which has less acidity
   and better textural properties (higher mesoporosity and pore diameter),
   the latter was less affected by coke deposition, considering the changes
   in the specific surface area and acidic properties after use. Coke
   impacted more severely on Bronsted acid sites than on Lewis sites,
   particularly when the AF and RF fractions were used. The stronger acid
   sites were more severely affected by coke, particularly in catalyst
   ECAT-D. The negative effect on strong acidic sites was consistent with
   the increasing basic character of the feedstocks, following the order SF
   < VGO < AF<RF.}},

Title = {{Current treatment standard for patella fractures in Germany}},
Journal = {{UNFALLCHIRURG}},
Abstract = {{Background The treatment of patella fractures is technically demanding.
   Although the radiological results are mostly satisfactory, this often
   does not correspond to the subjective assessment of the patients. The
   classical treatment with tension band wiring with K-wires has several
   complications. Fixed-angle plate osteosynthesis seems to be
   biomechanically advantageous. Objective Who is treating patella
   fractures in Germany? What is the current standard of treatment? Have
   modern forms of osteosynthesis become established? What are the most
   important complications? Material and methods The members of the German
   Society for Orthopedics and Trauma Surgery and the German Knee Society
   were asked to participate in an online survey. Results A total of 511
   completed questionnaires were evaluated. Most of the respondents are
   specialized in trauma surgery (51.5\%), have many years of professional
   experience and work in trauma centers. Of the surgeons 50\% treat <= 5
   patella fractures annually. In almost 40\% of the cases preoperative
   imaging is supplemented by computed tomography. The classical tension
   band wiring with K-wires is still the preferred form of osteosynthesis
   for all types of fractures (transverse fractures 52\%, comminuted
   fractures 40\%). In the case of comminuted fractures 30\% of the
   surgeons choose fixed-angle plate osteosynthesis. If the inferior pole
   is involved a McLaughlin cerclage is used for additional protection in
   60\% of the cases. Discussion The standard of care for patella fractures
   in Germany largely corresponds to the updated S2e guidelines. Tension
   band wiring is still the treatment of choice. Further (long-term)
   clinical studies are needed to verify the advantages of fixed-angle
   plates.}},

Abstract = {{Landscape change is a key driver of biodiversity declines due to habitat
   loss and fragmentation, but spatially shifting resources can also
   facilitate range expansion and invasion. Invasive populations are
   reproductively successful, and landscape change may buoy this success.
   We show how modeling the spatial structure of reproductive success can
   elucidate the mechanisms of range shifts and sustained invasions for
   mammalian species with attendant young. We use an example of
   white-tailed deer (deer; Odocoileus virginianus) expansion in the
   Nearctic boreal forest, a North American phenomenon implicated in severe
   declines of threatened woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus).
   We hypothesized that deer reproductive success is linked to forage
   subsidies provided by extensive landscape change via resource
   extraction. We measured deer occurrence using data from 62 camera traps
   in northern Alberta, Canada, over three years. We weighed support for
   multiple competing hypotheses about deer reproductive success using
   multistate occupancy models and generalized linear models in an
   AIC-based model selection framework.
   Spatial patterns of reproductive success were best explained by features
   associated with petroleum exploration and extraction, which offer
   early-seral vegetation resource subsidies. Effect sizes of anthropogenic
   features eclipsed natural heterogeneity by two orders of magnitude. We
   conclude that anthropogenic early-seral forage subsidies support high
   springtime reproductive success, mitigating or exceeding winter losses,
   maintaining populations.
   Synthesis and Applications. Modeling spatial structuring in reproductive
   success can become a key goal of remote camera-based global networks,
   yielding ecological insights into mechanisms of invasion and range
   shifts to inform effective decision-making for global biodiversity
   conservation.}},

Title = {{Serum Metabolomic Profiling in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients With
   Interstitial Lung Disease: A Case-Control Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is an extra-articular
   manifestation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), detected in 10.7\% of
   patients, and causing a poor prognosis. Hence, biomarkers for ILD are
   urgently required in RA. Low molecular weight metabolites can be
   assessed by metabolomic analyses, and although these have been conducted
   in RA and in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, few have been carried out
   for ILD in the context of RA. Therefore, we analyzed serum metabolomic
   profiles of ILD in RA to identify novel biomarkers.
   Methods: Serum samples from 100 RA patients with ILD and 100 matched RA
   patients without chronic lung disease (CLD) were collected. These
   samples were subjected to metabolomic analyses using capillary
   electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
   Results: A total of 299 metabolites were detected in the metabolomic
   analysis. By univariate analysis, serum levels of decanoic acid and
   morpholine were lower in RA with ILD (false discovery rate Q = 1.87 x
   10(-11) and 7.09 x 10(-6), respectively), and glycerol was higher (Q =
   1.20 x 10(-6)), relative to RA without CLD. Serum levels of these
   metabolites in RA with usual interstitial pneumonia or RA with
   non-specific interstitial pneumonia were also altered. The partial least
   squares-discriminant analysis model generated from these three
   metabolites could successfully discriminate ILD in RA (area under the
   curve: 0.919, 95\% confidence interval: 0.867-0.968, sensitivity 0.880,
   specificity 0.780).
   Conclusions: Serum levels of some metabolites were significantly
   different in RA with ILD compared with RA without CLD. It is concluded
   that metabolomic profiling will be useful for discovering candidate
   screening biomarkers for ILD in RA.}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneity is a significant feature of many mature oilfields after
   polymer flooding, which presents great challenges for further enhanced
   oil recovery (EOR). The displacing fluid after polymer flooding should
   have the dual effects of improving the swept volume and increasing oil
   displacement efficiency. At present, alkali-surfactant-polymer (ASP)
   flooding is an important approach for further EOR after polymer flooding
   in the Daqing Oilfield. Preformed particle gel (PPG) is a new type of
   chemical agent with a powerful ability to deform and pass through the
   pore throat. Here, a series of experiments were carried out to
   investigate the profile control of PPG/ASP mixed solutions in
   heterogeneous reservoirs. The results show that, with respect to profile
   adjustment and EOR after polymer flooding, PPG/ASP mixed solutions are
   better than ASP-only solutions. Regarding PPG/ASP mixed solutions, PPG
   and hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) could block the reservoir
   preferential fluid flow pathways via their properties of easy
   deformation and high viscosity in order to achieve the purpose of
   improving the swept volume; at the same time, Na2CO3 and petroleum
   sulfonate could reduce oil-water interfacial tension so as to increase
   oil displacement efficiency. Besides, compared with ASP-only solutions,
   PPG/ASP mixed solutions have greater resistance and residual resistance
   coefficients, higher viscosity, and better flow control stability. Oil
   recovery enhanced by using PPG/ASP mixed solutions after polymer
   flooding boasts 3.4\% more original oil in place (OOIP) when compared to
   ASP-only solutions, and the consumption of chemical agents is reduced by
   15.8\%. Furthermore, the proportion and characteristics of microscopic
   residual oil distribution after different flooding systems were
   investigated. The results are consistent with the core flooding
   experiment and confirm that when combined, PPG and ASP have a
   synergistic effect on profile control after polymer flooding in
   heterogeneous reservoirs.}},

   TRUPCR SARS-CoV-2 Kit (Black Bio), (2) TaqPath RT-PCR COVID-19 Kit
   (Thermo Fisher Scientific), (3) Allplex 2019-nCOV Assay (Seegene), (4)
   Patho detect COVID-19 PCR kit (My Lab), (5) LabGun COVID-19 RT-PCR Kit
   (Lab Genomics, Korea), (6) Fosun COVID-19 RT-PCR detection kit (Fosun
   Ltd.), (7) Real-time Fluorescent RT-PCR kit for SARS CoV-2 (BGI) was
   evaluated on precharacterised 40 positive and 10 negative COVID-19
   sample pools. All seven kits detected all sample pools with low C-t
   values (<30); while testing weak positive pooled samples with high C-t
   value (>30); the TRUPCR Kit, TaqPath Kit, Allplex Assay, and BGI RT-PCR
   kit showed 100\% sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. However, the
   Fosun kit, LabGun Kit, and Patho detect kit could detect only 90\%,
   85\%, and 75\% of weakly positive samples, respectively. We conclude
   that all seven commercially available RT-PCR kits included in this study
   can be used for routine molecular diagnosis of COVID-19. However,
   regarding performing pooled sample testing, it might be advisable to use
   those kits that performed best regarding positive identification in
   samples' pool, that is TRUPCR SARS-CoV-2 Kit, TaqPath RT-PCR COVID-19
   Kit, Allplex 2019-nCOV Assay, and BGI Real-time RT-PCR kit for detecting
   SARS CoV-2.}},

Abstract = {{The Satellite Information Familiarization Tool (SIFT) is an open-source,
   multi-platform graphical user interface designed to easily display
   spectral and temporal sequences of geostationary satellite imagery. The
   Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) and Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) on the
   ``new generation{''} of geostationary satellites collect imagery with a
   spatial resolution four times greater than previously available.
   Combined with the increased number of spectral bands and more frequent
   imaging, the new series imagers collect approximately 60 times more
   data. Given the resulting large file sizes, the development of SIFT is a
   multi-year effort to make those satellite imagery data files accessible
   to the broad community of students, scientists, and operational
   meteorologists. To achieve the objective of releasing software that
   provides an intuitive user experience to complement optimum performance
   on consumer-grade computers, SIFT was built to leverage modern graphics
   processing units (GPUs) through existing open-source Python packages,
   and runs on the three major operating systems: Windows, Mac, and Linux.
   The United States National Weather Service funded the development of
   SIFT to help enhance the satellite meteorology acumen of their
   operational meteorologists. SIFT has basic image visualization
   capabilities and enables the fluid animation and interrogation of
   satellite images, creation of Red-Green-Blue (RGB) composites and
   algebraic combinations of multiple spectral bands, and comparison of
   imagery with numerical weather prediction output. Open for community
   development, SIFT users and features continue to grow. SIFT is freely
   available with short tutorials and a user guide online. The mandate for
   the software, its development, realized applications, and envisioned
   role in science and training are explained.}},

Title = {{Emotional Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown Among the Spanish Population}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{Background The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in some populations being
   confined to their homes as part of infection control measures. This
   situation can be hard to cope with due to separation from loved ones,
   prohibition of regular activities, fear of infection, loss of freedom,
   and so on. These negative impacts cause considerable psychological
   stress, and all the more so when the situation continues for an extended
   period, as was the case in Spain. The present study was aimed at
   investigating the effects of COVID-19 quarantine on the emotional
   functioning of confined Spanish individuals after 8 weeks of lockdown by
   means of a cross-sectional study. The possible associations between
   changes in emotional functioning and demographic variables (age and
   sex), health habits (physical exercise, following a routine, and
   smoking), social support, and resilience were also analyzed. Methods A
   total of 906 Spanish adults completed an online survey to gather
   information about their prevailing mood and affects (before and after 8
   weeks of lockdown), using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule
   (PANAS) (Watson et al., 1988), and other variables related to their
   habits and protective factors. Findings As expected, the data indicated
   an increase in negative affects (e.g., ``upset,{''} ``afraid,{''}
   ``distressed{''}) and a decrease in positive affects after 8 weeks under
   lockdown, as well as a general decline in overall mood. The largest
   increases in negative affects were observed in young adults (18-35
   years) and women. We did not find any differences between people who
   were or were not diagnosed with COVID-19. Adhering to a routine,
   maintaining the same weight, and moderate physical exercise were
   associated with fewer negative affects, which indicates they are
   important protective factors, as are perceived social support and
   resilience. Conclusion In order to mitigate the psychological impact of
   confinement, it is important to develop psychoeducational measures that
   encourage subjects to adhere to health habits and promote social support
   and resilience as protective factors. A special preventive focus should
   be placed on the most vulnerable population groups, namely women and
   young adults. For a public health lockdown to succeed, its negative
   consequences must be minimized insofar as possible through adequate
   knowledge of the risk factors and protective factors, and by means of
   prevention-oriented organization.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) is associated with cardiovascular
   morbidity in adults and children. NF kappa B activity is enhanced in
   circulating monocytes of adults with OSA, that decreases following
   positive pressure therapy. OSA children's serum activates NF kappa B in
   a cell line. We hypothesized that OSA children's serum can activate NF
   kappa B in cardiomyocytes (CM) and effect their viability. In order to
   explore the role played by NF kappa B in OSA cardiovascular
   pathophysiology, rat, mouse and human immortalized CM were exposed to
   human serum drawn from OSA children and matched controls. Increased
   expression of NF kappa B classical subunits p65/p50 as well as major
   morphological changes occurred in cardiomyocytes following OSA's serum
   exposure. OSA children's serum induced NF kappa B activity as measured
   by p65 nuclear translocation in immortalized human CM and rat
   cardiomyocytes as well as dense immunostaining of the nucleus. Trypan
   blue and XTT assays showed that OSA sera induced CM apoptosis. We
   conclude that NF kappa B is systemically activated in cardiomyocytes,
   who also demonstrate decreased viability and contractility following
   exposure to OSA serum. It supports the hypothesis NF kappa B plays a
   role in the evolution of cardiovascular morbidity in OSA. It may support
   the search for new therapeutic interventions controlling NF kappa B
   activation in OSA.}},

Journal = {{ESC HEART FAILURE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{8}},

Pages = {{139-150}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Aims Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is
   associated with reduced exercise capacity elicited by skeletal muscle
   (SM) alterations. Up to now, no clear medical treatment advice for HFpEF
   is available. Identification of the ideal animal model mimicking the
   human condition is a critical step in developing and testing treatment
   strategies. Several HFpEF animals have been described, but the most
   suitable in terms of comparability with SM alterations in HFpEF patients
   is unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate molecular
   changes in SM of three different animal models and to compare them with
   alterations of muscle biopsies obtained from human HFpEF patients.
   Methods and results Skeletal muscle tissue was obtained from HFpEF and
   control patients and from three different animal models including the
   respective controls-ZSF1 rat, Dahl salt-sensitive rat, and transverse
   aortic constriction surgery/deoxycorticosterone mouse. The development
   of HFpEF was verified by echocardiography. Protein expression and enzyme
   activity of selected markers were assessed in SM tissue homogenates.
   Protein expression between SM tissue obtained from HFpEF patients and
   the ZSF1 rats revealed similarities for protein markers involved in
   muscle atrophy (MuRF1 expression, protein ubiquitinylation, and LC3) and
   mitochondrial metabolism (succinate dehydrogenase and malate
   dehydrogenase activity, porin expression). The other two animal models
   exhibited far less similarities to the human samples.
   Conclusions None of the three tested animal models mimics the condition
   in HFpEF patients completely, but among the animal models tested, the
   ZSF1 rat (ZSF1-lean vs. ZSF1-obese) shows the highest overlap to the
   human condition. Therefore, when studying therapeutic interventions to
   treat HFpEF and especially alterations in the SM, we suggest that the
   ZSF1 rat is a suitable model.}},

   economic consequences. Evidence-informed conservation actions are
   essential to prevent potential cascading consequences of insect
   declines, and to help declining populations recover. Policy-makers rely
   on syntheses of primary research, such as reviews and meta-analyses,
   when making decisions about which conservation actions to implement.
   These evidence reviews vary in their quality, and do not necessarily
   synthesise the full range of scientific evidence found in the primary
   literature, which hampers decision-making. This evidence review map will
   identify, catalogue, and describe evidence reviews that investigate
   actions and policies to conserve insect biodiversity. This will help
   policy makers identify relevant reviews and researchers to identify
   synthesis gaps. It will also generate a list of conservation actions
   which can feed into future synthesis projects. We will produce an
   interactive database of evidence reviews, acting as a bibliography for
   policy-makers, curate a list of insect conservation actions that have
   been reviewed, and identify synthesis gaps for conservation actions that
   have not been reviewed.
   Methods: We will search for evidence reviews across seven large, generic
   bibliographic databases, a database of environmental reviews, and five
   grey literature resources using a search string consisting of an insect
   substring, a biodiversity or population response substring, an evidence
   synthesis substring, and a conservation substring. The results will be
   deduplicated and then screened at title and abstract (concurrently) and
   full text levels against predefined inclusion criteria. We will
   initially perform consistency checking on a subset of records at each
   level to ensure the inclusion criteria are sufficiently clear and
   understood by multiple reviewers. We will extract a suite of descriptive
   meta-data from relevant reviews, including a description of the action
   and information on each review's focal taxa, biomes, and locations. If
   resources allow, we will apply the CEESAT critical appraisal tool for
   evidence reviews to assess validity of individual records and the
   evidence base as a whole. We will summarise our findings in an
   interactive database of reviews and other visualisations, including
   evidence atlases and heat maps (cross tabulations of the volume of
   evidence across two categorical variables). The findings of the evidence
   review map will support the identification of synthesis gaps and
   clusters that may warrant further attention through secondary research.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, the only therapeutic choice for the treatment of
   triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is chemotherapy. In TNBC, despite
   strong preclinical data, clinical trials of molecular targeted drugs,
   such as the Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib, have failed because
   of the heterogeneity of TNBC cells. Here, we examined the mechanism of
   intrinsic resistance to dasatinib in five TNBC cell lines. First, we
   divided the TNBC cell lines into those sensitive or resistant to
   dasatinib and found that activation of Src was inhibited in all of the
   cell lines. In contrast, we found that dasatinib inhibited Akt
   phosphorylation in only the dasatinib-sensitive cell lines.
   Consequently, we found that combination treatment with dasatinib and an
   inhibitor of Akt or mTOR suppressed cell proliferation more than did
   either monotherapy in the dasatinib-resistant cell lines. Finally, to
   mimic intrinsic resistance, we established a dasatinib-tolerant TNBC
   cell line. In this cell line, the combinational effect of Akt/mTOR
   inhibition with dasatinib was observed, as it was in the cell lines with
   intrinsic resistance. Together, the present results show that the effect
   of dasatinib in TNBC is independent of Src inhibition, and that Akt/mTOR
   inhibition might be an effective strategy to overcome TNBC cells with
   intrinsic dasatinib resistance. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by

Title = {{Effects on Gambling Activity From Coronavirus Disease 2019-An Analysis
   of Revenue-Based Taxation of Online- and Land-Based Gambling Operators
   During the Pandemic}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: Concerns have been raised about increased gambling problems
   during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis, particularly in
   settings with high online gambling and risks of migration from
   land-based to riskier online-based gambling types. However, few
   non-self-reported data sources are hitherto available. The present study
   aimed to assess changes in the online- and land-based gambling markets
   in Sweden during the first months affected by the societal impact of
   COVID-19.
   Methods: Data were derived from national authority data describing
   monthly taxations of all licensed Swedish gambling operators, whose
   monthly tax payments are directly based on gambling revenue.
   Subdivisions of the gambling market were followed monthly from before
   COVID-19 onset in Sweden (mainly February 2020) through June 2020, when
   the sports market was restarted after COVID-19 lockdown.
   Results: Overall revenue-based taxations in the licensed gambling
   decreased markedly from February to March, but stabilized onto an
   overall modest decrease through June. Commercial online casino/betting,
   despite some decrease in March, was maintained on a relatively stable
   level through June. However, within this category, horse betting
   increased steeply during the pandemic but returned to prepandemic levels
   later during the period. The state-owned operator in betting/online
   casino decreased markedly throughout the pandemic. The remaining
   commercial operators, mainly in online casino and online betting,
   demonstrated no change during the pandemic and ended on a June level
   14\% above the February level. Throughout the pandemic, the smaller
   restaurant casinos decreased markedly, while major state-owned casinos
   also closed entirely. State-owned lotteries and electronic gambling
   machines decreased markedly but were rapidly normalized to prepandemic
   levels.
   Conclusions: Commercial online gambling operators' revenues remained
   stable throughout the pandemic, despite the dramatic lockdown in sports.
   Thus, chance-based online games may have remained a strong actor in the
   gambling market despite the COVID-19 crisis, in line with previous
   self-report data. A sudden increase in horse betting during the sports
   lockdown and its decrease when sports reopened confirm the picture of
   possible COVID-19-related migration between gambling types, indicating a
   volatility with potential impact on gambling-related public health.}},

   traditional and Alternative Model of Personality Disorders (AMPD)
   diagnostic criteria for OCPD, as well as other individual AMPD
   personality traits deemed conceptually relevant to the FFOCI. The
   results were generally quite supportive of construct validity. They
   showed that FFOCI scale scores converged with traditional measures of
   OCPD and AMPD-OCPD traits and impairment in a conceptually expected
   manner, with a few exceptions. Overall, it was clear from these findings

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates how secondary electron energy spectroscopy
   (SEES) performed inside a scanning electron microscope (SEM) can be used
   to map sample atomic number and acquire bulk valence band density of

   experimental and theoretical bulk valance band DOS distributions was
   obtained for six different test samples, where the normalised root mean
   square deviation ranged from 2.7 to 6.7\%. High accuracy levels of this
   kind do not appear to have been reported before. The results presented

Abstract = {{Vegetation has successfully been used for remediation of
   heavy-metal-contaminated soils (phytoremediation). The heavy-metal-rich
   biomass after phytoremediation can be processed by pyrolysis, achieving
   bioenergy production and pollutant control. The pretreatment of the
   heavy-metal-rich biomass prior to pyrolysis, as an emerging factor,
   needs to be investigated. For this purpose, heavy-metal-rich biomass
   obtained from phytoremediation was engineered by impregnating with four
   phosphates (KH2PO4, K2HPO4, NaH2PO4, and Na2HPO4) prior to pyrolysis in
   the temperature range of 300-700 degrees C. The untreated (control) and
   water-wash-treated biomass were employed as references. Results showed
   that impregnated K2HPO4 and Na2HPO4 catalyzed the pyrolysis process,
   reducing the temperature for the highest mass loss rate from 343 degrees
   C in the control to similar to 306 degrees C. The heavy metals enriched
   in the control also catalyzed the pyrolysis process. The bio-oils
   produced from the phosphate pretreatments contained a higher proportion
   of phenolic compounds while lower ketones compared to the control.
   Notably, upon the phosphate pretreatment, the heavy metal recoveries in
   the biochars at 500 degrees C were significantly increased, with more
   than 80\% of As and more than 90\% of Pb and Zn sequestrated in the
   solid products. This study showed that the application of phosphates as
   the pretreatment method catalyzed the pyrolysis of the heavy-metal-rich
   biomass, enhanced the heavy metal recovery in biochars, and thus
   provided a safe and value-added way to the phytoremediation-pyrolysis
   scheme.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed the inter-visit repeatability of 15x9-mm(2) swept-source
   OCTA (SS-OCTA; PLEX Elite 9000, Carl Zeiss Meditec) metrics in 14
   healthy participants. We analysed the perfusion density (PD) of large
   vessels, superficial capillary plexus (SCP), and deep capillary plexus
   (DCP) as well as choriocapillaris flow voids in 2 different regions: the
   macular region and peripheral region. Also, retinal plexus metrics were
   processed further using different filters (Hessian, Gabor and Bayesian)
   while choriocapillaris flow voids were calculated with 1 and 1.25
   standard deviation (SD) thresholding algorithms. We found excellent
   repeatability in the perfusion densities of large vessels (ICC>0.96).
   Perfusion densities varied with different filters in the macular region
   (SCP: 24.12-38.57\% and DCP: 25.16-38.50\%) and peripheral (SCP:
   30.52-39.84\% and DCP: 34.19-41.60\%) regions. The ICCs were lower in
   the macular region compared to the peripheral region and lower for DCP
   than for SCP. For choriocapillaris flow voids, the 1.25 SD threshold
   resulted in fewer flow voids, while a good ICC (ICC>0.81) was achieved
   using either threshold settings for flow void features in both regions.
   Our results suggest good repeatability of widefield SS-OCTA for the
   measurements of retinal perfusion density and choriocapillaris flow
   voids, but measurements from different filters should not be
   interchanged.}},

Title = {{Using Sequence Analysis to Determine the Well-Functioning of Small
   Groups in Large Online Courses}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN EDUCATION}},
Abstract = {{Collaborative learning in small groups can enrich and enhance the
   learning experience in large online courses by facilitating interaction
   and collaborative knowledge building between peers. on the work reported
   here addresses scenarios based on asynchronous communication and
   exchange. As compared to synchronous and face-to-face settings, these
   scenarios require higher explicit coordination efforts and specific
   support mechanisms to reach out to inactive group members. This can be
   achieved by human tutors as well as through automatic interventions by
   the system in the organization and facilitation of group work. Our
   approach is based on characterizing the quality or well-functioning of
   collaboration using sequence alignment techniques that were originally
   developed in bioinformatics for the comparison of DNA sequences.
   Sequence alignment provides a similarity measure between pairs of action
   logs originating from the group work. The ensuing similarity matrix
   allows for clustering the working groups characterized by the similarity
   of their complete action logs. Notably, these clusters differ clearly in
   terms of quality measures related to the activity distribution and group
   output. This allows for determining quality indicators that can trigger
   feedback and adaptive scaffolding. Our data stem from inter-university
   online courses in which regular (weekly or bi-weekly) assignments had to
   be completed in small groups supported by an online forum for
   coordination and a separate tool for the actual collaborative writing.
   The basic actions are interpreted/coded as different contribution types,
   namely coordination, monitoring, minor/major contributions. Longer
   periods of inactivity are coded as another type of action ({''}gap{''}).
   These are the building blocks for the sequence alignment. One
   consequence of our analysis is a revision of the intuitive assumption
   that inactivity is a main indicator of inefficient group work: We found
   that inactivity can be compensated by early coordination to the extent
   that coordination is even the most important factor for successful group
   work. These insights are now being used to design alert mechanisms to
   signal inefficient group work and to generate timely interventions.}},

Journal = {{BMC PLANT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundUlmus lamellosa (one of the ancient species of Ulmus) is an
   endemic and endangered plant that has undergone climatic oscillations
   and geographical changes. The elucidation of its demographic history and
   genetic differentiation is critical for understanding the evolutionary
   process and ecological adaption to forests in Northern
   China.ResultsPolymorphic haplotypes were detected in most populations of
   U. lamellosa via DNA sequencing. All haplotypes were divided into three
   phylogeographic clades fundamentally corresponding to their geographical
   distribution, namely THM (Taihang Mountains), YM (Yinshan Mountains),
   and YSM (Yanshan Mountains) groups. The YSM group, which is regarded as
   ancestral, possessed higher genetic diversity and significant genetic
   variability in contrast to the YSM and YM groups. Meanwhile, the
   divergence time of intraspecies haplotypes occurred during the
   Miocene-Pliocene, which was associated with major Tertiary geological
   and/or climatic events. Different degrees of gene exchanges were
   identified between the three groups. During glaciation, the YSM and THM
   regions might have served as refugia for U. lamellosa. Based on ITS
   data, range expansion was not expected through evolutionary processes,
   except for the THM group. A series of mountain uplifts (e.g., Yanshan
   Mountains and Taihang Mountains) following the Miocene-Pliocene, and
   subsequently quaternary climatic oscillations in Northern China, further
   promoted divergence between U. lamellosa
   populations.ConclusionsGeographical topology and climate change in
   Northern China played a critical role in establishing the current
   phylogeographic structural patterns of U. lamellosa. These results
   provide important data and clues that facilitate the demographic study
   of tree species in Northern China.}},

Abstract = {{Background To investigate the risk of treatment-resistant depression
   (TRD) in patients with depression by examining their clinical features,
   early prescription patterns, and early and lifetime comorbidities.
   Methods In total, 31,422 depressive inpatients were followed-up from
   diagnostic onset for more than 10-years. Patients were diagnosed with
   TRD if their antidepressant treatment regimen was altered >= two times
   or if they were admitted after at least two different antidepressant
   treatments. Multiple Cox regression model were used to determine whether
   physical and psychiatric comorbidities, psychosis, and prescription
   patterns increased the risk of TRD by controlling for relevant
   demographic covariates. Survival analyses were performed for important
   TRD-associated clinical variables. Results Females with depression
   (21.24\%) were more likely to suffer from TRD than males (14.02\%).
   Early anxiety disorders were more commonly observed in the TRD group
   than in the non-TRD group (81.48 vs. 58.96\%, p < 0.0001). Lifetime
   anxiety disorders had the highest population attributable fraction
   (42.87\%). Seventy percent of patients with multiple psychiatric
   comorbidities developed TRD during follow-up. Cox regression analysis
   further identified that functional gastrointestinal disorders
   significantly increased TRD risk (aHR = 1.19). Higher doses of
   antidepressants and benzodiazepines and Z drugs in the early course of
   major depressive disorder increased TRD risk (p < 0.0001). Conclusion
   Our findings indicate the need to monitor early comorbidities and
   polypharmacy patterns in patients with depression associated with
   elevated TRD risk.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WORK}},
Abstract = {{Aim
   Social workers are often called to intervene in situations that are
   difficult to solve because of their complexity. The article proposes a
   theoretical framework grounded in complexity and chaos theories that
   explores the structure and non-linear causality of complex systems,
   their complex and non-linear dynamics and different conditions leading
   to adjustment, adaptation and learning.
   Findings
   While examples inspired by practice and research findings with families
   and various professionals are used to illustrate complex situations, the
   article rather presents different notions related to this theoretical
   framework.
   Applications
   Some implications for practice and education are explored as a way to
   encourage discussions with regards to the value of a theoretical
   framework based on complexity for social work professionals.}},

   the inventory is also normative because - as I shall argue in this paper
   - the schemes identified in the sample are presumptive arguments
   schemes. They are therefore schemes with a claim to rationality,
   provided that certain conditions are met. The schemes included in the
   inventory are: the scheme of instrumental argumentation, the scheme from
   unintended consequences, the scheme from values, the schemes from model

Abstract = {{Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a worldwide tick-borne viral
   infection in humans. The aim of the study is to report a case of a
   female patient with severe CCHF with the bacteremia of Clostridium
   perfringens. An 18-year-old woman admitted to the emergency department
   with sudden onset of fever, nausea and vomiting, myalgia, headache,
   generalized abdominal pain. It was learned that the patient was living
   in a rural area and had a history of tick bite 3 days before the
   admission. At laboratory examination, bicytopenia, abnormal liver
   function tests, and abnormal coagulation parameters were observed. The
   diagnosis of the case was confirmed with a positive real-time polymerase
   chain reaction. On the third day of hospitalization, she had an increase
   in abdominal pain, confusion, and respiratory distress. She was
   transferred to the intensive care unit for close monitoring. On the
   fifth day of hospitalization, she developed fever again. Catheter and
   peripheral anaerobic blood cultures grew C. perfringens. No evidence of
   perforation was observed on abdominal tomography. It has been
