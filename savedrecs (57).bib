Abstract = {{The aldehyde radical of ribose C-1' at position 4324 in rat liver 28S
   rRNA generated by RNA N-glycosidase was either reduced to an hydroxyl
   group by sodium borohydride or converted into aldimine through a
   nucleophilic addition of amino acid used as a primary amine, Analysis of
   the R-fragment of 28S rRNA by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed
   that the reduction of aldehyde to an hydroxyl group with sodium
   borohydride was highly specific, The protein synthesis activity of
   modified ribosomes was partially restored with the removal of the active
   aldehyde by sodium borohydride or amino acid, Reduction of aldehyde with
   sodium borohydride restored 43.1\% of the protein synthesis activity,
   Among the twenty natural amino acids tested, tryptophan and histidine
   could restore 57.4\% and 42.1\% of the ribosome activity when brome
   mosaic virus RNA was used as mRNA, We came to the conclusion that the
   active aldehyde radical at position 4324 of 28S rRNA in modified
   ribosome may cause the inactivation of the ribosome for protein
   synthesis.}},

Abstract = {{Factor Xa (FXa) is an important serine protease in the blood coagulation
   cascade, Small synthetic competitive inhibitors of FXa are under
   development as potential anticoagulants. To better understand FXa
   structural features and molecular recognition mechanisms, we have
   constructed three dimensional models of FXa-inhibitor complex structures
   via a new search approach that samples conformational space and binding
   space simultaneously for DABE and DX-9065a, two bis amidinoaryl
   derivatives that are among the most potent and selective FXa inhibitors
   reported to date, We find the most probable binding modes for the two
   inhibitors to be a folded conformation, with one distal amidino group
   extending into the S1 pocket, forming a salt-bridge with FXa Asp-189,
   and the other positively charged group fitting into the S4 subsite, and
   stabilized by a cation-pi interaction, We propose as a hypothesis that
   the cavity-like S4 subsite formed by the three pi-faces of the aromatic
   residues Tyr-99, Phe-174 and Trp-215 is sufficiently rich in pi
   electrons that it is not only a hydrophobic pocket, but also forms a
   cation recognition site, This proposed cation-pi binding mechanism is
   one of the first proposed for enzymatic molecular recognition, and for
   which experimental verification can be obtained without any complicating
   charge compensation mechanism, Our models provide plausible explanations
   of the structure-activity relationships observed for these inhibitors,
   and suggest that cation-pi interactions may provide a novel mechanism
   for molecular recognition.}},

   comparison with experimental data for a single AlGaAs (or AlAs) barrier

Abstract = {{Lifetimes of states in Os-172 have been measured by the Doppler-shift
   recoil-distance method. These states were populated by the reaction
   Nd-144(S-32, 4n) 172Os at a bombarding energy of 162 MeV from the HHIRF
   tandem accelerator at ORNL. The data were collected in the gamma
   gamma-coincidence mode in order to reduce the complexities of the
   gamma-ray spectra and to avoid some of the problems associated with side
   feeding to excited states. The experimental transition quadrupole
   moments, Q(t), do not cluster about a constant value as a function of
   rotational frequency up through HBAR omega = 0.27 MeV as predicted by
   cranked Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) calculations around N = 96 for the
   yrast band. A striking feature in the experimental data for the yrast
   band is an abrupt increase of the Q(t) values for the 6(+) and 8(+)
   states where the first anomaly in the behavior of the moment of inertia
   occurs. A recent proposal of band-mixing between the yrast band and a
   quasi-beta band to account for this anomaly in the moment of inertia
   also seems to provide a logical interpretation of the Q(t) values at low
   rotational frequencies. The large collectivity inferred for the
   quasi-beta band from our Q(t) values for the 6(+) and 8(+) states is an
   indirect, but plausible, argument that the quasi-beta band corresponds
   to the non-yrast band in the band-mixing model. The E1 transition
   probabilities for decay of states in the (pi, alpha) = (-, 1) band to
   states in the ground-state band range between 1.4 X 10(-5) to 3.1 X
   10(-4) W.u. The B(E1, I --> 1 + 1) is an order of magnitude larger than
   the B(E1, I --> I - 1). The origin of these effects can probably be
   understood in terms of a predominant admixture of the Coriolis-coupled
   octupole vibrational-state wave function in the(-, 1) band of Os-172 at
   low spin.}},

   study examines the anti-tumour effect of the crude extract (CE) of
   Centella asiatica as well as its partially purified fractions (AF) from
   chromatographic procedures by both in vitro short and long term
   chemosensitivity and in vivo tumour model test systems. AF dose
   dependently inhibited the proliferation of the transformed cell lines
   significantly more than did the CE and other solvent fractions. Fifty
   percent effective doses on hour 3 exposure to AF were 17 and 22 mu g/ml
   for Ehrlich ascites tumour cells (EAC) and Dalton's lymphoma ascites
   tumour cells (DLA), respectively. However, practically no toxic effects
   were detected in normal human lymphocytes. AF also significantly
   suppressed the multiplication of mouse lung fibroblast (L-929) cells at
   a concentration of 8 mu g/ml in long term culture. Oral administration
   of the extracts (CE and AF) retarded the development of solid and
   ascites tumours and increased the life span of these tumour bearing
   mice. Tritiated thymidine, uridine and leucine incorporation assay
   suggest that the fraction acts directly on DNA synthesis.}},

Abstract = {{The substituent chemical shifts and the carbon-fluorine coupling
   constants of a range of 4-substituted cubyl fluorides in solvents of
   varying polarity are presented. Least squares regressional analysis of
   the data indicates that the fluorine probe, while being somewhat less
   sensitive to field effects as a result of the low polarizability of the
   cubane C-F bond, nevertheless responds in the `'reverse'' manner in
   agreement with precedents established in other alicyclic systems. The
   dependence of (1)J(CF) upon electronegativity has been interpreted as
   evidence for the occurrence of sigma-induction over four bonds, the
   longest reported to date. Significantly, resonance parameters are found
   to be very important in describing the effect of substituents on both
   the fluorine chemical shifts and the magnitude of the one-bond and
   four-bond C-13-F-19 coupling constants. This represents one of the rare
   occasions that resonance effects have been observed in a fully saturated
   system in the ground state. A possible mechanism by which these
   resonance effects may be transmitted is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Deprivation of vitamin A (retinol) leads to reduced potential of B cell
   proliferation and nearly complete block of T cell activation in vitro.
   Retinol, which is thought to function as a pro-hormone, is enzymatically
   converted into intracellular messenger molecules. Thus,
   14-hydroxy-retro-retinol (14-HRR) is an intracellular messenger molecule
   linked to activation and growth regulation of lymphocytes; whereas,
   anhydroretinol, another natural retro-retinoid, is an antagonist of
   14-HRR effects. In this article, we describe the isolation, structure
   determination, synthesis, and biological properties of a new
   intracellular retinol derivative, 13,14-dihydroxy-retinol (DHR), which
   also supports the viability of retinol-deprived lymphocytes. DHR is
   found in numerous cell lines representing a large cross-section of
   tissues and animals hom insects to mammals. In T lymphocytes the
   production of DHR and 14-HRR is up-regulated by phorbol ester. DHR is
   converted to 14-HRR by mild acid treatment, but not by cells; therefore
   DHR is not a biosynthetic intermediate in the conversion of retinol to
   14-HRR. DHR is a distinct end point of retinol metabolism. Although it
   is linked to cell proliferation, its biological role remains to be
   determined.}},

Abstract = {{Abasic sites are particularly important in mutation research because
   they are frequently the ultimate lesion in chemical mutagenesis, and
   because they are believed to be a paradigm for non-pairing lesions.
   Although preferential insertion of dAMP (''A-rule'') opposite the lesion
   has been observed in almost all previous studies with other organisms,
   we find that in budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the preferred
   nucleotide is dCMP, suggesting that yeast has a `'C-rule'', at least
   with respect to the vector constructs used. These constructs contained a
   single abasic site specifically located within a 28 nucleotide
   single-stranded region in an otherwise duplex vector. Nucleotide
   insertions were determined by sequence analysis of replicated vectors
   taken from a random set of yeast transformants. In three different
   sequence contexts, the frequencies of dCMP and dAMP insertion were 83\%
   and 13\%, 62\% and 31\%, and 85\% and 8\%, respectively. A similar bias
   in favor of cytosine insertion was found using vectors that were
   entirely single-stranded. However, a preference for dAMP insertion was
   found when Escherichia coli, rather than yeast, was transfected with
   samples of the same gapped duplex vector DNA. Preferential insertion of
   dCMP is not likely to have arisen by previously proposed mechanisms, but
   is also unlikely to have occurred by a primer/template misalignment
   mechanism, in which a nearby template guanine directs the insertion of
   cytosine. Predominant dCMP insertion was observed even when template
   guanine bases were excluded from a region extending 19 nucleotides 5',
   and 13 nucleotides 3', to the abasic site. (C) 1995 Academic Press

Abstract = {{Drosophila neuroglian is a transmembrane glycoprotein that has strong
   structural and sequence homology to the vertebrate L1 gene family of
   cell adhesion molecules (Bieber, A J., Snow, P. M., Hortsch, M., Patel,
   N. H., Jacobs, J. R., Traquina, Z. R., Schilling, J., and Goodman, C. S.
   (1989) Cell 59, 447-460). Two different neuroglian protein forms that
   are generated by a differential splicing process are expressed in a
   tissue-specific fashion by embryonic and larval cells (Hortsch, M.,
   Bieber, A. J., Patel, N. H., and Goodman, C. S. (1990) Neuron 4,
   697-709). The two neuroglian polypeptides differ only in their
   cytoplasmic domains. Both of these neuroglian species, when transfected
   into and expressed in Drosophila S2 cells, induce the
   calcium-independent, homophilic aggregation of transformed cells. A
   third artificial neuroglian protein form was constructed by substituting
   the neuroglian transmembrane segment and cytoplasmic domains with the
   glycosyl phosphatidylinositol attachment signal of the Drosophila
   fasciclin I protein. This cDNA construct generates a glycosyl
   phosphatidylinositol-anchored form of neuroglian, which retains the
   ability to induce homophilic cell aggregation when expressed in S2
   cells, and was able to interact with both of the two naturally occurring
   neuroglian polypeptides. These results demonstrate that neuroglian
   mediates a calcium-independent, homophilic cell adhesion activity and
   that neither cytoplasmic neuroglian domains nor a direct interaction
   with cytoskeletal elements is essential for this property.}},

Abstract = {{Cathepsin E (EC 3.4.23.34), an intracellular aspartic proteinase, was
   purified from monkey intestine by simple procedures that included
   affinity chromatography and fast protein liquid chromatography,
   Cathepsin E was very active at weakly acidic pH in the processing of
   chemically synthesized precursors such as the precursor to
   neurotensin/neuromedin, proopiomelanocortin, the precursor to xenopsin,
   and angiotensinogen. The processing sites were adjacent to a dibasic
   motif in the former two precursors and at hydrophobic recognition sites
   in the latter two, The common structural features that specified the
   processing sites were found in the carboxyl-terminal sequences of the
   active peptide moieties of these precursors; namely, the sequence
   Pro-Xaa-X'aa-hydrophobic amino acid was found at positions P4 through
   P1. Pro at the P4 position is thought to be important for directing the
   processing sites of the various precursor molecules to the active site
   of cathepsin E, Although the positions of Xaa and X'aa were occupied by
   various amino acids, including hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids,
   some of these had a negative effect, as typically observed when Glu/Arg
   and Pro were present at the P3 and P2 positions, respectively, Cathepsin
   D was much less active or was almost inactive in the processing of the
   precursors to neurotensin and related peptides as a result of the
   inability of the Pro-directed conformation of the precursor molecules to
   gain access to the active site of cathepsin D. Thus, the consensus
   sequence of precursors, Pro-Xaa-X'aa-hydrophobic amino acid, might not
   only generate the best conformation for cleavage by cathepsin E but
   might be responsible for the difference in specificities between
   cathepsins E and D.}},

Abstract = {{Assembly and disassembly of the nucleus at mitosis in eukaryotes
   involves the reversible interaction of chromatin with the nuclear
   membrane. previously we have shown that this interaction is regulated by
   the antagonistic activities of a kinase and a phosphatase. The kinase
   promotes membrane release while the phosphatase stimulates binding. In
   this report we describe four steps in the purification of the kinase
   needed for release of membranes from chromatin. We also show that the
   release kinase and the mitotic initiation kinase, cdcs, are distinct and
   are separated from each other during the second purification step.
   Reconstitution experiments using these two kinases demonstrate that the
   release kinase and cdc2 kinase work in concert to cause membrane release
   from chromatin. In phosphorylation experiments, protein targets that are
   substrates for the regulatory release kinase are identified on the
   membranes. These phosphorylated proteins are candidates for regulated
   proteins mediating membrane-chromatin interaction. Finally, we find that
   membrane release activity can also be extracted from membranes by high
   salt treatment, indicating a possible dual localization of this
   activity.}},

Abstract = {{The leu-500 mutation can be suppressed in S. typhimurium topA. Previous
   studies have demonstrated that the plasmid-borne leu-500 minimal
   promoter cannot be activated in topA mutants unless adjacent (<250 bp)
   transcription occurs away from the leu-500 promoter (short-range
   promoter interaction). To search for a potential upstream promoter
   responsible for activation of leu-500 in the chromosomal context, we
   have identified the ilvlH promoter, located 1.9 kb upstream of leu-500
   (long-range promoter interaction). Different from short-range promoter
   interaction, which is abolished by DNA sequence insertions, the
   long-range promoter interaction is mediated by the intervening DNA
   sequence. These studies suggest that the long-range interaction between
   a pair of divergently arrayed promoters is probably mediated by a
   complex process involving relay of DNA supercoiling by the DNA sequence
   located between the two promoters.}},

Abstract = {{The collagen framework of hyaline cartilage is based on copolymers of
   types II, IX, and XI collagens, Previous studies have established
   specific covalent interactions between types II and IX collagens, The
   present study examined cross-linking sites in type XI collagen to define
   better the full heteropolymeric assembly, Pepsin-solubilized type XI
   collagen was purified from fetal bovine cartilage, The cross-linking
   amino acids in the preparation were primarily divalent,
   borohydride-reducible structures; pyridinoline residues were essentially
   absent. Individual alpha 1(XI), alpha 2(XI), and alpha 3(XI) chains were
   resolved by high performance liquid chromatography, Telopeptides still
   attached by cross-links to helical sites were released by periodate
   oxidation and identified by microsequencing, Analysis of cross-linked
   peptides isolated from trypsin digests of each alpha-chain identified
   the attachment helical sites for the telopeptides. A high degree of
   interchain specificity was evident in the cross-linking between type XI
   collagen molecules, The dominant cross-links were between N-telopeptides
   and the COOH terminus of the triple-helix, consistent with a head-to
   tail interaction of molecules staggered by 4D (D = 67 nm) periods. In
   addition, alpha 1(II) C-telopeptide was linked to the amino terminal
   site of the alpha 1(XI) triple helix. In summary, the results show that
   type XI collagen molecules are primarily cross-linked to each other in
   cartilage, implying that a homopolymer is initially formed. Links to
   type II collagen are also indicated, consistent with an eventual
   cofibrillar assembly. Analysis of cartilage extracts showed that all
   three chains, alpha 1(XI), alpha 2(XI), and alpha 3(XI), had at least in
   part retained their N-propeptides in cartilage matrix and that the alpha
   3(XI) chain was the IIB splicing variant product of the COL2A1 gene. Of
   particular note was the finding that the N-telopeptide cross-linking
   site in both alpha 1(XI) and alpha 2(XI) is located amino-terminal to
   the putative N-propeptidase cleavage site, This structural feature
   provides a potential mechanism for the proteolytic depolymerization of
   type XI collagen by proteases that can cleave between the cross-link and
   the triple helix (e.g. stromelysin).}},

   of total cut length, in time approximately proportional to the square of
   the number of sources. The method enables one to unwrap unfiltered

Abstract = {{INSULATOR DNAs, or boundary elements, functionally isolate neighbouring
   genes by blocking interactions between distal enhancers and
   inappropriate target promoters(1-5). The best-characterized insulators
   in Drosophila correspond to a 340-base-pair (bp) fragment from the gypsy
   retrotransposon(3), and the scs and scs' sequences flanking the 87A1
   hsp70 locus(1,2). Here we demonstrate that both insulators block the
   interaction of defined even-skipped (eve) stripe enhancers(6,7) when
   positioned between the enhancer and the target promoter. The
   simultaneous use of two stripe enhancers (eve stripes 2 and 3) provides
   evidence that enhancers lying distal to the insulator are selectively
   blocked. The insertion of stripe- insulator-stripe sequences between two
   divergently transcribed promoters indicates that enhancers barred from
   acting on one basal promoter are fully accessible to appropriate
   regulatory factors for activating the other promoter. These results
   suggest that insulators do not propagate changes in chromatin structure.
   Finally, we present evidence that the gypsy insulator does not block
   interactions between a silencer element and a basal promoter, Taken
   together, these results suggest that insulators might not be restricted
   to the functional isolation of neighbouring genetic loci. Rather, they
   might function as flexible regulatory elements that modulate
   enhancer-promoter interactions within complex promoters and complex
   genetic loci.}},

Volume = {{449}},
Number = {{1, 1}},
Pages = {{236-245}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies of faint high-latitude carbon stars have shown that a
   significant fraction of them are not distant asymptotic giant branch
   (AGB) stars but rather belong to the local population of spheroid
   dwarfs. In this paper we attempt a theoretical prediction of the local
   space density of such dwarf carbon stars (dCs) based on the assumption
   that they are ordinary main-sequence stars that were able to accrete
   enough carbon-enriched material from a binary companion on the AGB to
   make their C/O ratio larger than unity.
   A simulated population of dCs is constructed by following the evolution
   of a large number of binaries using simple analytic fits to detailed
   evolutionary calculations and determining which ones would presently
   contain a dC. The zero-age parameters of the sample are chosen randomly
   from distributions derived from the observed properties of unevolved
   binaries.
   The space density of halo dCs that we predict (similar to 2-4 x 10(-7)
   pc(-3)) is in agreement with current observational constraints. The
   predicted local space density of disk dCs (similar to 1 x 10(-6) pc(-3))
   may be somewhat higher than observed. The fraction of binaries that
   produces dCs depends strongly on initial metallicity, and virtually no
   dCs are formed in systems with an initial metallicity of more than half
   solar. Thus, all disk dCs are predicted to be in binaries that formed in
   the very early phases of disk star formation, and their number depends
   strongly on assumptions about the age-metallicity relation during this
   epoch. The predictions for the halo are much less model-dependent.
   The simulated orbital period distributions are bimodal, with one peak
   between 10(3) and 10(5) days and another peak between 10(2) and 10(3)
   days. The shorter period component is caused by systems that have gone
   through a common envelope phase. The simulated period distributions bear
   a strong resemblance to the observed orbital period distribution of
   barium and CH giants, which may be the evolved descendants of the disk
   and halo dC populations we have modeled.}},

Abstract = {{THE photovoltaic effect involves the production of electrons and holes
   in a semiconductor device under illumination, and their subsequent
   collection at opposite electrodes. In many inorganic semiconductors,
   photon absorption produces free electrons and holes directly(1). But in
   molecular semiconductors, absorption creates electron-hole pairs
   (excitons) which are bound at room temperature(2), so that charge
   collection requires their dissociation, Exciton dissociation is known to
   be efficient at interfaces between materials with different electron
   affinities and ionization potentials, where the electron is accepted by
   the material with larger electron affinity and the hole by the material
   with lower ionization potential(3). A two-layer diode structure can thus
   be used, in which excitons generated in either layer diffuse towards the
   interface between the layers. However, the exciton diffusion range is
   typically at least a factor of 10 smaller than the optical absorption
   depth, thus limiting the efficiency of charge collection(3). Here we
   show that the interpenetrating network formed from a phase-segregated
   mixture of two semiconducting polymers provides both the spatially
   distributed interfaces necessary for efficient charge photogeneration,
   and the means for separately collecting the electrons and holes. Devices
   using thin films of these polymer mixtures show promise for large-area
   photodetectors.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments have been conducted to investigate the effect of melt on the
   creep behavior of water-free olivine aggregates deformed in the
   dislocation creep regime. The influence of the melt phase is modest at
   melt fractions less than similar to 0.04. However, at melt fractions >
   0.04, the creep rate of melt-added samples is enhanced by more than an
   order of magnitude relative to melt-free aggregates. This unexpectedly
   large influence of melt on strain rate arises because deformation occurs
   by grain boundary sliding (GBS) accommodated by a dislocation creep
   process. Four observations support this hypothesis. (1) The strain rate
   enhancement observed in the dislocation creep regime can be related to
   the Stress concentration caused by the reduction in the solid-solid
   grain boundary area. (2) Both melt-free and melt-added samples exhibit
   strain rates indicating that deformation is limited by slip on
   (010){[}100], the easiest slip system in olivine. (3) The GBS mechanism
   occurs near the transition between diffusion and dislocation creep. (4)
   Grains in specimens deformed in the GBS regime are not significantly
   flattened, even after similar to 50\% shortening. in melt-free
   aggregates, a transition from the GBS mechanism to dislocation creep
   limited by slip on (010){[}001], the hardest slip system, is observed
   with an increase in grain size. A transition to (010){[}001] limited
   creep was not observed for partially molten aggregates because grain
   growth was inhibited by the presence of melt. The results of this study
   indicate that the viscosity of the upper mantle may decrease by at least
   an order of magnitude if the retained melt fraction exceeds 0.04 or if
   the onset of melting results in a reduction in grain size and a
   concomitant transition from (010){[}001] to (010){[}100] limited creep.}},

Abstract = {{Reaction of laser-generated metal cations (Fe+ and LaO+) with methanol
   clusters was studied in a molecular beam. The reaction products were
   analyzed by a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. A general reaction
   pattern is that of the methanol-methanol reaction which produces ether
   and water and which is induced by collision with the metal cations.
   However, very different reaction behaviors were found for Fe+ and LaO+.
   For Fe+, there was a critical size (n greater than or equal to 12) for
   the reaction of methanol clusters (CH3OH)(n), with ether loss and H2O
   retention. On the other hand, for LaO+, this critical size was 2, and
   the result was H2O loss and ether retention. Multiple-ether formation
   was identified in a narrow cluster size region with the number of MeOHs
   ranging from 2 to 4. Furthermore, the series corresponding to
   LaO+(MeOH)(n) or LaO+(Me(2)O)(MeOH)(n-2)(H2O) suddenly appeared for n
   greater than or equal to 12. The two different reaction patterns are
   discussed in terms of electrostatic and covalent effects in the presence

Abstract = {{In the production of drinking water from river water, the quality of the
   raw water is extremely important. For this reason the Water Transport
   Company Rhine-Kennemerland (WRK) operates, among others, an early
   warning system. This system was found to be inappropriate for the
   detection of certain chlorophenoxy herbicides (e.g., 2,4-D, MCPP, MCPA
   and 2,4-DP) that are occasionally found in the Rhine in increased levels
   (above the drinking water norm of 0.1 mu g l(-1)). Commercially
   available immunoassay kits were evaluated for use in pre-screening. With
   some modifications to adapt the working range and to enhance the
   sensitivity of the kits, they were found to be applicable in the early
   warning. Comparison with a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
   reference analysis revealed no false negative results and a rate of
   false positive results of about 10\%. However, it should be taken into
   account that matrix effects may affect the results. A daily sampling
   frequency combined with an analysis frequency based on the actual flow
   in the river allowed for a periodic batchwise analysis. This permitted a
   timely availability of the results as well as a cost-effective use of
   the (modified) kits.}},

Abstract = {{A theory for the reflection-transmission problem of linear water waves
   in shallow channels with large-amplitude, rapidly varying topographies
   is given in Nachbin and Papanicolaou (1992b). However, it is very
   difficult to extract quantitative information from the theory in the
   large-amplitude regime. In this work, theoretical parameters are
   evaluated numerically, through the use of a numerical
   Schwarz-Christoffel transformation and of a Monte Carlo simulation. This
   enables the theory to be applied to its full extent. As a result we
   calculate the localization length for any given type of random bottom
   topography. Additionally, the numerical conformal mapping provides
   further insight into depth effects arising from potential theory.
   Statistical results, for numerically generated reflected waves, are in
   very good agreement with the theory for both piecewise-linear and
   piecewise-constant topographies of large amplitude.}},

Abstract = {{The feasibility of a simple, single-use immunomigration strip assay for
   alachlor was previously demonstrated. In the device, capillary action
   caused alachlor and alachlor-tagged, dye-containing liposomes to migrate
   through an anti-alachlor antibody zone, on a plastic-backed
   nitrocellulose strip, where competitive binding occurred. Unbound
   liposomes continued migration to a liposome capture zone, where they
   were quantified by densitometry. The amount of liposome-entrapped dye
   measured in this zone was directly proportional to the alachlor
   concentration in the sample. This report describes modifications to
   various components of the system, leading to improvement in the
   sensitivity of the assay to the point where the maximum contaminant
   level of alachlor, 2 ppb, can be easily detected. Measurements of
   liposome size and antibody cross-reactivity are also presented. The new
   methodology involves acid treatment of the antibody and the use of
   preincubation of the analyte-tagged liposomes, free analyte and
   anti-alachlor before initiating migration. This results in strong
   interactions between the anti-alachlor, liposome and strip such that
   liposomes that have bound to antibody do not migrate. This inhibition of
   migration is reversed by free analyte, which competes with the liposome
   for the available antibody binding sites. As in the previous assay,
   unbound liposomes migrate to a capture zone where they can be
   quantified, and the color intensity of this zone is directly
   proportional to the amount of analyte present. This technique produces
   an assay capable of detecting alachlor at levels down to 1 ppb.}},

Abstract = {{The kinetics of cyanide binding to cytochrome c oxidase were
   systematically studied as a function of {[}HCN], {[}oxidase], pH, ionic
   strength, temperature, type and concentration of solubilizing detergent,
   and monomer-dimer content of oxidase. On the basis of these results a
   minimum reaction mechanism is proposed in which the spectrally visible
   rapid and slow cyanide binding reactions are two consecutive first-order
   reactions, not parallel reactions with different conformers of
   cytochrome c oxidase. The fast reaction (k(obs)') follows saturation
   type kinetics to form an HCN complex that subsequently undergoes a slow
   reaction (k(obs)''). The fast k(obs)' reaction is independent of ionic
   strength but is strongly dependent upon pH. Two pK values were evaluated
   from the bell-shaped rate versus pH profile; one is due to an ionizable
   group on the protein (pK(a) = 7.45), while the other is that of HCN
   (pK(HCN) = 9.15). Therefore, oxidase is reactive toward HCN only when
   the group on the protein is unprotonated. The slow k(obs)'' reaction is
   not a reaction of oxidase with either CN- or HCN; in fact, the product
   formed by the fast k(obs)' reaction, the oxidase-HCN complex, still
   undergoes the slow k `' process even if all of the excess KCN is
   removed. The apparent rate constant of the slower phase (k(obs)'') is
   independent of all the variations done in this study, and it probably
   corresponds to either a slow conformational change in the protein or a
   change in ligand coordination at one of the metal centers after HCN
   binds to the bimetallic center of oxidase. Based upon the bell-shaped pH
   dependence of the fast phase and the pH independence of the slow phase,
   the mechanism also predicts that a single conformer of cytochrome c
   oxidase can exhibit either monophasic or biphasic cyanide binding
   kinetics depending upon the pH. At either very low or very high pH, the
   two rates become comparable in magnitude, which makes the reaction
   appear to be monophasic even though both reactions still occur. The
   amount of monomeric or dimeric oxidase only slightly affects the
   magnitude of k(obs)' and k(obs)'' values, and both processes are clearly
   present in both types of oxidase.}},

   alpha = 100.22(4), beta = 99.74(3), gamma = 101.83(2)degrees. The two
   nickel(II) ions are bound to four nitrogens from two bipyridyl groups
   and two oxygen atoms from the ether linkers in a grossly distorted
   octahedral geometry. The complex has a non-helical configuration and the
   two naphthalene rings are parallel and offset by 4.11 Angstrom. The
   torsional flexibility of the ether linkers facilitates this orientation
   and allows the aromatic rings to stack in the complex. In solution L(1),
   which contains a 2,6-disubstituted naphthalene spacer, forms non-helical
   and helical {[}2 + 2] tridentate metallomacrocycles with zinc(II) (7:3)
   and cadmium(II) (45:55), and forms a labile complex(es) with
   mercury(II). No complexation with iron(II) or ruthenium(II) was
   observed. The effect of the substitution pattern of the naphthalene
   spacer was examined by comparison of the zinc(II) complexes obtained
   with L(1), a 2.7-disubstituted naphthalene (L(2)) and a
   1,5-disubstituted naphthalene (L(3)). While L(1) and L(2) both formed
   mixtures of {[}2 + 2] complexes, L(3) formed a {[}1 + 1] complex.
   Ligands L(1) and L(5) (containing a p-CH2C6H4CH2 spacer) exhibited poor
   ligand self-self recognition properties when treated with zinc(II).}},

Abstract = {{The supersymmetric extension of the standard model suffers from a
   problem of baryon-number violation. Discrete (and global) symmetries
   introduced to protect the proton are unstable under gravitational
   effects. We add a gauged U(1)(x) to the standard model gauge group G(SM)
   and require it to be anomaly-free. As new (chiral) superfields we only
   allow G(SM)-singlets in order to maintain the good unification
   predictions. We find the most general set of solutions for the rational
   singlet charges. We embed our models in local supersymmetry and study
   the breaking of supersymmetry and U(1)(x) to determine M(x). We
   determine the full non-renormalizable and gauge invariant Lagrangian for
   the different solutions. We expect any effective theory to contain
   baryon- and lepton-number violating terms of dimension four suppressed
   by powers of M(X)/M(Pl). The power is predicted by the U(1)(x) charges.
   We find consistency with the experimental bounds on the proton lifetime
   and on the neutrino masses. We also expect all supersymmetric models to
   have an unstable but longlived lightest supersymmetric particle.
   Consistency with underground experiments on upward going muons leads to
   stricter constraints than the proton decay experiments. These are barely
   satisfied.}},

Abstract = {{Human tracheal glands are considered as the principle secretory
   structures in the bronchotracheal tree. In earlier studies, we
   successfully performed primary cultures of human tracheal gland (HTG)
   serous cells and noted that these cells were responsive to many
   secretagogues including purinergic agonists but not to the inflammatory
   mediator adenosine. In this study, we demonstrate that adenosine was
   capable of inducing stimulation of protein secretion by HTG serous cells
   which had previously been cultured in pro-inflammatory conditions
   (induced by Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)). This stimulation was inhibited by
   8-phenyltheophylline but not by dipyridamole, which is indicative of a
   P1 purinoceptor. This inducible receptor is of the adenosine A2 subtype
   {[}rank potency order: 5'-(N-ethyl)-carboxamidoadenosine (NECA) >
   adenosine > N-6-(phenylisopropyl)-adenosine (PIA); and stimulation of
   adenylyl cyclase]. The adenosine-induced protein secretion was
   concentration-dependent, however, increased intracellular cyclic
   adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) was not dependent oo the concentration of
   adenosine. The adenosine-induced secretion and the ATP-induced secretion
   were shown to be additive. This study concludes that there is evidence
   of a LPS-inducible adenosine A2 receptor in human tracheal gland serous
   cells.}},

Abstract = {{The sensitivity of heterojunction-bipolar-transistor- (HBT-) based OEIC
   receivers with metal-semiconductor metal photodetectors (MSM-PD) or
   p-i-n photodetectors (p-i-n-PD) are compared. With an accurate
   small-signal circuit model of an InP/InGaAs HBT, it is shown that
   sensitivity of the p-i-n-HBT receiver is higher than char of the MSM-HBT
   receiver even though the high-frequency equivalent input noise current
   density is higher for the former than the latter. However; the HBT
   receiver using MSM-PD with light transparent conducting fingers would
   offer a potential sensitivity improvement of 0.5 dB over the p-i-n-HBT
   receiver at la Gbit/s due to an increased responsivity of the MSM-PD.

Abstract = {{Polypeptide hormones and neuropeptides are initially synthesized as
   precursors possessing one or several domains that constitute the
   propeptide. Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that
   expression of anglerfish prosomatostatin-I (proSRIF-I) in rat anterior
   pituitary GH(3) cells resulted in efficient and accurate cleavage of the
   prohormone to generate the mature 14-amino acid peptide, SRIF-I. We also
   implicated the propeptide in mediating intracellular sorting to the
   trans Golgi network where proteolytic processing is initiated. In
   contrast, expression of a second form of the precursor, proSRIF-II in
   GH(3) cells resulted in its intracellular degradation in an acidic,
   post-trans Golgi network compartment, most probably lysosomes. To
   further investigate the positive sorting signal present in proSRIF-I, we
   constructed a chimera comprising the signal peptide and proregion of
   SRIF-I fused to proSRIF-II and expressed the cDNA in GH(3) cells. Here
   we demonstrate that the propeptide of SRIF-I rescued proSRIF-II from
   intracellular degradation quantitatively and diverted it to secretory
   vesicles. Furthermore, the chimera was processed to SRIF-28, an
   amino-terminally extended form of the hormone that is the physiological
   cleavage product of proSRIF-II processing in vivo. Most significantly,
   the SRIF-I propeptide functioned only in cis as part of the fusion
   protein and not in trans when expressed as a separate polypeptide. These
   data suggest that the SRIF-I propeptide may possess a sorting signal for
   sequestration into the secretory pathway rather than functioning as an
   intramolecular chaperone to promote protein folding.}},

Abstract = {{Sodium beraprost, a newly synthesized PGl(2) analogue inhibited in a
   dose-dependent manner formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP)
   induced superoxide generation of human neutrophils, but it had no effect
   on the superoxide synthesis by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or
   A23187. Sodium beraprost inhibited Ca2+ influx in fMLP stimulated
   neutrophils employing fluorometry and confocal microscopy. These
   findings suggested that the inhibitory effect of sodium beraprost on
   fMLP induced speroxide generation was due to suppression of Ca2+ influx.
   To examine the relationship between the effect of sodium beraprost and
   phosphorylation of p47phox (the 47kDa cytosolic phagocyte oxidase
   factor), immuno-precipitation of p47phox and western blotting for
   phospho-amino acids were performed. Phosphorylation of serine residues
   of p47phox induced by fMLP was reduced in the presence of sodium
   beraprost in a dose-dependent manner. The reduction in phosphorylation
   was accompanied by a reduction in p47phox and p67phox translocation to
   the plasma membrane and superoxide generation. These findings suggested
   that p47phox phosphorylation was necessary for translocation and
   superoxide generation in fMLP activated neutrophils, and that p47phox
   phosphorylation was regulated by a Ca2+ dependent mechanism. These
   observations suggested that sodium beraprost inhibited fMLP induced
   superoxide generation of human neutrophils by the inhibition of p47phox
   phosphorylation and translocation by a Ca2+ dependent mechanism.}},

   abrupt, occurred 100 to 150 milliseconds after the go signal, and was

Abstract = {{In order to identify cDNAs that can induce oncogenic transformation, a
   retroviral vector was used to transfer a library of cDNAs from the
   murine 32D hemopoietic cell line into NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. We have
   identified and recovered a provirus containing a 1.8-kilobase pair cDNA
   whose expression causes morphological transformation in NIH 3T3 cells.
   The transforming cDNA contains a complete open reading frame that
   encodes a protein (designated Lfc) with a region of sequence similarity
   to the product of the lbc oncogene. This region includes a domain that
   is characteristic of the CDC24 family of guanine nucleotide exchange
   factors in tan dem with a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. The Lfc
   protein is distinguished from Lbc by a 150-amino acid NH2-terminal
   extension that contains a cysteine- and histidine-rich domain similar to
   the diacylglycerol-binding site (zinc butterfly) found in protein kinase
   C. NH2- and COOH-terminal deletion analysis revealed that both the PH
   and putative guanine nucleotide exchange factor domains are required,
   but the zinc butterfly is dispensable, for transformation. Although the
   removal of the PH domain of the Lfc protein completely eliminated its
   ability to transform MH 3T3 cells, replacement of this domain with an
   isoprenylation site restored all of its transforming activity. This
   suggests that a PH domain-dependent recruitment of the Lfc protein to
   the cellular membrane is a necessary step for cellular transformation.
   The lfc gene is expressed in a broad range of tissues as well as in a
   variety of hemopoietic and non-hemopoietic cell lines. Lfc appears to be
   a new member of a growing family of proteins that are likely to act as
   activators of Ras-like proteins in a developmental or cell-lineage
   specific manner.}},

   cutting problems, where a rectangular plate is cut into a number of
   rectangular pieces in such a way as to optimize an objective function.
   We reduce the state-space of the problem by considering non-guillotine
   cutting patterns which are combinations of guillotine and simple
   non-guillotine cuts. These cutting patterns are represented as complete
   paths in an AND/OR-graph and a branch and bound method is described. We
   provide rules and heuristics that reduce the graph search and present

Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{376}},
Number = {{6539}},
Pages = {{418-419}},
Month = {{AUG 3}},
Abstract = {{OPTIMIZATION models have been widely and successfully used in
   evolutionary ecology to predict the attributes of organisms(1-6) Most
   such models maximize darwinian fitness (or a component of fitness) in
   the face of trade-offs and constraints; the numerical results usually
   depend on the exact form of the trade-offs/constraints. Here we report
   the first (to our knowledge) numerical optimum for life-history
   evolution which is independent of the details of the underlying
   trade-off, for a large array for trade-off forms. The rule is that at
   small litter sizes, the range in offspring size is inversely
   proportional to the size of the litter. Details of the
   offspring-survival/offspring-size trade-off(7-10) set the value of the
   proportionality constant, but the -1 exponent, the inverse
   proportionality itself, is universal. Studies of life histories have
   yielded many empirical examples of universality for various scaling
   exponents (for example, adult lifespan scales as approximate to 0.25
   with adult body mass within many taxa); this is an example of the
   numerical value of an exponent (here -1) emerging from a life-history
   model as independent of all but a few general features of the underlying
   economic structure.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of cutting parts from a piece of material occurs in a number
   of settings. When the pieces to be cut are non-rectangular, the problem
   is called the irregular pattern layout problem (or nesting problem).
   This problem occurs in sheet metal and apparel industries, for example.
   One possible approach is to combine individual pieces into low-waste
   `modules' which are then arranged by a heuristic technique. In this
   spirit, the Minimal-Area Convex Enclosure Problem is solved in this
   paper. Given two simple polygons, the algorithm finds the relative
   position of one with respect to the other such that the area of their
   convex enclosure is minimized. The technique searches along the envelope
   (or no-fit-polygon), dynamically maintaining the convex enclosure
   vertices as well as an analytic representation of the area. The
   algorithm runs quickly and computational experience is included.}},

   INFUSION IN PATIENTS WITH DISEASE RECURRENCE AFTER PRIOR THERAPY WITH
   ANTHRACYCLINES}},

Abstract = {{Background: To date, anthracyclines are the most active drugs against
   breast tumors, and the taxane paclitaxel (Taxol) looks very promising,
   Both classes of drugs are affected by cellular multidrug-resistance
   mechanisms, and therefore their sequential use raises the possibility of
   clinical cross-resistance. It is therefore important to assess the
   activity of paclitaxel in patients with clinical resistance to
   anthracyclines. Purpose: We assessed the safety and efficacy of
   paclitaxel administered by the logistically convenient 3-hour infusion
   to breast cancer patients who had disease progression within 12 months
   since prior therapy with anthracyclines, Methods: Fifty-one patients
   with metastatic breast cancer who had all relapsed or whose disease had
   progressed within 12 months from completion of an
   anthracycline-containing chemotherapy protocol (six receiving adjuvant
   therapy, 19 receiving neoadjuvant therapy, and 26 receiving treatment
   for metastatic disease) were enrolled in this phase II trial from June
   1992 to May 1994. After medication to prevent type I acute
   hypersensitivity reactions, paclitaxel was given intravenously over 3
   hours at 175 mg/m(2) to the first 15 patients and at 225 mg/m(2) to the
   next 36 patients. The median age was 50 years (range, 31-62 years), and
   the median Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 0
   (range, 0-2). Results: Patients received a median of five cycles (range,
   one to 11 cycles). After initial doses of 175 and 225 mg/m(2),
   paclitaxel could be increased by 25 mg/m(2) in 73\% and 58\% of cycles,
   respectively. Among 50 assessable patients, seven achieved a complete
   response and 12 achieved a partial response (response rate, 38\% {[}95\%
   confidence interval = 25\%-53\%]). The median duration sponse was 7
   months (range, months), and the median time to disease progression for
   all patients was 5 months. Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 3\% of the
   cycles and in 12\% of the patients and was never associated with fever
   and infection. Common toxic effects were myalgia and arthralgia (94\% of
   the patients; 4\% grade 3), peripheral neuropathy (92\% of the patients;
   8\% grade 3), and alopecia (all patients). Pruritus and neuropathy were
   significantly more frequent and severe, respectively, with the higher
   dose (P<.01 by chi(2) test). Frequency and severity of other toxic
   effects were similar at either starting dose. Ten patients had symptoms
   of neuro-optic toxicity. Only one patient had a grade 2 hypersensitivity
   reaction. Conclusions: Paclitaxel at starting doses of 175 and 225
   mg/m(2) given as a 3-hour infusion can safely be administered to, and is
   active in women whose disease has progressed after prior treatment with
   anthracyclines. There was evidence of increased toxicity at the higher
   dose but no suggestion of better efficacy. Implication: Paclitaxel by a
   3-hour infusion in combination with doxorubicin should be investigated
   in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Unless randomized trials
   demonstrate greater efficacy of the more toxic higher dose, it is
   suggested that a dose of 175-200 mg/m(2) be administered with the 3-hour
   infusion schedule.}},

Abstract = {{Polymeric films of {[}Fe-II(CN)(6)-Pt-IV(NH3)(4)](n) were prepared on
   optically transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode surfaces via
   oxidative polymerization of the monomer
   {[}Pt(NH3)(4)](2){[}(NC)(5)Fe-CN-Pt(NH3)(4)-NC-Fe(CN)(5)]. Irradiation
   at 457 nm into the intervalence charge transfer band of the interfacial
   polymer causes the cleavage of bridging -CN- to Pt bonds, leading to the
   dissociation of polymeric film into shorter-chain {[}Fe-Pt](n)
   oligomers, {[}Pt(NH3)(4)](2+) and {[}Fe(CN)(6)](3-). When photolysis is
   carried out with the modified interface immersed in an aqueous solution
   containing transition metal cations M(n+) (M(n+) = Ni2+, Fe2+, Mn2+,
   Cr3+), M(n+) reacts with photogenerated {[}Fe(CN)(6)](3-) complexes to
   form mixed metal cyanometalates of the form {[}M-NC-Fe(CN)(5)](2-) on
   the electrode surface. As a result, M(n+) is incorporated into the
   interfacial lattice only at the irradiated regions. The film after M(n+)
   incorporation is different in color compared to the original
   {[}Fe-Pt](n) polymer film. Images may be developed on such a film by
   irradiating the sample through a mask. In this paper we report: the

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to examine distinctive clinical
   characteristics of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM)
   patients in Kuwait including mode of presentation at diagnosis, family
   history of diabetes, therapeutic management and response to treatment,
   We studied 3299 Kuwaiti patients (1454 male (M) and 1845 female (F)
   subjects) registered in Salmiya diabetic clinic, a part of the national
   network of diabetes control and care programme, and located in the urban
   Hawally Governorate, Kuwait. The mean age of the patients was 53 years
   (+/-13.9 years), and 73.8\% were in the age group 45-64 years. The
   majority of patients (53.6\%) were diagnosed as they were clinically
   symptomatic; in contrast a significant minority (37.8\%) were diagnosed
   by chance mainly during investigation for unrelated events. The 8.6\% of
   the women diagnosed during pregnancy had a high parity index 6.5 +/-
   2.9. A high percentage of the diabetic patients (63\%) reported a
   positive family history in first degree relatives. The mean duration of
   diabetes mellitus was 7.8 years (range 2-28 years) and 70\% of the
   patients had diabetes mellitus for 9 years or less. The mean body mass
   index (BMI) was 31.8 +/- 6.3 kg/m(2) and 28.5 +/- 6.3 kg/m(2) in women
   and men, respectively. Among the diabetic women 57.7\% were obese (BM >
   30 kg/m(2)) and 30.2\% were overweight (BMI 25-30 kg/m(2)) as compared
   to 33.6\% and 44.3\% among diabetic men, respectively. High blood
   pressure (greater than or equal to 160/95 mmHg) was reported in 14.9\%.
   The main therapeutic modality in the majority of patients, (63.2\%), was
   the administration of oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHA), while 23.7\% were
   on a diet regimen and only 13.1\% were on insulin therapy. The study
   throws light on the pattern of NIDDM among Kuwaiti patients. Frequent
   association with obesity suggests that it may be a major risk factor,
   The strong familial aggregation reported paves the way for future
   research among these families for cosegregation of a defined genetic
   trait with NIDDM in the Arab population subset.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to determine the effect of matrix on the

   study was conducted in two kinds of landscape: (1) an agricultural
   landscape, where the censused forest habitat fragments were surrounded
   by farmland, and (2) in an intensively managed forested landscape, where
   the censused habitat fragments were surrounded by nonhabitat coniferous
   forest. Occupied and unoccupied habitat fragments in the agricultural
   landscape differed significantly in distance to the nearest suitable
   continuous habitat, with hazel grouse occurring only in habitat
   fragments closer than 100 m from continuous forest. In the intensively
   managed forest landscape, the effect of isolation was less evident, but
   there might be a threshold around 2 km. Effects of isolation occurred
   over much shorter distances when the surrounding habitats consisted of
   farmland than when it was forested habitats. The size of the habitat
   fragments was important in both landscapes, with larger habitat
   fragments more often containing hazel grouse.}},

Abstract = {{Dextrans are nontoxic and can be obtained in a wide variety of molecular
   weights. The purpose of this study was to label 6-kDa and 40-kDa
   dextrans with gamma- (Tc-99m) and positron- (F-18) emitting
   radioisotopes and monitor their transport across the pulmonary
   microvascular barrier. Methods: External scan measurements for
   radiolabeled uncharged dextrans, albumin and red blood cells were
   obtained ill eight blood-perfused in situ rabbit lung preparations.
   After 3 hr of external scanning, the lungs were removed for postmortem
   and extravascular distribution volume calculations. Extravascular
   distribution volumes were obtained in six additional rabbits following 4
   hr of dextran perfusion to compare the effect of time. The normalized
   slope index (NSI), a measure of transvascular transport rate, was
   calculated for each diffusible tracer. Results: The mean NSI for albumin
   (0.001676 +/- 0.000537 min(-1)) was significantly lower than NSI for the
   40-kDa dextran (0.002303 +/- 0.0005426 min(-1)) as well as the 6-kDa
   dextran (0.004312 +/- 0.001134 min(-1)). The difference between the
   6-kDa and the 40-kDa dextrans was also significant. After 4 hr of
   equilibration, distribution volumes were not significantly different
   than those obtained at 3 hr. Conclusion: Dextrans can be radiolabeled
   with gamma and positron emitters and small dextrans traverse the lung
   microvascular barrier more rapidly than albumin. Our results suggest
   that the use of small dextrans rather than albumin can reduce scan times
   in clinical applications and minimize motion artifact associated with
   the noninvasive gamma detection method.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To determine the relationship between maternal weight gain
   pattern and birth weight.
   Methods: All nonobese, white women delivered at the University of
   California, San Francisco, between 1980-1990 were eligible for this
   study. Our study group included 2994 uncomplicated pregnancies with
   complete data. All recorded prenatal weight gain measurements were used
   to estimate maternal trimester weight gain, pattern of gain (based on
   low versus not-low gain at each trimester), and total gain at delivery.
   Multiple linear regression analysis was used to assess the relationship
   between these weight gain measurements and fetal birth weight.
   Results: After adjustment for seven covariates, each kilogram of
   maternal gain in the first, second, and third trimesters was associated
   with statistically significant increases in fetal birth weight of 18.0,
   32.8, and 17.0 g, respectively. When compared with the pattern of gain
   that was not low in any trimester, patterns with low gain in the first
   and second trimesters or in the second and third trimesters were
   associated with significant decreases in birth weights of 133.0 and 88.5
   g, but no important change in birth weight was seen for the group whose
   gains were low in the first and third trimesters. These findings were
   not due to differences in total weight gain, which averaged
   approximately 11 kg in these three pattern groups.
   Conclusion: The results suggest that specific patterns of maternal
   weight gain, particularly weight gain during the second trimester, are
   related to fetal birth weight.}},

   of 33 children, 7-16 y of age, with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis was
   included in the study. The children, their parents, and the attending
   rheumatologist assessed the child's pain using the Abu-Saad pediatric
   pain assessment tool. Ln addition, a disease activity index was used by
   the physician. All children reported pain. This was most often described
   as hurting, stinging, warm, and uncomfortable. Significant correlations
   were found for present pain between the child, parent, and physician.
   The worst pain of the child for the previous week, and not the present
   pain, correlated with the disease activity as rated by the physician.
   These findings indicate a need for pain assessment in patients with

   referred to as segregated transport-sorption/solubilization (STSS),
   allows for interphase mass transfer at each time step after solute
   advection and dispersion have occurred. The overall capabilities of the
   STSS technique include modeling equilibrium or nonequilibrium transport
   of individual and multiple solutes with linear or nonlinear sorption
   isotherms. Application of this modeling approach is illustrated for the
   transport of a conservative tracer, a surfactant, a hydrophobic organic
   compound (HOC), and a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) mixture. The
   coupling of sorption modules for phenanthrene and surfactant is used to
   reasonably describe surfactant-enhanced flushing of sorbed phenanthrene
   from a sand column.}},

   experimental results obtained with the murine model may have predictive
   value for human Chagas' disease. Challenge of the H-2 congenic mouse
   strains A.SW (H-2(s)) and A.CA (H-2(f)) with Trypanosoma cruzi yields
   different results. The A.CA animals die approximately 12 days
   postinfection, while A.SW mice survive indefinitely. A 45-kD protein
   (Tc45), an antigen differentially recognized by the A.SW strain, is
   present in cultured epimastigotes and blood trypomastigotes. We describe
   here its purification from epimastigotes. The presence of Tc45 was
   monitored and a single band was detected. Since the molecular weights of
   Tc45, cruzipain, cruzain, and a 46-kD parasite polypeptide are similar,
   it was important to determine if these molecules are related. A complete

Abstract = {{Angiotensin (ANG) II is not only a potent vasoconstrictor but may also
   be involved in the regeneration of new blood vessels: In proliferative
   endometrium, ANG II-like immunoreactivity was detected in glandular
   epithelium and stroma with negligible staining around the vascular
   endothelium, In contrast, in secretory endometrium intense
   immunostaining was seen in the perivascular stromal cells around the
   endometrial spiral arterioles with negligible staining of the other cell
   types. Quantitative receptor autoradiography using the nonselective
   radioligand {[}I-125]-ANG II and subtype selective competing compounds
   showed that endometrium contained predominantly AT(2) receptors, with
   relatively low expression of AT(1) receptors and a novel
   non-AT(1)/non-AT(2) angiotensin II recognition site that was insensitive
   to AT(1) or AT(2) selective ligands, Levels of specific {[}I-125]-ANG II
   receptor binding displayed cyclic changes during the menstrual cycle,
   reaching a maximum in early secretory endometrium and then decreasing in
   mid to late secretory endometrium to levels seen in early to mid
   proliferative endometrium. In situ hybridization showed AT(1) receptor
   mRNA expression in the glands and in the endometrial blood vessels, The
   cyclic changes in ANG II-like immunoreactivity together with expression
   of both the known and the novel AT receptor subtypes imply that this
   octopeptide may play a dual role both in the control of the uterine
   vascular bed and also in the regeneration of the endometrium after
   endometrial shedding, acting as an angiogenic and mitogenic mediator.}},

Abstract = {{A direct spectrophotometric method for the determination of aluminium

   chelate which has an absorption maximum at 421nm. The average molar
   absorptivity and Sandell's sensitivity were found to be 5.3 x 10(3) l
   mol(-1) cm(-1) and 5 ng of Al cm(-2), respectively. The reaction is
   instantaneous and absorbance remains stable for 48 h. The colour system
   obeys Beer's law from IO ng ml(-1) to 5.0 mu g ml(-1) of Al; the
   stoichiometric composition of the chelate is 2:3 (Al:morin). The
   interference from over 50 cations, anions and complexing agents has been
   studied at 0.1 mu g ml(-1) of Al. The method was applied successfully to

   arising from tissues with low or no expression of rck/p54, such as

   function of lambda(2), in accordance to what is expected from Faraday
   rotation (Alissandrakis and Chiuderi Drago, 1944). Combining the
   measured period of the Faraday rotation with the observed deplacement of
   the depolarization line with respect to the photospheric neutral line,
   the height above the photosphere of the depolarization point and the
   value of the electron density and the magnetic field at this point are
   computed. Although the calculations are done in the very simplified

Abstract = {{In a previous paper, we reported that a chimeric toxin composed of the
   enzymatic domain of the Shiga toxin A polypeptide (StxAl) genetically
   fused to the human CD4 (hCD4) molecule selectively kills cells infected
   with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Although other
   hCD4-containing chimeras cytotoxic to HIV-infected cells have been
   developed, there is limited information regarding their receptor binding
   and internalization. Therefore, the goals of this study were to purify
   the StxA1-hCD4 fusion protein, identify the receptor(s), and investigate
   the cytosolic trafficking route used by the chimeric toxin. Sufficient
   quantities of the StxA1-hCD4 hybrid were isolated for this investigation
   by using the pET expression and purification system. Cos-1 cells were
   rendered sensitive to the StxA1-hCD4 chimera by transfection with the
   env gene, which encodes HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins. The entry and
   translocation pathway used by the StxA1-hCD4 hybrid toxin was
   investigated by assessing the protective capacities of chemical reagents
   which interfere with microfilament movement, acidification of endosomes,
   and the integrity df the Golgi apparatus. Our findings indicated that
   the chimera uses HIV-1 glycoprotein gp120, and perhaps gp41, as a
   receptor which directs its entry through receptor cycling. Uptake is pH
   independent, and the StxA1-hCD4 hybrid is apparently translocated to the
   Golgi complex as with other bipartite toxins.}},

   Potato cvs Agria, Bintje, Karnico, Kondor and Producent were transformed

   total, 49 independent transgenic potato clones were obtained, Northern
   blot analysis of these plants revealed that the introduced gene was
   transcribed to detectable levels in almost all plants, the highest
   transcription level being approximately 0.6\% of total mRNA. No cecropin
   B peptide could be detected in transgenic plants, probably as a result
   of rapid proteolytic degradation of newly synthesized cecropin B by
   potato endogenous proteases. Neither small tubers of a group of Il
   clones with moderate to high transcription levels nor slices from field
   grown tubers of any of the transgenic clones obtained, showed

   ANTIDYSRHYTMIC PROPERTIES}},

Abstract = {{Background: The use of propofol has been associated with episodes of
   bradycardias. The mechanism(s) underlying these phenomena are not well
   defined. Therefore we investigated (1) the chronotropic and dromotropic
   effects of propofol, (2) the frequency-dependent effects of propofol on
   the atrioventicular (AV) node, and (3) the physiologic mechanism(s)
   underlying propofol's effects on AV nodal conduction.
   Methods: Guinea pig isolated, perfused hearts were instrumented for
   measurement of atrial rate and AV nodal conduction time In spontaneously
   beating harts, or stimulus-to-His bundle (S-H) intervals in atrially
   paced hearts. In addition, the Wenckebach cycle length, effective
   refractory period and S-H interval prolongation to an abrupt increase in
   pacing rate were measured to further define propofol's dromotropic
   effects and frequency-dependent behavior.
   Results: Propofol, in a concentration-dependent manner, (1) slowed
   atrial rate and AV nodal conduction time in spontaneously beating
   hearts, (2) prolonged the S-H interval in atrially paced hearts, and (3)
   prolonged Wenckebach cycle length and effective refractory period. The
   negative dromotropic effect of propofol was greater during atrial pacing
   than in spontaneously beating hearts. Furthermore, this effect was
   enhanced at faster pacing rates, indicating frequency-dependent
   behavior. Atropine significantly antagonized propofol-induced S-H
   interval prolongation. The results of competition binding studies also
   supported a M(2)-muscarinic receptor-mediated mechanism.
   Conclusions: We conclude that in the Isolated guinea pig heart, propofol
   slows atrial rate and depresses AV nodal conduction in a
   concentration-dependent manner. The negative dromotropic effect of
   propofol shows frequency dependence and is predominantly mediated by
   M(2)-muscarinic receptors, Given the marked rate dependence of
   propofol's AV nodal actions, this anesthetic agent may impart
   antidysrhythmic protection to those patients susceptible to
   supraventricular tachycardias.}},

Abstract = {{Promotion of plant growth with plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria

   Induced disease suppression was observed after seed bacterization in a

   phaseolicola in greenhouse conditions, both in terms of symptom
   expression and bacterial viable counts in the leaves and in the
   intercellular washing fluids (IWF) from the leaves, Comparison of in
   vitro growth of' the pathogenic strain in IWF from protected and
   unprotected plants suggested that the inhibitory activity against
   pathogen establishment lies partly in the IWF of bacterized plants 10
   days after challenge inoculation. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
   revealed that the relative levels of proteins had increased in the leaf
   extracts of protected plants, A correlation was thus found between the
   reduction in symptom expression and a lower bacterial population in the
   leaves and a general rise in protein content in the IWF, Poor
   establishment of the test pathogen in the bean inoculated with PGPR
   strain Pseudomonas fluorescens, S97 may also involve accumulation of

Abstract = {{The heterodimeric alpha 4 integrins alpha 4 beta 7 lymphocyte Peyer's
   patch adhesion molecule ({[}LPAM]-1) and alpha 4 beta 1 (very late
   antigen-4) are cell surface adhesion molecules involved in lymphocyte
   trafficking and lymphocyte-cell and matrix interactions. Known cellular
   ligands include vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, which binds to
   alpha 4 beta 1 and alpha 4 beta 7, and the mucosal addressin cell
   adhesion molecule (MAdCAM)-1, which binds to alpha 4 beta 7. Here we
   show that the alpha 4 chain of these integrins can itself serve as a
   ligand. The alpha 4 chain, immunoaffinity purified and immobilized on
   glass slides, binds thymocytes and T lymphocytes. Binding exhibits
   divalent cation requirements and temperature sensitivity which are
   characteristic of integrin-mediated interactions, and is specifically
   inhibited by anti-alpha 4 integrin antibodies, which exert their effect
   at the cell surface. Cells expressing exclusively alpha 4 beta 7 (TK-1)
   or alpha 4 beta 1 (L1-2) both bound avidly, whereas alpha 4-negative
   cells did not. A soluble 34-kD alpha 4 chain fragment retained binding
   activity, and it inhibited lymphocyte adhesion to alpha 4 ligands. It
   has been shown that alpha 4 integrin binding to fibronectin involves an
   leucine-aspartic acid-valine (LDV) motif in the HepII/IIICS region of
   fibronectin (CS-1 peptide), and homologous sequences are important in
   binding to VCAM-1 and MAdCAM-1. Three conserved LDV motifs occur in the
   extracellular sequence of alpha 4. A synthetic LDV-containing alpha
   4-derived oligopeptide supports alpha 4-integrin-dependent lymphocyte
   adhesion and blocks binding to the 34-kD alpha 4 chain fragment. Our
   results suggest that alpha 4 beta 7 and alpha 4 beta 1 integrins may be
   able to bind to the alpha 4 subunit on adjacent cells, providing a novel
   mechanism for alpha 4 integrin-mediated and activation-regulated
   lymphocyte interactions during immune responses.}},

   clearly observed at the inoculation site 1 to 10 days p.i., and a large

   having different coarseness in the precipitate structure, were examined.
   By darkfield (DF) imaging, beta'' needles aligned in a {[}100] viewing
   direction were brought into contrast. Thickness was determined within 10
   pet using a spot contamination method. After subsequent corrections, the
   number density of precipitates could then be quantified, usually within
   5 pct. As expected, the average number density of the beta''
   precipitates correlates well with the material's tensile strength. A
   density of beta' was obtained by a similar method. The densities
   represent maximum values since precipitate-free areas are not
   considered. Tensile strength is quite sensitive to the ratio between the
   number densities of beta' and beta''. BY determining the volume of an
   average beta'' or beta' needle, corresponding volume fractions of the
   phases can be determined. Quantification of these phases could benefit
   calculations involving mechanical properties of such alloys.}},

Abstract = {{Reference values for hematologic variables change with increasing age in
   cattle. Therefore, the purpose of the study reported here was to
   describe the peri toneal fluid constitutents of clinically normal young
   calves, and to compare cellular concentration and distribution in blood
   and peritoneal fluid of young calves with those of adult cattle.
   Eight healthy 8-week-old male Holstein calves and 8 healthy 3- to
   8-year-old Holstein cows were studied. Peritoneal fluid was collected
   from calves along the ventral midline, 4-cm cranial to the umbilicus.
   Abdominocentesis was performed in the region of the lower right flank in
   adult cattle. Correlation analysis, using the Pearson's correlation
   coefficient, and regression analysis were performed for blood and
   peritoneal fluid data from calves. Data from calves were compared with
   those of cows, using Wilcoxon's rank sum test. A P value < 0.05 was
   considered significant for all tests.
   Calves had significantly lower blood eosinophil count (P < 0.003) and
   plasma protein concentration (P < 0.001) than did cows. Calves had
   significantly higher peritoneal fluid nucleated cell (P < 0.05) and
   mononuclear cell (P < 0.05) counts, but lower peritoneal fluid
   eosinophil cell count (P < 0.003) than did cows. For calves, nucleated
   cell and lyphocyte cell counts in the blood had a high, positive
   correlation with those of peritoneal fluid. However, the prediction
   equation for nucleated cell count accounted for a modest proportion of
   variability. A prediction equation for peritoneal fluid lymphocyte cell,
   count was established.
   On the basis of results of this study, reference ranges established for
   peritoneal fluid constituents of clinically normal adult cattle may not
   be appropriate for interpretation of peritoneal fluid analysis of
   calves.}},

Abstract = {{Humic and fulvic acids and other naturally derived organic compounds
   such as proteins and fatty acids are important constituents of soil
   solutions and surface waters and groundwater. The presence of both
   hydrophilic polar or ionic functional groups and hydrophobic structural
   units on these natural organic compounds can be expected to promote
   accumulation at the air-water interface, which would thereby influence
   the solution surface tension. This study evaluated the influence of
   organic C concentration, pH, and temperature on the surface tension of
   soil solutions extracted from forest soils and solutions of
   International Humic Substances Society (IHSS) reference humic acids. The
   surface tensions of the soil solutions were substantially lower than
   those of IHSS humic acids at equivalent organic C concentrations and
   solution conditions. Differences were also observed in the temperature
   dependence of surface tension for the solutions. All solutions exhibited
   a strong dependence of surface tension on solution pH. Characterization
   of the soil solutions and humic acid solutions by fluorescence and
   absorption spectroscopy and titration analysis confirmed that the soil
   solutions varied markedly from the humic acid solutions. The soil
   solutions bore substantially higher acidity and yielded qualitatively
   different fluorescence spectra when compared with the humic acid
   solutions under equivalent conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Gender differences in the effects of haloperidol (0.075 mg/kg per day
   for 5 days) on avoidance conditioning were evaluated. We also studied
   performance of the subjects free of the drug and the acute effects of
   haloperidol in animals trained without drug 48 h after the last
   haloperidol administration. Latencies of escape and avoidance responses,
   number of nonresponses, escapes, avoidances, crossings during the
   adaptation period, crossings during intertrial intervals, and total
   crossings per minute were analyzed. This dosage impaired conditioning of
   the male animals but did not attain the same effects on females.
   Haloperidol did not deteriorate performance of the task when it had been
   learned previously without drug. The results confirm the existence of
   gender differences in haloperidol effects on avoidance conditioning in
   mice and suggest that these differences are related to the learning
   process and not only to the impairment of motor behavior characteristic
   of neuroleptic drugs.}},

Abstract = {{Expression of an olfactory memory in Is-day-old rat pups was examined in
   eight experiments following brief manipulations of environmental
   conditions prior to a retention test. In the first experiment we found
   that retention was disrupted if a pup was placed in isolation for 3 hr
   prior to the retention test. The retention deficit persisted even when
   pups had 3-hr exposure to an anesthetized dam and siblings before
   testing. However, there was no defrcit in retention if pups spent the
   pretest interval with a nonlactating foster dam, their father, or
   littermates. Finally, we found that this deficit in retention could be
   alleviated by cuing treatments that preceded the retention test
   following isolation. Both discrete cues used during training and
   returning the pup to the home cage with parents and siblings for 3 hr
   were found to alleviate the retention deficit caused by isolation. These
   data demonstrate that housing conditions can influence postacquisition
   memory processes in the young animal.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of non-uniform He plasma on the properties of thin oxide
   (11.5-13 nm) metal-organic-semiconductor (MOS) structures has been
   investigated by means of C-V and breakdown-voltage histogram techniques.
   The plasma reactor system used is like a magnetically enhanced reactive
   ion etcher. The damage creation for MOS structures with various Al gate
   thicknesses were determined as a function of discharge parameters and
   plasma exposure time. The results show the vulnerability of the oxide
   and its interface with Si to the plasma process. The creation of a large
   amount of defects in the form of a fixed oxide charge and interface
   states is found; the build-up plasma damage process is very rapid,
   particularly during the first 5-30 s of the plasma exposure time and it
   depends essentially on the Al gate thickness (the thinner Al gate
   exhibits stronger plasma sensitivity). It is established that build-up
   damage depends on the plasma uniformity, but the non-uniformity is not
   the only nor the dominating factor. The nature of the process-induced
   defects and the influence of plasma components are also discussed.}},

   We present here a rigorous proof of the scaling relation P(s)
   proportional to s(1/2), s much less than 1, where P(s) is the cumulative
   probability distribution of shock strengths. We also show that the set
   of spatial locations of shocks is discrete, i.e. has no accumulation

   distribution, namely 1 - P(s) less than or equal to exp\{-Cs-3\} for s
   much greater than 1. Our method draws on a remarkable connection

Abstract = {{Dense barium metaplumbate (BaPbO3) (BPO) thin films with good metallic
   conduction have been produced by a metal-alkoxide method. Addition of a
   small amount of triethyleneglycol was effective to obtain smooth films.
   Thin films were deposited on either cleaved MgO(100) single crystal
   substrates (MgO (100)) or oxidized single crystal Si(100) wafers
   (SiO2/Si) by spin coating. Single-phase BPO films were obtained by
   firing at 500 degrees C in O-2 flow when a combination of
   Ba(OCH2CH2OCH3)(2), Pb(OCH2CH3)(2) and CH3CH2OH was used as the raw
   materials and solvent. Dense BPO thin films deposited on MgO(100) and
   SiO2/Si substrates had a room-temperature resistivity of about 2.6 and
   0.7 m Omega . cm, respectively, comparable to a typical value of 0.5m
   Omega . cm in bulk BPO ceramics produced by powder processing. The
   electrical property of the obtained films is indicative of their
   potential use as an electrode material for ferroelectric thin him
   devices.}},

Abstract = {{We have designed and implemented a simple yet powerful declarative
   synchronization mechanism for a parallel object-oriented computation
   model. The mechanism allows the user to control multiple message
   reception, specify the order of message reception, lock an invocation,
   and specify relations as invocation constraints. It has been included in
   a parallel object-oriented language, called A-NETL. The compiler and
   operating system have been developed on a total architecture, A-NET
   (Actors NETwork). The experimental results show that (i) the mechanism
   allows the user to model asynchronous events naturally, without losing
   the integrity of described programs; (ii) the replacement of the
   mechanism with the user's code requires tedious descriptions, but gains
   little performance enhancement, and certainly loses program readability
   and integrity; (iii) the mechanism allows the user to shift synchronous
   programs to asynchronous ones, with a scalable reduction of execution
   times: an average 20.6\% for 6 to 17 objects and 46.1\% for 65 objects.
   These prove the effectiveness of the proposed synchronization mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Arbutamine is a new, potent, short-acting synthetic catecholamine
   developed specifically for use as a cardiac stress agent, Previous
   reports on the accuracy of arbutamine fbr the detection of coronary
   artery disease have relied on heart rate (HR) increases similar to those
   seen at peak exercise, This study was undertaken to test the potential
   to provoke ischemic wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography using
   arbutamine at a HR below that associated with peak exercise, One hundred
   forty-six patients with coronary artery disease underwent computerized
   closed-loop stress testing with arbutamine 120 (82\%) had
   echocardiographic images adequate for analysis at baseline, low stress
   (20 beats/min above baseline), and peak stress (target of 85\%
   age-predicted peak HR). Ejection fraction increased from 59 +/- 10\% at
   baseline to 72 +/- 12\% at low stress, and remained stable at 72 +/-
   14\% at peak stress, Of 88 patients with echocardiographic evidence of
   ischemia at peak stress, 73 (83\%) had evidence of ischemia at low
   stress. Change in wall motion score index from baseline to low stress
   represented 62\% of the change noted from baseline to peak stress, A
   greater number of stenotic vessels were associated with a somewhat
   higher proportion of ischemic responses evident at low stress, The
   present study suggests that the maximal inotropic effects of arbutamine
   may occur at a dose lower than that required for maximal chronotropic
   effect, In the future, it may be possible to establish an infusion end
   point for arbutamine stress testing using a HR <85\% of the
   age-predicted maximum.}},

Abstract = {{On nickel single crystals exhibiting (111), (110), and vicinal (110)
   surfaces, carbon or sulfur adsorbate layers have been produced under UHV
   conditions by annealing either purified samples in ethylene (6.7 x
   10(-4) Pa, 663-1000 K) or samples containing 5-7 ppm S in UHV at
   823-1123 K. The adsorbate-covered surfaces were analysed by Auger
   electron spectroscopy (AES) and imaged by scanning tunneling microscopy
   (STM). The adsorption of carbon on Ni(111) via ethylene dissociation was
   found to result in the epitaxial growth of a graphite monolayer.
   However, in the STM image, only three of six carbon atoms in the
   two-dimensional graphite lattice appear. In the case of the stepped
   vicinal to Ni(110) surface Ni(771), carbon adsorption leads to the
   formation of uniformly distributed carbon islands with diameters between
   30 and 100 Angstrom, but resolution of the structure on an atomic scale
   could not be achieved. Owing to sulfur segregation on Ni(111) at 823 K
   and approximately 0.2 ML (average value), a surface structure develops,
   which can be ascribed to the formation of a two-dimensional sulfide Ni2S
   involving surface reconstruction of the nickel substrate. On Nit? ?Oi,
   sulfur segregation at 1043 K results in the growth of sulfur islands
   that exhibit at 0. 4 ML a c(2 x 2)-S overlayer structure.}},

Abstract = {{We present and analyze algorithms for the incremental computation of
   time-varying queries in which selection predicates refer to the state of
   a clock. Such queries occur naturally in many situations where temporal
   data are processed. Incremental techniques for query computation have
   proven to be more efficient than other techniques in many situations.
   However, all existing incremental techniques for query computation
   assume that old query results remain valid if no intermediate changes
   are made to the underlying database. Unfortunately, this assumption does
   not hold for time-varying queries whose results may change just because
   time passes. In order to solve this problem, we introduce the notion of
   a superview which contains all current tuples that will eventually
   satisfy the selection predicate of a time varying selection. Based on
   the notion of superview, we develop efficient algorithms for the
   incremental computation of time varying selections. Our algorithms,
   combined with existing incremental algorithms, allow complex
   time-varying queries to benefit from the proven efficiency of
   incremental techniques. It is important to notice that without our
   algorithms, the existing algorithms for incremental computation would be
   useless for any time-varying query expression.}},

Abstract = {{Bisphosphonates have been synthesised during the past 30 years in
   analogy to pyrophosphate. Inhibiting bone destruction diseases causing
   an osteoclastic bone resorption, bisphosphonates gain increasing
   importance in the treatment of osteolytic lesions in tumor patients. The
   basic chemical structure is highly responsible for their remarkable
   affinity to the bone. The resulting biological effect of the various
   derivatives, however, depends on the two substitutents attached to the
   central carbonic group. Therefore every single bisphosphonate
   demonstrates its own specific chemical, physical, biological and
   therapeutical properties. The `'coupling'' of bone resorption and
   remodeling is in need of a complex interaction of many different
   factors. Known coupling signals of osteoclasts and osteoblasts are
   mainly TGF-beta, prostaglandine-E2 and IL-1. The osteoclast-activating
   factor (OAF) is related to a number of cytokines as IL-1, TNF-alpha and
   TNF-beta, being able to stimulate the generation and stimulation of new
   as well as to activate preformed and mature osteoclasts. Cytokines, in
   return, stimulate the production of prostaglandines representing as bone
   resorbing factors themselves. Bone matrix factors stimulate the
   liberation of IL-1 from monocytes in a dose dependent mechanism. After
   treatment with bisphosphonates this effect is diminished as a result of
   a reduced binding capacity of the monocytes. However, initially many
   bisphosphonates lead to a stimulation of collagenase and PGE(2) in
   chondrocytes meaning an enhancement of the IL-1 effect with transient
   protein shift expressing an acute phase reaction combined with fever and
   reduction of circulating lymphocytes after the first application. After
   further repetitions of bisphosphonate application these effects cease to
   occur, signifying that the effect is limited in time. The inhibiting
   power of a number of bisphosphonates leads to a specific decrease in
   macrophage proliferation and migration not affecting other cell lines
   such as granulocytes. Moreover, some bisphosphonates are able to cause a
   retardation of macrophage-dependent lymphocyte proliferation. As another
   example, a reduction in thymic maturation and an imbalance of T-cell
   function when applying bisphosphonates has been obseved. Scientific
   research in recent years demonstrated that at the level of cellular
   compounds bisphosphonates lead to complex changes in bone metabolism.
   Besides the individually quite variable mode of action of each distinct
   bisphosphonate time-dependent phenomena, the locally achievable
   concentrations are also of outstanding importance. The diversity in
   character and performance of these compounds should not handicap further
   clinical trials. On the contrary, such a great variety opens up new
   chances to discover numerous facilities in the application of these very
   interesting bisphosphonate compounds.}},

Abstract = {{Perceptions of sexual harassment were investigated as a function of
   perpetrators' and recipients' gender. Undergraduate students (100 women,

   work. Participants were asked to read carefully each scenario and
   indicate on a scale anchored by 1 (strongly disagree) and 7 (strongly
   agree) their opinions as to whether the scenario represented an incident
   of sexual harassment. Analysis indicated that women rated `'hostile
   environment'' scenarios as more harassing than men, and male
   perpetrators were rated as mote harassing than female perpetrators. Even
   though some scenarios were rated as mote harassing than others, the full
   range of the 7-point scale was used on every scenario, indicating a lack
   of agreement on what constitutes harassment. This lack of agreement
   highlights the debate within the legal community about whether the
   `'reasonable person'' or the `'reasonable woman'' standard should be
   used to judge sexual harassment in the workplace.}},

Abstract = {{The paper describes the concept of a network model for the morphological
   behaviour of a near-resonant multiple-inlet tidal basin, as part of a
   model system which includes the barrier island coasts and the outer
   deltas. It addresses the question whether a small interference somewhere
   in such a basin can have major effects on sediment transport and
   morphology elsewhere in the system.
   In order to explain the basic ideas of the model, only the main tidal
   constituent (M(2)) and the associated topography-induced residual
   current are considered, not the overtides. Furthermore, the model
   concerns only non-cohesive sediment (sand).
   In spite of these simplifications, the model concept is shown to be
   effective, in that it results in a morphological evolution equation for
   each branch of the network and a picture of the influence of each branch
   on the resonance-sensitivity of the system as a whole.}},

Abstract = {{With the advent of preoperative radiotherapy for pancreas cancers, their
   measurement by imaging is rendered more important, so that outcome data
   from various treatment programs may be compared. Two radiologists have
   examined tumor size measurements from 29 patients by CT scans obtained
   within a week of measurement in the Pathology Department after
   resection. The radiologists assessed these scans independently from one
   another and blinded from the pathologic measurement. The largest
   diameter of their readings was compared to the largest diameter of the
   tumor measured by the Pathology technician. The correlation between
   radiologists (P < 3 x 10(-8) was excellent, Correlation between the
   average of the two radiologic estimates of greatest tumor diameter and
   actual tissue measurement is excellent for tumors (n = 21) greater than
   2 and less than 5 cm in diameter (P < 0.03), but of four specimens
   measured in the Pathology laboratory as less than 2 cm, all were
   measured by the radiologists as being at least 1.5 cm larger. Twenty of
   the 29 cancers (69\%) were measured by two radiologists to be within 1
   cm of the actual diameter. The nine specimens producing the greatest
   errors were two with diffuse mucinous tumors throughout the gland
   (radiologists undercalled by 2.5 cm), one 7 cm mass with a cystic center
   composed of necrotic cells (overcalled by 2.5 em, perhaps because of
   deformity or release of fluid in Pathology), four small masses (1, 1.5,
   1.5, and 1.5 cm in diameter), smaller than the normal diameter of the
   pancreas head, and two tumors with inexplicably inaccurate size
   estimates. Of the nine cases with errors of at least 2 cm by at least
   one radiologist, six were measured as larger than actual. Current
   techniques are reasonably accurate for tumors >2 cm in diameter. Spiral
   and thin-section CT scanning with bolus enhancement will probably
   further improve the radiologist's estimate of pancreas tumor size,
   particularly of T1 cancers.}},

Abstract = {{Oxygen uptake (VO2) and carbon dioxide elimination (VCO2) can be
   measured with an indirect calorimeter; this method is well established
   in routine monitoring of ICU patients to evaluate metabolic state as a
   reflection of stress. In various experimental studies it was
   demonstrated that anaesthetics can influence whole-body metabolism. The
   purpose of this study was to examine whether indirect calorimetry can be
   used intraoperatively during routine anaesthesia and whether presumable
   changes in metabolism can be detected immediately. Abdominal aortic
   cross-clamping changes circulation, nutritional supply of the lower
   extremities and thus VO2 and VCO2. We therefore used this operation for
   our study.
   Method. Eleven patients, mean age 64 years, undergoing reconstruction of
   the aortic bifurcation, were studied. After premedication with
   piritramid and atropine, total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) was
   per-formed with fentanyl and midazolam after an induction with
   thiopental. Patients were ventilated with a Servo-Ventilator 900 D and a
   constant FiO2 of 0.5, without N2O. Routine monitoring consisted of ECG,
   pulsoximetry, CVP and continuous AP. VO2 and VCO2 were measured with a
   Deltatrac(R) (Datex), and data were registered every minute. For
   statistical evaluation we used a Wilcoxon-Ranksum test for matched
   pairs, p < 0.05 was considered significant. Data from specific time (5
   min after intubation, 5 min before clamping; 5, 10 and 15 min after
   clamping, before declamping and 5 and 10 min after declamping and at the
   end of surgery) were calculated. In addition to absolute values, we
   compared the measured VO2 and VCO2 to baseline (5 min before clamping =
   MP2).
   Results. Mean operating time was 139 min+/-37; aortic cross-clamping
   time for the first extremity was 38 min and 55 min for the second. As
   expected, there was a significant decrease in VO2 (90\% of baseline) and
   VCO2 (75\% of baseline) during aortic cross-clamping. After declamping
   VO2 again rose to 110\% of baseline, or to 103\% for the second limb.
   VCO2 increased to only 90\% and 82\%, respectively. At the end of
   surgery VO2 reached baseline, whereas VCO2 remains at 83\%. The
   respiratory quotient VCO2: VO2 was markedly reduced from 0.95+/-0.156 to
   0.73+/-0.06 during surgery. The Deltatrac(R) showed every change in VO2
   without delay; changes in VCO2 seem to occur somewhat retarded.
   Discussion. Aortic cross-clamping leads to a marked decrease in VO2 and
   VCO2 reflecting the temporary reduction in whole-body metabolism.
   Declamping results in a compensatory rise, especially in VO2. VCO2 seems
   to increase less after declamping, perhaps due to the CO2 pool of the
   organism or to a change in metabolism from carbohydrate to mainly fat
   oxidation.
   The results of this study demonstrate that indirect calorimetry can
   easily be performed during anaesthesia and surgery. Preconditions are a
   non-rebreathing system without airleak, constant FiO(2) < 0.6 and no use
   of nitrous oxide.}},

   isolates were studied with buffered yeast extract (BYE) broth (inoculum,
   10(5) CFU/ml). The MICs inhibiting 90\% of strains tested on BCYE agar
   were 0.125, 0.25, 1.0, and less than or equal to 0.004 mu g/ml for
   levofloxacin, ofloxacin, erythromycin, and rifampin, respectively. The
   MICs by the BYE broth dilution method were 1 to 3, 2, 1 to 2, and 1 tube
   lower than those by the agar dilution method for levofloxacin,
   ofloxacin, erythromycin, and rifampin, respectively. The MBCs were 1 to
   2 tubes higher than the broth dilution MICs for levofloxacin, 1 to 3
   tubes higher than the broth dilution MICs for ofloxacin, 1 to 3 tubes
   higher than the broth dilution MICs for erythromycin, and the same as
   the broth dilution MICs for rifampin. In kinetic time-kill curve
   studies, at drug concentrations of 1.0 and 2.0 times the MIG, the most
   active drugs were levofloxacin and rifampin. At 72 h, concentrations of
   levofloxacin and rifampin of 2.0 times the MIC demonstrated a
   bactericidal effect against L. pneumophila. In contrast, at
   concentrations of 1.0 and 2.0 times the MICs regrowth was observed with
   ofloxacin and only a gradual decrease in the numbers of CFU per
   milliliter mas observed with erythromycin. Only a minor inhibitory
   effect was observed with 0.25 or 0.5 time the MICs of all drugs at 24 to
   48 h, with regrowth occurring at 72 h. In kinetic time-kill curve
   studies, combinations of levofloxacin plus rifampin, ofloxacin plus
   rifampin, and erythromycin plus rifampin at 72 h demonstrated synergy at
   0.5 time the MICs of each drug. However, at these concentrations only
   levofloxacin plus rifampin demonstrated a synergistic bactericidal
   effect against L. pneumophila at 72 h. In contrast to erythromycin or
   ofloxacin plus rifampin at 0.25 time the MICs, only levofloxacin plus
   rifampin demonstrated synergy. Thus, levofloxacin demonstrated the best
   inhibitory and bactericidal effects against L. pneumophila when it was
   studied alone or in a combination with rifampin.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a method for on-line weld geometry monitoring and
   control using a single front-side infrared sensor. Variations in plate
   thickness, shielding gas composition and minor element content are known
   to cause weld geometry changes. These changes in the weld geometry can
   be distinctly detected from an analysis of temperature gradients
   computed from infrared data. Deviations in temperature gradients were
   used to control the bead width and depth of penetration during the
   welding process. The analytical techniques described in this paper have
   been used to control gas tungsten are and gas metal are welding

Abstract = {{The authors report the setup of direct, competitive ELISA tests for
   determination of Fusarium mycotoxins (T-2 and F-2) based on monoclonal
   antibodies, They analyzed the preparation of T-2- and F-2-peroxidase
   conjugates and optimalized the test's conditions (Fig, 2). The tests
   were validated and analyzed by important data e:g. specificity,
   sensitivity (Table I), reproducibility (Table 2) and accuracy (Table 3).
   The ELISA tests were applied for quantitative determination of
   mycotoxins in different cereals in food and feedstuffs. Among the
   several extraction solvents tried, the 89 part acetonitril/10 part 0.5\%
   KCl/1 part 6\% sulphuric acid were chosen. The extracts can be used
   without further cleanup in the ELISA test. With appropriate dilution of
   the sample supernatants (1 :25, 1 :50), the matrix effects caused by
   lipid, colour, protein content and organic solvents (less than or equal
   to 10\%) could be diminished to a low level (Fig. 3). The mean
   recoveries from cereals infected with 100-2000 ng/g T-2 and 50-500 ng/g
   F-2 were 85\% and 91\%, respectively (Table 4 and 5).
   Detection limit for T-2 is 50 ng/g, that of F-2 is 25 ng/g.
   The reported reagent kits, named Toxiklon T-2 and Toxiklon Zearalenone
   have been commercialized. The kits are flexible and by the use of strip
   format microplates, individual samples in different time can also be
   determined. In order to introduce the system into the agricultural
   practice several lectures and collaborative studies were organized for
   both toxins in Hungary:
   These kits are offered mainly for official government laboratories for
   quick and quantitative analysis of T-2 and F-2 toxins, instead of
   qualitative thin-layer chromatography in cereals.}},

Abstract = {{The author discusses some assumptions that are taken for granted when
   considering the discontent felt in Latin America with its
   psychoanalytical thinking, which is often characterised as the result of
   a colonised mentality which leads to imitation of European, especially
   British, ideas. The author criticises this explanation based on she
   opposition between the culture of the coloniser and the culture of the
   colonised. The author suggests that we start from another perspective,
   believing that the discontent which afflicts many Latin American
   analysts can be better understood by an analysis of how consumer
   societies treat knowledge that originates elsewhere. Consumer societies
   tend ruthlessly to simplify academic knowledge, rapidly transforming it
   into routine techniques ready for consumption. This treatment dislodges
   the knowledge from the conceptual schemes which generated it and which
   served as its source of inspiration. In this context certain consumer
   groups become owners of certain psychoanalytic ideas, simplified by the
   veri? use to which they are put. When ideas and theories become
   simplifications, mere techniques to be applied, they may be used to
   institutionalise and legitimate the domination of certain groups within
   local Psychoanalytic Societies. In this situation the remaining sectors
   of the local societies tend to treat these ideas as exotic and alien to
   their environment and the dominating groups foster the notion that it is
   the original, foreign power that is to blame for the colonising
   dominance of its ideas. In other cases, however, foreign ideas may be
   carefully studied, criticised and used creatively to develop new ways of
   thinking.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Citric acid clearance from the oral cavity may be an
   important factor in the erosion of dental enamel. The aim of the present
   study was to investigate the clearance pattern of citric acid in normal
   subjects.
   Methods: After determination of the unstimulated salivary flow rate and
   the residual volume of saliva after normal swallowing, 12 subjects
   rinsed with 95.2 mmol l(-1) citric acid for 5 s. At 1, 2, 5, 10 and 15
   min after the rinse a small saliva sample was collected and the
   concentration of citric acid was determined enzymatically. For each
   subject three separate experiments on different occasions were performed
   with a citric acid solution of pH 2.1 and one experiment with a solution
   of pH 4.5.
   Results: The salivary citric acid concentration declined biphasically:
   rapidly during the first 2 min, then more slowly. The elimination rate
   over the first minute was on average 87.7 mmol l(-1) min(-1) at pH 2.1
   compared with 85.0 mmol l(-1) min(-1) at pH 4.5. The difference between
   individuals estimated from the areas under the clearance curve was
   strongly significant (P < 0.001). No significant relation was found
   neither between salivary flow rate and clearance, nor between residual
   volume after swallowing and clearance.
   Conclusion: The clearance pattern of citric acid is an individual
   property.}},

Abstract = {{The principal objective of this study was to determine if the use of a

   human nutrition. It has been studied at the Missouri University Research
   Reactor (MURR) for the past 15 years using an Instrumental Neutron
   Activation Analysis (INAA) technique. The principal route of human
   exposure to selenium is through the diet. Selenium concentrations of
   nails, blood, hair, and urine have been used as indicators of dietary
   selenium intake. In this study, a cohort consisting of seven men and
   five women ingested three selenium supplements of 150 mu g each over a
   three day period. The selenium was enriched in Se-76 (96.48\%) and
   ingested as selenite in orange juice following an overnight fast.
   Fingernails and toenails were collected prior to the selenium
   supplementation and for several months afterward to be used as
   biochemical indicators. The peak Se-76 concentration in the fingernails
   and toenails occurred at 19-23 and 16-32 weeks after supplementation,

   for 5-hydroxytryptamine (citalopram, paroxetine) differ from those for
   the uptake system for noradrenaline (normetanephrine,

   but with properties inconsistent with competition for the same uptake
   system while noradrenaline does not inhibit 5-hydroxytryptamine uptake.

Abstract = {{In stationary heat-loss experiments, the thermal losses by gas
   conduction of an evacuated flat-plate solar collector (EFPC) were
   experimentally determined for different values of interior gas pressure.
   The experiments were carried out with air and argon in the pressure
   range from 10(-3) to 10(4) Pa. For air, loss reduction sets in at 100
   Pa, whereas at 0.1 Pa hear conduction is almost completely suppressed.
   Using argon as filling gas, gas conduction is reduced by 30 percent
   (compared to air) at moderate interior pressures of 1000 Pa. With
   decreasing pressure this reduction is even greater (50 percent reduction
   at 10 Pa). A theory was developed to calculate thermal losses by gas
   conduction in an EFPC: Fourier's stationary heat conduction equation was
   solved numerically (method of finite differences)for the special
   geometry of the collector. From kinetic gas theory a formula for the
   pressure dependency of the thermal conductivity was derived covering the
   entire pressure range. The theory has been validated experimentally for
   the gases air and argon. Calculations for krypton and xenon show a
   possible gas conduction loss reduction of 60-70 percent and 75-85
   percent (with respect to air, depending on gas pressure), corresponding
   to a reduction of the overall collector losses of up to 40 percent.}},

Abstract = {{Exposure of mice to midrange UV radiation (UVB) (280-320 mm) in vivo
   leads to suppression of the ability to induce delayed-type
   hypersensitivity (DTH), Systemic administration of supernatants from UVB
   exposed keratinocytes (KC) similarly inhibits the ability to induce DTH
   and the presence of interleukin-10 (IL-10) in the supernatants has been
   shown to be responsible for this effect. It has been hypothesized that
   release of IL-10 by KC after exposure to UVB radiation in vivo may be
   responsible for UVB-induced inhibition of DTH and also for the inability
   of chronically UVB-irradiated mice to immunologically reject immunogenic
   UVB-induced skin tumors, To test directly whether supernatants from
   UVB-irradiated KC can inhibit presentation of tumor-associated antigens
   (TAA) by epidermal Langerhans cells (LC), cultures of the transformed
   murine KC line PAM 212 were exposed to 200 J/m(2) of UVB radiation and
   24 h supernatants obtained, CAF(1) (H-2(a/d)) epidermal cells (EC)
   enriched for LC content were exposed to supernatants from irradiated
   (UV-SN) or mock-irradiated (MI-SN) PAM 212 cells for 3 h followed by
   culture for 16 h in granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and
   then were pulsed with soluble TAA derived from the murine spindle cell
   tumor S1509a (H-2(a)). ECs were then washed and injected subcutaneously
   into naive CAF(1) mice three times at weekly intervals for priming, One
   week after the final immunization these mice were challenged
   subcutaneously with live S1509(a) cells and tumor growth scored over
   time, Pretreatment of EC with UV-SN but not MI-SN inhibited the
   induction of effective immunity by this immunization scheme, ECs were
   also treated with UV-SN or MI-SN for 3 h then pulsed with TAA and
   injected into a hind footpad of previously immunized mice for
   elicitation of a DTH response, Pretreatment of EC with UV-SN but not
   MI-SN inhibited the ability of EC to elicit DTH. Neutralization studies
   with specific neutralizing antibodies to IL-10 demonstrated that the
   presence of IL-10 in UV-SN was responsible for the inhibition of antigen
   presentation both for induction and elicitation of immunity, UV-SN
   inhibits tumor antigen presentation by epidermal LC through the action
   of IL-10.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of periodic environmental fluctuations on population
   viability are examined based on the use of environmental states. The
   approach is applied to the Florida population of the Snail Kite, an
   endangered wetland hawk that feeds almost solely on one species of
   snail. A preliminary assessment based on stochastic population
   fluctuations indicated that populations became viable when initial size
   surpassed 300 individuals. However, changes in population size between
   consecutive years, nesting success, and the length of the breeding
   season were all highly and positively related to water level and
   rainfall characteristics, which are highly periodic. Low water
   conditions cause Snail Kites to disperse and result in low recruitment,
   increased adult mortality, and population declines. The effects of
   cyclic drought were explored using stage-based life tables for three
   different water conditions or environmental states (drought, lag years
   following drought, and high years). Population sizes predicted by the
   model were closely associated with actual kite population counts.
   Deterministic projections indicated that kite populations would increase
   when intervals between droughts exceeded 3.3 yr, but stochastic
   simulations found that populations did not become viable unless
   intervals exceeded 4.3 yr. The model was sensitive to estimates of
   survivorship. The use of the environmental state approach is compared to
   standard techniques for population viability analyses (PVA), and the
   implications of the model for Everglades water management are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The bacterial superantigen, staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) activates
   T cells with high frequency and directs them to lyse
   MHC-class-II-expressing cells in superantigen-dependent cell-mediated
   cytotoxicity (SDCC). Treatment of mice with SEA induced strong CD8(+)
   T-cell(CTL)-mediated SDCC, as well as abundant cytokine production from
   CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. However, both cytotoxicity and cytokine
   release were transient. In contrast, combined treatment with SEA and
   recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) increased peak levels and maintained
   CTL activity. These effects were concomitant with an increased number of
   SEA-reactive V(beta)11(+) T cells. Both the CD4(+) and CD8(+)
   populations contained higher frequencies of cells expressing IL-2
   receptor (IL-2R) alpha beta, which suggests that continuous IL-2R
   signaling preserves its high expression and subsequently prevents loss
   of growth factor signals necessary for expansion of T cells. Although
   IL-2R expression was increased among both CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells, only
   the cytotoxic function of CTL, but not cytokine production from either
   CD4 or CD8, was augmented. These findings demonstrate that treatment
   with rIL-2 potentiates superantigen-induced cytotoxicity and maintains
   high CTL activity. rIL-2 might therefore be useful in improving
   superantigen-based tumor therapy.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: This 10-year review of in situ saphenous vein bypass surgery
   was undertaken to assess the impact of gender on infrainguinal arterial
   reconstruction.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: From March 1983 to March 1993, the results of 244
   in situ saphenous vein bypasses performed in women were compared with
   338 performed in men. Women were older than men (78.9 versus 66.8 years;
   P < 0.001) and had a higher incidence of hypertension but a lower
   incidence of coronary artery disease, smoking history, and chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease. The primary indication for surgery was
   limb salvage for both genders (women 70.1\%, men 68\%; P = not
   significant {[}NS]). Men had bypasses to more-distal outflow vessels,
   with 52.5\% to the tibial level compared with 42.2\% of women (P <
   0.003).
   RESULTS: Women had lower perioperative mortality rates than men (0.8\%
   versus 3.3\%; P < 0.025) and a similar incidence of major complications
   (6.6\% versus 7.7\%; P = NS), but a higher incidence of significant
   wound complications (13.5\% versus 3.3\%; P < 0.001). Life-table
   evaluation at 10 years after surgery showed no significant differences
   between women and men in primary graft patency rate (67.8\% versus
   58.2\%; P = NS), secondary patency rate (73.5\% versus 77;2\%; P = NS),
   limb salvage rate (87.9\% versus 92\%; P = NS) or patient survival rate
   (35.5\% versus 24.4\%; P = NS). For bypasses to the tibial arteries,
   graft patency rates were slightly inferior for women (69.8\% versus
   81.1\%, 5-year secondary patency rate; P < 0.008). Similarly, in
   bypasses performed for limb salvage, women had lower 5-year primary
   patency rates than men (60.3\% versus 70.3\%; P < 0.002). Secondary
   patency rates in this limb salvage group however, did non differ (75.5\%
   versus 82.8\%; P = NS)
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite small gender differences in the results of in situ
   bypass grafts for limb salvage and those carried to the tibial level,
   women had the same overall patency, limb salvage, and survival rates as
   men after infrainguinal bypass surgery Treatment of infrainguinal
   occlusive disease should not vary based on inaccurate perceptions
   concerning differences in surgical results for men and women.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. Children with sex chromosome abnormalities (SCA) are known
   to be at increased risk for neuromotor, language, learning, and
   behavioral problems, but little is known of psychosocial adaptation of
   SCA adolescents. This study was conducted to evaluate psychologic
   characteristics of unselected SCA adolescents, including socialization,
   educational progress, separation from family, and incidence and severity
   of psychiatric disturbance.
   Methods. Thirty-nine propositi identified through the screening of 40
   000 consecutive Denver newborns, including boys with 47,XXY karyotypes
   and girls with 47,XXX, 45,X, and partial X monosomy, or SCA mosaic
   karyotypes, have been followed longitudinally into adolescence.
   Twenty-seven siblings served as controls. Between 12 and 19 years of
   age, all participated in blind psychiatric interviews and were
   administered standardized intelligence and achievement tests.
   Results. SCA propositi demonstrated a mean IQ score 21 points lower than
   that of control subjects. In addition, lower mean scores were seen on
   achievement test results as well as lower overall psychosocial
   adaptation scores and increased incidence of psychiatric disturbance.
   Depression was the most frequent psychiatric diagnosis. Propositi were
   more likely to receive special education assistance in high school and
   were less likely to graduate from high school than were controls. Of the
   three nonmosaic propositi groups, the 47,XXX girls demonstrated the
   poorest overall psychosocial adaptation and highest degree of
   psychiatric disturbance. Mosaic girls were indistinguishable from
   control subjects. Marked variability was found among all three nonmosaic
   groups, with some individuals in each group demonstrating relatively
   strong psychosocial adaptation.
   Conclusions. The presence of nonmosaic sex chromosome abnormality
   increases the risk for impeded cognitive skills, learning abilities, and
   psychosocial adaptation in adolescence. The factors that allow for
   stronger adaptation in some of these adolescents include the presence of
   a stable and supportive family environment. The outlook for adaptation
   in unselected SCA adults remains uncertain.}},

Abstract = {{A migration algorithm appropriate for moderately varying lateral
   velocity changes is developed as an extension of phase-shift migration
   by using a variable-length spatial transform. This process significantly
   reduces the number of lateral wavenumbers necessary to downward continue
   the data, and it replaces the spatial FFT with a simple recursion
   relationship. For a given frequency and position x, ten lateral
   wavenumbers are typically sufficient, and the migration algorithm
   produces accurate images when the velocity structure v(x, z) changes
   over a few depth intervals of thickness Delta z, with lateral velocity
   gradients up to 1.4 to 1.0.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},

Volume = {{52}},

Abstract = {{The time correlation functions (CF's) of diagonal and off-diagonal
   components of the stress tenser of water have been calculated at 245 and
   298 K in a molecular dynamics (MD) study on 343 molecules in the
   microcanonical ensemble. We present results obtained at wave number k =
   0 and at a few finite. values of k, in the atomic and molecular
   formalism. In all cases; more than 98\% of these functions are due to
   the potential term of the stress tenser. At k = 0, their main features
   are a fast oscillatory initial decay, followed by a long-time tail more
   apparent in the supercooled region. Bulk and shear viscosities,
   calculated via Green-Kubo integration of the relevant CF at k = 0, are
   underestimated with respect to experimental data, mainly at low
   temperature, but their ratio (approximate to 2)is correctly reproduced.
   Both shear and bulk viscosity decrease as a function of k, the latter
   more rapidly, so that they become almost equal at approximate to 1
   Angstrom(-1) Also, both viscosities drop rapidly from their maximum at
   omega = 0. This behavior has been related to the large narrowing
   observed in the acoustic band, mainly in the supercooled region. The
   infinite frequency bulk and shear rigidity moduli have been shown to be
   in fair agreement with the experimental data, provided the MD value used
   for comparison is that corresponding to the frequency range relevant to
   ultrasonic measurements. The MD results of stress-stress CF's compare
   well with those predicted by Bertolini and Tani {[}Phys. Rev. E 51, 1091
   (1995)] at k = 0, by an application of generalized hydrodynamics {[}de
   Schepper et al., Phys. Rev. A 38, 271 1988)] in the molecular formalism,
   to the same model of water (TIP4P) {[}Jorgensen et al., J. Chem. Phys.
   79, 926 (1983)]. These CF's are essentially equal in the: atomic and
   molecular formalism, the only minor difference being restricted to the
   high frequency librational region of the shear function. By a comparison
   of atomic and molecular results, we show here that neglecting libration
   has no effect on the density-density and longitudinal current CF's and
   very little effect on transverse properties. On the other hand, this
   study points out the importance of including the oscillation in the
   nearest-neighbor cage in the memory function of the longitudinal and
   transverse current CF. The oscillatory local motion turns out to play an
   important role in all CF's and hence contributes significantly to the
   value of viscosity and of rigidity moduli.}},

Abstract = {{Neutron diffraction on powder samples can now be performed by
   time-of-flight methods above 25 GPa. The patterns are obtained in a few
   hours and yield interatomic distances with a precision of a few
   thousandths of an angstrom.
   For this, the Paris-Edinburgh cells are used, at the Test and Polaris
   stations of the ISIS Facility (UK). The procedures for the generation
   and characterization of pressure are described, as well as the methods
   for loading fluid samples, and the performance of the cell at low
   temperature.
   The quality of the data depends critically on adequate collimation and
   shielding of the beams, as well as on the efficiency of the detectors.
   Precise attenuation corrections must be applied to the raw data, prior
   to profile refinement procedures, in order to obtain significant
   structural information and thermal parameters.
   Results obtained by time-of-flight methods under different experimental
   conditions are reviewed. The use of the cell for inelastic scattering
   measurements at a reactor source in angular dispersion is described. The
   shift of a phonon mode of a single crystal under pressure has thus been
   measured up to 7 GPa.
   Prospects are discussed for extending these measurements to a wider

   lentils were generally similar; the major components of the seed coats

Abstract = {{The crystallization and fractal formation in a-Ge/Au have been studied
   by in situ TEM and HREM. It was demonstrated that both the
   crystallization and the fractal formation depend on the continuity of
   the Au underlayer and the thickness of the a-Ge layer, As the Au film
   changed from semicontinuous to discontinuous, the crystallization
   temperature increased and the morphology of the Ge crystallites changed
   from fractal to non-fractal. Both the dimension and the growth rate of
   Ge fractal increased with an increase in the thickness of a-Ge layer.
   The Au grain boundaries at the interface between the Au and a-Ge layers
   were suggested to be the nucleation sites for Ge grains, which caused a
   great reduction in the crystallization temperature, It was observed that
   the growth of Ge was closely related to the receding of Au grains.
   Kinetic study showed that the crystallization process was
   two-dimensional diffusion-controlled growth with nucleation. HREM study
   showed that the nucleation and growth of new Ge grains could change the
   direction of the branch and cause splitting of the tip of the fractals.
   The formation of fractal was explained by random successive nucleation
   and growth process, where growth is predominant over nucleation. The
   {[}110] or {[}211] direction was found to be the preferred growth
   direction of Ge grains and the Au {[}11O]//Ge {[}110], Au (001)//Ge (1
   (1) over bar 0) orientation relationship was suggested to be preferred
   between Au and Ge grains.}},

Title = {{ANALYTICAL METHODS FOR THE CHARACTERIZATION OF SANITATION PRODUCT
   RESIDUES ON WORKING SURFACES IN THE MEAT INDUSTRY}},

Abstract = {{Various methods of analysis to prove residual contamination of working
   areas in meat production companies with cleaning and disinfection agents
   were examined.  Due to constant monitoring of these agents the
   contamination of meat products was able to be prevented or at least
   minimised already during the initial hygiene control.  In solutions
   chemical methods based on color reaction were very vague so that a
   quantification was not possible.  One of the colorimetric photometry
   methods for sodium hyperchlorite is considered to be a specific method
   and allows a continuous quantification.  UV-Photometry leads only in
   ultra-clean water to an unspecific detection of all examined sanitation
   products up to a concentration in ppm range.
   The direct on line inspection of working surfaces is possible with the
   Screening Electron Microscopy under Low Vacuum with Energy Dispersif
   X-ray spectroscopy-analysis (SEM-LV/EDX), but this method allows only
   the characterisation of the inspected surface and the detection of
   inorganic contaminations apported by the detergent.  The FT-IR-ATR
   (Fourier Transform - Infrared - Attenuated Total internal Reflection)
   method allows to characterise the residues of sanitation products and
   proteins on polyurethane surfaces.  The OSEE (Optically Stimulated
   Electron Emission) method allows to detect mug quantites of detergent,
   disenfectant and organic residues per cm2 stainless steel and
   polyrethane surface.
   It can be concluded that the UV-Photometry is unsuitable for the
   determination of sanitation products under the conditions of meat
   industry.  For the on line inspection of working surfaces the
   OSEE-method allows the determination of small quantities and with the
   FT-IR-ATR-method is possible to characterise the detected residue.}},

   significant differences between male and female cells, in either the
   baseline SCE frequency or that induced by mitomycin C at concentrations
   of 0.01 and 0.03 mu g/ml. No significant differences were observed in
   the distribution of high SCE frequency cells (HFC), even if it is
   possible to observe a higher level of exchanges in XX cells in each

   towards slightly higher SCE rates in females, even if results are not

   considered to illustrate homomorphic signal processing, In particular,
   an analytic expression is derived for the frequency domain
   representation of a signal that has been recovered from a multi-path

   time-delayed, scaled versions of the transmitted signal, and the
   transmitted signal is to be recovered, The recovered signal is expressed
   analytically in the frequency domain, By truncating an infinite series,
   the recovered signal can be expressed in the time domain, The analytic
   expressions can be used to predict the distortion that will result in
   the recovered signal when the cepstral processing is implemented with
   Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs), The analytic expression of a
   recovered signal is compared with the signal recovered with DFTs, The
   signal recovery from a multi-path signal that is composed of the

Abstract = {{Mortality rates associated with peritoneal dialysis (PD) have been found
   to be higher than those associated with hemodialysis (HD) among
   prevalent U.S. patients over the age of 55 in the preceding study. Given
   the substantial technical differences between PD and HD, causes of death
   might also be expected to differ between these dialytic modalities. In
   order to help elucidate the relative contributions of these technical
   differences and to further the understanding of the excess mortality
   observed among PD-treated dialysis patients, this epidemiologic study
   compared cause of death in prevalent HD- and PD-treated patients in a
   large national sample, adjusting for demographic characteristics, Data
   for patients prevalent on January 1 of the years 1987, 1988, and 1989,
   each with 1 yr of follow-up, were obtained from the U.S. Renal Data
   System. Patients were censored at transplantation. Death rates per 100
   patient years for seven cause-of-death categories were compared between
   HD and PD, adjusting for age, race, gender, cause of ESRD (diabetes
   versus nondiabetes), and < 1 yr or > 1 yr of prior ESRD, by use of the
   Poisson regression. There were 42,372 deaths occurring over 170,700
   patient years at risk. There was a significantly increased mortality
   risk for PD compared with HD for all cause-of-death categories, except
   malignancy, for which there was a higher mortality risk for HD. The
   excess all-cause mortality observed in PD-treated patients can be
   accounted for, in decreasing order, by infection (35\%), acute
   myocardial infarction (24\%), other cardiac causes (16\%),
   cerebrovascular disease (8\%), withdrawal (8\%), and malignancy (-6\%).
   The increased risk of death due to `'other cardiac causes'' and
   withdrawal from dialysis in PD-treated patients was found only among
   diabetics, and the increased risk due to acute myocardial infarction was
   accentuated among diabetics. The increased risk of death due to
   infection was accentuated in female patients. The PD/HD risk ratio of
   death increased with age for the category `'other cardiac causes'' and
   cerebrovascular disease, whereas it decreased with age for deaths due to
   withdrawal from dialysis.}},

Abstract = {{TATA-less genes are often GC-rich in the region of transcriptional

   by mapping the transcription start site of the rat insulin-Bike growth
   factor 1 (IGFBP-1) gene to the correct position (nucleotides -173
   relative to ATG, +1). Using total RNA obtained from the rat liver cell
   line BRL-3A, the transcription start sites of the rat IGFBP-2 gene were
   mapped to a narrow cluster extending from nucleotides -86 to -90 (ATG,
   +1), 39 bp downstream of three adjacent GC boxes that are essential to
   the transcriptional activity of the gene, The assay was also used to map
   the start sites of a luciferase reporter gene driven by the fragment
   -1,295 to -32 of the rat IGFBP-2 promoter after transfection in the
   human embryonic kidney cell line 293, The hybrid gene utilized the same
   transcription start sites as the rat IGFBP-2 gene, indicating that the
   elements required for positioning of the transcription initiation
   complex are contained within the 3' end terminating at nucleotide -32,
   These studies demonstrate the usefulness of the TAP-RLPCR assay for
   verifying the authenticity of ambiguous start sites, and definitively
   map the start sites of the rat IGFBP-2 gene.}},

Abstract = {{A comparison was made between two personal auxiliary cooling approaches
   for the relief of thermal stress while wearing the standard USAF
   Chemical Defense Ensemble (CDE). Subjects exercised at approximately
   40\% VO(2)max in either warm (28/24/34 degrees C) or hot (38/26/43
   degrees C) environmental conditions, (Tdb/Twb/Tbg degrees C,
   respectively). During each of three trials, four hours of intermittent
   work (four work/rest cycles) were attempted. Microclimate air cooling
   was applied in two different fashions and compared with a control trial
   during which no cooling was received (NC). In one trial, conditioned air
   cooling (Tin approximately 20 degrees Cdb) was delivered during rest
   periods only (intermittent cooling, IC), while during the second trial,
   ambient air cooling was also applied during the work period in addition
   to the conditioned air delivered during rest periods (continuous
   cooling, CC). During the warm condition, exposure cycle time was 45 min
   work and 15 min rest, while under the hot conditions, exposure cycle
   time was 30 min work and 30 min rest. Both CC and IC trials resulted in
   significantly extended work times, lower final rectal temperatures,
   heart rates, and sweat production (SP) than in the NC trial.
   Additionally, CC resulted in significantly lower SP, higher \% sweat
   evaporation, and lower ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and thermal
   comfort (TC) than IC at both warm and hot temperatures. Moreover,
   subjects were better able to maintain thermal equilibrium (i.e.,
   cumulative heat balance) over time using CC compared to IC in the warm
   environment. The physiological significance of these findings, in some
   cases, was secondary to the improvement in subjective measures of TC and
   RPE. In conclusion, the addition of ambient air, microclimate cooling
   during work in these environments is effective in lowering thermal
   strain for subjects exercising in the heat while wearing the CDE.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the buoyancy-driven motion and deformation of viscous drops

   interfacial tension effects are important while inertial effects are

   systems, and the drop shapes are quantitatively characterized using
   digital image analysis. The retarding effect of the capillary wall is
   found to decrease as the buoyancy force becomes more dominant compared
   to surface tension, or as the drop fluid becomes less viscous relative
   to the suspending fluid. However, for a given viscosity ratio, there is
   a limiting value of the Bond number beyond which the wall effect remains
   unchanged with further increases in the Bond number. The thickness of
   the liquid film surrounding large drops is found to be rather
   insensitive to the value of the viscosity ratio. Theoretical predictions
   based on the numerical solution of the creeping flow equations using the
   boundary integral method are shown to be in good agreement with the

Abstract = {{Background. The posterior pituitary hormones appear to be involved in
   the etiology of primary dysmenorrhoea, but mechanisms regulating their
   release, particularly the influence of ovarian steroids, are not fully
   understood.
   Methods. The effect of 17 beta-estradiol and medroxyprogesterone alone
   and in combination on oxytocin and vasopressin levels was therefore
   studied in 10 postmenopausal women.
   Results. Transdermal treatment with estradiol alone by means of patches
   in a dose of 100 mu g/24 h for five days resulted in an elevation of the
   mean plasma concentration of this hormone from undetectable to 262
   pmol/l and increase in mean circulating levels of vasopressin from 0.82
   to 1.22 pmol/l and of oxytocin from 2.50 to 3.98 pmol/l. Oral
   administration of medroxyprogesterone in a dose of 10 mg per day for 5
   days, which resulted in a mean plasma level of 4.3 nmol/l, suppressed
   vasopressin concentrations to 0.60 pmol/l. When given after five days of
   treatment with estradiol, medroxyprogesterone also antagonized the
   stimulatory effect of the estrogen on vasopressin secretion.
   Medroxyprogesterone alone increased the plasma oxytocin concentration to
   3.26 pmol/l, but the progestogen did not significantly influence the
   stimulatory effect of estradiol on oxytocin secretion.
   Conclusions. It is concluded that posterior pituitary hormone secretion
   is influenced by estradiol and progestogens, and that this may be a
   mechanism for the involvement of ovarian hormones in the etiology of
   primary dysmenorrhoea.}},

   profile characteristics and micromorphological features are described
   for the full stratigraphic succession, preserved at the St Paul's donga

   interpretation of pedogenic processes active on hillslopes during the
   polycyclic accretion of colluvial sediments blanketing many hillslopes

   with periodic Fe mobilization and reprecipitation,was active at
   differing intensities in all of the palaeosols studied. The
   palaeoclimatic implications of the aforementioned processes during the

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to investigate whether acute alterations of
   amniotic fluid volume affect uteroplacental perfusion.
   STUDY DESIGN: Three groups of patients of comparable gestational age
   were studied in a fetal medicine referral unit: (1) eight pregnancies
   with severe polyhydramnios because of twin-twin transfusion syndrome
   undergoing therapeutic amnioreduction, (2) seven with severe
   oligohydramnios undergoing diagnostic amnioinfusion, and (3) six control
   women having invasive procedures of similar duration without
   manipulation of amniotic fluid volume. Color Doppler imaging was used to
   measure uterine artery impedance index values and quantitative blood
   flow before and within 15 minutes of the end of the procedure.
   RESULTS: Quantitative flow measurements increased after amnioreduction
   (74\% median increase of volume flow, range 22\% to 329\%, p < 0.01) and
   decreased after amnioinfusion (33\% median decrease of volume flow range
   17\% to 51\%, p < 0.05). Impedance index values increased after
   amnioinfusion (25\% median increase in pulsatility index, range 4\% to
   71\%, p < 0.05) and did not alter with amnioreduction. There were no
   significant changes in the control group.
   CONCLUSION: Acute changes in amniotic fluid volume alter uteroplacental
   perfusion. In twin-twin transfusion syndrome amelioration in uterine
   flow may improve fetal condition and explain in part the success of
   serial amnioreduction therapy.}},

Abstract = {{A 3-year-old male grey collie and 4-year-old female grey collie were
   part of a cyclic hematopoiesis study. Both dogs had experienced numerous
   bacterial infections, and both dogs were receiving various treatment
   regimens, including lithium and hematopoietic growth factors, to control
   the cyclic hematopoiesis, The first dog was presented in acute;collapse
   and had a rapid clinical course. The second dog was presented with
   pyrexia and subsequently developed anorexia, disorientation, tremors,
   mild diarrhea, and bruising at venipuncture sites. Postmortem
   examination revealed pancreatic adenocarcinoma with metastasis in both
   cases. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a rare neoplasm in dogs. The
   incidence of pancreatic adenocarcinoma noted in this report is more than
   150 times that previously reported in dogs. The cause of the increased
   incidence of pancreatic malignancy in these grey collies is unknown;
   possible factors include chronic inflammation or infections, chronic
   drug therapy, or genetic predisposition. Development of an uncommon
   neoplasm in two young grey collies may offer an opportunity to study the

Abstract = {{In this paper a descriptive account is given of programme budgeting in
   the Hastings and Pother localities of East Sussex Health Authority. The
   primary purpose of the exercise was to track past resource consumption
   in a comprehensive and overlapping matrix of programmes,;with a view to
   simplifying past annual expenditure into a single matrix, informing the
   health authority of the overall pattern of resource consumption,
   planning future expenditure, co-ordinating the strategic plans and
   purchasing intentions of all those involved in commissioning health
   care, and communicating the health authority's view of past and future
   spending. Many of the findings gave new insights and led either to
   changes in resource allocation or to plans for future study. They have
   proved to be a useful tool for communication and education, especially
   with providers of health care and public representative bodies. The
   process will now feed into long-term strategic planning and short-term
   purchasing intentions. Marginal analysis is now being undertaken in a
   number of clinical specialties and disease areas. The cumulative effect
   of a series of planned investment and disinvestment decisions can be
   tested against agreed priorities for programmes before final decisions
   are taken. Thus, programme budgeting can be a powerful tool in the
   commissioning process and should be within the capabilities of even the
   smallest health authorities.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to test if long-term mortality could be
   predicted by endothelial derived haemostatic variables in a population
   with high morbidity due to thromboembolic disease, Plasma samples were
   drawn from 212 out-patients treated with oral anticoagulants. at the
   beginning of the study, and analyzed for mass concentration of tissue
   plasminogen activator (tPA) and its inhibitor (PAI-1), and von
   Willebrand factor. In the course of 3.8-year follow-up 45 patients died,
   including 38 vascular deaths. We found that all-cause mortality was
   significantly associated with increased levels of VWF and tPa. For
   vascular mortality there was a significant association with all three
   haemostatic variables (tPA, PAI-1, vWF). For VWF there was a 3-fold
   increase in total and vascular mortality in the highest quartile
   compared to the lowest quartile. There were 27 vascular deaths in the
   group of patients with a tPA-value above the median compared to 11 in
   those with a tPA below the median. In multivariate Cox regression
   analysis (including: age, sex, smoking habits, body mass index, diabetes
   mellitus, hypertension, tPA, PAI-1, and vWF), vWF and smoking were
   independently significantly associated with all-cause mortality, and tPA
   and age with vascular mortality. Endothelial derived haemostatic
   variables are predictors of total and vascular mortality in patients
   treated with oral anticoagulants.}},

Abstract = {{Sediment samples and marine organisms were collected in the Saguenay
   Fjord and at two selected sites in the St Lawrence Estuary in 1991.
   Total PCDDs and total PCDFs ranged from 22 to 352 acid 29 to 188 ng
   kg(-1), respectively in Saguenay sediments, while total PCDFs reached
   287 ng kg(-1) in Bale des Anglais, a small and deep bay of the St
   Lawrence Estuary impacted by PCBs during the 1970s. All biological
   samples contained detectable amounts of chlorinated dibenzodioxins and
   dibenzofurans, apart from the North Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). The
   highest concentrations (up to 59.7 ng kg(-1) total PCDFs and 2.54 ng
   kg(-1) 2,3,7,8- T4CDD Equivalent (TCDD TEQ)) were observed in crab
   (Chionoecetes opilio) caught in Saguenay, and in crab and whelk
   (Buccinum undatum) collected in Bale des Anglais. Nordic shrimp
   (Pandalus borealis) seems less contaminated with a maximum total PCDDs
   and PCDFs concentration of 14.0 ng kg(-1) and TCDD TEQ never exceeding
   0.7 ng kg(-1). Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) caught
   in the Saguenay Fjord contained only 2,3,7,8 substituted congeners in
   their tissues leading to a very low average TCDD TEQ of 1.66 ng kg(-1).
   Based upon this first series of results, benthic organisms and fish from
   the Saguenay Fjord and the north shore of the St Lawrence Estuary are
   exposed to low levels of PCDDs and PCDFs, and carry tissue
   concentrations well below international guidelines for fisheries

Abstract = {{Early diagnosis of leptospirosis is important because severe leptospiral
   infection can run a fulminant course. The polymerase chain reaction
   (PCR) was evaluated for the detection of leptospires in clinical samples
   from patients with acute leptospiral infection. Blood and urine samples
   from 71 patients with leptospirosis were examined by PCR, culture or
   serology. Samples from 44 (62 \%) patients with the diagnosis of
   leptospirosis were positive by PCR as compared to 34 (48 \%) by culture.
   The presence of leptospires was demonstrated by PCR in 13 patients
   before the development of antibodies, as well as in two patients who
   were seronegative during their illness and at autopsy. Samples from 16
   patients without leptospirosis were seronegative and culture negative,
   and also negative by PCR. We conclude that PCR is a rapid, sensitive and
   specific during the first few days of the disease.}},

Abstract = {{Studied was the diet of crested porcupines by faecal analysis in a rural
   hilly area in central Italy. Food categories were identified by
   comparison with either isolated sections of fresh plant material or
   digested fragments obtained from captive porcupines fed experimentally
   Roots predominated in the diet and were consumed at a similar frequency
   all year round. Herbs were the most eaten epygeal category especially in
   winter and spring. Possibly the winter consumption of herbs was related
   to a decrease in the availability of other food categories, such as
   grass inflorescences and Fruits. Consumption of these two food
   categories was positively correlated and inversely associated with
   herbs, Grass inflorescences (mainly Hordeum murinum) were an important
   diet component in summer, Porcupines fed on fruits mainly in summer and
   autumn. The consumption of storage organs increased in winter and in
   spring. The values of trophic niche breadth and overlap suggested that
   porcupines are generalist foragers. These feeding habits. combined with
   the abandonment by man of the countryside in the last few decades, may
   partly explain the recent range expansion of the crested porcupine in
   Italy.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, Frank F. Schambach has extended his argument that the Spiro

   this site also represents an intrusion of Mississippian peoples onto the
   Red River to control the flow of trade items between the Southern Plains
   and the Eastern Woodlands. A major deficiency in this argument is that
   much of the archaeological record of northeastern Texas and southeastern
   Oklahoma-which provides contradictory evidence for his model-is not
   utilized. The data from the Red River Valley demonstrate that the
   Sanders site is part of a larger complex of sites, locally termed the
   Sanders phase, and that these sites represent occupation by a Red River
   Valley Caddoan population that interacted with groups in the Arkansas

Abstract = {{An assessment of the short- and long-term hazards from municipal solid
   waste incinerator (MSWI) ash is made through the elemental analysis of
   40 to 50 elements in the ash and leachates produced by several leaching
   procedures. The ash was analyzed using neutron activation analysis (NAA)
   and x-ray fluorescence (XRF). The leachates were analyzed using NAA and
   inductively-coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (lCP). The
   leaching dynamics of an ash monofill were modelled with a series of
   extractions using simulated acid rain. An initial spike of the metals
   Ag, Ba, Be, Cr, Cu, Mo, Pb, Sr, and Zn in the leachates appears to be
   the greatest hazard posed by MSWI ash monofills. The elements As, Cd,
   Cu, Hg, Pb, S, and Zn were identified as potential long term hazards
   utilizing a sequential extraction procedure which approximates the total
   amount of the elements available over the lifetime of the monofill.
   The pH of the resulting leachate is the single greatest factor governing
   the concentration of metals in solution, more important than the
   concentration of the element in the ash. These results are applied to an
   assessment of the suitability of the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching
   Procedure (TCLP) in measuring leaching potential of an MSWI ash
   monofill.}},

Abstract = {{Exposure of naive PC12 cells, sympathetic neurons from rat superior
   cervical ganglia, and brain-derived septal neurons to epidermal and
   nerve growth factors simultaneously resulted in some alteration of
   cellular events induced by nerve growth factor alone. A more pronounced
   decline of catecholamine content, no additional change in
   acetylcholinesterase activity, and additive stimulation of RNA and
   protein syntheses were found in PC12 cells. Earlier elevation of the
   enzyme activity was observed in sympathetic but not in septal neurons.
   Epidermal growth factor appeared to support independently the same level
   of acetylcholinesterase activity in septal neurons as revealed for nerve
   growth factor during the first week and cell survival throughout 2 weeks
   of observation. The data obtained indicate that epidermal growth factor
   augments temporarily some effects of nerve growth factor, thus
   supporting the idea of an important role of mitogenic growth factors in
   neural development as complementary and/or substitutive regulators of
   nerve cell differentiation and survival.}},

   across the joint, from 60 MN m(-2) for V-p = 0.25 to 35 MN m(-2) for V-p
   = 0.40. The use of an interlayer of 2124 alloy increased the nl ea of
   metal to metal contact to give improved bond strength. Microstructural
   characterisation of the bonds showed that the magnesium present in the
   2124 alloy was a crucial factor in forming a joint, since it disrupted
   the surface oxide to allow metal interdiffusion. (C) 1995 HMSO.}},

Abstract = {{Tunneled intraspinal catheters and catheter-pump systems are
   increasingly common treatments for severe chronic pain, but these
   long-term catheters have caused meningitis, epidural abscesses, and
   other serious infections. At a cancer referral center, 81 catheters were
   placed in 72 patients over a 7-year period. There were seven
   catheter-associated infections: two were meningeal (one was accompanied
   by an epidural abscess and one by a pocket infection and bacteremia),
   four were associated with a pocket, and one was associated with a
   tunnel. The infection rate was 0.77 per 1,000 catheter-days. Pathogenic
   organisms that were isolated were primarily normal skin Bora. By
   multivariate Cox analysis, the only factor significantly associated with
   catheter infection was prolonged catheter placement surgery, i.e., a
   procedure lasting at least 100 minutes (RR, 8.8; 95\% CI, 1.6-50). Three
   patients were cured by removal of the catheter and treatment with
   antibiotics, and symptoms were satisfactorily suppressed in four
   patients with antibiotics alone. Considering the severity of illness in
   catheter recipients, the infection rate was relatively low. Removal of
   the catheter does not appear mandatory when the goal is suppression of
   infection-related symptoms, especially when the infection has not spread
   to the CMS, the infecting organism has an intrinsically low virulence,
   and the infected patient is terminally ill.}},

   of the posterior midgut primordium are greatly deformed, but their

Abstract = {{beta(2)-Agonist drugs may be illegally used as growth promoters for
   feedlot calves, when mixed into milk replacer immediately before
   feeding. To check for the presence of clenbuterol, salbutamol and
   terbutaline in such food, an analytical system was established using a
   screening method based on two commercial qualitative competitive ELISA
   tests, with antibodies raised against the arylamino group and the
   t-butyl group. The extraction procedure was based on precipitation of
   the milk samples with acetonitrile followed by filtration. The absence
   of any significant interference by other substances in the filtrate
   allowed detection of beta(2)-agonist drugs in spiked samples at the
   lowest concentration having a repartitioning effect (50 ppb for
   clenbuterol, mabuterol and terbutaline, 500 ppb for salbutamol). In view
   of a false positive response with tetracycline in milk samples and a
   cross-reaction between clenbuterol and mabuterol, an HPLC-MS technique
   was developed which, after extraction and purification of the samples
   with SPE C18 Polar Plus, was able to confirm the presence of these
   drugs. The good recovery after extraction (ranging from 84\% to 90.2\%)
   and the low detection limit with this method (250 ng/ml for clenbuterol,
   mabuterol and terbutaline, and 2.5 mu g/ml for salbutamol) allowed easy
   confirmation and simultaneous detection of the four beta(2)-agonists at

Abstract = {{Antagonists of the type 1 (AT(1)) angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor
   increase renin secretion and plasma Ang II levels, and the increased Ang
   II levels may counteract the effects of the antagonist. Moreover, other
   investigators have suggested that the reactive increase in Ang II levels
   may increase bradykinin (BK) levels through stimulation of the type 2
   Ang II receptor (AT(2)). We investigated the acute effects of the AT(1)
   receptor antagonist losartan (intraarterial injection of 10 mg/kg every
   12 h) in male Sprague Dawley rats by measuring circulating angiotensin
   and BK peptides at 6, 12, and 24 h. Whereas acute losartan
   administration increased blood angiotensin levels four- to sixfold,
   blood BK levels were unchanged. We also investigated the effects of
   losartan administered for 8 days (10 mg/kg every 12 hours, by
   intraperitoneal injection) on circulating and tissue levels of
   angiotensin and BK peptides, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE).
   Losartan increased plasma renin levels 100-fold; plasma angiotensinogen
   levels decreased to 24\% of control; and plasma aldosterone levels were
   unchanged. Ang II levels in plasma, adrenal, lung, heart, and aorta were
   increased 25-, 8-, 3.5-, 2.4-, and 14-fold, respectively, by losartan
   administration. By contrast, kidney Ang II levels decreased to 71\% of
   control, accompanied by a decrease in kidney levels of BK-(1-7) and
   BK-(1-9). No other tissue showed a change in BK peptide levels, except
   for a reduction in blood levels of BK-(1-8) to 43\% of control, Plasma
   ACE increased by 13-50\%, but tissue ACE levels were unchanged. These
   data demonstrate that losartan has tissue-specific effects on endogenous
   levels of angiotensin and BK peptides and indicate that increased BK
   levels do not contribute to the actions of losartan. The absence of a
   reactive increase in endogenous kidney levels of Ang II indicates that
   this tissue is likely to be the most sensitive to AT(1) receptor
   antagonism.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. This study used a meta-analysis to examine HLA-DR
   frequencies in rheumatic heart disease and prospectively examined other
   class II allelic disease associations.
   Background. Studies of rheumatic heart disease have reported HLA class
   II allelic associations, but these are inconsistent.
   Methods. A meta-analysis combined all known (n = 10) studies to
   determine disease risk associated with HLA-DR antigen expression.
   Meta-analysis of studies grouped by ethnic derivation of subjects was
   also performed. The present study also examined DQA, DQB and DPB allele
   frequencies by DNA-based strategies.
   Results. Meta-analysis showed a significant negative disease association
   with DR5 (odds ratio {[}OR] 0.67, p < 0.00003) for all combined studies.
   Among black patients, DR1 was increased (OR 2.80 p < 0.004); DR6 was
   increased (OR, 2.03, p < 0.003); and DR 8 was decreased (OR 0.32, p <
   0.02). Among Eastern Indian patients, DR3 was increased (OR 2.44, p <
   0.00003), with decreased expression for DR2 (OR 0.31, p < 0.00001) and
   DR5 (OR 0.52, p < 0.05). DR4 was increased among American whites (OR
   1.74, p < 0.03), although there was significant heterogeneity among
   studies of whites. DQA, DQB and DPB allele frequencies were similar for
   control subjects and patients.
   Conclusions. Our findings support an association between major
   histocompatibility complex class II alleles and risk for rheumatic heart
   disease. However, heterogeneity in associations was observed among
   different ethnic and racial groups; regional and temporal differences in
   streptococcal outbreaks may compound this heterogeneity. Further studies
   are necessary to elucidate the respective contributions of these
   variables.}},

Abstract = {{A neural network is proposed for the recognition of partially overlapped
   particle images in the analysis of Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV)
   frames. The Kohonen neural network is an approximation to an optimum
   classifier. In this work it allows single particle images to be
   distinguished from overlapped particle images by shape analysis: it
   classifies 99.1\% of the spots correctly (in test images). If a spot has
   an almost circular shape, the barycenter co-ordinates are extracted. If
   the spot shape is far from being circular, it is believed to be a
   particle overlap, and a procedure to find more centroids is activated.
   The particle recognizer based on the Kohonen neural network is tested on
   both multi-exposed and single-exposure images at high particle density,
   and compared to a particle recognizer that did not consider the partial
   overlap. The management of overlapped particles causes the neural
   network to produce a big improvement in the number of barycenters that
   can be extracted from these images. The practical consequence is that
   the seeding density in PTV can be increased, so as to improve the
   spatial resolution of the technique in the velocity field calculation.}},

Abstract = {{1. Chylomicron remnants, the intermediate intestinal lipoproteins
   carrying the bulk of dietary cholesterol, are actively taken up and
   degraded in the hepatocytes, releasing cholesterol which can be excreted
   in bile. To study this pathway, a mass of remnants, leading to a
   consistent rise in hepatic cholesterol, was administered as an
   intravenous bolus in rats with chronic bile fistula equilibrated by
   water, electrolyte and taurocholate infusions, and changes in biliary
   lipids and bile acids were evaluated for up to 24 h in comparison with
   baseline.
   2. A mean 16\% increase in the net output of bile acids was observed at
   each time interval after lipoprotein injection, accounting for a 24 h
   cumulative excretion of approximately one-third of the administered
   cholesterol mass. These changes did not reach statistical significance
   however. The cholesterol output and concentrations of all biliary lipids
   did not vary either. Without taurocholate replacement, remnants
   injection was followed by a 15-20\% decrease in bile acid and bile lipid
   secretion, presumably due to an insufficient hepatic bile-acid flux.
   3. When {[}H-3] cholesterol-labelled remnants were administered at the
   same mass in the chronic equilibrated bile fistula model, 21\% of
   injected radioactivity was excreted in 24 h, distributing mostly in
   acidic rather than neutral sterols (20.02 +/- 1.85 compared with 1.07
   +/- 0.04), with an acidic to neutral sterol mean ratio of 16.
   4. To exclude interfering effects from the administered cholesterol mass
   and chronic bile fistula, H-3-labelled remnants were also studied as a
   cholesterol trace injected in rats with acute bile fistula. In this
   case, however, 24 h total sterol radioactivity only reached
   approximately 10\% of that injected, and partitioned relatively less in
   acidic (6.84 +/- 0.59) than in neutral (3.15 +/- 0.39) sterols, with an
   acidic to neutral sterol mean ratio of 2.
   5. The study suggests that remnant cholesterol reaches bile mainly in
   the form of bile acids, by a steady slow-rate process which is magnified
   under conditions of stimulated bile-acid synthesis.}},

   social and interpersonal process, not an inevitable consequence of
   primary symptoms and neurochemical abnormality'' (Estroff 1989), It is
   the intent of this paper to elaborate on this theme by exploring how the
   neuropsychological deficits of schizophrenia relate to the observed
   social handicaps of people who carry the diagnosis. We argue that a
   better understanding of schizophrenia requires inquiry into the
   handicaps as well as the process whereby schizophrenic and
   preschizophrenic men and women try and fail to negotiate socially
   mandated roles, Of necessity, such an inquiry will require mixing levels
   of explanation (Meehl 1990) and will draw upon insights from the
   disciplines of psychiatry, neuropsychology, and sociology.}},

Abstract = {{p330(d)/CENP-F is a novel proliferation-associated and cell
   cycle-dependent centromere autoantigen which appears to play a very
   important role in mitotic progression. As an initial step in exploring
   the clinical and biological significance of autoantibodies to this
   protein, we evaluated the clinical histories of 26 patients producing
   these antibodies. The antibodies were detected by both indirect
   immunofluorescence microscopy (IIF) and Western blotting. All the sera
   contained anti-p330(d)/CENP-F IgG antibodies, with an average titer by
   IIF of 1:6,917 (range 1:160 to 1:20,380). Most of the patients had
   disorders associated with abnormal or increased cell proliferation at
   the time the anti-p330(d)/CENP-F antibodies were detected. These
   included cancers of various types (14), chronic liver disease (3),
   chronic rejection of renal allografts (2), and Crohn's disease (1). The
   average IIF titer of the anti-p330(d)/CENP-F antibodies in the patients
   with cancer, 1:10,103, was significantly higher than the average titer
   in non-cancer patients, 1:3,200 (P=0.008). Autoimmunity to
   p330(d)/CENP-F appeared not to be associated with rheumatic diseases, in
   particular scleroderma, since only three of the 26 patients had
   rheumatic disease and the antibodies were not detected by IIF in a group
   of 351 patients with scleroderma and related disorders. Our findings,
   although retrospective and limited to a relatively small number of
   patients, point to the hypothesis that autoimmunity to p330(d)/CENP-F
   could be related to events involving increased or abnormal cell
   proliferation. (C) 1995 Academic Press Limited}},

Abstract = {{Patenting as well as uses of patent documents as important technology
   information tools are well known for strategic planning in global R\&D
   and their commercialisation. The latest electronics and information
   technologies like CD-ROMs, On-line databases and Internet have made sea
   changes in organisations handling patent information, their storage,
   search, retrieval etc. These have facilitated rapid query-based search
   and retrieval of vast technical information and their timely
   availability; thus further multiplying their utilisation.
   This article presents an impact analysis of CD-ROMs, Online databases
   and Internet on Patents Information as a whole. Sources of Patent
   information - commercial online, CD-ROM based and public domain patent
   databases from Internet, their contents and their synergistic role are
   also covered, Two case studies are presented to demonstrate the role
   patent information analysis plays in determining: i) strategies for
   national technology planning as well as ii) inputs for corporate
   planning of a large company.
   It is followed by an analysis of patent information for technology
   monitoring, technology and market forecast, pointers to competitor's
   strength etc, in electronics sector by carrying-out CD-ROM search of
   patents in 1994. The effectiveness of this methodology for these
   purposes is amply demonstrated.
   Responding to the needs, subject-specific CD-ROMs of patents have also
   started appearing in the market. While retrospective storage, search and
   retrieval of full, patent documents may continue to be done by national
   agencies dealing with patent information services, it Is now feasible to
   set-up subject-specific Technology Alert Patent Search System (TAPS) to
   provide inputs for strategic planning based on the analysis of current
   patents filed globally.}},

   CLINICOPATHOLOGICAL STUDY OF 11 CASES}},
Journal = {{CANCER}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{76}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Background. Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LELC), best known to occur
   in the nasopharynx, can arise in a variety of sites, such as the
   salivary gland, thymus, lung, stomach, and skin. Primary LELC of the
   lung is very rare, with only limited information in the literature.
   Methods. The clinicopathologic features of 11 patients with pulmonary
   LELC collected from two regional hospitals in Hong Kong are described.
   Results. The patients, all Chinese, were aged 38 to 73 years (median, 54
   years), with equal sex incidence. Two of the 8 patients were smokers.
   Four presented with coin lesions incidentally discovered on chest X-ray,
   five with cough and blood-stained sputum, and two with pleural effusion.
   The tumor formed a discrete (9 patients) or an ill-defined (1 patient)
   nodule in the lung, or, rarely, showed extensive bilateral pulmonary
   involvement (1 patient). The major bronchi were not involved except in 1
   patient. Three patients had lymph node metastasis at presentation; two
   of them had bone metastasis, one at presentation and one after 9 months.
   The tumors had pushing margins, and grew in the form of anastomosing
   islands and sheets, comprising syncytial-appearing large cells with
   vesicular nuclei and prominent nucleoli. They were infiltrated by an
   appreciable number of small lymphocytes and plasma cells. Intratumoral
   amyloid globules were found in one tumor. In five patients, the tumor
   showed intraepithelial growth within the small bronchi; this could
   represent either the in-situ phase of the tumor or pagetoid spread into
   the bronchial epithelium. The neoplastic cells of all patients harbored
   Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) as demonstrated by in situ hybridization for
   EBV-encoded small nuclear RNAs. All eight Asian patients with pulmonary
   LELC previously reported in the literature similarly have been
   EBV-positive, whereas the four reported Caucasian patients all have been
   EBV-negative.
   Conclusion. Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma of lung occurring in Asians
   is an EBV-associated neoplasm; it also appears to occur at a higher
   frequency in Asians than Caucasians. It usually presents as a solitary
   subpleural nodule, and there is no strong association with cigarette
   smoking. Most patients have early stage disease at presentation. From
   the limited available data, the behavior of LELC of lung is highly
   variable, ranging from apparent curability by excision (particularly for
   localized disease) to highly aggressive, extensive disease at
   presentation.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we look at mean field annealing (MFA) as a deterministic
   approximation to the stochastic relaxation (SR) algorithm in the context
   of stereo matching. MFA is examined from two different perspectives:
   information theory and statistical mechanics. The mean field solution,
   which minimizes the relative entropy of an approximated distribution
   with respect to the posterior distribution, is shown to be equivalent to
   the optimal Bayes estimate in maximum a posteriori (MAP) sense. Two
   illustrative examples of approximated distribution are discussed. On the
   other hand, from the viewpoint of statistical mechanics, we examine a
   deterministic version of simulated annealing (SA) algorithm with Gibbs
   sampler based on the similarity between the induced field and the
   marginal energy function. An iterative, deterministic algorithm is
   developed to obtain the mean field solution, A number of image examples
   are used to verify the proposed algorithms and to highlight how close
   the MFA approximates SR.}},

   composite flow fields as single units without storage, produced
   significant differences between simulated and observed stage and

   results in the case of the laboratory data, but was less successful when
   applied to the field data. The diagonal interface method, which in this

Abstract = {{A method for the design of second-order sliding mode controllers is
   developed for a class of nonlinear systems. The key idea is the
   necessity of nullifying both the auxiliary output as well as its time
   derivative when the system is sliding. It is found that if the auxiliary
   output has a strong vector relative degree one, it is possible to design
   a continuous control input. This allows the application of the sliding
   mode control to systems that do not allow discontinuous control signals
   generated by the classical variable structure control. Robustness of the
   controllers is analyzed and dynamic bounds for the uncertainty are found
   for a class of nonlinear systems. The design technique could be extended
   to nth-order sliding controllers, though the complexity of the
   calculations increases and the robustness bounds become more
   restrictive. The application of the technique to a drum-type steam
   generating unit to solve a robust tracking problem is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Horizontal and vertical strings were presented in a `'crosswords''
   format within left or right visual fields.  Distractor strings were
   varied to examine the extent to which prelexical,

   not focally attended.  The results supported 2 predictions of the
   pathway strength model of attentional modulation (J.D. Cohen, K. Dunbar,
   \& J.L. McClelland, 1990).  First, distractor influences were greater
   when participants attended to the weaker (i.e., vertical) item and
   ignored the stronger (i.e., horizontal) string, than vice versa. 
   Second, distractors similar to the target facilitated, whereas
   dissimilar distractors interfered with, pronunciation responses.  It is
   concluded that spatial attention can modulate word recognition
   processes, and that some interesting questions emerge when one abandons
   the assumptions of serial, noninteractive word recognition processes.}},

Abstract = {{During the BOF process for the production of crude steel, the specific

   particles is influenced by blowing parameters; physical properties of
   process gas and of dust phases; and, type and layout of the converter
   and the filter system. In this work, a numerical simulation model is
   developed that simulates the pneumatic conveyance and sedimentation of
   primarily coarse dust particles in the BOF gas cleaning system.
   Comparison is then made of predicted coarse dust characteristics with
   values for dust sampled from an existing plant in order to verify the
   plausibility of the developed model.}},

Abstract = {{In his Theory of Communicative Action, Habermas (1984, 1987) argues that
   because Goffman's dramaturgy emphasizes the goal-oriented or strategic
   nature of actors' self-presentations, it fails to establish the
   conditions for noncoerced or reasoned communication After reviewing
   Habermas's negative reading of Goffman, 1 assess both Habermas's and
   Goffman's theories in the context of professional practice and
   organizational behavior I suggest that certain programs in the social
   psychology of organizations, such as Argyris and Schon's (1974) action
   research, share Habermas's one-sided view of Goffman's actor as an
   opportunistic, insincere manipulator. This misreading of Goffman results
   from a fundamental confusion over the ontology and epistemology of
   `'impression management.'' I conclude that if Habermas's theory of
   communicative action is to advance further that is, if it is ever to
   adequately link with the empirical social world it must come to move
   concrete terms with the nature of the presented self}},

   EXCISION}},

Abstract = {{Background and Objective. Nevus sebaceus is a hamartoma of the skin with
   the potential to develop benign and malignant neoplasms. Prophylactic
   surgical excision has been advocated, usually before puberty, to prevent
   their occurrence; however, it is the clinical impression of the authors
   that the development of cutaneous neoplasms is infrequent and, if they
   develop, they are usually benign and nonaggressive. Our objective was to
   investigate the clinical outcome and histopathologic findings of every
   single nevus sebaceus that had been excised in our institution in a
   five-year period.
   Methods. Two hundred and twenty-five consecutive cases, coded as nevus
   sebaceus corresponding to 175 patients were submitted to our institution
   between September 1987 and May 1992, and were identified among a total
   of 64,827 specimens. All cases were reviewed histopathologically and
   clinical information was obtained from the records. Specimens from 10
   patients were excluded.
   Results. A total of nine benign neoplasms (5.4\%) were identified in the
   165 patients. Three patients were in their second decade of life, two in
   their third, two in the fifth and two in the sixth. There were five
   trichoblastomas, three specimens of syringocystadenoma papilliferum, and
   one aprocrine cystadenoma. No malignant neoplasms were found. Six of the
   tumors were removed either for prophylactic or cosmetic reasons and in
   only three cases were the neoplasms suspected clinically and excised.
   Conclusions. If this same tendency prevails in other prospective
   studies, we strongly believe that prophylactic excision of all nevus
   sebaceus is not warranted. Excision should be recommended only when
   benign or malignant neoplasms are clinically suspected or for cosmetic
   considerations.}},

   Lp, isoA, and urine AMY. For each of these enzymes, a threshold value
   (twice to sixfold the upper limit of the reference values) offering
   diagnostic efficiency >95\% could be determined. In contrast, accuracy
   and efficiency of serum PLA were low. The profiles of these enzymes in
   acute pancreatitis decreased in a parallel fashion over 5 days except

Abstract = {{The use of oblique imagery for the extraction of man-made features, such
   as buildings for cartographic applications, introduces several problems
   to the process of stereo matching that are not present when traditional
   near-nadir imagery is used. When oblique imagery is brought into a
   collinear epipolar alignment, the ground-plane is usually not
   perpendicular to the camera axis, a simplifying assumption made with
   most near-nadir imagery.
   The obliquity of the ground-plane causes the greatest problem for stereo
   matchers. To accommodate the larger range of disparity, the stereo
   process must either increase its search window, or utilize an adaptive
   vergence mechanism to control the search window on a pixel-by-pixel
   basis. Increasing the search window increases both the search time and
   the chance for aliasing to occur. We show that adding an adaptive
   vergence mechanism to an existing stereo system provides a substantial
   improvement in its ability to process oblique imagery.}},

Abstract = {{Stratigraphic records preserved in the sediments of the mesohaline
   Chesapeake Bay were used to reconstruct a 2000-yr history of
   sedimentation, eutrophication, anoxia, and diatom community structure
   over time. Diatoms, pollen, total and organic carbon (TOC), total and
   organic nitrogen, total sulfur, acid-soluble iron, an estimate of the
   degree of pyritization of iron (DOP), and biogenic silica (BSi) were
   used as paleoecological indicators in four cores collected from a
   transect across the Chesapeake Bay from the Choptank River to Plum
   Point, Maryland. This paper covers results for diatoms, pollen, and BSi.
   Sediments were dated using radiocarbon and pollen techniques, and
   sedimentation rates were determined (0.2-5.8 mm/yr) using pollen
   methods. Geochemical indicators were measured and diatom species
   identified at subsampled intervals within each core. More than 400
   diatom species, primarily marine and estuarine taxa, were identified in
   the sediments, some for the first time.
   Analysis of the data indicates that sedimentation rates, eutrophication,
   turbidity, and anoxia have increased in the Chesapeake Bay since the
   time of European settlement of the watershed. There is also evidence
   that freshwater input to the mesohaline Chesapeake Bay has increased.
   Changes in diatom community structure and geochemical indicators reflect
   major changes in land use patterns of the watershed and increasing
   population. Diatom community diversity exhibits a continuing decline,
   while centric/pennate ratios rise dramatically in most recent sediments.}},

Abstract = {{The sol-gel process has been successfully applied to the preparation of

   1000 degrees C to form fine, hexagonal, CdS-microcrystal-doped glasses.
   The thermal treatments of samples were established by TDA/TGA analysis.
   Structural evolution of alkoxide silica during densification was
   followed by infrared spectroscopy. Samples were characterized using
   X-ray diffraction. The absorption spectra have also been measured and
   indicate the potential application of this material in optical devices.
   A simple quantum mechanical model has been used to calculate the

Abstract = {{Alpheus edwardsii Audouin and Alpheus lobidens de Man (Crustacea:
   Decapoda: Alpheidae) are two intertidal snapping shrimp that burrow in
   association with rocks. They are morphologically similar and are often
   found in the same intertidal zone. The competitive exclusion theory
   states that two co-existing species must partition resources. The
   partitioning of food items as a resource appears unlikely, as gut
   content analyses revealed that the two species have similar diets and
   the relationship of shrimp condition and shrimp density indicates that
   food supply was not in limited supply. Instead the two species partition
   the resources of space within the intertidal zone, and shelter. The two
   species were found to exist largely in isolation from each other.
   Alpheus edwardsii occurred across much of the intertidal zone. Within
   this range A. edwardsii were most abundant in substrata with a low
   proportion (<50\%) of mud. These substrata are better suited to their
   elaborate method of burrow construction. The simpler burrow construction
   method of A. lobidens allows this species the potential to occupy a wide
   range of substratum types; however, they were found only in muddy
   substrata with substantial surface rock cover at tidal elevations of 1 .
   18 m above datum or below. The restriction of A. lobidens to this region
   of the intertidal zone is probably related, in part, to their
   physiological requirements. In regions of co-occurrence, A. lobidens
   were significantly smaller than A. edwardsii, and utilized smaller rocks
   as shelters, thus avoiding direct interspecific competition for this
   resource. The absence of large A. lobidens from these areas may reflect
   their ability to procure shelter in competition with A. edwardsii, as
   behavioural experiments conducted in this study found that A. edwardsii
   were the dominant competitors for this resource.}},

   each examination. Marbofloxacin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid both
   yielded good bacteriological cure rates (96.2 per cent versus 85.0 per
   cent, respectively) and clinical cure rates (83.3 per cent versus 69.7
   per cent). Fewer relapses were observed in those dogs that received
   marbofloxacin. Few mild side effects were recorded with both products.}},

Abstract = {{A research program on intellectual discussion in academic institutions
   is presented as a case that illustrates a method for constructing
   grounded practical communication theory. Within a practical discipline
   perspective, theory is conceived as a rational reconstruction of
   practices for the purpose of informing further practice and reflection.
   The theoretical reconstruction of communication practices can be
   undertaken at three interrelated levels of analysis, here called the
   technical, problem, and philosophical levels. Based on interpretive
   discourse analysis of recorded departmental colloquia and interviews
   with participants, we identify a complex interactional dilemma that
   arises within this type of communicative situation (problem level),
   specific techniques by which participants attempt to cope with that
   dilemma (technical level), and two situated ideals to which they have
   recourse for reflecting on the normative basis of their own and others'
   actions (philosophical level). Because of the ways grounded practical
   theory differs from other theoretical approaches, we argue that existing
   criteria for evaluating theories must be rethought within this radically
   reflexive enterprise.}},

Abstract = {{NIDDM is the result of concomitant defects in both insulin secretion and
   insulin action. Although plasma insulin concentration in NIDDM patients
   may be normal or even increased as compared to normal individuals,
   insulin secretion is always impaired when related to ambient
   hyperglycemia. Moreover, the loss of first-phase insulin secretion is
   always present and it occurs at the very early stage of the disease. The
   defect in the early release of insulin may have quite an impact in
   post-prandial glucose homeostasis, due to inadequate suppression of
   hepatic glucose production. Therefore, insulin releasers should be able;
   1. to increase total insulin secretory capacity, and 2. to restore
   physiologic profile of insulin secretion. However, this is rarely
   achieved with the current therapeutical tools. Sulfonylureas may exert
   some suppressive action on the liver and may maintain a
   portal-peripheral venous insulin gradient. Metformin may improve insulin
   sensitivity but has no effect on the p-cell. Exogenous insulin exerts an
   inhibitory effect on hepatic glucose production but it does not maintain
   the physiologic gradient, neither can it mimic first-phase insulin
   secretion. Therefore, more appropriate tools must be sought. Prompt
   stimulation of insulin secretion can be elicited by
   alpha(2)-adrenoreceptor antagonists, but their clinical use is still
   under evaluation. New sulfonylureas are under development, though some
   of them may exert a better peripheral action than more potent
   stimulation of the beta-cell. Special interest has been focused on
   incretin peptides. Infusion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) in NIDDM
   patients improves glucose tolerance through enhancement of acute release
   of insulin, suppression of glucagon secretion, and improvement of
   peripheral glucose utilization. Finally, the possibility should be
   considered to reproduce rather than stimulate first-phase insulin
   secretion by s.c. injection of fast-acting insulin analogs. Whatever the
   mean will be used, restoration of first-phase insulin secretion may be
   expected to improve post-prandial glucose profile as a consequence of
   better modulation of hepatic glucose production. The reduced rise in
   post-prandial plasma glucose level is likely to relieve the challenge on
   the beta-cell so that a smoother second phase insulin secretion is
   obtained. In the long run, this may translate in an overall amelioration
   of glucose control while avoiding chronic hyperinsulinemia.}},

Abstract = {{Toxic substances may affect the life history of a species in a variety
   of ways. Different species maintain different priorities in coping with
   the physiological consequences of toxicant-induced stress. This is
   expressed by changes in energy allocation to different life-history
   characteristics which may have great consequences for the response at
   the population level. In this study the terrestrial invertebrates
   Platynothrus peltifer (Oribatida), Orchesella cincta, Folsomia candida
   (Collembola), and Porcellio scaber (lsopoda) were chosen to evaluate
   species-specific sensitivity of life histories. Effects on reproduction
   and weight increase under exposure to cadmium in the food were analyzed.
   The answer to the question of which species is the most sensitive
   depends on the parameter chosen. A comparison of sensitivity on the
   basis of sublethal effects showed P. peltifer to be the most sensitive
   species; on the basis of lethal effects however, the species O. cincta
   was the most sensitive. This discrepancy between effect parameters
   resulted in differences between the distance of the concentrations at
   which lethal and sublethal effects occur for different species. The
   ratio between the lethal effect concentration and the sublethal effect
   concentration is called the sublethal sensitivity index (SSI) and is
   proposed as a parameter expressing maintenance of sublethal functions
   under toxicant stress. The SSI seems to be a valuable parameter for
   evaluating the likelihood of population-level effects under toxicant
   stress. To extrapolate effects found in the laboratory to the field
   situation, more attention should be paid to the relationships between
   effects on life-history parameters and effects on population growth. (C)

Abstract = {{Since colchicine-sensitive microtubules regulate the expression and
   topographg of surface glycoproteins on a variety of cells, we sought
   evidence that colchicine interferes with neutrophil-endothelial
   interactions by altering the number and/or distribution of selectins on
   endothelial cells and neutrophils. Extremely low, prophylactic,
   concentrations of colchicine (IC50 = 3 nM) eliminated the
   E-selectin-mediated increment in endothelial adhesiveness for
   neutrophils in response to IL-1 (P < 0.001) or TNF alpha (P < 0.001) by
   changing the distribution, but not the number, of E-selectin molecules
   on the surface of the endothelial cells. Colchicine inhibited stimulated
   endothelial adhesiveness via its effects on microtubules since
   vinblastine, an agent which perturbs microtubule function by other
   mechanisms, diminished adhesiveness whereas the photoinactivated
   colchicine derivative gamma-lumicolchicine was inactive, Colchicine had
   no effect on cell viability, At higher, therapeutic, concentrations
   colchicine (IC50 = 300 nM, P < 0.001) also diminished the expression of
   L-selectin on the surface of neutrophils (but not lymphocytes) without
   affecting expression of the beta(2)-integrin CD11b/CD18, In
   confirmation, L-selectin expression was strikingly reduced (relative to
   CD11B/CD18) expression) on neutrophils from two individuals who had
   ingested therapeutic doses of colchicine. These results suggest that
   colchicine may exert ifs prophylactic effects on cytokine-provoked
   inflammation by diminishing the qualitative expression of E-selectin on
   endothelium, and its therapeutic effects by diminishing the quantitative
   expression of L-selectin on neutrophils.}},

Abstract = {{Most controlled studies in humans indicate that ranitidine does not
   alter theophylline metabolism, even at high doses. However, there have
   been several case reports published recently which demonstrate the
   development of theophylline toxicity mostly in older patients receiving
   stable oral doses of this drug when ranitidine was administered
   simultaneously. We studied eleven elderly (mean age, 69.0 +/- 6.2 years)
   patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). During one
   week the patients took slow-release theophylline, 200 mg every 12 h,
   followed by one week intake of the same dose of theophylline plus
   ranitidine tablets, 150 mg every 12 h. At the end of each period, blood
   samples were obtained 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 12 h after the
   morning dose for the determination of serum theophylline levels. The
   peak theophylline concentration (T-max) was achieved after 4.1 +/- 0.9 h
   while the patients were taking theophylline, and after 2.9 +/- 1.4 h
   with the combined regimen. This difference was statistically significant
   (P<0.01). In only 3/11 subjects did T-max remain unchanged during both
   phases of the study. The mean theophylline clearance rates while the
   patients were receiving theophylline alone (39.58 +/- 19.89 ml/min) and
   when they were receiving both medications (34.42 +/- 10.55 ml/min) were
   similar. The mean serum levels while the patients were receiving
   theophylline alone were slightly higher but not statistically different.
   These results suggest that the reported increases in serum theophylline
   levels in older patients receiving theophylline and ranitidine cannot be
   ascribed to slower theophylline metabolism in the geriatric patient with
   COPD who is also given ranitidine.}},

Abstract = {{The African fresh-water crab Sudanonautes africanus (A. Milne Edwards,
   1869) is redescribed from a large series of specimens from 5 countries.
   The species is redefined by a combination of characters of the carapace,
   chelipeds, and gonopod 1. The distribution of S. africanus is revised to
   include the coastal rain-forest regions of Nigeria and Central Africa
   (from south Cameroon to lower Zaire), and to exclude the West African
   region west of the river Niger in Nigeria. Sudanonautes africanus is one
   of the second intermediate hosts of the human lung fluke (Paragonimus).}},

Title = {{A finite difference approximation of the kinematic wave model of traffic

Abstract = {{This article shows that if the kinematic wave model of freeway traffic
   flow in its general form is approximated by a particular type of finite
   difference equation, the finite difference results converge to the
   kinematic wave solution despite the existence of shocks in the latter.
   This result, which applies to initial and boundary condition problems
   with and without discontinuous data, is shown not to hold for other
   commonly used finite difference schemes. In the proposed approximation,
   the flow between two neighboring lattice points is the minimum of the
   two values returned by: (a) a `'sending'' function evaluated at the
   density prevailing at the upstream lattice point and (b) a `'receiving''
   function evaluated at the downstream lattice point. The sending and
   receiving functions correspond to the increasing and decreasing branches
   of the freeway's flow-density curve. The article presents an asymptotic
   formula for the errors introduced by the proposed finite difference
   approximation and describes quantitatively the finite difference's
   shock-capturing behavior. Errors are shown to be approximately
   proportional to the mesh spacing with a coefficient of proportionality
   that depends on the wave speed, on its rate of change with density, and
   on the slope and curvature of the initial density profile. The
   asymptotic errors are smaller than those of Lax's first-order, centered
   difference method which is also convergent. More importantly though, the
   proposed procedure never yields negative flows, and this makes it
   attractive in practical engineering applications when the mesh cannot be
   made arbitrarily small.}},

Abstract = {{Atherosclerotic heart disease is the leading cause of death in patients
   with end stage renal disease, but its non invasive detection remains
   difficult because of a low efficacy of exercise testing. The aim of the
   study was to evaluate diagnostic accuracy of thallium myocardial imaging
   after dipyridamole combined with exercise. Forty two chronic dialysis
   patients (34 men, 8 women) aged 55 +/- 11 years (range: 36 to 75)
   without symptom of angina nor myocardial infarction were studied. In
   each patient, an echocardiography, a myocardial scintigraphy with
   dipyridamole combined with symptom-limited exercise, and coronarography
   were performed, A coronary heart disease was diagnosed by coronarography
   in 10 patients (4,5 and 1 respectively with 1, 2 and 3 vessels
   diseased). Echocardiography detected a left ventricular hypertrophy
   (LVH) in 26 patients and a regional asynergia in 14 patients. A positive
   scintigraphy was present in 11 patients. Three false-positive and 2
   false-negative on scintigraphy were noted. Sensibility, specificity,
   positive predictive value and negative predictive value were
   respectively evaluated at 80, 73, 73 and 93 \%. All the five patients
   with either false-positive or false negative scintigraphy exhibited a
   LVH. Conclusion, In chronic dialysis patients, coronary heart disease
   may be detected by thallium myocardial imaging after dipyridamole
   combined with exercise.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To test hypotheses based on clinical impressions that
   children with atopic dermatitis (AD) have frequent sleep-related
   problems, including difficulty falling asleep, night waking due to
   itching and scratching, and daytime symptoms of tiredness and
   irritability.
   Design: Sleep habits and behaviors were assessed using the Child Sleep
   Behavior Scale (a 22-item Likert-type questionnaire for parents) in
   children with AD compared with normative data for age. Twelve questions
   were added to the questionnaire to address sleep-related habits relevant
   to night time pruritus, and to assess daytime behavioral symptoms of
   inadequate sleep.
   Setting: Tertiary care center.
   Patients: Fifty-nine children between ages 5 and 12 years meeting
   criteria for AD representing a referral population to a regional center.
   Results: Compared with normative data, children with AD showed notable
   differences for nine of the 22 items on the sleep questionnaire,
   including the following: greater difficulty falling asleep, frequent
   night waking, less total sleep, and greater difficulty awakening for
   school. The children with AD also reported frequent daytime tiredness
   and irritability, and the severity of AD symptoms showed moderate
   correlations with sleep problems and with daytime behaviors suggestive
   of inadequate sleep. Difficulty falling asleep and night waking
   correlated with daytime behavior and discipline problems.
   Conclusions: Children with AD often have disrupted sleep and daytime
   behavioral difficulties associated with insufficient sleep. Improved
   sleep may be an important treatment focus in the clinical management of
   children with AD.}},

   general theory proposed by Cristescu (1994, Int. J. Plasticity 10(2),
   103-132). The yield function and viscoplastic potential are determined
   from the data obtained in creep tests. The procedure for the
   determination of the model parameters is directly related to the way in
   which the model is step by step build up. Comparisons between the model
   predictions and the experimental data will be shown.}},

Abstract = {{Two new computing models, namely a fuzzy expert system and a hybrid
   neural network-fuzzy expert system for time series forecasting of
   electric load, are presented in this paper. The fuzzy-logic-based expert
   system utilizes the historical relationship between load and dry-bulb
   temperature, and predicts electric loads fairly accurately, 1-24 h
   ahead. In the case of the hybrid neural network-fuzzy expert system, the
   input vector consists of the membership values of the linguistic
   properties of the past load and weather parameters, and the output
   vector is defined in terms of the fuzzy class membership values of the
   forecasted load. Linear and nonlinear adaptive fuzzy correction schemes
   are then used to augment the output from the neuro-fuzzy computing model
   to yield the final forecast. Extensive studies have been performed for
   load prediction for all seasons, and the results for a typical winter
   day are given to confirm the effectiveness of these models.}},

Abstract = {{Overexpression of the MDR1 product, P-glycoprotein (Pgp), has been shown
   to be one of the mechanisms underlying the development of multidrug
   resistance (MDR). Recently, one mutant p53 has been shown to stimulate
   the MDR1 gene promoter in vitro, whereas wild-type p53 repressed this
   activity. We measured Pgp and p53 expression by immunoblotting in 34
   colorectal tumours, and performed mutation analyses on the p53-positive
   tumours to confirm the presence of mutant p53 protein. Tumour DNA
   indices (DIs) were also measured using flow cytometry. Pgp was detected
   in 44\% (15/34) of the tumours and in 100\% (13/13) of the normal
   mucosas (P = 0.0005), with highest levels of expression seen in normal
   mucosa, suggesting that initial drug resistance in colorectal rumours is
   not caused by Pgp. Highly DNA aneuploid tumours demonstrated the lowest
   levels of Pgp expression relative to moderately aneuploid and diploid
   colorectal tumours. p53 protein was detected in 53\% (18/34) of the
   tumours, and 12 of 14 p53-positive tumours had p53 gene mutations.
   p53-negative tumours had approximately twice the level of Pgp expression
   of p53-positive tumours. Pgp expression was not associated with either
   p53 expression (P = 0.73) or incidence of p53 gene mutation (P = 0.70),
   suggesting that mutant p53 does not induce Pgp overexpression in
   colorectal carcinomas.}},

Abstract = {{Through-thickness crystallographic texture, defect structure, and
   tensile embrittlement of 35 mu m thick electrodeposit are characterized
   by successive thinning. An initially random grain structure, inherited
   from the substrate, evolves into a strong < 220 > fiber texture. The
   random to oriented grain transformation begins at the inception of
   thickening and is complete after about 15 mu m deposit thickness, where
   about 0.9 volume fraction of grains become oriented near < 220 >.
   Further thickening of the deposit sharpens the texture, reducing the
   scatter around the < 220 > ideal orientation. A duplex coarse/fine
   particle (coherent domain) structure is obtained. Coarse particles along
   < 220 > are less defective and have smaller lattice strains; fine
   particles along < 200 >, presumably associated with the random grains,
   are defect-saturated with finely spaced twins, high dislocation density
   and enhanced lattice strains. With increasing distance from the shiny
   surface (of initial film formation), especially following the initial 10
   mu m deposit thickness, (a) along < 220 >: particle size and twin
   spacing increase whereas dislocation density and root mean square (rms)
   strains decrease, (b) along < 200 >: particle size increases gradually,
   dislocation density and rms strains increase sharply and the already
   fine twin spacing remains unchanged, and (c) the effective particle size
   ratio D-eff< 220 >:D-eff< 200 > exceeds 1.4, suggesting a
   twinning-induced z-direction particle shape anisotropy. A substantial
   decrease in tensile elongation is observed at 180 degrees C. The
   embrittlement increases with the deposit thickness, attributed to the
   development of low density regions in the morphological boundaries. High
   elongation and embrittlement directional anisotropies are observed near
   the shiny surface, perhaps due to preferred nucleation on the substrate
   asperities.}},

Abstract = {{Athletes in sprint events use various mental and physical starling
   strategies prior to beginning a race. Included among these strategies
   are sensory-set and motor-set strategies. A sensory-set strategy is one
   in which the athlete concentrates on reacting as fast as possible to an
   auditory or visual stimulus. A motor-set strategy is one in which the
   athlete consciously attends to a component of a well-learned skill
   rather than to the stimulus which evokes the initiation of the skill.
   The purpose of this study was to observe differences in starling
   techniques of 20 championship cyclists in the one-kilometer time-trial
   sprint race. Analysis showed that 10 highly proficient cyclists
   responded significantly faster after the auditory stimulus and recorded
   faster 1/2-lap split times than 10 proficient cyclists. Strategy
   selection and use of elite cyclists should be investigated further to
   examine efficient starting strategies and procedures.}},

Abstract = {{Thrombospondins are a family of extracellular matrix proteins expressed
   throughout the developing nervous system that promote neurite outgrowth
   in vitro and help mediate the migration of granule cells across the
   molecular layer in explants of neonatal cerebellum. The receptors
   mediating these interactions have not previously been identified. In
   this study, monoclonal antibodies raised to the integrin alpha(3)
   beta(1) heterodimer are shown to inhibit neurite outgrowth by rat
   sympathetic neurons on thrombospondin-1. alpha(3) beta(1) is found to be
   expressed on the cell body, neurites, and growth cones of sympathetic
   neurons in vitro and on sympathetic axons passing through the
   thrombospondin-rich outer sheath of the superior cervical ganglion in
   vivo, consistent with its role in mediating axon outgrowth. A
   receptor-ligand binding assay is used to demonstrate the direct binding
   of immunopurified alpha(3) beta(1) to thrombospondin-1. These results
   demonstrate a direct interaction between the integrin alpha(3) beta(1)

Abstract = {{A new surfactant with a branched monoalkyl chain and a malonate
   headgroup has been synthesized: 2-(4-butyloctyl)malonic acid (BOMA).
   From the geometry of the surfactant, reflected in a packing parameter
   (P), it was anticipated that the surfactant would preferably aggregate
   in bilayers. This expectation was borne out in practice by the
   aggregation behavior, as studied by transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM) with negatively stained samples and freeze-fracture samples of
   aqueous vesicle dispersions. The structure of the surfactant headgroup
   has been varied by changes in pH of the vesicle dispersions. Over a wide
   pH range (pH 2.8-12.8) small unilamellar vesicles with a size of 20-50
   nm were observed. Multilamellar vesicles were observed as well in the pH
   range 2.8-5.1. Phase-penetration experiments using an optical
   polarization microscope showed the birth and growth of myelins and
   multilamellar vesicles over a pH range 1.5-13.1. At pH < 2.8, a phase
   separation occured into a surfactant-rich, optically isotropic phase and
   a surfactant-lean phase. The physical and colloidal stability of the
   vesicular aggregates is high: up to one year as confirmed by TEM. The
   fusogenic properties of BOMA vesicles were examined. Upon the addition
   of Ca2+ ions, aggregates tended to become larger, but the formation of
   Ca2+ surfactant crystals was also observed.}},

Abstract = {{A rapidly spinning, slowly accreting magnetic white dwarf (or X-ray

   result of the stretching and reconnection of magnetic field lines,
   leading to particle acceleration at the magnetospheric radius outside
   the corotation radius, and the propeller type ejection of magnetized
   synchrotron-emitting clouds. This may explain the non-thermal (radio and
   gamma-rays) emission seen from the unique nearby AE Aquarii. Moving to
   Galactic distances we show how TeV gamma-ray observations of
   pulsar-driven supernova remnants (with well-measured synchrotron X-ray
   spectra) allow us to obtain a direct measurement of the average magnetic
   field strength in the nebula. Finally, GeV to TeV observations of
   gamma-ray blazars out to redshifts of similar to 2 allow us to probe the

Abstract = {{The emergence of advanced multimedia applications is emphasizing the
   relevance of retrieval by contents within databases of images and image
   sequences. Matching the inherent visuality of the Information stored in
   such databases, visual specification by example provides an effective
   and natural way to express content-oriented queries. To support this
   querying approach, the system must be able to interpret example scenes
   reproducing the contents of images and sequences to be retrieved, and to
   match them against the actual contents of the database. In the
   accomplishment of this task, to avoid a direct access to raw image data,
   the system must be provided with an appropriate description language
   supporting the representation of the contents of pictorial data.
   An original language for the symbolic representation of the contents of

Abstract = {{Parvalbumin (PARV) belongs to the family of calcium-binding proteins
   bearing the EF hand domain. Immunocytochemical studies in the cerebral
   cortex have demonstrated that neurons containing PARV include two types
   of GABAergic interneurons, namely, basket and axo-axonic chandelier
   cells. The present study examines the onset and pattern of PARV mRNA
   expression during the development of rat neocortex and hippocampus by
   means of `in situ' hybridization with an oligonucleotide probe
   corresponding to rat PARV cDNA. In animals aged P0-P6 no signal was
   detected above background in neocortex or hippocampus. At P8, a few
   cortical cells displayed a number of silver grains just above background
   levels. By P10 PARV mRNA-expressing cells in the neocortex were detected
   almost exclusively in layer V of somatosensory, frontal and cingulate
   cortices. At P12 PARV mRNA was mainly detected in layers IV, V and Via.
   By P14 there was a marked overall increase in the entire neocortex,
   including layer II-III, both in the number of cells and in their
   intensity of labelling. Further maturation in the pattern of PARV mRNA
   concentration was observed between P16 and P21. In the hippocampus low
   hybridization was observed at P10-P12. In subsequent stages both the
   number of positive cells and the intensity of labelling increased
   steadily. No clear-cut radial gradients for the expression of PARV mRNA
   were observed in the hippocampal region. Our results show that the
   developmental radial gradient followed by PARV mRNA expression in the
   neocortex does not follow an `inside-out' gradient, consistent with
   previous immunocytochemical findings. Taken together, these data
   indicate that the developmental sequence followed by the PARV protein
   directly reflects mRNA abundance and suggest that PARV mRNA expression
   correlates with the functional maturation of cortical interneurons.}},

Journal = {{CARDIOVASCULAR RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Systolic and diastolic dysfunction of the failing human
   heart may be due to changes in myocyte function, or to extracellular
   influences such as necrosis, fibrosis or repositioning of viable cells.
   In order to determine the contribution of cellular factors we have
   characterised the contraction amplitudes, and contraction and relaxation
   velocities of single myocytes isolated from failing human left
   ventricle. Methods: Myocytes were enzymatically isolated from the left
   ventricles of 42 subjects, superfused at 32 degrees C and paced at 0.2
   Hz. Using a video/edge tracking system we obtained contraction amplitude
   and contraction and relaxation velocities as well as times to peak
   contraction (TTP) and to 50\% and 90\% relaxation (R50 and R90).
   Concentration-response curves to Ca2+ were constructed for each cell.
   Results: There was little difference in contraction amplitude at any
   Ca2+ concentration between cells from failing and non-failing hearts at
   this low frequency. At maximally activating Ca2+ concentrations (6-20
   mM) there was a 30\% slowing of relaxation velocity in myocytes from
   patients with both mild-moderate (P < 0.001) and severe (P < 0.001)
   congestive heart failure. Contraction and relaxation times were
   increased in myocytes from failing hearts {[}TTP: 0.46 +/- 0.02 s (n =
   34 patients) vs. 0.35 +/- 0.02 s (n = 6), P < 0.01 and R50: 0.25 +/-
   0.02 s (n = 34) vs. 0.16 +/- 0.02 s (n = 6), P < 0.001]. Impaired
   relaxation was seen with most etiologies, including ischemic and dilated
   cardiomyopathies and mitral valve disease. Myocytes from failing
   hypertrophied ventricles were more severely affected than those from
   failing non-hypertrophied hearts for both contraction and relaxation
   velocities. Cells from failing hypertrophied ventricles had a
   significantly larger area than from non-failing or failing
   non-hypertrophied ventricles, although cell length and sarcomere length
   were similar between groups. Larger myocytes did not show a more
   pronounced change in relaxation velocity than normally sized cells from
   the same hypertrophied ventricle. Conclusions: Significant impairment of
   relaxation can be observed in ventricular myocytes from failing human
   heart under conditions where contraction amplitude appears normal. The
   defect is not confined to one etiology of disease, but is exacerbated
   during hypertrophy. An increase in cell size, although observed in
   myocytes from hypertrophied ventricle, does not itself account for
   changes in relaxation. Cellular changes contribute to diastolic
   dysfunction in the failing human heart.}},

Abstract = {{Dihaploids obtained from a somatically chromosome-doubled dihaploid
   potato were crossed with Solanum phureja clones. To test the effect of
   inbreeding, measurements were made of their seed production and the
   tuber yield, tuber number and mean tuber weight of their offspring. On
   average, seed production of the second generation dihaploids was higher
   than that of the original dihaploid progenitor. Progeny tuber yield and
   its components were little different from those of the original
   dihaploid's progeny. Tuber flesh quality, as measured by lack of
   blemishes, was better in the offspring of second generation dihaploids.
   It is suggested that the negative effects of producing second generation
   dihaploids are minor compared with producing the first generation
   dihaploid from a tetraploid, because most deleterious recessives have
   already been unmasked. The results indicated residual variation within
   the original dihaploid which could be exploited for plant breeding
   purposes.
   An indicator of inbred status, alternative to the inbreeding
   coefficient, is suggested which could be applied to both diploids and

   min(-1)), and a combined glucose plus lipid infusion (5.5 mg . kg(-1).
   min(-1) glucose + 2.5 mg . kg(-1). min(-1) lipid). Leucine R, was not

   Intravenous lipid infusion alone neither suppressed nor increased

   glucose provided either alone or in combination with lipid; this
   suppression was achieved at glucose concentrations of similar to 90
   mg/dl and insulin concentrations of similar to 6 mu U/ml. Thus normal
   newborns respond to intravenous glucose with sustained nearly complete
   suppression of glucose production, even at moderate levels of glycemia

   infusion does not result in suppression of proteolysis. It remains
   unclear to what extent any potential regulator can suppress proteolysis

Abstract = {{Purpose: To study whether there is a relationship between transplanted
   cell dose and rate of hematopoietic recovery after peripheral-blood
   stem-cell (PBSC) transplantation, and to obtain an indication whether
   specific subsets of CD34(+) cell populations contribute to rapid
   recovery of neutrophils or platelets.
   Patients and Methods: based on data from 59 patients, we calculated for
   each day after PBSC transplantation the dose of CD34(+) cells that
   resulted in rapid recovery of either neutrophils or platelets in the
   majority (> 70\%) of patients. Using dual-color how cytometry, subsets
   of peripheral-blood CD34(+) cells were quantified and the numbers of
   CD34(+) cells belonging to each of the reinfused subsets correlated with
   hematopoietic recovery following high-dose chemotherapy.
   Results: The calculated threshold values with a high probability of
   engraftment showed a steep dose-effect relationship between CD34(+) cell
   dose and time to recovery of both neutrophils or platelets.
   predominantly CD34(+) cells with the phenotype of myeloid precursors
   were mobilized. A minority of CD34(+) cells expressed the erythroid and
   megakaryocytic lineage-associated antigens and ct low but distinct
   population of CD34(+) cells expressed antigens associated with
   multipotent stem cells. Analysis showed that the number of
   CD34(+)CD33(-) cells (r = -.74, P < .05), as well as the number of
   CD34(+)CD41(+) cells (r = -.81, P < .005), correlated significantly
   better with time to neutrophil and platelet recovery, respectively, than
   with the total number of CD34(+) cells (r = -.55 and r = -.56,
   respectively).
   Conclusion: The numbers of CD34(+)CD33(-) cells and CD34(+)CD41(+) cells
   may help to predict short-term repopulation capacity of pBSCs,
   especially when relatively low numbers of CD34(+) cells per kilogram are
   reinfused.

Abstract = {{The objective of the experiments was to investigate the influence of the
   duration of exposure to different environmental temperatures on the heat
   production (HP) of growing pigs. 5 trials were carried out with Landrace
   castrated male pigs at temperatures of 6, 12, 18, 24 and 30 degrees C.
   Each trial lasted 9 weeks and four animals with an initial live weight
   (LW) of 47 +/- 2.5 kg were involved. The animals were housed
   individually. The diet contained 15 MJ ME/kg DM and 19\% crude protein.
   The feeding level was 2.9-times maintenance energy requirement. HP of
   the pigs kept at 6 and 12 degrees C was higher than in pigs kept at 18,
   24 and 30 degrees C. Over the time of the experiment HP decreased in all
   cases, but the extent of the decrease was higher at 6 and 12 degrees C
   (15 and 17\%, respectively). The coefficients of a regression relating
   daily HP (all values adjusted to a ME intake of 1292 kJ/kg LW(0.75). d)
   to time (week) were: -21.5 (6 degrees C); -20.3 (12 degrees C); -4.2 (18
   degrees C); -6.5 (24 degrees C); -5.3 (30 degrees C) kJ/kg LW(0.75). d .
   week. It was concluded that over the time of the trials a reduction of
   the thermoregulatory part of the HP takes place. Investigations on the
   morphology of the body core after slaughter showed a marked increase of
   longer bristles of the pigs kept at 12 degrees C, than in pigs kept at
   24 degrees C. The thickness of dorsal fat was also higher. The results
   show that an important mechanism of acclimation to a cold environment in
   pigs is the increasing body insulation which leads to a reduction of
   energy losses for thermoregulatory responses.}},

   Intensity data up to sin theta/lambda = 1.14 Angstrom(-1) have been

   analysis, up to the octopole level for C and O atoms, and to quadrupoles

   coordinates of the heavy atoms which are better than 0.0004 Angstrom.
   Root mean square (r.m.s.) amplitudes of vibration for C and O atoms have
   been determined to a precision of ca 0.0006 Angstrom. Based on the
   least-squares sigma's, uncertainties for the C-C and C-O bond lengths
   are 0.0005 Angstrom, and those of the C-H bond distances 0.006-0.007
   Angstrom. The topological properties of the experimentally derived
   charge density of the annulene molecule in the crystal have been
   determined by evaluating the location and nature of its critical points
   (points where del rho = 0). Contour maps of rho(exp) and its negative
   Laplacian (-del(2) rho(exp)) are presented. The occurrence of a bond

Abstract = {{Cultivated sorghum (Sorghum bicolor ssp. bicolor) is classified into
   five main races on the basis of spikelet morphology. Isozyme analyses
   provided new insight into the genetic diversity of sorghum and revealed
   marked geographic grouping, while nuclear restriction fragment length
   polymorphisms showed racial differentiation and intraguinea race
   differentiation. Wild sorghum is diploid or tetraploid and African
   sorghum (S. bicolor ssp. arundinaceum) is classified into four races,
   that are considered to be progenitors of cultivated sorghum. We
   performed mitochondrial DNA analyses to compare the diversity of wild
   and cultivated sorghum and to study the genetic origin of guinea
   margaritiferum. The same overall patterns were obtained with the
   different phenogram construction techniques. Our results confirmed the
   specificity of guinea margaritiferum and demonstrated the presence of
   two generic entities within this subrace. Another guinea group was also
   noted, which corresponded to Asian guinea roxburghii. In wild sorghum,
   the arundinaceum race appeared to be homogenous, while the
   verticilliflorum race was separated into two groups, one of which was
   associated with the arundinaceum race. The diversity observed in
   cultivated forms was found to be encompassed within the wild pool,
   except for one guinea margaritiferum group. There did not seem to be any
   particular relationship between wild races and cultivated races.}},

Abstract = {{The use of the colicin A lysis protein to direct the extracellular
   release of a fusion protein from Escherichia coli was investigated as an
   approach for the preparation of recombinant animal toxins. Apamin, a bee
   venom neurotoxin, was used as the model toxin. It is reticulated by two
   disulfide bridges and interacts with small conductance Ca2+-activated K+
   channels. Substantial amounts of free recombinant apamin were obtained
   by CNBr cleavage of the fusion protein {[}col-(1-171)-apa] and HPLC
   purification. It was recognized by conformation-dependent monoclonal
   antibodies with a K-0.5 value close to that for natural apamin,
   indicating that folding was correct. In toxicity and binding
   experiments, the recombinant apamin displayed low activity. The
   recombinant and natural molecules differed by the amidation of the
   C-terminal histidine residue. Previous structure/activity relationship
   studies do not implicate this C-terminal residue in activity but the
   role of its amidation was not investigated. An apamin analog with a
   non-amidated C-terminal residue was then chemically synthesized. The
   biological properties of both recombinant and chemical molecules were
   determined. Amidation of the C-terminal alpha-carboxyl of apamin appears
   to be essential for full expression of its biological activity.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this cohort study was to evaluate the concordance of the

   consecutive long-stay nursing home residents at one academic department
   of the V.A. and in 8 community proprietary nursing homes in San Antonio,
   Texas. They were to have more than 3 months residency; to be greater
   than or equal to 61 years; and to be dependent in at least 2 ADLs with
   an MMSE score of greater than or equal to 15. Subjects were administered
   a 128-item SIP and a reduced 66-item SIP-NH at baseline and 4, 8, and
   12-month follow-up. At each follow-up, subjects were classified into 3
   mutually exclusive change categories using a change score of greater
   than or equal to 5 points. Concordance of the classification of subjects
   by the SIP-NH an SIP was evaluated. The misclassification rate as well
   as its direction was also assessed. Both instruments classified a little
   over one-quarter of the subjects as better, over a third as being
   unchanged, and another third as being worse at the four-month follow-up.
   More subjects were classified as worse by both in struments at 8 and 12
   months. All kappas ranged from 0.52 to 0.78, indicating good to
   excellent agreement. Overall, the SIP-NH characterized persons as
   changed more often than the SIP with no systematic directional bias. In
   conclusion, the SIP-NH was concordant with the SIP in classifying change
   in subjects. However, Lye cannot say which of the two is better for
   detecting change. Future research must focus on defining a change score
   which has clinical meaning, and evaluate responsiveness to change.}},

   testability constraints. Testability at behavioural level can be
   enhanced by minimising the number of self-adjacent registers
   (self-loops). The main objective is to minimise the testability overhead
   (area and delay) while searching the design-space to provide a self-loop
   free architecture. Experiments on benchmarks show that self-loops can be
   eliminated with minimum additional hardware resources.}},

Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1393-1400}},

Abstract = {{Tolerance of toxicant exposure is common in polluted sites in nature.
   However, in most cases, the processes underlying tolerance acquisition
   are not well understood. In the case of exposure to polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs) in particular, reports are lacking on the capacity
   for tolerance acquisition. To evaluate the potential for adaptation to
   this class of contaminants we exposed a large laboratory population of
   fathead minnows to fluoranthene, commonly a major constituent of PAH
   contamination. The exposure concentration chosen did not cause mortality
   but was sufficient to diminish reproductive capacity in exposed breeding
   fish relative to a control population. This level of exposure also
   significantly diminished hatching success and larval survivorship in the
   exposed population. The estimated value of selection against
   susceptibility (the product of all assessments of effect) was 0.67.
   Tests for tolerance acquisition included comparative larval 96-h LC50
   determinations, and comparative juvenile median time to death (LT50)
   determinations. Enhanced tolerance was not apparent in the LC50
   determinations, although an examination of the concentration-response
   distribution suggested an adverse effect due to egg and larval exposure
   to fluoranthene prior to the test. In contrast, results of the
   comparative LT50 determination indicated that the exposed population was
   approximately 30\% more tolerant, relative to the control population,
   when exposed to an acutely toxic concentration of fluoranthene. These
   results suggest that tolerance to PAH exposure can occur in nature and
   that this population-level response needs to be examined relative to
   other recognized effects in PAH-contaminated areas.}},

   of the monthly weight and length of fully breast-fed infants with the

   reference data showed the adequacy of breast-feeding to support infant
   growth. When mothers and infants are healthy, breast milk is sufficient
   to support adequate infant growth and health during the first months of
   life. The main variables that affect the duration of breast-feeding,
   nutrition and suckling frequency, are susceptible to interventions by

Abstract = {{THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY was to assess the effectiveness of surgical
   debridement versus various guided tissue regeneration techniques for the
   treatment of localized juvenile periodontitis (LJP). Seven patients, 14
   to 18 years old, were selected on the basis of having: 1) vertical bone
   loss on at least 3 first molars; 2) probing attachment loss greater than
   or equal to 5 mm; 3) presence of Actinobacillus actinomycetecomitans (A
   alpha) as determined by the DNA probe test; 4) no systemic diseases; and
   5) not taken antibiotics for 6 months prior to treatment. Each patient
   was randomly assigned by first molar involvement to one of four
   treatment modalities: 1) surgical debridement alone (DEBR); 2) ePTFE
   membrane alone (G); 3) ePTFE membrane plus root conditioning (G+D); or
   4) ePTFE membrane plus root conditioning plus composite graft (G+D+B).
   Standardized clinical attachment level measurements (GAL) were taken at
   baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. Hard tissue measurements were evaluated
   radiographically (RAD) at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months, and
   volumetrically at baseline and 12 months postsurgery. At 12 months
   re-entry, all residual defects were re-treated with a composite graft
   consisting of calcium sulfate + DFDBA + doxycycline. Results were
   evaluated 6 months post-retreatment using CAL and RAD measurements.
   Statistical analysis of the data showed: 1) a significant gain in
   clinical attachment as well as Increased volumetric bone fill of the
   defects 12 and 18 months following the various treatment modalities when
   compared to baseline (P < 0.05); and 2) no statistically significant
   differences among the tested treatment modalities and surgical
   debridement alone for all parameters (P > 0.05). It may be concluded
   that surgical debridement in conjunction with systemic administration of
   doxycycline is as effective as regenerative techniques in treating
   patients with LJP.}},

   Besides the necessary steric complementarity it could be shown that the
   interaction between the methyl groups of aromatic guests (e.g. toluene)
   and the aromatic walls of the host is essential for host-guest
   complexation. These phenomena get more pronounced if bicyclic
   cyclophanes are applied and these sensitive materials enable the
   detection of only a few ppm of toluene with SAW devices. Furtheron. the
   electron-rich diphenylether moieties of these hosts guarantee
   interactions with electron-deficiency analytes such as chlorinated
   hydrocarbons with a selectivity superior to that of the monocyclic

Abstract = {{The Lower and Middle Jurassic Laberge Group consists of conglomerates,
   sandstone turbidites and shales that were deposited within a deep-water
   fore-are trough. The conglomerate of the Laberge Group accounts for most
   of the preserved basin-fill within the Whitehorse Trough, and was
   derived from exhumed plutons, comprising multiple intrusives and
   extrusives of varying composition, that formed an island are terrane in
   the western margin of the Whitehorse Trough. The island are complex
   docked against North America in the Late Triassic and the Laberge
   conglomerates record the sedimentary and unroofing processes that
   predominated in the intervening trough during are-continent collision
   and accretion. Coarse-grained sediment shed from the are constructed fan
   deltas along the western margin of the basin. These deposits were
   resedimented into deep water (below wave base) through shelf-break
   chutes and submarine channels. Gravel was emplaced within submarine
   channel-and-fan complexes; sandy turbidites formed lobes along the
   margins of the gravelly submarine fans and muds were deposited in
   inter-fan settings. Stratigraphic changes within the Laberge Group
   reflect: (1) collision of the are, with plutonism and resultant uplift,
   and subsequent unroofing of the are highlands; and (2) overlap of
   coarse-grained deep-water fans across the shelf as a response of crustal
   flexure to collisional tectonism and/or a eustatic sea-level change.
   Later deposition of the overlying Tantalus Formation records a
   diachronous overlap of successor paralic-alluvial deposits over the
   Laberge sediments associated with final-stage accretion events in the
   Whitehorse Trough.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we report the presence and function of the 5' untranslated

   (GGT) in three different hematopoietic cell lines (HL-60, U-937 and
   K-562) as well as in the RNA of the leukocyte fraction from six acute
   lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL). Results obtained by RNase protection
   analysis demonstrate the presence of a unique form of 5'UTR expressed in
   most human tissues. In order to investigate the possible role of this
   type of sequence on regulation of GGT in hematopoietic cells, plasmid
   constructs carrying human hepatoma GGT 5'UTR and a luciferase reporter
   gene were transfected into the three blood cell lines. Compared to
   control untransfected cells, transfected HL-60 and K-562 showed a
   decrease in reporter gene activity of 51 and 73\%, respectively. In
   contrast, transfected U-937 showed a 139\% increase of reporter gene
   activity. Results were compared to GGT activity in the relevant cells

   shape of the gland were graded and its signal intensity measured.
   RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference in the signal
   intensity of both the anterior and posterior pituitary gland and in the
   shape between children younger than and older than 6 weeks of age and
   younger than and older than 27 weeks of age. There were definite trends
   in the size of the gland with age (decrease in height and increase in
   anteroposterior diameter and width). CONCLUSIONS: There are changes in
   the pituitary gland in the newborn period that may reflect the ongoing
   changes in pituitary hormones reported to occur during this time.}},

Abstract = {{A hyperosmotic solution of mannitol or glucose (100 mM) in pond water
   caused an increase in paracellular solute movement; between the bathing
   medium and body fluids of Dreissena polymorpha. Small molecules (<5,000
   Dal in the bath entered the mussel, and 80-85\% of the sodium and
   chloride in the blood was lost within 12 h. Blood total solute was
   elevated within 4 h of exposure to hyperosmotic conditions, but the rise
   was attributed to the gain of glucose or mannitol from the bath and not
   to an elevation of ion concentration as a result of the osmotic loss of
   water. Lanthanum in the bathing solution was able to penetrate the
   paracellular junctional complex between gill epithelial cells in mussels
   exposed to hyperosmotic conditions but was rarely observed in pond
   water-acclimated animals. Colloidal gold (6 nm diam) was unable to
   penetrate the paracellular space but was accumulated in endocytotic
   vesicles in many epithelial cells. The `'leakiness'' of the epithelial
   tissue may be a critical factor in the low blood solute concentrations
   in freshwater mussels despite high rates of ion transport in these

Abstract = {{A mixed micellar assay was used to study the in vitro binding of
   {[}H-3]phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate ({[}H-3]PDBu) to pure recombinant
   protein kinase C (PKC)-alpha, -beta(1), -beta(2), -gamma, -delta,
   -epsilon, and -zeta isotypes expressed in the baculovirus/insect cell
   system. Scatchard analysis revealed that all isotypes except PKC-zeta
   were able to specifically bind PDBu, with K-d values ranging from 1.6 to
   18 nM in the presence of calcium. In the absence of calcium PKC-alpha,
   -beta(1), -beta(2), and -delta were observed to have a 2-3-fold drop in
   affinity, although B-max values remained unchanged, at a stoichiometry
   of 1.4-2.8 mol of PDBu/mol of enzyme. Competition with specific
   {[}3H]PDBu binding was assessed for the phorbol esters PDBu,
   12-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-O-acetate,
   12-deoxyphorbol-13-O-phenylacetate,
   12-deoxyphorbol-13-O-phenylacetate-20-acetate, thymeleatoxin,
   resiniferatoxin, and sapintoxin A. Resiniferatoxin and
   12-deoxyphorbol-13-O-phenylacetate-20-acetate were found to compete
   effectively only with PDBu bound to the PKC-beta(1) and -beta(2)
   isotypes and were the least potent of the phorbol esters tested (IC50, >
   5 mu M). The phorbol esters sapintoxin A,
   12-deoxyphorbol-13-O-phenylacetate,
   12-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-O-acetate, and PDBu (in order of potency)
   competed for binding to all isotypes (IC50 values ranging from 2 to 70
   nM), with unchanged or slightly decreased potency when calcium was
   replaced by ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl
   ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid. Thymeleatoxin, which was similar in
   other respects to these potent phorbol esters, was found to be less able
   to compete with binding to PKC-alpha and -epsilon isotypes (IC50, 3-5 mu
   M). It appears that, whereas the binding of phorbol esters to PKC
   depends primarily on the C20 substituent, other areas of the molecule
   have an influence on this interaction and the PKC isotypes themselves
   display heterogeneity in their phorbol ester-binding characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{In a preliminary study, acoustic distortion was assessed as a measure of
   cochlear function in both implanted and contralateral ears of
   electrically stimulated guinea pigs. Prestimulation distortion levels in
   implanted ears were below those of unimplanted ears and below those
   previously reported for guinea pigs. This may have been due to the
   mechanical or irritant effect of the electrode. In both the ipsilateral
   and contralateral ears of stimulated animals, distortion levels were
   depressed during the period of electrical stimulation. In addition, the
   slope of distortion growth as a function of stimulus level was more
   gradual in stimulated ears and contralateral ears of the same animals
   for f2 = 6 kHz and 9 kHz, but was unaffected for f2 = 3 kHz. When the
   distortion could no longer be recorded in the stimulated ear (4
   subjects) or contralateral ear (1 subject) the animal was killed and
   histological evaluation carried out in both ears. Histological changes
   were restricted mainly to the efferent terminals in those ears where
   some distortion was still recordable. In one animal where distortion had
   become unmeasurable immediately prior to death, the outer hair cells
   were severely damaged and undergoing lysis. In this preliminary study,
   intersubject and between-test variability in distortion for implanted
   (ipsilateral) ears indicated that additional controls are necessary to
   establish the validity of alterations in acoustic distortion to reflect
   cochlear pathology.}},

   rapid, but not enough to topple the crinoids, and occurred as a series

Abstract = {{Giant motion-sensitive tangential neurons in the lobula plate are
   thought to be cardinal elements in the oculomotor pathways of flies.
   However, these large neurons do not themselves compute motion, and
   elementary motion detectors have been proposed only from theory. Here we
   identify the forms, projections, and responses of small-field
   retinotopic neurons that comprise a well known pathway from the retina
   to the lobula plate. Already at the level of the second and third
   synapses beneath the photoreceptor layer, certain of these small
   elements show responses that distinguish motion from flicker. At a level
   equivalent to the vertebrate inner plexiform layer (the fly's outer
   medulla) at least one retinotopic element is directionally selective. At
   the inner medulla, small retinotopic neurons with bushy dendrites
   extending through a few neighboring columns leave the inner medulla and
   supply inputs onto lobula plate tangentials. These medulla relays have
   directionally selective responses that are indistinguishable from those
   of large-field tangentials except for their amplitude and modulation
   with contrast frequency. Centrifugal neurons leading back from the inner
   medulla out to the lamina also show orientation-selective responses to
   motion. The results suggest that specific cell types between the lamina
   and inner medulla correspond to stages of the Hassenstein-Reichardt
   correlation model of motion detection.}},

   radiation (WR)-induced melanogenesis (tanning) in Skh:HR2 pigmented
   hairless mice. Topically pretreated mice were exposed to subminimal
   edematogenic as well as edematogenic WR doses to establish whether
   W-7-UVR-induced edema prophylaxis allows increased melanogenesis while
   preventing edema. Ultraviolet light-irradiated vehicle control animals
   developed visible tans; however, both W-7-treated groups failed to tan.
   Topical W-7 before UVR exposure inhibited UVR induction of dopa oxidase
   activity in melanocytes by 49\% (P=0.029) and inhibited UVR-induced
   deposition of melanin in the epidermis by 88\% (P=0,006). Topical W-7
   blocked 23\% of the UVR but this blockage could not account for the
   inhibition of dopa oxidase and melanization, We conclude that, in
   addition to preventing edema, W-7 inhibits WR-induced melanogenesis,
   possibly by affecting Ca2+-calmodulin and/or protein kinase C-dependent
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{N'-{[}tris(hydroxymethyl)]methyl-4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine was fed in
   the diet to groups of 30 male and 55 female Sprague-Dawley rats at
   levels of 0.2, 0.6 and 2.0\% for up to 6 months. One mid-dose and two
   high-dose females developed palpable mammary masses that were
   subsequently diagnosed as mammary adenocarcinomas at a 13-wk interim
   kill involving 10 rats/sex/group. After 14 wk, 25 females per group with
   no apparent masses were mated in a reproduction/teratology study.
   Mammary tumours developed in a dose-related fashion both in the pregnant
   rats and in the remaining 20 females/group that continued on treatment
   for 6 months. On gestation day 20 (wk 17-18) the final incidences of
   mammary adenocarcinomas in the low-, mid- and high-dose mated dose
   groups were 20, 60 and 84\%, respectively, while the corresponding
   incidences in the non-mated females at 6 months were 5, 40 and 85\%.
   Most mammary tumours were encapsulated but, at 6 months, lung metastases
   were noted in four rats, and four females also had Zymbal's gland
   tumours. Non-neoplastic changes in male and female rats considered to be
   related to treatment included increases in thyroid follicular cell size
   accompanied by an accumulation of golden-brown pigment, multifocal
   hepatic necrosis with non-suppurative inflammation, and renal tubular
   pigmentation. Increases in foetal variations in the mid- and high-dose
   groups were considered to be related non-specifically to retarded
   growth. Malformations observed in the high-dose group were found
   primarily in single foetuses and were not considered to be treatment
   related. Although the mean numbers of micronucleated polychromatic
   erythrocytes in bone marrow obtained from high-dose treated females
   after 13 wk slightly exceeded historical negative control values, the
   data were not considered indicative of a genotoxic effect because of the
   absence of either a dose relationship or a substantive increase in the
   frequency of micronucleated cells.}},

   determinations of In-2.24(NCN)(3) (rhombohedral R (\$) over bar 3c, a =
   606.09(4), c = 2884.4(2) pm, Z = 6) and NaIn(NCN)(2) (orthorhombic Cmcm,
   a = 961.30(6), b = 716.84(5), c = 603.65(4) pm, Z = 4) reveal ionic
   layer structures built from sheets of cationic and anionic (cyanamide)
   motifs. While NaIn(NCN)(2) contains In3+ and Na+ ions, In-2.24(NCN)(3)
   is a mixed-valence compound, incorporating a monovalent In+ ion besides
   trivalent indium. The NCN(2-)units of bath In-2.24(NCN)(3) and
   NaIn(NCN)(2) reflect perfect D-infinity h point group symmetry within
   the limits of experimental accuracy. Furthermore, an evaluation of all
   presently available crystallographic data on metal cyanamide crystal
   structures manifests that there is no evidence for a non-centrosymmetric
   description of any of these. Likewise, we propose an alternative
   centrosymmetric structural model for lead cyanamide, PbNCN, and question
   the evidence of the unsymmetrical, non-D-infinity h shaped cyanamide
   anion in the latter structure.}},

   Serious cardiac events including myocardial infarction, ischemia, and

   unusually severe but reversible cardiac abnormalities related to IL-2
   therapy: one patient with a profound form of global myocardial
   hypocontractility and a second patient with regional aneurysmal and
   dyskinetic changes of the left ventricle. These cases exhibit unique
   features not previously described in IL-2-treated patients. The possible
   pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying these global and regional forms
   of cardiomyopathy, including the production of secondary-messenger
   molecules such as nitric oxide and myocardial stunning, are discussed.
   Both patients remain disease free of their cancer (>3 years since
   completing therapy), are without residual cardiac dysfunction or
   recurrent related symptoms, and have not experienced any additional
   cardiac events. The report demonstrates the complexity of the cardiac
   toxicities associated with IL-2-based immunotherapy and recognizes a

Abstract = {{During an outbreak of tegumentary leishmaniasis that developed in the
   1990s in the Eastern Andean valley of Huanuco, Peru, the coexistence of
   Andean (uta) and sylvatic leishmaniases was suspected for ecological and
   geographical reasons, and sympatric sampling was carried out. Seven
   human isolates of Leishmania were characterized by multilocus enzyme
   electrophoresis, random amplification of polymorphic DNA and molecular
   karyotyping. The three methods identified 3 isolates as L. braziliensis,
   and 4 isolates as putative hybrids with characters of L. braziliensis
   and L. peruviana. Data from Huanuco are compared to previous results
   from other areas endemic for uta. Biological and epidemiological
   implications are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To determine the bioavailability of oral methotrexate (MTX)
   in patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in the fasting and fed
   states.
   Methods. Each patient randomly received their usual weekly MTX dose
   either orally (po) after an overnight fast, po immediately after a
   breakfast of their choice, or intravenously (iv) on 3 consecutive weeks.
   Blood samples were taken at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, and 6 h after po
   and 0, 0.08, 0.25, 0.5, I, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, and 6 h after iv
   administration.
   Results. Fourteen patients (10 female) aged 2.8 to 15.1 yrs completed
   the study; the results of 13 patients were evaluable. The mean
   elimination rate constant was 0.27 +/- 0.065, 0.26 +/- 0.067, and 0.25
   +/- 0.11 h(-1) after po fasting, po fed, and iv administration,
   respectively. The total area under the serum concentration vs time curve
   was 1.87 +/- 0.83, 1.50 +/- 0.51, and 1.85 +/- 0.80 mu mol/l . h after
   po fasting, po fed, and iv administration, respectively. The maximum
   serum MTX concentration (C-max) was 0.65 +/- 0.33 and 0.39 +/- 0.18 mu
   mol/l after po fasting and po fed administration, respectively (p =
   0.0022). The time to C-max was 0.94 +/- 0.40 and 1.32 +/- 0.68 h after
   po fasting and po fed administration, respectively (p = 0.1464). The
   bioavailability of oral MTX while fasting was 1.1 +/- 0.51, while that
   after a meal was 0.88 +/- 0.35 (p = 0.0211).
   Conclusion. These data indicate greater oral bioavailability of MTX in
   the fasting state. We recommend that children receive MTX on an empty
   stomach.}},

Abstract = {{There are a number of biases that may influence articles in the
   scientific literature in spite of publishing policies and the
   peer-review processes used by most journals. One of these biases is
   caused by the influence of organizations with art economic interest in
   the results of the research. Publication of results influenced in this
   way can be contrary to the goals of public health practice. The purpose
   of this paper is to present an example of an article that was published
   in the AIHA Journal after prior publication in anotherjournal, and in
   which the data may have been manipulated and misrepresented in order to
   benefit the organization conducting the research. Although isocyanates
   were known to cause respiratory sensitization, and cartridge respirators
   were not certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and
   Health for use with isocyanates because of their poor warning
   properties, DuPont and other manufacturers of polyurethane spray paints
   recommended the use of cartridge respirators on their paint labels in
   the 1970s. During the 1970s and early 1980s DuPont carried out several
   experiments at the Haskell Laboratories to demonstrate that organic
   vapor cartridges were effective in removing isocyanates, and that the
   odor of the solvent components of their paints could be used to detect
   cartridge breakthrough. Isocyanates broke through the respirator
   cartridges within 15 minutes of exposure to DuPont's Imron(R) paint in
   some of the earlier studies, but only the results of the final set of
   experiments conducted in 1980 and 1981 were published. The one data
   point that indicated isocyanate breakthrough in these experiments was
   omitted, and the author of the paper stated that ethyl acetate could be
   used as an end-of-life indicator because its odor threshold of 50\%
   recognition is 13 ppm, and it was detected downstream of the respirator
   at a concentration of 6 ppm. Specific recommendations are offered to
   modify the peer-review process to minimize the possibility of scientific
   misconduct.}},

Abstract = {{Plasma membranes (CM) and thylakoid membranes (ICM) were isolated and
   purified from Anacystis nidulans (Synechococcus PCC6301), Synechocystis
   PCC6803 and Anabaena PCC7120 after growth in salt stressed and control
   conditions, harvested from mid-logarithmic (light saturated) and
   linearly growing (light limited) cultures. Immunoblotting of membrane
   proteins with monospecific antibodies raised against authentic
   cytochrome-e oxidases (subunits I and II), cytochromes f and c(1),
   subunit IV of the chloroplast cytochrome b(6)f complex, NDHJ protein (a
   subunit of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase complex), the
   beta-subunit of the (mitochondrial or chloroplast) F-1 coupling factor
   ATPase, and the manganese-stabilizing 33-kD-protein of photosystem II
   gave specific and consistent cross-reactions with both plasma and
   thylakoid membranes but relative intensities of the immune-reactions on
   CM and ICM depended strongly on the growth conditions of the organisms.
   Immunological cross-reactions were in agreement with inhibition profiles
   of the reactions catalysed by the respective proteins. From these two
   lines of evidence it was concluded that, while the cytochrome-c oxidase,
   the cyt b(6)f complex, and the F-type ATPase are present in both CM and
   ICM (relative shares depending on growth conditions), the NDHJ protein
   and cytochrome c(1) (cyt bc(1) complex) are almost exclusively situated
   in the plasma membrane, as is the P-type ATPase, while the 33-kD-protein
   is preferentially located in the thylakoid membranes. Stress conditions
   lead to increased synthesis and incorporation of `'mitochondria-like''
   electron/proton transport proteins into the plasma membrane and to
   elevated concentrations of the soluble electron transport protein
   cytochrome c(6) in the periplasmic space while intrathylakoidal
   concentrations remain unaffected. Results are also discussed with
   respect to the occurrence of immunologically and functionally identical
   electron/proton transport proteins in two different compartments of a
   single (''uncompartmentalized'') prokaryotic cell, viz. a
   cyanobacterium.}},

   which reads like a legal document: the claims often depend on each other
   in a complicated way. While preparing material for a UK, US and Canadian
   patent with my patent attorney, I have found the claims to be the most
   difficult to keep organised: it is only too easy to leave something out,

Abstract = {{Cisplatin resistance, induced in murine fibrosarcoma cells (SSK) in
   vitro or in vivo by low-dose irradiation, can be overcome by activation
   of the cyclic GMP(cGMP)-dependent transduction pathway. This is mediated
   either by stimulating cGMP formation with sodium nitroprusside or by
   replacing cGMP with a selective activator of the cGMP-dependent protein
   kinase, 8-bromo-cGMP. The cyclic AMP-dependent transduction pathway is
   not involved in cisplatin resistance. Instead, activation of cAMP
   sensitises both parental and resistant SSK cells equally to the action
   of cisplatin. There is a 1.8 to 2.5-fold increase in drug toxicity,
   depending on the activating agent. Enhancement of cisplatin sensitivity
   is induced by specific inhibition of cAMP hydrolysis, increase in cAMP
   formation or by increasing the activation potential to cAMP-dependent
   protein kinase by specific cAMP analogues. Cells that have lost
   cisplatin resistance respond to cGMP- or cAMP-elevating agents in the
   same way as the parental SSK cells. The radiation sensitivity is
   unchanged in all cell lines, even after activation of cAMP or cGMP.
   These results suggest that specific DNA repair pathways are altered by
   radiation but affected only in cisplatin damage repair, which is
   regulated by cGMP. Although there is ample cooperativity and interaction
   between the cAMP- and the cGMP-dependent transduction pathways, specific
   substrate binding by cGMP appears to play an important role in
   radiation-induced cisplatin resistance.}},

Abstract = {{We have found previously that microinjections of carbachol into the
   pontine reticular formation (PRF) of rats induce an intense cataleptic
   state which is similar behaviorally with the catalepsy induced by
   systemic administration of neuroleptic drugs. In the experiments
   described in the present article we studied the possibility that the
   pontine carbachol catalepsy is generated via the intermediary of the
   dopaminergic cataleptogenic mechanism in the striatum. To this purpose
   we produced kainic acid lesions in the striatum and in the output
   stations of the striatal cataleptogenic mechanism - substantia nigra
   reticulata and the VM thalamic nucleus. Catalepsy was tested after
   systemic haloperidol (2 mg/kg) and pontine microinjections of carbachol
   (5 mu g/l mu l) before and after the kainic lesions. The cataleptogenic
   effect of carbachol injected in the pens was not attenuated by any of
   the three types of lesions. On the contrary, the cataleptogenic effect
   of haloperidol was greatly attenuated by the same lesions. These results
   suggest that the pontine catalepsy produced by microinjections of
   carbachol in PRF is generated independently of the dopaminergic
   cataleptogenic mechanism in basal ganglia.}},

   Parkinsonian patients had significantly decreased values of csf NE and
   DOPAC, the strong relationship between plasma and csf NE was disrupted
   and neither was there any age related increase of plasma NE. In 1-DOPA
   treated patients plasma DA and DOPA concentrations were raised and csf
   DOPAC values were inversely related to severity of disease (Hoehn and

   patients whereas csf DA concentrations were unchanged. Csf DOPA
   concentrations were insignificantly decreased in parkinsonian patients.

Abstract = {{To determine the regulatory role of prolyl hydroxylation in
   intracellular cardiac procollagen turnover, we examined the effects of
   prolyl 4-hydroxylase inhibitors (alpha,alpha'-dipyridil,
   3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid ethyl ester, pyridine 2,4-dicarboxylic acid
   ethyl ester) and ascorbic acid on procollagen metabolism by cultured,
   neonatal rat cardiac fibroblasts. Ascorbate-deficient fibroblasts showed
   decreased rates of prolyl hydroxylation and total collagen accumulation
   without a significant reduction in alpha(1)(I) and alpha(1)(III) mRNA
   levels. The fraction of newly synthesized procollagens degraded
   intracellularly was also substantially increased in ascorbate-deficient
   cells (50 +/- 7 v 30 +/- 3\% in ascorbate-deficient v control
   fibroblasts; P<0.05). These findings were associated with increased
   intracellular accumulation of Type I procollagen, enhanced secretion of
   `'underhydroxylated'' pro alpha(1)(I) polypeptide into the cell culture
   medium, and decreased extracellular Type I collagen deposition, Similar
   results were obtained:by treating cells with alpha,alpha'-dipyridil (300
   mu M), and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid ethyl ester (400 mu M) in the
   presence of ascorbate. A major portion of the enhanced degradation of
   newly synthesized procollagens occurred within acidic intracellular
   compartments as indicated by the inhibition of procollagen degradation
   by chloroquine (25 mu M). Inhibition of procollagen secretion by
   colchicine (0.5 mu g/ml) enhanced the diversion to, and subsequent
   intracellular degradation of underhydroxylated procollagens in cardiac
   fibroblast lysosomes, We conclude that inactivation of prolyl
   4-hydroxylase increases intracellular accumulation and intralysosomal
   degradation of newly synthesized cardiac procollagen polypeptides. These
   observations suggest that procollagen prolyl hydroxylation may be
   important in the regulation of collagen accumulation by cardiac
   interstitial cells during fibrotic processes in vivo. (C) 1995 Academic

   (BMFT) for DM 400 000, the carefully planned research was conducted by
   university scientists from Munich, and involved nearly 10000 tests,
   using about 500 dowsers. The results of that study have been interpreted
   as demonstrating that a real dowsing phenomenon exists - that certain
   individuals achieved remarkable success rates, apparently based on
   processes that present-day science cannot explain: an interpretation
   that has been widely publicized. A reexamination of the data on which
   that conclusion was based, however, indicates that no persuasive
   evidence was obtained for a genuine, reproducible dowsing skill. The
   absence of reproducibility suggests that the entire research outcome can
   reasonably be attributed to chance.}},

Abstract = {{The Strongin-Hinsie Peck whole-mouth salivation measure (Peck, 1959) is
   typically collected for a 2-min duration. This study compared saliva
   collected for 120 sec with saliva collected for shorter durations (30
   and 60 sec) over repeated presentation of gustatory cues. Results showed
   reliable increases in salivation from a water stimulus baseline to the
   first presentation of lemon juice as a function of measurement duration.
   Repeated measures analysis of variance showed overall decreases in
   salivation across each measurement duration, with a greater rate of
   habituation for the 120-sec interval than for the 30- and 60-sec
   intervals. These data suggest that shorter measurement intervals can be
   used to measure salivation in acute and repeated measurement paradigms,
   but the change in response to repeated stimulus presentations is more
   pronounced for the longer measurement duration.}},

   ipsilateral carotid artery disease requires modification of standard
   distal internal maxillary artery embolization because of the recruitment
   of external carotid to internal carotid and external carotid to
   ophthalmic artery collateral pathways, with subsequent risk of particle
   embolization of these arterial distributions, Proximal internal

Abstract = {{Objective. To ascertain whether carotid intraplaque haemorrhage (IH) in
   patients undergoing carotid artery surgery is a predictor of increased
   cardiac mortality over a 5.5 year follow-up.
   Design and subjects. Carotid artery plaques were obtained at surgery
   from 47 consecutive patients (41 men, six women), median age 67 (range
   48-81) years, with symptoms of carotid transient ischaemic attacks
   (TIAs) or carotid territory minor stroke. As determined at preoperative
   angiography, the degree of stenosis was 50-99\%. Specimens were
   classified histologically as manifesting severe atherosclerosis, fibrous
   plaque, IH, or residual IH debris.
   Setting. Medical Angiology and Vascular Surgery Units, Malmo General
   Hospital.
   Intervention. Carotid endarterectomy.
   Main outcome measure. Correlation between mortality and IH.
   Results. At follow-up after 5.5 years, mortality was 28\% (13/47)
   overall, 92\% (12/13) in the IH subgroup {[}of stroke (n = 1) or
   myocardial infarction (n = 11)], but only 3\% (1/34), of pancreatic
   cancer, in the non-IH subgroup (P = 0.0001). Mortality was also
   significantly higher in the severe atherosclerosis than in the fibrous
   plaque subgroup, 39\% (12/31) vs. 6\% (1/16) (P = 0.044), but not
   significantly increased in any other subgroup (fibrous plaque, residual
   IH, TIA, minor stroke, or acetylsalicylic acid or anticoagulant
   treatment). No correlation existed between IH or death and haemoglobin
   value or platelet count.
   Conclusions. Evidence of recent IH seen at carotid artery surgery may be
   a marker of cardiovascular mortality. As IH was also found in a
   post-mortem control subgroup, the difference may be due to abnormality
   in blood components (e.g., coagulation factors) or impaired vessel-wall
   healing capacity (e.g. endothelial dysfunction).}},

Abstract = {{This study demonstrates that patients who have undergone coronary artery
   bypass graft (CABG) surgery have a high prevalence of abnormal glucose
   tolerance 3 months and 1 year later. Although only 6\% were known to
   have diabetes mellitus (DM) preoperatively, a further 4\% were
   classified DM at two oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) over the
   subsequent year and a further 18\% were classified as having impaired
   glucose tolerance (IGT) at 12 months, Reproducibility of the 120-minute
   plasma glucose level in the 75-g OGTT was estimated from a repeat test
   performed within 10 days. The coefficient of variation (CV) of
   120-minute glucose was between 14\% and 18\%. The observed changes in
   class of glucose tolerance observed at OGTTs repeated 6 and 12 months
   after surgery differed from the predicted changes based purely on the
   estimated variability of 120-minute glucose measurement. There was
   evidence of regression to the mean for the IGT group. However, there was
   also evidence of deteriorating glucose tolerance in some subjects.
   Between 4\% and 9\% of those with IGT 3 months after CABG surgery
   developed DM by 12 months, and 26 (13\%) of those with initially normal
   glucose tolerance (NGT) developed IGT. Insulin and glucose responses in
   the OGTT and estimates of insulin resistance and B-cell function from
   fasting samples show that insulin resistance was the principal
   abnormality in IGT subjects, whereas in DM subjects, both insulin
   resistance and B-cell dysfunction contributed. Analysis of preoperative
   patient characteristics showed that the presence of either a systolic
   blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or body mass index (BMI) of more than 25
   kg/m(2) identified 51\% of the subjects who would at 1 year after
   surgery include all those who would be classified DM and 67\% of those
   who would have IGT. Further analyses including insulin levels identified
   groups at particularly high risk of DM, but no combination of readily
   available preoperative measures identified all those destined to be
   classified IGT. Copyright (C) 1995 by W.B. Saunders Company}},

Abstract = {{A recently synthesized novel colon-specific dexamethasone prodrug,
   dexamethasone-beta-D-glucuronide, delivers efficacious amounts of
   dexamethasone to the colon with limited adrenal suppressive effects.
   During experimentally induced colitis in rats, the dexamethasone prodrug
   is significantly more potent than free dexamethasone in improving
   colonic fluid and electrolyte absorptive injury. The present studies
   examined whether the improvement in colonic absorption seen with the
   prodrug occurred as a consequence of alterations in sodium and chloride
   epithelial transport. The efficacy of the dexamethasone prodrug and free
   dexamethasone were tested in an acetic acid-induced rat model of
   colitis. Healing of the induced colitis was assessed by measuring net
   colonic fluid absorption and surface area ulceration. Transmural
   unidirectional fluxes of Na-22 and Cl-36 across sheets of colonic mucosa
   were measured in Ussing chambers. Treatment of colitis with the prodrug
   delivered a sixfold higher concentration of dexamethasone to the colon
   than did treatment with the free drug. The prodrug accelerated healing
   of colitis by returning in vivo colonic fluid absorption to normal and
   virtually eliminated colonic macroscopic ulceration, whereas the free
   drug did not. In vitro transmural fluxes demonstrated that, in addition
   to repair of mucosal integrity, the prodrug enhanced electroneutral
   sodium chloride absorption over and above that seen in control animals
   or after treatment with the free drug. Both the prodrug and the free
   drug limited theophylline-mediated net chloride and sodium secretion, an
   effect that would be consistent with the antidiarrheal effect induced by
   these drugs in vivo. The results suggest that treatment of
   experimentally induced colitis with the novel colon-specific prodrug,
   dexamethasone-beta-D-glucuronide, has distinct mucosal healing and
   antidiarrheal advantages over administration of its parent, free
   dexamethasone. Specifically, dexamethasone prodrug treatment enhances
   sodium chloride absorptive effects and limits adenosine 3',5'-cyclic
   monophosphate-mediated secretion of colonic epithelia.}},

Abstract = {{Adult thrips flight activity was monitored with water traps in nectarine
   orchards in 4 locations in the mid-Atlantic region in 1992. Thrips
   infestation at bloom and subsequent injury at harvest were evaluated.
   Twenty-nine species of thrips were recovered in water traps. Western
   flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), comprised 92\% of
   the thrips in water trap samples at a site in south central Pennsylvania
   where 16\% of the nectarines were silvered (thrips damage). At another
   site in south central Pennsylvania and at sites in north central
   Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey, flower thrips, F. tritici (Pitch),
   were most numerous and silvering did not occur. The only injurious
   thrips recovered from blossoms was pear thrips, Taeniothrips
   inconsequens (Uzel), at the north central Pennsylvania site where
   increased scarring was observed. Silvering was correlated with the
   number of thrips per fruit and was most extensive in the lower 3rd of
   the canopy in 2 nectarine orchards. In held applications, formetanate
   hydrochloride and methomyl both reduced silvering injury by western
   flower thrips, with the former providing a longer period of protection.
   Cumulative thrips days were highly correlated with the percentage of
   fruit receiving moderate levels of silvering.}},

Abstract = {{Selected optical, mechanical, puncturing, electromechanical instruments
   and accessories for laparoscopic surgery were studied to obtain data
   regarding repair and cleaning modalities. The instruments were used for
   more than 3000 laparoscopies at the City Hospital Moabit, Berlin,
   Germany, from 1990 to 1993. The unique quantity of surgical
   laparoscopies (70-100 per month, 75\% cholecystectomies) and the
   constant use of three trays during 1990/1991 and six trays during
   1992/1993 enabled the statistical documentation of instrument failures
   and the experiences with sterile supply processing. Most repairs
   involved scissors (mainly sharpening), burnt and disconnected
   electromechanical components, defective insulation and lost parts of
   dismounted instruments, For every kind of selected instrument, less than
   five repairs per 100 laparoscopies occurred. Some new instruments
   already showed wear. The related sterile supply processing included the
   rinsing of the lumen of the tube-like instruments to remove detritus
   inside. For this, a new suction device was developed. The effect of
   rinsing was studied by an analysis of ferrum (Fe) by atom absorption
   spectroscopy after rinsing. The remaining contamination on the surface
   of dismounted instruments was documented. Rinsing of < 10 minutes
   duration seemed to be effective. On compound instruments, like the
   bipolar forceps with insulated shaft ends, remaining proteins could be
   detected. They were identified by chromatography as parts of human
   blood. Further investigation has to be done on this issue. For sterile
   supply processing staff, the endoscopic instruments mean extra work in
   the form of disassembling, maintenance, reassembling and testing.
   Skilled operatives are needed. Precleaning procedures should include
   rinsing the lumen of shaft instruments, therefore construction should
   avoid right angles inside the tube. Disinfection with aldehydes before
   cleaning the lumina must be avoided because of the protein coagulation
   that will occur. Trocars must still be cleaned by hand. Dismounting of
   reusable instruments for sterilization is only useful when simple. A
   tube-in-tube concept should be established for the design of tube-like
   shaft instruments.}},

Abstract = {{Persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for >8 years

   long-term survival. Whereas those with 300-700 CD4(+) cells/mu L often
   had circulating cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) against HIV antigens,
   those with >1000 CD4(+) cells/mu L did not. The subjects with >1000
   CD4(+) cells/mu L had low virus burden, low levels of Gag-specific CTL
   precursors, and minimal CD8(+) cell activation. Overall, elevated levels
   of CD8(+) cells, CD38 antigen expression on CD8(+) cells, and anti-HIV
   functions were correlated with increased virus burden, provirus load,
   and HIV plasma RNA levels. A factor that suppressed HIV replication was
   spontaneously secreted from CD8(+) cells of most subjects but not from
   those with high CD4(+) cell counts. CD8(+) cell activities, therefore,
   may reflect chronic viral stimulation of the immune system. Long-term

   In this process, suspended starch is settled down and left aside for a
   few weeks under anaerobic conditions where natural lactic populations
   develop.
   Three collections of clones isolated from local fermentations have been
   identified using the API procedure and further characterized. Most of
   them belong to different species of Lactobacillus. Many display a ropy
   phenotype, typical for exopolysaccharide (EPS) excretion. A possible

Abstract = {{Homograft cell viability after cryopreservation was investigated and
   cytoimmunologic monitoring was performed during the early postoperative
   course to research possible immunologic reactions after allograft aortic
   valve replacement. After cryopreservation, morphologic observations were
   made, a nonradioactive cell proliferation assay was used, and
   prostaglandin I-2 secretion of the remaining endothelial cells was
   determined. Cytoimmunologic monitoring was performed daily within the
   first 3 weeks postoperatively. An increase of the activation index
   greater than 1 was rated as an immunologic reaction. Maintained
   metabolic activity of graft endothelial cells after cryopreservation was
   Confirmed by prostaglandin I-2 release (9.24 +/- 3.48 ng/cm(2) basic
   release and 20.1 +/- 5.76 ng/cm(2) when stimulated with 25 mu mol/L Na
   arachidonic acid). Cell proliferation was indicated after graft
   incubation with the nonradioactive viability kit (0.27 +/- 0.9 at 450
   nm). Cytoimmunologic examinations (n = 861) after homograft implantation
   showed a more intense activation in patients with ABO-incompatible
   grafts (activation index 2.1 +/- 1.6, n = 16) than in those with
   ABO-compatible grafts (activation index 1.3 +/- 0.8, n = 17). In these
   groups, the duration of activation by cytoimmunologic monitoring was 2.8
   +/- 1.5 days and 1.3 +/- 0.6 days, respectively (p < 0.041). No
   activation was observed in 8 patients after xenograft valve replacement
   (p < 0.01). Our data indicate that cryopreservation of homograft valves
   represents a cell- and tissue-protective preservation method.
   Postoperatively, all homograft valves caused immunologic reactions,
   which were reversible without immunosuppression treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Avocado surface wax and the ripening hormone ethylene induce conidial
   germination and appressorium formation in the avocado pathogen,
   Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. Both the host surface wax and ethylene
   induced phosphorylation of mainly 29 kDa and 43 kDa proteins and
   enhanced phosphorylation of proteins at 18 kDa. Protein kinase
   inhibitors H-7 and genistein inhibited ethylene-induced appressorium
   formation and phosphorylation of the proteins. However, wax-induced
   appressorium formation and protein phosphorylation were hardly affected
   by H-7. In yeast extract that allows spore germination, calyculin A, a
   potent inhibitor of protein phosphatases, induced appressorium formation
   and phosphorylation of the same 29 and 43 kDa proteins as did ethylene
   and avocado wax. Calyculin A also caused abnormal differentiation such
   as the formation of an additional appressorium directly from the initial
   appressorium and at higher concentrations the formation of unusual
   structures. These results indicate that protein phosphorylation may be
   involved in the induction of appressorium formation by the two host
   signals. (C) 1995 Academic Press Limited}},

Abstract = {{Background: As in the brain, recent evidence has suggested a defect in
   the microcirculation during the reperfusion period after spinal cord
   ischemia. This investigation was undertaken in order to delineate blood
   flow dynamics in the postischemic spinal cord of the rat. Methods: Male
   Sprague-Dawley rats underwent cross-clamping of the aorta and subclavian
   arteries (XC) for 11 minutes. Spinal cord blood flow (SCBF) was measured
   by autoradiography in the gray and white matter of cervical (Ce),
   thoracic (Th) and lumbar (Lu) regions during XC, 1 h, 6 h and 24 h (XC n
   = 8, 1 h n = 9, 6 h n = 9, and 24 h n = 11, groups) after XC. Control
   groups underwent surgical manipulations and SCBF measurement but no XC
   (Sham 1, n = 8), or clamping of the subclavian arteries only (Sham 2, n
   = 8). Results: In Ce cord, there was no difference between SCBF of 1 h,
   6 h, 24 h and Sham 1. In Th cord, SCBF was reduced during XC (P < 0.003
   vs. Sham 2), 1 h, 6 h (P < 0.04 and P < 0.01 vs. Sham 1). In Lu cord,
   SCBF was not detectable in XC, and depressed in 1 h (P < 0.003) and 6 h
   (P < 0.003). There was no difference between 24 h and Sham 1 in Ce, Th,
   and Lu cords. Conclusions: The study demonstrated a period of delayed
   postischemic hypoperfusion in the white and gray matter of Th and Lu
   cord segments lasting 6 h after XC. The phenomenon may play an important
   role in the ultimate fate of neural elements with borderline viability
   after ischemic injury.}},

   Materials and Methods: The study included 45 patients with localized

   (8) PSA level after gonadal androgen withdrawal.
   Results: Of 40 evaluable patients with localized cancer and 50 with
   metastatic cancer 32 (80\%) and 27 (54\%), respectively, had a PSA
   decrease of 50\% or more of baseline during flutamide treatment (p =
   0.014). Among patients with localized cancer actuarial analysis of
   freedom from PSA elevation during flutamide treatment favored those with
   a 50\% or greater PSA decrease (p = 0.006) but in patients with
   metastatic cancer the analysis revealed no significant difference.
   Conclusions: The relative density of tumor cells that are dependent on
   adrenal androgen after gonadal androgen withdrawal may be greater in
   patients with localized cancer and deferred flutamide treatment may
   enhance cancer control in those with localized disease.}},

Abstract = {{Five mAb directed at the IL-2R beta chain were analyzed for their
   binding and functional properties. They define three epitopes on a
   recombinant soluble beta chain or on the beta chain expressed at the
   surface of YT-2C2 cells. Epitope 1 (A41 and 6E8 mAb) is part of the IL-2
   binding domain, whereas epitope 2 (CF1 and 6E10 mAb) is not involved in
   IL-2 binding. Epitope 3 (6B5 mAb) also partly overlaps the IL-2 binding
   domain but does not overlap epitopes 1 and 2. None of the mAb can by
   themselves inhibit IL-2 induced proliferation of a human activated T
   cell clone. Only epitope 1 mAb can synergize with an anti-alpha chain
   mAb to inhibit this proliferation. Using epitope 1 and 2 mAb as well as
   a purified, recombinant form of the IL-2R beta chain extracellular
   domain, an ELISA-based immunoassay was set up which allows the
   quantitative determination of soluble and detergent solubilized IL-2R
   beta chains. Epitopes 1 and 2 are in non-competitive interaction: the
   binding of a mAb to one epitope decreases the affinity of a mAb for the
   second epitope. Epitope 2 mAb have binding stoichiometries (-16,000
   sites/cell) which are -80\% higher than that of epitope 1 mAb and IL-2
   itself (-9000 sites/cell), Upon binding of epitope 2 mAb, the
   stoichiometries of epitope 1 mAb and IL-2 are increased to reach the
   stoichiometry of epitope 2 mAb, A molecular model is proposed in which
   the IL-2R beta chain exists in two different states on YT-2C2 cells: one
   associated with the intermediate-affinity IL-2R ply complex, the other
   being part of a receptor structure which is not accessible to epitope 1
   mAb and IL-2.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Assisted reproduction implies increased risks of
   pathological pregnancy, necessitating close follow up of early
   pregnancy. The use of serum hCG levels two and three weeks after embryo
   transfer for prediction of pregnancy outcome after in vitro
   fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF/ET) or gamete intrafallopian transfer
   (GIFT) was evaluated.
   Methods. Three hundred and twenty-nine treatment cycles were included.
   Serum samples were obtained on days 14 and 21 after ET and hCG was
   determined by fluoroimmunoassay. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
   curves were analyzed to find cut-off levels of hCG giving maximal
   sensitivity and specificity, identifying a low risk group and a high
   risk group with regard to pathological pregnancy.
   Results. The group of patients carrying a viable pregnancy had
   significantly higher hCG levels two and three weeks after ET than the
   group of patients carrying a pathological pregnancy. Furthermore, the
   daily increase in hCG was higher. In multiple gestations, the levels of
   hCG were significantly higher compared to singleton pregnancies. Ninety
   per cent of the patients with an hCG level greater than or equal to 150
   IU/L 13-15 days after ET carried a pregnancy to term (the low risk
   group), Conversely, 50\% of the patients with hCG <150 IU/L carried a
   pathological pregnancy (the high risk group).
   Conclusion. A single determination of the hCG level two weeks after ET,
   combined with transvaginal ultrasound two to three weeks later, is a
   reliable follow-up. In cases of subnormal hCG levels (<150 IU/L), a
   second hCG determination one week later followed by sonography is
   recommended.}},

Abstract = {{The present study was aimed to test the role of endothelin-1 (ET-1) as a
   possible autocrine/paracrine growth factor for cardiac fibroblasts, and
   to examine its interaction with cardiac natriuretic hormones, Expression
   of preproET-1 (ppET-1) mRNA by cultured cardiac fibroblasts from
   neonatal rats was demonstrated by Northern blot analysis using cDNA for
   rat ppET-1 as a probe, Angiotensin II (ANG II) and ET-1 transiently (30
   min) increased steady-state ppET-1 mRNA levels in cardiac fibroblasts,
   Both ET-1 and ANG II significantly stimulated {[}H-3]thymidine
   incorporation into cardiac fibroblasts, whose effects were
   dose-dependently inhibited by an ETA receptor antagonist (BQ123), BQ123
   also inhibited both ET-1- and ANG II-induced ppET-1 mRNA expression,
   Both atrial and brain natriuretic peptides (ANP, BNP), which activate
   particulate guanylate cyclase, inhibited ppET-1 mRNA expression and
   {[}H-3]thymidine incorporation stimulated by ANG II and ET-1, Sodium
   nitroprusside, a soluble guanylate cyclase activator, and 8-bromo-cyclic
   GMP, a membrane-permeable cGMP derivative, similarly inhibited ppET-1
   mRNA expression and {[}H-3]thymidine incorporation, BNP was more potent
   than ANP to inhibit ANG II- and ET-1-stimulated DNA synthesis, whereas
   BNP and ANP were almost equipotent in stimulating cGMP generation in
   cardiac fibroblasts, Our data demonstrated that ANG II and ET-1
   upregulate ET-1 gene expression in rat cardiac fibroblasts partly via
   cyclic GMP-dependent mechanism, and that natriuretic peptides inhibit
   ANG II-stimulated proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts, possibly by
   inhibiting ET-1 gene expression, Our data suggest the possible role of
   endogenous ET-1 as an autocrine/paracrine growth factor for cardiac
   fibroblasts and its close interaction with natriuretic peptides in the
   regulation of cardiac fibrosis.}},

Abstract = {{The globular cluster NGC 6352, which on the basis of its Galactic
   position, radial velocity, and {[}Fe/H] is a member of the (thick) disk
   system of globular clusters, has been observed to below the
   main-sequence turnoff (MSTO) using the Hubble Space Telescope. These
   observations, which were obtained before the repair mission, were
   analyzed using the flux-conserving iterative/recursive deconvolution
   algorithm developed at the University of North Carolina. This algorithm
   can produce more precise photometry than standard PSF-fitting methods
   with the aberrated images. The V, (V-I-C) color-magnitude diagram
   constructed from these observations places the cluster turnoff at
   V=18.80+/-0.10. Observations with the CTIO 0.9 m telescope have been
   used to photometer the brighter stars in the cluster, providing a
   calibration of the HST data and an estimate of the cluster's reddening,
   E(B - V)=0.21+/-0.03. From. spectroscopic observations of the strengths
   of the Ca n triplet lines in red giants in the cluster and from previous
   measurements in the literature, we find that NGC 6352 is only slightly
   more metal rich (Delta{[}Fe/H]=0.08+/-0.05) than the prototypical disk
   globular cluster, 47 Tuc. From the difference in V magnitude between the
   horizontal branch and the MSTO, we find that NGC 6352 is essentially the
   same age as 47 Tuc (formally, older by 0.7+/-2.2 Gyr). Comparisons with
   the latest Yale isochrones support this result and yield 14.5+/-2 Gyr
   for the age of 47 Tuc from the photometry of Hesser et al. {[}PASP, 99,
   739 (1987)], which is consistent with other determinations. The old age
   obtained for NGC 6352 provides additional evidence that the disk system
   of globular clusters is very old and is in fact older or comparable in
   age to several globular clusters populating the Galactic halo. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{A total of 333 pediatric renal transplantations performed at our
   institution between January 1977 and July 1994 was retrospectively
   reviewed to provide guidelines for minimizing the incidence of
   transplant renal artery stenosis. The patients who had renal artery
   stenosis were 3 months to 17.5 years old (median age 9.3 years) at the
   time of transplantation and the condition was diagnosed 2.2 months to
   2.5 years (median 4.2 months) after transplantation. Renal artery
   stenosis was diagnosed in 19 transplants (19 of 333, 5.7\%) as a result
   of severe hypertension or renal function deterioration. Stenosis
   occurred at the anastomosis in 7 cases (37\%) and distal to the
   anastomosis in 12 (63\%). Transplantations performed with. a donor
   aortic cuff resulted in a lower rate of renal artery stenosis at the
   anastomosis (0 of 193, 0\%) compared to those performed without a cuff
   (7 of 140, 5.0\%, p = 0.0021). The rate of renal artery stenosis distal
   to the anastomosis was not different regardless of whether a cuff was
   used (5 of 193 cases, 2.6\%) or not (7 of 140, 5.0\%, p = 0.37).
   End-to-end anastomoses to internal iliac arteries, which were always
   performed without cuffs, had a particularly high rate of renal artery
   stenosis (3 of 10, 30\%) compared to end-to-side anastomoses performed
   without cuffs (4 of 130, 3.1\%, p = 0.0080). Bench surgery or multiple
   renal arteries did not adversely influence the rate of renal artery
   stenosis. With prompt diagnosis and treatment the actuarial graft
   survival of the transplants with renal artery stenosis was similar to
   that of the transplants without :renal artery stenosis (p >0.05).}},

   the coal used for burning, the fly ash obtained after the electrostatic
   precipitator and the ambient particulates collected at the five sampling

   necessitates the use of factor analysis to identify the source prior to
   regression analysis for apportionment of the contribution of the various
   factors identified. Six factors are successfully isolated and their
   sources identified. Despite a negative loading of the sea aerosol, the
   mass contributions of other major sources (mgm(-3)) are estimated as

Abstract = {{A general framework for future development of intelligent operator
   support systems in nuclear plants is proposed in this paper. The central
   idea in the framework is the decision-making through consensus among
   multiple agents, each conducting diagnosis on the basis of mutually
   different, i.e, diverse, principle by focusing dissimilar symptoms
   obtained from the plant. The applicability and credibility of the
   operator support system are expected to be significantly improved by
   implementing the proposed scheme. The effectiveness of diversification
   in symptom description independently of the effect of reasoning methods
   was mainly evaluated in this paper. A prototype system was developed for
   the subtask of fault diagnosis by multiple neural networks emulating the
   diagnostic agents. The advantage of the proposed framework, together
   with the related technique of symptom diversification and consensus, was
   clearly demonstrated through numerical evaluations simulating anomalies
   in a pressurized water reactor. The obtained results validate, at least
   to same extent, the present claim of combining multiple and diverse
   perspectives for reliable decision-making in high-hazard artifacts.}},

Abstract = {{The release of radiolytic CO gas from Co-60 gamma-irradiated pepper
   seeds was unexpectedly slower than that of radiolytic Hz gas during a
   storage period after irradiation. These gases were retained in the
   grains and could be recovered by pulverization under gastight condition.
   Using this procedure, 10-kGy-irradiated pepper grains could be
   distinguished from nonirradiated samples for more than 2 months by the
   level of CO and H-2 gases. The patterns of CO change at 10, 20, and 30
   kGy were similar, and the CO amounts were proportional to irradiation
   doses at any point of the storage period after irradiation. Co-60
   gamma-irradiated grains of allspice, cinnamon, cumin, polished rice, and
   wheat could be distinguished from nonirradiated ones by the level of

Abstract = {{First-year students in college who had participated in a study of
   college-decision-making 8 to 20 months earlier were asked to recall the
   criteria they had used and the alternatives they had considered in
   making the decision. They were also asked to describe the criteria they
   thought, in retrospect, that they ought to have used, and to rate their
   satisfaction with the decision-making process and its outcome. Two
   hundred and seven of the original 322 participants responded to a
   follow-up questionnaire through the mail. Participants recalled about
   half of the criteria they originally reported using, and about
   two-thirds of the schools they originally reported considering. Their
   recall of criteria was affected by their current view of the criteria
   they should have used, providing a replication for previous findings. No
   gender or academic ability effects were found. Somewhat surprisingly,
   given existing literature, recall was unaffected by emotional responses
   to the decision, either those reported during the decision-making
   process or those reported retrospectively. Overall, the pattern of
   results suggests that memory is affected by a decision-maker's current
   cognitive framework of the decision, specifically, their retrospective
   view of how they ought to have made the decision. Moreover, memory is
   far from perfect, even for stimuli that the decision-maker generated
   her- or himself, and to which presumably, they gave significant amounts
   of thought.}},

Abstract = {{Although Mycobacterium avium is usually nonpathogen ic in healthy
   individuals, in vitro infection of macrophages (M phi) from the majority
   of healthy donors induces death of the cells 2 wk after infection; this
   effect is in contrast to noninfected M phi, which survive for months in
   culture. We demonstrate here that treatment of normal M phi with
   indomethacin further shortens the life of these cells to 48 h after
   infection with M. avium. Indomethacin treatment of the M phi also
   prevents M. avium-dependent accumulation of mRNA-encoding plasminogen
   activator inhibitor type-2 (PAI-2), an inhibitor of urokinase-type
   plasminogen activator. Occurrence of nuclear condensation and DNA
   fragmentation in M phi pretreated with indomethacin and infected with M.
   avium indicates that the early death of these cells is caused by
   apoptosis. In contrast, priming of M phi with CM-CSF significantly
   prolongs their survival after M. avium infection and enhances M.
   avium-induced accumulation of PAI-2 mRNA. Most importantly, addition of
   PAI-2 is sufficient to prevent apoptosis of M phi infected with M. avium
   in the presence of indomethacin. Finally, M phi not treated with
   indomethacin also die of apoptosis 7 to 10 days after M. avium infection
   and can be rescued by PAI-2. These studies indicate that production of
   PAI-2 by normal M phi as a consequence of M. avium infection inhibits
   programmed cell death, a mechanism that might serve to prevent the
   spread of the infection.}},

   Moments to determine (\$) over right arrow M(s), for a small, square
   aperture loaded with a number of impedance sheets of practical interest.
   These values of (\$) over right arrow M(s) have been used to calculate

Abstract = {{The proportion of living sperm in semen from six representative mammals
   was assessed by means of a dual staining technique using the stains
   SYBR-14 and propidium iodide (PI). SYBR-14, a newly developed
   fluorescent nucleic acid stain, maximally absorbs at 488 nm and emits at
   518 nm when bound to DNA, Microscopic examination revealed that SYBR-14
   stained the nuclei of living sperm bright green as determined by
   simultaneous examination of fluorescence and motility. Conversely, PI
   stained only nonmotile sperm that had lost their membrane integrity.
   Sperm from bulls, boars, rams, rabbits, mice, and men were stained and
   examined through use of fluorescence microscopy. The proportions of
   living and dead sperm were determined by first staining with SYBR-14 and
   PI and then assessing stain uptake by flow cytometry, Similar staining
   patterns were observed in all six mammalian species tested. Three
   populations of sperm were identified: living-SYBR-14 stained, dead-PI
   stained, and moribund-doubly stained. The SYBR-14 staining was replaced
   by PI staining as sperm progressed from living to moribund. The
   transition from green (SYBR-14) to red (PI) fluorescence started at the
   posterior region of the sperm head and proceeded anteriorly, The
   proportions of living and dead sperm in mammalian semen were readily
   identified through use of dual staining with SYBR-14 and PI and

Abstract = {{General transcription factor SIII, a heterotrimer composed of 110-kDa
   (p110), 18-kDa (p18), and 15-kDa (p15) subunits, increases the catalytic
   rate of transcribing RNA polymerase II by suppressing transient pausing
   by polymerase at multiple sites on DNA templates. Here we report
   molecular cloning and biochemical characterization of the SIII p18
   subunit, which is found to be a member of the ubiquitin homology (UbH)
   gene family and functions as a positive regulatory subunit of SIII. p18
   is a 118-amino acid protein composed of an 84-residue N-terminal UbH
   domain fused to a 34-residue C-terminal tail. Mechanistic studies
   indicate that p18 activates SIII transcriptional activity above a basal
   Level inherent in the SIII p110 and p15 subunits. Taken together, these
   findings establish a role for p18 in regulating the activity of the RNA
   polymerase II elongation complex, and they bring to light a function for
   a UbH domain protein in transcriptional regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale and Objectives. We evaluated the efficacy of a particulate
   computed tomography (CT) contrast agent in an animal model of focal
   liver disease.
   Methods. Ethyl ester of diatrizoic acid (EEDA) is an iodinated (89 mg I/
   ml) nanoparticulate (200 nm) contrast agent intended for intravenous use
   that is currently undergoing preclinical testing in our laboratory.
   Focal liver abscesses were created in 11 New Zealand White rabbits.
   Iohexol and EEDA were administered to each animal on different days. CT
   scanning was performed at intervals following contrast agent
   administration, Liver and abscess enhancement were measured and
   compared. Dynamic imaging experiments in normal animals were also
   performed using both agents.
   Results. EEDA resulted in significantly greater enhancement of the liver
   and liver-to-abscess contrast than did iohexol at all time points beyond
   5 min at approximately 25\% of the total iodine load. During dynamic
   imaging, liver and aortic enhancement were greater with EEDA than with
   iohexol, except during a 20- to 40-sec period immediately following
   contrast agent administration.
   Conclusion. EEDA is superior to iohexol for imaging liver abscesses. Our
   results suggest that liver-directed agents such as EEDA may prove to be
   more efficacious than currently available extracellular agents designed
   for Liver CT scanning.}},

Abstract = {{Aqueous dispersions of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC), calf lung
   surfactant (LS) and an organic solvent extract of calf surfactant (CLSE)
   were examined by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy in the
   presence and absence of calcium. DPPC, the single most abundant
   constituent of lung surfactant, had FTIR spectra that were essentially
   equivalent in 0.15 M NaCl with or without calcium (5 mM CaCl2 or 5 mM
   EDTA at pH similar to 5.6). DPPC dispersions had spectral
   characteristics very similar to solid DPPC, with differences reflecting
   largely phosphate group hydrogen bonding in the aqueous phase. In
   contrast, dispersions of CLSE and whole LS had spectral behavior that
   was calcium-dependent. In the absence of calcium, acyl wagging bands
   (similar to 1170-1300 cm(-1)) were significantly decreased in intensity
   for CLSE compared to DPPC, indicating that the hydrophobic surfactant
   proteins and secondary surfactant lipids led to fewer phospholipid
   chains in the trans configuration. Wagging bands were also decreased in
   LS without calcium compared to DPPC. Phospholipid order was increased in
   dispersions of both CLSE and LS in 5 mM CaCl2 compared to 5 mM EDTA.
   Acyl wagging bands became more prominent for both CLSE and whole LS with
   calcium, although they were still less intense than for DPPC alone. Acyl
   stretching bands in the region 2800-3000 cm(-1) were broadened and
   lowered in frequency for CLSE in 5 mM CaCl2 compared to 5 mM EDTA, also
   consistent with increased chain order. Additional calcium-dependent SP-A
   mediated ordering was indicated by even broader symmetrical and
   asymmetrical acyl stretching bands for whole LS in 5 mM CaCl2.
   Broadening of phosphate asymmetrical and symmetrical stretching
   bands(similar to 1220 and 1080/1065 cm(-1), respectively) for CLSE and
   LS dispersions in 5 mM CaCl2 suggested that calcium also interacted with
   at least a subset of surfactant phospholipids in the headgroup region,
   The observed effects on molecular order from the surfactant apoproteins
   and secondary lipids in LS and CLSE dispersions may be related to their
   actions in facilitating the adsorption of DPPC to the air-water

Abstract = {{High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans were obtained at 1 cm
   intervals in 63 subjects referred for surgical resection of a cancer or
   for transplantation to find out whether the relative area of lung
   occupied by attenuation values lower than a threshold would be a
   measurement of macroscopic emphysema. Using a semiautomatic procedure,
   the relative areas occupied by attenuation values lower than eight
   thresholds ranging from -900 to -970 HU were calculated on the set of
   scans obtained through the lobe or the lung to be resected. The extent
   of emphysema was quantified by a computer-assisted method on horizontal
   paper-mounted lung sections obtained every 1 to 2 cm. The only level for
   which no statistically significant difference was found between the HRCT
   and the morphometric data was -950 HU. To determine the number of scans
   sufficient for an accurate quantification, we recalculated the relative
   area occupied by attenuation values lower than -950 HU on progressively
   fewer numbers of scans and investigated the departure from the results
   obtained with 1 cm intervals. Because of wide variations in this
   departure from patient to patient, a standard cannot be recommended as
   the optimal distance between scans.}},

Abstract = {{Ropivacaine is a new local anaesthetic agent. Previous animal studies
   have indicated that vasoconstrictor effects are elicited by ropivacaine
   in vitro and subcutaneously and that it produces blanching of the skin
   if injected subcutaneously in humans.
   Lidocaine is a widely used local anaesthetic reported to exert a
   biphasic effect on the microvasculature with contraction at low
   concentrations and relaxation at high concentrations. There is a need
   for pharmacologic tools able to counteract local arterial
   vasoconstriction. In this study, the contractile effect of ropir;acaine
   and lidocaine were investigated in vitro on isolated human arteries.
   Experiments were performed on 43 internal mammary artery (IMA) rings
   obtained from 22 patients and on 14 radial artery (RA) rings from 7
   patients. The rings were mounted in organ baths and isometric
   contractile activity was measured. Experiments were conducted by
   cumulative adding ropivacaine or lidocaine (1.5x10(-5) M; 4.5x10(-5) M;
   1.5x10(-4) M; 4.5x10(-4) M; 1.5x10(-3) M; 4.5x10(-3) M; 1.5x10(-2) M) to
   the organ baths. The endothelium was mechanically removed in 19 IMA
   rings and in 9 RA rings.
   Ropivacaine and lidocaine produced a biphasic response with contraction
   at low concentrations (1.5x10(-5)-1.5x10(-3) M) and release of the
   maximal contraction at higher concentrations. No statistically
   significant differences in contractile or relaxing effects were seen
   between the two drugs. Removal of the endothelium did not significantly
   affect contractile activity.
   In this study of human mammary artery preparations, ropivacaine is not a
   stronger vasoconstrictor than lidocaine.}},

Abstract = {{5-HT-induced acute gastric mucosal injury was assessed in rats by using
   5HT(1), 5HT(2), 5HT(3), 5HT(4) or muscarinic receptor related drugs.
   Rats were treated with antagonists i.p. and 30 minutes later either
   vehicle, 5-HT (20 mg/kg) or other agonists were administered s.c. The
   stomachs were removed 4 hours after the last injection and mucosal
   integrity was assessed by light microscopy using a histological ulcer
   index (HUI). The HUI was found to be significantly increased following
   5-HT administration (1.57 +/- 0.3) when compared with controls (0.14 +/-
   0.1). 5HT(1) agonist 5-carboxamidotryptamine (20 mg/kg) produced acute
   gastric erosion and increased the HUI (P < 0.05). The HUI in the animals
   receiving 5-HT1D agonist sumatriptan (7 mg/kg) was found to be 1.62 +/-
   0.24. 5HT(2) antagonist ketanserine (2.5-15 mg/kg), 5HT(3) antagonist
   ondansetron (1-5 mg/kg), 5HT(4) antagonist DAU 6285 (1-10 mg/kg) and
   atropine (1.5-30 mg/kg) exerted no effect whereas 5HT(1/2) antagonist
   metitepine (0.05-0.5 mg/kg) caused a dose dependent inhibition of the
   effect of 5-HT. The results from this study demonstrate that 5-HT causes
   acute gastric mucosal injury and this injury is probably due to the
   activation of the 5-HT1D receptors.}},

Abstract = {{Mice homozygous for Ipr or gld develop lymphoproliferative disease
   characterized by the progressive accumulation of functionally impaired
   B220(+) double-negative (DN)T cells and primed CD4(+) and CD8(+) T
   cells. The mechanisms leading to the accumulation of these T cell
   subsets are poorly understood but are clearly dependent on lack of
   expression of Fas in Ipr mice and expression of defective Fast in gld
   mice. A role for V(beta)8(+) T cells also has been reported. Recently, a
   variety of experimental approaches revealed that the majority of B220(+)
   DN T cells are derived from MHC class I-selected CD8(+) precursors. Here
   we used the potent mitogen, staphylococcal enterotoxin 8 (SEB): (i) to
   examine the effects of defective Fas-FasL expression on the deletion of
   peripheral V(beta)8(+) T cells in 6- to 8- and 20-week old C3H-Ipr and
   -gld mice, (ii) to determine the immunocompetence of B220(+) DN T cells
   in vivo, and (iii) to determine if activated V(beta)8(+) CD8(+) T cells
   can differentiate into B220(+) DN T cells. The role of V(beta)8(+) T
   cells in the accumulation of B220(+) DN T cells also was reinvestigated.
   These studies showed that deletion pathways independent of Fas-FasL
   expression function in young Ipr and gld mice and delete CD4(+) T cells
   more efficiently than CD8(+) T cells. As the mice age, these alternative
   pathways become less effective and this may explain the progressive
   accumulation of memory T cells. No abnormalities in tolerance induction
   were observed in young or diseased mice. Stimulation of +/+, Ipr and gld
   V(beta)8(+) CD8(+) T cells induced the expression of B220, B220 levels
   were maximal 2 days after SEE and were undetectable 5 days later,
   suggesting that B220 is a transiently expressed activation marker on
   CD8(+) T cells. Neither the B220(+) V(beta)8(+) CD8(+) T cells nor other
   V(beta)8(+) T cell populations converted with detectable frequency into
   B220(+) DN T cells after single or multiple doses of SEB. B220(+) DN T
   cells, which are functionally anergic in vitro, did not proliferate or
   undergo deletion after SEB stimulation indicating that these cells also
   are functionally impaired in vivo. In contrast to previous reports,
   chronic elimination of V(beta)8(+) T cells had no effect on the
   accumulation of B220(+) DN T cells. These data suggest, first, that the
   accumulation of B220(+) DN T cells is unlikely to occur solely by
   antigen-induced proliferation of B220(+) DN T cells but also may be
   dependent on the continuous conversion of putative CD8(+) MHC class I
   selected precursors into B220(+) DN T cells. Second, strongly activated
   CD8(+) T cells that avoid deletion in the periphery are an unlikely
   source of B220(+) DN T cells.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: We document the incidence of complications associated with
   laparoscopic nephrectomy in a multi-institutional study.
   Materials and Methods: The study included the initial 185 patients
   undergoing laparoscopic nephrectomy at 5 centers in the United States
   between June 1990 and July 1993.
   Results: A total of 30 patients (16\%) had 34 complications. There was
   no mortality. Access-related complications included 2 cases of hernia
   formation at the trocar site, 1 abdominal wall hematoma and 1 trocar
   injury to a hydronephrotic kidney. Intraoperative complications included
   5 cases of vascular injury, 1 splenic laceration and 1 pneumothorax.
   Postoperative complications involved the gastrointestinal tract in 6
   cases, cardiovascular system in 6, genitourinary tract in 4, respiratory
   system in 4 and musculoskeletal system in 2. Miscellaneous complications
   occurred in 3 patients. Open surgical intervention was required
   electively in 8 patients and on an emergency basis in 2. The incidence
   of complications decreased with experience: 71\% occurred during the
   initial 20 cases at each institution.
   Conclusions: In our early experience the complication rate for
   laparoscopic nephrectomy was 12\% in patients with benign renal disease
   and 34\% in those with renal cancer. Based on this collective
   experience, recommendations for prevention, recognition and treatment of
   complications are made.}},

Abstract = {{The headwater section of the Thomson River has been nominated for
   listing as a heritage river, mainly because it supports a population of
   large blackfish, a species which has high conservation value in
   Victoria. The upper river was dammed in 1983, creating an impoundment of
   1.2 x 10(6) Ml capacity. It is anticipated that the dam will provide a
   reliable water supply to Melbourne for up to 20 years, but minimization
   of downstream releases will delay augmentation. For the period during
   which the dam was filling, an interim environmental flow was applied.
   However, these flows were lower than what was considered at the time to
   be ideal for maintaining in-stream habitat in the long term. Despite
   profound modification of the river's hydrology, there is no evidence for
   serious environmental impacts. Macroinvertebrate populations have
   recovered from disturbance during the construction phase, and the
   diversity of fish has not changed. However, there is concern that a lack
   of floods will result in contraction of the channel. This would probably
   mean a loss of available habitat area in the long term. Abstraction of
   water from the lowland section of the Thomson River began in 1957.
   Unfavourably low flows have occurred since regulation, but wetland
   inundation floods still occur with the same frequency. Although current
   management practices do allow unfavourable flow conditions to occur
   occasionally, the regulated flow regime has not reduced the diversity of
   native fish present in the lower river. This is heartening, but given
   the likelihood of future increases in the demand for water, long-term
   protection of in-stream fauna requires the application of an appropriate
   environmental flow regime. Habitat area-discharge curves derived from
   fish hydraulic preference data were used as the basis for devising a
   minimum flow recommendation. Five different methods of specifying
   monthly flow regimes are compared. A method is presented that uses
   hydraulic geometry relations from a neighbouring, hydrologically similar
   catchment to specify the magnitude and duration of an artificial annual
   channel maintenance flood. Implementation of the suggested environmental
   flow regime will probably result in a flow deficit in the lower Thomson
   River if current irrigation demands are to be met. To offset the
   deficit, additional water can be released from the dam. The flow
   required will not reduce the amount of habitat available in the upper
   Thomson River below the dam, but this strategy will bring forward the
   date of augmentation.}},

Abstract = {{Theophylline-induced seizures have significant morbidity and mortality
   and are difficult to treat. Theophylline therapy for asthma has been
   observed to depress plasma pyriodoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) levels which
   may decrease gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synthesis and thereby
   contribute to seizures. We hypothesized that treatment with pyridoxine
   might prove beneficial in theophylline-induced seizures. One hundred
   thirty-nine mice were injected with 250 mg theophylline/kg ip and 89
   mice were injected with 250-750 mg pyridoxine/kg ip as treatment.
   Decreased rates of seizure (42 vs 70\%, p<0.002) and death 29 vs 56\%,
   p<0.002) were observed. Six New Zealand White rabbits were given 115 mg
   theophylline/kg iv over 50 min followed by treatment with an iv bolus of
   115 mg pyridoxine/kg, with subsequent continuous drip infusion of 230
   mg/kg over 50 min. Serum theophylline levels and plasma PLP levels
   showed significant negative correlation prior to pyridoxine infusion
   with a mean peak theophylline level of 182 mu g/ml and a mean low PLP
   level of 64 nM/L. Electroenceph-alogram (EEG) tracings were obtained
   before infusions, during theophylline infusion and during pyridoxine
   infusion. All 6 rabbits developed abnormal EEGs during theophylline
   infusion and all 6 rabbit EEG patterns returned to baseline during
   treatment with pyridoxine. These findings suggest that pyridoxine may
   partially reverse theophylline-induced central nervous system toxicity.}},

Abstract = {{The present article is a retrospective analysis of previously published
   data. This analysis examined the effect of immersion in 18, 22 and 26
   degrees C cold water, on heat debt (kJ), substrate utilization {[}i.e.,
   R (respiratory exchange ratio) calculated using indirect calorimetry],
   and aerobic metabolic rate (i.e., V-O2 (oxygen consumption) 1 \#
   min(-1)] in 24 male volunteers (20-35 years) given a preexposure meal
   (60.2 g carbohydrate, 12.0 g protein, and 2.8 g fat at 60 min prior to
   the experimental trial) and examined during 90 min of immersion to the
   first thoracic vertebrae. Body composition was determined via underwater
   densitometry. Subjects were divided with respect to high body fat (HF;
   18-22\%, n = 12) or low body fat (LF; 8-12\%, n = 12) and randomly
   assigned to one of three water temperatures. Body heat debt and R did
   not differ between the LF or HF groups, between temperatures, or across
   time. Percent calories utilized indicated that for these experimental
   conditions the predominant substrate utilized between the LF and HF
   groups across time was derived from carbohydrate. In addition, V-O2 was
   greater (p = .0004) in the LF than HF group, and the latter was greater
   (p = .0013) in the 18 degrees C group versus the 26 degrees C group and
   increased across time (p = .0001); that is, V-O2 after 5 min of
   immersion was less than at 60 and 90 min, and values obtained after 30
   min of immersion were less than those at 90 min of immersion. Based on
   these data, it appears that the LF group would expend more calories
   (308.9 vs. 199.9 kcal, respectively) and more likely derive these
   calories from a carbohydrate source than the HF group during 90 min of
   cold water immersion. It would appear beneficial to consider a feeding
   supplement for the low-fat individual if immersion was in a more thermal
   stressful environment or extended for a protracted period of time.}},

Abstract = {{Rope-pumps are now widely promoted as a low cost, easily maintained
   means to improve water availability in developing countries. However, in
   some instances their acceptance has been limited by concerns over the
   microbiological quality of the water. This study looked at the well
   water quality under a variety of conditions, comparing unimproved bucket
   and rope wells with wells with a windlass and rope-pump wells with and
   without a concrete cover. Other factors influencing the water quality
   were also examined.
   Results indicate a 62\% reduction of the geometric mean of the faecal
   coliform contamination of the well water as a result of the installation
   of a rope-pump with or without a concrete cover. Other factors found to
   influence the level of contamination of water in hand-dug wells were
   rainfall, number of households using the well, amount of water extracted
   daily and the distance of the well from the nearest kitchen. The last
   three factors probably reflect domestic activities with poor hygiene
   around the well.
   The installation of a simple rope-pump on family wells improves the
   water quality and availability at a favourable cost/benefit ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Background. To evaluate the success of a novel approach to twin studies
   using death discordant twin pairs in a disease of low prevalence.
   Method. A population study based on all registered deaths at the Office
   of Population Censuses and Surveys of England and Wales, classified
   under the ICD code 335.2 (motor neuron disease {[}MND]) for the period
   1979-1989 inclusive. From the above database of 10 872 people,
   individuals born after 31 December 1899 were traced in the Birth Indices
   for England and Wales to enable identification of possible twins. In all
   131 twin pairs were found and the cc-twin details were sent to the
   National Health Service Central Register (NHS-CR) to enable location of
   the relevant Family Health Services Authority and thence the co-twin's
   general practitioner (GP). A letter requesting access was sent to the
   family practitioners. If given, the co-twin can be approached and
   interviewed.
   Results. The search produced: 54 living co-twins; 31 who died as adults;
   29 infant deaths; 5 emigrated; 3 incorrectly diagnosed index twins; and
   9 untraceable co-twins. Among the adult deaths two concordant pairs were
   identified. This has created the largest twin population sample
   worldwide for MND.
   Conclusion. This new twin study method is clearly viable, and has
   produced a large unbiased sample compared to that possible using
   traditional methods. It relies heavily on the accuracy of death
   certificates and zygosity reporting by living cc-twins, but is possibly
   the only way of collecting twins in rare conditions.}},

   purebreds contributed. Heritabilities (h(2)) and genetic (r(g)) and
   phenotypic (r(p)) correlations were estimated for growth traits, calving
   difficulty of calves with dams of different ages, and gestation length.
   Coefficients of variation and ag generally were similar for composites
   and contributing purebreds. Generally, estimates of h(2) were similar
   for all breed groups combined, contributing purebreds combined, and
   composites combined. Estimates of h(2) for calving difficulty were
   higher for calves with 2-yr-old dams than for calves with dams greater

   a useful selection criterion for reducing calving difficulty. Mean h(2)
   pooled within all breed groups ranged from .35 for 200-d weight and
   368-d weight to .48 for 368-d height. Estimates of h(2) for subjective
   scores of anatomical traits were only slightly lower than those for
   growth and size traits. The h(2) of scrotal circumference (.43) was
   similar to those for growth and size traits. Genetic correlations
   between birth weight and calving difficulty were similar for 1) calves
   with darns of all ages, 2) calves with 2-yr-old dams, and 3) calves with
   dams greater than or equal to 3 yr old. The r(g) of gestation length
   with birth weight was low (.21) and was .57 and .54, respectively, with
   calving difficulty score and with percentage calving difficulty for
   calves with darns 2 3 yr old. Phenotypic correlations were relatively
   high among growth and size traits and were intermediate between birth
   weight and both expressions of calving difficulty in calves with

Abstract = {{The mechanism of action of antirheumatic gold drugs, such as disodium
   aurothiomalate (Au(I)TM), has not been clearly identified. Gold drugs
   inhibit T cell activation induced by mitogen and anti-CD3 mAb in vitro
   at relatively high concentrations. However, since gold drugs fail to
   induce immunosuppression in vivo, the pharmacologic relevance of this
   finding is doubtful. In this study, we asked whether Au(I)TM interferes
   with processing and presentation of defined Ags to T cells. Using a
   panel of murine CD4(+) T cell hybridomas, we found that low
   concentrations of Au(I)TM (less than or equal to 10 mu M) led to a
   markedly reduced IL-2 release of T cell hybridoma clones that recognized
   peptides containing two or more cysteine (Cys) residues, such as bovine
   insulin A1-14. Since disodium thiomalate alone had no effect, the
   inhibition was due to Au(I). IL-2 production induced by anti-CD3 mAb
   stimulation was not affected by the low concentration of Au(I)TM used.
   Au(I)TM had no effect on the presentation of peptides containing no or
   only one Cys residue(s). In contrast to the unmodified insulin peptide
   A1-14, Au(I) could not inhibit recognition of an insulin peptide in
   which Cys residues in positions 6 and 11 were replaced by serine. Most
   likely, the observed inhibition is mediated by formation of chelate
   complexes between Au(I) and two Cys thiol groups of the affected
   antigenic peptides. The peptide-specific inhibitory effect of Au(I) on
   Ag presentation described here might contribute to the therapeutic
   effect of Au(I) compounds in rheumatoid arthritis.}},

   These antibodies act by interacting with the E1 and E2 glycoproteins on

   until after exposure to acidic pH. A single neutralizing epitope (E1-c)
   includes E1 residue 132. Two dominant neutralizing domains have been
   identified on the Sindbis virus E2: E2-ab from E2-190 to 214 and E2-c
   from E2-62 to 159. E2-ab is likely to form a single loop and contain
   linear determinants while E2-c is strictly conformational involving
   several sites on the linear molecule. Both neutralizing and
   non-neutralizing E1 and E2 MAbs can protect and promote recovery from
   fatal encephalitis. E2 MAb can clear infectious virus from persistently
   infected cells by a non-cytolytic process and acts synergistically with

Abstract = {{The responses of an expanded hierarchy of barotropic vorticity models to
   the anomalous tropical divergence associated to the El Nino event of
   February 1983 are analyzed. The discussion is focused on questions
   related to the interpretation of the results based on similar models by
   other authors. The main points are: (1) the importance of the vorticity
   advection by the divergent component of the wind for the extratropical
   response in an ENSO event, (2) the reason of the apparent success of
   more simple models which do not include this term, (3) the role of the
   upper level convergence near Indonesia for the development of the PNA
   pattern and (4) the relative insensitivity of AGCM's extratropical
   response to the longitudinal position of the equatorial convection along
   the Pacific Ocean, reported by Geisler et al. This paper emphasizes the
   major drawback of the barotropic model: the need for a correct
   specification of the divergence/convergence associated with an anomalous
   tropical heat source, in view of the fact that subtropical anomalies in
   the divergence field, induced by tropical heating, make significant
   contributions to the midlatitude response.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine whether familial nonmedullary thyroid carcinoma
   behaves like sporadic carcinoma of follicular cell origin.
   Design: Retrospective review.
   Setting: University medical center.
   Patients: Fourteen patients were treated for familial nonmedullary
   thyroid carcinoma between 1980 and 1994. Thirteen families were
   identified, with 30 affected individuals.
   Interventions: Patients were treated with coral or completion total
   thyroidectomy. Thirteen additional operations were performed to control
   recurrent disease.
   Main Outcome Measures: Stage, recurrence, and survival. Patients were
   followed up for a mean of 6.5 years.
   Results: In our 14 patients, 13 tumors were multifocal, and six of these
   were bilateral. The incidences of lymph node metastasis and local
   invasion were both 57\% (n=8). Seven patients (50\%) had recurrences
   during follow-up.
   Conclusions: Familial nonmedullary thyroid carcinoma has a high
   incidence of multifocality and invasion and a high rate of local
   recurrence. Aggressive initial treatment and careful follow-up seem to
   be indicated.}},

Abstract = {{This study describes quantitatively the effect of O-2 on the dynamic
   nuclear polarization (DNP) of water protons. It is shown theoretically
   how DNP enhancement is altered by the paramagnetism of O-2. The
   nonlinear effect of oxygen on the enhancement factor has been
   approximated by a first order expression that provides accurate
   predictions of the experimental results obtained with phosphate-buffered
   solutions of 2,2,6,6 tetramethyl-4-oxo-piperidine-N-oxyl. The proton
   relaxation rates and DNP line width were measured for nitroxide
   concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 10 mM and for oxygen partial
   pressures ranging from 0 to 760 mmHg. A method is suggested for the
   calculation of the nitroxide and oxygen concentrations of a sample,
   based on two measurements, one with on-resonance EPR irradiation, the
   other with slightly off-resonance irradiation. Although the correlation
   between the values for the actual and calculated oxygen concentrations
   is good, the accuracy of the calculated oxygen concentration values
   remains poor, because of the large number of parameters involved in this
   calculation.}},

Abstract = {{Aims-The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of
   instituting strict diabetic glycaemic control on the retinal macular
   microcirculation and to compare this effect with that observed in the
   main retinal veins.
   Methods-In 28 insulin dependent diabetic patients with poor glycaemic
   control a regimen of strict diabetic control, consisting of four daily
   insulin injections was instituted and maintained for 6 months, Retinal
   haemodynamics were investigated in the macular microcirculation by the
   blue field simulation technique and in the major retinal veins by a
   combination of bidirectional laser Doppler velocimetry and monochromatic
   fundus photography. Progression of diabetic retinopathy was assessed
   from fundus photographs taken at baseline and at the end of the study.
   Results-Institution of strict diabetic control resulted in a significant
   increase in leucocyte velocity in the macular circulation (p=0 . 013).
   No significant difference in this increase was observed between eyes
   that showed progression (n=8) and no progression (n=20) of retinopathy
   during the study. Significant correlations were found between relative
   changes over time of blood flow measured in the main retinal veins and
   relative changes of leucocyte velocity determined in the macular
   microcirculation at 2 months (p=0 . 008) and 6 months (p=0 . 001) but
   not at 5 days (p=0 . 49). in the eight eyes that showed progression of
   retinopathy, the product of leucocyte velocity and density at baseline
   was significantly higher than normal (p<0 . 05). During the length of
   this study, this product was also significantly higher in the eight eyes
   that showed retinopathy progression than in the 20 eyes that did not
   show progression (p=0 . 005).
   Conclusion-Our results suggest that increased flow in the macular
   microcirculation may be associated with progression of retinopathy, thus
   supporting the hypothesis that increased blood flow may play a role in
   the development of diabetic microangiopathy. Although there are
   correlations between the changes detected in the macular
   microcirculation and those measured in the main retinal vessels, there
   are also differences which need to be further investigated in order to
   better understand pathogenetic mechanisms.}},

   saturated as f(K +)(e) with apparent K-m values for external K-e(+)

   media. At the same K-e(+) concentration the
   ouabain-furosemide-insensitive K+ influx in Cl- medium was significantly
   greater than that in NO3- medium. We found no inhibitory effect of 1
   mmol . l(-1) furosemide on Na+ influx in frog red cells in Cl- medium,
   K+ loss from the frog erythrocytes in a K+ free medium was significantly
   reduced (mean 58\%) after replacement of Cl- with NO3-. Furosemide (0.5
   mmol . l(-1)) did not produce any significant reduction in the K+ loss
   in both media. The Cl--dependent component of K+ loss from frog red
   cells was 5.7 +/- 1.2 mmol . l(-1). h(-1). These results indicate that
   about two-thirds of the total K+ influx in frog erythrocytes is mediated
   by a K-Cl cotransport which is only partially blocked by furosemide.}},

Abstract = {{Cervical cancer incidence and mortality can be reduced by removal of
   precursor lesions detected at cytological screening. Organised
   screening, i.e. regular invitation of defined target groups, is
   generally considered more effective than opportunistic screening. The
   latter method however, is predominant in most settings. There is no
   scientific basis for advocating one type of screening or the other. Our
   aim was to compare the two types and to analyse their efficiency. We
   analysed 466 275 smears taken in an open cohort of 118 890 women during
   1969-88. A computerised database permitted standardised classification
   of all smears and complete ascertainment of cancer in situ through
   record linkage. The number of in situ cancers detected per 1000 smears,
   the detection ratio, was used as an outcome measure both in univariate
   analyses and in multivariate logistic regression models. Cancer in situ
   was detected in 1076 women in the study cohort, with a detection ratio
   of 3.0 at organised and 2.1 at opportunistic screening, yielding an
   unadjusted odds ratio of 0.69 (95\% CI 0.61-0.79). After adjustment for
   age and time period, the probability of detecting cancer in situ was
   around 25\% higher with opportunistic than with organised screening (OR
   = 1.26; 95\% CI 1.09-1.46). This difference in favour of opportunistic
   screening was most pronounced in the first 10 year period and
   disappeared during the last decade. The difference in efficiency between
   organised and opportunistic screening in the detection of cancer in situ
   was slight, if any. The dogma that organised screening is significantly
   more efficient than the opportunistic type needs reconsideration.}},

Abstract = {{Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is by far the most frequent malignant
   disease in children. In all, 5\% of the boys affected will develop
   testicular disease either at initial presentation or during the disease
   course ol as the first site of relapse. Modern treatment regimens have
   reduced the occurrence of testicular relapses, which was more frequent
   in the 1970s. There is no place for preventive measures for early
   recognition of testicular leukemia; routine biopsies have been
   abandoned, and prophylactic irradiation is not justified. In gross overt
   disease, orchiectomy is justified (1) in cases of huge bulky testicular
   disease, (2) if unilateral disease is probable, and (3) if radiation of
   the testes is refused. In malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, orchiectomy
   may eventually be the best mode of diagnosing the disease if a boy
   presents with testicular enlargement. Standard local treatment, however,
   is irradiation of both testes, if both are affected.}},

Abstract = {{The Rhine Graben rift stretches for 300 km from Basel to Frankfurt. The
   axis of maximum subsidence switches from west in the southern graben, to
   east in the northern graben. Subsidence in the south began in the upper
   Eocene and was interrupted in the mid-Miocene by a broad uplift of
   1-1.5km in the Vosges-Schwarzwald (Black Forest) region, whereas
   subsidence in the north proceeded continuously from the lower Oligocene
   to the present.
   A combined geophysical and geological interpretation of the Rhine Graben
   is presented in the form of a 3-D gravity model and 2-D flexural plate
   modelling from the Alps across the Alpine, foreland to the Rhenish
   Massif. Modelling is based on crustal structure revealed by geologic,
   gravity and seismic data, including ECORS, DEKORP and EGT profiles.
   The 3-D gravity modelling supports a modest density contrast of 0.3 g
   cm(-3) at the crust-mantle boundary. Since there is no evidence of a
   large-scale upper-mantle anomaly, a dense lower crust (2.9-3.0 gcm(-3))
   is proposed as the cause of this modest density contrast. The presence
   of a dense, mafic, lower crust in south-west Germany is corroborated by
   lower-crustal xenoliths, elevated P-wave velocities (6.7-7.2 km s(-1))
   and high Poisson's ratios (0.26-0.29).
   Residual gravity and magnetic data reveal strong crustal
   heterogeneities, particularly from the dense, magnetic Saxothuringian
   Terrane to the light, non-magnetic Moldanubian Terrane. The polarity of
   the asymmetric Rhine Graben reverses at this Variscan tectonic boundary.
   Light graben fill can account for nearly the entire 20-40 mGal,
   short-wavelength gravity minimum, but the presence of intrusive bodies
   ranging from granitic to mafic composition can also strongly influence
   the local gravity field.
   2-D modelling of the flexure of the European lithosphere along seven
   1000km long profiles indicates a flexural bulge of 1-1.5km in the Alpine
   foreland of Southern Germany, which corresponds to an ENE-trending Moho
   uplift of the same magnitude and to a band of free-air gravity highs.
   Longer flexuraI wavelengths in the east indicate increasing lithospheric
   rigidity and increasing elastic thickness towards the Bohemian Massif.
   The Vosges-Schwarzwald dome is interpreted as the intersection of the
   Oligocene Rhine Graben rift and associated rift flank uplift with the
   mid-Miocene flexural bulge.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of acute exercise on vitamin B-6 metabolism was assessed in

   vitamers (Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, PLP; pyridoxal, FL; pyridoxamine
   5'-phosphate, PMP; pyridoxamine, PM; pyridoxine, PN) and pyridoxic acid
   (4-PA) by a reverse-phase liquid chromatography method in plasma,
   gastrocnemius muscle, liver, brain, heart, kidneys, and adrenals at rest
   (n=8) and after swimming for 1.0 h (n=8), 1.5 h (n=8), 2.0 h (n=8), and
   2.5 h (n=8). Results showed a significant increase in plasma total
   vitamin B-6 (PLP + PL + PM + PN), PLP and 4-PA levels in the exercised
   animals vs. control animals. Mean PLP muscle levels (nmol/g) increased
   significantly after 1.5 and 2.5 h of swimming. Liver PLP, FL, PM and
   total vitamin B-6 also increased significantly in the exercised animals.
   Concentrations of B-6 compounds in heart, brain, kidneys, and adrenals
   were not affected. Vitamer tissue content was also expressed as total
   amount (nmol per organ) since liver and muscle weights changed
   significantly after exercise. PLP, PMP and total vitamin B-6 increased
   in muscle while PLP tended to decrease in liver. Our results indicated
   that acute exercise induced changes in vitamin B-6 metabolism including
   a retentive capacity and temporary deposition of vitamin B-6 stores in
   skeletal muscle. Further studies are needed to delineate the mechanisms
   involved in the regulation of vitamin B-6 distribution, transport, and

   initial emphasis on improving direct energy input efficiency towards a
   stage of reducing the indirect energy requirements by shifting away from

   molm(-3) were measured in the temperature range 14-400 K and in the
   temperature and frequency ranges 100-200 K and 10 Hz-1 MHz,
   respectively. The beta-glass transition due to a freezing-in of the
   rearrangement of Ag+ ions was observed by adiabatic calorimetry for the
   glasses in the liquid-nitrogen temperature region, and the conductometry
   was suggested to see the same mode of Ag+-ion motion as the calorimetry.
   It was found that the development of the network structure of the glass
   former at constant AgI concentration resulted in the decrease of the
   P-glass transition temperature and the activation energy for the
   diffusional motion of Ag+ ions and in the increase of the heat-capacity
   jump associated with the glass transition. The results support the
   amorphous AgI aggregate model for the structure of the conductive region
   in the glasses with relatively high AgI compositions, indicating that
   Ag+-ion conductivity is mainly dominated by the degree of development of

Abstract = {{The American Thoracic Society (ATS) has recommended the use of 24
   volume-time waveforms for the testing of spirometers. Although these
   waveforms include values of peak expiratory flow (PEF), they were not
   originally intended to test PEF meters but, rather, volume parameters
   for spirometers. In addition, the practice of using ATS volume-time
   Waveform 24 with varying multiplying factors does not provide the range
   of flow-time waveform shapes (rise times) needed to evaluate PEF meters.
   Accordingly, we have developed a set of 26 flow-time waveforms
   specifically selected to evaluate PEF meters. PEF and other flow
   parameters (rise time and time to PEF) can be directly measured from
   these flow-time waveforms. When PEF determined directly from the
   flow-time curve was compared with PEF determined indirectly from a
   volume-time curve (ATS-recommended algorithm with an 80 ms time
   segment), as much as a 10.7\% difference between the two methods was
   observed using a waveform with a fast rise time. In contrast, there was
   very little difference between the various methods of deriving PEF for
   waveforms with slower rise times. These 26 Row-time waveforms provide a
   means of defining PEF for the testing of software algorithms and the
   testing of PEF meters with computer-driven mechanical pumps.}},

Abstract = {{1 The effect of mollusc herbivory on regeneration from seed was
   investigated for six common grassland species by sowing into
   artificially created gaps in a grassland award. Molluscs were excluded
   from half the plots by application of molluscicide.
   2 Samples taken monthly from October 1993 until March 1994 showed that
   species composition was markedly influenced throughout the study by the
   application of molluscicide. Plots from which molluscs were excluded
   contained significantly larger seedling numbers of Agrostis capillaris,
   Senecio jacobaea, Stellaria graminea, Taraxacum officinale and Trifolium
   repens while Ranunculus acris populations were unaffected by grazing.
   3 Analysis of percentage cover during the final three months of the
   study, showed that the vegetation in ungrazed plots contained a
   significantly greater proportion of Agrostis, Stellaria, Taraxacum and
   Trifolium. In contrast, mean percentage cover of Senecio jacobaea and
   Ranunculus acris was significantly higher in grazed plots, in which
   Senecio accounted for up to 80\% of the vegetation.
   4 Significantly more Agrostis, Stellaria and Taraxacum inflorescences
   were recorded in ungrazed plots suggesting that mollusc herbivory
   influenced not only seedling survival, but also the fecundity of mature
   plants, Senecio and Ranunculus inflorescences were more frequent in
   grazed plots,}},

Abstract = {{Laurencia perforata (Bory) Montagne was originally described from the
   Canary Islands. It is a red alga characterized by its creeping thallus,
   with arcuate sub-erect branches attached to the rocky substrate or to
   other branches by small terminal secondary holdfasts. The sequential
   development of the holdfasts and their ecological role in the asexual
   reproduction of the plant are described. After meeting another branch of
   the substrate, the tips of arcuate branches begin to develop rhizoidal
   proliferations. In later stages these proliferations form discoidal
   secondary holdfasts, from which new axes may arise. This vegetative
   propagation process is rather common in natural populations.
   In the present paper, tetrasporangia of L. perforata are described for
   the first time. Tetrasporangia occur in right-angle disposition and are
   cut off abaxially. These characteristics together with those of the
   cortical cells confirms earlier suggestions on the taxonomic position of
   this species in the subgenus Chondrophycus.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Octreotide has proven therapeutically effective in carcinoid
   syndrome, but the rarity of carcinoid tumors has hampered detailed
   dose-ranging studies. This study analysed published dose-titration data
   on octreotide use in carcinoid patients to (a) investigate the relation
   between octreotide dose and efficacy and (b) establish octreotide dosing
   recommendations for maximum therapeutic benefit.
   Method: An exhaustive, computer-assisted literature search for published
   articles employing octreotide to manage patients with carcinoid syndrome
   was performed using several databases, The relation between octreotide
   dose and efficacy in decreasing urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid
   (5-HIAA) levels, flushing and diarrhoea was analysed for seven dose
   ranges by pooling data from selected articles,
   Results: Analysis of data compiled from 62 published studies revealed
   that maximum effective therapeutic doses of octreotide effectively
   controlled symptoms in up to 93\% of patients, and that increasing the
   dose of octreotide is associated with increased benefit with respect to
   control of flushing, diarrhoea and 5-HIAA levels,
   Conclusions: We recommend starting octreotide therapy at 100 mu g
   subcutaneously t.d.s. in patients with mild/moderate,
   non-life-threatening carcinoid syndrome. Since therapeutic response to
   octreotide varies markedly among patients, we recommend titrating the
   octreotide dose in increments of 50-100 mu g every 8 h until adequate
   symptom control is achieved.}},

   L-selectin: 1,130 +/- 272 vs 793 +/- 207 ng/ml {[}mean +/- standard
   deviation]; p < 0.0001 vs patients without enhancing lesions). Serum
   levels of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor (60 kd) were also
   raised (2.64 +/- 1.23 vs 2.17 +/- 0.69 ng/ml in subjects with other
   neurological diseases and 2.1 +/- 0.77 ng/ml in healthy control
   subjects; p < 0.05). Soluble VCAM-1 and L-selectin levels were
   correlated to concentrations of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor.
   In 13 patients with viral encephalitis, similar observations were made.
   Raised levels of soluble VCAM-1 and L-selectin probably reflect
   cytokine-induced endothelial cell and T-lymphocyte/monocyte activation
   occurring in the process of T-cell migration into the central nervous
   system. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha may be critically involved.}},

Abstract = {{A series of oxic and anoxic incubations examined the decay of two marine
   phytoplankton, the diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii and the coccoid
   cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp, in flow-through systems without
   macrozooplankton grazers. The major biochemical fractions of algal
   carbon (protein, carbohydrates, and lipid) were quantified over time
   together with bacterial abundance and activity. Oxic decay constants of
   bulk and individual biochemical fractions showed good agreement between
   both phytoplankters, suggesting that composition at the molecular level
   within a particular biochemical class does not influence decay rate as
   much as differences among the major biochemical fractions. Large
   differences in decay rates did exist among biochemical classes, with
   carbohydrates utilized most rapidly under oxic conditions, followed by
   protein and then lipid. Turnover times among the particulate pools
   ranged from 10.7 days for diatom and cyanobacterial carbohydrates under
   oxic conditions to over 160 days for cyanobacterial lipids under anoxia,
   with oxygen having a substantial effect on overall rates of algal carbon
   decomposition. PON values tracked POC with an average POC:PON ratio of
   4.99 +/- 0.52 for diatoms and 4.48 +/- 0.66 for cyanobacteria throughout
   the experiments. Bacterial abundances and activity varied substantially
   over the course of the incubations with greatest activity during periods
   of greatest particulate loss. Bacterial abundances and metabolism were
   comparable under oxic and anoxic conditions even though the amount of
   material degraded under anoxic conditions was significantly less than
   when oxygen was present, suggesting that oxygen increased rates of
   particulate material degradation.}},

   and the AB-type mixed dumbbell plays an important role in the
   determination of the segregation direction. When a large number of mixed
   dumbbells moves toward the sinks, enrichment of the lower concentration
   element occurs, because the AB-dumbbell includes the same number of A-
   and B-atoms. When mixed dumbbell migration is rare, on the other hand,
   the lower concentration element can be depleted, even if the
   self-interstitial dumbbell composed of that element moves more quickly.
   Consequently, the direction of RIS depends on the mobility of point
   defects as well as alloy compositions. When the RIS kinetics of a Cu-Au
   alloy is calculated with the model, good agreement is obtained with
   experimental results.}},

   constituent polymers in binary mixtures of homopolystyrene, either
   protonated (HS) or deuterated (DS), and polystyrene-block-polyisoprene
   (SI) by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and neutron scattering

   are both similar to that of the polystyrene block (PS) in SI. The
   results show that the added homopolymer is solubilized in the PS
   microdomains, and the polyisoprene lamellae have a thickness independent
   of the volume fraction of the homopolymer, but the undulation of their
   interface increases with homopolymer content, These findings imply that
   the homopolymer is localized in the middle of the PS microdomains. The

   on the penetration depth of 11 +/- 1 nm between the DS chains and the PS

Abstract = {{In the adult skeleton, bone formation is regulated by an event referred
   to as the coupling of formation to resorption (i,e,, formation is linked
   to resorption), which is thought to be mediated in part by locally
   produced growth factors, Although human bone cells produce and human
   bones contain a variety of growth factors, there is sufficient evidence
   to document an important role for the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)
   system in mediating this coupling process in bone, Studies on the basic
   aspects of the IGF system in bone reveal that it is complex and involves
   a number of components which include the IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs;
   mainly IGFBP-3, -4, and -5), specific extracellular IGFBP proteases, and
   receptors (types 1 and 2), Based on recent experimental evidence from a
   number of laboratories, we propose the following models of IGF action on
   the regulation of the coupled increase in bone formation in response to
   bone resorption: (1) IGF release from bone during bane resorption
   promotes osteoblasts to initiate cavity refilling; (2) IGF production by
   osteoclasts creates a population of osteoblasts in proportion to the
   volume of bone tissue resorbed; and (3) IGF production by stromal cells
   and osteoblasts predominantly regulates the extent of cavity refill, The
   amount of growth factor production by osteoblasts and contemporary cells
   of osteoblast lineage can be further controlled by both systemic and
   local factors which together determine the eventual level of fill-in of
   the resorption cavity, For example, parathyroid hormone (stimulated
   during calcium deficiency) causes overproduction of IGFBP-4, a binding
   protein that inhibits the anabolic action of IGF-II in human bone cells,
   which may subsequently lead to a condition in which the resorption
   cavity is underfilled in bone; whereas an example of local control in
   bone cells may be demonstrated by the acute production of IGF-II after
   exposure to low-amplitude-frequency electrical fields (electric fields
   may mediate the effects of exercise), which may promote overfilling of
   the resorption cavity, In conclusion, growth factors such as IGFs
   probably determine the extent of resorption cavity refilling, which is a
   key event inasmuch as underfilling results in osteoporosis and
   overfilling may provide a treatment for osteoporosis.}},

   These systems have good angular resolutions of about 3 degrees FWHM at

   image reconstruction is employed, and coarser angular resolutions of
   about 10 degrees FWHM elsewhere within a wide field of view of 50

Abstract = {{A method based on the animal model is described which allows the
   estimation of continuous changes in variance components over time using
   restricted maximum likelihood (REML). The method was applied to the
   analysis of a selection experiment in which a foundation population
   formed from a cross between two inbred strains of mice (C57BL/6J and
   DBA/2J) was divergently selected for 6 week body weight over 20
   generations. The analysis suggested that there was an increase in
   phenotypic variance of about 50\% in the low selected lines over the
   course of the experiment which was attributed to increases in the
   environmental and additive variance components. Variance changes in the
   High selected lines were generally smaller than in the Low lines,
   although there was an estimated 20\% increase in the environmental
   variance. Simple models to explain these effects involving dominance,
   linkage and epistasis were explored. Testing which of these was
   responsible for the variance changes noted in this experiment (if any)
   is difficult, although the epistasis and dominance models require less
   stringent conditions than the linkage model, and the dominance model is
   supported by evidence of heterosis in the F-1.}},

Abstract = {{Thermococcus strain ES-1 is a strictly anaerobic, hyperthermophilic
   archaeon that grows at temperatures up to 91 degrees C by the
   fermentation of peptides. It is obligately dependent upon elemental
   sulfur (S-0) for growth, which it reduces to H2S. Cell extracts contain
   high aldehyde oxidation activity with viologen dyes as electron
   acceptors. The enzyme responsible, which we term aldehyde ferredoxin
   oxidoreductase (AOR), has been purified to electrophoretic homogeneity.
   AOR is a homodimeric protein with a subunit M(r) of approximately
   67,000. It contains molybdopterin and one W, four to five Fe, one Mg,
   and two P atoms per subunit. Electron paramagnetic resonance analyses of
   the reduced enzyme indicated the presence of a single {[}4Fe-4S](+)
   cluster with an S = 3/2 ground state. While AOR oxidized a wide range of
   aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes, those with the highest apparent
   k(cat)/K-m values (> 10 mu M(-1) s(-1)) were acetaldehyde,
   isovalerylaldehyde, and phenylacetaldehyde (K-m values of < 100 mu M).
   The apparent K-m value for Thermococcus strain ES-1 ferredoxin was 10 mu
   M (with crotonaldehyde as the substrate). Thermococcus strain ES-1 AOR
   also catalyzed the reduction of acetate (apparent K-m of 1.8 mM) below
   pH 6.0 (with reduced methyl viologen as the electron donor) but at much
   less than 1\% of the rate of the oxidative reaction (with benzyl
   viologen as the electron acceptor at pH 6.0 to 10.0). The properties of
   Thermococcus strain ES-1 AOR are very similar to those of AOR previously
   purified from the saccharolytic hyperthermophile Pyrococcus furiosus, in
   which AOR was proposed to oxidize glyceraldehyde as part of a novel
   glycolytic pathway (S. Mukund and M. W. W. Adams, J. Biol. Chem.
   266:14208-14246, 1991). However, Thermococcus strain ES-1 is not known
   to metabolize carbohydrates, and glyceraldehyde was a very poor
   substrate (k(cat)/K-m of < 0.2 mu M(-1) s(-1)) for its AOR. The most
   efficient substrates for Thermococcus strain ES-1 AOR were the aldehyde
   derivatives of transaminated amino acids. This suggests that the enzyme
   functions to oxidize aldehydes generated during amino acid catabolism,
   although the possibility that AOR generated aldehydes from organic acids
   produced by fermentation cannot be rules out.}},

Abstract = {{Several characteristics of the r.f. glow discharge were examined to
   determine their dependence on driving frequency. The cathode potential
   exhibited a strong dependence on frequency, as would be expected,
   because of the capacitive nature of the discharge. As the frequency was
   dropped from 13 to 6 MHz there was a dramatic rise in the r.f. voltage
   of the discharge (with a conductive sample), attributed to a change in
   the mode of power coupling. The sputtering rates of a conductive sample
   were dramatically greater at the lower frequencies, in part due to
   higher energy of the sputtering ions. The emission characteristics of
   the source also changed as the frequency was varied from 6 to 13 MHz. At
   the higher operating frequencies, atomic emission peaked at a particular
   r.f. power level, whereas at lower frequencies the neutral-atom signal
   generally increased monotonically with power. The highest signal levels
   were found at 20 MHz, the highest frequency studied. Detection limits
   were determined for both conductors and insulators; in both cases they
   are detector-noise-limited because of the low throughput of the
   spectrometer. Detection limits for a conducting sample ranged from 0.1
   mu g g(-1) at 20 MHz to 20 mu g g(-1) at 3 MHz. The emission from an
   insulating sample showed the same trends as those from a conducting
   sample but required higher r.f. power; the greatest signals were found
   at 6 and 13 MHz because not enough power was available from the r.f.
   amplifier to reach the optimum power for the 20 MHz discharge. Detection
   limits for elements in a Macor(R) ceramic sample ranged from 30 to 110
   mu g g(-1).}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To assess risk factors for hepatitis A infection among
   homosexual and bisexual men during a community-wide outbreak of
   hepatitis A in New York City.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five homosexual acid bisexual men, 20 to 49
   years of age with hepatitis A identified from health department
   surveillance data (cases) were compared with 42 homosexual and bisexual
   men of similar age distribution who were seronegative for hepatitis A
   virus and Identified from private physician offices (controls). Odds
   ratios (OR) were determined for acute hepatitis A infection according to
   demographics, numbers of sexual partners, frequency of specific sexual
   behaviors, and self-reported human immunodeficiency virus status.
   RESULTS: Cases had more anonymous sex partners (0 to 1 partner versus >1
   partner) than controls during the 6 weeks before illness onset (OR =
   4.4, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 1.4 to 14.4). Cases were more
   likely than controls to have engaged in group sex (OR = 3.8, 95\% CI 1.1
   to 12.6). Among specific sexual behaviors examined, oral-anal
   intercourse (oral role) and digital-rectal intercourse (digital role)
   with anonymous sex partners were more commonly reported by cases than
   controls (OR = 9.7, 95\% CI 1.2 to 78.7 and OR = 2.6, 95\% CI 1.0 to
   7.4, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that >1 anonymous sex
   partner, group sex, oral-anal intercourse, and digital-rectal
   intercourse were associated with illness in models controlling for
   duration of sexual activity. Because these variables were highly
   correlated, independent risk could not be evaluated in a single model.
   CONCLUSIONS: Hepatitis A infection among homosexual and bisexual men is
   associated with oral-anal and digital-rectal intercourse, as well as
   with increasing numbers of anonymous sex partners and group sex. These
   findings reinforce the importance of developing educational activities
   for homosexual and bisexual men that focus on risk reduction for
   hepatitis A as well as other sexually transmitted diseases spread via
   the fecal-oral route.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Mycosis fungoides (MF) is a non-Hodgkin's T-cell lymphoma of
   the skin that often begins as Limited patches and plaques with slow
   progression to systemic involvement. No studies have been published
   comparing photochemotherapy (PUVA) with ether topical therapies in the
   treatment of early-stage disease.
   Objective: The purpose of the study was to examine our long-term
   experience using PUVA to treat early-stage MF and to compare its
   effectiveness and side-effect profile with other previously reported
   topical therapies.
   Methods: Eighty-two patients with MF (83\% stage IA or IB) were treated
   with PUVA. Clinical and histologic features were observed for a period
   from 2 months to 15 years (median, 43 months).
   Results: A response was noted in 78 patients (95\%) with complete
   clinical and histologic clearing in 53 patients (65\%) for all stages.
   The mean duration of total complete response to PUVA for all stages was
   43 months (3.6 years). The mean survival of our study group for all
   stages was 8.5 years. Signs of chronic actinic skin damage were found in
   10\% of patients, including three patients with basal cell carcinomas
   and three patients with squamous cell carcinomas. In a nonrandomized
   comparison with previously reported data for other topical therapies,
   the efficacy and side-effect profile of PUVA compared favorably.
   Conclusion: PUVA is an effective and safe therapy for MF with prolonged
   disease-free remissions being achieved. Patients with stage I and II MF
   respond best to PUVA. Palliative therapy with PUVA is useful in more
   advanced cases of MF.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to assess the change of platelet and
   fibrinogen concentrations and the change of activities of prothrombin
   and factors V and VII when major surgical blood loss was replaced with
   plasma-poor red cell concentrates (RCCs) and colloid plasma substitutes.
   Sixty patients were studied. The average blood loss was 65\% +/- 41\% of
   the calculated blood volume (CBV). Blood loss was monitored carefully
   and replaced without delay to ensure stable blood volume. Blood samples
   were obtained at the induction of anesthesia and at the end of the
   recovery room period, or before the patient was given fresh frozen
   plasma. In addition, a platelet count was determined after each 20\%
   blood loss. The results were converted to relative values, and simple
   Linear regression with logarithmic transformation was applied. The
   initial platelet concentration was 257 +/- 89 x 10(3)/mm(3) and the
   extrapolation of the regression line intercepted the critical level of
   50 x 10(3)/mm(3) at 230\% (confidence interval 169\%-294\%) blood loss.
   The initial fibrinogen concentration was 3.7 +/- 1.1 g/L and the
   hemostatically significant level of 1.0 g/L was already reached at 142\%
   (117\%-169\%) blood loss (r(2) = 0.90). Activities of prothrombin and
   coagulation factors V and VII reached their critical levels at 201\%
   (160\%-244\%), 229\% (167\%-300\%), and 236\% (198\%-277\%) blood loss,
   respectively. We conclude that deficiency of fibrinogen develops earlier
   than any other hemostatic abnormality when plasma-poor RCCs are used for
   the replacement of major blood loss.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{It is difficult to talk about ethics in Australia these days, because
   (a) the different metamoral languages make it difficult for people to
   communicate on moral matters; (b) there are no generally accepted
   criteria for assessing the meaning and truth of moral propositions; and
   (c) witness talks larger in these matters than theoretical expertise,
   and the ideals that favour the acceptance of credible role models are no
   longer generally accepted. We should not assume that we can say anything
   meaningful about `'business ethics''. One reason for this arises from
   the Australian experience of the `80s: the fruits of a profound cynicism
   are now with us, as prominent figures find themselves in court to defend
   their actions, and seem amazed that they are accused of doing anything
   wrong at ah. We may want to stop something like this from happening
   again, but if the language of business ethics meant nothing to these
   people, how can we hope that it will mean much to us, or to future
   generations? A second reason (or group of reasons) arises from the
   nature of ethics itself. Business ethics, after all, does not exist in a
   vacuum; its language will not mean much to people who do not agree on
   what they mean whenever they talk about right and wrong. Some people,
   for example, measure the rightness or wrongness of actions in terms of
   their consequences; for others, on the other hand, some actions are
   wrong, no mater what the consequences. How are they to talk to each
   other! What is at issue here is what ethical propositions mean, and how
   one can measure their truth. And there is another reason. As Socrates
   pointed out long ago, ethics is not a theoretical science, which can be
   taught and learnt as dispassionately as mathematics. It is practical,
   and so engages teacher and pupil in an entirely different way: one
   cannot say one thing, and do another. When you have read a journal like
   this, will you necessarily be a better person or a more honest
   businessman/woman?}},

Abstract = {{Reliable curvature estimation is an important goal in image analysis to
   provide viewpoint independent cues for shape classification. This paper
   presents a model of the relationship between the variance of curvature
   estimates and the image noise. Agreement to within 10\% is obtained for
   3D range data. A perturbation error analysis is performed on the local
   least square surface fitting algorithm which is commonly used to obtain
   partial derivative estimates in the presence of noise. The theoretical
   results are used to implement adaptive thresholding for surface type
   classification. This is compared with existing constant and
   semi-adaptive thresholding schemes. It is concluded that any
   pixel-by-pixel thresholding will produce poor results. The theoretical
   relationships provide the basis for a probabilistic approach.}},

Abstract = {{The free calcium concentrations in the nucleus ({[}Ca2+](n)) and in
   cytosol ({[}Ca2+](c)) of cultured human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblasts
   were estimated by confocal laser microscopy using the Ca2+-indicator
   Indo-(1). In resting HEL cells, the free cellular Ca2+-concentration
   significantly increased upon human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection, The
   ratio between {[}Ca2+](n) and {[}Ca2+](c) was not affected, Following
   stimulation by ATP or {[}Arg(8)] vasopressin (AVP), a differential Ca2+
   response of the HCMV-infected HEL cells was observed. While uninfected
   cells were highly sensitive to AVP and only poorly sensitive to ATP,
   infected cells showed a high responsiveness to ATP but not to AVP, This
   switch in sensitivity to the agonists was first observed at 24 h post
   infection. The Ca2+-rise following ATP or AVP stimulation was derived
   from intracellular Ca2+ stores. The magnitude of the ATP-induced
   Ca2+-rise increased upon infection, In contrast to non-infected cells
   where {[}Ca2+](n) > {[}Ca2+](c) during stimulation with AVP or ATP, no
   nucleo-cytosolic Ca2+-gradient was observed in infected cells,
   Furthermore, the magnitude of the Ca2+ rise in the two compartments was
   higher in ATP-stimulated cells. It is concluded that HCMV infection
   significantly Ca2+-homeostasis in HEL cells which could be related to
   the pathogenesis of the disease.}},

Abstract = {{The present study describes the effect of kynurenic (KYNA) and
   5,7-dichlorokynurenic (DCKA) acids, acting as selective antagonists at
   the glycine site on the NMDA receptor complex, upon short-term memory of
   male rats. Oxiracetam (OXIR) or pramiracetam (PRAM) were used as
   reference compounds. In the social recognition test, adult animals were
   injected SC with a drug or vehicle immediately after the first exposure
   to a juvenile male, 21-24 days old, and reexposed to the same or a novel
   juvenile 120 min later. Time spent by adults in social investigation of
   juveniles was measured. Animals treated with KYNA or DCKA (0.3, 3 and 30
   mg/kg in both cases) and OXIR (30 and 60 mg/kg) had significantly
   reduced investigation time when reexposed to the same juvenile as
   compared to controls. No reduction of investigation time was found in
   those drugged animals reexposed to a novel juvenile. The findings
   suggest that KYNA and DCKA. improved retention of memory for olfactory
   stimuli in adult male rats. In the object recognition test, the duration
   of exploration of two identical objects during the sample trial and the
   familiar and a new object during the choice trial, performed 60 min
   later, was evaluated. Drugs or vehicles were administered SC 30 min
   prior to the sample trial. On choice one, animals treated with KYNA or
   DCKA (0.6 and 30 mg/kg in both cases) and PRAM (30 mg/kg) spent more
   time in exploring a new object than the familiar one as compared to
   controls. This suggests that the drugged animals were able to remember
   the familiar object. It may be concluded that KYNA and DCKA participate
   in mechanisms underlying recognition/memory processes in rats.}},

Abstract = {{We measured changes in maximal oxygen uptake capacity (VO(2)max),
   ventilation, heart rate, plasma lactate and speed at the end of an
   incremental exercise test as a consequence of a relay foot race from
   Paris to Dakar in 6 subjects. Additionally, anthropometric measurements
   were taken and muscle biopsies from M. vastus lateralis were obtained
   before and after the race. The latter were analyzed with morphometric
   methods for fiber size, capillarity and muscle ultrastructural
   composition. Weight specific VO(2)max was significantly reduced from
   62.4 to 60.5 ml/min kg after the race while absolute VO(2)max and the
   other endurance related functional variables remained unchanged, Body
   fat, thigh cross-sectional area and thigh volume showed tendential
   reduction immediately after the race but regained pre-race values within
   a few days. Fiber size and capillarity were not affected by the race.
   Volume density of total mitochondria was significantly reduced from 6.98
   to 4.89 \% of fiber volume. Both subsarcolemmal and interfibrillar
   mitochondria were significantly reduced by 59 and 21 \%, respectively.
   The volume density of satellite cell was increased about three-fold
   whereas the content of lipofuscin remained constant. It is concluded
   that extreme endurance events such as a multi-stage relay race may
   induce a considerable loss of oxidative capacity of skeletal muscle
   tissue.}},

Abstract = {{The anti-hypertensive efficacy and safety of extended-release (ER)
   felodipine (5, 10 or 20 mg) and amlodipine (5 or 10 mg) once daily were
   compared in patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension in a
   double-blind, double-dummy, randomised, comparative study. A total of
   118 patients were allocated to a 12-week, double-blind treatment with
   either felodipine ER (n = 57) or amlodipine (n = 61). The
   anti-hypertensive effect was evaluated by measuring office blood
   pressure (BP) at baseline and after 4, 6, 8 and 12 weeks, together with
   24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) at baseline, on day 1
   of treatment and at the end of the study. The mean office BP changes
   from baseline to week 12 were -13.4 (+/-15.7)/-11.8 (+/-6.9) mmHg for
   felodipine ER (mean daily dose 11.2 mg) and -15.3 (+/-17.0)/-12.9
   (+/-7.3) mm Hg for amlodipine (mean daily dose 7.4 mg). All BP
   reductions were significant (P < 0.01) with respect to time, but
   differences between treatment groups were not significant. The mean
   ambulatory BP changes from baseline to end of the study were -11.6
   (+/-5.2)/-10.0 (+/-2.0) mm Hg for felodipine ER and -16.3 (+/-4.4)/-9.6
   (+/-3.0) mm Hg for amlodipine, both significant (P < 0.01). The fall in
   ambulatory SEP was significantly greater (P < 0.001) in the patients
   treated with amlodipine compared with felodipine ER whereas there was no
   difference between the groups with respect to ambulatory DBP. Both drugs
   were well tolerated with a withdrawal rate of 12\% equally distributed.
   Headache and flushing were significantly (P < 0.05) more frequent in the
   felodipine ER group, whereas oedema and palpitations were the same in
   both groups. Thus, 24 h ABPM reveals a greater reduction in ambulatory
   SEP in patients treated with amlodipine compared with felodipine ER
   whereas there is no difference in terms of ambulatory DBP or office BP.
   Amlodipine seems to be more potent on a mg-to-mg basis and induces fewer
   side-effects than does felodipine ER.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, I address recent feminist epistemological claims - in
   particular, those associated with `standpoint theory' and `feminist
   postmodernism' - arguing that they share difficulties with other forms
   of anti-positivist social theory and contribute to an impasse in social
   inquiry which is becoming increasingly acute. This impasse is traced to
   the displacement of explanation from the centre of theoretical concerns.
   In arguing this, I am not, however, proposing a return to positivist
   social science. The view that explanation can be equated with positivism
   that `empirical' equals `empiricism' - is a common misconception It has
   led some advocates of a distinct feminist epistemology to describe much
   research on gender issues as `feminist empiricism'. Such research, they
   argue, involves a paradoxical or contradictory reliance upon the very
   `masculine' epistemological criteria which feminist theory has done so
   much to challenge. In this paper I shall criticise this argument,
   proposing instead a `post-positivist' position in which empirical
   research is at the heart of any feminist challenge to mainstream
   approaches and the reconstruction of social theory.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature dependences of NMR spin-lattice relaxation times T-1 of
   N-15, N-14, Rb-85 and Rb-87, spin-spin relaxation times T-2 of N-14 and
   Rb-87, and NMR spectra of N-15 and Rb-87 in RbNO2 were observed in the
   plastic phase (Phase I) and the low-temperature phase (Phase II)
   obtainable below 264 K. We showed the presence of a new NO2- motion in
   Phase II with an activation energy of 12- 15 kJ mol(-1). This motion was
   assigned to NO2- reorientation about its C-2-axis by referring to the
   temperature dependence of the N-15 chemical-shift anisotropy and the
   reported data of the dielectric dispersion. In the plastic phase, we
   detected the NO2- isotropic reorientation with an activation energy of
   6.2 kJ mol(-1) and the ionic self-diffusion with 110 kJ mol(-1), which
   was confirmed by measuring electrical conductivity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an improved model for high density gas-solids
   stratified pipe Row, in which the particle-particle interactions between
   the suspension and the sliding bed are taken into account by introducing
   suspended particle distribution coefficients, and examines the
   transition of stable stratified flow. Furthermore, phase diagram,
   distribution of suspended particles, solids concentration and velocity
   are predicted by the present model. It is found that particles begin to
   drop out of the gas phase at the theoretical saltation point at which
   the velocity is higher than that at the Rizk saltation point. The
   turning point in a diagram of dimensionless sliding bed height versus
   Froude number is close to the Rizk saltation point, while the
   Muschelknautz and Wojahn critical point is reasonable as the lower limit
   of the stable stratified Row of fine particles. In the phase diagram,
   the minimum pressure-drop point is to the left of the Rizk saltation
   point. Solids concentration in stable stratified flow is much lower than
   that of its loosely packed bed. In suspension, at most 25\% of suspended
   particles saltate over the surface of the sliding bed. Velocity ratios
   of solids-to-actual gas and sliding bed-to-superficial gas increase with
   Froude number except at very low Froude numbers.}},

Abstract = {{Background: With the emphasis on asthma as a chronic inflammatory
   process, the management of moderate to severe asthma, even in the
   pediatric population, has shifted to the regular use of inhaled
   anti-inflammatory agents, including inhaled corticosteroids.
   Accompanying the use of these agents has been the precaution that
   long-term use may have subtle or potential side effects, including
   growth suppression or decreased bone mineral deposition.
   Objective: We sought to study the effects of inhaled anti-inflammatory
   agents on bone mineral density accumulation in growing asthmatic
   children. Included in this report is the longitudinal acquisition of
   bone mineral density in children with moderate to severe asthma.
   Methods: Bone mineral density in normal and asthmatic children was
   measured longitudinally by dual-energy absorptiometry. Bone densitometry
   was determined twice over a 7- to 16-month period in 21 asthmatic
   children and a 13- to 60-month period in 14 normals. These children with
   two longitudinal visits were compared with a group of 107 normal
   children who had a single bone mineral density measurement.
   Results: Nineteen of 21 asthmatic children used regular inhaled
   corticosteroids during the interval visits. The majority of the
   asthmatic boys had bone mineral density measurements, at both visits,
   that were at a higher percentile than normal boys with two visits.
   Asthmatic girls had bone density measurements at percentiles not
   significantly different than normal girls with two visits.
   Conclusions: The advancement of bone mineral density in asthmatic
   children provides support for the safety of inhaled anti-inflammatory
   medications on bone mineral density in children with significant asthma.}},

Abstract = {{To determine whether nitric oxide (NO) modifies cardiomyocytes directly
   or indirectly via peripheral autonomic neurons, the effects of NO were
   studied in long-term (3-6 wk) cultures of adult guinea pig ventricular
   myocytes alone as well as in cocultures with adult extracardiac
   (stellate ganglion) or intrinsic cardiac neurons. NADPH diaphorase was
   associated histochemically with cultured intrinsic cardiac and, to a
   lesser extent, stellate ganglion neurons. The beating frequency of
   ventricular myocytes cocultured with intrinsic cardiac neurons
   (M-intrinsic) or stellate ganglion neurons (M-stellate) increased by
   20-30\% (P < 0.001) after administration of the NO donor
   S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP); this effect was abolished by the
   guanylate cyclase inhibitor LY-83583. The beating frequency of
   noninnervated myocyte cultures was not affected by SNAP. The precursor
   of NO, L-arginine, also increased the beating rate (similar to 20\%; P <
   0.05) of M-intrinsic cocultures, not affecting that of M-stellate
   cocultures or noninnervated myocyte cultures. Augmentor effects induced
   by SNAP were no longer elicited in the presence of tetrodotoxin and were
   unaffected by beta-adrenergic or muscarinic receptor blockade. It is
   concluded that 1) NO-sensitive neurons are present in stellate and
   intrinsic cardiac ganglia, and these neurons increase the beating rate
   of cardiomyocytes in the presence of NO; 2) more NO-synthesizing neurons
   are present in M-intrinsic than M-stellate cocultures, since L-arginine
   increased the beating frequency of myocytes significantly only in
   M-intrinsic cocultures; and 3) the beating rate of noninnervated myocyte
   cultures is not directly affected by NO.}},

Abstract = {{The ultrastructure of Pyramimonas virginica, the only known
   ultraplanktonic species of Pyramimonas, has been examined in detail.
   This species differs from other species of Pyramimonas in the structure
   of the flagellar apparatus, the scaly periplast, the pyrenoid, the
   eyespot, location of the eyespot in the cell, and mitosis. The flagellar
   apparatus is simple and shows signs of reduction. A 2-2-2-2 microtubular
   root system is present but a rhizoplast was not found. A very short
   transitional helix (perhaps two rings) is present in the flagellar
   transition region, together with a short one-piece stellate structure.
   Numbering of individual flagella in different species of Pyramimonas has
   shown a surprising variation in the orientation of the flagellar
   apparatus relative to the rest of the cell. Thus the eyespot in the
   various species is located differently relative to the flagellar
   apparatus and to other organelles such as the nucleus (in Pyramimonas
   there is no connection between the flagellar apparatus and the eyespot
   via a flagellar root). Considerable experimentation has apparently taken
   place with regard to the orientation of the photoreceptor apparatus
   during the evolutionary history of the prasinophytes. In more advanced
   green algae this variability does not occur. In Pyramimonas four
   different flagellar apparatus/eyespot orientations have been detected,
   which has led us to a modified classification of the genus at the
   subgeneric level. New subgenera are proposed for P. virginica (subgenus
   Hexactis) and P. longicauda (subgenus Macrura).}},

Abstract = {{We present two patients with Cushing's syndrome due to ACTH-independent
   macronodular adrenal hyperplasia who showed marked plasma cortisol
   response to lysine-8-vasopressin (LVP) injection (from 930 and 731
   pmol/L to 2177 and 1920 pmol/L, respectively), while plasma ACTH levels
   remained undetectable. The ACTH independence of cortisol secretion in
   the two patients was determined from the following endocrinological
   findings. Plasma cortisol levels were not increased by
   corticotropin-releasing hormone injections and were not suppressed by
   high dose (16 mg) dexamethasone administrations. The plasma ACTH levels,
   measured by two independent sensitive immunoassays, were persistently
   undetectable even after corticotropin-releasing hormone injection,
   metyrapone administration, and bilateral adrenalectomy. The particular
   pathological finding of the two cases, atrophic lesions in nonnodular
   parts of the adrenal cortexes, also Indicated ACTH independence of the
   macronodular hyperplasia. In vitro examination revealed a direct effect
   of LVP on cortisol secretion from the adrenal cells of the macronodules.
   We also examined seven patients with Cushing's syndrome caused by
   adrenal adenoma and found a statistically significant plasma cortisol
   response to LVP injection. The direct effect of LVP was also
   demonstrated in cultured adenoma cells.
   In conclusion, we discover ed a direct adrenal effect of LVP on cortisol
   secretion in patients with ACTH-independent macronodular hyperplasia
   and, to a lesser extent, in patients with cortisol-producing adrenal
   adenoma. The cortisol response to LVP may serve to facilitate their
   diagnosis and choice of therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Some patients with diarrhoea predominant irritable bowel syndrome have
   increased rectal sensitivity. It is uncertain, however, whether the
   diarrhoea is a consequence of the rectal sensitivity or if it is
   sensitising the rectum in some way. The aim of this inducing whether
   healthy volunteers can sensitise the rectum and therefore be a potential
   or partial cause of the sensitive rectum seen in some patients with
   diarrhoea predominant irritable bowel syndrome. The anorectal responses
   to balloon distension were measured in 20 healthy volunteers (aged 20-43
   years, 10 female) eight hours after laxative induced diarrhoea or under
   control conditions. Ingestion of an isosmotic laxative increased stool
   output from 1.1 (0.7-2.3) (median (range)) to 8 (5-19) bowel movements
   per day with no significant differences between men and women. In women
   rectal sensitivity was significantly increased after diarrhoea compared
   with control coditions (vol to induce discomfort (ml): 116 (96, 136)
   upsilon 153 (137, 168), mean (95\% CI); p<0.001). This was associated
   with a reduction in the volume to induce internal anal sphincter
   relaxation (16 (12, 20) upsilon 28 (21, 36); p<0.005), and volume to
   induce sustained internal and sphincter relaxation (70 (56, 84) upsilon
   90 (67, 113); p<0.03), but no significant change in rectal compliance
   (ml/cm H2O at 100 ml) 4.8 (3.5, 6.1) upsilon 4.1 (3.0, 5.1) or
   distension induced motility (motility index) 994 (341, 1647) upsilon 735
   (46, 1424). Conversely, in men diarrhoea had no significant effect on
   anorectal physiology and their control values were not significantly
   different from those of the women. In conclusion, the results of this
   study taken with the finding that irritable bowel syndrome is more
   common in women, suggests that the male or female sex hormonal
   environment may be an important factor in allowing the gut to be
   sensitised to noxious stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{To test the hypothesis that early maturation of barley affords it some
   resistance to cereal aphids, the colonisation, survival, growth,
   reproduction and emigration of M. dirhodum on barley was measured and
   compared with previously published results for this aphid on wheat.
   Barley plants were colonised as readily as wheat plants. Survival to
   maturity was similar on both hosts. Relative growth rate was higher on
   wheat than on barley for most of the season while reproduction was
   similar on both. Emigration, measured by alate production, was
   significantly higher on mature wheat than on mature barley.
   It is proposed that the increase of M. dirhodum populations on barley is
   normally terminated early in the year directly by plant maturation and
   consequent drying out of the leaves, resulting in the death of aphids.
   This is different to the situation on wheat, which matures later, and
   where emigration following plant induced alate induction has been shown
   to be the major factor affecting the decline in population growth.
   These results support the hypothesis that early maturation of barley
   provides some resistance to M. dirhodum.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To determine whether waist/height ratio is a useful predictor
   for coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors in men.
   DESIGN: An epidemiologic study comparing relationships between
   waist/height ratio, body mass index, waist/hip ratio and CHD risk factor
   levels {[}continuous variables - systolic and dialostic blood pressure,
   fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)), triglyceride,
   cholesterol, HDL cholesterol values] and the risk factor morbidity index
   (sum of the risk factor scores for hypertension, abnormal glucose
   tolerance, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia and low HDL
   cholesterol - one point each if present).
   SETTING: A health examination facility within a general hospital.
   SUBJECTS: 3131 men underwent routine health examination.
   RESULTS: Body mass index, waist/hip ratio and waist/height ratio were
   significantly associated with all of the risk factor levels and with the
   risk factor morbidity index according to the result of simple regression
   analysis. Multiple regression analysis for waist/hip ratio and body mass
   index showed that both of them were also significantly associated with
   all of the risk factor levels and with the risk factor morbidity index,
   except HbA(1c) levels with body mass index, According to the results of
   multiple regression analysis for waist/height ratio and body mass index,
   body mass index was not significantly associated with fasting blood
   glucose, HbA(1c), cholesterol levels or the risk factor morbidity index
   whereas waist/height ratio was significantly associated with all of the
   variables. On the other hand, while waist/height ratio was significantly
   associated with all of the variables, waist/hip ratio was not
   significantly associated with most of the variables when waist/height
   ratio and waist/hip ratio were compared.
   CONCLUSION: Waist/height ratio, an index of abdominal obesity, may be a
   better predictor of multiple CHD risk factors in men than waist/hip
   ratio in mass epidemiologic studies.}},

Abstract = {{Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) has a broad host range although in
   natural human infections the virus is neurotropic, establishing latent
   infections in sensory neurons where the viral DNA persists as an intact
   episome. The establishment of latency does not depend on viral
   replication functions, suggesting that infection of non-neuronal cells,
   including tissue of myogenic origin, by replication defective mutants
   may result in genome persistence in a similar episomal state. In this
   report a replication defective HSV-1 recombinant vector containing the
   beta-galactosidase reporter gene under transcriptional control of the
   strong human cytomegalovirus immediate-early gene promoter (HCMV
   lEP-lacZ) was used to infect muscle cells in vitro and in vivo. This
   replication defective mutant virus (d120), deleted for both copies of
   the essential immediate-early gene (lCP4) and thus incapable of
   expressing early and late viral genes, displayed highly reduced
   cytotoxicity in myogenic cells. This vector infected both myoblasts and
   myotubes in culture with transgene expression persisting for at least 8
   days. The transduction efficiency in myotubes was similar to myoblasts
   at several multiplicities of infection (MOls), suggesting that HSV could
   infect differentiated muscle fibers and that myoblast differentiation
   would neither prevent expression of the cellular receptor(s) for the
   virus nor inhibit viral penetration. Direct inoculation of mouse muscle
   fibers in vivo with 10(6) to 10(8) plaque forming units (p.f.u.) of
   vector was sufficient to transduce significant numbers of muscle fibers
   in newborn mice and some fibers in adult normal and mdx mice. These
   results suggest that recombinant HSV-1 vectors may be useful for gene
   transfer to muscle.}},

Abstract = {{The Penman-Monteith model is expressed in non-dimensional form. Scalings
   are selected such that the groups of dimensionless variables lie between

   extreme cases where very large or very small values are found,
   asymptotic analysis allows equation simplification.
   Hourly field data from savannah vegetation and pine forest are applied
   to each model term in its new form. For pine forest, the equation
   describing evaporation rates can be reduced to a single term. Describing
   savannah evaporation, the aerodynamic conductance is modelled in two
   different ways and subsequent values of calibrated parameters within the
   bulk stomatal response function are found to be strongly dependent on
   this. The model dependence of such parameters is more easily understood
   with equations in normalised form.
   A sensitivity analysis of the Penman-Monteith model to all driving
   variables is performed for both savannah and pine forest data.}},

Abstract = {{Part I. Pyrite, chalcopyrite, and sphalerite from six volcanic-hosted
   massive sufide (Mount Chalmers, Rosebery, Waterloo, Agincourt, Dry River
   South, and Balcooma) deposits in eastern Australia were analyzed using a
   proton microprobe to determine trace element abundances. In pyrite,
   trace elements can be divided into three groups according to the most
   likely occurrence of the element: (1) elements that occur mainly as
   inclusions (Cu, Zn, Pb, Pa, Pi, Ag, and Sb), (2) elements that occur as
   nonstoichiometric substitutions in the lattice (As, Tl, Au, and possibly
   Mo), and (3) elements that occur as stoichiometric substitutions for Fe
   (Go and Ni) or S (Se and Te). Hydrothermal and metamorphic
   recrystallization cleans pyrite of group 1 and group 2 elements, but
   does not appear to affect the concentrations of group 3 elements.
   Colloform pyrite grains have the highest levels of As and Au (up to 200
   ppm), suggesting that rapid precipitation is important in incorporating
   Au into auriferous pyrite.
   Elements that occur as inclusions in chalcopyrite include Pb, Pi, Zn
   (?), and Ba. The occurrence of As and Sb is unresolved, although
   consistently high values of As in some samples suggest that As may
   substitute into the lattice of chalcopyrite. Elements that substitute
   into the lattice include Ag (for Cu), In, Sn and Zn (?) (for Fe), and Se
   (for S).
   Lead, Ba Sb, possibly, and in some cases, Cu, occur commonly as
   inclusions in sphalerite. Lattice substitutions in sphalerite include
   Fe, Cd, Cu (to 4,500 ppm), Ni, In, Ag, Te, Ga and possibly Mo. In
   addition, consistently high (2,000-4,000 ppm) levels of As in the
   Rosebery barite zone may indicate As lattice substitution.
   Part II. The Se content of pyrite in volcanic-hosted massive sulfide
   deposits varies as follows: in Cu-poor, Zn-rich deposits, Se levels are
   low (mainly <5 ppm) throughout; in Cu-rich deposits, Se levels are
   highest ; (10-200 ppm) in stringer zones and the lower part of the
   massive sulfide lens, and decrease toward the top of the massive sulfide
   lens and into peripheral altered rocks. Metamorphic recrystallization
   does not affect these variations. Although delta(34)S values also vary
   systematically in individual deposits, no systematic differences were
   noted between Cu-rich and Zn-rich deposits.
   H2S and H2Se are the dominant aqueous S and Se species in volcanogenic
   fluids (1 m NaCl 0-2 units acid; Sigma H2S > Sigma SO42-) above 200
   degrees C. Under these conditions, pyrite Se levels are governed by FeS2
   + 2H(2)Se(aq) double left right arrow FeSe2 + 2H(2)S(aq), and H2Se/H2S
   approximates Sigma Se/Sigma S. Calculations using available
   thermodynamic data indicate that at constant H2Se/H2S, pyrite Se levels
   decrease with increasing temperature.
   Differences observed between Cu-rich and Cu-poor zones cannot be caused
   by temperature changes. The variations can be best accounted for by
   differences in Sigma Se/Sigma S of the hydrothermal fluids. Fluids that
   deposited pyrite in Cu-poor zones had Sigma Se/Sigma S ratios below 1 x
   10(-6), which is typical of evolved seawater, with minimal magmatic
   input (either from magmatic volatiles or from leached volcanic rocks) of
   Se and S. Fluids that precipitated Cu-rich stringer ore had Sigma
   Se/Sigma S ratios of 0.05-4 x 10(-4), which is consistent with a
   significant (>10\%) magmatic component. These interpretations are
   consistent with previous interpretations based on S isotopes (Ohmoto et
   al., 1983).}},

Abstract = {{The polychaete Platynereis dumerilii (Polychaeta: Nereidae) has been
   evaluated as a candidate bioassay species for marine ecotoxicity
   testing. The species conforms with many of the requirements of an ideal
   bioassay organism in that (i) it is amenable to laboratory culture, (ii)
   its relatively small size makes it convenient for handling and
   laboratory exposure studies, (iii) its diet is defined and can be
   controlled, (iv) it reproduces throughout the year and, using
   photoperiod manipulation, can be induced to spawn as required, and (v)
   it has a short life cycle (approximately 3 months at 20 degrees C)
   making it feasible to study the effects of xenobiotics on chronic
   endpoints such as reproduction. The components of the life history which
   have been examined to date include fertilization rate, embryo-larval
   development, and larval survival. These life stages were evaluated using
   the reference materials used in the 1991 International Paris Commission
   (PARCOM) Ring Test (namely, the biocides, Bioban P-1487 and Vantocil IB,
   and the widely used reference toxicant, 3,5-dichlorophenol). For
   fertilization rate, the median effect concentrations (1-h EC(50) values)
   were 0.32 mg . liter(-1) for Bioban P-1487, 1.99 mg . liter(-1) for
   3,5-dichlorophenol, and 9.66 mg . liter(-1) for Vantocil IB. For
   embryo-larval development, the median effect concentrations (48-h EC(50)
   values) were 0.29 mg . liter(-1) for Bioban P-1487, 2.13 mg . liter(-1)
   for 3,5-dichlorophenol, and 4.81 mg . liter(-1) for Vantocil IB. For
   larval survival, the median lethal concentrations (48-h LC(50) values)
   were 0.32 mg . liter(-1) for Bioban P-1487, 3.64 mg . liter(-1) for
   3,5-dichlorophenol, and 10.9 mg . liter(-1) for Vantocil IB. These
   results (all based on nominal values) suggest that, for these reference
   materials, the early life stages of P. dumerilii are of similar
   sensitivity to other marine invertebrate species. Together with the
   amenability of this species to laboratory culture, these data suggest
   that P. dumerilii has significant potential for use in marine
   ecotoxicity testing. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{In the agricultural business animals released for sale and slaughter are
   always selected from several fattening groups.  Single accounting is
   common with the system presently available to us, yet it is not possible
   to ascribe this to the original animal material.  The possibilities of
   bringing internal operational processes to an optimal standard are
   therefore limited.  The integrated production based on an electronic
   carcass identification system that is independent of personnel will
   provide the basic stock for an exclusive, final, and traceable high
   quality to meet the consumer's growing requirements.
   It is the complete and unbroken control in addition to a data flow in
   both directions that will enhance the cooperation between the animal and
   meat producers and allow a customer relationship based on trust.
   Only an unbroken chain of evidence proving the life path of each single
   animal with the assistance of a transitory and manipulative system that
   can be put into effect immediately, will supply the German animal and
   meat producer with the basis for improved competitiveness.
   The specific retracing of single animals to their stock origin for the
   perpetuation of evidence that quality requirements are being adhered to
   during all production stages, is of essential importance for the
   purposes of quality control and above all when referring to the growing
   feeling of uncertainty amongst consumers caused by the most recent
   events in connection with swine fever and BSE.}},

Abstract = {{The present study tested whether the pupillary response can be applied
   to study the variation in processing load during simultaneous
   interpretation. In Experiment 1, the global processing load in
   simultaneous interpretation as reflected in the average pupil size was
   compared to that in two other language tasks, listening to and repeating
   back an auditorily presented text. Experiment 1 showed clear differences
   between the experimental tasks. In Experiment 2, the task effect was
   replicated using single words as stimuli. Experiment 2 showed that
   momentary variations in processing load during a lexical translation
   task are reflected in pupil size. Words that were chosen to be more
   difficult to translate induced higher levels of pupil dilation than did
   easily translatable words. Moreover, repeating back words in a
   non-native language was accompanied by increased pupil dilations, in
   comparison to repetition in the subject's native language. In sum, the
   study lends good support to the use of the pupillary response as an
   indicator of processing load.}},

Abstract = {{Excessive proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMC) in the arterial
   intima is thought to be a major contributing factor to the development
   of atherosclerosis. One of the theories put forward to explain the
   aberrant growth is that genetic alterations similar to those observed in
   cancers also occur in the SMC. Since mutations in the p53 tumour
   suppressor gene and the c-Ki-ras oncogene are the most common genetic
   alterations observed in a wide variety of tumour types, we searched for
   evidence of mutation in human atherosclerotic tissue. DNA was extracted
   from atherosclerotic plaques and screened for p53 and c-Ki-ras gene
   mutations using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation
   polymorphism analysis. Tissue sections were also examined for
   overexpression of p53 protein using an immunohistochemical technique.
   The molecular analysis showed that wild-type p53 and c-Ki-ms gene
   sequences were present in all 54 specimens examined. Overexpression of
   p53 protein was found in 61\% of samples. Our results do not support the
   view that genetic alterations similar to those occurring in cancer
   contribute to the abnormal proliferation of SMC, although we caution
   that only two cancer-related genes were studied. Epigenetic changes to
   the gene products could play a role however, as evidenced by
   overexpression of p53 protein in many of the atherosclerotic specimens.}},

Abstract = {{An observational survey of stars selected from the region of sky in the
   direction of the Galactic bulge is presented. We discuss the choice of
   tracer populations for this study. Digitized UK Schmidt plate
   photometry, calibrated with CCD photometry, is obtained in 18 regions
   over the bulge. Stars are selected for spectroscopic follow-up from
   within a carefully chosen colour-magnitude selection window, optimized
   for efficient detection of bulge K giants. Some 1500 stellar spectra are
   obtained, with the AAT AUTOFIB facility, giving the largest data set yet
   obtained in this region of the Galaxy, by a factor of approximate to 10.
   We derive a radial velocity and metallicity for each star, and quantify
   the uncertainties in these measurements. Luminosity classification is
   derived both by visual classification and by using an automated routine
   based on Principal Component Analysis. There are two basic results from
   this survey: the discovery of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, which is
   described by Ibata, Gilmore \& Irwin, and a study of the Galactic bulge,
   which is presented in an accompanying paper.}},

   noodles and dairy beverages to which more than 200 mu g of gardenia
   yellow pigment as crocetin per 100 g of the processed foods had been
   added. The contents of gardenia yellow pigment in processed foods could
   be calculated by determining the recovery from model foods.
   The total contents of gardenia yellow pigment extracted from commercial
   unboiled noodles and dairy beverages were 3.5 mu g/g and 2.3 mu g/g as
   crocetin. From the recoveries (unboiled noodle: 45\%, dairy beverage:
   62\%) in these experiments, it was calculated that the commercial
   unboiled noodle and dairy beverage had been prepared with 750 mu g and
   370 mu g of gardenia yellow pigment as crocetin per 100 g of the
   processed foods, respectively. These values were close to those in the
   recipe used by the food company. The composition of gardenia yellow
   pigment from commercial foods was simillar to that of gardenia yellow
   pigment in the fruit.}},

Abstract = {{Background: After decades of decline in the incidence of severe
   infections secondary to group A streptococci, a dramatic increase in the
   frequency and severity of infections with these organisms has been
   reported since 1984, including a `'toxic Streptococcus syndrome,''
   resembling staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome. To the authors'
   knowledge, this entity has never been described after ocular infection.
   Methods: In a previously healthy 3-year-old boy, preseptal cellulitis
   developed secondary to minor trauma to the eyelid, progressing rapidly
   to hypotension, respiratory distress, and an erythrodermic desquamating
   rash, Ocular and blood cultures grew group A beta-hemolytic
   streptococci. Appropriate antibiotic coverage and management of systemic
   manifestations led to rapid improvement, although necrosis developed in
   the right upper anterior eyelid, requiring skin grafts.
   Results: More than 3 years since the incident, the patient is free of
   infection and has a good cosmetic result after skin grafting and
   revisions for scarring and adhesions.
   Conclusions: Streptococcal preseptal cellulitis is not unusual,
   particularly after trauma. Ophthalmologists must be aware of the
   re-emergence of more virulent organisms with increased potential for
   morbidity and mortality.}},

Abstract = {{A thermostable D-xylose isomerase from a newly isolated thermophilic
   Streptomyces sp. (PLC) strain is described. The enzyme was purified to
   homogeneity. It is a homotetramer with a native molecular mass of 183
   kDa and a subunit molecular mass of 46 kDa. The enzyme has a K-m of 35
   mM for D-xylose and also accepts D-glucose as substrate, however, with a
   tenfold higher K-m (0.4 M) and half the maximum velocity. Both the
   activity and stability of this D-xylose isomerase depend strongly on
   divalent metal ions. Two metal ions bind per subunit to non-identical
   sites. Mg2+, Mn2+ and Co2+ are of comparable efficiency for the D-xylose
   isomerase reaction. Co2+ is the most efficient cofactor for D-glucose
   isomerization. The enzyme remains fully active up to 95 degrees C. The
   activity decreases at 53 degrees C in the presence of Co2+ and Mg2+ with

Abstract = {{Lung ischemia-reperfusion represents a potentially important mechanism
   for diverse forms of tissue injury associated with decreased pulmonary
   flow. Previous studies demonstrated oxidative injury in
   ischemic-reperfused lungs. The present study was designed to evaluate
   the contribution of nitric oxide and peroxynitrite in tissue injury. The
   levels of the stable decomposition products of nitric oxide and
   peroxynitrite, nitrite plus nitrate, were twofold greater than control
   during reperfusion after 60 min of ischemia. Inhibition of nitric oxide
   synthesis by endotracheal insufflation of 5 mM N-G-nitro-L-arginine
   methyl ester, 30 min before the induction of ischemia, decreased the
   production of lung thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) by
   67\% (P < 0.05, n = 5), TBARS released into the lung perfusate by 55\%
   (P < 0.05, n = 5), lung-conjugated dienes by 61\% (P < 0.05, n = 5), and
   dinitrophenylhydrazine-reactive protein carbonyl levels by 86\% (P <
   0.05, n = 5). Amino acid analysis of tissue homogenates from lungs
   exposed to 60 min of ischemia and 60 min of reperfusion revealed a
   1.8-fold (P < 0.05, n = 5) increase in nitrotyrosine concentration
   compared with 2 h continuously perfused lungs. Inhibition of nitric
   oxide synthesis abolished the increase in nitrotyrosine levels.
   Furthermore, lungs exposed to 60 min of reperfusion after 60 min of
   ischemia showed specific binding of an anti-nitrotyrosine antibody. In
   reperfused tissues, antibody binding was observed throughout the lung.
   The binding was blocked with excess of nitrotyrosine, and minimal
   binding was observed in nonperfused blood-free control lungs. These
   results indicate that a strong oxidant derived from nitric oxide
   consistent with the reactivity of peroxynitrite contributes to the
   oxidative injury of isolated rat lung from ischemia-reperfusion.}},

Abstract = {{The curing reactions of benzoxazine precursors based on bisphenol A and
   aniline are studied to determine the feasibility of processing them into
   final phenolic parts. Benzoxazine precursors are able to overcome most
   of the shortcomings of traditional phenolic resins, and retain the
   excellent heat resistance and fire and smoke properties of these resins.
   This new type of phenolic material cures via a ring-opening mechanism
   that does not produce any condensation or other reaction by-products.
   Phenol is not used as raw material, which reduces considerably the
   environmental and health risks. According to differential scanning
   calorimetry (d.s.c.), the curing of benzoxazine precursors is an
   autocatalysed reaction until vitrification is reached, and diffusion
   begins to control the curing process afterwards. Isothermal and
   non-isothermal d.s.c. tests are performed. Calculations of the
   activation energy and the overall reaction order are made by various
   procedures. The vitrification times and the kinetic rate constants are
   also calculated.}},

   restricted to less than or equal to two but can be solved in polynomial
   time if the path lengths are restricted to be less than or equal to two

Abstract = {{Hydraulic resistance is an important factor in predicting water status.
   Hydraulic resistance of petiols, stems and branches, and roots was
   measured in Pasania edulis Makino in order to compare the distribution
   of resistance between current seedlings, current stump sprouts and a 16
   year old adult tree. Total resistance showed only minor variations
   despite large variations in plant size. This result is thought to be
   consistent with allometry between leaf mass and supportive organ mass,
   and with changes in permeability of conductive organs. Root resistance
   was low in sprouts and the adult tree due to their mature root systems.
   Current seedlings with undeveloped root systems had high root
   resistance. The proportion of petiol resistance in total resistance was
   high compared to the proportion of their conductive distance, and was
   thought to be a limiting factor of tree water status. The petiol
   resistance of the adult tree leaves was higher than for seedling and
   sprout leaves. From a comparison with the leaf water relation
   characteristics, the petiol resistance was thought to be provided as low
   values for intolerant leaves against water stress in order to compensate
   water inflow, and high values for tolerant leaves to regulate water
   inflow.}},

Abstract = {{Two experiments examined the influence of timbre on auditory stream
   segregation.  In Experiment 1, listeners heard sequences of orchestral
   tones equated for pitch and loudness, and they rated how strongly the

   ratings revealed that segregation was based on the static and dynamic
   acoustic attributes that influenced similarity judgments in a previous
   experiment (P. Iverson \& C.L. Krumhansl, 1993).  In Experiment 2,
   listeners heard interleaved melodies and tried to recognize the melodies
   played by a target timbre.  The results extended the findings of
   Experiment 1 to tones varying in pitch.  Auditory stream segregation
   appears to be influenced by gross differences in static spectra and by
   dynamic attributes, including attack duration and spectral flux.  These
   findings support a Gestalt explanation of stream segregation and provide
   evidence against a peripheral channel model.}},

Abstract = {{Corporate governance describes an apparent attempt by the corporate

   However, rather than the universal good which it would appear to be, by
   reference to the work of Foucault corporate governance is disclosed as
   partial and interested.  Far from being a new response to a contemporary
   problem, corporate governance is shown to have a long history, both of

Abstract = {{Objective To evaluate the effect of laser ablation of the prostate on
   symptomatic and urodynamic parameters and to compare laser delivery
   systems.
   Patients and methods The study comprised 81 patients of whom 79 were
   waiting for transurethral resection of the prostate (TURF) and two who
   presented in acute urinary retention. The 79 patients (median age 65
   years, range 45-82) underwent pre-operative urodynamics and all patients
   completed American Urological Association (AUA) symptom score
   questionnaires before surgery. Visually-guided laser ablation of the
   prostate (VLAP) was performed and the urodynamics and symptom scores
   were repeated 3 months later.
   Results The improvements in symptom scores and now rates were
   statistically significant and comparable with other published data.
   There were also significant improvements in voiding pressure. There were
   no significant differences between the various laser fibres used. There
   were few complications.
   Conclusion The effectiveness of VLAP in improving symptoms and now rates
   in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is confirmed. The
   procedure also reduced voiding pressure, confirming the relief of
   bladder outflow tract obstruction. VLAP is confirmed as a safe and
   effective treatment for BPH. Continued follow-up is needed to determine
   the long-term effects.}},

   interrupting the enteral cycle of radiocaesium in sheep. It was proved
   that ZEOFe accelerated approx. twice the excretion of Cs-137 from

   the equilibrium concentration of radiocaesium in the case of constant

Abstract = {{A series of new side-chain liquid crystalline polymers was prepared with
   a polycarbonate backbone, bearing (E)-4'-nitrostilbene mesogenic groups,
   connected to the backbone by spacers of different length. The polymers
   were synthesized in 1,4-dioxane by polycondensation of diphosgene and
   diol monomers with the general structure
   2-{[}omega-(4'-nitrostilben-4-yloxy)alkyloxy]-1,3-propanediol in the
   presence of pyridine as a proton trap and catalyst. The mesomorphic
   properties of all monomers, polymers and intermediates were studied by
   polarized optical microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry
   (DSC). The polymers were also studied by X-ray diffraction of
   non-oriented and oriented samples (fibres). All monomers were liquid
   crystalline with nematic and/or smectic phases. For the polymers a clear
   relation was found between spacer length and glass transition
   temperature (T-g), which decreases with increasing spacer length and
   between spacer length and clearing temperature, which increases with
   increasing spacer length. X-ray diffraction measurements indicated the
   presence of a smectic A double layer structure (S-Ad) for all polymers
   at room temperature, with an antiparallel alignment of overlapping
   mesogenic groups. A distinct difference in the orientation of the
   mesogens was found when fibres were drawn from the smectic phase or from
   the nematic or isotropic phase. In the first case the mesogenic groups
   were oriented perpendicular to the fibre axis and in the second case the
   mesogenic groups were oriented parallel to the fibre axis. By
   gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) measurements of heated samples and
   by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and DSC the polymers were found to
   be thermally stable up to temperatures well above their clearing point.}},

Abstract = {{The movements of tortricids between the apple orchard ecosystem and its
   surroundings were investigated. To record moth movements a bidirectional
   Malaise trap was placed on each margin of three IPM (integrated pest
   managed) and three abandoned apple orchards from the beginning of June
   to October 1992. Overall flight activity and activity of species
   associated with apple trees were considered. Diversity was explored by
   the Shannon-Weaver index and the two management systems were compared.
   Data were analysed with de-trended correspondence analysis (DCA), Mantel
   test and single linkage clustering.
   Results showed that the diversity did not correlate with management,
   even when the second axis of the DCA separated IPM orchards from
   abandoned ones. The first axis of the DCA confirmed the importance of
   the orchards isolation. Superposition of single linkage clustering
   revealed groups forming using DCA. The Mantel test allowed statistically
   checking of the similarity between emigrant and immigrant fauna. Two
   similarity model matrices were tested against data in the Mantel test.
   The six orchards showed no massive emigration or immigration, an
   indication that exchanges occurred locally.}},

Abstract = {{This paper has two major goals: 1) to study the effect of the common
   practice of neglecting the convective terms (inertial approximation) in
   the hydrodynamic model in the simulation of n(+)-n-n(+) diodes and two
   dimensional MESFET devices; and 2) to test analytical criteria,
   formulated in terms of characteristic values of the Jacobian matrix, as
   a method of determining the impact of first derivative perturbation
   terms in this model, and in related energy transport models. This
   characteristic value analysis can be thought of as generalizing the
   usual analytical solution of first order linear systems of ordinary
   differential equations with constant coefficients, Concerning 1), we
   find that the inertial approximation is invalid near the diode
   junctions, and near the contact regions of the MESFET device, In regard
   to 2), we find a proper arrangement of terms, expressing the flux, such
   that the first derivative part of the system is hyperbolic, both for the
   hydrodynamic model and the energy transport model, For the hydrodynamic
   model, two forms of the heat conduction term are studied, including the
   case of a convective term, This suggests and validates the use of shock
   capturing algorithms for the simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Postnatal differentiation of nonciliated bronchiolar epithelial (Clara)

   to both cell turnover rate and cell position in the airways. To test the

   bronchioles were examined in rats from gestational day 21 through
   postnatal day 100. The volume fraction of smooth endoplasmic reticulum

   the epithelial cell labeling index of terminal bronchioles decreased

   and the expression of cytochrome P450 isozyme 2B in Clara cells were
   examined along the entire length of the terminal bronchiole in animals
   1, 21, and 100 days of age. For all three characteristics, Clara cells
   showed a similar degree of maturation from the proximal bronchiolar
   bifurcation to the bronchiole-alveolar duct junction (BADJ) (a span of
   approximately 35 cells). We conclude that during prenatal and postnatal
   bronchiolar development in rats: (1) the Clara cell is the most actively
   dividing cell type for the lower airways; (2) the stage of Clara cell
   differentiation is inversely related to Clara cell mitotic activity; and
   (3) the heterogeneity of Clara cell maturation and mitotic activity is
   not influenced by position within the terminal bronchiole.}},

Abstract = {{Olive fruits (Olea europaea cv. Arolensis Hojiblanca var.) were
   processed as `'Spanish green olives''. The treatment included a first
   step at high pH (lye treatment), a lactic fermentation, and a final
   period of conservation in a high concentration brine. Four samples were
   taken in the critical moments of processing, and their cell wall
   material was isolated-and fractionated into several groups of
   polysaccharides. Lye treatment had its biggest effect on uronic
   acid-containing fractions such as water (WSF), oxalate (OSF), and
   chlorite/acetic acid (DEL) soluble fractions. Marked changes were
   detected in the relative percentage of each of these fractions,
   suggesting interchange of polysaccharides (mainly homogalacturonans)
   between them. Fermentation, on the other hand, produced a marked
   degradation of neutral polysaccharides mostly from hemicellulose A (HA),
   hemicellulose B (HB), and alpha-cellulose (CEL), most Likely by
   enzymatic action. Interchange of polysaccharides between these fractions
   may also occur. Conservation did not produce any change in the
   solubility characteristics or in the glycoside composition of the
   different polysaccharides. Texture decreased during the two first steps
   and did not change during the last one (conservation period).}},

Abstract = {{Through a study of cloned nicotinic receptors expressed in Xenopus
   oocytes, we provide evidence that alpha-conotoxin ImI, a peptide marine
   snail toxin that induces seizures in rodents, selectively blocks
   subtypes of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. alpha-Conotoxin ImI
   blocks homomeric alpha 7 nicotinic receptors with the highest apparent
   affinity and homomeric alpha 9 receptors with 8-fold lower affinity.
   This toxin has no effect on receptors composed of alpha 2 beta 2, alpha
   3 beta 2, alpha 4 beta 2, alpha 2 beta 4, alpha 3 beta 4, or alpha 4
   beta 4 subunit combinations. In contrast to alpha-bungarotoxin, which
   has high affinity for alpha 7, alpha 9, and alpha 1 beta 1 gamma delta
   receptors, alpha-conotoxin ImI has low affinity for the muscle nAChR.
   Related Conus peptides, alpha-conotoxins MI and GI, exhibit a distinct
   specificity, strictly targeting the muscle subtype receptor but not
   alpha 7 or alpha 9 receptors. alpha-Conotoxins thus represent selective
   tools for the study of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.}},

   conserved patterns in this class scoring highest according to a
   significance measure defined. Identified patterns may be refined using
   one of two new algorithms. We present a new (nonstatistical)

Abstract = {{Large long-lived eddy currents are induced in a two-dimensional electron
   system as the magnetic field is swept through the almost dissipationless
   states associated with the quantum Hall effect. We have measured the
   temperature dependence of the decay times of these currents in a
   GaAs/AlGaAs single heterojunction, using a torque magnetometer at
   dilution refrigerator temperatures. At Landau-level filing factor nu =
   4, the decay time is less than a minute at T = 40 mK, whereas at nu = 1
   and 2 we observe a decay lime of about 4 hours which follows a short
   initial decay of the order of minutes. We discuss the possible
   mechanisms for decay of the currents and conclude that the energy is
   stored predominantly in the Hall electric field between the edge and the
   centre of the sample. At T = 40 mK we estimate a 2D resistivity of the

Abstract = {{The treatment of Type II diabetes (NIDDM) includes an appropriate diet
   and prudent exercise program. If these measures are insufficient to
   control the blood sugar, oral agents (sulphonylureas or biguanides) or
   insulin are added to the therapeutic regimen. Although the diet
   prescription has undergone some changes and refinements, this approach
   has been the traditional treatment for NIDDM for nearly 40 years.
   Recently a new class of oral agents, the alpha-glucosidase inhibitors,
   has become available. These drugs are competitive inhibitors of the
   alpha-glucosidase enzymes in the brush border of the bowel wall. They
   act to slow and delay the rate of carbohydrate absorption, thereby
   decreasing postprandial hyperglycemia. A recent study was designed to
   evaluate the long-term efficacy of acarbose, an alpha-glucosidase
   inhibitor, in improving the glycemic control of patients with NIDDM who
   were sub-optimally controlled on either diet alone, or diet plus
   sulphonylurea, metformin or insulin. A total of 354 patients with NIDDM
   were studied, 77 on diet alone, 83 on metformin, 103 and sulphonylurea
   and 91 on insulin. Subjects in each treatment stratum were randomized,
   double-blind to either acarbose or placebo, for 1 year. At baseline and
   every 3 months thereafter, fasting and postprandial glucose and
   C-peptide, HbA1c and fasting lipids were measured. Compared to placebo,
   acarbose treatment resulted in a decrease in mean postprandial glucose
   in all four strata (19 +/- 0.8 to 15.3 +/- 0.7 mmol/l: P < 0.001). This
   effect was even more pronounced and highly statistically significantly
   different when comparing the postprandial plasma glucose incremental
   area under the curve between placebo and acarbose treatment. There was a
   decrease in HbA1c of 0.9\% in the diet alone and sulphonylurea groups,
   0.8\% in the metformin group and 0.4\% in the insulin group. This study
   demonstrates that acarbose is effective in improving glycaemic control
   on a long-term basis in patients with NIDDM, independent of concomitant
   anti-diabetic medication. Acarbose does provide a new and effective
   addition to the thereapeutic armamentarium for the treatment of NIDDM.}},

Abstract = {{The PTH/PTHrP receptor belongs to a novel family of G-protein-coupled
   receptors which also includes an insect receptor for a diuretic hormone
   and the protein encoded by a genomic DNA clone from Caenorhabditis
   elegans. Despite significant structural conservation, rat, opossum, and
   human PTH/PTHrP receptor homologs display distinct functional
   characteristics when tested with either {[}Arg(2),
   Tyr(34)]hPTH(1-34)amide or {[}Nle(8,18), Tyr(34)]bPTH(7-34)amide, These
   PTH analogs, and chimeras between rat/opossum and between rat/human
   PTH/PTHrP receptors, led to the identification of receptor residues that
   appear to be involved in ligand/receptor interaction and receptor
   activation, respectively, The search for mutations in the PTH/PTHrP
   receptor gene in genomic DNA of patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism
   type Ib (PHP-Ib) revealed several silent polymorphisms and a missense
   mutation in the receptor's tail region which did not affect receptor
   function, Mutations in the PTH/PTHrP receptor are therefore rarely, if
   at all, responsible for PHP-Ib. A mutation in the PTH/PTHrP receptor is,
   however, the most likely cause of Jansen-type metaphyseal
   chondrodysplasia, a rare form of short-limbed dwarfism which is
   associated with severe hypercalcemia despite normal or low levels of
   circulating PTH and PTHrP, A missense mutation was identified which
   causes constitutive, ligand-independent receptor activation, and thus
   explains the laboratory and the growth-plate abnormalities in affected
   individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Low density lipoprotein (LDL) isolated from human serum of different
   donors was enriched with plasmalogens and their diacyl analogs in order
   to investigate a possible effect of these phospholipids on the rate of
   lipid peroxidation in this lipoprotein. LDL was incubated with either
   vesicles of choline plasmalogen or phosphatidylcholine in presence of
   lipoprotein- deficient serum, or with liposomes of ethanolamine
   plasmalogen or phosphatidylethanolamine together with the non-specific
   phospholipid transfer protein isolated from beef liver. After
   re-isolation of LDL by ultracentrifugation, a dose-dependent
   incorporation of the exogenous phospholipids was obtained. Enrichment of
   LDL with choline plasmalogen resulted in a delay of the copper-catalyzed
   oxidation of LDL from five different donors. LDL from two donors was
   also enriched with diacylglycerophosphocholine which led to a delay of
   oxidation, but the protective effect was smaller than with choline
   plasmalogen. Enrichment of LDL from two additional donors with
   ethanolamine plasmalogen resulted in the strongest protection against
   oxidation, whereas, diacylglycerophosphoethanolamine had little effect.
   The delay of the copper-catalyzed LDL oxidation may be due to a direct
   antioxidative action of the plasmalogens, which are partially degraded
   during the lag phase of oxidation, or to an indirect effect caused by
   alteration of the LDL surface in the presence of an excess of
   glycerophospholipids.}},

   In 3 experiments, infants were familiarized with sets of bisyllables
   that either did or did not share a common consonant-vowel (CV) syllable.
   In Experiment 1, infants detected the presence of a new bisyllable in
   the test phase except when it shared a common initial CV syllable.  A
   modified version of the high-amplitude sucking (HAS) procedure,
   incorporating a 2-min delay period, tested infants' retention of
   information about bisyllables in the remaining 2 experiments.  In
   Experiment 2, infants were significantly more likely to retain
   information about bisyllables that shared the same initial CV syllable. 
   Finally, the authors investigated whether infants simply benefited from
   the presence of 2 common phonetic segments, regardless of whether these
   came from the same CV syllable.  The results showed that CV syllable
   organization is important in infants' ability to encode and retain
   information about bisyllables.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility and
   clinical impact of hepatic venous oxygenation monitoring in patients
   undergoing positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ventilation after
   OLT. The design comprised a prospective study using repeated-measures
   design, within an intensive-care unit for liver-transplanted patients in
   a university hospital. Sixteen consecutive adult patients undergoing
   orthotopic liver transplantation were enrolled. Postoperatively, a
   fiber-optic pulmonary artery catheter was inserted into the right
   hepatic vein. Patients were submitted to controlled ventilation with
   three different levels of end-expiratory pressure (PEEP): 0, 5 and 10
   mbar. Hemodynamics, hepatic venous pressure, mixed venous (SvO(2)) and
   hepatic venous oxygenation (SvhO(2)) were measured. The average time
   required for hepatic venous catheterization was 2.9+/-1.2 min; serious
   complications were not observed. PEEP 5 mbar did not alter hemodynamics
   and SvhO(2); PEEP 10 mbar significantly reduced cardiac index, SvO(2)
   and widened arteriovenous content difference (p<0.05). The mean
   difference between SvO(2) and SvhO(2) was 6.3+/-6.0\% and did not change
   during PEEP ventilation. A significantly positive relationship was
   observed between SvO(2) and SvhO(2) (r=0.91, p<0.05). Hepatic venous
   catheterization appeared to be practical and could be utilized to
   evaluate the effects of therapeutic interventions on the transplanted
   liver. However, the small number of patients studied will not allow the
   assessment of any risk-benefit ratio of the technique investigated. Low
   levels of PEEP provided hemodynamic stability and did not alter hepatic
   oxygen supply-demand ratio. Maintenance of an adequate cardiac index
   during ventilation with higher levels of PEEP appeared to be mandatory
   to insure appropriate oxygen delivery to the liver graft.}},

Abstract = {{It was the aim of our study to investigate whether it might be possible
   to detect non-invasively qualitative changes of bone tissue which occur
   in addition to osteopenia in haemodialysis patients by measuring
   apparent phalangeal ultrasound transmission velocity (APU). Measurement
   of ultrasound transmission velocity in cortical bone in the middle part
   of the midphalanx of the middle finger yields information about elastic
   properties of bone tissue and thus about bone material quality {[}7]. We
   compared 32 patients (20 women, 12 men; 56 +/- 13 years old;
   haemodialysis therapy since 90 +/- 65 months) cross sectionally to age-
   and sex-related controls. As expected osteopenia in the forearm was
   detected by single-photon absorptiometry (SPA): proximal forearm
   (cortical bone) 0.39 +/- 0.11 vs. 0.48 +/- 0.07 g/cm(2), p < 0.0001;
   distal forearm (trabecular bone) 0.29 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.35 +/- 0.08
   g/cm(2), p < 0.005. In a recent study, no significant differences in
   APU-values between osteoporotics (2199 +/- 54 m/s) and age- and
   sex-related controls (2185 +/- 76 m/s) were detected. In contrast, APU
   in haemodialysis patients was significantly lower than in controls: 2151
   +/- 115 m/s vs. 2268 +/- 72 m/s, p < 0.0001. This was even the case in a
   subgroup of 14 patients in which no radiologic symptoms of renal
   osteodystrophia at the skeleton of the hand could be detected: 2181 +/-
   110 m/s vs. 2277 +/- 72 m/s, p < 0.025. All investigated parameters were
   inversely correlated to the duration of haemodialysis: SPA proximal
   forearm r = -0.77, p < 0.001; SPA distal forearm r = -0.57, p < 0.001,
   APU r = -0.52, p < 0.01. Osteoporosis and haemodialysis-associated
   osteodystrophia are both characterized by osteopenia. Opposed to
   osteoporosis, in haemodialysis-associated osteodystrophia qualitative
   changes of bone tissue are common. The deterioration of bone material
   quality in haemodialysis patients leads to lower sound transmission
   velocity in bone which can be detected by decreased values of APU.}},

Abstract = {{The process of solid-state film ion exchange (Ag+-Na+) in glass
   substrates for the fabrication of integrated, optical waveguides has
   been investigated as a solid-state electrochemical process. The ion
   exchange process is initiated by establishing a space-charge
   distribution in the more mobile charge carrier. The space charge
   establishes an intense electric field that drives oxygen to the surface
   to Fuel dopant oxidation and subsequent diffusion. A one-dimensional
   model is presented in space-charge effects in glass having
   charge-blocking and permeable electrodes. The model results show that
   the rate-limiting step for initiating Ag+ diffusion in glass is the
   motion of oxygen ions towards the silver anode to form a layer of silver
   oxide. The predictions of oxygen diffusion time compare favorably with
   the `'dead times'' in the current vs time curves observed during the ion
   exchange process. The dead time corresponds to the period of negligible
   diffusion of silver into glass and formation of a stable oxide layer.
   This was experimentally confirmed by Rutherford backscattering analysis.
   The variation of maximum diffusion current as a function of applied
   voltage and temperature was also studied and a theoretical
   electrochemical treatment is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Sensorineural hearing loss in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been
   reported to be the result of the extraarticular manifestation of the
   disease (rheumatoid nodular vasculitis) or due to drug ototoxicity.
   In an attempt to investigate the presence of sensorineural hearing loss
   and the possible causes for it we investigated prospectively 45 RA
   patients (42 female; three male) with a mean age of 52.5+/-10.7 years
   and a mean disease duration of 8.5+/-7.3 years. All patients underwent a
   complete physical examination and audiological evaluation which included
   pure tone audiometry and impedance audiometry (tympanogram, static
   compliance, acoustic reflex, reflex decay, acoustic reflex latency test.
   We found a sensorineural hearing loss >20 dB HL in 44.4 per cent (40/90)
   ears. In all cases the site of hearing loss was the cochlea and in most
   of them it was bilateral and symmetric (16 patients out of 45 had
   bilateral sensorineural hearing loss i.e. 35.5 per cent.
   There was no correlation between sensorineural hearing loss and age,
   sex, disease duration, articular and extra-articular manifestations and
   the presence of autoantibodies in our patients. In addition, no
   correlation was found between sensorineural hearing loss and drug
   therapy for one at least of the following drugs: NSAIDs,
   D-penicillamine, plaquenil and methotrexate.
   We noticed a prologation of acoustic reflex latency in five patients (10
   per cent) which was found to be correlated with the temporomandibular
   joint involvement and the presence of rheumatoid factor (RF).
   We conclude that inner ear involvement in RA is expressed by: (1) mild
   symmetric, bilateral sensorineural hearing loss of cochlear type in 35.5
   per cent of patients; (2) normal acoustic reflex thresholds; (3)
   nondecay; and (4) prologation of acoustic reflex latency which appeared
   in a small number of patients (10 per cent).}},

Abstract = {{Although CD44 is expressed on a wide variety of cell types, few of them
   use it to recognize the ligand hyaluronan (HA). A
   glycosylation-defective clone of Chinese hamster ovary cells (Lee and)
   bound HA, demonstrating that complete processing of glycoproteins with
   addition of a full complement of sialic acid is not required. On the
   contrary, subsequent findings revealed that complex sugars on CD44 can
   actually inhibit ligand recognition. Two subclones of wild-type Chinese
   hamster ovary cells with similar amounts of surface CD44 were isolated
   on the basis of HA binding and found to differ with respect to CD44 size
   as well as staining with fluorescent lectins. Treatment of the
   nonbinding clone with tunicamycin reduced the size of the protein and
   allowed the cells to recognize HA via CD44. This function was also
   induced by treatment with deglycosylating enzymes (either a mixture of
   endoglycosidase F and N-glycosidase F or neuraminidase alone). A
   possible role for glycosylation in regulation of adhesion was then
   sought with a series of normal and transformed murine cells. Disruption
   of glycosylation or treatment with deglycosylating enzymes did not
   induce ligand binding in an interleukin 7-dependent pre-B cell line, and
   splenic B cells also appeared to be in an inactive state. Some normal B
   cells acquired the ability to recognize HA after stimulation with
   lipopolysaccharide or interleukin 5 and had distinctive surface
   characteristics (loss of immunoglobulin D and acquisition of CD43). An
   additional subset of activated cells might have been in a transitional
   state, because the cells bound ligand after neuraminidase treatment. The
   ligand-binding ability of a purified CD44-immunoglobulin fusion protein
   dramatically increased after neuraminidase treatment. Thus, differential
   glycosylation of this molecule is sufficient to influence its
   recognition function. Cell adhesion involving HA can be regulated by
   multiple mechanisms, one of which involves variable glycosylation of
   CD44.}},

   identification of P. marneffei in clinical materials, we sought to
   develop a specific indirect fluorescent-antibody (IFA) reagent for this
   dimorphic pathogen, Preliminary IFA studies with yeast-like cells
   (fission arthroconidia) of P. marneffei indicated that these cellular
   elements stained with antiglobulins against culture filtrate antigens
   and whole yeast-like cellular antigens, Both types of antiglobulins
   reacted with the yeast-like cells of P. marneffei and with H.
   capsulatum, but not with their respective mycelial forms. The
   antiglobulins also failed to react with the yeast and hyphal forms of a
   variety of other heterologous fungi. Specific antiglobulins useful in an
   IFA test for identifying P. marneffei yeast-like cells in culture or in
   clinical materials were produced by adsorptions with yeast-form cells of
   H, capsulatum, The yeast-like culture filtrate antigens of P, marneffei
   are preferred for use in the production of the specific antiglobulins

Abstract = {{The work functions (phi(+) and phi(e)) effective for thermal
   positive-ionic and electronic emissions from a heated tungsten surface
   were measured as a function of the time (t) elapsing immediately after
   the surface made essentially clean by flashing was adjusted to a working
   temperature (similar to 1800-1500 K). The quantities (Q) of residual
   gases (RG) adsorbed during t were also measured by flash desorption mass
   spectrometry of O+ and CO+ produced by electron impact of desorbed
   gases. Analysis of the data thus obtained yielded the rate expressions
   of Y-n = A(n)-B-n exp {[}-C(n)t], where Y-1-Y-3 are phi(+), phi(e) and
   Q, respectively, and A(n)-C-n are the constants corresponding to
   respective ns. Comparison among the expressions indicates that the work
   function increases (by up to similar to 0.7 eV) generally observed by
   the temperature decrease from similar to 2300 K to 1500 K is caused
   mainly by adsorption of oxygen and/or oxygen compounds included in RG.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper two applications of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in
   nuclear spectroscopy analysis are discussed. In the first application an
   ANN assigns quality coefficients to alpha particle energy spectra. These
   spectra are used to detect plutonium contamination in the work
   environment. The quality coefficients represent the levels of spectral
   degradation caused by miscalibration and foreign matter affecting the
   instruments. A set of spectra was labeled with quality coefficients by
   an expert and used to train the ANN expert system. pur investigation
   shows that the expert knowledge of spectral quality can be transferred
   to an ANN system.
   The second application combines a portable gamma-ray spectrometer with
   an ANN to automatically identify radioactive isotopes in real-time. Two
   neural network paradigms are examined and compared: the linear
   perceptron and the optimal linear associative memory (OLAM). Both
   networks have a linear response and are useful in determining the
   composition of an unknown sample when the spectrum of the unknown is a
   linear superposition of known spectra. One feature of this technique is
   that it uses the whole spectrum in the identification process instead of
   only the individual photo-peaks. This approach has been successfully
   tested with data generated by Monte Carlo simulations and with field
   data from both sodium iodide and germanium detectors.}},

   fistulated oxen with a seven-fold replication for each animal and
   incubation time was conducted for the evaluation of the effect of these
   additives on the dry-matter degradability (DMD). DMD in the incubated
   nylon bags (sample weight 5 g dried silage, bag size 70 x 140 mm, pore
   size 40-45 mu m) was measured after 4, 8, 16, 24, 48 and 72 h rumen

   incubation time were nor measured either for washing losses or for the

Abstract = {{The mechanism by which Xenopus laevis oocytes and eggs survive in
   hypotonic media was investigated by measuring cell volume (V-c) and
   intracellular pressure (P-ic) during osmotic swelling, After 2 hr in 10
   mOsm buffer, eggs remained intact, while 60.2 +/- 7.0\% of oocytes had
   burst. Water uptake was proportional to buffer osmolarity in oocytes,
   but not in eggs, We did not see a regulatory volume decrease in the
   cells, nor was there any evidence for osmolyte efflux. Oocyte P-ic
   increased from 0.27 cm H2O (range 0.14-0.61 cm H2O) to 5.92 cm H2O
   (range 2.52-7.18 cm H2O2, P < 0.001) after 70 min in 20 mOsm buffer, Egg
   P-ic in 20 mOsm buffer (0.04 cm H2O, range -0.07 to 0.014 cm H2O) was
   not significantly different from the value in isotonic (200 mOsm) buffer
   (0.14 cm H2O, range 0-0.16 cm H2O). The data indicate that V-c in
   oocytes and eggs is not regulated by either plasma membrane ion
   transport or the mechanical properties of the vitelline envelope. While
   oocytes appear to behave as passive osmometers, we speculate that the
   ability of eggs to maintain volume is determined, in part, by the
   cytoplasm, in particular by its gel-like nature.}},

Abstract = {{The aging process for spin glasses has been characterized by barrier
   hopping between states of similar magnetization, with the maximum
   barrier height surmounted proportional to the logarithm of the waiting
   time t(w). We investigate the microscopic nature of the decay of the
   irreversible component of the magnetization upon a change in magnetic
   field. In particular, we examine transitions between states with
   magnetizations associated with the initial and final values of the
   magnetic field, and their related barrier heights. We employ a field
   cycling protocol during the waiting time to determine which states
   (barriers) are occupied upon a change of magnetic field. We find that
   the rapid component of magnetization change is associated with
   transitions between states of low barrier heights (we surmise of energy
   less than the change in overall Zeeman energy), and the slow component
   of magnetization change {[}decay of the thermoremanent magnetization
   (TRM)] is associated with diffusion from states at larger barrier
   heights to the `'sink'' associated with the (rapid) small barrier height
   transitions. The transitions between states of differing magnetization
   are limited to transitions between states of similar (small) barrier
   heights. We believe these observations account for the microscopics of
   spin-glass dynamics during the time decay of the TRM.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Constipation is a major problem for patients with chronic
   spinal cord injury (SCI). However, it is not clear whether abnormal
   colonic transit is restricted to the rectosigmoid region or involves the
   entire colon. We assessed regional colonic transit with emphasis on the
   ascending and transverse segments in patients with chronic SCI and
   compared the results with those of controls using scintigraphic
   techniques. Methods: Seven patients with SCI below T1 and 10 control
   subjects were studied after oral ingestion of a capsule containing
   indium-111-labeled Amberlite (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO) pellets.
   The capsule was coated with a pH-sensitive polymer that prevents
   disintegration until it reaches the ileocecal region. Assessments of the
   half-time of emptying and residence time of contents in ascending and
   transverse segments mere made, as well as an assessment of the velocity
   of contents throughout the entire colon, including the descending colon.
   Results: A significantly slower half-time of emptying was found in SCI
   patients ascending: 29 +/- 27 hr in SCI, 6.81 +/- 3.03 hr in controls, p
   < 0.01; ascending + transverse: 42 +/- 12 hr in SCI, 15.3 +/- 7.16 hr in
   controls, p < 0.01). The residence time of the median position of the
   contents was significantly prolonged in SCI patients (ascending: 31 +/-
   23 hr in SCI, 8.75 +/- 4.68 hr in controls, p < 0.05; transverse: 26 +/-
   3 hr in SCI, 5.0 +/- 4.4 hr in controls, p < 0.05). Overall, the
   velocity of the median position of contents throughout the entire colon
   was significantly lower in SCI (0.63 +/- 0.33 cm/hr in SCI, 2.58 +/-
   1.20 cm/hr in controls, p < 0.001. Conclusions: Patients with chronic
   SCI have prolonged colonic transit that involves the entire colon.
   Hence, treatment of constipation in these patients may need to include
   prokinetic agents as well as local rectal maneuvers.}},

Abstract = {{An increase in intracellular biosynthesis of diamine putrescine has been
   known to be related with cell growth whether normal or cancerous (1-4),
   and the genetic expression of ornithine decarboxylase, the putrescine
   synthesizing enzyme, has been found to act as proto-oncogene, critically
   involved in cell transformation (5). In this study, we observed that
   putrescine (Put) exerted its effects on cellular calcium signalling
   similar to human recombinant growth factors (basic-fibroblast growth
   factor, b-rFGF, platelet derived growth factor, rPDGF, hepatocyte growth
   factor, rHGF) and growth promoting-phorbol esters (PMA) in human
   leukemia (K 562) cells. Putrescine and the growth factors diminued
   intracellualr calcium, (Ca2+)i, contents in Fura-2 loaded K 562 cells.
   However, the mechanism of putrescine action on calcium signalling was
   different from that of the growth factors as the b-rFGF and rPDGF (also
   PMA) had additive effects on putrescine-evoked calcium response. In
   order to compare the actions of PMA with DAG (diacylglycerol), we used
   1,2-oleolylacetylgylcerol (GAG), a cell permeable DAG analogue. We
   observed that OAG stimulated the elevations in the intracellular calcium
   contents, an action contrary to that of PMA as observed in this study.
   Pre-treatment of these cells with staurosporine (an inhibitor of the
   protein kinase C, PKC) abolished the effects of the both OAG and PMA,
   indicating that both the agents exert their contradictory effects, in
   part, via PKC activation.}},

Abstract = {{Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is characterized by clinical weakness
   and progressive necrosis of striated muscle as a consequence of
   dystrophin deficiency. While all skeletal muscle groups are thought to
   be affected, enigmatically, the extraocular muscles (EOM) appear
   clinically unaffected. Here we show that dystrophin deficiency does not
   result in myonecrosis or pathologically elevated levels of intracellular
   calcium ({[}Ca2+](i)) in EOM. At variance with a previous report, we
   find no evidence for dystrophin-related protein/utrophin up-regulation
   in EOM. In vitro experiments demonstrate that extraocular muscles are
   inherently more resistant to necrosis caused by pharmacologically
   elevated {[}Ca2+](i) levels when compared with pectoral musculature. We
   believe that EOM are spared in DMD because of their intrinsic ability to
   maintain calcium homeostasis better than other striated muscle groups.
   Our results indicate that modulating levels of {[}Ca2+](i) in muscle may
   be of potential therapeutic use in DMD.}},

   Methods: Adult female rabbits received infusions of 1.7 mg/kg cisplatin,
   10 mg/kg carboplatin, or 6 mg/kg cis-diammine(glycolato)platinum (254-S)
   via the internal iliac artery or jugular vein. The doses were equitoxic.
   Platinum tissue concentration in uterus and platinum serum levels were
   measured after internal iliac arterial or intravenous (TV) infusion with
   these platinum compounds.
   Results: Platinum uterine concentration after intra-arterial infusion
   was significantly higher than that after IV infusion for each drug (P <
   .05). The ratios of platinum uterine concentration after intra-arterial
   infusion to those after IV infusion were 2.24 for cisplatin, 1.83 fbr

Abstract = {{Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is one of the most potent inducers of
   various cytokines and other proinflammatory mediators in macrophages.
   Although pathophysiological consequences of LPS-induced responses are
   well established, the mechanisms through which LPS-generated signals are
   transduced remain unclear. In the present study, we attempted to
   determine early intracellular events after LPS binding which transduced
   the signal for the induction of arachidonic acid metabolism in rat
   alveolar macrophages. While H-7, a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, did
   not affect LPS-stimulated prostaglandin synthesis, staurosporine
   enhanced archidonic acid metabolism in macrophages treated with LPS.
   Phorbol-12-myristate-13 acetate (PMA) significantly inhibited the action
   of LPS. In high glucose media, macrophages were less sensitive to LPS
   compared with control group. PMA and H-7 did not alter the effect of
   glucose. Pertussis toxin did not show any effect, thus pertussis toxin
   sensitive G-protein pathway appears not to play a role in this
   experimental system. Genistein and tyrphostin 25, protein tyrosine
   kinase (PTK) inhibitors, markedly inhibited prostaglandin synthesis in
   macrophages stimulated with LPS. These data suggest the roles of PKC and
   PTK activation in endotoxin signal transduction events leading to
   increased macrophage arachidonic acid metabolism.}},

Abstract = {{The FER gene encodes a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase with a single SH2
   domain and an extensive amino terminus. In order to understand the
   cellular function of the FER kinase, we analyzed the effect of growth
   factor stimulation on the phosphorylation and activity of FER.
   Stimulation of A431 cells and 3T3 fibroblasts with epidermal growth
   factor or platelet-derived growth factor results in the phosphorylation
   of FER and two associated polypeptides. The associated polypeptides were
   shown to be the epidermal growth factor receptor or the platelet-derived
   growth factor receptor and a previously identified target, pp120. Since
   pp120 had previously been shown to interact with components of the
   cadherin-catenin complex, these results implicate FER in the regulation
   of cell-cell interactions. The physical association of FER with pp120
   was found to be constitutive and was mediated by a 400-amino-acid
   sequence in the amino terminus of FER. Analyses of that sequence
   revealed that it has the ability to form coiled coils and that it
   oligomerizes in vitro. The identification of a coiled coil sequence in
   the FER kinase and the demonstration that the sequence mediates
   association with a potential substrate suggest a novel mechanism for
   signal transduction by cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases.}},

Abstract = {{We propose an approximation formula for the stationary distribution of
   the buffer content Q(t) of a fluid model for an ATM multiplexer in which
   the input rate process R(t) is given as a Gaussian process of the form
   R(t) = m + integral(-infinity)(t) h(t - s) dw(s), where w(s) is a
   standard Wiener process. To derive the approximation formula, we
   approximate the behavior of Q(t) by a diffusion process on
   R(-infinity,infinity) having no reflecting barrier. Simulation results
   show that the formula provides good approximate values. The formula is
   similar to the one derived by H. Kobayashi and Q. Ren for multiple
   On-Off types of traffic, but probabilistically it seems more reasonable.
   Our model is fairly general and it covers almost all variable input rate

Abstract = {{Organically coated iron oxide crystallites with diameters of 5-50 nm
   (''nanoparticles'') are potential magnetic resonance imaging contrast
   agents. 1/T-1 and 1/T-2 of solvent water protons are increased
   dramatically by magnetic interactions in the `'outer sphere''
   environment of the nanoparticles; subsequent diffusive mixing
   distributes this relaxation throughout the solvent. Published theory,
   valid for the solute magnetic energy small compared with thermal energy,
   is applicable to small magnetic solutes (e.g,, gadolinium and manganese
   diethylenetriaminopentaacetic acid, and nitroxide free radicals) at
   generally accessible fields (less than or equal to 50 T). It fails for
   nanoparticles at fields above similar to 0.05 T, i.e., at most imaging
   fields. The authors have reformulated outer sphere relaxation theory to
   incorporate progressive magnetic saturation of solute nanoparticles and,
   in addition, indicate how to use empirical magnetization data for
   realistic particles when their magnetic properties are not ideal. It is
   important to handle the effects of rapid thermally induced reorientation
   of the magnetization of the nanoparticles (their `'superparamagnetism'')
   effectively, including their sensitivity to particle size. The
   theoretical results are presented as the magnetic field dependence (NMRD
   profiles) of 1/T-1 and 1/T-2, normalized to Fe content, for three sizes
   of particles, and then compared with the limited data extant for
   well-characterized material.}},

Abstract = {{An unselected group of 487 (222 females, 265 males) patients with
   juvenile onset chronic physical disorders was studied at the age of
   19-25 years for their social outcome and compared with an age-matched
   group of 202 physically healthy controls. The interview covered both
   comprehensive and vocational schooling, data on their employment status,
   relationship to parents and sexual development in detail. The overall
   social maturation index showed poor social maturation in patients more
   often than in the controls. At the time of the study 23\% of the
   patients and 11\% of the controls had no vocational education or were
   not on their way to gaining it. Excluding those with a disability
   pension (10\%), working experience, employment status and unemployment
   were fairly similar in both groups. Sexual development was delayed more
   often in the patients than in the controls and the patients were
   significantly more often unmarried and living in the same household as
   their parents. However, social and psychological factors accumulating in
   excess in the patient group were observed more significant than the
   physical disease to the delayed social maturation.
   Conclusion Among patients with chronic physical disorders there is a
   minor group with delayed social maturation. Those at risk can easily be
   recognized even before adolescence in order to offer them and their
   parents support to achieve reasonable social development in early
   adulthood.}},

Abstract = {{The significance of terrestrial ecosystems to global climate change will
   not be fully recognized until all components which contribute to their
   flux are accurately quantified. The absence of a common approach to
   quantify terrestrial carbon has resulted in substantial discrepancies in
   regional, national, and global estimates of carbon. One of the most
   dramatic cases is represented by the flux estimates for Russian forests
   which differ both in character and by two orders of magnitude. A system
   of accounting which provides a comprehensive estimate of the carbon flux
   between Russian forests and the atmosphere is presented herein. All
   significant components of the carbon cycle in forest ecosystems are
   considered. The sequestration of carbon in Russian forests is
   substantial, In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Russian forests were
   accumulating 0.66 Pg C yr(-1). Approximately one-third of the
   sequestered carbon was returned to the atmosphere through logging and
   forests fires.}},

Abstract = {{Because of the difficulty in isolating the causative organism,
   pericardial tuberculosis is rarely, diagnosed Adenosine deaminase
   activity measured in the pericardial fluid of 108 patients was initially
   of undetermined origin. Subsequently we classified five sources: (1)
   tuberculosis (20 cases); (2) idiopathy (82 cases), (3) neoplasia (three
   cases); (4) purulent bacterial infection (two cases); and (5)
   radiotherapy (one case). The highest mean adenosine deaminase value (126
   +/- 16.68 U. l(-1)) was found in group 1; other values were 29.4 +/-
   8.9, 27 +/- 7.21, 29.5 +/- 13.4, 26 U. l(-1) in the idiopathy neoplasia,
   purulent bacterial infection and radiotherapy groups, respectively.
   There was a statistically significant difference between group 1 and the
   other groups (P less than 0.001), indicating that the adenosine
   deaminase value has 100\% sensitivity and 91\% specificity. In addition,
   there was a positive correlation between high adenosine deaminase values
   and the development of constrictive pericarditis. In this study, two
   patients required pericardectomy. Therefore, the adenosine deaminase
   value is a significant prognostic indicator for the development of
   constrictive pericarditis in tuberculous pericarditis.}},

Abstract = {{The Pseudomonas strain YAYA6 growing on atrazine as carbon source in
   liquid media retained over 50\% of its atrazine degrading activity
   determined in liquid medium after inoculation into a nonsterile soil.
   Evidence is given that the bacteria grow in nonsterile soil using
   atrazine as a substrate. Atrazine was rapidly degraded in inoculated
   soil to concentrations below 0.1 mg/kg, and the results show that
   concentrations below 0.01 mg/kg can be reached. As in liquid medium,
   atrazine was mineralized in inoculated nonsterile soil with liberation
   of (CO2)-C-14 from U-ring-C-14-labeled atrazine. Mineralization
   proceeded to over 60\% when the concentration of atrazine had dropped to
   less than 1\% of its initial concentration. Atrazine biodegradation by
   bacteria of the strain YAYA6 in soil was less efficient at reduced soil
   water contents, under conditions of limited oxygen supply, and in a soil
   with a pH below 7. In a soil with high organic matter content and in a
   soil that had been preincubated with atrazine prior to the addition of
   the bacteria, the lower bioavailability limited the rate of atrazine
   biodegradation by strain YAYA6. The bacteria retained a substantial part
   of their atrazine degrading activity and probably survive during a 6
   week incubation period in nonsterile soils without atrazine.}},

Abstract = {{We describe modifications and improvements to our first report of a new
   nuclear emulsion coating technique for both light and electron
   microscopic autoradiography. Although this technique was originally
   designed to facilitate electron microscopic autoradiography, the
   methodology also allows pre-staining of plastic-embedded tissue sections
   prior to coating the slides with nuclear emulsion for light microscopic
   autoradiography. We now demonstrate that paraffin sections can be
   autoradiographically processed after being subjected to a combination of
   immunocytochemical reactions and special neuroanatomical stains.
   Parlodion film has been found to be more resistant to temperature
   changes and less prone to contamination than Formvar film. The shape of
   the double adhesive tape is an important aspect of the electron
   microscopic technique; it has been modified to minimize contamination
   and facilitate the removal of the grids from the glass slide. These
   technical adjustments facilitate the application of the nuclear emulsion
   and increase radionuclide specificity, thus expanding the investigative
   horizons of light and electron microscopic autoradiography.}},

Abstract = {{The pioneering measurements of galvanomagnetic properties of a boron

   7.10(13) cM(-2)) in weak magnetic fields ranged from 10(-3) to 2 T at
   temperatures between 1.7 and 50 K we carried out. The temperature
   dependence of conductivity was shown to be due to the combined effect of
   weak localization (WL) under spin-orbit interaction and hole-hole
   coupling (HHC) in the diffusion channel. Based on the data on
   temperature dependences of magnetoconductivity and Hall effect, the
   contributions from the WL and HHC effect were separated and their
   typical parameters were determined. The magnetic field dependences that
   are described with a high degree of accuracy by the WL expressions not
   involving the HHC in the diffusion channel were used to obtain absolute
   values and temperature dependence of phase relaxation time of the
   electron wave function tau(phi) proportional to T-1, indicating the
   dominant role of hole-hole interactions in inelastic relaxation at low
   temperatures. Comparison between magnetoresistances in magnetic fields
   perpendicular and parallel to the delta-layer made it possible to
   evaluate the effective thickness of the quasi-two-dimensional hole

Abstract = {{Scaling density profiles of critical O(N)-symmetric systems confined to

   functions. In order to discuss the influence of the boundary conditions
   at the two surfaces of the film on the global shape of the profiles, a
   suitable exponentiation scheme is constructed, Using these exponentiated
   scaling functions as well as results from conformal field theory, the
   shapes of the energy density profiles in d=2,3, and 4 are compared.
   Finally, we discuss the short-distance behavior of the energy density
   profiles close to the surfaces of the film as it follows from the

Abstract = {{In species for which monoclonal antibodies are not yet available, the
   demonstration of Fc receptors has relied on a variety of ligand-based
   assays including the binding of antibody-coated erythrocytes,
   radiolabeled monomeric immunoglobulin, and non-physiologic aggregates of
   immunoglobulin. In order to study the binding of small immune complexes
   to Fe receptors on canine monocytes, a new method was developed using an
   enzyme-linked immune complex. The ability of rabbit polyclonal
   peroxidase:anti-peroxidase (PAP) immune complexes to bind to freshly
   isolated canine peripheral blood monocytes was characterized using
   standard ELISA techniques. The binding of rabbit poly clonal PAP to
   monocytes was time and concentration dependent and reversible. This
   binding was saturable with increasing concentrations of PAP and could be
   blocked by soluble rabbit IgG or rabbit Fc fragments. The blocking and
   saturation curves for canine monocytes were suggestive of multiple
   classes of Fc gamma binding sites. In contrast to intact PAP complexes,
   the binding of F(ab) PAP preparations or free horseradish peroxidase was
   minimal. The use of commercially available PAP preparations provides a
   reproducible, inexpensive, and non-radioactive measure of Fc gamma
   receptor binding on canine cells. In addition, these findings suggest
   caution in using heterologous PAP as a histochemical reagent in tissues
   expressing Fc gamma receptors.}},

Abstract = {{A method is described for the production of somatic embryos of Cyclamen
   persicum Mill. in liquid medium. Five steps are involved; initiation of
   embryogenic cell lines, proliferation of pro-embryogenic masses (PEMs)
   on auxin-containing medium, development of somatic embryos on
   hormone-free medium with high osmolarity, germination and subsequent
   plantlet formation. Cell lines were initiated by culturing the explant,
   the seedling tuber, directly in liquid medium. Three parameters were
   important for obtaining embryogenic cell lines; explant density, hormone
   concentrations and subculture regime. The rate of uptake of the hormones
   2,3-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and kinetin influenced the
   formation of PEMs. Highly embryogenic cell lines were obtained only when
   PEMs had formed within 5-7 weeks. PEMs were proliferated for at least 24
   months and could be isolated from each subculture for the production of
   somatic embryos. A high sucrose content (175 mM) in the development
   medium without hormones ensured efficient embryo development from PEMs.
   A subsequent subculture in low sucrose concentration (58 mM) induced the
   formation of a tuber, thus promoting germination.
   Arabinogalactan-proteins (AGPs) from carrot seeds and AGPs bound by the
   monoclonal antibody ZUM 18 increased the number of PEMs in a culture,
   showing that the activity of AGPs is not species specific.}},

Abstract = {{Male mate choice has received considerable attention in recent years.
   This phenomenon rarely has been demonstrated in anuran mating systems,
   nonetheless, male choice has been suggested as having a significant
   impact on some anuran pairing patterns. Here I present a quantitative
   model that predicts the potential and prevalence of male mate choice in
   nine anuran species with data available in the literature. Males of only
   four of the nine species (Bufo americanus, B. bufo, B. exsul, and Rana
   sylvatica) are predicted to reject females under Normal conditions; in
   those cases only the smallest 1\% to 5\% of the females, respectively,
   should be rejected. By contrast, male Bufo conorus, B, cognatus, Hyla
   rosenbergi, Physalaemus pustulosus, and Rana catesbeiana are not
   expected to reject females of any size. Not until operational sex ratios
   became 1 m: If and search times were reduced to 30\%, on average, of
   normal values will reject and accept strategies become equally
   prevalent. Thus for these nine anuran species, the quantitative model
   presented here elucidates why the extent of male mate choice may be very
   limited, and why it is not expected to exert a strong influence on
   mating dynamics or pairing patterns.}},

Abstract = {{The spatio-temporal expression patterns of mRNA transcripts coding for

   measured in denervated rat soleus muscle and in soleus muscle
   chronically paralyzed for up to 12 d by conduction block of the sciatic
   nerve by tetrodotoxin (TTX). In denervated muscle the AChR alpha-,
   beta-, gamma-, and delta-subunit mRNAs were elevated with highest
   expression levels in the former synaptic and the perisynaptic region and
   with lower levels in the extrasynaptic fiber segments. In muscle
   paralyzed by nerve conduction block the alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and
   delta-subunit mRNA levels increased only in extrasynaptic fiber
   segments. Surprisingly, in the synaptic region the gamma-subunit mRNA
   that specifies the fetal-type AChR, and alpha-, beta-, delta-subunit
   mRNAs were not elevated. The expression of the gene encoding the
   epsilon-subunit, which specifies the adult-type AChR, was always
   restricted to synaptic nuclei. The mRNA for the regulatory factor
   myogenin showed after denervation similar changes as the subunit
   transcripts of the fetal AChR. When the muscle was paralyzed by nerve
   conduction block the increase of myogenin transcripts was also less
   pronounced in synaptic regions compared to extrasynaptic fiber segments.
   The results suggest that in normal soleus muscle a neurotrophic signal
   from the nerve locally down-regulates the expression of fetal-type AChR
   channel in the synaptic and perisynaptic muscle membrane by inhibiting
   the expression of the gamma-subunit gene and that inhibition of the
   myogenin gene expression may contribute to this down-regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Elgodipine is a new second-generation dihydropyridine calcium
   antagonist. Its hemodynamic and antiischemic properties were evaluated
   in a single-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 22 males with chronic
   stable angina. Coronary artery disease was angiographically confirmed.
   Measurements were performed with a Swan-Ganz thermodilution catheter
   during a 30-minute period of rest and before the end of a 4-minute
   bicycle exercise test at maximum individual workload, both with placebo
   (IV infusion of 5 ml saline over 30 minutes) and elgodipine (10 mu
   g/kg/2 min bolus IV, then IV infusion of 1 mu g/kg/min for 28 minutes.
   Elgodipine caused very similar hemodynamic changes at rest and during
   exercise. Its major hemodynamic modification was the marked decrease in
   systemic vascular resistance, which was accompanied by an increase in
   cardiac index and stroke volume. Mean arterial blood pressure was
   slightly reduced, whereas the opposite small increase in heart rate
   meant that the double product remained unchanged. Contrary to resting
   conditions, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, pulmonary artery
   pressures, pulmonary vascular resistance, and mean right atrial pressure
   remained normal or increased to a lesser extent during exercise after
   elgodipine. After elgodipine ischemic ST depression during exercise was
   diminished, and 11 of 16 assessable patients remained free from angina
   pectoris. We conclude that elgodipine is an efficacious antianginal
   drug. Its major mechanism of action is lowering of systemic vascular
   resistance. Thus elgodipine improves systolic car diac function in
   patients with chronic stable angina and may delay the onset of ischemic
   diastolic dysfunction during exercise, as indicated by a normal left
   ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). The data also suggest an
   improvement in coronary blood flow during exercise.}},

Abstract = {{We study deep-inelastic scattering from polarized nuclei within a
   covariant framework. A clear connection is established between
   relativistic and nonrelativistic limits, which enables a rigorous
   derivation of convolution formulas for the spin-dependent nuclear
   structure functions g(1)(A) and g(2)(A) in terms of off-mass-shell
   extrapolations of polarized nucleon structure functions, g(1)(N) and
   g(2)(N). Approximate expressions for g(1,2)(A) are obtained by expanding
   the off-shell g(1,2)(N) about their on-shell limits. As an application
   of the formalism we consider nuclear effects in the deuteron, knowledge
   of which is necessary to obtain accurate information on the
   spin-dependent structure functions of the neutron.}},

Abstract = {{The magnetic properties of nonoriented (NO) electrical steel sheet are
   commonly improved if the texture of their products possesses `'cube
   texture'' (e.g., \{100\} {[}Ovw], `'goss texture'' (i.e,,
   \{110\}{[}011], and less \{222\} texture. Industrially `'cube type'' has
   not been obtained, but `'goss texture'' has been. In a greater or lesser
   degree, \{222\} texture exists. To improve `'goss texture'' and reduce
   \{222\} texture, the grain size of the material prior to cold rolling
   should be larger, When the grain size before cold rolling is larger,
   during primary recrystallization, `'goss texture'' is enriched, \{222\}
   texture is decreased, and the grain grows so easily that higher
   induction and lower core loss can be obtained. This does not depend on
   the presence of phase transformation. In case of NO steel with phase
   transformation, heat treatment before cold rolling has been done below
   the austenite transition temperature (Ac-1) in order to prevent the fine
   grain size caused by alpha --> gamma(+alpha --> alpha transformation. By
   using material that was heated over Ac-1 and cooled with changing
   cooling rates, this study describes (a) the relationship between
   textures before cold rolling and the texture of the final product, and
   (b) the development of the magnetic properties.}},

Abstract = {{The methodologies published earlier for predicting the upper shelf
   energy (USE) of full size Charpy specimens based on subsize test data
   appear to work satisfactorily for either highly ductile materials (USE >

   proposed here that works well for pressure vessel weld materials in both
   unirradiated and irradiated conditions having USE in the intermediate
   region (100 J < USE < 200 J). The methodology uses partitioning of the
   USE into two components, USE(p) and Delta USE (= USE - USE(p)). USE(p)
   is the absorbed energy for a specimen fatigue-precracked to half the
   width. The predicted value of the USE of full-size specimens is a sum of
   two terms. The first term is equal to the product of the normalized
   Delta USE of the subsize specimen and the full-size normalization factor
   for Delta USE. The second term is equal to the product of the normalized
   USE(p) of the subsize specimen and the fracture volume of the full-size
   precracked specimen. The predicted values were within about 10\% of the
   measured values for both unirradiated and irradiated materials.}},

Abstract = {{An uncorrelated collision (modified Enskog) kinetic theory has been

   formulae which have not been evaluated explicitly are integrals over the
   orientational co-ordinates of two interacting molecules. The
   self-diffusion coefficient and shear viscosity formulae derived on the
   basis of this theory agree with those derived recently {[}R.G. Cole and

   Phys. 74 (1991) 775] by a Mori-generalised Langevin method. The volume
   viscosity and thermal conductivity expressions are new. The conductivity
   formula reduces to the Evans result if the effects of translational and
   rotational degrees of freedom are combined instead of being presented
   explicitly as in this work, and to the modified Eucken formula if

Abstract = {{Autotrophic CO2 fixation via the Calvin carbon reduction cycle in
   Alcaligenes eutrophus H16 is genetically determined by two highly
   homologous cbb operons, one of which is located on the chromosome and
   the other on megaplasmid pHG1 of the organism. An activator gene, cbbR,
   lies in divergent orientation only 167 bp upstream of the chromosomal
   operon acid controls the expression of both cbb operons. The two
   5'-terminal genes of the operons, cbbLS, coding for
   ribulose-1,S-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, were sequenced. Mapping
   of the 5' termini of the 2.1-kb cbbLS transcripts by primer extension
   and by nuclease S1 treatment revealed a single transcriptional start
   point at the same relative position for the chromosomal and
   plasmid-borne cbb operons. The derived cbb operon promoter showed
   similarity to sigma(70)-dependent promoters of Escherichia coli. For the
   1.4-kb transcripts of cbbR, the transcriptional start points were
   different in autotrophic and heterotrophic cells. The two corresponding
   cbbR promoters overlapped the cbb operon promoter and also displayed
   similarities to sigma(70)-dependent promoters. The deficient cbbR gene
   located on pHG1 was transcribed as well. A newly constructed double
   operon fusion vector was used to determine the activities of the cbb
   promoters. Fusions with fragments carrying the cbb intergenic control
   regions demonstrated that the cbb operon promoters were strongly
   regulated in response to autotrophic versus heterotrophic growth
   conditions. In contrast, the cbbR promoters displayed low constitutive
   activities. The data suggest that the chromosomal and plasmid-borne cbb
   promoters of A. eutrophus H16 are functionally equivalent despite minor
   structural differences.}},

   reported of-the band gaps of both hexagonal (wurtzite) and cubic thin
   films deposited by a modified molecular-beam-epitaxy process on (001)
   GaAs and GaP substrates. The important difference from conventional MBE
   lies in the method of supplying nitrogen to the growing film. Here a rf
   nitrogen plasma source operating at 13 MHz is used. The structure of the
   films was monitored by x-ray diffraction and controlled by the addition
   of an As beam which results in growth of the cubic form-otherwise films
   grow with the hexagonal structure. The band gaps were measured at room
   temperature by optical reflectivity, as evidenced by the sharp reduction
   in interference oscillations as the photon energy approached the band
   edge, and confirmed by the observation of band-edge photoluminescence.
   The results can be summarized as E(g)=3.42+/-0.02 eV for the hexagonal
   and 3.22+/-0.02 eV for the cubic form. The observation of films
   containing mixed hexagonal and cubic phases, which may have led to
   earlier errors in band-gap measurements, is also reported. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{Caloric restriction causes a generalized decrease in growth rate and has
   been shown to delay the development of both spontaneous and induced
   neoplasia, In contrast to chronic food restriction, the extreme
   condition of fasting/refeeding is associated with an overall increase in
   cell turnover in several organs, including liver, compared with regular
   feeding, The present study was therefore designed to investigate the
   effect of complete food withdrawal followed by refeeding on the growth
   of hepatocyte nodules in initiated rat liver, Male Fischer 344 rats were
   given a single dose of diethylnitrosamine (DEN, 200 mg/kg i.p.) and
   then, starting 1 wk later, they were exposed to one or three cycles of
   fasting (3 days) followed by refeeding (11 days), The control group was
   fed continuously. Seven weeks after DEN administration all rats were
   subjected to the resistant hepatocyte model (2-acetylaminofluorene
   coupled with CCl4) and 2 weeks later 2/3 partial hepatectomy (PH) was
   performed. All animals were killed 2 weeks after surgery. At PH rats
   given one cycle of fasting/refeeding had significantly larger
   glutathione S-transferase 7-7-positive hepatic lesions compared with
   controls (mean area 0.73 +/- 0.04 versus 0.50 +/- 0.05 mm(2), P < 0.025;
   mean percent area 25.6 +/- 3.2 versus 12.4 +/- 0.9, P < 0.005), while no
   significant change was observed in their number, The observed
   differences were more pronounced with three cycles of fasting/refeeding,
   A similar pattern of results was obtained at the time of killing, It is
   concluded that fasting/refeeding can exert a positive effect on the
   growth of rat hepatocyte foci and nodules, in contrast to the general
   inhibitory effect on carcinogenesis caused by food restriction.}},

   individuals in the control group (n = 147) had measurable GSTM1 than MM
   patients (59.1\% vs 42\%, P = 0.002); there was a higher proportion of
   positive phenotypes in general among women than among men. Odds ratio
   analysis indicated that individuals with this polymorphic variant have
   an approximately 2-fold risk of developing these cancers. GSTM1
   phenotype distribution depends on age, smoking habit and tumour

Abstract = {{The construct of illness severity serves many scientific and clinical
   functions. This study tested the performance as severity scales of three
   systems for diagnosing drug dependence - DSM-III, DSM-IV and ICD-10 - in
   a multisite regional sample of 370 clinical subjects. Both lifetime and
   current severity of four drug problems - alcohol, cannabis, cocaine and
   opiate dependence - was studied in three stages: (a) item difficulty and
   internal consistency analysis; (b) probabilistic modeling of
   distribution behavior; and (c) concurrent validation against a set of
   independent measures. All three systems, for most drugs correlated with
   most test variables, had good to excellent concurrent validity.
   Unexpectedly, DSM-III showed in some instances better item behavior,
   composite score behavior and concurrent validity than the other systems,
   though DSM-IV and ICD-10 are based on slimmer generic algorithms, and
   may represent a good balance between simplicity and concurrent validity.
   Results suggest that the design of future diagnostic algorithms start at
   the item level and strive for moderate levels of both internal
   consistency and difficulty. Composite score distributions can then be
   modeled in field research, and necessary item corrections can be made
   before the algorithm is widely promulgated.}},

Abstract = {{The Wrangellia terrane of North America contains a large volume of
   Middle to Late Triassic oceanic flood basalts which were emplaced on top
   of a preexisting island are. Nd-, Sr-, and Pb-isotopic compositions
   reflect derivation from a plume source with epsilon(Nd)(T) similar to +6
   to +7, Sr-87/Si-86 similar to 0.7034, and Pb-206/Pb-204(i) similar to
   19.0. Major and trace element compositions suggest the Wrangellia flood
   basalts (WFB) formed through relatively small degrees of partial melting
   at greater depths than estimated for other oceanic plateaux such as
   Ontong Fava. It appears that the WFB did not form in a rifting
   environment, and that preexisting are lithosphere limited the ascent and
   decompression melting of the source plume. Rocks from the preexisting
   are are strongly depleted in high field strength elements (HFSEs)
   relative to large ion lithophile elements (LILEs), but the WFB are not.
   Assimilation of arc lithospheric mantle or crust was therefore generally
   minor However, some contamination by are components is evident,
   particularly in basalts erupted in the early stages of volcanism. Minor
   isotopic shifts, to lower epsilon(Nd)(T) and Pb-206/Pb-204(i) and higher
   Sr-87/Sr-86(i), are accompanied by shifts in trace element ratios
   towards more arclike signatures, e.g. low Nb/Th and Nb/La. Are
   contamination is greatest in the most evolved basalts, indicating that
   assimilation was coupled with fractional crystallization. A comparison
   of the WFB with other continental and oceanic flood basalts reveals that
   continental flood basalts generally form through smaller degrees of
   melting than oceanic flood basalts and that the contribution of material
   from the crust and lithospheric mantle is significantly greater.}},

Abstract = {{The relative roles of alcohol per se, thiamine deficiency, and liver
   disease in the pathogenesis of alcohol-related brain damage have not
   been fully elucidated. In particular, the extent to which alterations of
   brain thiamine metabolism contribute to cognitive dysfunction in
   alcoholism in the absence of Wernicke's encephalopathy has not been
   established. In the present study, thiamine diphosphate-dependent
   enzymes were measured using standard spectrophotometric techniques in
   homogenates of brain tissue obtained at autopsy from eight alcoholic
   patients, all of whom died in hepatic coma without clinical or
   neuropathological evidence of Wernicke's encephalopathy and six
   nonalcoholic, age-matched controls, matched for autopsy delay time and
   free, at the time of death, from gross malnutrition or other
   neurological or psychiatric disorders. Transketolase activities were
   reduced in cerebellum (by 35\%, p < 0.01), thalamus (by 35\%, p < 0.01),
   frontal cortex (by 22\%, p < 0.01), temporal cortex (by 20\%, p < 0.01),
   and prefrontal cortex (by 19\%, p < 0.01). Activities of the pyruvate
   dehydrogenase complex were selectively reduced in prefrontal cortex by
   25\% (p < 0.01). Activities of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase were
   within normal limits in all brain regions of alcoholic patients. The
   generalized reductions of transketolase activity undoubtedly result from
   thiamine deficiency. Previous studies suggest that the presence of liver
   disease may exacerbate thiamine deficiency in alcoholics. A sustained
   loss of transketolase activity in brain could result in disruption of
   pentose shunt activity and concomitant reductions in reducing
   equivalents and lipid metabolism within the cell. The selective loss of
   pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in prefrontal cortex of alcoholic
   cirrhotics could relate to the phenomenon of hepatic coma. Pyruvate
   dehydrogenase is a rate-limiting enzyme, and loss of activity could
   result in a cerebral energy deficit. Reductions of thiamine
   diphosphate-dependent enzymes could thus be implicated in the
   pathogenesis of alcoholic brain damage in patients in the absence of
   overt Wernicke's encephalopathy.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: To compare the efficacy and tolerability of early evening
   (19.00-21.00 hours) vs, bedtime (22.00-00.00 hours) oral administration
   of roxatidine 150 mg in the short-term treatment of active duodenal
   ulcer.
   Methods: The trial was randomized, double-blind and double-dummy, with
   parallel groups, A total of 276 patients were recruited and randomly
   assigned either to roxatidine in the early evening (n = 139) or
   roxatidine at bedtime (n = 137),
   Results: After 4 weeks, 78\% of patients receiving roxatidine in the
   early evening and 74\% of those treated at bedtime had achieved complete
   healing, as determined by per-protocol analysis. With intention-to-treat
   analysis the healing rates were 70.5\% and 70.8\%, respectively. After 8
   weeks the healing rates in the early evening and bedtime treatment
   groups were 92\% and 95\%(per-protocol analysis) and 78\% and 84\%
   (intention-to-treat analysis). Both treatments proved effective in
   reducing the frequency and severity of daytime and nocturnal epigastric
   pain, as well as other ulcer-related symptoms.
   Conclusions: This study confirmed the healing and analgesic properties
   of roxatidine in duodenal ulcer disease, Early evening or bedtime dosing
   with roxatidine 150 mg resulted in similar 4- to 8-week rates of
   duodenal ulcer healing.}},

Abstract = {{We examined 41 consecutive cirrhotic liver explants from French patients
   for the presence of nodules of adenomatous hyperplasia (AH) and then
   analyzed these lesions, together with underlying cirrhosis (C) and
   associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), for various histological
   parameters, cellular density, and proliferative activity. Thirty-five
   AHs were identified in 10 livers (prevalence, 24\%); seven of 10 were
   HCV positive. Hepatocellular carcinoma was more frequent in patients
   with AH than in patients without. The AHs consisted of 17 ordinary (OAH)
   and 18 atypical (AAH) adenomatous hyperplasia lesions. There was a
   malignant focus in five of the 18 AAHs. Wide areas of large liver cell
   dysplasia were frequent in OAH but never found in AAH. Obvious steatosis
   was frequent in HCC but excep tional in AAH and absent in OAH. There was
   a significant increase in cellular density in AAH and HCC as compared
   with C and OAH. Proliferative cell nuclear antigen immunostaining
   similarly showed an increase in proliferation from OAH or C to AAH and
   HCC. These data suggest that, in Europe as in Japan, one pathway of
   hepatocarcinogenesis is a multistep process in which AAH should be
   considered as a premalignant lesion very close to grade I HCC, while OAH
   seems to correspond to a regenerative nodule with limited proliferative
   ability. Copyright (C) 1995 by W.B. Saunders Company.}},

   understanding of the behaviour of a given algorithm, and to support the
   debugging of that software. To illustrate the use of this package we
   analyse its facilities in connection with a parallel implementation of
   block Gaussian elimination to solve a system of equations which arises
   when a certain spectral method is employed to solve an elliptic partial
   differential equation in two dimensions. We outline the method, indicate
   the synchronisation mechanisms which are necessary to ensure that the
   correct sequence of operations take place, and briefly describe the
   facilities provided by Encore Parallel Fortran which support these
   mechanisms. We then examine the facilities of the visualisation software
   and indicate how these were adapted to monitor accesses to a packed
   storage representation of a block sparse array. Finally we illustrate
   the use of the software in the context of the solution of a particular
   partial differential equation.}},

Abstract = {{The toxicity of the mixotrophic chrysophyte Poterioochromonas
   malhamensis to the common cladoceran Daphnia ambigua was investigated
   with laboratory survivorship experiments and observations of feeding
   behavior. When cultured autotrophically in an inorganic medium, P.
   malhamensis provided sufficient nutrition for survival and reproduction
   by D. ambigua. However, P. malhamensis grown heterotrophically on an
   organic medium (osmotrophically) in the dark or light was toxic to D.
   ambigua, killing all experimental animals within five days. Toxicity was
   not caused by the organic medium since daphnids fed the autotroph
   Chlamydomonas reinhardi that was grown in the organic medium had high
   survivorship. Changes in feeding behavior supported the results from the
   survival studies. Daphnids feeding in suspensions of heterotrophically
   cultured P. malhamensis exhibited significantly greater food rejection
   rates than animals fed autotrophically cultured P. malhamensis or C.
   reinhardi. Differences in the growth rate or biochemical pathways of
   heterotrophically versus autotrophically grown P. malhamensis likely
   influenced toxin production. Poterioochromonas may affect zooplankton
   feeding and behavior in nature if heterotrophic toxin production is
   comparable between phagotrophic acid osmotrophic nutritional modes.}},

   randomized,double-blind,placebo-controlled crossover trial. A total of
   24 patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease and
   exercise-induced ST segment depression underwent 144 investigations (6
   in each patient) at the first placebo treatment, ist and 8th day during
   treatment with the first drug and the second placebo treatment, 1st and
   8th day during treatment with the second drug. A wall motion score (sum
   of 14 segments; wall motion grading: normal = 1, hypokinetic = 2,
   akinetic = 3, dyskinetic = 4) and ST depression at the exercise were
   used to assess the anti-ischemic effects. Both drugs reduced the number
   of exercise-induced wall motion abnormalities on the maximal comparable
   exercise level in comparison to placebo treatment. The wall motion score
   on the maximal comparable exercise level during placebo treatment was
   25.5 +/- 6.9, during isosorbide dinitrate treatment (1 day) 23.5 +/- 7.2

Abstract = {{We have proposed recently that a pertussistoxin-insensitive Ca2+ influx
   stimulated by Y-2-type receptor activation in CHP-234 human
   neuroblastoma cells underlies increases in intracellular free Ca2+
   concentration ({[}Ca2+](i)) induced by neuropeptide Y (NPY), which were
   strictly dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and independent of internal
   Ca2+ stores. We describe here the actions of NPY in these same cells,
   using the activity of Ca2+-activated K+ channels as an indicator of
   {[}Ca2+](i). The elementary slope conductance of these channels was 110
   +/- 3 pS (with an asymmetrical K+ gradient), their activity was greatly
   increased by application of ionomycin, and they were reversibly blocked
   by 1 mM tetraethylammonium (TEA) and 100 nM charybdotoxin. Application
   of 100 nM NPY, in the presence but not in the absence of extracellular
   Ca2+ increased the channel open probability. ATP applied in the absence
   of external Ca2+ caused rises both in chan nel open probability and
   {[}Ca2+](i). Inositol trisphosphate production was stimulated by ATP but
   not by NPY. In outside-out patches, NPY increased channel open
   probability, indicating that NPY-associated Ca2+ influx does not require
   all the intracellular machinery present in intact cells. Channel
   activation by NPY was unaffected by the replacement of guanosine
   5'-triphosphate (GTP) by (guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP{[}beta
   S]), a non-hydrolysable GDP analogue, in the pipette internal solution,
   consistent with the lack of involvement of G-proteins in the coupling of
   Y-2-type receptors to Ca2+ influx in CHP-234 cells.}},

Abstract = {{Candida albicans and Torulopsis glabrata are the most prevalent yeasts
   in humans. The majority harbor C. albicans in the oral cavity, but only
   a few develop oral candidiasis. We have sought a possible relationship
   between indigenous salivary constituents, including antimicrobial and
   nutritive factors, and the growth rate and/or viability of inoculated
   fungi in glucose-supplemented sterilized saliva. Stimulated whole saliva
   was collected from 30 healthy donors. Saliva samples were sterilized,
   supplemented with glucose and inoculated with C. albicans or T.
   glabrata. After incubation of the inoculates for 20 h, the number of
   viable cells were counted. All saliva samples were analyzed for
   different indigenous salivary components and Candida before as well as
   after sterilization. Besides a 4\% reduction in calcium (Ca2+) and
   thiocyanate (SCN-) concentrations, sterilization did not affect the
   concentrations of saliva electrolytes, but the proteins were
   significantly reduced (19-85\%). Indigenous candidal carriage (n=19)
   correlated with neither the growth of inoculated fungi nor any of the
   analyzed components in saliva. The growth of C. albicans and T. glabrata
   was similar at pH 5 but, at pH 6, C. albicans had a remarkably slower
   growth rate than T. glabrata. Statistical analysis showed that the 5-h
   growth of C. albicans at pH 5 was associated with water and electrolyte
   secretion, whereas the growth after 20 h was associated with variations
   in protein-glycoprotein content. The growth of T. glabrata was not
   related to variations in the salivary variables analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{The extensive open marine marshes on Florida's Gulf of Mexico coast
   constitute one of the largest continuous coastal marsh systems in the
   U.S.A. and are characterized by (1) the absence of an apparent modem or
   relict sediment supply, (2) a thin 1-2 m sediment veneer overlying
   highly karstified bedrock and (3) both low wave and low tidal energy
   regimes. More importantly, the Florida open marine marsh system appears
   to be keeping pace with current rates of sea-level rise in spite of a
   limited inorganic sediment supply and low tidal energies. Although the
   magnitudes and directions of suspended solid transport and the processes
   controlling these transports have been rigorously documented for other
   U.S.A. marsh systems, they have not been documented in the Florida marsh
   system. Total suspended solid (TSS) concentrations, current speeds and
   water levels were monitored in Cedar Creek, Florida, so that the TSS
   loads could be calculated and the processes exerting control over
   material exchange could be determined. Both TSS concentration and load
   are modulated by spring/neap variations and time-velocity asymmetries in
   the tidal currents. Concentrations at the creek mouth increase by as
   much as two orders of magnitude during strong wind events due to the
   presence of waves; however, large net sediment loads appear to be
   related to the coupled effects of waves and large tidal prisms. Waves
   initially mobilize sediments in the adjacent embayment but increased
   tidal prisms, and the associated higher velocities, are requisite for
   transport of this material further into the creek. Large tidal prisms
   may be the result of astronomically high tides or meteorologically
   forced tides. In Cedar Creek, the most important meteorological events
   affecting sedimentary processes are extra-tropical storms. This is
   because they occur at much higher frequencies than tropical storms and
   hurricanes, even though the latter are more potent and potentially could
   transport greater amounts of material. This study identifies the
   important processes controlling suspended solid transport in the broad
   expanses of Juncus roemerianus dominated marsh adjacent to the large
   arcuate embayments prevalent along the west-central Florida marsh coast
   as described by Hine and Belknap (1988). The processes exerting control
   over sediment transport in the Cedar Creek drainage basin are similar to
   those documented in other marsh systems. (C) 1995 Academic Press Limited}},

Abstract = {{A 12 week feeding trial utilizing four inclusion levels of a low
   alpha-galactoside soy protein concentrate was conducted with 224
   Dekalb-XL chicken laying hens, seven hens per cage, eight cages per
   dietary treatment. Soy protein concentrate ranged from 0 to 18.65\% of
   the diets. Soybean meal was used to make the diets iso-nitrogenous.
   Diets with the highest levels of soy protein concentrate resulted in
   significantly lower feed consumption and egg weights. No significant
   differences were observed in shell quality parameters.
   A 6 week feeding trial was conducted with 240 Arbor Acre X Ross
   1-day-old male broiler chicks, eight chicks per cage, six cages per
   dietary treatment. The four diets differed in the ratio of soybean meal
   and low alpha-galactoside soy protein concentrate used to provide
   protein, with soy protein concentrate ranging from 0 to 25.9\% of the
   diets. The diets were formulated to be iso-nitrogenous and
   iso-energetic. Diets containing the highest amounts of soy protein
   concentrate resulted in significantly reduced feed consumption and
   weight gain. Feed conversion was not significantly affected.
   Protein utilization studies were also conducted with 2- or 3-week-old
   male broiler chicks to compare the protein efficiency ratio of soybean
   meal, ethanol extracted soybean meal, and soy protein concentrates with
   five chicks per cage, six cages per protein source treatment. Chicks
   were given the test diets for a 2 week period. Feed consumption and body
   weights were recorded to compare protein efficiency ratios (PER) of the
   different protein sources. Ethanol extracted soybean meal resulted in
   greater protein utilization and amino acid availability than soybean
   meal. It was speculated that the soy protein concentrates required
   further heat treatment and methionine supplementation in order to obtain
   optimal protein utilization by chickens.}},

Abstract = {{A GaAs MESFET model is presented that addresses the modeling problem
   arising from the discrepancy between the derivatives of the de current
   and the measured small signal parameters of a GaAs MESFET. This
   discrepancy traditionally required the user of a non-linear circuit
   analysis program such as SPICE to trade off the accuracy between the de
   analysis and ac analysis. This paper addresses this problem and leads to
   a solution that completely eliminates the need for such a trade off. Two
   additional nodes are incorporated into the SPICE MESFET model by
   providing two extra conducting paths necessary to reconcile the
   aforementioned discrepancies and to keep the equations self-consistent.
   In addition, the model allows the user to select different sets of model
   parameters to independently match I-ds, g(m), and g(ds). An integration
   scheme to transform the new model back to a 3 x 3 Y-matrix is employed
   to accelerate the simulation speed.}},

Abstract = {{J.C. Wakefield(1992a, 1992b, 1993) recently proposed that mental
   disorder is best conceptualized as a `'harmful dysfunction,'' whereby
   `'harm'' is a value judgment regarding the undesirability of a
   condition, and `'dysfunction'' is the failure of a system to function as
   designed by natural selection. The authors maintain, however, that (a)
   many mental functions are not direct evolutionary adaptations, but
   rather adaptively neutral by-products of adaptations, (b) Wakefield's
   concept of the evolutionarily designed response neglects the fact that
   natural selection almost invariably results in substantial variability
   across individuals, and (c) many consensual disorders represent
   evolutionarily adaptive reactions to danger or loss. The authors propose
   that mental disorder is a Roschian concept characterized by
   instrinsically fuzzy boundaries and that Wakefield's analysis may only
   prolong scientific debate on a fundamentally nonscientific issue.}},

Abstract = {{Electric stimulation of the posterior parts of the spinal cord (dorsal
   column stimulation), a direct clinical offspring of the `gate-control
   theory' presented 30 years ago, came into use as a means of relieving
   intractable pain only a few years later. The method was spread rapidly
   in the US and in Europe and is today an important adjunct in the therapy
   of selected pain syndromes resistant to other forms of treatment.
   Especially pain due to nerve injury, pain in peripheral vascular disease
   as well as angina pectoris are conditions which often respond to this
   treatment modality. Application of electric current to the dorsal
   columns evokes both ortho- and antidromic activity, the former being the
   base for the paraesthesiae experienced by the patient during
   stimulation. DCS seems to selectively suppress neurogenic types of pain,
   but the method also has a profound influence on pain in ischemia,
   probably via an entirely different mechanism. The somato-sensory and
   autonomic modulatory properties of DCS are the subject of this review,
   and in discussing this, we will also touch upon the question of the
   mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects. Furthermore, we will try
   to reflect the problems of generalizing observations from the
   laboratory, when DCS procedures are applied to subhuman subjects without
   concurrant disease, to the clinical setting and the suffering patient.}},

Abstract = {{This article focuses on bacteriophage P4 as a potential peptide display
   phage by exploring the possibility of using the P4 capsid decoration
   component, Psu, as a peptide carrier protein. Psu is non-essential for
   P4 growth but it enhances the stability of the P4 capsid by binding to
   its exterior. We have constructed a unique SacI cloning site in the
   beginning of the psu gene. This site changes the third amino acid of Psu
   from Ser to Leu. This substitution does not destroy the binding of Psu
   to the P4 capsid. A synthetic oligonucleotide encoding a 10-amino acid
   peptide whose sequence is part of the human p62(c-myc) protein, has been
   inserted into the SacI site. The Psu(c-myc) shows full capsid binding
   activity and reacts with monoclonal antibodies directed against the
   c-myc peptide. These results pave the way for the further development of
   a peptide display system based on bacteriophage P4.}},

Abstract = {{The impingement flowfield in a ducted combustor with one axial inlet and
   dual side inlets was characterized qualitatively by smoke flow
   visualization as well as quantitatively by laser Doppler velocimetry and
   microphone measured velocity and wall pressure spectral characteristics,
   respectively, The baseline momentum ratio MR of the axial inlet to side
   inlets was chosen to be 0.27. In this case, a resonant feedback
   frequency of 365 Hz, which prevailed in the entire combustor, and the
   second and the third harmonics, which appeared near the impingement
   region, were observed, The effect of MR on the flow oscillations was
   further studied, and the results showed that a constant Strouhal number,
   based on the axial inlet velocity and width, of 0.013 was found for MR
   less than or equal to 0.94, and Reynolds number of 10(3)-10(4) and the
   frequency of the oscillations varied linearly with the MR, From the
   investigation of the measured spectra, the feedback mechanism with
   appropriately proposed feedback distance and convective velocity, and of
   the chamber resonance curve, the onset of the oscillations was
   interpreted to be triggered by the coupling between the disturbance
   feedback frequency and the acoustic frequency of the chamber.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) frequently
   cause damage to the gastroduodenal mucosa, principally by suppressing
   mucosal prostaglandin synthesis. However, such acute mucosal injury
   usually resolves, despite continued NSAID administration, by a process
   known as adaptation. Newer NSAIDs, such as etodolac, have been developed
   to minimize effects on prostaglandin synthesis,
   Aim: To determine whether etodolac causes less acute damage than
   naproxen, and whether the damage produced resolves with continued NSAID
   administration.
   Methods: Twenty-four healthy volunteers were given a 28-day course of
   either etodolac 300 mg b,d, or naproxen 500 mg b,d, Gastroduodenal
   damage was assessed using a modified Lanza scoring system and mucosal
   blood flow with laser doppler flowmetry at endoscopy before NSAID
   administration and during days 1, 7 and 28 of continued intake.
   Results: Maximum gastric damage (median grade and interquartile range,
   IQR) occurred during the first 24 h of administration, being greater
   with naproxen (2.0, IQR 1.0-3.0) than etodolac (1.0, IQR 1.0-1.5; P =
   0.03). Such damage was associated with a fall in antral blood now in the
   naproxen group (mean +/- S.E.M.) from 54.5 +/- 3.4 to 43.8 +/- 3.4
   arbitrary units (P = 0.07) and a slight increase in mucosal blood flow
   in the etodolac group from 43.5 +/- 2.24 to 49.5 +/- 3.6 arbitrary
   units. With continued intake this damage resolved in all subjects taking
   etodolac and in eight of 14 subjects on naproxen. Resolution in the
   naproxen group was associated with a return to normal of antral blood
   flow.
   Conclusions: These observations suggest that etodolac causes less
   mucosal damage than naproxen and that adaptation occurs to both.}},

   provided from age 6 up to and including age 18. The study determined at
   what age, at which lesion depth and in which surfaces restorative
   treatment was performed, Furthermore, the conditions of nonrestored
   dentin lesions were evaluated over time. Nearly 50\% of the restorations
   were placed in the mesial surface of the first molars. In both groups
   more than 2/3 of the restorations were placed in surfaces with dentin
   lesions. In the group with the highest caries prevalence 50\% of the
   lesions in the outer half of the dentin were restored when first
   detected in contrast to 20\% in the groups with the lower prevalence.
   For the superficial dentin lesions not immediately restored, average
   time between their detection and restoration, the end of the study or,
   detection in the inner half of the dentin was practically the same in
   both groups (19.3 and 20.4 months). The variation in this average time
   was only to a limited degree explained by the variation in the caries

Abstract = {{Progesterone profiles were monitored in goats housed in single (n = 9)

   cycles (n = 97) were less than or equal to 30 days. Extended cycles (n =
   45) were > 30 days and except for one cycle with a persistent corpus
   luteum, had periovulatory periods of 10 to 20 days (n = 29) or averaging
   65.1 days in length (n = 15), mostly characterised by recurrent oestrus
   and/or occasional transient rises in progesterone.
   The proportion of normal cycles occurring in winter was 87.5\% (28/32)
   and 77.7\% (42/54) for goats in single and group pens respectively,
   falling to 62.5\% (15/24) and 37.5\% (12/32) respectively in spring. The
   distribution of normal vs extended cycles according to season was
   significant (P < 0.05, single; P < 0.001 group pens). Goats housed
   communally experienced a greater fall in the percentage of normal cycles
   in spring, possibly due to increased stress associated with group
   feeding. Within each season, however, housing per se did not influence
   the distribution of normal vs extended cycles.
   For normal cycles, Harvey's Analysis of Variance showed that season was
   significantly associated with length of the periovulatory period (3.99
   days (JJA) vs 5.79 days (SON), P < 0.001), oestrus detection rate (87\%
   (JJA) vs 55\% (SON); P < 0.01) and oestrus duration (1.94 clays (JJA) vs
   1.13 days (SON); P < 0.05). In contrast, luteal phase length was not
   affected by season, but was significantly associated with housing (16.93
   days (single pens) vs 18.32 days (group pens), P < 0.01). The reduction
   in ovarian activity observed in spring may reflect a seasonal reduction
   infertility, possibly linked with increasing temperature and
   photoperiod.}},

Abstract = {{The function of a bioprosthetic heart valve is determined largely by the
   material properties of the valve cusps. The mechanics of natural and
   bioprosthetic valve cusps have been studied extensively using uniaxial
   tensile testing. This type of testing, however, does not duplicate the
   natural biaxial loading condition. Whole-valve biaxial testing therefore
   is preferred. The objective of the present study was to investigate the
   heterogeneity of the valve cusps by mapping out the regional variability
   of the biaxial strain versus pressure relationship. Whole porcine aortic
   valves were mounted horizontally, submerged in physiologic saline
   solution at 37 degrees C, and pressurized in the range of 0 to 130 mm Hg
   of pressure. The ventricular side of the cusps were marked with black
   dots and the three-dimensional position of these dots was recorded
   together with the aortic pressure. By calculating the distance between
   the dots in the radial and circumferential directions in different
   regions, the local strain versus pressure relationship was determined.
   The results showed that the valve cusp material strained by 23\% +/-
   0.8\% in the radial direction and 10.0\% +/-0.5\% in the circumferential
   direction before lock-up. It was also found that while the valve cusp
   was highly anisotropic in the central region, the basal region was
   relatively isotropic, and the cusp as a whole was asymmetrical in its
   distensibility.}},

Abstract = {{We present a study of viscous overstabilities that can arise in a narrow
   ring whose particles are tightly packed, so that the pressure tenser
   exhibits a behavior different than that in a more dilute ring. The main
   objective of this work is to investigate the role of viscous
   overstabilities in the excitation of(azimuthal) eccentric modes in
   narrow rings. The problem is studied through an analytical study of a
   2-streamline model and supported by a 10-streamline numerical
   simulation.
   There are two possible regimes of instabilities, one in which the mean
   eccentricity of the ring (i.e., of its azimuthal mode) decreases to a
   small but finite and nearly constant value, while internal modes of
   libration reach comparable amplitudes (''small eccentricity regime''),
   and the other one in which the mean eccentricity of the ring increases
   to a much larger asymptotic value (''large eccentricity regime'') while
   internal librations are strongly reduced, but not fully damped. This is
   to be contrasted with the behavior of viscously stable rings, in which
   both the librations and the mean eccentricity are fully damped, if one
   neglects the role of the shepherd satellites. Whether one or the other
   of these regimes is obtained depends on the initial conditions, but the
   final state in each regime is controlled by the viscous and
   self-gravitational evolution and not by these initial conditions. In
   both regimes, there is no rotating frame in which the ring looks
   stationary, in opposition to the assumption made in data analyses and in
   previous theoretical modeling.
   The large eccentricity regime is generically able to produce rings with
   stabilized mean eccentricities and mean eccentricity gradients quite
   similar to those of the eccentric rings of Uranus; however, this regime
   cannot be reached from an initially circular state, so that if viscous
   overstabilities alone are to account for the eccentricity of narrow
   rings, then the ring material must have been in eccentric motion at the
   time of formation. The residual librations in the large eccentricity
   regime may explain the problems of the standard self-gravity model for
   the rigid precession for the epsilon ring, but this appears much more
   difficult to accomplish for the alpha and beta rings; these residual
   librations may account for some of the kinematic residuals of the
   uranian rings, and may also relate to the absence of width-longitude
   relation in the smaller eccentric rings. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

   biological activity of medium conditioned by incubated neurohypophyses
   in specific bioassays for PRL and for the 16 kDa N-terminal fragment of
   PRL (16K PRL). Neurohypophyseal conditioned medium (NHCM) obtained after
   incubating neurohypophyseal robes (1 h at 37 degrees C) was enriched
   with proteins of 14 kDa and 23 kDa, that crossreacted with PRL- and 16K
   PRL-directed antisera. The NHCM stimulated in a dose-dependent fashion
   the proliferation of Nb2-lymphoma PRL-dependent cells. This effect
   paralleled that of PRL and 16K PRL standards and was neutralized by
   different dilutions of both PRL- and 16K PRL-antisera. Also, the NHCM
   inhibited the proliferation of endothelial cells in culture, an
   antiangiogenic-effect exerted by 16K PRL. The antiangiogenic effect of
   the NHCM was parallel to that of 16K PRL standard and neutralized by 16K
   PRL antiserum in a dose-dependent fashion. These results indicate that
   NHCM contains proteins that share receptor activation properties as well
   as antigenic determinants with both PRL and 16K PRL.}},

   accumulation.
   The effect of the fungal isolates on the uptake of the immobile metals
   Zn and Cu differed between the two soils:
   In the soil `'Kleinlinden'' mycorrhizal colonization increased heavy
   metal uptake by up to 37\%. In the highly contaminated soil `'Munchen'',
   mycorrhizal infection lead to a higher uptake (max. 59\%) in roots but
   to a reduced translocation to the aerial plant fractions. The higher
   uptake of Zn and Cu into the roots was related to the higher heavy metal
   concentrations in this soil.
   The Cd uptake showed no difference between the two soils, but was
   increased in the roots by VAM together with a lower translocation into
   the shoots.
   VAM-formation changed the root architecture by increasing the specific
   root length (m g(-1) root dry matter) and the total root length (km per
   pot).
   This increased absorbing surface of the roots was a major, but not the
   only cause for the differences in heavy metal uptake.}},

Abstract = {{Analyses of receiver functions recorded at two broadband seismic
   stations in the northern Cordillera indicate that the crust is thinner
   beneath Dawson (similar to 35 km) than Whitehorse (similar to 39 km). A
   simple two-dimensional gravity model, constrained by the seismic
   results, shows that this change in crustal thickness occurs at about 63
   degrees N, in a zone approximately 35 km wide, where the Moho dips at
   similar to 8 degrees to the south. The Bouguer anomaly high associated
   with the thinner crust can be traced westward into east-central Alaska
   where crustal thinning and extension are well documented; therefore we
   propose that west-central Yukon (north of 63 degrees N) has been
   extended also. On the basis of geological and other geophysical data we
   examine three likely time windows, in the Cretaceous, early Tertiary,
   and Present. We discuss data which indicate that early Tertiary and
   younger extension may be related to the transfer of motion from the
   Denali Fault System inboard to the Tintina Fault System. Earlier
   Cretaceous extension has been variously attributed to collision related
   back are extension, syncollisional processes, or gravitational collapse
   of an overthickened crustal section. The relative importance of
   extension in these periods remains nebulus; however, the correspondence
   between the transition in crustal thickness determined in this study and
   a mapped boundary between `'lower'' plate and `'upper'' plate rocks
   suggests mid-Cretaceous extension exerted a significant influence on
   current Moho depths.}},

Abstract = {{The lasing characteristics and dynamic properties of partly gain-coupled
   1.55-mu m DFB lasers with a gain corrugation in the strained-layer MQW
   active region are presented. Narrow spectral linewidth, which is
   associated with the low linewidth enhancement factor, was experimentally
   measured. By analyzing data from RIN measurements, the damping rate, the
   damping factor, the intrinsic bandwidth and the effective differential
   gain were obtained, From the small-signal frequency response, a measured
   -3 dB bandwidth of 22 GHz at 10 mW output power was achieved, The high
   bandwidth is believed to be related to the high differential gain,
   resulting from the combination of longitudinal gain- and index-coupling
   mechanisms and the reduction of the carrier transport time, which is due
   to an efficient lateral carrier injection along the longitudinal
   interface, Experimental results show that under 10 Gbit/s pseudorandom
   NRZ modulation, the devices have small wavelength chirp and clear eye
   openings making them suitable for long haul and high bit-rate
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Contact between machine components can involve normal, sliding and
   rolling motion, either singly or in combination. Combined normal and
   sliding motion, which occur for example in the meshing of gear teeth and
   in heavily-loaded rolling elements, can present problems for
   lubrication. The purpose of the present experimental study was to
   investigate how surface roughness affects the lubricant film
   characteristics under conditions of combined normal and sliding motion.
   The experimental arrangement consisted of a rotating roller which
   impacted a stationary ball in the presence of a lubricant. Under the
   same conditions of normal surface approach, increasing the surface
   roughness significantly decreased the level of roller sliding that could
   occur without breakdown of the lubricating film. This behaviour was
   similar to a step function. Of the several surface roughness parameters
   investigated, only those which involved the maximum peak-to-valley
   height correlated well with experimental results. In general, surface
   roughness had a greater effect on oil film breakdown than did either
   viscosity or load.}},

Abstract = {{We compute the electromagnetic mass differences of mesons containing a
   single heavy quark in terms of measurable data using QCD-based arguments
   in heavy-quark effective theory. We derive an unsubtracted dispersion
   relation that shows that the mass differences are calculable in terms of
   the properties of lowest-lying physical intermediate states. We then
   consider the problem in the large-N limit, where N is the number of QCD
   colors. In this limit, we can write a kind of double-dispersion relation
   for the amplitude required to determine the electromagnetic mass
   difference. We use this to derive analogues of the Weinberg sum rules
   for heavy-meson matrix elements valid to leading order in 1/N and to
   Q(1/m(Q)) in the heavy-quark expansion. In order to obtain our final
   result, we assume that the electromagnetic mass differences and sum
   rules are dominated by the lowest-lying states in analogy with the
   situation for the pi(+)-pi(0) mass difference. Despite the fact that
   some of the matrix elements appearing in our final result have not yet
   been accurately measured, we can obtain useful estimates of the
   electromagnetic mass differences: for example, we obtain (M(B+) -
   M(B0))(EM) similar or equal to +1.8 MeV. We argue that our results are
   accurate to about 30\%.}},

Abstract = {{We have studied the expression of lamins A and C (A-type lamins) in a
   lung carcinoma cell line using type-specific monoclonal antibodies,
   Using immunofluorescence and immunoblotting studies it was noted that
   several irregularities in lamin expression exist in the cell line
   GLC-A1, derived from an adenocarcinoma, First, the expression of the
   A-type lamins was lower than in other adenocarcinoma cell lines of the
   lung. Also the ratio between lamins A and C proteins was 1:8 instead of
   the 1:1 ratio seen in the other cell lines, Northern blotting con firmed
   the altered level of A-type lamin expression. Secondly, an abnormal
   localization of lamin A was observed, Intensely fluorescing lamin A
   aggregates were observed in the nucleus, rather than the typical
   perinuclear staining pattern, Confocal scanning laser microscopy
   revealed that the lamin A aggregates were indeed present throughout the
   internal nucleus, When these cells were extracted with Triton X-100 the
   nucleoplasmic aggregates disappeared, which indicates that the A-type
   lamins are not properly incorporated into the lamina. The A-type lamins
   in other cell lines derived from adenocarcinomas remained present in the
   nuclear periphery after extraction with the non-ionic detergent,
   Immunoblotting studies of the Triton X-100 soluble and insoluble
   fractions showed that lamin A and an apparently truncated product, which
   was detected with the lamin A antibody, were present in the insoluble
   fraction of GLC-A1. This truncated product is partly Triton X-100
   soluble since it was also detected in the detergent soluble fraction,
   Thirdly, using an antibody to A-type lamins sporadic GLC-A1 cells showed
   a filamentous cytoplasmic staining pattern, which was Triton X-100
   resistant, Double labeling immunofluorescence studies revealed that
   these cytoplasmic lamins colocalized with the vimentin cytoskeleton in
   this cell line.}},

Abstract = {{Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) responses remain intact or increase
   after chronic or repeated stress despite robust levels of circulating
   glucocorticoids that would be expected to restrain the responsiveness of
   the axis. The purpose of this study was to determine whether chronic
   stress altered corticosteroid receptor messenger RNA (mRNA) levels at
   any locus known to mediate glucocorticoid feedback on HPA function (i.e.
   hippocampus or hypothalamus), whether such effects were glucocorticoid
   dependent, and whether changes in corticosteroid receptor function could
   potentially contribute to the putative shift from
   corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) to arginine vasopressin (AVP) in
   the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) in the modulation of
   pituitary adrenal function occur ring during chronic stress. We compared
   the stress responsiveness of sham-operated rats to that of
   adrenalectomized rats using a moderate dose of corticosterone (CORT)
   pellet replacement (ADX + CORT group). Acute immobilization caused a
   significant increase in CRH, but not AVP, mRNA levels in the
   parvocellular PVN in sham rats. The ADX + CORT group showed
   significantly greater increases in both CRH and AVP mRNA levels in the
   PVN compared to sham rats. These data indicate that PVN AVP mRNA levels
   are more sensitive to glucocorticoid negative feedback than are the
   levels of CRH mRNA. In repeated stress, the sham groups showed robust
   increases in PVN CRH and AVP mRNA levels despite high levels of plasma
   CORT. The rise in AVP mRNA levels was greater than that in CRH mRNA.
   Type II glucocorticoid receptor mRNA in the hippocampus and PVN was
   decreased in the repeatedly stressed sham group. These data suggest a
   decrease in the CORT negative feedback restraint of PVN CRH and AVP mRNA
   levels after repeated stress and a persistence of relatively greater
   responsiveness of AVP mRNA levels to CORT negative feedback. After
   repeated stress in ADX + CORT rats, both PVN CRH and AVP mRNA levels
   showed robust responses, with a relatively greater increase in AVP mRNA.
   These data indicate that a CORT-mediated decrease in hippocampal and
   hypothalamic glucocorticoid receptor mRNA levels is not the only

Abstract = {{Differential gene expression at the transcriptional level was examined
   as an initial step in the investigation of the P-i starvation response
   of Brassica nigra suspension cells. Total RNA was extracted from 7-day
   old cells grown in media containing either no P-i, 1.25 mM or 10 mM P-i.
   In vitro translation was carried out using their respective poly(A)(+)
   RNA isolates and the resultant polypeptides were separated on a
   high-resolution SDS-PAGE gel. Scanning densitometry identified four
   polypeptides (ca. 31.7, 32.3, 52.5 and 64.8 kDa) present only in the
   P-i-starved samples.
   Screening by differential hybridization was performed on a cDNA library
   constructed from mRNA isolated from P-i-starved cells. Probes prepared
   from mRNA. from P-i-defficient and P-i-sufficient cells identified a
   number of clones representing mRNA species that were preferentially
   transcribed under P-i deficiency. These phosphate starvation-responsive
   (psr) clones were placed into eleven groups as determined by
   cross-hybridization. Northern blots showed that the corresponding genes
   are inducible in both mild and severe P-i starvation conditions.
   Preliminary sequencing identified one of the clones as being homologous
   to beta-glucosidases from several plant species. The possible role of
   beta-glucosidase during P-i starvation and the identities of the other
   psr genes are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments with sand-cement models show that reverse reactivation of a
   set of parallel faults bounding domino blocks takes place in two
   principal modes. In (Mode I) reactivation, the domino blocks undergo
   counter-rotation during contraction while normal faults are reactivated
   as reverse faults. Mode II reactivation occurs by fault-block
   translation. We present a theoretical analysis of the two modes which
   considers forces and their rotational moments in a domino block and show
   that low-angle normal faults are commonly reactivated in Mode II. By
   contrast, steep faults are reactivated in Mode I. Furthermore, fault
   reactivation depends on the initial fault spacing. A large initial fault
   spacing opposes fault reactivation, especially in Mode I. Instead, the
   system deforms along new thrusts, dipping opposite to the normal faults.
   We generate reactivation parameters for the conditions of the two modes
   as functions of the ratio (R) between fault spacing and effective
   thickness of fault horizon, the fault dip (Theta), the coefficient of
   friction (mu) and the ratio of principal stresses (Sr) during late
   contraction.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: To determine whether, in a susceptible population, dosing with 10
   mg famotidine 1 h before an evening meal could decrease the interference
   with sleep caused by heartburn,
   Methods: Patients with a history of frequent heartburn (n = 309) were
   randomized to receive 10 mg famotidine or placebo 1 h before an evening
   meal likely to induce symptoms, Patients assessed the efficacy of the
   treatment in preventing heartburn after the meal, at bedtime and during
   the night, The number of awakenings due to heartburn and the consumption
   of antacid tablets taken to alleviate symptoms were also recorded.
   Results: Treatment groups were well matched and data from 302 patients
   were available for analysis, Compared to placebo, famotidine treated
   patients had: less heartburn after the meal (P < 0.0001 mean global
   scores), less interference with getting to sleep (P = 0.0156 mean global
   scores), fewer awakenings (P = 0.0001 difference in mean number) and
   better control of heartburn during the night (P < 0.0001 mean global
   scores). They were also almost three times less likely to need antacid
   treatment than the placebo group during the night (relative odds for no
   antacid 2.78 (95\% CI: 1.29-5.96), Only four patients in each group
   suffered adverse events,
   Conclusion: Taking a 10 mg dose of famotidine 1 h before an evening meal
   appears to be a successful and well tolerated strategy for preventing
   post-prandial heartburn and avoiding the associated interference with

Abstract = {{It has been established during the past few years that interleukin(s)-1,
   -6, -11 (IL-I, IL-6, IL-11), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can
   stimulate osteoclast development and thereby the process of bone
   resorption, Moreover, upregulation of the production and/or action of
   IL-6 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of disease states
   characterized by excessive osteoclastic bone resorption, including the
   osteopenias associated with loss of either ovarian or testicular
   function, This article highlights this evidence and attempts to clarify
   the role of cytokines in the bone loss associated with gonadal
   deficiency, Specifically, it reviews data demonstrating that the
   protective effects of estrogens and androgens on the skeleton are
   mediated through their ability to inhibit IL-6 production, Both of these
   steroids exert their effects by inhibiting the transcriptional activity
   of the IL-6 gene promoter via mechanisms involving their respective
   specific receptors, Upon loss of gonadal function in either sex, there
   occurs an upregulation of osteoclast formation which is mediated by
   IL-6, Consistent with this, IL-6 deficient mice do not exhibit an
   increase in the formation of osteoclasts after ovariectomy or
   orchidectomy, and are protected from the bone loss caused by the loss of
   gonadal function in either sex, Even though these observations establish
   that IL-6 is an essential pathogenetic factor in the bone loss caused by
   gonadal deficiency, it remains unclear whether IL-6 is the sole
   pathogenetic factor or whether IL-1, TNF, and IL-11 may also be
   involved, However, in contrast to IL-6, these cytokines do not seem to
   be directly regulated by sex steroids, Therefore, it is unlikely that
   they are causative factors in the pathogenesis of this condition; yet,
   because they are required for osteoclast development, they may be
   participatory factors in the bone loss caused by gonadal deficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Surgery for the correction of vesicoureteral reflux has been performed
   routinely since the early 1960s. In 1986 a large group of women who
   underwent childhood ureteral reimplantation surgery was contacted and
   surveyed concerning infections, pregnancies and other complications. A
   notably high rate of cystitis and pyelonephritis was found during
   pregnancy. Because 9 years have passed and many more pregnancies have
   occurred, we contacted this cohort again as well as a new cohort of
   historical controls to reassess long-term complications of childhood
   ureteral reimplantation in children.
   Of 67 women who underwent reimplantation with an average followup of 25
   years 62 were contacted of whom 75\% had urinary tract infections after
   becoming sexually active and 65\% had urinary tract infections with
   pregnancies. Of 141 pregnancies 57 (40\%) were complicated by urinary
   tract infections and 21 (15\%) terminated in spontaneous abortion. Of 37
   women with primary vesicoureteral reflux and no surgery with an average
   followup of 25.5 years there was a 15\% prevalence of urinary tract
   infections with pregnancy in 21. Of 75 pregnancies in this group 14
   (18\%) terminated in spontaneous abortion.
   Women with urinary tract infections and reflux as children have high
   rates of cystitis with the onset of sexual activity whether or not they
   underwent reimplantation as children. Those who underwent reimplantation
   as children are at significant risk of urinary tract infection in
   pregnancy but not at a higher risk of miscarriage than the general
   population. Education, screening and antibiotic prophylaxis during
   pregnancy should be considered.}},

Abstract = {{It is known that a continuous family of compact self-adjoint operators
   can be diagonalized pointwise. One can consider this fact as a
   possibility of diagonalization of the compact operators on Hilbert
   modules over a commutative W{*}-algebra. The aim of the present paper is
   to generalize this fact to a finite W{*}-algebra A not necessarily
   commutative. We prove that for a compact operator K acting on the right
   Hilbert A-module H-A{*} dual to H-A under slight restrictions one can
   find a set of `'eigenvectors'' x(i) is an element of H-A{*} and a
   non-increasing sequence of `'eigenvalues'' lambda(i) is an element of A
   such that K x(i) = x(i) lambda(i) and the selfdual Hilbert A-module
   generated by these `'eigenvectors'' is the whole H-A{*}. As an
   application we consider the `'Schrodinger operator in a magnetic field
   with irrational magnetic flow as an operator acting on a Hilbert module
   over the irrational rotation algebra A(theta) and discuss the
   possibility of its diagonalization.}},

   high-risk multiple myeloma (MM), Inclusion criteria were: age less than
   65 years and high-risk MM defined as stage II rc IM, stage III MM,
   refractory or relapsed MM. The design of the study was: 1) HDCYC +/-
   hematopoietic growth factors followed by PBPC collection, and 2)
   high-dose melphalan combined with total body irradiation (or busulfan
   for previously irradiated patients) followed by PBPC reinfusion (ABPCT),
   All 60 patients completed the procedure except two who died from
   infection after HDCYC and another of acute cardiac failure after
   reinfusion of PBPC, Out of the 60 evaluable patients, three failed to
   respond while the other 57 achieved either a partial (n = 33) or
   complete (n = 24) response, Thirty-one patients progressed or relapsed
   after a median duration of response of 15 months (range: 3-43), The
   median follow-up for the other 26 responder patients was 24 months
   (range: 2-66), Twenty-one patients died, 18 of MM (2 after failure, 16
   after relapse) and three responders of lung cancer in = 1) and infection

Abstract = {{Thiouracil and a few related drugs are known to be melanoma-seeking
   agents owing to specific incorporation into nascent melanin. The
   melanin-affinic properties are apparently due to binding to
   intermediates, preferably dopaquinone, produced in the melanin synthetic
   pathway by tyrosinase-catalysed oxidation of tyrosine.
   In the present paper, in vitro screening methods have been used for the
   identification of possible melanoma seekers according to the above
   principle. The binding of test substance to dopaquinone suppresses
   dopachrome formation by the withdrawal of dopaquinone from the reaction
   mixture, and the decrease in dopachrome concentration was monitored
   spectrophotometrically at 475 nm. In order to eliminate false results
   caused by tyrosinase inhibition, which also will decrease the dopachrome
   concentration, the oxygen consumption was followed potentiometrically.
   To avoid the effect of tyrosinase inhibition on dopachrome formation,
   additional experiments with autoxidation of L-dopa in the presence of
   test substance were performed. Of the 22 substances (mainly
   thioureylenes and thioamides) studied,
   4,5,6-triamino-2(H)-pyrimidinehtionsulfate, trithiocyanuric acid,
   2-thiouracil, 6-methyl-2-thiouracil, and 4-amino-2-mercaptopyrimidine
   most effectively decreased the dopachrome formation with no or little
   inhibition of tyrosinase activity. They should therefore be regarded as
   potential melanoma seekers. In a complementary autoradiographic study on
   the uptake of the potent tyrosinase inhibitor mercaptobenzothiazole
   (MBT) in B 16 melanoma, transplanted to mice, it was found that strong
   tyrosinase inhibition seems to decrease incorporation into melanin in
   vivo. MBT was partly accumulated in restricted areas of the tumor, which
   may be explained by the small molar dose injected.}},

Abstract = {{Diabetes-prone NOD mice of both sexes and at different ages were
   compared to control mice with regard to the level of pancreatic
   expression of certain autoantigens: antigens for islet cell antibodies
   (ICA antigens) and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 67 kDa. ICA
   antigens were compared by immunofluorescence using serial dilutions of
   ICA positive human sera so that differences of fluorescence intensity
   were due only to differences in amounts of antigen. Pancreatic GAD67
   mRNAs were compared by polymerase chain reaction followed by Southern
   hybridization with P-32-probes and densitometry of autoradiographic
   bands. GAD67 product and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were compared by
   immunoperoxydase staining.
   As compared to BALB/c, C57BL6, Swiss, or F-1 mice, NOD mice displayed
   higher ICA antigen levels (P<0.01) both before and after insulitis onset
   (at 7 days, 15 days, 1 month, 2 months). ICA antigens were scarcely
   detectable by the first day of life, and increased with age from 7 days
   to 2 months (P<0.01; n=10 for each strain and at each age). Both before
   and after insulitis onset (4 days, 7 days, 15 days, 1 month, 2 months),
   amounts of GAD67 mRNAs were higher (P<0.01) in NOD mice than in BALB/c
   mice (n=8 for each age in each strain). This was already noted in
   foetuses on Day 18 of gestation (n=8). After birth, amounts of GAD67
   mRNAs increased up to 1 month (P<0.04) and then decreased in older mice.
   The staining intensity of pancreatic sections with antisera against
   either GAD67 or GABA was higher (P<0.04) in islets from NOD mice than in
   those from control mice. Whatever the age, no significant difference was
   noted between female and male NOD mice with regard to ICA antigens or
   GAD67. The expression of ICA antigens and GAD67 was intermediate in NOD
   x BALB/c F-1 mice when compared to parental strains.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study of an evacuated-tube, integral-collector-storage
   water heater was conducted in an indoor solar simulator. Useful
   collected energy, radiation-induced stratification and draw-induced
   mixing are characterized in eight trials in which test duration, initial
   tank water temperature, flow rate during withdrawal of heated water from
   the collector, withdrawal pattern and reflectance of the backplane were
   varied. All tests were performed at nominal irradiance of 900 W/m(2),
   normal incidence, and collector slope of 45 degrees. The capability of
   the TRNSYS integral collector storage model to predict performance for
   operating conditions for which data are assumed to be unavailable was
   assessed. Using data from one experimental trial, optical efficiency
   (tau alpha) of the collector was determined by matching predicted useful
   energy gain to measured gain. Effectiveness of the calibrated model was
   based on a comparison of predicted gains to measured values obtained in
   the remaining seven trials. For five of seven trials, predicted
   performance is within nine percent of measured performance and less than
   experimental error. For the other two trials, predicted performance is
   within 15 percent of measured performance. The higher discrepancies may
   be partially due to experimental conditions nor modeled such as heating
   of the piping connecting the collector to the test facility and
   inadequate characterization of back-plane reflectivity. The model does
   not predict radiation-induced stratification Although the effect of
   mixing during draws can be approximated by specifying the number of
   fully mixed volume segments in the tanks, selection of number of nodes
   requires knowledge of the behavior of the system. The number of nodes
   selected has minimal impact on total energy gain, but does affect the
   temperature of water delivered to the load.}},

Abstract = {{To identify key molecules that regulate germ cell proliferation and
   differentiation, we have attempted to isolate protein kinase genes
   preferentially expressed in germ line cells. One such cDNA cloned from
   murine embryonic germ(EG) cells encodes a nonreceptor type
   serine/threonine kinase and is predominantly expressed in the testis,
   ovary, and spleen of adult mouse. The nucleotide sequence of the entire
   coding region shows that this clone, designated Plk1(polo like kinase
   1), is identical with STPK13 previously cloned from murine
   erythroleukemia cells. The protein encoded by Plk1 is closely related to
   the product of Drosophila polo that plays a role in mitosis and meiosis.
   To define the role of Plk1 in germ cell development, we have examined
   its expression in murine gonads by in situ hybridization. Here we show
   that the Plk1 gene is specifically expressed in spermatocytes of
   diplotene and diakinesis stage, in secondary spermatocytes, and in round
   spermatids in testes. It is also expressed in growing oocytes and
   ovulated eggs. The pattern of expression of the Plk1 gene suggests that
   the gene product is involved in completion of meiotic division, and like
   the Drosophila polo protein, is a maternal factor active in embryos at
   the early cleavage stage. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Electrophysiological studies using rats anesthetized with chloral
   hydrate were performed to elucidate whether or not intravenously
   injected talipexole acted as a D-2 receptor agonist on the striatal
   neurons in comparison with the action of bromocriptine. The activities
   of the striatal neurons were extracellularly recorded using a glass
   microelectrode attached along a seven-barreled micropipette, each barrel
   of which was filled with talipexole, bromocriptine, SCH23390 (D-1
   antagonist), domperidone (D-2 antagonist), glutamate or 2 M NaCl. These
   drugs were iontophoretically applied to the immediate vicinity of the
   target neuron being recorded. The effects of talipexole and
   bromocriptine were examined on the neurons, whose spikes (induced by the
   stimulation of the substantia nigra pars compacta) were inhibited by the
   iontophoretic application of domperidone. Iontophoretic application of
   talipexole or bromocriptine increased spontaneous firing of these
   neurons and this increase in firing was also inhibited by
   iontophoretically applied domperidone. In the same neurons,
   intravenously administered talipexole (0.01, 0.02 and 0.04 mg/kg)
   dose-dependently increased firing, and this increase was inhibited by
   microiontophoretically applied domperidone, but not by SCH23390. On the
   other hand, the intravenous injection of bromocriptine (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4
   mg/kg) also increased the firing rate. However, the increase was not
   dose-dependent and fluctuated; the firing transiently decreased during
   the increase in firing with intravenously administered bromocriptine.
   However, the bromocriptine-induced increase in firing was also
   suppressed by domperidone, and decrease in firing was inhibited by
   SCH23390. These findings suggest that talipexole acts as a D-2 agonist
   on the striatal neurons receiving input from substantia nigra pars
   compacta and increases firing when intravenously applied. However,
   intravenously administered bromocriptine appears to act as both a D-2
   agonist and probably as a D-1 agonist on the striatal neurons to
   increase and decrease firing, respectively.}},

   administration for determination of heparin concentration, LPL activity,
   and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). The disposition of
   heparin was dose dependent. The area under the plasma heparin
   concentration vs time curve (AUG) increased more than proportionally
   with dose, indicating that heparin elimination was nonlinear. Total
   clearance of heparin was similar after the 40 and 80 IU/kg of body
   weight dosages, averaging 0.45 and 0.36 IU/kg/min, respectively.
   However, after administration of the 120 IU/kg dose, clearance was
   significantly less than that after the 40 IU/kg dose. The half-life of
   heparin averaged 53, 70, and 136 minutes after 40, 80, and 120 IU/kg,
   respectively, with significant differences observed between the low and
   high doses. In contrast to heparin, the area under the plasma
   concentration vs time curve for LPL activity increased less than
   proportionally with dose. Maximal LPL activity observed was independent
   of dose, averaging 4.8 mu mol of free fatty acids/ml/h. The APPT was
   significantly prolonged for 120 minutes after administration of the 40
   IU/kg dose. Correlation coefficients for LPL activity vs either plasma
   heparin concentration or APTT were less than 0.7, indicating that
   neither laboratory measure can be used to accurately predict plasma LPL

Abstract = {{Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells divide by medial fission. One class of
   cell division mutants (cdc), the late septation mutants, defines four
   genes: cdc3, cdc4, cdc8, and cdc12 (Nurse, P., P. Thuriaux, and K.
   Nasmyth. 1976. Mol. \& Gen. Genet. 146:167-178). We have cloned and
   characterized the cdc4 gene and show that the predicted gene product,
   Cdc4p, is a 141-amino acid polypeptide that is similar in sequence to
   EF-hand proteins including myosin light chains, calmodulin, and troponin
   C. Two temperature-sensitive lethal alleles, cdc4-8 and cdc4-31,
   accumulate multiple nuclei and multiple improper F-actin rings and septa
   but fail to complete cytokinesis. Deletion of cdc4 also results in a
   lethal terminal phenotype characterized by multinucleate, elongated
   cells that fail to complete cytokinesis. Sequence comparisons suggest
   that Cdc4p may be a member of a new class of EF-hand proteins. Cdc4p
   localizes to a ringlike structure in the medial region of cells
   undergoing cytokinesis. Thus, Cdc4p appears to be an essential component
   of the F-actin contractile ring. We find that Cdc4 protein forms a
   complex with a 200-kD protein which can be cross-linked to UTP, a
   property common to myosin heavy chains. Together these results suggest
   that Cdc4p may be a novel myosin light chain.}},

Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Fertilisation of ascidian eggs induces the rapid release of a cell
   surface N-acetylglycosaminidase that blocks sperm binding to vitelline
   coat sperm receptors resulting in a block to polyspermy. Fertilisation
   also triggers a large contraction of the egg (thus stimulating ooplasmic
   segregation) that is completed within 5 min of insemination. In eggs of
   the ascidian Phallusia mammillata, glycosidase release and cortical
   contractions are blocked by BAPTA-AM
   {[}bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid,
   tetra(acetoxymethyl)-ester], a cell-permeant calcium chelator,
   indicating that both processes are probably dependent on a rise in
   intracellular calcium levels. Both glycosidase release and the cortical
   contraction are induced by treatment of the egg with the protein
   synthesis inhibitor emetine, while only the glycosidase release is
   induced by isoproterenol, carbachol or acetylcholine. Previous work with
   ryanodine demonstrated that ryanodine also caused glycosidase release
   but not the cortical contraction. Inversely, activation by ionomycin in
   calcium-free sea water causes cortical contractions but not glycosidase
   release. Thus the two processes can be activated independently.
   Dextran-coupled (10 kDa) calcium green-1 injected eggs show an increase
   in intracellular calcium 30-40 s before the cortical contraction is
   triggered by fertilisation or ionomycin-induced activation. This
   confirms previous findings that the cortical contraction is a
   consequence of the activation calcium wave triggered by the sperm. The
   extracellular calcium requirement for the glycosidase release suggests
   that calcium influx may be more important for this phase of egg
   activation. Thus activation of ascidian eggs appears to involve two
   independent pathways involving calcium.}},

Abstract = {{Characteristics of the travel paths of white-footed mice (Peromyscus
   leucopus) were examined by tracking animals marked with fluorescent
   pigment in a wooded site in northeastern Kansas. Based on 84 trails made
   by 49 individuals, it was concluded that tops of structural features
   (rocks, branches, logs, or rock fence) were selectively used for
   nighttime travel. Trails averaged 41.7\% structural features (SE =
   6.0\%), whereas sample points 20 cm away from trails averaged 18.0\%
   structural features (SE = 1.8\%). This pattern of use of structural
   features did not differ between male and female mice. Nighttime
   illumination (according to the moon phase) and season did not affect the
   proportion of structural features used along travel paths; this suggests
   that risk from visual predators was not driving the pattern of use of
   structural features for travel paths by white-footed mice. Rather,
   white-footed mice may have used surface structure for travel because
   structural features provide paths that are more easily traveled and
   remembered. Trees were climbed infrequently (0.6 trees per 100 m of
   trail), but more in autumn (1.9 trees per 100 m of trail) than in other
   seasons (0.2 trees per 100 m of trail), which likely resulted from
   greater availability of seeds, nuts, and fruits during autumn than
   during other seasons.}},

Abstract = {{Effective primary prevention strategies are currently available for only

   is probably most useful for cancers wherein the stage at diagnosis is
   clearly related to curability. Early detection by screening has been
   shown to lead to a better outcome following the treatment of cancers of
   the breast, cervix, and colon, Screening for cancer also enables
   preneoplastic states to be detected and treated, Screening programs
   offer an opportunity to enhance the potential of chemoprevention. New
   cancer screening tests will soon be developed, including some that will
   detect known genetic predispositions to cancer. Each new screening test
   must be critically evaluated in rigorous studies before being embraced

   efficacy must be demonstrated as judged by improved survival of those

   is a modification of the catalytic batch method previously reported by
   Hirayama and Unohara. By optimising the chemistry for FIA and
   incorporating in-line preconcentration of the iron from seawater onto a
   column of resin-immobilised 8-hydroxyquinoline, the detection limit of
   the method has been reduced to 0.025 nM. The typical precision of the
   method for a 0.35 nM Fe sample is 2.5\% (n = 6). The method has been
   used at sea in its preconcentration mode to determine iron in open ocean
   water samples from the equatorial Pacific and the North Atlantic. It has
   also been used in a direct injection mode for hydrothermal plume samples
   from around Loihi Seamount in the Central Pacific.}},

Abstract = {{Steady-state boundary layer flow generated on a rotating fluid-saturated

   employing an appropriate boundary condition to account for the presence
   of tangential slip in the radial and transverse directions on the
   permeable interface which separates the boundary layer from the Darcy
   flow occurring in the porous bed. Two important physical parameters
   which influence the dynamic coupling between these two flows are
   rotation and permeability of the porous bed. An interesting result of
   this study is that to each value of rotation parameter s, there
   corresponds a permeability value K-o for which the velocity component
   normal to the bed and the radial shear stress vanish at every point on
   the bed; that is, under certain conditions the radial shear stress can
   be completely annihilated and the porous bed made to behave as if it

Abstract = {{Future opportunities for gigascale integration (GSI) will be governed by

   limits on interconnects at all levels of this hierarchy are elucidated
   by plotting the square of reciprocal length of the interconnect versus
   the response time of the interconnect circuit. Fundamental and material
   limits are defined essentially by the time of flight of a lossless
   transmission line. The response time of a canonical distributed
   resistance-capacitance network imposes the principal device limit, while
   the dominant circuit limit is imposed by the response time of a

   that the protonation process of a given phosphate group is complex and

   phosphates interact Less than two trans phosphates. The influence of the
   presence of Kf on the microconstants determined in medium 2 can be

Abstract = {{This paper analyses the optimal monetary policy of a government facing
   an election, whose disinflationary `abilities' are uncertain, under the

   can choose to `do nothing' on the inflation front in order to avoid
   risking electoral defeat should disinflation prove too costly. The costs
   of inflation reduction are worth bearing if initial inflation is
   sufficiently high: therefore it is possible to observe quick
   disinflations that however stop short of low inflation.}},

Abstract = {{Since the mid-19th century settled livestock ranching has been the major
   form of land use in South Africa, occupying 68\% of the land surface.
   Decreases in livestock densities and ranch numbers during the past
   century imply that carrying capacities for domestic herbivores are
   falling. Differences in carbon isotope signals with soil depth and
   abrupt shifts in dominant plant species across ranch boundaries reveal
   that southern African rangelands are changing. Case studies suggest ways
   to control altered grassland composition, bush encroachment in arid
   savanna, and dominance by toxic and halophytic shrubs in arid
   shrublands. But climatic and biological factors constrain rates of
   passive recovery, and guidelines for active restoration are poor and
   techniques costly. Moreover, conservation of remaining good rangeland is
   seldom enforced, and economic considerations usually outweigh the land
   user's desire to sustain diversity and productivity.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology have had
   a great impact on the delectability of minute, asymptomatic lesions of
   the central nervous system. The clinical significance and treatment
   modes of these lesions, such as white matter hyperintensity (WMH)
   lesions detected by T2 MRI, remain controversial. To address these
   problems, we retrospectively evaluated WMH lesions in relation to
   clinical parameters for 240 neurologically asymptomatic persons who had
   visited a hospital for a medical check-up of the brain. Proton and
   T2-weighted MRI were obtained using a 0.5 T superconducting MR imager
   using the spin echo technique with a repetition time (TR) of 2800 msec.
   An echo delay times (TE) of 40 msec was used for the proton MRI, and a
   TE of 100 msec was used for the T2-weighted MRI. The images were
   visually analyzed according to a four-point grading system. The MRI
   findings were correlated with clinical parameters including age, gender,
   presenting symptoms, and hypertension. The overall frequency of WMH
   increased with age. Grades 2 and 3 of WMH were more frequent in aged
   persons, whereas the occurrence of grade 1 WMH remained relatively
   constant across age groups. Based on multiple regression analysis, age
   was the most significant variable influencing the frequency of WMH,
   followed by hypertension. These results imply that WMH lesions may
   simply be a phenomenon of aging, or may be an indicator of prepathologic
   state in an ischemic brain.}},

Abstract = {{We revisited 68 plots of forest vegetation in the San Bernardino
   Mountains that had been quantitatively described in 1929-1935 from the
   California Vegetation Type Map (VTM) Survey. By using the same sampling
   methods, we documented changes-over approximately 60 years and during a
   period of fire suppression management-in tree density by both species
   and size class. In general we found increasing stand densities, a
   transformation from old-growth age structure to young growth, and a
   compositional shift from Pinus ponderosa and P. jeffreyi to Abies
   concolor and Calocedrus decurrens. Density of trees of more than 12 cm
   diameter at breast height (dbb) increased by 79\%, including three to
   ten-fold increases in the youngest cohorts 12-66 cm dbh. The magnitude
   of change depended upon initial forest composition and local annual
   precipitation. Monotypic stands of P. jeffreyi or those initially
   dominated by Abies concolor showed the least change in species
   composition; the most xeric stands of P. jeffreyi showed the least gain
   in density and mesic mixed P. ponderosa stands showed the most dramatic
   change in composition and density. We compared these data to records of
   past and present forests in the Sierra Nevada and found parallel trends
   but magnified by the increased precipitation of the Sierra Nevada. We
   also compared VTM data from the San Bernar dino Mountains to mixed
   conifer forests in the Sierra San Pedro Martir of Baja California. These
   Mexican sites and forests are ecologically similar to those in
   California but they still experience unmanaged fire regimes. Californian
   forests of 60 years ago are remarkably similar to modern forests in the
   Sierra San Pedro Martir. Thus, we conclude that forest changes in the
   San Bernardino Mountains are primarily due to lengthening fire
   intervals. Forest changes as a result of fire suppression have important
   conservation consequences for bird species diversity in general and for
   Spotted Owl and Neotropical migrants in particular.}},

Abstract = {{Flume experiments were carried out in 1993 with specially designed
   collectors and inert particles to optimize the effect of various
   structural components of scallop spat collectors. The structural
   components considered were monofilament diameter and density, and mesh
   size of external bags. Results showed that abundance of particles
   trapped in silicone treated collectors did not vary significantly with
   monofilament diameter. The heterogeneous arrangement of monofilament
   also proved to be an important factor. Combinations of monofilament of
   three different diameters (0.17, 0.55 and 0.90 mm), the thinnest being
   the upstream one, collected at least twice as many particles than all
   other single one-sized monofilament collectors. Particle abundance
   decreased with decreasing density of monofilament, and the densest
   arrangement of monofilament captured over four times more particles than
   the least dense arrangement. Collectors with an external bag of
   intermediate mesh size (0.4 x 0.5 cm) were the most efficient at
   collecting particles. The effect of flow speed was also investigated.
   Particles were trapped in significantly greater numbers at flow
   velocities of 5 cms(-1) than at lower or higher velocities. These
   results are consistent with results of field experiments carried out to
   optimize the design of scallop collectors. Enhancement of spat
   collection is possible by modifying collectors. Results from both field
   and flume experiments confirm the hypothesis that larvae of the species
   collected in the field are passive at settlement at the scale of the
   collectors.}},

   phase, (3) separation of B2/L1(2) interfaces, and (4) environmental
   effect. Based on such analyses, a new alloy was designed to minimize the

Abstract = {{The phosphorylation and localization of Drosophila melanogaster
   Replication Protein A (DRP-A) was examined during oogenesis and in
   single embryos during the syncytial nuclear divisions of embryogenesis.
   DRP-A from ovaries was separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis into
   multiple phosphorylated species that include a previously unresolved
   form of RP-A. These forms are developmentally regulated with a major
   phosphorylated form appearing at stage 11 of oogenesis and persisting
   into mature eggs. Actively cycling early embryos were examined to
   investigate DNA replication in the absence of repair synthesis due to
   perturbation by drugs or mutation. An oscillation of the two major forms
   of DRP-A was observed over multiple cell cycles. The phosphorylated form
   was most abundant at mitosis and the nonphosphorylated form at
   interphase. In contrast to other systems where a phosphorylated form of
   RPA has been correlated with S phase, only the nonphosphorylated form of
   Drosophila RP-A is observed in early Drosophila embryos during DNA
   replication. Consistent with this role in DNA metabolism, DRP-A was
   localized to the nucleus. Subsequently at mitosis, DRP-A becomes
   delocalized. Strikingly, in ovaries a relatively large amount of DRP-A
   was observed during the early mitotic stages of oogenesis. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{Objective To determine if serum intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1)
   levels correlate with renal scarring in children with vesico-ureteric
   reflux (VUR).
   Patients and methods Serum ICAM-1 levels were measured in 81 children
   (29 boys and 52 girls, age range 2 months-13 years) with WR using an
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and compared with levels in a
   control group of 24 children (16 boys and eight girls, age range 2
   days-13 years) with no urological abnormalities.
   Results The mean serum ICAM-1 level in the control group was 202 +/- 79
   ng/mL (mean +/- 1 SD) compared with 347 +/- 96 ng/ml in children with
   VUR (P < 0.001). Fifteen of 26 children under 2 years of age
   demonstrated renal scarring while 18 of 44 children older than 2 years
   exhibited renal scarring, The mean serum ICAM-1 level in patients who
   were < 2 years of age and had renal scarring was 408 +/- ng/mL,
   significantly higher than in those who had no renal scarring (296 +/- 68
   ng/mL, P<0.01). In contrast, there was no difference in serum ICAM-1
   levels in patients > 2 years of age with or with no renal scarring (353
   +/- 87 and 325 +/- 91 ng/mL, respectively).
   Conclusion Serum ICAM-1 levels are significantly higher in children with
   VUR and may represent a valuable marker of tubular damage in younger
   children with VUR.}},

Abstract = {{The induction of cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) mRNA in red sea bream Pagrus
   major was investigated using CYP1A cDNA. The CYP1A cDNA was derived from
   a 3-methylcholanthrene (MC)-inducible mRNA of P. major. CYP1A mRNA was
   induced in the liver, gill, gut and kidney after an intraperitoneal
   injection of 3-MC, although the induction levels of mRNA were different
   among these organs. Results of the time course experiment showed that
   the CYP1A mRNA content rapidly increased immediately after the 3-MC
   injection, then showed a slight decrease prior to a further increase
   until at least 70 h after the injection. The CYP1A mRNA content
   increased in a concentration-dependent manner when fish were treated
   with various concentrations of 3-MC. The effect of water temperature on
   the induction of CYP1A mRNA was examined. The level of mRNA content was
   approximately double in fish maintained at 15 degrees C of sea water
   than those at 11 degrees C and 19 degrees C. However, the induction
   levels of CYP1A mRNA were still higher in fish at 11 and 19 degrees C
   than in the control fish.
   These results suggested that the CYP1A mRNA may be useful as a
   biological indicator of the presence and concentration of chemical
   pollutants.}},

Abstract = {{The extent and biomass of the Gracilaria beds in the Luderitz Bay area,
   Namibia were surveyed in winter and summer. The beds covered most of the
   suitable sediments available (grain size 106-212 mu m) and did not occur
   in water shallower than 1 m or deeper than 11 m. Total surface area,
   most of which occurred in the Bay system, changed very little from
   winter to summer but biomass increased by 3.5 fold. In winter, total
   Gracilaria biomass was 200 t and 650 t and in summer, 150 t and 2850 t
   respectively in the Lagoon and Bay. Maximum biomass occurred at 3-4 m in
   the Lagoon and 5-6 m in the Bay in both winter and summer. Gracilaria
   beach cast data from 1987 to 1991 for the area were analysed for
   seasonality and, depending on the specific site, correlated with swell,
   southerly wind velocity and sea temperature. Beach cast in the Lagoon
   system is a more continuous process than in the Bay, where beach casts
   at most sites follow an annual pattern. Wind driven currents and chop
   were the most important causative parameters of beach cast in the Lagoon
   whereas the depth at which the plants were growing and swell were more
   important in the Bay system. The two systems viz. Lagoon and Bay are
   independent of one another with very little or no exchange of Gracilaria
   between them. This was evidenced by the similar percentage each
   contributes to the total beach cast and the similar pattern of beach
   cast from year to year. The decrease in total beach cast from 1989 to
   the end of the study period was attributed to a trend towards increasing
   swell height and low sea temperatures in 1991.}},

   their components in accordance with the botanical events that occur in
   Secale cereale pollen when it is rehydrated. Alterations produced in the
   pollen during manufacturing procedures cause differences in protein
   emission patterns, affecting the final composition of the allergenic
   extract. Moreover, although well-preserved pollen batches released their
   proteins in a similar way, we have detected slight differences in the

Abstract = {{One hundred and forty-two (142) halo nevi were reviewed. For 66 cases
   the diagnosis of halo nevus was made both clinically and pathologically,
   and for 76 cases the diagnosis was based on histological grounds alone.
   The nevi were classified by type and by degree of atypia. Of the 142
   nevi, all were compound, junctional, or intradermal nevi except for one
   case of a Spitz nevus and two cases that could not be further
   classified. For those with a clinicopathological diagnosis of halo
   nevus, 11\% exhibited moderate atypia; 16\% exhibited minimal atypia to
   only focally moderate atypia; 24\% minimal atypia; and 49\% exhibited no
   significant atypia. For those cases where the diagnosis was pathological
   only, there was also a broad spectrum of atypia identified, with 8\%
   exhibiting focally severe or severe atypia. This study supports the
   concept that the halo nevus should not be regarded as a single
   clinicopathological entity, but rather that the halo phenomenon occurs
   in a wide spectrum of nevus types exhibiting a wide spectrum of
   histological atypia. The pathologist is therefore encouraged to classify
   halo nevi on the basis of the nevus cell population alone, using
   whatever classification normally utilized.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of flumazenil (1
   mg iv) on the ventilatory response of premedicated patients receiving a
   continuous infusion of midazolam for sedation. After assessing baseline
   ventilatory function using a modified Read rebreathing method for
   determining hypercapnic ventilatory drive, 16 healthy outpatients were
   administered fentanyl, 50 mu g iv, and midazolam 2 mg iv, followed by a
   variable-rate midazolam infusion, 0.3-0.5 mg . min(-1) . Upon
   termination of the midazolam infusion, serum midazolam concentrations
   were measured and ventilatory function was reassessed. Then, IO ml of
   either saline or flumazenil (1 mg) were administered according to a
   randomized, double-blind protocol. Ventilatory function was subsequently
   measured at 5 min, 30 min and 60 min intervals after study drug.
   Compared with the baseline value, midazolam infusion reduced tidal
   volume and increased respiratory rate and alveolar dead space. However,
   midazolam did not decrease the slope of the CO2-response curve.
   Flumazenil reduced the degree of midazolam-induced sedation and the
   decrease in tidal volume (P < 0.05), but not the change in resting
   respiratory rate. In some patients, the ventilatory response to
   hypercarbia actually decreased after flumazenil administration compared
   with the immediate prereversal (sedated) values. It is concluded that
   midazolam infusion, 0.43 mg . min(-1), did not impair
   CO2-responsiveness. Flumazenil's effect on central ventilatory drive was
   more variable than its reversal of midazolam-induced sedation.}},

Volume = {{231}},

Abstract = {{The binary interaction between human erythrocyte protein 4.1 and rabbit
   skeletal muscle F-actin was examined by rapid pelleting of the binary
   complexes. The binding curves show that the reaction was saturable at
   approximately one protein 4.1 molecule/actin monomer. The reaction was
   highly co-operative, displaying a Hill coefficient close to 2. Using a
   fixed concentration of radiolabelled protein 4.1, and varying the
   concentration of F-actin, the apparent molar association constant, K-a,
   was observed to range from 5X10(4) M(-1) to > 10(6) M(-1). The binary
   interaction between erythrocyte spectrin and actin was also observed to
   be co-operative under the same conditions.
   The rate of reaction between protein 4.1 and actin was temperature
   sensitive in a manner consistent with a high energy of activation. The
   pelleting assay also showed that the concentration of actin was reduced
   in the supernatant in the presence of protein 4.1 compared with actin
   alone, indicating that the critical concentration of actin was lowered
   in the presence of protein 4.1. Polyvalent anions disrupted the binary
   interaction between F-actin and protein 4.1, the disruption being
   consistent with the number of negative charges on these anions at pH
   7.5.
   We postulate that the co-operativity of the binding of protein 4.1 to
   actin results from a protein 4.1 molecule binding to a single monomer
   within the filament structure which then promotes conformational changes
   allowing further protein 4.1 binding. The demonstration of a specific
   binary association between protein 4.1 and actin suggests that this
   interaction contributes significantly to the stabilization of the
   spectrin-actin-protein-4.1 ternary complex.}},

Abstract = {{Cells from a human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y) have been used to
   examine their potential suitability as donor cells for neural
   transplantation. Grafts of SH-SY5Y cells were placed in the basal
   ganglia of the rat brain 7 days after kainic acid lesions of the
   striatum. The animals were killed 4 or 8 weeks following grafting, and
   light and electron microscopic studies showed that the graft formed a
   well-vascularized compact mass of cells in the host brain. At both
   time-points grafted cells showed evidence of cellular differentiation
   with process formation, especially at the graft-host interface where
   there was intermingling of graft and host neuronal process. Electron
   microscopic studies showed that graft cell processes containing
   irregularly-shaped, clear vesicles or membrane-bound dense core
   vesicles, established regions of specialized contact with other graft
   cells and formed close associations with host neuronal processes. There
   was little difference between the grafts of different ages, except that
   in the older grafts there were early signs of neurodegeneration. Since
   the SH-SY5Y cells used in these grafts express the enzyme tyrosine
   hydroxylase and synthesize dopamine in vitro, these cells were used in
   the hope that they may potentially be useful for repairing lesions in
   the dopamine pathway, such as that seen in Parkinson's disease. Our
   behavioural studies show that grafting SH-SY5Y cells into the striatum
   of rats with 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the median forebrain bundle
   result in a reduction of amphetamine-induced rotation. However, this was
   unlikely to be due to dopamine release since there was no tyrosine
   hydroxylase immunoreactivity seen in the region of the grafts. Thus
   grafted human neuroblastoma cells survive, establish specialized
   morphological associations with graft and host processes and improve
   behavioural deficits resulting from and hydroxydopamine lesions. We
   suggest that grafted differentiated human neuroblastoma cells can
   interact with cells in the host brain with beneficial effects, and that
   in the medium-term, neuroblastoma grafts will make useful models for
   examining graft-host interactions. However, the presence of early
   degenerative changes in the older grafts suggests that neuroblastoma
   cells may not be suitable for long-term neural transplantation therapy
   for neurodegenerative diseases.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical investigation is presented of steady and unsteady heat
   transfer in axially and radially diluted nuclear fuel rods. The
   transient performance is assumed to follow a sudden and complete loss of
   coolant starting from steady state operation. Steady state conditions
   are obtained from solving numerically a conjugate conduction problem in
   the fuel rod and a turbulent forced convection problem in the coolant
   section. To model turbulence, the mixing length model is used. Dilution
   is accomplished by adding high thermal property materials, either
   axially or radially, to the original fuel rods with the intention of
   increasing the time delay Before melting of the reactor in case of loss
   of coolant. The effects of the amount, distribution, and material of
   added diluent on steady and unsteady heat transfer are studied. Results
   indicate that axial dilution has negligible influence on the thermal
   performance of the reactor. Radial dilution, however, holds great
   promise and shows a reduction in the maximum wall and fuel temperatures
   under steady operation and a substantial increase in the time delay
   before melting under transient conditions. The value of this time delay
   increases as the amount of added diluent is increased. Moreover, the
   distribution of the added diluent is shown to have small effects on the
   steady and unsteady performance of the reactor, while the type of
   diluent material is found to affect the transient performance only.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of porcine bioprostheses and mechanical prostheses in
   multiple valve replacement operations was evaluated in 494 patients with
   553 operations between 1975 and 1992. Porcine bioprostheses were
   implanted in 351 multiple replacement operations and 202 operations were
   performed with mechanical prostheses. The mean age of the bioprosthesis
   group was 59.1 +/- 14.4 years and of the mechanical prostheses group,
   55.9 +/- 13.3 years. Concomitant procedures, primarily coronary artery
   bypass grafting, were performed in 27.4\% (96 patients) of the
   bioprosthesis group and 20.8\% (42 patients) of the mechanical
   prosthesis group (p = not significant {[}NS]). The early mortality for
   the bioprosthesis group (BP) was 12.0\% (42 patients), whereas for the
   mechanical prosthesis (MP) group it was 10.9\% (22 patients) with no
   difference (p = NS) for the performance with or without concomitant
   procedures, primarily coronary artery bypass grafting. The total
   cumulative follow-up was 1,914 years for BP and 458 years for MP group.
   The late mortality was different between the groups (p < 0.05),
   6.1\%/patient-year for BP and 3.7\%/patient-year for MP. The difference
   in late mortality was not different (p = NS) for performance of
   concomitant procedures and not different (p = NS) for the absence of
   concomitant procedures, 5.6\%/patient-year for BP and 2.2\%/patient-year
   for MP. The freedom from thromboembolism- and antithromboembolic-related
   hemorrhage favored the biological population (p < 0.05) at 10 years with
   79.7\% +/- 3.4\% for BP and 75.4\% +/- 5.0\% for MP. The freedom from
   structural valve deterioration was 100\% for MP, whereas for the BP
   group, 94.7\% +/- 1.6\% at 5 years and 65.9\% +/- 4.3\% at 10 years. The
   freedom from valve-related mortality was not different (p = NS), at 10
   years, 83.9\% +/- 3.3\% for bioprostheses and 96.8\% +/- 1.4\% for
   mechanical prostheses. The freedom from residual morbidity (permanent
   impairment) was different (p < 0.05), 93.6\% +/- 2.2\% for bioprostheses
   and 91.7\% +/- 3.1\% for mechanical prostheses. The freedom from
   valve-related reoperation did not differentiate the groups (p = NS) for
   BP, 94.5\% +/- 1.5\% at 5 years and 60.4\% +/- 4.4\% at 10 years and for
   MP, 95.5\% +/- 2.5\% at 5 years and 86.8\% +/- 8.5\% at 10 years. The
   freedom from fatal reoperation was 93.5\% +/- 2.5\% for BP and 98.8\%
   +/- 0.8\% for MP at 10 years (p = NS). The overall complications favored
   the biological group (p < 0.05) with freedom at 5 years of 80.9\% +/-
   2.5\% for BP and 71.6\% +/- 5.0\% for MP, but by 10 years it was 41.7\%
   +/- 4.1\% for BP and 71.6\% +/- 5.0\% for MF. The early mortality for
   reoperation in these multiple valve replacement groups was 16.3\%
   overall, 15.3\% for the bioprostheses group (13 of 85 patients) and
   28.6\% for the mechanical group (2 of 7 patients) (p = NS). Twenty-four
   patients had incidental replacement of an additional bioprosthesis at
   reoperation without a fatality. Bioprostheses in multiple valve
   replacement operations provided less valve-related morbidity and
   equivalent freedom from reoperative mortality when clinical performance
   of these bioprostheses and mechanical prostheses was evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{Low energy (15-50 eV) noble gas ion irradiation at low temperatures ( <
   300 degrees C) enables formation of a Si(001)-2 X 1 surface
   reconstruction that has been hydrogen-terminated by a hydrofluoric acid
   dip prior to irradiation. Using 15 eV He+ irradiation, a (2 X 1)
   reconstruction can be formed at temperatures as low as 50 degrees C, the
   lowest temperature ever reported for formation of this reconstruction.
   The (2 X 1) reconstruction occurs as a result of surface hydrogen
   removal by sputtering and recoil implantation into the silicon
   substrate. Molecular dynamics simulations of low energy irradiation of a
   hydrogen-terminated silicon surface indicate that chemically-enhanced
   physical sputtering of silicon occurs in addition to physical sputtering
   of hydrogen. The hydrogen sputtering yield is found to be strongly
   dependent on surface hydrogen coverage. The results suggest that low
   energy ion irradiation can be used to tailor the hydrogen coverage, and
   thus also the chemical reactivity of the silicon surface.}},

Abstract = {{Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been reported to conform to a quasispecies

   relationship between the nucleotide complexity and diversity of
   hypervariable region 1 and various stages of the carrier states, The
   subjects studied were 20 HCV carriers with normal alanine
   aminotransferase (ALT) levels, 50 patients with chronic hepatitis who
   showed elevated ALT levels, 22 with cirrhosis, and 24 with
   hepatocellular carcinoma. The quasispecies completely was analyzed by
   means of polymerase chain reaction-mediated single strand conformation
   polymorphism (PCR-SSCP). The value of nucleotide diversity was
   calculated by PCR cloning and sequencing, The number of SSCP bands
   ranged from I to 7, with no significant differences in the mean numbers
   among the stages of HCV infection. There was no correlation between the
   amounts of serum HCV RNA and the numbers of SSCP bands. No significant
   difference was found in the values of nucleotide diversity between
   carriers with normal ALT levels (mean, 6.6 x 10(-2) per site) and
   patients with chronic hepatitis (7.7 x 10(-2)). These findings suggest
   that the quasispecies complexity of hypervariable region 1 is
   independent of the stage of chronic HCV infection.}},

Abstract = {{Offshore structures must be designed against failure resulting from both
   fatigue and high forces due to extreme environmental conditions. The
   common procedure is to expose the structure to a range of regular waves
   whose heights and periods are determined from the long-term probability
   distribution of the waveheights and their associated periods at the
   site. However, in reality these structures are exposed to random
   wave-induced forces in the ocean environment, and hence it is inherently
   much more satisfactory to account for the randomness of the loading by
   establishing the probabilistic properties of the loading and the
   resulting responses. The major obstacle is the nonlinearity of the drag
   component of Morison's wave loading which results in non-Gaussian
   distributions for both loading and response. In this paper, progress
   made to date towards a systematic probabilistic analysis of fixed
   jacket-type offshore structures will be reviewed. (C) 1995 Academic

Abstract = {{To explore the mechanisms of inhibition of insulin secretion in
   pancreatic beta-cells by oxygen free radicals, we studied the effects of
   H2O2 on membrane currents using the patch-clamp technique. Exposure of
   beta-cells to H2O2 (greater than or equal to 30 mu mol/l) increased the
   activity of ATP-sensitive potassium (K-ATP(+)) channels without changing
   the single channel conductance in cell-attached membrane patches. Action
   currents observed during superfusion of 11.1 mmol/l glucose were
   suppressed. In inside-out membrane patches, the activity of K-ATP(+)
   channels was not influenced by H2O2. In conventional whole-cell clamp
   experiments using a pipette solution containing 3 mmol/l ATP, H2O2 did
   not influence the membrane currents. However, H2O2 did activate the
   K-ATP(+) channel current in perforated whole-cell clamp configurations.
   The increased K-ATP(+) channel current was reversed by subsequent
   exposure to 11.1 mmol/l 2-ketoisocaproic acid. In cell-attached membrane
   patches, the K-ATP(+) channel current evoked by exposure to 30 mu mol/l
   H2O2 was inhibited by exposure to 11.1 mmol/l glyceraldehyde, whereas
   the channel was again activated by exposure to 0.3 mmol/l H2O2.
   Subsequent superfusion of 11.1 mmol/l 2-ketoisocaproic acid inhibited
   the channel; this effect was counteracted by exposure to 10 mmol/l H2O2.
   Transient inhibition of K-ATP(+) channels with provocation of action
   potentials was observed after washout of 100 mu mol/l H2O2 during
   superfusion of 2.8 or 11.1 mmol/l glucose. me conclude that H2O2 has no
   direct effect on the K-ATP(+) channels but that it indirectly activates
   the channels when it is exposed to beta-cells under conditions in which
   the cellular metabolism is physiologically regulated.}},

   provides the exact counting of third-order products of all eleven

   multiplications for the selective counting of third-order products at
   each position, and the algorithm, which is thus efficient, can be easily

Abstract = {{Experimental values of ultrasonic dispersion are determined in eight

   echoskop, at 500 kHz and 24 MHz, at various temperatures. Both velocity
   (V) and it's dispersion (V-omega- V-0) are found to decrease with
   temperature. Expressions are worked out for the compressional relaxation
   time (tau), using the concepts of complex ({*}) and frequency (omega)
   dependent bulk viscosity coefficient and compressibility of the liquid,
   in terms of the dispersion (V-omega - V-0) and velocity (V-omega) of the
   wave in the medium. The value of tau is found to vary with {[}(V-omega -
   V-0)/V-omega](1/2). The velocity (V-omega) at the compressional
   relaxation frequency (i.e.. omega tau=1) is found to be twice the low
   frequency velocity (i.e. V-0). Temperature (T) variations of tau in
   various liquids, are used to calculate their molecular activation
   energies (W) by plotting the linear variations between log(10) tau and
   1/TK. The ultrasonic (or compressional) relaxation times in these

Abstract = {{Endothelium-derived nitric oxide: The endothelium is a source of
   vasoactive factors among which the most relevant are nitric oxide and
   endothelin. Nitric oxide is synthesized from L-arginine by a family of
   nitric oxide synthases and is a widespread biological mediator. It is
   implicated in many physiological and pathophysiological processes,
   including a variety of cardiovascular diseases like hypertension.
   Nitric oxide and hypertension: The release of nitric oxide seems to be
   modulated by changes in blood pressure. However, the role of nitric
   oxide in hypertension is still controversial and seems to vary depending
   on the stage of the disease and the model studied. In spontaneous
   hypertension, the production of nitric oxide is increased but
   inefficacious, probably because of increased inactivation or scavenging.
   In the heart the production of nitric oxide seems to be increased,
   probably as a compensatory mechanism against hypertension. In
   salt-induced hypertension, nitric oxide production may be impaired. In
   human hypertension, pharmacological experiments reveal an impaired
   nitric oxide dilator mechanism. In pulmonary hypertension, the use of
   nitric oxide gas inhalation has been proposed as a future therapy for
   this condition.
   Endothelin: Endothelin-1 is a potent vasoconstrictor peptide produced
   and released from endothelial cells. In isolated blood vessels,
   endothelin causes profound contraction. The hemodynamic effects of
   endothelin can be explained by the activation of two endothelin
   receptors, ET(A) and ET(B). The relationship between endothelin and
   hypertension is not clear. Although plasma endothelin levels are normal
   in most patients with essential hypertension, the hypertensive blood
   vessel wall may contract more profoundly in response to the peptide;
   hence, endothelin antagonists may have antihypertensive effects in
   patients with hypertension.}},

Abstract = {{Forty-five Brazilian populations of freshwater Audouinella were analysed
   using multivariate morphometrics. These populations were statistically
   related to seven type specimens. Five species are recognised on the
   basis of qualitative (plant colour and size, basal system type and
   branch angle) and quantitative (length and diameter of vegetative cells
   and monosporangia) characters. A. hermannii (syn. A. violacea) is
   characterised by a reddish colour, an irregular prostrate basal system,
   open branch angles (greater than or equal to 25 degrees) and small
   monosporangia (less than or equal to 15 mu m in diameter). A. macrospora
   (syn. A. chalybea var. brasiliensis) is distinguished from the other
   Brazilian species by having a bluish colour, a basal system composed of
   well-developed rhizoids, narrow branch angles (< 25 degrees) and large
   monosporangia (greater than or equal to 15 mu m in diameter). A.
   meiospora is microscopic and has a reddish colour, a basal system
   composed of creeping filaments, narrow branch angles and small
   monosporangia. A. pysmaea (syn. A. leibleinii) is characterised by being
   bluish, having an irregular prostrate basal system, narrow branch angles
   and small monosporangia. A, tenella is distinct from the other species
   by having a reddish colour, an irregular prostrate basal system, open
   branch angles, small monosporangia and small vegetative cells (less than
   or equal to 6 mu m in diameter). An identification key and revised
   descriptions and synonyms are presented for the five species. A.
   meiospora and A. tenella are reported for the first time for Brazil. A.
   macrospora and A. pygmaea were the most widespread species and occurred
   in tropical and subtropical regions. A. meiospora was found at two sites
   in a tropical rainforest region, whereas A. hermannii and A. tenella
   were found at only one site. Selected physical and chemical
   environmental data (temperature, specific conductance, current velocity,
   turbidity, pH and dissolved oxygen) are presented for most species.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental and clinical investigations of patients resuscitated after

   post-resuscitation processes involve not only the CNS, but also the
   entire body and may lead to severe disability and even death of the
   seemingly successfully revived body. The data available suggests that
   this post-resuscitation pathology is a new nosological entity - a
   post-resuscitation disease. This disease has it own specific etiology,
   pathogenesis, variants of the clinical course (a number of syndromes)
   and the system of treatment and rehabilitation. In view of the ever
   wider use of resuscitation in clinical practice, it is expedient to
   organize an all-round study of this nosological entity, the optimum
   systems of its treatment, and to include this entity into International

   that the inhibiting factors to goats and sheep husbandry are related to
   the farm size, level of technology, credit, relations between research
   and extension, formal education and adverse environment. The results of
   the factorial analysis indicated that the five main factors are
   responsible for 56,6\% of the total variation on the data from 118
   farms, and 22 active variables. In the factorial analysis, the first
   factor explains 24,5\% of the total variation, and the high coefficients
   of saturation related to goat (0.90060) and to sheep (0.8946) indicated
   that they are the main responsible for the increase of the small

Abstract = {{EEG recordings obtained after generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS)
   often show postictal slowing, but the duration of the period of the
   slowing has not been studied systematically. We assessed the duration of
   this period, defined as time until complete EEG normalization or
   stabilization. Sixty-seven adult patients with GTCS of unknown origin
   had an EEC performed less than or equal to 24 h after a seizure, with
   successive recordings made every 24 h thereafter, until the EEG
   normalized or until three successive tracings were unchanged.
   Comprehensive evaluation excluded other encephalopathic conditions. An
   abnormal first EEG that subsequently improved was observed in 21
   patients (31\%) and was associated with older age, disease duration, and
   antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment. Postictal slowing was observed for
   less than or equal to 1 week (mean 2.4 +/- 1.6 days), with no associated
   overt confusional state. Age and AEDs were not associated with longer
   time for EEG normalization or return to baseline. Postictal slowing

   4. Experimental manipulation of nectar volumes and concentrations
   permitted the direct demonstration of nectar reabsorption under field

Abstract = {{When an adsorbed film is formed at an uncharged interface, then an
   electric field is established across this film created by the dipoles of
   the adsorbed species. Similarly, an electric field may be established
   parallel to the adsorbing surface from the in-plane dipoles of the
   adsorbed species. These electric fields affect the dipole-dipole
   interactions and therefore they influence the surface activities of the
   adsorbed species. Their effect on the surface activities was taken into
   account by means of the electrostatic theory of dielectrics and the
   Gauss theorem which was used to correlate the potential drop across and
   parallel to the adsorbed layer with its composition. Then based
   exclusively on the properties of the various thermodynamic functions of
   the surface solution the chemical/electrochemical potentials of the
   constituents of this layer were derived without additional modelistic
   assumptions. In this approach the molecular information, which is fitted
   to thermodynamic arguments, is more general and therefore more reliable
   than that obtained from a certain model. The new adsorption isotherms,
   which arise from the chemical/electrochemical potentials, can take into
   account changes in the surface layer dielectric constant and the
   orientation of the adsorbed species during the adsorption process. The
   isotherms were compared with a variety of experimental data and a good
   agreement was found in all cases.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To evaluate the ability of stent-grafts made with
   polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft material to improve transjugular
   intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) patency.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: TIPS were created in 13 swine by using
   PTFE-covered stent-grafts. Uncovered TIPS were placed in 13 other swine.
   Twenty-one of 26 animals were followed up with portal venography for 3
   months or until the shunt became severely stenotic. Five animals without
   severe stenosis were sacrificed before 3 months because of illness.
   RESULTS: At 4 weeks after TIPS placement, nine of 13 stent-graft TIPS
   were patent (<50\% diameter narrowing) compared with only one patent
   stent in 13 uncovered TIPS. Six of 13 stent-graft TIPS remained patent
   until the animals were sacrificed. In 11 of 12 uncovered TIPS, stenosis
   was most prominent in the parenchymal tract. In five of seven
   stent-graft TIPS, stenosis was most prominent in the hepatic vein above
   the end of the graft material. Bile leaks were discovered in six
   occluded uncovered TIPS and in two of the stent-graft TIPS.
   CONCLUSION: PTFE-covered stent-grafts significantly improved TIPS
   patency in swine (P < .01). However, stenosis in the hepatic vein led to
   late shunt malfunction in selected cases.}},

Abstract = {{The present study was undertaken to examine the effects of cyclic
   administration of low-dose progestogen on endometrial carcinogenesis in
   mice. A total of 115 female ICR mice, 10 weeks of age, were divided into
   four experimental and control groups. Mice in groups 1-3 received
   laparotomy and were injected with N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) solution
   at a dose of 1 mg/100 g body weight to the left uterine tube and with
   normal saline to the right uterine tube. From one week after the MNU
   exposure, groups 1 and 2 were given 5 ppm 17 beta-estradiol
   (E(2))-containing diet throughout the experiment. Mice in group 1
   received 5 s.c. injections of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) (2
   mg/mouse) at intervals of 4 weeks from week 7. Group 3 was treated with
   MNU/normal saline alone. Group 4 consisted of mice treated with MPA
   alone. At the termination of the experiment (week 30), all animals were
   killed and autopsied for pathological examinations. It was found that
   adenocarcinomas and preneoplastic lesions developed in the bilateral
   uterine corpora in mice of groups 1-3. MPA treatment significantly
   decreased the weight of the uterine corpus (P < 0.05) and the incidences
   of endometrial adenocarcinoma and atypical or adenomatous (P < 0.001)
   but not cystic glandular hyperplasias in the MNU/E(2)-treated groups.
   Additionally, MPA treatment tended to decrease the proliferating cell
   nuclear antigen-labeling index in endometrial glandular cells. These
   data indicate that MPA, even at low dose, has an inhibitory effect on
   mouse endometrial carcinogenesis induced by MNU and E(2).}},

   (8-(noradamantan-3-yl)-1,3-dipropylxanthine), a novel adenosine

Abstract = {{Complementary neutron and magnetic x-ray scattering experiments have
   been performed on the pseudobinary compound USb0.8Te0.2. Both techniques
   reveal a succession of magnetic phases on cooling. On passing through
   the Neel temperature (T-N similar to 205 K), the system enters an
   antiferromagnetic (AF) state of modulation wave vector q similar to 0.4
   reciprocal lattice units. Cooling further a second AF modulation (q
   similar to 0.2) appears which coexists with the q similar to 0.4
   modulation over a narrow range of temperature. The appearance of the q
   similar to 0.2 scattering coincides with the onset of ferromagnetic (q =
   0) order in the sample. The antiferromagnetic q similar to 0.2
   modulation persists over a significant range of temperature in a mixed
   state with the emerging ferromagnetism. At the lowest temperatures
   studied, however, the system is found to be a saturated ferromagnet with
   no AF component. In the case of the x-ray study the onset of
   ferromagnetism is inferred from the concomitant distortion of the charge
   lattice. The smallest value of the magnetic peak width in the AF phase
   was always larger than the width of the neighboring lattice peak,
   consistent with finite-size effects in the ordered antiferromagnetism.
   Above T-N critical scattering is observed in the paramagnetic phase by
   both techniques. The x-ray critical scattering may be described by a
   single (Lorentzian) function corresponding to a single correlation
   length, in contrast to recent observations on several other systems. The
   results obtained in the neutron and x-ray experiments are compared and
   discussed.}},

   of dopa(dihydroxyphenylalanine)-responsive dystonia. Clinical
   investigations have broadened the spectrum of disease with particular
   attention manifestations in infancy. Pathophysiological investigations
   have revealed features that distinguish dopa-responsive dystonia from
   childhood-onset parkinsonism. A pathological study has confirmed the
   `developmental' nature of the disease. Finally, mutations causing the
   autosomal dominant form of dopa-responsive dystonia have been identified
   in the gene coding for CTP cyclohydrolase I. Mutations in tyrosine
   hydroxylase have been identified in two brothers and put forward as
   evidence of an autosomal recessive form of the disease.}},

Abstract = {{Acacia karroo Hayne is the most important woody invader of grassland in
   South Africa, and can greatly reduce the productivity of grassland. A
   field experiment was conducted to test the hypotheses that emergence,
   growth and the 1st year's survival of Acacia karroo would be enhanced by
   (1) defoliation of the grass sward, (2) increased irradiance, (3)
   increased moisture availability and (4) its germination within cattle
   dung pats. The study was conducted on one site above and one below the
   natural altitudinal treeline of this species in grassland of the eastern
   Cape, South Africa. Not one seedling emerged from dung pats. Neither
   location nor the other treatments affected the density of emerging
   seedlings, although only 40.4 seedlings m(-2) emerged of the 200 seeds
   m(-2) planted. Shading dramatically increased the density of surviving
   seedlings. In the open, only 3 and 1.5 seedlings m(-2) remained
   respectively at the end of the growing season or the beginning of the
   next, compared to 23.3 and 19.5 seedlings m(-2) under shading for these
   respective times. This was attributed to the effect of shade on moisture
   availability in a season which received only 54\% of average rainfall.
   Seedling survival until the end of the growing season was enhanced
   (30\%) by shade at both sites, but also by supplemental water (24\%,)
   and defoliation of the sward (7\%) at the site above the treeline.
   Across sites and treatments, seedling survival was related to moisture
   availability, with no or poor survival for < 500 mm rainfall, indicating
   this species can only establish in certain rainfall years. Seedling
   survival over winter was not influenced by treatment, but was greater
   for larger seedlings. Treatments affected seedling size, in particular
   seedlings growing under shade and within a dense grass canopy were
   etiolated. A. karroo seedlings are capable of establishing and surviving
   within a dense grass sward for at least a year, tolerant of low
   irradiance and of interference, which, because most seeds do not persist
   for much longer than a year, suggests this species forms predominantly a
   seedling bank. This has implications for the invasion of grassland by
   woody species.}},

Abstract = {{A questionnaire survey of 260 health care workers from 13 randomly
   selected health care facilities was undertaken. Their knowledge,
   attitude, belief and blood handling practices regarding HIV/AIDS were
   enquired about. Virtually all (99.0\%) respondents had heard about AIDS
   but only 57.0\% had seen an AIDS patient before, Although 83.0\% knew
   that AIDS is caused by a virus; a high proportion still confuses mode of
   transmission with causative agent. Deficient knowledge was exhibited
   when asked about groups of people who were at a higher risk of
   contracting HIV and AIDS: Only 54.6\% and 51.5\% identified homosexuals
   and IV drug users as being at a higher risk. Almost all (97.0\%) of our
   respondents claimed to have been more careful in their blood handling
   practices since the emergence of AIDS, 68.5\% wore gloves for all
   procedures involving handling of blood and 28.5\% sometimes although as
   many as 30.4\%, 40.4\% and 18.1\% do not wear gloves for cleaning up
   blood stained materials. nursing procedures and taking obstetric
   delivery respectively. It was evident from their responses that not all
   the health workers knew the correct method for disposing of used
   blood-stained instruments and left-over blood samples and neither were
   they all adhering to the Safety guidelines recommended for handling
   these materials. Education of all health care workers in Nigeria on the

Abstract = {{Purpose: To assess more thoroughly the prognostic significance of

   Materials and Methods: Univariate and multivariate stepwise regression
   analysis was performed on results of a 10-year series of 251 consecutive
   men who underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy for clinically
   localized carcinoma,
   Results: Gleason score, operative blood loss and pathological stage were
   significantly (p<0.0001) associated with progression-free survival. A
   risk ratio of 1.08 (95\% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.10) was
   demonstrated for every 100 mi. of operative blood loss.
   Conclusions: The operative blood loss but not the type tautologous or
   allogeneic) of blood transfused was significantly related to decreased
   recurrence-free survival after radical retropubic prostatectomy. This
   finding implies that the operative events necessitating transfusion are
   potentially more significant than the immunological effects of the

Abstract = {{We characterized TRAS1, a retrotransposable element which was inserted
   into the telomeric repetitive sequence (CCTAA)(n) of the silkworm,
   Bombyx mori. The complete sequence of TRAS1, a stretch of 7.8 kb with a
   poly(A) tract at the 3' end, was determined. No long terminal repeat
   (LTR) was found at the termini of the element. TRAS1 contains gag- and
   pol-like open reading frames (ORFs) which are similar to those of
   non-LTR retrotransposons. The two ORFs overlap but are one nucleotide
   out of frame (+1 frameshift), Most of the approximately 250 copies of
   TRAS1 elements in the genome were highly conserved in the structure,
   Chromosomal in situ hybridization showed that TRAS1 elements are
   clustered at the telomeres of Bombyx chromosomes. A phylogenetic
   analysis using the amino acid sequence of the reverse transcriptase
   domain within the pol-like ORF revealed that TRAS1 falls into one
   lineage with R1, which is a family of non-LTR retrotransposons inserted
   into the same site within the 28S ribosomal DNA unit in most insects.
   TRAS1 may have been derived from R1 and changed the target specificity
   so that TRAS1 inserts into the telomeric repetitive sequence (CCTAA)(n).
   Southern hybridization and Bal 31 exonuclease analyses showed that TRAS1
   elements are clustered proximal to the terminal long tract of
   (CCTAA)(n). TRAS1 is a novel family of non-LTR retrotransposons which
   are inserted into the telomeric repetitive sequences as target sites.}},

Abstract = {{Insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) participate in energy
   metabolism, regulate cellular growth and differentiation, and are
   thought to act locally in a paracrine manner through specific receptors.
   Systemic levels of these peptides in humans and primates are directly
   associated with levels of activity of the reproductive axis. To date, it
   is unclear whether these peptides participate in reproductive function
   by acting at the level of the GnRH neuron. In this study we examined the
   effects of IGF-I, IGF-II and insulin on immortalized GnRH-secreting
   neurons, the GTI-7 cell line. The GTI-7 cells expressed all three
   members of the insulin receptor family as determined by analysis of
   I-125-IGF-I, I-125-IGF-II and I-125-insulin binding sites. Insulin
   receptors bound insulin, IGF-II and IGF-I with a ratio of potency of
   1:5:20. IGF-I and IGF-II receptors bound both IGF-I and IGF-II. The
   ratio of potency of IGF-I/IGF-II was 1:5 for the IGF-I receptor and
   100:1 for the IGF-II receptor. The binding characteristics of the growth
   factors at 22 degrees C suggested the possibility that these cells may
   secrete IGF binding proteins. To ensure that changes in GnRH levels in
   the media were due to secretion and not to changes in cell number, the
   mitogenic effect of these peptides on GTI cells was evaluated. Both
   insulin and IGF-I were strong mitogens (48-hour incubation), restoring
   cell number to that of serum-replete cultures at a dose of 0.1 ng/ml. A
   100-fold higher dose of IGF-II was required to produce a similar level
   of mitogenicity, implicating an action through the IGF-I and/or insulin
   receptor. Due to these mitogenic effects, the effect of insulin, IGF-I
   and IGF-II on GnRH secretion was studied after shortterm exposure.
   Insulin and IGF-I did not affect GnRH secretion, but IGF-II had a
   biphasic effect on GnRH release after 2 h of incubation (a maximum
   stimulatory effect occurred with a 0.1 ng/ml dose). In order to examine
   the signal transduction mechanism, the role of cytoplasmic calcium
   mobilization in IGF-II-induced GnRH secretion was examined in single
   cells using calcium imaging. The effect of IGF-II on GnRH secretion
   appeared to operate via a calcium-independent mechanism. The studies
   document an insulin/IGF system in the GTI-7 neuronal cell line and show
   that insulin and IGFs can exert direct effects on the immortalized GnRH
   neurons. The ability of these agents to stimulate mitogenesis and/or
   secretion suggests that these peptides may play some role in the early
   development or maturation of GnRH neurons in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the pharmacokinetics of intravenous phenytoin in
   critically ill infants and children with acute neurologic injury.
   Design: A prospective, descriptive study.
   Setting: A pediatric intensive care unit.
   Patients: Sixteen children, 0.5 to 16 yrs of age (mean 7.6), with
   various types of acute neurologic injuries, receiving intravenous
   phenytoin therapy.
   Interventions: Blood samples were collected to measure total and free
   phenytoin concentrations in plasma, A 24-hr urine collection was made to
   determine the concentrations of the major metabolite of phenytoin.
   Measurements and Main Results: In 12 children who survived the acute
   illness, a lower-than-predicted Michaelis-Menten constant (K-m) and
   higher-than-predicted maximum rate of metabolism (V-max) were observed.
   Initial free phenytoin fractions ranged between 0.08 and 0.15, In the
   eight patients who had additional free fractions measured, six patients
   demonstrated an increase (9.1\% to 34\% increase) in free fraction,
   while two patients demonstrated a decrease (1.8\% and 19.8\% decrease)
   in free fraction. The ratio of amount of phenytoin to phenytoin plus
   5-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-5-phenylhydantoin excreted in the urine in a 24-hr
   urine collection demonstrated a wide interpatient variability. There was
   no correlation in the difference between the predicted and calculated
   K-m and V-max values and Glasgow Coma Score, circulating albumin
   concentration, or concomitant medications.
   Conclusion: Based on the average R(m) and V-max values of the children
   enrolled in our study, it appears that children with neurologic injury
   between the ages of 0.5 and 9 yrs may require dosages of at least 8 to
   10 mg/kg/day, and children aged 10 to 16 yrs may require 6 to 8
   mg/kg/day to attain therapeutic phenytoin concentrations.}},

   Electrostatic effects of the nm-sized particles on the transport
   properties of wide 2DEG structures are very weak, whereas the
   magnetoresistance properties of a narrow channel were altered
   significantly in the presence of only a few lead particles smaller than

Abstract = {{Cercis is a genus with a geographically disjunct distribution in North
   America, southern Europe, and eastern Asia. The architecture of
   cauliflory (flowering from the lower branch and trunk areas of woody
   plants) was examined in 10 taxa, including 9 of the 11 recognized
   species in the genus Cercis. In each taxon, a linear series of
   first-order buds (distinguished as 1) was formed in the axils of
   vegetative leaves before shoot elongation ceased. The first-order bud
   developed into either a vegetative shoot or more frequently into an
   inflorescence. Inflorescences matured and then abscised. Second-order
   and higher order buds were produced in the axils of the basal bud scales
   of abscised inflorescences. In addition, vegetative shoots that were
   from first- or higher order buds produced first order buds
   (distinguished as 1') in their leaf axils. Buds from the axils of the
   basalmost leaves of these vegetative shoots, together with higher order
   buds from the parent shoot, perpetuated the cauliflorous condition in
   all taxa studied. Since cauliflory was present and since the
   architecture of cauliflory was similar in all taxa studied, regardless
   of geographic distribution, cauliflory probably arose only once in
   Cercis, before the genus radiated from its site of origin.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a multistep cascade model for the deexcitation of highly
   charged ions in the presence of a solid. We apply this model to analyze
   the yield of the KLL-Auger peak as measured in angular resolved electron
   energy spectra. The calculation makes use of three probability
   densities, one for the time distribution of the Auger decay, one for the
   transport of the ions through the first atomic layers of the target, and
   the last one for the transport of the electrons from the source to the
   detector. Each of these probabilities is discussed and modeled. The
   calculations are compared to measurements of KLL-Auger electrons from
   low-energy Ne9+ ions impinging on solid Al. The results support previous
   estimations that the L-shell sidefeeding of the projectile depends on
   the incident velocity. For ion energies greater than 1000 eV, the mean
   path length needed to capture an electron is found to be approximately
   equal to the next-neighbor distance in the Al lattice. We estimate the
   yield of KLL electrons emitted from Ne ions with 2, 3,...,8 electrons in
   the L shell. The mean depth of emission of the KLL electron is
   determined.}},

   years. For IHD death the age-adjusted relative risks (RRs) and 95\%
   confidence intervals (CI) for a 1 mmol/l increase in cholesterol were RR
   = 1.17 (1.07, 1.27) (men) and RR = 1.22 (1.12, 1.33) (women). The RRs
   for stroke were 0.99 (men) and 1.07 (women). In men and younger women,
   urea and smoking were important predictors of IHD and stroke death. Age
   differences were present in women for both urea and smoking. For IHD in
   women, smoking: RR = 2.65 (1.80, 3.89) (< 60 years) and RR = 1.38 (1.01,

Abstract = {{A consolidated paper coating is modeled as a three-dimensional network
   of 1000 pore bodies and interconnecting passages. The distributions of
   moisture and binder within a drying coating are examined using equations
   that describe the pore-level physics of meniscus-driven water flow,
   vapor diffusion, and binder transport and deposition. The model shows
   that pores do not dry exclusively from the surface into the coating
   unless the drying rate is extremely high. Rather, pore bodies usually
   empty in the order of their size and accessibility to the gas phase. The
   model includes two numbers that characterize binder transport in the
   coating: (a) a capillary number that describes the competition between
   capillary driving force of and viscous resistance to flow and (b) a
   Peclet number that describes the competition between convection toward
   and diffusion away from evaporating pores. The two numbers reflect
   effects of drying rate and binder diffusivity on binder migration.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical simulation of the turbulent transport from an isolated heat
   source in a square cavity with side openings is presented in this work,
   The openings allow an externally induced air stream at ambient
   temperature to flow through the cavity and, thus, mixed convection
   arises. Results for the turbulent regime are obtained by employing a.
   suitable, high-Reynolds-number form of the K-E turbulence model. A
   stream function-vorticity mathematical formulation is used, along with
   the kinetic energy and dissipation rate equations and an expression for
   the eddy viscosity. A time-marching scheme is employed, using the ADI
   method. The values of the Reynolds number Re, associated with the
   external flow, and the Grashof number Gr, based on the heat flux from
   the source, for which turbulent flow sets in are sought. Two typical
   values of the Reynolds number are chosen, Re = 1000 and Re = 2000, and
   turbulent results are obtained in the range Gr = 5 X 10(7)-5 X 10(8).
   For both values of Re, the average Nusselt number over the surface of
   the source is found to vary with Gr in a fashion consistent with
   previous numerical and experimental results far closed cavities, while
   the effect of Re in the chosen range of values was small.}},

Abstract = {{A phenotypic and genotypic survey was conducted on 36 Apert syndrome
   patients. In all but one patient, an FGFR2 mutation, either S252W or
   P253R, was found in exon IIIa (exon U or 7). The frequency was 71\% and
   26\%, for the mutations S252W and P253R, respectively. These mutations
   occur in the linker region between immunoglobulin-like domains II and
   Iii, which are involved in activation of the receptor by ligand binding
   and dimerization. The fact that one patient did not have a mutation in
   the same exon suggests further genetic heterogeneity in Apert syndrome.
   The frequencies of occurrence or means for measurements of 29 different
   clinical features (including severity of craniofacial features,
   syndactyly of the hands and feet, and multisystem involvement) were
   determined for all patients and for the two subgroups defined by their
   mutations. Comparison between the subgroups for the different clinical
   features was performed and suggested no statistically significant
   differences, These results are not unexpected, because the two common
   mutations for Apert syndrome alter FGFR2 at adjacent amino acids that
   are likely to have similar biological, and therefore phenotypic,
   consequences.}},

Abstract = {{The perception of microtonal scales was investigated in a melodic
   identification task. In each trial, eight pure tones, equally spaced in
   log frequency in the vicinity of 700 Hz, were presented in one of nine
   different serial orders. There were two experiments, each with 108
   trials (six scales {[}tone sets] X nine serial orders X two
   repetitions). In each experiment, 30 subjects, half of whom were
   musically trained, were asked to match each melody to one of 9 visual
   representations (frequency-time grids). In Experiment 1, the six scales
   were spaced at intervals of 25, 33, 50, 67, 100, and 133 cents (100
   cents=1 semitone similar to 6\% of frequency). Performance was worse for
   scale steps of 25 and 33 cents than it was for wider scale steps. There
   were no significant effects at other intervals, including the interval
   of 100 cents, implying that melodic pattern identification is unaffected
   by long-term experience of music in 12-tone equally tempered tuning
   (e.g., piano music). In Experiment 2, the six scales were spaced at
   smaller intervals, of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 cents. Performance for
   the three narrower scale steps was worse than that for the three wider
   scale steps. For some orders, performance for the narrowest scale step
   (10 cents) did not exceed chance. The smallest practical scale step for
   short microtonal melodies in a pattern-identification task was estimated
   as being 10-20 cents for chance performance, and 30-40 cents for
   asymptotic performance.}},

Abstract = {{In a recent article, Stafford and Warr (1993) presented a
   reconceptualization of the deterrence doctrine where general deterrence
   is taken to be the result ofpersons' vicarious experiences. Such
   vicarious experiences include, among other things knowledge of the
   criminal activity of others and the consequences or lack of consequences
   of that activity. Specific deterrence is taken to be the result of
   persons' own personal experiences. These personal experiences include,
   among other things, own experience with punishment and punishment
   avoidance. In their reconceptualized deterrence theory, persons may
   concurrently be subject to both general and specific deterrent effects,
   some persons may be affected more by one type of deterrence than the
   other and the two types of deterrent effects may reinforce one another
   In addition, they argue that their version of deterrence theory promises
   some insight into current controversies in the literature. In this
   article, the authors first review and expand Stafford and Warr's
   reconceptualization of deterrence, and then subject some central
   hypotheses to empirical test. Although the authors' data are modest and
   cannot test all of the implications of Stafford and Warr's argument, the
   findings indicate that Stafford and Warr's reconceptualization promises
   to be a fruitful line of inquiry for those interested in the development
   of deterrence theory.}},

Abstract = {{Although there have been a number of reports correlating cellular GSH
   levels with cytotoxicity of platinum agents, none has examined the
   relationship between GSH concentrations and cytotoxicity. In this study,
   using a highly specific HPLC method for measuring GSH and expressing GSH
   as concentration and also per cell number, we evaluated the correlation
   between GSH levels and the cytotoxicity to five agents in ten human
   tumor cell lines. The five platinum agents included the platinum(II)
   complexes cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin and platinum(IV)
   complexes iproplatin and tetraplatin. The correlation between
   intracellular GSH concentration and cytotoxicity was highly significant
   only for iproplatin (P = 0.002) followed by tetraplatin, which
   demonstrated a trend toward statistical significance (P = 0.06).
   Cytotoxicity of the other platinum complexes showed no relation to GSH
   concentration, cisplatin itself showing a P-value of 0.09. In contrast,
   the GSH levels normalized to cell number showed a statistically
   significant correlation with the cytotoxicity of four of the five
   platinum agents, the exception being carboplatin; the strongest
   correlation observed was that for iproplatin and tetraplatin.
   Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity in these cell lines showed no
   correlation with cytotoxicity of any of the platinum complexes. Our
   results, from the analyses of both GSH concentration as well as GSH per
   cell number, suggest a significantly higher interaction between GSH and
   iproplatin compared with the other platinum agents. Moreover, our data
   suggest that relationships between cytotoxicity and GSH levels on a
   per-cell basis may not persist when differences in cell volume are taken
   into account.}},

   THE MANAGEMENT OF DIASTOLIC HYPERTENSION}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To compare the management of mild diastolic hypertension (90
   to 104 mm Hg) using a nonpharmacologic intervention with that using
   propranolol or placebo.
   DESIGN: Randomized, placebo-controlled trial with a 2 x 2 factorial
   design.
   SETTING: University-based ambulatory care center.
   PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred seven men and 105 women, 22 to 59 years of
   age, 73\% white, who had mild diastolic hypertension untreated for at
   least eight weeks.
   INTERVENTIONS: 1) a multicomponent lifestyle modification intervention
   (lifestyle focus group, or LFG) administered in eight weekly meetings +
   placebo, 2) LFG + propranolol, 3) propranolol alone, and 4) placebo
   alone, followed for 12 months.
   MEASUREMENTS: Systolic blood pressure (SEP), diastolic blood pressure
   (DBP), and self-reported adverse effects at each of nine follow-up
   visits; fasting total cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose at
   baseline and 12 months; 24-hour urine sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+),
   three-day food records and physical activity questionnaire at three and
   12 months; and a quality of life questionnaire at 12 months.
   MAIN RESULTS: The mean decreases in DBP at 12 months were: 8.5 mm Hg in
   the LFG + propranolol group; 7.7 mm Hg in the propranolol-only group;
   5.9 mm Hg in the placeboonly group; and 5.4 mm Hg in the LFG + placebo
   group. Repeated-measures analysis of covariance showed that level of
   baseline DBP (p < 0.0001), time of follow-up (p < 0.0001), and
   propranolol use (p < 0.0001) were significantly associated with a
   decrease in DBP at 12 months. Despite reductions in urinary Na+ (-35
   mEq; 95\% CI = -50, -19), dietary Na+ (-521 mg; 95\% CI = -710, -332),
   total calories ingested (-238; 95\% Cl = -335, -140), and weight (-1.4
   Ib; 95\% CI = -3.7, +0.8), and significant increases in dietary K+ (+294
   mg; 95\% CI = +107, +480) and in mets-minutes of exercise (+43; 95\% CI
   = +20, +67) at three months, assignment to the LFG intervention had no
   effect on DBP at three or 12 months. The subjects assigned to take
   propranolol more frequently reported fatigue during ordinary activities,
   sleep disturbance, decrease in sexual activity, and depressed feelings,
   when compared with the subjects taking placebo, but the numbers of study
   withdrawals did not differ by drug assignment, No significant difference
   in total cholesterol and glucose levels was observed by group
   assignment. Triglycerides increased significantly in the subjects
   assigned to propranolol (mean difference = +20 mg/dL; 95\% CI of
   difference +1.5, +39). There was no difference in the responses to 21
   quality of life items between the subjects assigned to propranolol and
   those assigned to placebo.
   CONCLUSIONS: This multicomponent lifestyle modification intervention was
   unable to promote persistent behavior changes and thus was inferior to
   propranolol therapy for the treatment for mild diastolic hypertension.
   Future research should focus on single modifiable factors to lower blood
   pressure.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. Cartilage loss is central to the development of joint failure
   in arthritis, However, radiographic assessment of cartilage loss is
   highly unreliable. This study examined the accuracy and reproducibility
   of a noninvasive technique for quantifying the volume of articular
   cartilage in the metacarpophalangeal joints of the hand by use of
   three-dimensional (3D) MR imaging.
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Eight metacarpophalangeal joints (four normal, one
   rheumatoid arthritic, and three normal cadaveric) each were imaged three
   times with a 1.5-T clinical MR imaging scanner with a small partial
   volume coil and a fat-saturated 3D spoiled gradient-echo sequence
   optimized for delineating articular cartilage. The volumes of cartilage
   over the metacarpal and phalangeal surfaces were quantified by summing
   the voxels within segmented 3D reconstructions of the images. Cartilage
   volumes in the three cadaver joints also were estimated by scraping
   cartilage off the articular surfaces and measuring water displacement in
   graduated cylinders. These values were used as the gold standard for
   assessing the accuracy of cartilage volume quantification by MR imaging.
   RESULTS. The fat-saturated sequence discriminated the articular
   cartilage from adjacent joint structures with high contrast and high
   spatial resolution, Cartilage volumes determined by MR imaging for the
   different subjects ranged from 115 mu l to 222 mu l for metacarpal
   cartilage and from 34 mu l to 86 mu l for proximal phalangeal cartilage.
   Accuracy errors for quantifying cartilage volume by MR imaging were
   -1.8\% (95\% confidence interval, -3.5\% to -0.7\%) for metacarpal
   cartilage and 9.1\% (4.3\% to 14.7\%) for proximal phalangeal cartilage.
   Reproducibility errors were 5.2\% (95\% confidence interval, 2.9\% to
   7.6\%) and 9.9\% (5.4\% to 15.1\%), respectively.
   CONCLUSION. Fat-suppressed T1-weighted 3D MR imaging provides sufficient
   contrast and spatial resolution to allow accurate and reproducible
   quantification of articular cartilage volume in the metacarpophalangeal
   joints of the hand. This technique may be useful for monitoring
   cartilage loss in patients with arthritis.}},

Abstract = {{We examined temporal effects of estradiol (E(2)) and progesterone on
   cellular levels of LHRH messenger RNA (mRNA) in several brain regions.
   Female rats were ovariectomized and implanted with SILASTIC brand
   capsules of oil or E(2) 1 week later (day 0). Progesterone capsules were
   implanted on the morning of day 2. Using in situ hybridization
   histochemistry, we found that on day 2, E(2) induced a complex temporal
   pattern of changes in LHRH mRNA levels. Levels in ovariectomized
   E(2)-treated animals were lower than control values in the morning, then
   increased before the LH surge and declined again as the surge waned. The
   magnitude of these changes was greatest in neurons of the rostral
   preoptic area/organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis, but a similar
   pattern was detected in neurons of the medial preoptic area. No changes
   were seen in neurons of the diagonal band of Broca. Our finding that the
   effect of E(2) on LHRH mRNA levels depends on the time of day and brain
   region examined largely reconciles discrepancies among previous studies.
   Progesterone triggered events that advanced the onset of and augmented
   the LH surge, but had no effect on LHRH mRNA levels. These findings
   support the hypothesis that the mechanism by which E(2) induces
   region-specific changes in LHRH mRNA levels before the surge is separate
   from the progesterone-amplified mechanism that induces LHRH release.}},

   methods proposed in this paper have been investigated for a purpose of
   transmission of a coded image and restoration again without a large loss
   of an original image information. Each neuron circuit of a network
   receives one pixel of an input image, and processes it with binary
   outputs data fed from neighboring neuron circuits. Parallel dynamics
   quantization methods have been adopted for image coding methods. They
   are performed in networks to decide an output binary value of each
   neuron circuit according to output values of neighboring neuron
   circuits. Delayed binary outputs of neuron circuits in a neighborhood
   are directly connected to inputs of a current active neuron circuit.
   Next state of a network is computed from a current state at some neuron
   circuits in any time interval. Models of two types of neuron circuits
   and networks are presented and simulated to confirm an ability of
   proposed methods. Also, physical layout designs of coding chips have

Abstract = {{A temperature jump (T-jump) method capable of initiating thermally
   induced processes on the picosecond time scale in aqueous solutions is
   introduced. Protein solutions are heated by energy from a laser pulse
   that is absorbed by homogeneously dispersed molecules of the dye crystal
   violet. These act as transducers by releasing the energy as heat to
   cause a T-jump of up to 10 K with a time resolution of 70 ps, The method
   was applied to the unfolding of RNase A. At pH 5.7 and 59 degrees C, a
   T-jump of 3-6 K induced unfolding which was detected by picosecond
   transient infrared spectroscopy of the amide I region between 1600 and
   1700 cm(-1). The difference spectral profile at 3.5 ns closely resembled

   16330 cm(-1), corresponding to the beta-sheet structure, achieved 15 +/-
   2\% of the decrease found at equilibrium, within 5.5 ns. However, no
   decrease in absorbance was detected until 1 ns after the T-jump. The
   disruption of beta-sheet therefore appears to be subject to a delay of
   approximate to 1 ns. Prior to 1 ns after the T-jump, water might be

Abstract = {{An analysis of spiral tip trajectories by complex Fast Fourier Transform
   (FFT) is presented. The trajectories are obtained from the numerical
   integration of partial differential equations describing the Oregonator
   model of an excitable medium. Their analysis shows: (1) There are
   regions in the (epsilon, f) parameter space of the model where for a
   given epsilon and increasing f up to four frequency branches appear. The
   frequencies of these branches determine the coarse structure and
   geometry of the pattern, i.e., the number and the size of their loops,
   and are called `'structural'' frequencies. Other frequencies of the
   spectra are related with the detailed shape of the loops. (2) The
   interplay of up to four structural frequencies generates regular
   trajectories of high complexity but no sign of chaos has been found. (3)
   The spiral wave outside the core region is independent of the complexity
   of the tip trajectory. It is solely determined by the structural Fourier
   component with frequency upsilon and amplitude r that has the highest
   circular speed c = 2 pi r upsilon.}},

Abstract = {{Cytoplasmic calcium fluctuations were studied in calcium overloaded
   Xenopus oocytes. Calcium sensitive chloride currents were recorded using
   the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. Fluctuations of chloride
   currents measured under the voltage clamp were elicited by injection of
   calcium into the cytoplasm. Contrary to infrequent injections of small
   calcium amounts which evoke smooth transient responses, the fluctuating
   chloride currents are due to overloading of intracellular calcium stores
   which then release calcium repeatedly. Chloride current fluctuations in
   calcium overloaded oocytes can be reversibly suppressed by caffeine.
   This effect is concentration dependent, and the amplitude decrease of
   fluctuations is already apparent at 2 mmol/l caffeine. Power spectra
   density of fluctuations have been analyzed; they exhibited this
   pronounced effect of caffeine. Other effective inhibitors were
   tetracaine and heparin. The results of the present work suggest that at
   least a part of the endoplasmic reticulum in Xenopus oocytes is a
   calcium releasing calcium stare which can be activated by calcium at the
   resting inositol trisphosphate concentration.}},

Abstract = {{The incidence rate per million population of treated end-stage renal
   disease (ESRD) has been increasing at similar rates in most countries
   that record counts of new ESRD patients per year. Data from the United
   States Renal Data System (USRDS) suggest an exponential growth for both
   incidence rates and prevalence rates. Doubling of the number of new
   patients per year occurred over a recent 8.5 year period, and this
   interval was even shorter for older patients, Asians, Native Americans
   and for patients with diabetes or hypertension as cause of ESRD. Reasons
   for this growth in incidence include greater acceptance to therapy of
   older and sicker patients, reduced mortality from other conditions and
   possibly more kidney disease. A recent reduction in mortality rates for
   ESRD patients in the US has additionally influenced the growth in
   prevalence. In view of these striking recent trends a prognosis for the
   next decade is discussed. As major possible solutions prevention efforts
   for renal disease and for the progression of renal disease are proposed,

   demographic and cultural change but also the influence of social
   organization and lordship. Whilst social diffusion was important in the
   changing patterns of naming, there were differences in the reception of
   change within social groups, illustrated most importantly for the unfree

Abstract = {{Assessment of changes in surface ocean conditions, in particular,
   sea-surface temperature (SST), is essential to understand long-term
   changes in climate especially in regions where continental climate is
   strongly influenced by oceanographic processes. To evaluate changes in
   SST in the northeast Pacific, we have analyzed long-chain alkenones of
   prymnesiophyte origin at 38 depths in a piston and associated trigger
   core collected beneath the contemporary core of the California Current
   System at, 42 degrees N, similar to 270 km off the coast of
   Oregon/California. The samples span 30,000 years of deposition at this
   location. Unsaturation patterns (U-37(k')) in the alkenone series
   display a statistically significant difference (p << 0.001) between
   interglacial (0.44 +/- 0.02, n = 11) and glacial (0.29 +/- 0.04, n = 20)
   intervals of the cores. Detailed examination of other compositional
   features of the C-37, C-38, C-39 alkenone series and a related C-36
   alkenoate series measured downcore suggests the published U-37(k') -
   temperature calibration (U(37)k' = 0.034 x T + 0.039) defined for
   cultures of a strain of Emiliania huxleyi isolated from the subarctic
   Pacific, provides best estimates of winter SST at our study site. This
   inference is purely statistical and does not imply, however, that the
   phytoplankton source of these biomarkers is most productive in winter or
   at the ocean surface. The temperature record for U(37)k' implies (1) an
   similar to 4 degrees C shift occurred in winter SST from similar to 7.5
   +/- 1.1 degrees C at the last glacial maximum to similar to 11.7 +/- 0.7
   degrees C in the present interglacial period, and (2) this warming trend
   was confined to the time frame 14-10 Ka within the glacial to
   interglacial transition period. These conclusions are corroborated
   entirely by results from an independent SST transformation of
   radiolarian species assemblage data obtained from the same core
   materials.}},

Abstract = {{It has been reported that single stranded viral DNA reacts with the
   carcinogen, chloroacetaldehyde at specific hot spots (Premaratne et al,
   1993 Int. J. Biochem. 25, 1669-1672). We tested this occurrence with
   several other mutagens and potential carcinogens. A series of chemicals
   (chloroacetaldehyde, methyl, ethyl, and propyl nitro nitrosoguanidine,
   hydrazine, 2,4 dinitrophenyl hydrazine, hydroxylamine and methyl
   methanesulfonate) were each separately reacted with viral M13mp18 DNA
   for 2 hr at 37 degrees C and pH 4.9. The locations of adduction were
   identified as points of chain termination (or polymerase fall off) when
   the reacted DNA was subjected to a modified sequencing procedure that
   had ample regular labeled and unlabeled nucleotides but lacked dideoxy
   chain termination mixtures. Chain termination was observed to occur at
   specific, non-random, sites rather than with equal probability at all
   bases of the DNA. Chemicals with similar structures had identical points
   of `'fall off''. The pattern of chain termination appears to be unique
   to each class of compounds and is independent of temperature, pH, and
   salt concentration. Termination is believed to occur when the DNA
   polymerase encounters an adduct. Mutagens of different unrelated
   structures when reacted with this DNA produced different sites of adduct
   formation, while the alkyl nitro nitrosoguanidines, compounds with
   homologous structure showed identical points of chain termination.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual dimorphism in body size and leg length was investigated in a
   common orb-weaving spider of Ireland and northern Europe, Metellina
   segmentata (Clerck, 1757) (Araneae, Metidae). Univariate and
   multivariate analyses of sexual dimorphism revealed that a greater
   proportion of between sex variation (sexual dimorphism) was attributable
   to variation in shape than in size. Significant differences were found
   in the scores for males and females for the first two principal
   components. PC1 (shape) accounted for 44.25\% of the variation and PC2
   (size) 13.01\% of the variation. Although M. segmentata has been
   attributed with minimal sexual size dimorphism, females were markedly
   heavier, possibly a reflection of differential reproductive investment
   between the sexes, but males had markedly longer legs and broader
   prosoma. The results are discussed with regard to existing theories of
   natural and sexual selection, particularly those concerning sexual
   cannibalism and differential life history traits in males and females.
   Models that attempt to explain the evolution of sexual size dimorphism
   in spiders and of the web builders in particular, fail to account for
   the multivariate nature of dimorphism, especially with respect to shape.

Abstract = {{To investigate the concept that the initial treatment of hypertension
   with low doses of two antihypertensives that have different modes of
   action and additive effects may achieve control of blood pressure and
   minimize the dose-dependent adverse effects seen with conventional
   monotherapy, a randomized, double-blind parallel group dose-escalation
   study was conducted. After a 4 to 5 week placebo washout period, 218 men
   and women with diastolic blood pressure between 95 and 114 mm Hg were
   randomly allocated to take: amlodipine (2.5 to 10 mg), enalapril (5 to
   20 mg), and the low-dose combination of bisoprolol (2.5 to 10 mg) with
   6.25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). All drugs were administered once
   daily, titrated to optimal response, and taken for a total of 12 weeks.
   Blood pressure was measured 24 hours after dose. The response rates
   (either a diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 90 mm Hg or a
   decrease of diastolic pressure greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg) were
   71\% for bisoprolol-6.25 mg HCTZ, 69\% for amlodipine, and 45\% for
   enalapril. The mean decreases in systolic/diastolic blood pressure from
   baseline were 13.4/10.7, 12.8/10.2, and 7.3/6.6 mm Hg for
   bisoprolol-6.25 mg HCTZ, amlodipine, and enalapril, respectively. The
   mean change with enalapril was less than the other drugs (p < 0.01),
   although the once-daily dosing of enalapril and the maximum dose of 20
   mg might not have been optimal for this agent. Overall adverse events
   for bisoprolol-6.25 mg HCTZ, amlodipine, and enalapril were 29\%, 42\%,
   and 47\% (p = 0.04, bisoprolol-6.25 mg HCTZ vs enalapril), and
   drug-related adverse events were 16\%, 21\%, and 23\% (no significant
   difference), respectively. Changes in quality of life scores as measured
   by the General Well-Being Index were +0.9 for bisoprolol-6.25 mg HCTZ,
   +0.5 for amlodipine, and -2.3 for enalapril, with a positive change
   indicating improvement. This study demonstrates that low-dose
   combination therapy with bisoprolol-6.25 mg HCTZ is effective and well
   tolerated. Thus low-dose combination therapy appears to be a rational
   alternative for initiating therapy of mild to moderate hypertension.}},

   (ELVIS(TM)) EMPLOYING A GENETICALLY-MODIFIED CELL-LINE}},

Abstract = {{Background: Infections with herpes simplex viruses (HSV) are common and
   may cause severe disease in immunocompromised hosts and in neonates.
   Isolation of infectious HSV in tissue culture is the most sensitive
   method of detection, but is not the most rapid. Recently, however, an
   Enzyme-Linked Virus Inducible System(TM) (ELVIS(TM)) for rapid detection
   of HSV in culture has been developed. The system employs genetically
   engineered baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells (ELVIS(TM) cells) whose DNA
   bears an HSV inducible promoter gene chimerically linked to an E. coli
   LacZ `'reporter'' gene. Induction of the promoter by HSV leads to the
   production of LacZ product, beta-galactosidase, which is readily
   detected histochemically.
   Objective: To evaluate these ELVIS(TM) cells, as a test for HSV, in
   comparison with HSV detection in MRC-5 cells in shell vial cultures
   confirmed by staining with fluorescent antibodies.
   Study design: Over a period of one month, 167 specimens submitted to the
   laboratory for detection of HSV were evaluated. Specimens were
   inoculated onto MRC-5 cells growing on glass coverslips in each of two
   shell vials and into two wells of a 24-well cluster plate containing
   ELVIS(TM) cells. MRC-5 shell vial cultures were observed daily for cpe
   for up to 7 days. With the appearance of cpe, the coverslips were fixed
   and the cells were typed for HSV-1 and HSV-2 with monoclonal antibodies.
   Specimens inoculated onto ELVIS(TM) cells were incubated for 16-24 h,
   then substrate was added to stain for beta-galactosidase. ELVIS(TM)
   cells, induced by HSV infection to express beta-galactosidase, stained
   blue upon reaction with substrate.
   Results: Of 167 specimens inoculated onto MRC-5 cells, 13 were excluded
   because of contamination or toxicity. Among the remaining 154 specimens,
   24 were positive for HSV in the MRC-5 shell vials. Of 166 specimens
   inoculated into the ELVIS(TM) cells, all were completed within 24 h.
   Twenty-three (23) of the 24 shell-vial-positive cultures also were
   positive on the ELVIS(TM) cells. All 23 specimens detected in the
   ELVIS(TM) cells were positive within 24 h, whereas only nine were
   positive within 24 hours in MRC-5 shell vial cultures. The remaining 15
   became positive after 24 h. Specimens positive for viruses other than
   HSV-1 or HSV-2 were not positive on the ELVIS(TM) cells.
   Conclusions: The ELVIS(TM) assay for HSV is simple to perform, is rapid,
   sensitive, and specific. The assay detects both HSV-1 and HSV-2. No
   antibodies are required unless typing,which can be done on the ELVIS(TM)
   cells, is necessary.}},

   electrodeposition on gold foils, and those of 96.3\% enriched
   (SrCO3)-Sr-86 via sedimentation on Cu backing. The radioactivity of the
   activation products was determined via high resolution gamma-ray
   spectrometry. Statistical model calculations taking into account
   preequilibrium effects were performed for the experimentally measured
   competing reactions induced by protons on the target nuclei Ni-64,
   Kr-78, and Sr-86. The strong (p, n) channel is described well by the
   calculation. In the case of weaker channels some discrepancies occurred
   between the experimental and theoretical data, in particular for Kr-78
   as target. Regarding the (p, alpha) process, an attempt was made to
   include direct three-nucleon pickup component. For the neutron deficient
   target nuclei Kr-78 and Sr-86 the direct reaction contribution to the
   (p,alpha) cross section appears to be small, presumably due to large (p,
   n) thresholds. Inclusion of this component in the (p,alpha) reaction on
   the neutron rich target nuclide Ni-64, however, led to a better
   agreement between the experimental and theoretical data.}},

Abstract = {{The cytotoxic interaction between cloned human Natural Killer (NK) cells
   and K562 target cells was studied using confocal laser scanning
   microscopy (CLSM) and conventional fluorescence microscopy, We observed,
   using fixed as well as living cells, the occurrence of
   (pseudo)emperipolesis during the interaction. About 30\% of conjugated
   NK cells penetrated, partly or completely, into the target cells
   (in-conjugation). Virtually all in-conjugated target cells exhibited
   polymerized actin, Killer cells of in-conjugates were frequently seen
   approaching the target cell nucleus or aligning along it, If the
   cytotoxic process was inhibited by the absence of calcium neither actin
   polymerization nor in-conjugation were observed. A kinetic study showed
   that in-conjugation starts somewhat later than actin polymerization but
   still within a few minutes after addition of calcium to conjugates
   previously formed in the absence of calcium, The presence of
   cytochalasin D (an inhibitor of actin polymerization) completely
   inhibited in-conjugation and partly reduced the cytotoxic activity. Zinc
   ions (endonuclease inhibition) inhibited in-conjugation and decreased
   the total number of target cells with polymerized actin in a
   concentration dependent manner, Cytotoxic activity was also reduced but
   not as efficiently as in-conjugation.
   Our study demonstrates that in-conjugation represents a significant
   fraction of the cytotoxic interaction. The results indicate that it may
   be a consequence of an actin polymerization and endonuclease activity
   dependent part of a cytotoxic mechanism. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& Aims: Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a major agent of seafood
   gastroenteritis that induces intestinal secretion in the rabbit through
   its thermostable direct hemolysin. The aim of this study was to
   characterize the enterotoxicity of purified hemolysin in vitro. Methods:
   Rabbit ileum was mounted in Ussing chambers, and changes in potential
   difference and short-circuit current were monitored after addition of
   hemolysin. Intracellular calcium concentrations in the nontumoral rat
   crypt-derived cell line IEC-6 were measured using
   microspectrofluorometry. Results: In Ussing chamber experiments, mucosal
   toxin addition up to 50 hemolytic units per milliliter induced a
   proportional increase of the electrical parameters in normal but not
   Cl--free Ringer's solution. The response to the toxin was not additive
   to that of calcium ionophore A23187 and was eliminated by preloading the
   tissue with 1-2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid
   (BAPTA), a calcium buffer. In IEC-6 cells, a 10-fold increase in
   intracellular calcium level was found after addition of hemolysin. Such
   an increase was totally quenched by BAPTA. Finally, preincubation with
   trisialoganglioside GT1b, but not monosialoganglioside GM1, eliminated

Abstract = {{Background and Study Aims: To date there is no information available on
   whether drugs that are commonly used in premedication for colonoscopy
   procedures, such as diazepam and pethidine, may activate intestinal mast
   cells and thereby give rise to adverse effects. Since opioids such as
   pethidine are well-known for their ability to induce histamine release
   from several mast cell subtypes, the present study investigated the
   effect of diazepam and pethidine, intravenously administered as
   premedication for colonoscopy, on mast cell mediator secretion from
   colonic and rectal mucosa.
   Patients and Methods: The secretion of the mast cell mediators histamine
   and tryptase was followed from biopsies of patients with and without
   premedication for 30 minutes in an air-bubbled incubation medium (mucosa
   oxygenation). The mediator release and tissue histamine content were
   studied prospectively in 17 control persons (histologically normal
   mucosa) as well as in 71 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
   (histologically uninvolved and involved tissue).
   Results: Although a significant accumulation of histamine was found in
   inflamed IBD-tissue, the results indicate, however, that this
   premedication does not enhance the release of histamine or tryptase from
   gut mucosal samples, neither in the histologically normal mucosa of
   control persons nor in tissue unaffected or affected by inflammatory
   bowel disease.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates that colonoscopy premedication with
   diazepam and pethidine is safe in terms of gut mucosal mast cell
   activation.}},

Abstract = {{Current seismic provisions require that shear links in eccentrically
   braced frames be fully welded to the column flanges at the link-column
   joint. Since field welding may have its disadvantages, the use of bolted
   extended end-plate connection is examined. An experimental program is
   conducted to assess the response of extended end-plate connections of
   link-column joints in eccentrically braced frames. Six link-column joint
   specimens are tested using a cyclic load that represents the severe load
   reversals that the frame may be subjected to during strong earthquakes.
   The specimens are selected on the basis of different connection designs.
   Measurements of forces, strains, and displacements are made. Interaction
   curves relating the shear force acid moment acting on links with
   semirigid connections are developed. The slip tendency and energy
   dissipation capacity of the different specimens are compared. On the
   basis of the test results, a design procedure is developed for the
   bolted extended end-plate link-column connection. It is concluded that
   bolted extended end-plate connections can be used for link-column joints
   of eccentrically braced frames. In properly designed connections bolt
   slippage was not measured even at high shear forces that are
   characteristic of link-column joint. Existing guidelines for the design
   of extended end-plate link-column joints are modified to account for the

Abstract = {{The crystal structure of the self-complementary decamer
   d(CCIGGCCm(5)CGG), where I and m(5)C replace A and T, respectively, in

   conformation. Furthermore, the A-DNA duplex exhibits the unexpected
   wobble I . m(5)C+ base pairs with N3 of 5-methylcytosine protonated. The
   crystals belong to the orthorhombic system, space group P2(1)2(1)2(1),
   with a = 25.02, b = 44.95 and c = 47.62 Angstrom with one DNA duplex in
   the asymmetric unit. Intensity data were collected on our Siemens area
   detector to 1.6 Angstrom resolution. The structure was solved by the
   molecular placement method starting with a model from an isomorphous
   structure. The refinement gave a final R value of 16.3\% for 404 DNA
   atoms and 104 water molecules using 5119 reflections. The hydration of
   the I . m(5)C+ wobble base pairs in the major groove stabilizes them as
   in the G . T/G . U wobbles. A comparison with the Watson-Crick base
   pairs of another isomorphous structure d(GCGGGCCCGC) reveals that the
   wobble base pairs are better described by a rotation of the individual
   nucleotide units around their centers of gravity. This is in contrast to
   the earlier description of translation of the bases into the grooves.
   The exposed N4 amino group of 5-methylcytosine in the wobble base pair
   provides a rationale for its deamination to thymine.}},

Abstract = {{Stable Cl isotope ratios, measured in marine pore waters associated with
   the Barbados and Nankai subduction zones, extend significantly (to
   similar to -8 parts per thousand) the range of delta(37)Cl values
   reported for natural waters, These relatively large negative values,
   together with geologic and chemical evidence from Barbados and Nankai
   and recent laboratory data showing that hydrous silicate minerals (i.e.,
   those with structural OH sites) are enriched up to 7.5 parts per
   thousand in Cl-37 relative to seawater, strongly suggest that the
   isotopic composition of Cl in pore waters from subduction zones reflects
   diagenetic and metamorphic dehydration and transformation reactions,
   These reactions involve clays and/or other hydrous silicate phases at
   depth in the fluid source regions, Chlorine therefore cannot be
   considered geochemically conservative in these systems, The uptake of Cl
   by hydrous phases provides a mechanism by which Cl can be cycled into
   the mantle through subduction zones. Thus, stable Cl isotopes should
   help in determining the extent to which Cl and companion excess
   volatiles like H2O and CO2 cycle between the crust and mantle.}},

Abstract = {{For mapping and monitoring the spatial distribution of salt-affected
   soils using remote sensing data, a thorough understanding of their
   spectral behaviour is of paramount importance. The spectral behaviour of
   a few typical salt-affected soils of the Indo-Gangetic alluvial plain
   was studied by taking ground-based spectral measurements with the
   Exotech radiometer (model 100 EX) and measurements made by the thematic
   mapper (TM) onboard Landsat-5. Salt-affected soils, in general, showed
   relatively higher spectral response in the visible and near-infrared
   regions of the spectrum as compared to normal cultivated soils. Further,
   strongly saline-sodic soils were found to have higher spectral response
   as compared to moderately saline-sodic soils. The vegetation cover
   modifies the overall spectral response pattern of salt-affected soils
   especially in the green and red spectral bands. In addition, variation
   in the Sun elevation angle and moisture content were also found to
   modify the observed spectral response of salt-affected soils.

   confirms the strong hydrogen bonding in this crystal. Broad bands

Abstract = {{Most neutron interferometric experiments carried out up till now have
   dealt with fundamental physics applications. But it was known from the
   beginning that the interferometric method can open new horizons for
   solid state physics research as well. Samples with density or magnetic
   fluctuations cause inhomogeneous phase shifts which cause a measurable
   loss of contrast of the interference pattern. Phase topography can be
   realized without absorbing or scattering neutrons at the object. Very
   small energy changes (down to 10(-17) eV) become measurable by means of
   the magnetic neutron Josephson effect. By measuring the neutron
   coherence function, one gets direct access to the correlation function

Abstract = {{A camera is mounted on a moving robot and can rotate, relative to the
   robot, about two axes. We show how the optical now field can be used to
   control the camera's motion to keep a target at the center of the
   camera's field of view, but that this is not always possible when the
   target lies close to the plane defined by the camera's two axes of
   rotation.
   When the target is held at the center of the camera's field of view,
   then the magnitude of the camera's angular velocity about one axis never
   exceeds the magnitude of the flow vector associated with the target, but
   the angular velocity about the other axis is dependent on the inverse
   distance of the target from this axis, and hence can became large as
   this distance becomes small. Situations, where the magnitudes of the
   camera's angular velocity and acceleration become large, are considered
   in the special case where the relative motion between the robot and its
   environment is purely translational. The tracking strategy is
   experimentally evaluated using computer-generated optical flow fields.}},

Abstract = {{The motion of a light particle in a solid coupled to conduction
   electrons and/or phonons is investigated within the framework of a
   two-state model, which may be taken as representing the particle ground
   states in two neighbouring potential wells. With regard to the coupling
   of the particle to phonons, an important distinction arises between (i)
   special two-phonon processes, termed diphonon processes, which result
   from nonlinear particle-lattice coupling and which may give rise to
   qunsielastic phase-destroying scattering and (ii) essentially inelastic
   processes which may arise from linear as well as from nonlinear
   particle-lattice coupling.
   An important parameter affecting particle motion is the static energy
   shift epsilon between the particle ground states in the two wells. Under
   favourable conditions it may be experimentally controlled within certain
   limits. The two-state model allows us to estimate reliably the boundary
   in the E-T plane separating the regimes of incoherent hopping from that
   of coherent bandlike motion, and to discuss its dependence on the
   particle mass and the coupling parameters. Within the regime of
   incoherent motion a number of subregimes may exist. The situation
   becomes particularly interesting if a condensation of the electron
   system takes place, as in the case of a Bardeen-Copper-Schriefer
   superconductor. Then domains have to be distinguished in which the
   hopping rates are dominated by either quasiparticle coupling, diphonon
   processes, one-phonon processes, Cooper-pair breaking, coupling to
   normal-conducting electrons, or multiphonon-assisted processes.
   In the series of light particles carrying one positive elementary
   charge, which includes the positive muon (mu(+)) and the nuclei of the
   hydrogen isotopes, the range of validity,of the two-state description
   extends to rather high temperatures for the mu(+) but only to
   considerably lower temperatures for the heavier particles. Nevertheless,
   for protons the limiting temperature can be almost as high as the Debye
   temperature. Towards low temperatures the validity of the two-well
   description of unrestricted particle motion in a crystal is limited by
   the onset of coherent motion.}},

Abstract = {{Proteins expressed specifically in neurons and transported to synaptic
   terminals are likely to constitute important molecular elements of
   nervous system function. In an effort to characterize synapse-associated
   proteins (SAPs) of Drosophila, we have isolated from a hybridoma library
   several monoclonal antibodies (MABs) that selectively stain synaptic
   terminals in immunohistochemical preparations. MAB nc46 binds to most
   but not all synaptic terminals of the Drosophila nervous system, it also
   recognizes a protein with homologous distribution in other dipteran
   flies and binds to large parts of fish CNS. In Western blots the
   antibody labels a Drosophila brain protein of 47 kDa and cross-reacts
   with brain proteins from several species including insects, fish, mouse
   and man. From these data we conclude that the corresponding gene has
   been conserved in evolution at least among diptera. Using MAB nc46 and
   expression cloning we have identified the `sap47' gene coding for the
   `synapse-associated protein of 47 kDa' of Drosophila melanogaster.
   Sequence analysis of genomic and cDNA clones reveals the intron-exon
   structure of the gene and characterizes the complete open reading frames
   of two alternatively spliced transcripts. The sap47 gene is located in
   89A8-B3 on chromosome 3R and codes for two almost identical inferred
   polypeptides of 347 and 351 amino acids with no significant sequence
   homology to known proteins.}},

Abstract = {{Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) plays a crucial role in
   controlling the ovarian cycle in women. By modification of the molecular
   structure of this decapeptide, analogues were synthesized with agonistic
   or antagonistic effects on the gonadotrophic cells of the anterior
   pituitary gland. The agonists, after an initial stimulatory effect
   ('flare up'), lead to desensitization of the gonadotrophic cells and a
   reduction in the number of LHRH receptors on the cell membrane
   ('down-regulation'), while the antagonists produce an immediate effect
   by competitive blockade of the LHRH receptors. After administration of
   LHRH antagonists, the serum levels of FSH and LH decrease within hours.
   Nevertheless, the adenohypophysis maintains its responsiveness to an
   LHRH stimulus ('pituitary response') after pretreatment with an
   antagonist. This different pharmacological mechanism of LHRH antagonists
   makes possible new approaches to ovarian stimulation and to the therapy
   of sex steroid dependent diseases. The premature LH surge, the main
   cause of cancellation during induction of superovulation in assisted
   reproduction technology (ART) programmes, can be abolished by short term
   application of an LHRH antagonist associated with a reduced human
   menopausal gonadotrophin (HMG) requirement for ovarian stimulation. A
   future approach to ART might be based on the combination of pretreatment
   with an LHRH antagonist and ovulation induction by native LHRH or an
   agonist. The severe side effects encountered with early LHRH
   antagonists, such as anaphylactoid reactions due to histamine release,
   are almost completely eliminated in modern antagonists, especially
   Cetrorelix which is presently used clinically in controlled phase II
   clinical studies.}},

   evaluated in CD-1 mice by injecting the antisera 3 h before intravenous
   (i.v.) LPS (600 mu g). Implantable radiotransmitters were used for
   continuous monitoring of temperature. No decrease in mortality was
   observed, and the anti-TNF failed to prevent the drop in temperature. In
   BALB\textbackslash{}c mice injected with antisera before LPS (200 mu g)
   mortality was reduced (dead/total: control sera, 14/14; anti-TNF, 4/12;
   p = .007 control sera vs. anti-TNF). CD-1 mice were pretreated with

   sequestration, improve survival, or prevent the decrease in temperature
   observed as sepsis developed. CLP was performed in the
   BALB\textbackslash{}c mice using antibiotics plus anti-TNF antisera, but
   no protection was observed. Our results demonstrate that anti-TNF
   treatment prevents LPS mortality only when using certain strains of mice
   and inhibition of TNF fails to reduce mortality in a more clinically

   The other end of the tube was rotated through a chosen angle and the

   vacuum system were registered. It was found that the gas release
   occurred only if the limit of elasticity was exceeded. The amount of gas
   released increased with increasing deformation and also with increasing
   temperature. The exposure of the inner surface to gas at higher pressure
   had no measurable effect for H-2, O-2, H2O and CO. Displacement of

Abstract = {{Atrial reentry tachycardia, often termed atrial flutter, is an
   arrhythmia that is uncommon in the general pediatric population but is
   seen frequently in patients with congenital heart disease. One goal in
   treating the arrhythmia is to terminate it, returning the atrium to its
   underlying rhythm. This report describes the use of transesophageal
   atrial pacing to attempt termination of atrial reentry in 102 pediatric
   patients (158 episodes). The patients ranged in age from 1 hour to 41.5
   years. Conversion was successful for 112 (71\%) of 158 episodes. Six of
   the 112 episodes required an infusion of procainamide after initial
   attempts at pacing led to atrial fibrillation. There were no significant
   differences between the ages of patients or the duration of the
   tachycardia in comparing successful versus unsuccessful conversions. In
   contrast, the atrial cycle lengths for the successfully converted
   tachycardias were significantly greater than for unsuccessful attempts.
   Transesophageal atrial pacing is a safe and effective means of
   terminating atrial flutter in the pediatric population. It is minimally
   invasive, it can often be performed in an outpatient setting, and the
   technique may occasionally be facilitated by infusion of intravenous
   procainamide.}},

Abstract = {{The writing of a reflective diary is viewed as an effective tool for
   promoting reflection and learning in students, and for self-assessment
   and evaluation of a clinical learning experience. This work is a study
   of 30 undergraduate nurses and their use of reflective diaries during a
   period of community health care practice. The theoretical basis of the
   study is based on Schon's work on reflection-in-action. The research
   tool, developed for the study of nursing practice by Powell, is based on
   Mezirow's levels of reflectivity. The findings are that, in the sample
   used, students do reflect on their practice according to Mezirow's
   levels of reflectivity, but that the highest number of reflections occur
   at the lower levels of reflectivity (94\% of the total number of
   scores). However, although only 6\% of the total number of scores were
   found at the higher levels of reflectivity, some 22 of the sample of 30
   students did attain conceptual acid theoretical reflectivity, the
   highest levels of reflectivity.}},

Abstract = {{Current therapeutic options for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent
   diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) focus on regimens that primarily lower fasting
   blood glucose concentrations. In several short-term studies, the
   alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, acarbose, has been reported to
   significantly lower postprandial plasma glucose levels as well as
   HbA(1c). The primary objective of this present study was to assess the
   long-term efficacy of adjunctive acarbose therapy to improve metabolic
   control. Over a 1-y period, acarbose or placebo was administered to 4
   groups of patients: those managed by diet only, diet and sulfonylurea,
   diet and biguanide, and diet and insulin. In all treatment groups, the
   addition of acarbose resulted in significant reductions in postprandial
   blood glucose levels. Additionally, HbA(1C) was significantly lower
   after 12 months of acarbose therapy compared with placebo, in all groups
   except the diet and insulin group. The addition of acarbose consequently
   expands the armamentarium available to clinicians for the optimization
   of glycemic control in patients with NIDDM.}},

Abstract = {{Current postulates support the idea that MS is triggered by an
   infectious agent or agents through an autoimmune reaction directed
   against brain antigens in genetically susceptible individuals. Evidence
   for an infectious etiology of MS is indirect. We have proposed that MS
   may, in some instances, be due to a zoonotic infection and that canine
   distemper virus, a measles-like virus in dogs, is a likely candidate in
   the causation of this disorder. The high homology between canine
   distemper and measles virus proteins has made it extremely difficult to
   distinguish distemper from measles antibodies serologically. We now
   provide evidence that humans can be infected with this neurotropic dog
   virus. Furthermore, a high titer of canine distemper virus antibodies is
   significantly associated with MS. Identification of the etiologic agent
   in MS may lead to the elucidation of disease pathogenesis and to disease
   prevention through appropriate public health and vaccination programs.}},

   style, it was of interest to investigate whether these differences are
   also reflected in their respective HLA compositions. To this end, 132
   subjects of Ashkenazi and 113 individuals of Moroccan origin residing in
   Israel were tested and the results compared with data for other
   populations made available by the 11th International Histocompatibility
   Workshop. Comparison between their HLA profiles and those of non-Jews
   revealed that the Jewish groups in some aspects resembled one another
   but in others showed disparities. The dissimilarities between the
   various groups are expressed in terms of gene and haplotype frequencies,
   as well as in HLA-disease associations (as for example rheumatoid
   arthritis, erosive lichen planus, primary Sjogren's syndrome, pemphigus
   vulgaris). However, both Jewish groups shared some unique features with
   respect to HLA class II allelic frequencies, pointing to a common
   ancestry.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. The purposes of this study were to delineate the normal
   anatomy and MR imaging features of the posterior intermalleolar
   ligament-a normal ligamentous variant of the posterior portion of the
   ankle-and to identify normal anatomic characteristics that may account
   for the role of the ligament in the development of posterior impingement
   syndrome.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS. The prevalence, size, and shape of the posterior
   intermalleolar ligament were documented in 36 cadaveric ankles and in 97
   MR studies of the ankle in patients with and without symptoms.
   RESULTS. The posterior intermalleolar ligament was identified in 20
   (56\%) of the 36 cadaveric feet, It was 1-8 mm wide, and its diameter
   (anterior to posterior) was 5-8 mm, The ligament often resembled a
   meniscus, and in one case its anterior lip herniated into the ankle
   joint. The posterior intermalleolar ligament was detected in 18 (19\%)
   of the 97 MR studies of the ankle. It was visualized on coronal T1- or
   T2-weighted images as a distinct, hypointense band traversing between
   the posterior talofibular ligament and the inferior transverse ligament.
   CONCLUSION. The posterior intermalleolar ligament is a normal variant of
   the posterior ligaments of the ankle and is present in a significant
   number of persons, It is best seen on coronal T1- and T2-weighted MR
   images. Its meniscuslike shape and occasional extension into the ankle
   joint may account for the development of posterior impingement syndrome
   in susceptible persons.}},

   treatment and efficient management. Assessment instruments for
   effectiveness and costs are essential to respond to these needs. The aim
   of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of treatments for
   major depressive disorders. We conducted a comparative pilot
   investigation of treatment costs in patients with a major depressive
   episode assigned to specialised out-patient crisis intervention, to
   specialised in-patient treatment and to standard mental hospital care.
   The study included 122 subjects. The inclusion criteron was a diagnosis
   of DSM-III-R major depressive episode. Costs were assessed by
   determining the average cost for each treatment and the modalities of
   payment systems. Treatment duration and costs were high, but specialised
   crisis intervention may considerably reduce the duration of
   hospitalisation and its associated costs. The average costs of treating
   major depression were about 4 times greater in the specialised hospital
   unit than in the standard hospital unit and the crisis intervention
   centre. The burden of payment was comparatively higher for the state and
   reduced for insurance companies when the treatment of major depressive
   disorders involved less in-patient care.}},

Abstract = {{A simple expression for the total energy of an RF pulse is given in

   found in the theory of nonlinear evolution equations. The simplicity of
   this expression enables the statement of a straightforward criterion for
   pulses that must have their energy reduced. It also allows the proof of
   some important theorems in pulse theory, including the known result that
   minimum-phase pulses are minimum energy pulses, and the previously
   unknown result that B-1-insensitive pulses must induce (possibly
   improper) bound states. A comparison of the energy require ments of
   minimum-phase and self-refocused pulses is given. Further,
   `'Butteworth'' pulses are compared to `'Chebyshev I'' pulses and found

Abstract = {{The trapping mechanism of hydrogen in niobium has been investigated
   within the molecular-dynamics approach. Simulations of the diffusion
   process of this impurity were performed in which Nb-Nb interaction was
   described by an N-body potential. The potential parameters were adjusted
   with respect to static and dynamic properties of a Nb crystal. Nb-H
   interaction was represented by a two-body potential. The Arrhenius
   diagram of the H diffusion coefficient obtained by molecular dynamics in
   the single-crystal case provides too small values of activation energy
   in comparison with experimental data. However, molecular-dynamics
   simulations indicate a large increase of these values in the presence of
   defects. The influence of imperfections on the diffusion of hydrogen
   becomes less important at around 1000 K. This conclusion confirms the
   experimental results revealing a good characteristic (Q value > 10(10))

Abstract = {{A series of image analysis routines, stochastic geometry methodology,
   and a design-based stereological procedure have been developed to
   quantify objectively the length, layout, and the true density of
   neuronal dendritic spines observed at the light (or confocal) microscope
   level. First, the image of a dendritic fragment of interest (in the
   plane of view) is scaled to a standard brightness scale, and the
   dendritic profile is separated from the background using a computerized
   thresholding algorithm that analyzes the histogram of grey levels.
   Secondly, the resulting binary image of the dendrite is transformed to a
   midline skeleton that underlies the dendritic geometry. Thirdly,
   skeletal branch lengths are directly computed (in pixels), thus giving
   objective measures of visible spine lengths and inter-spine distances
   along the dendritic stem. These raw data are the basis for (1) an
   estimation of the distribution of 3D spine lengths, and (2) a nearest
   neighbour analysis of the spine layout along the dendrite. A
   design-based stereological routine, the tilting disector, is suggested
   for unbiased estimation of the true (3D) density of spines along
   dendrites. The routine involves tilting the dendritic fragment of
   interest around its longitudinal axis for a known angular sector and
   scoring the number of spines seen in one angular position and unseen in
   the other position. Data from a study of neuronal dendrites in the chick
   forebrain are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Immunization of ewes against the N-terminal peptide of inhibin alpha 43
   (alpha N) reduces fertility; this is thought to be due to impaired
   oocyte release at ovulation. This study further investigates the effect
   of alpha N immunoneutralization on the ovulatory process. Light
   microscopy was used to examine the effects of alpha N immunization on
   the tissue-remodeling process during ovulation and formation of the
   corpus luteum (CL) structure. Changes in follicular levels of matrix
   metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) with approaching ovulation were also
   investigated in normal and alpha N-immunized ewes. Differences in
   structure of 2-day-old CL were observed between control and alpha
   N-immunized ewes. Control CL had confluent luteal tissue throughout the
   internal structure and invaginations of theca and vasculature were
   common and penetrated deep into the luteal tissue. Immunized ewe CL had
   large fluid-filled antra, giving them a cystic appearance; luteal tissue
   remained a thin 10- to 15-cell layer lining the wall surrounding the
   antrum. Infolding of the surrounding tissue was incomplete, and
   thecal/vascular invaginations were rare and failed to penetrate into the
   luteal tissue. Morphologically normal rupture stigma were seen at the
   apex of both control and alpha N-immunized CL. Gelatin-digesting
   activity in follicular fluid collected 0, 12, and 24 h after hCG
   administration in control ewes increased significantly as the time of
   ovulation approached (827 +/- 182, 842 +/- 159, and 1230 +/- 89 mU/ml,
   respectively, in Exp 1; 743 +/- 32, 1182 +/- 98, and 1306 +/- 91 mU/ml
   at the same times in Exp 2). alpha N immunization reduced follicular
   gelatinase activity at each time in Exp 1 (533 +/- 132, 740 +/- 67, and
   809 +/- 147 mU/ml) and Exp 2 (587 +/- 21, 768 +/- 27, and 891 +/- 53
   mU/ml); the reduction was significant at 24 h in Exp 1 and at all times
   in Exp 2. Gelatin zymography of follicular fluid revealed bands of
   gelatinase of 72/67 kilodaltons, consistent with latent and active
   MMP-2. The area digested by both latent and active MMP-2 increased with
   approaching time of ovulation and was reduced by alpha N immunization.
   These data suggest that MMP-2 has a role in the tissue-remodeling
   processes of ovulation and CL formation in the ewe and that immunization
   against alpha N, which impairs fertility, effects the preovulatory
   cascade of intrafollicular proteolytic activity, reducing MMP-2 levels
   and disrupting normal CL formation.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to utilize glucose and the weaker sugar acidogen, galactose,
   was surveyed in salivary sediment, pooled dental plaque, and in pure
   cultures of the bacteria that numerically comprise most of the bacteria
   in these mixed microbial systems. Except for a veillonella isolate,
   which showed no uptake of either sugar, glucose was utilized more
   rapidly than galactose by the 27 pure cultures tested and by both
   sediment and plaque. This sugar difference was also seen for two other
   measures of glycolysis, formation of acid and previously studied ability
   to produce an acidic pH. Rates of uptake of the two sugars by individual
   pure cultures varied considerably. Generally, the Gram-positive bacteria
   utilized glucose and galactose at rates similar to those seen with
   salivary sediment and dental plaque, whereas the Gram-negative cultures
   tested showed much slower uptakes. Bacteria previously identified as
   arginolytic had lower glucose and galactose uptake rates than similar
   non-arginolytic micro-organisms. This, together with the ability to
   produce base from arginine, would explain their tendency to produce a
   less acidic pH. In pure culture mixtures, uptakes were generally
   predictable and indicated an averaging effect. When the microbial
   compositions of salivary sediment or dental plaque were altered by
   mixing with pure cultures of high glucolytic activity, such as many of
   the Gram-positives, glucose uptake was enhanced. The opposite was
   observed when the less glucolytic Gram-negative bacteria were similarly
   incorporated. As well as determining the glucose and galactose uptake
   rates of the various bacteria that collectively comprise the bulk of the
   salivary sediment and supragingival plaque microfloras, this study has
   shown how variation in microbial composition affects sugar uptake rates
   and has indicated how microbial composition could be manipulated to
   produce dental plaques with different capacities to ferment sugars and
   presumably different cariogenicities.}},

   have an open probability of 0.4. Noradrenaline and carbachol reduced
   I-AHP amplitude by lowering open channel probability. These results
   indicate that a novel calcium-activated potassium channel underlies
   I-AHP. This channel is modulated in a similar fashion by two different
   transmitter systems that utilize distinct protein kinases.}},

Abstract = {{Data on total dry tissue weight and shell length were obtained from an
   intertidal population of Mytilus edulis located in an estuary in SW
   England. Representation of the log(10) transformed data is significantly
   improved by the use of a segmented regression instead of a single linear
   regression. There is a significant reduction in the slope (b) of the
   regression, relating total dry tissue weight (y) to shell length (x),
   for mussels over 50.3 mm. This pertains also to the component tissues:
   mantle (at 50.1 mm shell length), digestive gland (at 60.4 mm) and
   remainder (at 52.7 mm). Weight of mantle tissue and of digestive gland
   does not change (b congruent to 0), whilst remaining tissue increases,
   but at a reduced rate, as shell length increases in excess of these
   respective sizes. Stereological examination of sections of mantle tissue
   were made throughout the year. Results indicate that high levels of
   reproductive tissue (i.e. > 80\% of mantle volume) are achieved in half
   as many large individuals (mean shell length 64.7 mm) as in 2 smaller
   size groups (means of 35.1 and 50.4 mm). These results suggest that
   reproductive effort increases to a maximum at a shell length. of
   approximately 50 mm, thereafter declining as size increases. A Segmented
   regression is also appropriate to describe the relationship of total
   tissue and mantle tissue weight to shell length of a sample from another
   estuarine population, but not from a wave exposed, open shore
   population. Reasons for these observations are discussed in the context
   of the feeding:metabolism ratio, availability of food and age.}},

Abstract = {{Restriction enzyme analysis of total genomic DNA was applied to study
   the epidemiology of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) isolated
   from the nasopharynges of children with recurrent acute otitis media
   (AOM). The turnover of strains, as judged from genetic fingerprinting of
   a total of 213 H. influenzae isolates collected prospectively during a
   2-year study period from 38 children under 3 years of age, was examined
   in relation to episodes of AOM as well as to courses of antibiotic
   treatment. The children were selected if they had had at least one
   episode of AOM before 1 year of age and if more than two nasopharyngeal
   isolates of H. influenzae were recovered. The 213 H. influenzae isolates
   (90\% NTHI) recovered corresponded to 128 different DNA fingerprints.
   Fifty-eight percent of the fingerprints were observed only once, whereas
   42\% appeared on two or more occasions in isolates from the same
   individual or in close relatives, i.e., brothers and sisters;
   Sixty-seven percent of these strains had a minimum colonization period
   of 2 months or less. Intermittent nasopharyngeal colonization periods
   longer than 5 months could be demonstrated for 13\% of the strains. The
   present data suggest that intermittent colonization is due to endogenous
   reinfections. Genetically identical NTHI strains from unrelated
   individuals were never identified. As expected from the observation of a
   relatively high proportion of persistent colonizations, no correlation
   was found bet ween episodes of AOM and the acquisition of new strains of
   N. influenzae, nor was any direct relation between antimicrobial therapy
   and the elimination of nasopharyngeal colonization, with a particular
   strain of H. influenzae observed.}},

Abstract = {{A strategy is proposed for the monitoring of powder blending. Samples
   are taken throughout the blender vessel and scanned by diffuse
   reflectance spectroscopy in the NIR range. The NIR spectra are first
   subjected to the Standard Normal Variate transformation (SNV). The first
   approach consists of overlaying the transformed spectra taken from
   different locations at each time. To quantify the differences between
   the spectra, the standard deviation spectrum at each time is calculated
   and the mean standard deviation value is plotted as a function of time.
   This plot indicates the time at which the blend is most homogeneous.
   Each individual spectrum can be compared with the `'mixture'' spectrum,
   which is an approximation of the spectrum of a true homogeneous sample.
   For that purpose several approaches, i.e. determination of the
   dissimilarity, Principal Component Analysis, are proposed. As an
   alternative approach to monitoring the blending the use of SIMPLISMA is
   recommended.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Clinical services for psychiatrically impaired populations
   have only recently been studied with scientifically valid designs to
   explore innovations in structure, accessibility, and financing. Health
   systems reform in the United States has provided the impetus for better
   defining clinically effective and cost-sensitive models for mental
   health services. This article reviews assertive community treatment,
   used for adults with severe mental illnesses, and multisystemic therapy,
   used for adolescents with serious emotional disturbances, as examples of
   service system innovations that have been studied with controlled
   clinical trial designs and have demonstrated efficacy in treating
   difficult and costly clinical populations. Method: The authors reviewed
   the Published controlled clinical trials of assertive community
   treatment and multisystemic therapy, focusing on the clinical and
   administrative elements that distinguish them from traditional service
   systems. Results: A qualitative assessment of these two approaches
   suggests that they share common elements, with important implications
   for mental health policy. Specifically, the use of an ecological model
   of behavior applied to mental health patients is critical to both
   systems. In addition, therapeutic principles emphasizing pragmatic
   (outcome-oriented) treatment approaches, home-based interventions, and
   individualized goals are key elements of their success. Most important,
   both systems embody a therapeutic philosophy demanding therapist
   accountability, in which personnel are rewarded for clinical outcomes
   and therapeutic innovation rather than for following a prescribed plan.
   Conclusions: As empirically tested approaches, assertive community
   treatment and multisystemic therapy provide a scientific foundation for
   continued reform and serve to illustrate critical elements in designing
   new community treatment initiatives for behavioral as well as medical
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Exact equations are developed for analyzing the binding of ligands to a
   linear lattice of over lapping sites in which occupied-unoccupied as
   well as occupied-occupied interactions are included for the analysis of
   the binding isotherms. We demonstrate that positive cooperativity on the
   binding of ligands to multiple sites may derive from either
   occupied-unoccupied or occupied-occupied interactions. When the binding
   of proteins to linear polynucleotides and DNA has exhibited positive
   cooperativity protein-protein (occupied-occupied), interactions have
   heretofore been invoked as the sole energetic source in determining the
   cooperative effect. Models and equations developed previously for the
   analysis of these binding isotherms have included only the
   protein-protein interactions (usually characterized with the symbol
   omega). The exact equations of this paper are capable of analyzing
   binding data in a manner to evaluate the relative importance of both
   occupied-unoccupied and occupied-occupied interactions.
   Relations derived here are employed to analyze some existing data, and
   the resulting parameter values ave compared to those developed with
   equations employing only the protein-protein (occupied-occupied)
   interactions. The resulting parameter values ave qualitatively
   different. Values of the binding constants differ by about three orders
   of magnitude. When only protein-protein interactions are taken into
   account, the resulting free energy of interaction is negative,
   indicating attractive forces between bound protein molecules; when both
   occupied-unoccupied and occupied-occupied interactions are applied, the
   resulting free energies of interaction are positive, indicating
   destabilizing forces acting primarily on the polynucleotide lattice. (C)

Abstract = {{To explore the syndrome of glucocorticoid-induced hypertension in the
   elderly, we analyzed the clinical findings from 35 patients aged more
   than 65 years (12 men, 23 women) who received glucocorticoid therapy.
   Resting blood pressures (BP) were less than 140/90 mm Hg before
   glucocorticoid therapy, and patients were apparently disease-free apart
   from the condition for which glucocorticoid therapy was prescribed.
   Glucocorticoid-induced hypertension is defined as systolic BP more than
   160 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP more than 95 mm Hg after glucocorticoid
   administration. Glucocorticoid-induced hypertension was seen in 13
   patients (37.1\%); all patients with hypertension {[}steroid
   (glucocorticoid)-induced hypertension (SH(+)) group] received more than
   20 mg of prednisolone daily, and BP rose rapidly within a week of
   commencing glucocorticoid administration. The SH(+) group did not differ
   significantly in terms of age, heart rate, blood count, plasma
   biochemistry, plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone, routine
   urinalysis, or urinary electrolytes from patients who did not show
   hypertension {[}SH(-) group]. However, serum total calcium
   concentrations were significantly lower in the SH(+) group both before
   and after 2 weeks of glucocorticoid therapy than in the SH(-) group.
   Furthermore, the SH(+) group showed a significantly higher percentage of
   patients with a positive family history of essential hypertension than
   the SH(-) group. In conclusion, although the detailed mechanisms are as
   yet uncertain, glucocorticoid-induced hypertension occurs often in
   elderly patients, and is more common in patients with total serum
   calcium concentrations lower than the normal range, and/or in those with
   positive family history of essential hypertension.}},

Abstract = {{Background radiation is likely to constitute one of the factors involved
   in biological evolution since radiations are able to affect biological
   processes. Therefore, it is possible to hypothesize that organisms are
   adapted to environmental background radiation and that this adaptation
   could increase their ability to respond to the harmful effects of
   ionizing radiations. In fact, adaptive responses to alkylating agents
   and to low doses of ionizing radiation have been found in many
   organisms. In order to test for effects of adaptation, cell
   susceptibility to treatments with high doses of radiomimetic chemical
   agents has been studied by growing them in a reduced environmental
   radiation background. The experiment has been performed by culturing
   yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae D7) in parallel in a standard
   background environment and in the underground Gran Sasso National
   Laboratory, with reduced environmental background radiation. After a
   conditioning period, yeast cells were exposed to recombinogenic doses of
   methyl methanesulfonate. The yeast cells grown in the Gran Sasso
   Laboratory showed a higher frequency of radiomimetic induced
   recombination as compared to those grown in the standard environment.
   This suggests that environmental radiation may act as a conditioning
   agent.}},

   antagonized the fungistatic activity of AmB at sub-MICs if both
   substances acted simultaneously, This coincubation test was primarily
   developed to observe the azole-mediated demethylase inhibition
   quantitatively by bioassay. Interestingly, the occurrence of azole-AmB
   antagonism depended on azole lipophilia if specially selected test
   conditions were applied. By a consecutive incubation regimen,
   preincubation at high azole concentrations (1 to 50 mu g/ml) and then
   subsequent incubation with AmB (1 mu g/ml), only preincubation with the
   three lipophilic azoles decreased the fungicidal activity of AmB but not
   that of FCZ. It was shown that yeasts absorb only lipophilic azoles to a
   remarkable extent. This fact might be responsible for the absence of
   antagonism of FCZ to AmB when yeasts were incubated consecutively. It
   can be concluded with caution that consecutive treatment of candidiasis
   with FCZ and AmB does not necessarily result in a clinically relevant
   antagonism.}},

Volume = {{105}},

Abstract = {{In eight subjects standing on a movable platform, surface EMG activity
   was recorded from the foot muscles extensor digitorum brevis (EDB) and
   flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) and from the leg muscles soleus (Sol) and
   tibialis anterior (TA) during perturbations of upright stance.
   Perturbations inducing foot dorsiflexion (upward tilt and backward
   translation) evoked a short-latency response (SLR) and a medium-latency
   response (MLR) to stretch in the physiological extensors FDB and Sol,
   and a long-latency response (LLR) in the physiological flexors EDB and
   TA. Perturbations inducing plantar-flexion (downward tilt and forward
   translation) evoked the MLR in EDB and TA, and the LLR in FDB and Sol.
   The latency of the FDB and Sol SLR was compared to that of the H and T
   reflexes evoked in the same muscles by electrical or mechanical
   stimulation, respectively. In both muscles, the T reflex and the SLR
   followed the H reflex at delays accounted for by the different
   stimulation mode, indicating that the SLR induced in both muscles by
   upward tilt and backward translation was a true autogenetic stretch
   reflex from spindle primaries. The time interval between the onset of
   SLR and of MLR was significantly greater for the FDB than the Sol
   muscle, suggesting that MLR is a spinal reflex travelling through slower
   peripheral afferent pathways than SLR. From these latency differences
   and from the distance between the muscles, we calculated in four
   subjects the conduction velocity of the afferent fibres presumably
   responsible for the MLR in FDB. This was about 29 m/s. LLRs were evoked
   in TA and EDB during upward tilt and backward translation, and in Sol
   and FDB during downward tilt, but not forward translation. LLRs did not
   adhere to a proximal-to-distal pattern, since these could appear earlier
   in the foot than in the leg muscles. All responses were modulated by
   perturbation type (tilt vs translation) and body posture (normal stance
   vs forward leaning). Both the large amplitude of the foot muscle
   responses and their temporal pattern indicate that the muscles acting on
   the toes play a major role in stabilising posture. Their action
   increases in amplitude and extends in time the foot-ground reaction
   force, thereby improving the efficiency of the superimposed action of
   the leg muscle responses.-}},

   Design: Prospective.
   Setting: Division of urologic microsurgery and associated hospital-based

   Main Outcome Measures: Fertilization and pregnancy rates.
   Patients: Men referred to our fertility unit for treatment of bilateral
   congenital absence of the vas deferens, using sperm surgically retrieved
   from the epididymis with IVF and micromanipulation.
   Results: Of 45 men with bilateral congenital absence of the vas, 54\%
   (19/35) tested were found to be carriers of CFTR gene mutations, with
   one compound heterozygote. Epididymal sperm from men affected with CFTR
   mutations fertilized 19\% (29/152) of oocytes, whereas men without;
   mutations fertilized 22\% (44/204) of oocytes. Pregnancy rates (PRs)

Abstract = {{1. Neural activity was recorded from the orbitofrontal cortex (OF) of
   rats performing an eight-odor discrimination task that included
   predictable associations between particular odor pairs. A modified
   linear discriminant analysis was employed to characterize the population
   response in each trial of the task as a point in an N-dimensional
   activity space with the firing rate of each cell in the population
   represented on one of the N dimensions. The ability of the ensemble to
   discriminate among conditions of a variable was reflected in the
   tendency of population responses to cluster together in this activity
   space for repetitions of a given condition. We assessed coding of
   several variables describing the period of odor sampling, focusing on
   aspects of current, past, and future events reflected in single-neuron
   firing patterns, in ensembles composed of 22-138 cells active during the
   period when the rats sampled the discriminative stimulus in each trial.
   2. OF ensembles performed well at discriminating variables with
   relevance to task demands represented in single-neuron firing patterns,
   specifically the physical attributes and assigned reward contingency of
   the current odor as well as the expectation of reward in the following
   trial that could be inferred from the predictable associations between
   particular pairs of odors. OF ensembles were able to correctly identify
   the identity and assigned reward contingency of the current odor in up
   to 52\% (chance = 12.5\%) and 99\% (chance = 50\%) of all trials,
   respectively, such that the observed behavioral performance required a
   population of 5,364 odor-responsive cells in the case of odor identity
   and only 40 cells in the case of valence. Expectations regarding
   upcoming rewards based on both assigned response contingency and
   associations between particular pairs of odors were correctly classified
   in up to 67\% (chance = 20\%) of all trials such that the observed level
   of behavioral performance required a population of 3,169 cells.
   3. Other information represented in the single-neuron firing patterns,
   such as the identity and reward contingency of the preceding odor and
   specific odor-odor associations, was poorly encoded by OF ensembles.
   Thus neural ensembles in OF may represent only some of the information
   reflected in single-neuron activity. Stable coding of only the most
   useful and relevant information by the ensemble might emerge from the
   tuning properties of single neurons under the influence of the task at
   hand, producing in the well-trained animal the observed pattern of broad
   and diverse coding by single neurons and selective, task-relevant coding
   by neural ensembles in OF.}},

Abstract = {{Calcium responses of isolated rat pineal cells to noradrenergic,
   cholinergic and vasopressinergic stimulations were recorded by use of
   the fura-2 technique and an image analysis system. Subsequently the
   recorded cells were identified as pinealocytes by immunocytochemical
   demonstration of S-antigen, a pinealocyte-specific marker. S-antigen
   immunoreactive pinealocytes were shown to respond to norepinephrine
   stimulation with an elevation of the intracellular free calcium
   concentration ({[}Ca2+](i)). This response was dose-dependent and
   consisted of a rapid increase in {[}Ca2+](i) (primary phase) followed by
   a decrease to an elevated plateau well above the basal level (secondary
   phase). The plateau persisted for at least 1 h when cells were
   constantly exposed to norepinephrine and dropped to basal level upon
   removal of the stimulus. Analysis of the calcium responses of cells
   treated with caffeine or thapsigargin suggested that the primary phase
   reflects mobilization of calcium from inositol
   1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive intracellular calcium stores. Depletion of
   these calcium stores was a decisive and sufficient prerequisite to evoke
   the secondary phase which was apparently elicited by calcium influx.
   These data suggest that a capacitative calcium entry is involved in
   pineal calcium signalling. Acetylcholine induced an increase in
   {[}Ca2+](i) in rat pinealocytes. Experiments with different cholinergic
   agonists and antagonists provided evidence that the
   acelylcholine-induced calcium response was mediated via nicotinic
   acetylcholine receptors. Stimulation of isolated rat pineal cells with
   arginine-vasopressin caused a rise in {[}Ca2+](i) in approx. 5\% of the
   cells. However, these cells remained unidentified because they contained
   neither immunoreactive S-antigen nor immunoreactive glial fibrillary
   acidic protein, a marker for interstitial (glial) cells of the rat
   pineal organ. Taken together, the results underline the pivotal role of
   norepinephrine for the regulation of pineal signal transduction, but
   they also support the notion that other neurotransmitters and
   neuropeptides are involved in the modulation of pineal calcium
   signalling.}},

Abstract = {{Identification of European Armillaria species using ribosomal DNA (rDNA)
   restriction-fragment-length-polymorphisms morphisms (RFLPs) was studied.
   A total of 44 Armillaria isolates representing five European biological
   species were examined. Whole-cell DNAs were digested with one or two
   (double digest) restriction endonucleases and probed with a cloned
   plasmid carrying one complete rDNA repeat copy of Saccharomyces
   carlsbergensis. Applying the restriction endonuclease BglII in
   combination with either EcoRI, BamH1 or HindIII, it was possible to
   detect rDNA RFLPs allowing differentiation between all five European
   Armillaria species investigated in the study. The most conclusive
   results were obtained in the rDNA/AvaII RFLP pattern. All biological
   species showed unique AvaII banding patterns. Generally speaking, the
   interspecific similarities were around 42\% and lower, indicating a
   distinct species separation.
   The analysis of rDNA RFLP patterns by a restriction-enzyme-rDNA-probe
   combination (for instance, AvaII or BglII/HindIII; probe pMY 60) is a
   practical means of identifying European Armillaria species for further
   taxonomic, phylogenetic and host-pathogen interaction studies.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the abundance and bacterial colonization pattern of
   transparent exopolymeric particles (TEP) during 2 different ecological
   conditions along a trophic gradient in the northern Adriatic Sea.
   Generally, neither TEP density (ranging from 0 to 600 TEP ml(-1)) nor
   mean TEP area were found to be correlated with chlorophyll a
   concentrations, although a tendency was discernible of increasing TEP
   density and area towards more eutrophic conditions. TEP area ranged from
   12 to 7500 mu m(2) with TEP-attached bacteria inversely correlated with
   TEP aera. In laboratory experiments using water amended with dissolved
   organic matter released by a Chaetoceros sp. batch culture, we examined
   the influence of bacteria and turbulence on the formation of TEP. In
   both biotic and abiotic treatments subjected to turbulence, TEP density
   and area reached maximum levels within 24 h and retained this level over
   a period of similar to 40 h. In the stagnant treatment, however, TEP
   area declined rapidly after reaching a peak similar to 24 h after
   starting the experiment. Based on our experments, we conclude that
   turbulence of the water column is more important than bacteria in the
   formation of TEP. In situ fluctuations in TEP abundance might reflect
   not only differences in phytoplankton growth stage but also different
   turbulent regimes.}},

Abstract = {{The mRNA for cysteine-rich secretory protein-3 (CRISP-3) was originally
   identified in the mouse salivary gland as an androgen-dependent
   transcript, and is closely related to CRISP-1 and CRISP-2 which are
   abundantly expressed in the epididymis and testis respectively.
   Overlapping phage clones encompassing the entire length of the CRISP-3
   gene were isolated from a lambda EMBL3 genomic library and analysed. DNA
   sequencing revealed that the gene consisted of eight exons ranging
   between 55 and 740 bp in size, and seven introns. All exon-intron
   junctions conformed to the GT/AG rule established for eukaryotic genes.
   The length of the introns was determined by PCR and was found to vary
   between 1.0 and 3.7 kb, indicating that the gene spans over 20 kb of the
   mouse genome. Primer extension allowed the mapping of the major
   transcription initiation site to an adenine located at the appropriate
   position downstream of a bona fide TATA box, in a region corresponding
   well to the eukaryotic consensus sequence. Over 800 bp of CRISP-3
   promoter region were determined and two regions almost exactly matching
   the androgen-responsive element consensus RGWACANNNTGTWCY detected. In
   addition, sequences described in the Drosophila melanogaster Sgs-3 gene
   as being involved in its salivary gland-specific expression as well as
   two putative OTF- and GATA-binding elements were also found.}},

   to assess the role of the protease in anaphylaxis and in particular to
   ascertain whether it is responsible for the histological changes, which
   include widespread epithelial shedding, seen ire the mucosa in in vivo
   models of anaphylaxis. Perfusion of the jejunal vasculature with a

   jejunal mast cells in all rats studied. The baseline concentration of
   RMCP-II was significantly greater (p<0.05) in immune rats (>7 ng/ml)
   exposed to nippostrongylus infection than in control, naive animals (<2
   ng/ml). Challenge of immune rats with 100 or 400 worm equivalents of
   whole worm antigen resulted in an immediate (within 40 seconds) and
   significant (p<0.02) increase in the concentration of RMCP-II (to >3 mu
   g/ml) in the vascular perfusate, which was not seen in naive rats or
   immune rats challenged with an irrelevant antigen. Greater amounts of
   RMCP-II were also recovered from the jejunal lumen of immune rats
   compared with naive rats after challenge of both groups with worm
   antigen. Despite the release of microgram quantities of RMCP-II into the

Abstract = {{Integrins are a class of adhesion molecules that depends on divalent
   cations for proper function. This study examined whether human normal
   melanocytes and malignant (metastatic) melanocytes with early and late
   stages of cellular differentiation (G361 and SK-MEL-23, respectively)
   would differ in integrin-mediated adhesion to fibronectin, laminin, as
   well as collagens type I and type IV, and whether divalent cations could
   influence the strength of adhesion ability. Integrin subunit expression
   was determined by how cytometry using integrin subunit-specific
   antibodies as probes. Integrin-specific adhesion was determined using
   soluble glycine-arginine-glycine-asparagine-serine peptide and integrin
   subunit-specific antibodies as functional blocking agents. This study
   shows that both normal and malignant melanocytes adhere to extracellular
   matrices in a divalent cation-dependent manner, and adhesion strength
   varies with the cation species. Integrins can be rapidly activated by
   small alterations in cation concentration, manganese being the most
   potent. There were marked differences in substrate adhesion between
   normal melanocytes and metastatic malignant melanoma cells, but these
   differences were not related to the stage of cellular differentiation.
   All the three cell types, however, expressed the same integrin subunits
   at approximately the same levels, This suggests that substrate adhesion
   of melanocytes and melanoma cells might involve some
   integrin-independent mechanisms as well. Manganese, in particular,
   appears to cause adhesion by activating both integrin-dependent and
   -independent mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Filings from a printed circuit board were extracted and analysed for
   unreacted tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA). About 0.7 mu g free TBBPA per
   gram circuit board were found, corresponding to about 4 mu g free TBBPA
   per gram of TBBPA used in the circuit board. These values are probably
   underestimates of the true levels due to incomplete extraction.
   Surficial sediments taken upstream and downstream from a plastics
   industry where TBBPA is used were analysed for both TBBPA and its
   dimethylated derivative, MeTA. The TBBPA concentration was 34 ng/g dry
   weight upstream of the industry and 270 ng/g dry weight downstream. The
   corresponding concentrations of MeTA were 24 and 1500 ng/g dry weight
   respectively.
   TBBPA was also found in two sewage sludge samples analysed. One sample
   was collected from the sewage treatment plant that receives leach water
   from a landfill with wastes from the investigated plastics industry. The
   other sample was collected from a sewage treatment plant where no known
   users of TBBPA are connected. The levels of TBBPA in these samples were
   similar to those found in the samples upstream from the industry.
   During the analysis of a number of biological samples for lipophilic
   brominated substances, MeTA has been screened, but so far no MeTA has
   been detected.}},

Abstract = {{One key telecommunications issue being discussed in both state and
   national forums is the effect of regulatory programs on the development
   of telecommunications infrastructure and any potential beneficial
   impacts on the national economy.  Some have advised government agencies
   to develop and implement `'industrial policy'' initiatives to achieve
   specific investment objectives.
   These issues are examined by analyzing the assumption that increases in
   telecommunications infrastructure should be implicitly funded by
   `'taxing'' current telecommunications ratepayers with deliberately
   overstated government-regulated telephone rates.  The paper emphasizes
   the economics literature concerning private provision of quasi-public
   goods and quantitative macroeconomic effects of taxing consumers.}},
