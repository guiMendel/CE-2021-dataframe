Abstract = {{Olivine LiFePO4/C composite anode materials were synthesized by a solid

   measurement and electrochemical performance testing. The results
   demonstrate that pure and well-crystallized powders, smaller particle
   size and intimate carbon contact are necessary for optimizing
   electrochemical performance. The material calcined at 750 degrees C had
   a complete olivine structure, uniform surface morphology, better
   particle-size distribution and excellent electrochemical performances.
   The initial discharge capacity, namely 142. 5 mA center dot h/g, was

Abstract = {{ADAM-9 belongs to a family of transmembrane disintegrin-containing
   metalloproteinases (ADAMs) involved in protein ectodomain shedding and
   cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. However, the specific biological
   functions of ADAM-9 are still unclear. The aim of this study was to
   analyze the expression of ADAM-9 in melanoma in vivo and in melanoma
   cell lines in vitro. In melanoma ADAM-9 protein expression appeared to
   be restricted to the melanoma cells within the invading front.
   Interestingly, ADAM-9 protein was detected in the melanoma cells and in
   peritumoral stromal fibroblasts, while it was absent in fibroblasts
   distal to the tumor site. RNA analysis of melanoma cell lines with
   different invasive abilities showed ADAM-9 expression in varying amounts
   in all cell lines, independent of their invasive and metastatic
   capacities. In MV3 melanoma cells, ADAM-9 expression did not depend on
   homotypic cell-cell contact and on cell-matrix interaction when the
   cells were cultured on planar extracellular matrix components. However,
   we observed downregulation of ADAM-9 mRNA expression upon culture of
   melanoma cells within 3-dimensional lattices composed of fibrillar type
   I collagen, whereas culture within gels consisting of the polysaccharide
   alginate did not alter transcript levels. These results identified
   fibrillar collagen type I as a key factor in ADAM-9 regulation by
   cell-matrix interactions. Interestingly, we also observed a 3-fold
   downregulation of ADAM-9 transcript levels upon treatment with
   interleukin (IL)-1 alpha, a proinflammatory cytokine known to induce
   expression of other ADAM and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family
   members. In summary, our data suggest a novel role of fibrillar collagen
   and of soluble factors for the regulation of ADAM-9 expression in vitro.

Abstract = {{We present a unified model for complete crystal-growth inhibition based
   on the thermodynamics of interfaces. The premise for our model is that
   the adsorption of inhibitor leads to a reduction in interfacial tension
   or edge energy for the crystal surface or step, respectively. In our
   formulation, the work to add a layer or grow a step increases due to the
   difference in interfacial tensions or edge energies for surfaces with
   and without an adsorbed inhibitor. For a large enough difference in
   interfacial tensions or edge energies, complete inhibition of growth is
   realized when the total work does not decrease as more crystals are
   formed. We demonstrate that our model can provide a theoretical
   description of critical subcooling data for ice with antifreeze proteins
   and glycoproteins, critical subcooling data for hydrates and ionic
   crystals, and critical supersaturation data for various crystal systems.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{123}},

Abstract = {{We report measurements of the formation and desorption of ionic
   fragments induced by very low-energy (10-200 eV) Ar+ irradiation of
   thymine (T) films, deposited on a polycrystalline Pt substrate. A
   multitude of dissociation channels is observed, among which the major
   cation species are identified as HNCH+, HNC3H4+, C3H3+, OCNH2+,
   {[}T-OCN](+), {[}T-OCNH2](+), {[}T-O](+), and {[}T+H](+) and the major
   anions as H-, O-, CN-,and OCN-. Cation fragment desorption appears at
   much lower threshold energies (near 15 eV) than anion fragment
   desorption, where the latter depends strongly on the film thickness. It
   is proposed that anion fragment formation and desorption results from
   projectile impact-induced excitation of either (1) a neutral thymine
   molecule, followed by fragmentation and charge exchange between the
   energetic neutral fragment and the substrate (or film) and/or (2) a
   deprotonated monoanionic thymine molecule to a dissociative state,
   followed by a unimolecular fragmentation of the excited thymine anion.
   The H- and O- fragment formations may have a further contribution from
   dipolar dissociation, e.g., formation of electronically excited neutral
   thymine, followed by dissociation into O-+{[}T-O](+), due to their
   reduced sensitivity to the film thickness. Positive-ion fragment
   desorption exhibits no significant dependence on film thickness before
   the emergence of surface charging, and originates from a kinetically
   assisted charge-transfer excitation. The results suggest that the
   potential energy of the incident ion plays a significant role in
   lowering the threshold energy of kinetic fragmentation of thymine.
   Measurements of the time-dependent film degradation yields for 100-eV
   Ar+ suggest a quantum efficiency for degradation of about six thymine
   molecules per incident ion. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics.}},

   Ionization Detector- based micrometeorological measurement system and
   tested it at a large municipal landfill in Finland. The technical
   characteristics of the system allowed use of the eddy covariance method,
   enabling emission monitoring at a much lower cost than employing a
   Tunable Diode Laser instrument, which we used as a reference. Combining
   methane and carbon dioxide flux measurements we were able to estimate
   the methane generation rate, gas collection efficiency and oxidation
   rate in the landfill surface layer. We showed that the oxidation
   fraction may differ significantly from the default value used in the
   IPCC emission modelling, and that high emission rates were observed in
   the active deposition areas of the landfill.}},

   levels were quantitatively measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   (ELISA) using the monoclonal antibody 8E11. Increase in 8-OHdG levels
   was observed in subjects from 31 to 60 yr of age. Higher levels of
   8-OHdG were observed in the stomach tissues of those in the 51-60 yr old
   group. Although Helicobacter. Pylori-positive group subjects had higher
   8-OHdG levels than those in the H. pylori-negative group, no age-related
   changes in 8-OHdG levels were observed in these groups. The levels of
   BPDE-l-DNA adduct also markedly increased with age. Higher levels of
   BPDE-1-DNA adduct were observed in subjects aged 61-70 yr, but this
   difference was not significant from other age groups. These results
   provide evidence that there is a progressive age-dependent accumulation
   of oxidative DNA damage and of BPDE-1-DNA adducts in human stomach
   tissues. It is possible that such damage contributes to the known
   increased incidence of gastric tumor with aging.}},

Abstract = {{{[}1] The fully kinetic theory of low-frequency electromagnetic modes in
   high-beta plasma is developed accounting for finite ion-Larmor radius
   effects (FLR) in non-Maxwellian space plasmas. The most general linear
   mirror mode dispersion relation is derived for arbitrary velocity
   distributions in the fully kinetic limit. Closer inspection shows that
   this dispersion relation describes two different instabilities. The
   first one corresponds to the classical mirror instability on the slow
   mode branch including FLR effects. Its growth rate attains a maximum at
   wavelengths the order of the ion gyroradius. Furthermore, if the plasma
   is mirror stable, i.e., when the condition for the mirror instability is
   not satisfied, another instability arises in the presence of a halo on
   the tail of the ion distribution. We term this new instability ``halo
   instability.'' It grows complementary to the mirror instability on the
   fast mode branch. It arises under conditions when the ratio of halo and
   thermal velocities exceeds some well-defined critical value.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of school absenteeism data for early outbreak detection, New
   York City}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: School absenteeism data may have utility as an early
   indicator of disease outbreaks, however their value should be critically
   examined. This paper describes an evaluation of the utility of school
   absenteeism data for early outbreak detection in New York City (NYC).
   Methods: To assess citywide temporal trends in absenteeism, we
   downloaded three years ( 2001 02, 2002 - 03, 2003 - 04) of daily school
   attendance data from the NYC Department of Education ( DOE) website. We
   applied the CuSum method to identify aberrations in the adjusted daily
   percent absent. A spatial scan statistic was used to assess geographic
   clustering in absenteeism for the 2001 - 02 academic year.
   Results: Moderate increases in absenteeism were observed among children
   during peak influenza season. Spatial analysis detected 790 significant
   clusters of absenteeism among elementary school children ( p < 0.01),
   two of which occurred during a previously reported outbreak.
   Conclusion: Monitoring school absenteeism may be moderately useful for
   detecting large citywide epidemics, however, school-level data were
   noisy and we were unable to demonstrate any practical value in using
   cluster analysis to detect localized outbreaks. Based on these results,
   we will not implement prospective monitoring of school absenteeism data,
   but are evaluating the utility of more specific school-based data for
   outbreak detection.}},

Abstract = {{Proteins of the 6-kDa early secreted antigenic target (ESAT-6) secretion
   system-1 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are not only strongly involved in
   the anti-mycobacterial Th1-host immune response but are also key players
   for virulence. In this study, protein engineering together with
   bioinformatic, immunological, and virulence analyses allowed us to
   pinpoint regions of the ESAT-6 molecule that are critical for its
   biological activity in M. tuberculosis. Mutation of the Trp-Xaa-Gly
   motif, conserved in a wide variety of ESAT-6-like proteins, abolished
   complex formation with the partner protein CFP-10, induction of specific
   T-cell responses, and virulence. Replacement of conserved Leu residues
   interfered with secretion, coiled-coil formation, and virulence, whereas
   certain mutations at the extreme C terminus did not affect secretion but
   caused attenuation, possibly because of altered ESAT-6 targeting or
   trafficking. In contrast, the mutation of several residues on the outer
   surface of the four-helical bundle structure of the ESAT-6 center dot
   CFP-10 complex showed much less effect. Construction of recombinant BCG
   expressing ESAT-6 with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag allowed us to
   co-purify ESAT-6 and CFP-10, experimentally confirming their strong
   interaction both in and outside of the mycobacterial cell. The strain
   induced potent, antigen-specific T-cell responses and intermediate in
   vivo growth in mice, suggesting that it remained immunogenic and
   biologically active despite the tag. Together with previous NMR data,
   the results of this study have allowed a biologically relevant model of
   the ESAT-6 center dot CFP-10 complex to be constructed that is critical
   for understanding the structure-function relationship in tuberculosis
   pathogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{ATP phosphoribosyl transferase (ATP-PRT) joins ATP and
   5-phosphoribosyl-1- pyrophosphate ( PRPP) in a highly regulated reaction
   that initiates histidine biosynthesis. The unusual hetero-octameric
   version of ATP-PRT includes four HisG(S) catalytic subunits based on the
   periplasmic binding protein fold and four HisZ regulatory subunits that
   resemble histidyl-tRNA synthetases. Here, we present the first structure
   of a PRPP-bound ATP-PRT at 2.9 angstrom and provide a structural model
   for allosteric activation based on comparisons with other inhibited and
   activated ATP-PRTs from both the hetero-octameric and hexameric
   families. The activated state of the octameric enzyme is characterized
   by an interstitial phosphate ion in the HisZ-HisG interface and new
   contacts between the HisZ motif 2 loop and the HisGS dimer interface.
   These contacts restructure the interface to recruit conserved residues
   to the active site, where they activate pyrophosphate to promote
   catalysis. Additionally, mutational analysis identifies the histidine
   binding sites within a region highly conserved between HisZ and the
   functional HisRS. Through the oligomerization and functional
   re-assignment of protein domains associated with aminoacylation and
   phosphate binding, the HisZ-HisG octameric ATP-PRT acquired the ability
   to initiate the synthesis of a key metabolic intermediate in an
   allosterically regulated fashion.}},

   velocity (v(theta)) across internal transport barriers (ITB) on JET are

   along with the v(theta) radial profiles, providing a very clear link
   between the location of the steepest region of the ion temperature

Abstract = {{During 3' end processing, histone pre-mRNAs are cleaved 5 nucleotides
   after a conserved stem loop by an endonuclease dependent on the U7 small
   nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP). The upstream cleavage product
   corresponds to the mature histone mRNA, while the downstream product is
   degraded by a 5'-3' exonuclease, also dependent on the U7 snRNP. To
   identify the two nuclease activities, we carried out UV-crosslinking
   studies using both the complete RNA substrate and the downstream
   cleavage product, each containing a single radioactive phosphate and a
   phosphorothioate modification at the cleavage site. We detected a
   protein migrating at 85 kDa that crosslinked to each substrate in a
   1.17-dependent manner. Immunoprecipitation experiments identified this
   protein as CPSF-73, a known component of the cleavage/polyadenylation
   machinery. These studies suggest that CPSF-73 is both the endonuclease
   and 5'-3' exonuclease in histone-pre-mRNA processing and reveal an
   evolutionary link between 3' end formation of histone mRNAs and
   polyadenylated mRNAs.}},

   critical for controlling and optimizing the thermal spray process. A
   droplet impingement model is developed to simulate the transient flow
   dynamics during impact, spreading and solidification. The volume of
   fluid surface tracking technique is employed within a fixed Eulerian
   structured mesh. The numerical model is validated with experimental data
   from tin droplet measurements. The results prove that thermal contact
   resistance is the key element in characterizing the substrate surface
   roughness for impingement modelling. It is found that spreading,
   solidification and air entrapment are closely related to surface
   roughness.}},

Abstract = {{RNA polymerase II plays a critical role not only in transcription of
   mRNA precursors but also in their subsequent processing. This later
   function is mediated primarily by the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the
   enzyme's largest subunit, a unique, repetitive structure conserved
   throughout eukaryotes and known to interact with a number of different
   proteins during the transcription cycle. Here, we show that the
   mammalian CTD also interacts with RNA in a sequence-specific manner. We
   use a variety of RNA binding assays, including SELEX, to characterize
   the interaction in vitro and a modified chromatin immunoprecipitation
   (ChIP) assay to provide evidence that it also occurs in vivo.
   Transfection assays with the CTD binding consensus situated downstream
   of a polyadenylation signal indicate that the sequence can suppress mRNA
   3' end formation and transcription termination, and in vitro assays
   indicate that the inhibition of processing is CTD dependent. Our results
   provide an unexpected function for CTD in modulating gene expression.}},

   extreme case (delta = 0) exhibits logarithmic divergence or constant

Abstract = {{AIM: To investigate the effects of isolation stress on mouse with liver
   cancer and possible associated mechanisms.
   METHODS: Transplantable murine hepatoma22 (H22) model was used to
   evaluate the effects of social isolation stress on murine liver cancer.
   Mice were immunized with sheep red blood cell (SRBC) and
   intraperitoneally inoculated with H22 cell, then divided into two
   groups, one reared individually as group (I) and the other reared in
   groups as group (G). Titer of antibody to SRBC and interleukin 2 (IL-2)
   in serum was monitored. The survival time of mouse with liver cancer was
   observed.
   RESULTS: The titer of antibody to SRBC in group (G) was 1:24.5 and that
   in group (I) was 1:11.2. There was a significant difference between
   these two groups (t = 2.60, P = 0.02). A significant difference in IL-2
   concentration was observed between group (G) (39.6 ng/L) and group (I)
   (47.1 ng/L, t = 2.14, P = 0.046). The survival time in group (G) (16.5
   d) was markedly longer than that in group (I) (13.2 d, t = 3.46, P =
   0.002).
   CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that survival time of the mouse bearing
   H22 tumor is affected by the social isolation stress and the associated
   mechanism may be the immunological changes under the social isolation
   stress. (C) 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although protein kinase C (PKC) has been widely implicated in the
   positive and negative control of proliferation, the underlying cell
   cycle mechanisms regulated by individual PKC isozymes are only partially
   understood. In this report, we show that PKC delta mediates phorbol
   ester-induced G(1) arrest in lung adenocarcinoma cells and establish an
   essential role for this novel PKC in controlling the expression of the
   cell cycle inhibitor p21. Activation of PKC with phorbol 12-myristate
   13-acetate (PMA) in early G(1) phase impaired progression of lung
   adenocarcinoma cells into S phase, an effect that was completely
   abolished by specific depletion of PKC delta, but not PKC alpha.
   Although the PKC effect was unrelated to the inhibition of cyclin D1
   expression, PKC activation significantly up-regulated p21 and
   down-regulated Rb hyperphosphorylation and cyclin A expression.
   Elevations in p21 mRNA and protein by PMA were mediated by PKC delta but
   not PKC alpha. Studies using luciferase reporters also revealed an
   essential role for PKC delta in the PMA-induced inhibition of
   Rb-dependent cyclin A promoter activity. Finally, we showed that the
   cell cycle inhibitory effect of PKC delta is greatly attenuated by RNA
   interference-mediated knock-down of p21. Our results identify a novel
   link between PKC delta and G(1) arrest via p21 up-regulation and
   highlight the complexities in the downstream effectors of PKC isozymes
   in the context of cell cycle progression and proliferation.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of styrene content on non-exponential and non-Arrhenius
   behavior of the alpha-relaxation of cured unsaturated polyester resins
   (UPR) was investigated by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). To compare
   the temperature dependence of the relaxation times, the Angell fragility
   concept was applied to samples with different crosslink densities.
   Furthermore, the number of structural units per cooperatively
   rearranging region (CRR) was estimated using random walk model and the
   modified Adam-Gibbs theory. The results showed that rising styrene
   content enhanced the crosslink density of the networks, which altered
   the intensity and broadness of the alpha-relaxation. The fragility
   index, a measure of temperature dependence of relaxation time, and the
   average size of CRR at glass transition region was also increased by
   styrene content. Therefore, the segmental relaxation in networks with
   higher crosslink density could be associated with stronger
   intermolecular coupling. In addition, it was observed that the mean
   required energy for internal rearrangement of structural units within
   the CRR decreased as the fragility index increased, while the mean
   barrier height for repositioning of a CRR in cooperation to its local
   environment was nearly constant. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Viral infections and local production of cytokines probably contribute
   to the pathogenesis of Type 1 diabetes. The viral replicative
   intermediate double-stranded RNA ( dsRNA, tested in the form of
   polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, PIC), in combination with the cytokine
   interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), triggers beta-cell apoptosis. We have
   previously observed by microarray analysis that PIC induces expression
   of several mRNAs encoding for genes downstream of Toll-like receptor 3
   (TLR3) signaling pathway. In this report, we show that exposure of
   beta-cells to dsRNA in combination with IFN-alpha, -beta, or -gamma
   significantly increases apoptosis. Moreover, dsRNA induces TLR3 mRNA
   expression and activates NF-kappa B and the IFN-beta promoter in a
   TRIF-dependent manner. dsRNA also induces an early ( 1 h) and sustained
   increase in IFN-beta mRNA expression, and blocking IFN-beta with a
   specific antibody partially prevents PIC plus IFN-gamma-induced
   beta-cell death. On the other hand, dsRNA plus IFN-gamma does not induce
   apoptosis in INS-1E cells, and expression of TLR3 and type I IFNs mRNAs
   is not detected in these cells. Of note, disruption of the STAT-1
   signaling pathway protects beta-cells against dsRNA plus
   IFN-gamma-induced beta-cell apoptosis. This study suggests that dsRNA
   plus IFN-gamma triggers beta-cell apoptosis by two complementary
   pathways, namely TLR3-TRIF-NF-kappa B and STAT-1.}},

Abstract = {{Tachykinins are known to be major excitatory neuromodulators; in neural
   systems, including the retina of many vertebrate species. Among them
   substance P has been detected in several species, including anurans.
   However, none of the other major tachykinins has been sought for in the
   anuran retina. The aim of this study was to identify another major
   tachykinin, substance K (neurokinin A) in the frog retina and compare
   its distribution to that of substance P. Since one of the synthetic
   pathways of the above mentioned tachykinins make it possible to produce
   both peptides from one large precursor RNA, we also investigated
   possible colocalization with double-label immunocytochemistry. Our
   results show that both substance P and substance K are localized to
   wide-field amacrine cells in the retina of a terrestrial frog (Pelobates
   fuscus). Preabsorption and double-label studies provided evidence that
   the populations of substance P- and substance K-immunoreactive cells are
   clearly distinct and their dendritic arbor do not overlap in the inner
   plexiform layer of the retina. These findings provide evidence for the
   presence of (i) a novel anatomically/neurochemically identifyable
   amacrine cell type and (ii) predict distinct synthetic pathways for
   substance P and substance K in the anuran retina. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{An analysis of the first resonance mode of piezoelectric fibres with
   metal core is carried out, and a method to estimate their piezoelectric
   properties is proposed. The modelled structure is first a hollow ceramic
   cylinder. The importance of radial stresses is investigated. Correlation
   with finite element modelling (FEM) is presented to validate the
   analytical approach. The effect of the insertion of a metal core is then
   presented through the calculation of the electromechanical coupling
   factor of the whole fibre after homogenization of the metal core and the
   hollow cylinder. It is found that there is an optimal diameter at which
   the pseudo-lateral (length vibration) coupling factor is maximum.
   Finally the model is simplified, and a characterization procedure-called
   upward approach-of actual fibres is given. FEM is used to predict the
   resonance frequencies of a fibre with a platinum core. The upward
   approach is then applied, and the obtained piezoelectric ceramic
   parameters are found to be quite close to the real parameters, i.e.
   errors less than 7.9\% in the worst case.}},

Abstract = {{Hsp70 and Hsp90 protein chaperones cooperate in a protein-folding
   pathway required by many ``client{''} proteins. The co-chaperone Sti1p
   coordinates functions of Hsp70 and Hsp90 in this pathway. Sti1p has
   three tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains. TPR1 binds Hsp70, TPR2a
   binds Hsp90, and the ligand for TPR2b is unknown. Although Sti1p is
   thought to be dedicated to the client folding pathway, we earlier showed
   that Sti1p regulated Hsp70, independently of Hsp90, in a way that
   impairs yeast {[}PSI+] prion propagation. Using this prion system to
   monitor Sti1p regulation of Hsp70 and an Hsp90-inhibiting compound to
   monitor Hsp90 regulation, we identified Sti1p mutations that separately
   affect Hsp70 and Hsp90. TPR1 mutations impaired Sti1p regulation of
   Hsp70, but deletion of TPR2a and TPR2b did not. Conversely, TPR2a and
   TPR2b mutations impaired Sti1p regulation of Hsp90, but deletion of TPR1
   did not. All Sti1p mutations variously impaired the client folding
   pathway, which requires both Hsp70 and Hsp90. Thus, Sti1p regulated
   Hsp70 and Hsp90 separately, Hsp90 is implicated as a TPR2b ligand, and
   mutations separately affecting regulation of either chaperone impair a
   pathway that is dependent upon both. We further demonstrate that client
   folding depended upon bridging of Hsp70 and Hsp90 by Sti1p and find
   conservation of the independent regulation of Hsp70 and Hsp90 by human
   Hop1.}},

Abstract = {{Sonic hedgehog (Shh) has been implicated in the ongoing neurogenesis in
   postnatal rodent brains(1,2). Here we adopted an in vivo genetic
   fate-mapping strategy, using Gli1 (GLI-Kruppel family member) as a
   sensitive readout of Shh activity, to systematically mark and follow the
   fate of Shh-responding cells in the adult mouse forebrain. We show that
   initially, only a small population of cells ( including both quiescent
   neural stem cells and transit-amplifying cells) responds to Shh in
   regions undergoing neurogenesis. This population subsequently expands
   markedly to continuously provide new neurons in the forebrain. Our study
   of the behaviour of quiescent neural stem cells provides in vivo
   evidence that they can self-renew for over a year and generate multiple
   cell types. Furthermore, we show that the neural stem cell niches in the
   subventricular zone and dentate gyrus are established sequentially and
   not until late embryonic stages.}},

Abstract = {{The structural and magnetic properties of the perovskite type compound
   LaFe0.5Cr0.5O3 have been studied by temperature dependent neutron powder
   diffraction and magnetization measurements. Rietveld refinement of the
   neutron diffraction data shows that the compound crystallizes in an
   orthorhombic perovskite structure with a random positioning of the Fe
   and Cr cations at the B sublattice. The magnetic structure at 10 K is a
   collinear antiferromagnetic one with the magnetic moment per site being
   equal to 2.79(4) mu(B). Magnetisation measurements confirm the overall
   antiferromagnetic behaviour. Moreover, it indicates a weak uncompensated
   magnetic moment close to the transition temperature T-N approximate to
   265 K. This moment can be described by a magnetic cluster state, which
   remains up to 550 K. Electron diffraction patterns along with
   high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images reveal that the
   crystallites are composed by domains of different orientation, which
   share the same cubic perovskite sub-cell reflections. (C) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The mitogenic effect of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) on the breast is mediated
   by estrogen receptor alfa (ER alpha), hence ER alpha antagonists are
   effective in the treatment of breast cancer. The possible use of
   estrogen receptor beta (ER beta) as a target in treatment of breast
   cancer is under investigation. The mouse mammary cell line HC11
   expresses both ERs and was used to study the role of the two receptors
   in proliferation. E2 had no effect on proliferation. The ER
   alpha-selective agonist 4,4',4''-(4- propyl-(1H)- pyrazole- 1,3,5-triyl)
   trisphenol (PPT) stimulated proliferation. The ER beta-selective agonist
   2,3-bis(4-hydroxy-phenyl)- propionitrile (DPN) inhibited cell growth and
   induced apoptosis. PPT upregulated while DPN downregulated cyclin D1 and
   proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Upon inhibition of ER alpha
   expression with RNA interference, E2 caused a decrease in cyclin D1 and
   PCNA, and increased apoptosis. When ER beta expression was blocked, E2
   induced proliferation and cells gained the capacity to grow in soft
   agar. In summary, in HC11 mammary epithelial cells, ER alpha drives
   proliferation in response to E2 while ER beta is growth inhibitory. The
   lack of effect of E2 on HC11 cell growth is the result of the combined
   actions of ER alpha (proliferation) and ER beta (apoptosis). We suggest
   that use of ER beta agonists will be a useful addition in treatment of
   breast cancer, which, at present, is only aimed at inhibition of ER
   alpha.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic Stokes' shift measurements using coumarin 153 as the
   fluorescence probe have been carried out to explore the effect of added
   electrolyte, lithium chloride (LiCl), on solvation dynamics in the
   Triton-X-100 (TX-100) micelle and thus to understand the changes in
   micellar Palisade layer, especially the entrapped water structures in
   the Palisade layer. At all concentrations of LiCl, the spectral shift
   correlation function shows biexponential decay. At lower LiCl
   concentrations, the longer solvation time is seen to decrease, although
   the shorter solvation time is not affected much. At higher LiCl
   concentrations, both longer and shorter solvation times increase with
   electrolyte concentration. The present observations have been
   rationalized assuming two possible modes of interaction of the Li+ ions
   in the micellar palisade layer. For LiCl concentrations below about 1.5
   M, the Li+ ions appear to bind preferably to the ether groups of
   surfactant molecules, and the increased micellar hydration with the
   added salt effectively makes the solvation dynamics faster. At higher
   LiCl concentrations, available ether binding sites for the Li+ ions seem
   to get occupied effectively and the excess Li+ ions start remaining in
   the Palisade layer as strongly hydrated free ions. Because of strong
   hydration of the Li+ ions, the mobility of the entrapped water molecules
   in the micellar Palisade layer decreases significantly, causing the
   solvation dynamics to slow at higher LiCl concentrations. The
   fluorescence anisotropy results in the present systems are also in
   support of the above inferences drawn from solvation dynamics results.
   The present results with LiCl salt are found to be substantially
   different than those obtained in our earlier study (Kumbhakar et al. J.
   Phys. Chem. B 2005, 109, 14168) with salts such as NaCl, KCl, and CsCl.
   These differences are attributed mainly to the binding of the Li+ ions
   with the surfactant ether groups, which seems to be unlikely for the
   other alkali cations.}},

Abstract = {{The paper introduces a systematic procedure to coarse-grain atomistic
   models of the largest family of synthetic polymers into a mesoscopic

   force-field contains three different bonds, six angle and three
   nonbonded terms. Recently developed analytical potentials, based on sums
   of Gaussians for bond and angle terms of the mesoscale force field have
   been used. For the nonbonded part, numerical potentials optimized by
   pressure-corrected iterative Boltzmann inversion have been used. As test
   case we coarse-grained an atomistic all-atom model of atactic
   polystyrene. The proposed mesoscale model has been successfully tested
   against structural and dynamical properties for different chain lengths

   changes in mean since 1990 are found for the summer season, both in
   observations and climate models. Estimates for variability changes show
   a weak increase ( decrease) in summer ( winter), but these changes are
   not statistically significant at the 90\% level. For the 21st century
   all climate scenario runs suggest large relative increases in mean for
   all seasons with maximum amplitude in summer. Although changes in
   relative variability vary substantially between the models, there is a
   tendency for increasing ( decreasing) variability in future summers (

   equivalent to CR](+) (trpy = 2,2', 6',2{''}-terpyridine; R = H (1),
   CH2OH (2), and C6H5 (3)) are studied by ab initio and DFT methods. The
   ground- and excited-state structures are optimized by the MP2 and CIS
   methods, respectively. The absorption and emission spectra in the
   dichloromethane solution are obtained by using TD-DFT (B3LYP) method
   associated with the PCM model. The calculations indicate that, for 1-3,
   the variation of the substituents on the acetylide ligand only slightly
   changes their structures in ground and excited states but leads to a
   sizable difference in the electronic structures. In both cases of
   absorption and emission, the energy levels of HOMOs for 1-3 are
   sensitive to the substituents on acetylide ligand and increase obviously
   with the introduction of the electron-donating groups; however, those of
   trpy-based LUMOs vary slightly. The lowest-energy emissions are
   attributed to triplet acetylide/Pt -> trpy charge transfer
   ((LLCT)-L-3/(MLCT)-M-3) transitions and the lowest-energy absorptions
   and emissions for 1-3 are red-shifted on the order of 1 < 2 < 3 when the
   electron-donating groups are introduced into the acetylide ligand. By
   comparison of the results obtained by using different functionals in
   TD-DFT method, the calculations indicate that the exchange-correlation
   functionals (B3LYP, B3P86 and B3PW91) involving Becke three parameter
   hybrid functionals are appropriate for the terpyridyl platinum(II)
   acetylide complexes to get the relatively satisfactory results for the
   absorption spectra. The underestimated excitation energies of
   lowest-lying absorption bands are probably due to insufficient
   flexibility in TD-DFT method to describe states with large charge
   transfer.}},

Abstract = {{The Resilient Packet Ring (RPR), defined under IEEE 802.17, has been
   proposed as a high-speed backbone technology for metropolitan area
   networks. RPR is introduced to mitigate the underutilization and
   unfairness problems associated with the current technologies, SONET and
   Ethernet, respectively. The key performance objectives of RPR are to
   achieve high bandwidth utilization, optimum spatial reuse on the dual
   rings, and fairness. The challenge is to design an algorithm that can
   react dynamically to the traffic flows in achieving these objectives.
   The RPR fairness algorithm is comparatively simple, but it poses some
   critical limitations that require further investigation and remedy. One
   of the major problems is that the amount of bandwidth allocated by the
   algorithm oscillates severely under unbalanced traffic scenarios. These
   oscillations are barrier to achieving spatial reuse and high bandwidth
   utilization. DVSR was another algorithm proposed to solve the fairness
   issue with no oscillation at the steady state, but at the expense of a
   high computational complexity O(NlogN), where N is the number of nodes
   in the ring.
   In this paper, we propose the Distributed Bandwidth Allocation (DBA)
   algorithm to allocate bandwidth fairly to RPR nodes with a very low
   computational complexity O(l) that will converge to the exact max-min
   fairness in a few round trip times with no oscillation at the steady
   state. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Rat pups that are repeatedly handled and separated from their dam
   exhibit altered adult behavioral, endocrine, and autonomic responses to
   stress, but the extent to which early handling and/or maternal
   separation (H/S) alters the development of circuits that underlie these
   responses is unknown. The present study tested the hypothesis that early
   H/S alters the postnatal assembly of synapses within preautonomic
   emotional motor circuits. Circuit development was traced by
   synapse-dependent retrograde transneuronal transport of pseudorabies
   virus (PRV) from the stomach wall. Control and H/S rats were analyzed
   between postnatal day 6 (P6) and P10, a period of rapid synaptic
   assembly among preautonomic circuit components. Pups in H/S groups were
   removed from their dam daily for either 15 min or 3 h beginning on P1,
   and were injected with virus on P8 and perfused on P10. Quantitative
   analyses of primary and transsynaptic PRV immunolabeling confirmed an
   age-dependent assembly of hypothalamic, limbic, and cortical inputs to
   autonomic nuclei. Circuit assembly was significantly altered in H/S
   pups, in which fewer neurons in the central amygdala, the bed nucleus of
   the stria terminalis, and visceral cortices were infected compared with
   age-matched controls. In contrast, H/S did not alter the assembly of
   paraventricular hypothalamic inputs to gastric autonomic neurons.
   H/S-related reductions in limbic and cortical transneuronal infection
   were similar in pups exposed daily to 15 min or 3 h maternal separation.
   These findings support the view that environmental events during early
   postnatal life can influence the formation of neural circuits that
   provide limbic and cortical control over autonomic emotional motor
   output.}},

Abstract = {{The electrooxidative and -reductive methods for the surface modification

   treated under cathodic conditions in the presence of various kinds of
   electrophiles such as alkyl halides and alkyl tosylates introducing the
   alkyl groups on the carbon fiber. The changes of the functional groups
   on the carbon fibers were confirmed by the X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS) study and the observation of the hydrophilicity. The
   functional carbon fiber electrode introduced beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD)
   was then prepared by this electrochemical method. The electroreduction
   of acetophenone (1) was carried out using the resulting carbon fibers as
   cathodes. The use of the carbon fiber modified with beta-CD gave
   relatively high dl selectivity of the reductive coupling products 2 (the
   dl/meso ratio: 5.2), while the dl/meso ratio using the untreated carbon
   fiber was 3.0, and the formation of 1-phenyl ethanol (3) was observed
   only by using the beta-CD-modified carbon fiber. The observed products

Title = {{Chronic administration of olmesartan attenuates the exaggerated pressor

Abstract = {{It has been shown that the pressor responses to microinjection of
   L-glutamate in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) are augmented in
   spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), and that these augmented
   responses are not altered by chronic conventional anti hypertensive
   treatment. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of
   chronic oral treatment with a new angiotensin 11 type 1 (AT(1)) receptor
   antagonist, RNH-6270 (the active form of olmesartan medoxomil), on
   cardiovascular responses to excitatory amino acids in the RVLM of SHR.
   SHR (12 weeks old) were treated with RNH-6270 (30 mg/kg/day) or vehicle
   for 4 weeks. At 16 weeks of age, L-glutamate (2 nmol),
   N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA; an ionotropic glutamate receptor agonist (20
   pmol)), or (1S,3R)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid
   ((1S,3R)-ACPD; a metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist (1 nmol)) was
   microinjected into the RVLM of rats. The pressor responses to
   microinjection of L-glutamate or NMDA in the RNH-6270-treated SHR (+28.3
   +/- 1.0 and +483 +/- 2.5 mm Hg, respectively) were significantly smaller
   than those in untreated SHR (+45.7 +/- 2.2 and +69.4 +/- 7.0 mm Hg,
   respectively, P < 0.05 each); however, they were still greater than
   those in the Wistar-Kyoto rats (+21.7 +/- 1.0 and +28.6 +/- 3.3 min Hg,
   respectively, P < 0.05 each). In contrast, the augmented pressor
   responses to microinjection of (1S,3R)-ACPD in SHR were not affected by
   the RNH-6270 treatment. These results demonstrated that chronic oral
   treatment with RNH-6270, an AT, receptor antagonist, partly normalizes

Title = {{Interaction between the movement protein of barley yellow dwarf virus

Abstract = {{The open reading frame 4 (ORF 4) gene product of barley yellow dwarf
   virus (BYDV) may act as a movement protein (MP) by assisting the
   transport of viral genomic RNA across the nuclear envelope (NE) of host
   plant cells. To investigate interactions between BYDV MP and the NE,
   wild-type and mutant open reading frame ORF 4-green fluorescent protein
   (GFP) fusion cistrons were expressed in insect cells. A fusion protein
   expressed by the wild-type ORF 4-GFP cistron associated with the NE and
   caused protrusions from its surface. The fusion protein expressed by the
   mutant ORF 4-GFP cistron lacked a putative amphiphilic alpha-helix at
   its N-terminus and although associating with the NE, showed decreased
   levels of protrusions. A peptide homologue of this putative a-helix
   induced an increase of 7 degrees C in the phase transition temperature
   of dimyrystoyl phosphatidylserine (DMPS) membranes, accompanied by a
   decrease in membrane fluidity, but exhibited no significant interaction
   with either dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) or dimyristoyl
   phosphatidylethanolamine (DMPE) membranes. These results strongly
   support the view that BYDV MP may interact with the NE to help transport
   viral genomic RNA into the nuclear compartment. This function of BYDV MP
   appears to involve protrusions on the surface of the NE and may require
   the presence of an N-terminal amphiphilic alpha-helix, which is
   speculated to destabilize membranes, thereby assisting the entry of
   BYDV-GAV into the nuclear compartment. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Plexin signaling is required for stereotyped pruning of long axon
   collaterals in the vertebrate CNS; however, a cellular basis for plexins
   on stereotyped pruning has not been determined. Using quantitative
   electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry, we found that
   infra-pyramidal mossy fiber axon collaterals form transient synaptic
   complexes with basal dendrites of CA3 pyramidal cells in the early
   postnatal mouse hippocampus. At later postnatal ages, these synaptic
   complexes stop maturing and are removed before stereotyped pruning by a
   mechanism that does not involve axon degeneration and glial cell
   engulfment. In knock-out mice that lack plexin-A3 signaling, the
   synaptic complexes continue to mature, and, as a result, the collaterals
   are not pruned. Thus, our results suggest that intact plexin-A3
   signaling contributes to synaptic complex elimination, which is
   associated with stereotyped axon pruning.}},

Abstract = {{Among the characteristics of future wireless networks is the desire to
   support a wide range of wireless users and a diverse set of services
   from many different types of networks. One of the most often referenced
   networking protocols for diverse wireless and mobile networking is
   Mobile IP. Although recent focus has been on developing a micro-mobility
   architecture for Mobile IP, an emerging need is to enhance the unifying
   performance of Mobile IP by using a cross-layer, cross-technology,
   approach to protocol design, in order to serve a wide variety of users,
   services and networks. This paper provides a survey of recently proposed
   performance enhancements for Mobile IP and discusses the impact on
   network-level performance. After a review of the Mobile IP architecture,
   recent research on reducing handoff latency is discussed, including the
   use of layer 2 hints. Then, location registration is explored, including
   new techniques for authentication of mobile users. Finally, an overview
   of performance analysis models is provided to show the most recent
   approaches to determining the impact of mobility on a given network. (c)

Abstract = {{A combination of two microstrip-line resonators, which are partially
   coupled, are considered in a parallel partially coupled-line banapass
   filter (BPF), where one resonator is one half-wavelength (lambda/2)
   long, and the other (whose one end is grounded) is only one
   quarter-wavelength (lambda/4) long. Therefore, the length of a
   coupled-line section can be varied based on the position of the grounded
   end. Five conditions of the movable coupling length are simulated, which
   greatly influences the spurious responses of the BPF. This property is
   numerically investigated in this paper. The analysis shows that, based
   on the grounding position, this method is capable of realizing improved
   out-of band characteristics by locating the multiple attenuation poles
   in the stopband and improved spurious responses up to five times of the
   passband frequency (5f(0)) of a parallel partially coupled-line BPF. An
   empirical model of the BPF is fabricated, and the numerical results are

Abstract = {{Compounds possessing antioxidant activity play a crucial role in
   delaying or preventing lipid oxidation in foods and beverages during
   processing and storage. Such reactions lead to loss of product quality,
   especially as a consequence of off-flavor formation. The aim of this
   study was to determine the antioxidant activity of kilned (standard) and
   roasted (speciality) malts in relation to phenolic compounds, sugars,
   amino acids, and color {[}assessed as European Brewing Convention units
   (degrees EBC) and absorbance at 420 nm]. The concentrations of sugars
   and amino acids decreased with the intensity of the applied heat
   treatment, and this was attributed to the extent of the Maillard
   reaction, as well as sugar caramelization, in the highly roasted malts.
   Proline, followed by glutamine, was the most abundant free amino/imino
   acid in the malt samples, except those that were highly roasted, and
   maltose was the most abundant sugar in all malts. Levels of total
   phenolic compounds decreased with heat treatment. Catechin and ferulic
   acid were the most abundant phenolic compounds in the majority of the
   malts, and amounts were highest in the kilned samples. In highly roasted
   malts, degradation products of ferulic acid were identified. Antioxidant
   activity increased with the intensity of heating, in parallel with color
   formation, and was significantly higher for roasted malts compared to
   kilned malts. In kilned malts, phenolic compounds were the main
   identified contributors to antioxidant activity, with Maillard reaction
   products also playing a role. In roasted malts, Maillard reaction
   products were responsible for the majority of the antioxidant activity.}},

Abstract = {{Here we use Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat)-derived
   elevations and surface characteristics to investigate the Malaspina
   Glacier of southern Alaska. Although there is significant elevation
   variability between ICESat tracks on this glacier, we were able to
   discern general patterns in surface elevation change by using a regional
   digital elevation model (DEM) as a reference surface. Specifically, we
   report elevation differences between ICESat Laser 1 - 3 observations (
   February 2003 November 2004) and a Shuttle Radar Topography Mission
   (SRTM)-derived DEM from February 2000. Elevation decreases of up to 20 -
   25 m over a 3 - 4 year time period were observed across the folded loop
   moraine on the southern portion of the Malaspina Glacier.}},

Abstract = {{Fluoroalkyl end-capped trimethoxyvinylsilane oligomers,
   trimethoxyvinylsilane-N,N-dimethylacryl-amide cooligomers, and
   trimethoxyvinylsilane-acryloyl-morpholine cooligomers were polymerized
   with hydrolysis and condensation between tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) and
   trimethoxysilyl segments in oligomers to afford homogeneous fluoroalkyl
   end-capped oligomers/silica gel polymer hybrids under mild conditions.
   Similarly, fluoroalkyl end-capped N,N-dimethylacrylamide oligomers and
   acryloylmorpholine oligomers reacted with TEOS under mild conditions to
   afford the fluorinated oligomers/silica gel polymer hybrids. The
   formation of these fluorinated oligomers/silica gel polymer hybrids is
   due to the homogeneous incorporation of fluoroalkyl end-capped oligomers
   into the silica gel networks through the intermolecular hydrogen bonding
   interaction between the residual silanol groups in silica gels and amido
   groups of fluorinated oligomers. We have also succeeded in preparing new
   fluorinated polymer hybrids by the use of fluoroalkyl end-capped
   N,N-dimethylacrylamide co-oligomer-containing silsesquioxane segments.
   Thermal stability of a variety of fluoroalkyl end-capped
   oligomers/silica gel polymer hybrids thus obtained was found to increase
   significantly compared to those of the parent fluoroalkyl end-capped
   oligomers. In addition, in these fluorinated oligomers/silica gel
   polymer hybrids, their sol solutions are applicable to the surface
   modification of glass to exhibit not only a strong oleophobicity
   imparted by fluorine but also a good hydrophilicity on the glass
   surface. Therefore, these fluorinated oligomers/silica gel polymer
   hybrids are suggested to have high potential for new functional
   materials through their unique properties imparted by not only fluorine
   but also by the hybrid counterparts. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Month = {{OCT 5}},
Abstract = {{{[}1] As an important input for hydrological models and snowmelting
   models, surface solar radiation can be estimated from sunshine duration
   by the Angstrorm-Prescott model. This model has site-dependent
   parameters and thus needs calibrations when applied to individual
   regions. The calibrations are particularly difficult in highland and
   mountainous areas because of unavailability of radiation measurements.
   In this study, a simple model that can explicitly account for radiative
   transfer processes in the atmosphere is developed to estimate hourly and
   daily solar radiation. Its inputs are surface meteorological data (
   sunshine duration, air temperature, and relative humidity), so it can be
   easily applied to hydrological modeling. The radiation model is compared
   with the Food and Agricultural Organization radiation model and globally
   and locally calibrated Angstrorm-Prescott models at a number of sites in
   various climate and elevation regions, and it is suggested that the new
   model is more general and more accurate, especially for estimating
   hourly solar radiation. The source code of this model is available from
   the authors upon request.}},

Abstract = {{The glycogen synthase found in Pyrococcus furiosus is a
   hyperthermophilic biocatalyst that transfers the glucose portion of
   nucleotide-diphosphoglucose onto a growing carbohydrate biopolymer chain
   at 80 degrees C. In contrast to the mesophilic rabbit muscle glycogen
   synthase, the biocatalyst from P. furiosus possesses unusually broad
   nucleotide tolerance. The enzyme accepts all four common
   glucose-containing nucleotide-diphosphosugars: ADP-glucose, GDP-glucose,
   dTDP-glucose, and UDP-glucose. Using an electrospray ionization-mass
   spectroscopy (ESI-MS) assay, we determined the K-M and V-max for
   GDP-glucose to be 3.9 +/- 0.6 mM and 0.243 +/- 0.009 mM/min, and for
   dTDP-glucose to be 4.0 +/- 0.5 mM and 0.216 +/- 0.008 mM/min. A related
   nucleotide sugar, UDP-galactose, was not a reactive substrate, but was
   instead a competitive inhibitor with a K-i of 17 +/- 2 mM. The glycogen
   synthase from P. furiosus was shown not to have phosphorylase activity.
   The Delta Delta G of substrate binding was compared between the
   mesophilic rabbit muscle and the hyperthermophilic P. furiosus glycogen
   synthase to dissect any differences in sugar nucleotide recognition
   strategies at elevated temperatures. Both biocatalysts were shown to
   gain most of their substrate affinity through electrostatic interactions
   between the enzyme and the alpha-phosphate. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals,

   Of MoS2 stacks and number Of MoS2 layers per stack, which play important
   role on the HDN and HDS activities of these catalysts, were calculated.
   It was concluded that the decrease in MoS2 slab length caused an
   increase in catalyst activity for HDN of heavy gas oil derived from
   Athabasca bitumen. Computer simulation was also performed in order to
   correlate the surface morphology with catalyst activity. Maximum edge
   and corner Mo atoms which were responsible for high HDN and HDS

Abstract = {{Thoroughly equilibrated atomistic configurations of H-shaped
   polyethylene (PE) melts, obtained through a novel implementation of the
   double-bridging Monte Carlo algorithm {[}Karayiannis et al. J. Chem.
   Phys. 2003, 118, 2451], have been subjected to equilibrium NPT molecular
   dynamics (MD) simulations at T = 450 K and P = 1 atm, for times up to 4
   mu s. The simulated model H-shaped systems consist of PE chains
   possessing a main backbone (a ``crossbar{''}) trapped between two branch
   points each of which is linked to two dangling arms. In our simulations,
   the average number of carbon atoms in the backbone ranged from 48 up to
   300 corresponding to both unentangled and entangled crossbars, while the
   average arm length was kept relatively small (it ranged from 24 up to
   50) corresponding always to unentangled arms. Our long MD simulation
   studies reveal the different relaxation mechanisms exhibited by an
   H-polymer: the rapid relaxation due to arm breathing (on the order of a
   few nanoseconds for the short, unentangled arms considered here, UP to
   C-50) and the slow branch point diffusion (on the order of a few
   microseconds for the size of the entangled backbones considered here, UP
   to C-300), which, in turn, governs the sluggish diffusive motion of the
   entire H-molecule. Analysis of the curves describing the time decay of
   the autocorrelation functions for the unit vectors directed from the
   branch point to the free end of the arm and from one branch point to the
   other reveals a number of relaxation modes, indicative of the strong
   cooperativity between arm and backbone relaxations in H-shaped
   structures. It is further observed that once Fickian diffusion is
   established, the mean-square displacement (msd) of the chain
   center-of-mass follows remarkably faithfully that of branch points. This
   validates from first principles the assumption of the pom-pom model
   {[}Bishko et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1997, 79, 2352] that all friction in
   an H-polymer is concentrated at the two branch points. Values of the
   branch point friction coefficient, zeta(b), a significant parameter
   entering the pom-pom model, have also been calculated. For the longest
   H-polymers studied, logarithmic plots of the msd of the inner crossbar
   segments against time are seen to exhibit the four different regimes
   predicted by the reptation theory of Doi-Edwards for entangled linear
   polymer melts, with corresponding exponents remarkably close to those of
   the theory. This allowed us to extract the characteristic relaxation
   times tau(e), tau(R), and tau(d) of the theory for all simulated systems
   and the value of the effective diameter, a, of the underlying tube
   model.}},

Abstract = {{Background-The effects of estrogen on blood vessels are partly due to
   changes in vascular cell gene expression and protein synthesis that are
   mediated by estrogen receptors. In previous association studies, the
   -397T/C ( rs2234693) and -351A/G (rs9340799) single nucleotide
   polymorphisms in the estrogen receptor alpha gene ( ESR1) have been
   implicated in the risk of coronary atherosclerosis and myocardial
   infarction. To test these findings, we examined the relationship of the
   polymorphisms to myocardial infarction in a large sample of white
   patients and control individuals of predominantly European descent.
   Methods and Results-The case group included 3657 patients with
   myocardial infarction, and the control group comprised 1211 individuals
   with angiographically normal coronary arteries and without signs or
   symptoms of myocardial infarction. TaqMan assays were used for the
   determination of genotypes. Genotype distributions of the -397T/ C and
   -351A/G polymorphisms were not significantly different between the
   control and patient groups ( P >= 0.85). The frequencies of haplotypes
   defined by the -397T/ C and -351A/ G polymorphisms were similar in the
   control group and the patient group ( P = 0.42). In addition, the
   distributions of haplotype-defined genotypes (diplotypes) were not
   significantly different between the control group and the patient group
   ( P = 0.81). Separate analyses in women and men did not reveal
   sex-related associations of specific genotypes or haplotypes of the
   polymorphisms with myocardial infarction ( P >= 0.25).
   Conclusions - The results indicate that the -397T/C and -351A/G
   polymorphisms of ESR1 or haplotypes based on these polymorphisms are not
   associated with myocardial infarction in a white population.}},

Abstract = {{Three types of spinel-based cathode powders, namely, LiMn2O4,
   Li1.07Mn1.93O4, and Li1.06Al0.2Mn1.74O4, are examined with rotating
   ring-disc collection experiments to measure manganese dissolution and
   capacity losses in lithium-ion cells. The cyclic voltammograms are
   similar at high scan rates for all three electrodes. Initially, all
   electrodes rapidly lose capacity during cycling. After about 25 cycles,
   the electrodes start to exhibit capacity retention, and the performance
   matches that of the best spinels. The cation-substituted spinel
   electrodes experience a moderate capacity loss of 0.2\% per cycle over
   200 cycles, which is half that suffered by a typical spinel electrode
   (LiMnO4). Manganese (Mn) dissolution from all the spinel-based samples
   is monitored in situ under various conditions. The ring cathodic
   currents for the cation-substituted spinel electrodes are similar to
   those for LiMn2O4, which shows that the Mn dissolution behaviour is the
   same for all spinel-based cathode powders. The ring currents reach
   maximum values at the end-of charge (EOC) and end-of discharge (EOD),
   with the largest peak at EOC. The results suggest that the dissolution
   of Mn from all spinel-based samples occurs during charge-discharge
   cycling, especially in a charged state at >4.0 V and in a discharged
   state at <3.1 V In addition, lower ring cathodic currents are observed
   in the cation-substituted spinel cathodes and this indicates that the
   rate of dissolution of Mn has decreased in these materials. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Water-soluble quantum dots (qdots) are now being used in life sciences
   research to take advantage of their bright, easily excited fluorescence
   and high photostability. Although the frequent erratic blinking and
   substantial dark (never radiant) fractions that occur in all available
   qdots may interfere with many applications, these properties of
   individual particles in biological environments had not been fully
   evaluated. By labeling Qdot-streptavidin with organic dyes, we were able
   to distinguish individual dark and bright qdots and to observe blinking
   events as qdots freely diffused in aqueous solution. Bright fractions
   were measured by confocal fluorescence coincidence analysis (CFCA) and
   two-photon cross-correlation fluorescence correlation spectroscopy
   (FCS). The observed bright fractions of various preparations were
   proportional to the ensemble quantum yields (QYs), but the intrinsic
   brightness of individual qdots was found to be constant across samples
   with different QYs but the same emission wavelengths. Increasing qdots'
   illuminated dwell time by 10-fold during FCS did not change the fraction
   of apparently dark qdots but did increase the detected fraction of
   blinking qdots, suggesting that the dark population does not arise from
   millisecond blinking. Combining CFCA with wide-field imaging of arrays
   of qdots localized in dilute agarose gel, the blinking of qdots was
   measured across five orders of magnitude in time: approximate to
   0.001-100 s. This research characterizes photophysical pathologies of
   qdots in biologically relevant environments rather than adhered on
   dielectric surfaces and describes methods that are useful for studying
   various bioapplicable nanoparticles.}},

Abstract = {{We present an analytical calculation of the leading three-loop radiative
   correction to the S-parameter in the standard model in the large Higgs
   mass limit. Numerically, S-(3) = 1.1105 x g(4) / (1024 pi(3)) x m(H)(4)
   / M-W(4). When combined with the corresponding three-loop correction to
   the p- parameter, this leads to shifts of Delta((3))
   sin(2)theta(lept)(eff) = 4.6 x 10(-9) x m(H)(4) / M-W(4) in the
   effective weak mixing angle and Delta M-(3)(W) = -6.3 x 10(-4) MeV x
   m(H)(4) / M-W(4) in the W-boson mass. For both of these observables, the
   sign of the three-loop correction is equal to that of the one-loop

Abstract = {{We introduce the notion of temporal superresolution for ultrashort laser
   pulses, by analogy with the well-known method of optical superresolution
   in imaging systems. Simple linear spectral masks are presented, that
   shape a laser pulse into a central peak of very short duration, well
   below the Fourier limited width of Gaussian pulses, but accompagnied by
   low intensity satellite pulses. A proof-of-principle experiment is
   presented, using a short pulse, high intensity laser system. Such lasers
   may induce very strongly non linear phenomena in laser-matter
   interactions, suppressing the effect of the satellite pulses and
   therefore fully mimicking shorter light pulses. As an example, we show
   theoretically that the field ionization asymmetry induced by cosine few
   cycle pulses is strongly enhanced using temporally superresolved laser
   pulses. (c) 2005 Optical Society of America.}},

Abstract = {{The roles of monoclonal antibody affinity and treatment time of
   (+)-methamphetamine-induced pharmacological effects in rats were studied
   using two anti-(+)-methamphetamine monoclonal antibodies. These studies
   tested the preclinical protective effects of monoclonal antibody
   antagonists in (+)-methamphetamine overdose and pretreatment scenarios.
   The higher affinity antibody (mAb6H4; K-D = 11 nM for
   (+)-methamphetamine) more effectively antagonized
   (+)-methamphetamine-induced behavioral effects (distance and rearing)
   than the low affinity antibody (designated mAb6HS; K-D = 250 nM) and had
   a longer duration of action. Both antibodies more effectively reduced
   (+)methamphetamine effects in the overdose model than in the
   pretreatment model. (+)-Methamphetamine pharmacokinetic studies showed
   the mAb6H4 significantly reduced brain concentrations over time in both
   models. However, while mAb6H4 immediately reduced brain concentrations
   in the overdose model, it did not prevent the initial distribution of
   (+)-methamphetamine into the brain in the pretreatment model. Thus,
   anti-(+)-methamphetamine monoclonal antibody affinity and administration
   time (relative to (+)-methamphetamine dosing) are critical determinants
   of therapeutic success. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A branch arm filtering technique is firstly proposed and experimentally

   arrangement improves the efficiency of the laser without obvious
   spectral quality penalty. The laser can be tuned from 1530 nm to 1570 nm
   with little power fluctuation, which is limited by the tuning range of
   the filter. A novel scaling scheme is also proposed, allowing the
   technique to be applied to the tuning of an extremely high power laser
   with a low power filter. The technique is expected to be compatible with
   other kinds of lasers such as linearly polarized lasers, Michelson type
   resonator and bulk lasers as well. (c) 2005 Optical Society of America.}},

Title = {{High-throughput metal susceptibility testing of microbial biofilms}},
Journal = {{BMC MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: Microbial biofilms exist all over the natural world, a
   distribution that is paralleled by metal cations and oxyanions. Despite
   this reality, very few studies have examined how biofilms withstand
   exposure to these toxic compounds. This article describes a batch
   culture technique for biofilm and planktonic cell metal susceptibility
   testing using the MBEC assay. This device is compatible with standard
   96-well microtiter plate technology. As part of this method, a two part,
   metal specific neutralization protocol is summarized. This procedure
   minimizes residual biological toxicity arising from the carry-over of
   metals from challenge to recovery media. Neutralization consists of
   treating cultures with a chemical compound known to react with or to
   chelate the metal. Treated cultures are plated onto rich agar to allow
   metal complexes to diffuse into the recovery medium while bacteria
   remain on top to recover. Two difficulties associated with metal
   susceptibility testing were the focus of two applications of this
   technique. First, assays were calibrated to allow comparisons of the
   susceptibility of different organisms to metals. Second, the effects of
   exposure time and growth medium composition on the susceptibility of E.
   coli JM109 biofilms to metals were investigated.
   Results: This high-throughput method generated 96-statistically
   equivalent biofilms in a single device and thus allowed for comparative
   and combinatorial experiments of media, microbial strains, exposure
   times and metals. By adjusting growth conditions, it was possible to
   examine biofilms of different microorganisms that had similar cell
   densities. In one example, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 was up to
   80 times more resistant to heavy metalloid oxyanions than Escherichia
   coli TG1. Further, biofilms were up to 133 times more tolerant to
   tellurite ( TeO32-) than corresponding planktonic cultures. Regardless
   of the growth medium, the tolerance of biofilm and planktonic cell E.
   coli JM109 to metals was time-dependent.
   Conclusion: This method results in accurate, easily reproducible
   comparisons between the susceptibility of planktonic cells and biofilms
   to metals. Further, it was possible to make direct comparisons of the
   ability of different microbial strains to withstand metal toxicity. The
   data presented here also indicate that exposure time is an important
   variable in metal susceptibility testing of bacteria.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss the definition and the energy evolution of scattering
   amplitudes with C-odd ({''}odderon{''}) quantum numbers within the
   effective theory for the color glass condensate (CGC) endowed with the
   functional, JIMWLK, evolution equation. We explicitly construct
   gauge-invariant amplitudes describing multiple odderon exchanges in the
   scattering between the CGC and two types of projectiles: a color-singlet
   quark-antiquark pair (or `color dipole') and a system of three quarks in
   a colorless state. We deduce the energy evolution of these amplitudes
   from the general JIMWLK equation, which for this purpose is recast in a
   more synthetic form, which is manifestly infrared finite. For the dipole
   odderon, we confirm and extend the non-linear evolution equations
   recently proposed by Kovchegov, Szymanowski and Wallon, which couple the
   evolution of the odderon to that of the pomeron, and predict the rapid
   suppression of the odderon exchanges in the saturation regime at high
   energy. For the 3-quark system, we focus on the linear regime at
   relatively low energy, where our general equations are shown to reduce
   to the Bartels-Kwiecinski-Praszalowicz equation. Our gauge-invariant
   amplitudes, and the associated evolution equations, stay explicitly
   outside the Mobius representation, which is the Hilbert space where the
   BFKL Hamiltonian exhibits holomorphic separability. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Recent studies have led to considerable advancement in our understanding
   of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the relentless cell growth and
   invasiveness of human gliomas. Partial understanding of these mechanisms
   has ( 1) improved the classification for gliomas, by identifying
   prognostic subgroups, and ( 2) pointed to novel potential therapeutic
   targets. Some classes of ion channels have turned out to be involved in
   the pathogenesis and malignancy of gliomas. We studied the expression
   and properties of K+ channels in primary cultures obtained from surgical
   specimens: human ether a go-go related (hERG) 1 voltage-dependent K+
   channels, which have been found to be overexpressed in various human
   cancers, and human ether a go-go-like 2 channels, that share many of
   hERG1 s biophysical features. The expression pattern of these two
   channels was compared to that of the classical inward rectifying K+
   channels, IRK, that are widely expressed in astrocytic cells and
   classically considered a marker of astrocytic differentiation. In our
   study, hERG1 was found to be specifically overexpressed in high-grade
   astrocytomas, that is, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). In addition, we
   present evidence that, in GBM cell lines, hERG1 channel activity
   actively contributes to malignancy by promoting vascular endothelial
   growth factor secretion, thus stimulating the neoangiogenesis typical of
   high-grade gliomas. Our data provide important confirmation for studies
   proposing the hERG1 channel as a molecular marker of tumour progression
   and a possible target for novel anticancer therapies.}},

Abstract = {{The mushroom Inonotus obliquus (Fr.) Pilat (Hymenochaetaceae), has been
   traditionally used for the treatment of gastrointestinal cancer,
   cardiovascular disease and diabetes in Russia, Poland and most of Baltic
   countries. This study was designed to investigate the anti-inflammatory
   and anti-nociceptive effects of the methanol extract from Inonotus
   obliquus (MEIO) in vivo and in vitro. MEIO (100 or 200 mg/(kg day),
   p.o.) reduced acute paw edema induced by carrageenin in rats, and showed
   analgesic activity, as determined by an acetic acid-induced abdominal
   constriction test and a hot plate test in mice. To reveal the mechanism
   of the anti-inflammatory effect of MEIO, we examined its effect on
   lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced responses in a murine macrophage cell
   line RAW 264.7. MEIO was found to significantly inhibit the productions
   of nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) and tumor necrosis
   factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages.
   Consistent with these observations, MEIO potently inhibited the protein
   and mRNA expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and
   cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Furthermore, MEIO inhibited the LPS-induced
   DNA binding activity of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B), and this
   was associated with the prevention of inhibitor kappa B degradation and
   a reduction in nuclear p65 protein levels. Taken together, our data
   indicate that the anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive properties of
   MEIO may be due to the inhibition of iNOS and COX-2 expression via the
   down-regulation of NF-kappa B binding activity. (C) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Thin (similar to 10 nm) AlN interlayers have previously been used to
   mitigate stress and cracking in GaN epitaxial layers grown on Si
   substrates. However, multiple AlN interlayers are typically required for
   the growth of thick (>1 mu m) GaN as the initial compressive mismatch
   stress introduced by the AlN interlayer transitions to a tensile stress
   within 0.5 mu m. To better understand the reasons for the transition, in
   situ monitoring and transmission electron microscopy have been used to
   study stress and structural evolution in undoped GaN layers deposited on
   high temperature (1050-1100 degrees C) AlN interlayers by metal-organic
   chemical-vapor deposition. The results show that transition of the
   initial compressive stress to a final tensile stress is associated with

Abstract = {{Korean ginseng tea (KGT), prepared from the roots of Panax ginseng, is
   widely used by Korean people for antistress, antifatigue, and endurance
   promoting effects. In the present study we evaluated
   neuroprotective/cerebroprotective actions of KGT in stroke, using rat
   global and focal models of ischemia. Varied biochemical/enzymatic
   alterations, produced subsequent to the application of middle cerebral
   artery (MCAO) and bilateral carotid artery occlusion (BCAO) followed by
   reperfusion viz. increase in lipid peroxidation (LPO) and decrease in
   glutathione (GSH), glutathione reductase (GR), catalase (CAT),
   glutathione-S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and
   superoxide dismutase (SOD), were markedly reversed and restored to near
   normal levels in the groups pre-treated with KGT (350 mg/kg given orally
   for 10 days). It is concluded that the protective action, exhibited by
   KGT against hypoperfusion/reperfusion induced brain injury, suggests its
   therapeutic potential in cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) including
   stroke. These findings are important because: (a) the present treatment
   strategies for CVD are far from adequate and (b) KGT with wide usage is
   known to be a safe natural product. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Apolipoprotein A-1 (apo A-1), a major component of high density
   lipoproteins, has been shown to be involved in lipid metabolism,
   cholesterol homeostasis and degeneration/regeneration of brain tissues
   and was proposed as a useful marker for the extent and severity of CNS
   injury. We searched for aberrant protein expression in hippocampus from
   patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) by an analytical
   method based on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass
   spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF) and unambiguously identified 2 spots as
   apolipoprotein A-1 forms in brain of MTLE patients with 7.5-fold
   increased levels (controls: 0.046 +/- 0.046; MTLE patients: 0.343 +/-
   0.154, mean +/- SD, P = 0.003). Western blot analysis confirmed
   increased apo A-1 levels in MTLE. Immunchistochemistry detected staining
   for apo A-1 extracellularly in perivasal brain parenchyma, neuropil and
   areas with increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression
   as well as some pyramidal neurons and subpial astrocytes. These findings
   indicate that the increase of apo A-1 in MTLE was possibly not
   reflecting a pathogenetic role but was rather due to extravasates,
   bleedings or increase of microvascular endothelial cells known to
   synthesize apo A-1. Care has to be taken when protein expressional
   findings are to be interpreted in the presence of plasma proteins,
   including apo A-1, thus clearly representing a confounding factor. (c)

Abstract = {{Fundamental to the creation of a hydrogen economy is a viable, safe and
   affordable hydrogen-energy-system. Examining carefully some of the key
   properties of hydrogen that are related to fire and explosion, it is
   found that hydrogen is combustible over a wide range of concentrations.
   At atmospheric pressure, it is combustible at concentrations from 4\% to
   74.2\% by volume. It has the highest flame velocity of any gas and its
   ignition energy is very low, which is 32\% less than methane gas.
   In this paper, the problem of ``safe hydrogen{''} is tackled using a new
   theoretical approach. Hydrogen is mixed with predetermined amounts of
   methane gas and to be sold as ``Hydrothane{''}. The properties of this
   mixture-most important are the flame speed, lower explosion limit (LEL)
   and upper explosion limit (UEL) are to be developed as a function of the
   ratio of the hydrogen-methane.
   The maximum flame speed, cm/s, for a selected number of hydrocarbons
   along with the corresponding volume percentage of combustible mixture
   (fuel in air) are used in the proposed analysis. In addition, Le
   Chatelier's law is used to predict limits of flammability of the
   Hydrothane. (c) 2005 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

Title = {{Nonsurgical delay of dorsal rat cutaneous flap using a long-pulsed
   1064-nm Nd : YAG laser with a contact cooling device}},

Abstract = {{Background: This study evaluated the efficiency of a long-pulsed
   neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser, operating at 1064 nm and
   equipped with a contact cooling device, in the delay of a caudally based
   dorsal rat skin flap (10 x 3 cm). This laser has deeper tissue
   penetration and has not been used for this purpose before.
   Methods: Twelve male Sprague-Dawley rats were used in each of six
   groups. The delay effects of three different laser treatment patterns
   (only longitudinal borders, cephalic and longitudinal borders, and
   entire surface of the 10 x 3-cm flap) were compared with an acute
   untreated control flap as well as two surgical delay methods (incision
   of longitudinal borders and incision of longitudinal borders plus flap
   undermining). The laser effects on the cutaneous vasculature and
   perfusion were assessed by intravenous fluorescein injection, histologic
   study, rn.icroangiography, and in vivo real-time video monitoring.
   Results: Selective thern-Locoagulation of subdermal vessels was achieved
   using a 6-mm spot, 140-J/cm(2) fluence, and 40-mscc pulse width. In the
   cephalic and longitudinal borders laser-treated group, a delay effect
   was achieved. The maximum delay effect was achieved by the surgical
   delay group that used the method of incision of the longitudinal borders
   plus flap undermining. Laser treatment of only the longitudinal borders
   did not improve flap survival, whereas treatment of the entire flap
   surface significantly reduced flap survival.
   Conclusion: Nonsurgical delay of a dorsal rat cutaneous flap is possible
   by selective occlusion of the subdermal plexus at the longitudinal and
   cephalic borders of the planned flap using a long pulsed 1064-nm
   neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser equipped With a contact cooling
   device.}},

Abstract = {{Recent empirical studies by Alvarez and Nagler, Erikson and Romero, and

   candidates/parties can win elections even when their policies differ
   sharply from the policy beliefs of the constituencies that elect them.
   This raises the question: How can voters exercise control over
   government policies via elections? We report applications to American
   and French presidential election data that suggest three paradoxical
   conclusions. On the one hand, we find that presidential candidates can
   moderate their policies with at most a modest change in vote share, but
   if they move by the same amount to a more extreme position, they face
   severe vote losses that could cripple their election prospects.
   Alternatively, movement by both candidates in the same direction or a
   policy shift by the voters may have a major effect on the outcome.}},

   lacuna by constructing and analyzing a new data set on international

   poverty in the developing world. After instrumenting for the possible
   endogeneity of international migration, and controlling for various
   factors, results suggest that, on average, a 10\% increase in the share
   of international migrants in a country's population will lead to a 2.1\%
   decline in the share of people living on less than \$1.00 per person per
   day. After instrumenting for the possible endogeneity of international
   remittances, a similar 10\% increase in per capita official
   international remittances will lead to a 3.5\% decline in the share of

Abstract = {{This three year longitudinal study examined the cognitive performance of
   247 individuals who recently presented with a first episode of
   psychosis. Using a comprehensive battery of cognitive tests, we assessed
   cognition at baseline, I year and 2-year follow-ups. Assessments also
   included positive and negative symptoms, depression, social outcome and
   substance use. There were several significant improvements in cognition
   over the two-year period which were usually matched by improvements in a
   matched non-psychiatric control group. Regression analyses demonstrated
   that after controlling for symptoms cognitive impairment accounted for
   4-6\% of the variance in social functioning. Our results suggest that
   impaired cognition exists in the very early stages of a psychotic
   illness and that there is no decline over time. Secondly, our results
   suggest that, although related, poor social functioning deficits may be
   independent of cognitive impairment. Finally there are implications for
   improved methodology in the assessment of both cognitive and social
   functioning. (c) 2005 Elsevier BV All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{126}},

Abstract = {{Endogenous serine proteases have been reported to control the
   reabsorption of Na+ by kidney- and lung-derived epithelial cells via
   stimulation of electrogenic Na+ transport mediated by the epithelial Na+
   channel ( ENaC). In this study we investigated the effects of aprotinin
   on ENaC single channel properties using transepithelial fluctuation
   analysis in the amphibian kidney epithelium, A6. Aprotinin caused a
   time- and concentration-dependent inhibition (84 +/- 10.5\%) in the
   amiloride-sensitive sodium transport (I-Na) with a time constant of 18
   min and half maximal inhibition constant of 1 mu M. Analysis of
   amiloride analogue blocker-induced fluctuations in I-Na showed linear
   rate-concentration plots with identical blocker on and off rates in
   control and aprotinin-inhibited conditions. Verification of open-block
   kinetics allowed for the use of a pulse protocol method (Helman, S. I.,
   X. Liu, K. Baldwin, B. L. Blazer-Yost, and W. J. Els. 1998. Am. J.
   Physiol. 274: C947-C957) to study the same cells under different
   conditions as well as the reversibility of the aprotinin effect on
   single channel properties. Aprotinin caused reversible changes in all
   three single channel properties but only the change in the number of
   open channels was consistent with the inhibition of I-Na. A 50\%
   decrease in I-Na was accompanied by 50\% increases in the single channel
   current and open probability but an 80\% decrease in the number of open
   channels. Washout of aprotinin led to a time- dependent restoration of
   I-Na as well as the single channel properties to the control,
   pre-aprotinin, values. We conclude that protease regulation of I-Na is
   mediated by changes in the number of open channels in the apical
   membrane. The increase in the single channel current caused by protease
   inhibition can be explained by a hyperpolarization of the apical
   membrane potential as active Na+ channels are retrieved. The paradoxical
   increase in channel open probability caused by protease inhibition will
   require further investigation but does suggest a potential compensatory
   regulatory mechanism to maintain I-Na at some minimal threshold value.}},

   health professionals. However, patients too may be able to signal the
   occurrence of undesirable events.
   OBJECTIVE: To estimate the frequency of undesirable events reported by
   recently discharged patients, and to identify correlates of undesirable
   events.
   DESIGN: Mailed patient survey.
   SETTING: Swiss public teaching hospital.
   PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients (N=1,518) discharged from hospital.
   MEASUREMENTS: Self-reports of 27 undesirable events during
   hospitalization, including 9 medical complications, 9 interpersonal
   problems, and 9 incidents related to the health care process.
   RESULTS: Most survey respondents (1,433, 94.4\%) completed the section
   about undesirable events, and 725 (50.6\%) reported at least 1 event.
   The most frequent events were phlebitis (11.0\%), unavailable medical
   record (9.5\%), failure to respect confidentiality (8.4\%), and
   hospital-acquired infection (8.2\%). The odds of an unfavorable rating
   increased with each additional interpersonal problem (odds ratio {[}OR]
   1.6, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 1.3 to 1.8), each additional
   process-related problem (OR 1.5, 95\% CI 1.3 to 1.9), but not with each
   additional medical complication (OR 1.0, 95\% CI 0.9 to 1.2). Longer
   duration of stay, poor health, and depressed mood were all related to a
   greater reported frequency of undesirable events.
   CONCLUSION: Patients are able to report undesirable events that occur
   during hospital care. Such events occur in about a half of the
   hospitalizations, and have a negative impact on satisfaction with care.}},

   Isolate P25, identified as the Gram-positive rod-shaped organism
   Rhodococcus erythropolis, had the highest growth and degradation rate at
   15 degrees C. It could remove 26.0\% of 100 mg l(-1) phenanthrene in 20
   days at 15 degrees C, and degradation was less at 5 degrees C and 25
   degrees C. The addition of surfactants to enhance degradation was
   tested. Brij 30 and Triton X-100 inhibited degradation at all surfactant
   concentrations tested, but Tween 80 stimulated phenanthrene degradation,
   especially at low concentrations. When 20x CMC (critical micelle
   concentration) of Tween 80 was added, 38.0\% of 100 mg l(-1)

Abstract = {{The adsorption behavior of imidazoline amide as a cationic inhibitor for
   inhibiting galvanic corrosion has been investigated by using
   electrochemical methods and atomic force microscopy(AFM) technology. The
   results show that the adsorption behavior of the inhibitor is
   significantly affected by the excess charge on the metal surface. Carbon
   steel and stainless steel carry negative and positive excess charges
   when they are immersed in 1\% NaCl solution, respectively. The inhibitor
   adsorbs on the surface of carbon steel, while it does not adsorb on the
   surface of stainless steel in aqueous NaCl solution. When the two metals
   are electrically coupled in NaCI solution, positive and negative excess
   charges are carried on the carbon steel and the stainless steel,
   respectively. The inhibitor can adsorb on the surfaces of both carbon
   steel and stainless steel. However, in this case, the surface coverage
   of the inhibitor film formed on the carbon steel decreases compared with
   that on the surface of single carbon steel, and the adsorbability of the

Abstract = {{Purpose: To determine the anti-tumor activity DX-8951f when administered
   as a 30-minute infusion daily for 5 days every 3 weeks to patients with
   previously untreated metastatic gastric cancer, and to evaluate
   toxicities and pharmacokinetics (PK) of DX-8951f in this patient
   population. Patients and methods: Forty-one patients were enrolled. All
   had previously untreated metastatic gastric cancer. DX-8951f was
   administered until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
   Responses were assessed after every 2 courses using RECIST criteria.
   Results: Thirty-nine patients were evaluable. Two patients achieved a
   partial response (PR) and 18 achieved stable disease (SD), including
   five patients with unconfirmed PR. A total of 141 courses of therapy
   were delivered (median 3, range 1-10). The most common drug-related
   toxicity was neutropenia. Non-hematologic toxicities were mostly mild to
   moderate; the most common were nausea, vomiting and anorexia. Plasma
   concentrations of DX-8951 (the anhydrous form of DX-8951f) were well
   described using a linear 2-compartment PK model. All concentrations and
   dose events were simultaneously modeled and explained by the population
   PK model. There was no evidence of non-linearity in the elimination PK,
   auto-inhibition or induction of DX-8951 clearance over the five days of
   administration. Conclusions: DX-8951f had modest activity against
   metastatic gastric cancer and its PK was dose-proportional. The toxicity
   profile was predictable and manageable. Further development of this
   agent is warranted.}},

Volume = {{97}},

Abstract = {{This study was designed i) to investigate the role of histamine
   H-3-receptor ligands on mouse modified forced swimming test, a method
   that distinguishes the catecholaminergic behaviour with that of
   serotonergic compounds and ii) to evaluate the role of free radicals in
   mediation of such effects. Swiss strain albino mice were treated with
   different doses of histamine H-3-receptor antagonist thioperamide (3.75,
   7.5 and 15 mg/kg intraperitoneally) and agonist
   (R)-alpha-methylhistamine (5 mu g intracerebroventricularly). The
   climbing, swimming and immobility times were recorded for 6 min.
   Immediately after modified forced swimming test, the animals were
   sacrificed and parameters of oxidative stress were assessed in the brain
   by measuring the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS),
   glutathione (GSH) and catalase levels. Thioperamide (7.5 and 15 mg/kg
   intraperitoneally) dose-dependently decreased immobility time and
   increased swimming time but not climbing time. The behaviour of mice
   treated with (R)-alpha-methylhistamine was similar to that of control
   mice. A significant reduction in GSH and an increase in catalase levels
   were observed in brains of mice exposed to modified forced swimming
   test. Thioperamide pretreatment dose-dependently reversed such an
   alteration in oxidative stress parameters. (R)-alpha-methylhistamine
   caused a reversal of altered catalase but not GSH levels. Thioperamide
   shows antidepressant effects in the modified forced swimming test and
   causes a reversal of the test-induced oxidative stress indicating its
   antioxidant potential. The antidepressant effect of thioperamide appears
   to be mediated via serotonergic and/or antioxidant mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Transgenic crops can interbreed with other crop cultivars or with
   related weeds, increasing the potential of the hybrid progeny for
   competition. To prevent generating competitive hybrids, we previously
   tested tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) as a model for validating the
   transgenic mitigation (TM) concept using tandem constructs where a gene
   of choice is linked to mitigating genes that are positive or neutral to
   the crop, but deleterious to a recipient under competition. Here, we
   examine the efficacy of the TM concept at various ratios of
   transgenically mitigated tobacco in competition with the wild type
   tobacco in an ecological replacement series. The
   dwarf/herbicide-resistant TM transgenic plants cultivated alone under
   self-competition grew well and formed many more flowers than the tall
   wild type, which is an indication of greater reproductivity. In contrast
   to the wild type, TM flowering was almost completely suppressed in mixed
   cultures at most TM/wild type ratios up to 75\% transgenic, as the TM
   plants were extremely unfit to reproduce. In addition, homozygous TM
   progeny had an even lower competitive fitness against the wild type than
   hemizygous/homozygous TM segregants. Thus, the TM technology was
   effective in reducing the risk of transgene establishment of
   intraspecific transgenic hybrids at different competitive levels, at the
   close spacing typical of weed populations.}},

Abstract = {{Maximising the performance of parallel systems requires matching
   message-passing algorithms and application characteristics with a
   suitable underling interconnection network. Broadcast algorithms for
   wormhole-switched meshes have been widely reported in the literature.
   However, most of these algorithms handle broadcast in a sequential
   manner and do not scale well with the network size. As a consequence,
   many parallel applications cannot be efficiently supported using
   existing techniques. Motivated by these observations, this paper
   presents a new efficient broadcast algorithm for the mesh, called the
   Plane-Based (PB) algorithm. The main feature of this approach is its
   ability to perform broadcast operation with a high degree of scalability
   and parallelism. Furthermore, performance is insensitive to the network
   size, i.e., only three message-passing steps are required to implement a
   broadcast operation irrespective of the network size. Results from a
   comparative analysis demonstrate that the PB algorithm exhibits superior
   performance characteristics over those of the well-known Recursive
   Doubling and Extending Dominating Node algorithms. (c) 2005 Elsevier

   two methods of active identification are compared-the instrumental

   relation between these methods is established in the situation where the
   measurable input is represented by a test signal in the form of the sum
   of harmonics, whose number is equal to the state space dimension of the
   plant. The advantages of the finite-frequency method are twofold: it
   reduces both the sensitivity of the estimates of the plant coefficients
   to the errors in experimental data and the effect of the dependence
   between the measurable input and exogenous disturbance on the accuracy
   of identification. These extra capabilities are provided by the
   self-tuning of the frequencies of the test signal.}},

Abstract = {{Context.-Graft vascular disease remains a significant source of
   morbidity and mortality in heart transplant patients. The influence of
   acute cellular rejection on the development of graft vascular disease is
   controversial.
   Objective.-To determine the relationship between mean acute cellular
   rejection score and the presence of atherosclerosis or fibrointimal
   hyperplasia in cardiac allografts at autopsy.
   Design.-This retrospective, autopsy-based study examined 27 heart
   transplant patients to evaluate for graft vascular disease. A rejection
   score for each patient was calculated as the average of all the
   rejection scores determined by endomyocardial biopsy. Gross and
   histologic examination of the heart was used to divide patients into 3
   groups: no coronary artery disease, atherosclerosis, and fibrointimal
   hyperplasia. Mean rejection scores were calculated for each of these
   groups for all patients and patients who survived longer than 3 months.
   Mean rejection scores were compared by an analysis of variance and
   pair-wise t tests.
   Results.-Mean rejection scores demonstrated a trend of increasing value
   from no coronary disease (0.323) to atherosclerosis (0.569) to
   fibrointimal hyperplasia (0.835). Only fibrointimal hyperplasia had a
   significantly higher mean rejection score compared with patients with no
   coronary disease when examined in all patients (P = .01) and in patients
   who survived longer than 3 months (P = .049).
   Conclusion.-This study showed that the development of coronary artery
   fibrointimal hyperplasia, but not atherosclerosis, was significantly
   related to mean acute rejection score.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN UROLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{566-571}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate in prostate needle biopsies the usefulness and
   the efficacy of not time-consuming morphologic parameters in order to
   predict whether prostate cancer is organ-confined or it is not, that
   could contribute additional information to pre-surgical serum PSA and
   Gleason score, both of them parameters already accepted as clinically
   significant.
   Methods: Three hundred and two consecutive patients were evaluated, of
   whom a diagnostic needle biopsy and the radical prostatectomy specimen
   with no pre-surgical hormone therapy were available. Bilateral or
   unilateral extension, number of positive cores, percentage of positive
   cores, intraprostatic perineural invasion (IPNI) and the presence of
   high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN) in any of the
   biopsy cores were evaluated in the needle biopsy.
   Results: The median of cores is 6. The IPNI, the presence of bilateral
   tumour, and the percentage of positive cores, higher than 37.5\% (ROC
   curve), show significant crude OR (4.0, 2.8, 6.9 respectively). The
   regression model discloses that only the percentage of positive cores
   shows a significant OR (5.8) adjusting for bilaterality, IPNI, HGPIN and
   age.
   Conclusions: The percentage of cores with cancer and the bilateral
   involvement are another two parameters predictive of cancer with
   extraprostatic extension. (p < 0.0005 in both). IPNI has statistical
   significance too (p < 0.002), but it is related to the tumour volume
   expressed through the two mentioned parameters. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Aspergillus oryzae mutant strain UV-7 was further improved for the
   production Of Ill from L-tyrosine using chemical mutation. Different
   putative mutant strains of the organism were tested for the production
   of L-dopa in triplicate shake-flask cultures. Among these putative
   mutants, the strain designated SI-12 gave a maximal production of L-dopa
   (444 +/- 14 mg of L-dopa/g of cells). The regulation Of L-dopa from
   different carbon source solutions {[}initial substrate concentration
   (S-0) = 30 g/l] by the mutant culture was investigated. At an initial pH
   (pH(0)) of 5.0 and a temperature (T) of 30 degrees C, 100 \% of sugars
   were utilized for product and cell mass formation, corresponding to
   final L-dopa product yield of 189 +/- 8 mg/g of substrate utilized and
   maximum volumetric and specific productivities of 145 +/- 5 mg/h per
   litre and 155 +/- 8 mg/h per g of cells respectively. There was up to
   3-fold enhancement in product formation rate. This enhancement is, to
   our knowledge, the highest reported in the literature. To explain the
   kinetic mechanism Of Ill formation and its thermal inactivation, the
   thermodynamic parameters were determined with the application of the
   Arrhenius model. Activation enthalpy and entropy for product formation,
   in the case of the mutant derivative, were 40 kJ/mol and 0.076 kJ (.)
   mol(-1) (.) K-1 for its production and 116 kJ/mol and 0.590 kJ (.)
   mol(-1) (.) K-1 for thermal inactivation respectively. The respective
   values for product formation and product de-activation were lower than
   the respective values for the parental culture. Therefore the mutant
   strain was thermodynamically more resistant to thermal denaturation
   during the product-formation process.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To develop a bovine protocol for training in preimplantation
   genetic diagnosis (PGD) using PCR.
   Design: Randomized study.
   Setting: Human reproduction PCR laboratory.
   Patient(s): Cow ovaries obtained from slaughterhouses.
   Intervention(s): The ovaries were punctured and the oocytes were matured
   and submitted to in vitro fertilization. On the third day after
   fertilization, the embryos were biopsied and 1-2 blastomeres removed. A
   blastomere and the rest of the embryo were submitted to PCR for sex
   determination.
   Main Outcome Measure(S): Establishment of a possible training protocol.
   Result(s): A total of 50 embryos and 50 biopsied blastomeres were
   submitted to DNA amplification for sexing. Of the 50 embryos, 41 (82\%)
   achieved successful DNA amplification and 9 (18\%) did not. Of the 50
   biopsies, 31 (62\%) amplified and 19 (38\%) did not. In 27 (65.9\%) of
   the 41 embryos with DNA amplification, sex was identified as female and
   in 14 (34.1\%) as male. In 40 cases (80\%) amplification and sex
   determination were in both embryos and blastomeres. Sex was identical in
   all these cases.
   Conclusion(s): This training model seems to be useful in identifying
   mistakes and difficulties and improving the professional's performance
   in the various stages of preimplantation genetic diagnosis.}},

Title = {{High thoracic epidural anesthesia and coronary artery disease in
   surgical and non-surgical patients}},
Journal = {{CURRENT OPINION IN ANESTHESIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{501-506}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose of review
   Even though high thoracic epidural anesthesia has been shown to be
   highly efficacious in the control of symptoms in refractory angina, its
   general use is still restricted. In patients who undergo coronary
   revascularization, however, the technique is becoming more and more
   popular. The present review outlines the use of high thoracic epidural
   anesthesia in patients with ischemic heart disease who underwent
   coronary revascularization in order to further reveal high thoracic
   epidural anesthesia's low complication rate and to analyze why
   physicians still refrain from using it more frequently.
   Recent findings
   The incidence of severe hemodynamic complications after high thoracic
   epidural anesthesia is low in patients with coronary artery disease. The
   main advantage would be a myocardial sympathectomy leading to an
   improvement in the oxygen input-demand relationship. Likewise, a
   decrease in mortality due to respiratory complications could not be
   shown. In patients undergoing myocardial revascularization with full
   anticoagulation there is an increased risk of epidural hematoma
   formation. Its precise risk is difficult to evaluate. There is an
   overall low rate of epidural hematomas as a result of high thoracic
   epidural anesthesia. With the available data, the incidence has been
   estimated at between 1/1500 and 1/10 000.
   Summary
   Epidural anesthesia does not decrease mortality or the incidence of
   myocardial infarction after coronary artery bypass grafting. It reduces
   the incidence of arrhythmias and respiratory complications and improves
   the quality of analgesia. High thoracic epidural anesthesia has been
   shown to be a safe and efficient technique for refractory angina that
   reduces the frequency of ischemic events and improves the clinical
   condition of patients.}},

Abstract = {{Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is considered to be one of the most
   effective treatments for superficial and in situ bladder cancer.
   However, either failure to respond initially or relapse within the first
   5 years of treatment has been observed in some patients. As nitric oxide
   (NO) has been detected in the bladder of BCG-treated patients, we
   analyzed the role of endogenous NO generated after BCG treatments on
   human (T24) and murine (MB49 and MBT2) bladder tumor cells in the
   viability of tumor and immune cells, both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro
   inhibition of cancer cells after BCG treatment was evaluated by cell
   titer assay. NO production was determined as nitrite by Griess reagent.
   The death of immunocytes was evaluated by Cr-51 release. Tumor histology
   with hematoxylin and eosin and Masson ` s trichrome staining was
   performed. BCG induced a direct inhibition of tumor cell growth in
   vitro, independently of NO levels. Besides, BCG-mediated NO production
   by tumor cells induced the death of spleen and peritoneal cells in
   syngeneic mice. The in vivo inhibition of NO synthase (NOS) activity by
   N-G-nitro-Larginine methyl ester in combination with BCG, improved tumor
   regression by generating a healing tissue. The increase of NO generated
   after BCG administration may induce the death of immunocytes. The in
   vivo inhibition of NO ameliorated immunotherapy with BCG by additional
   tumor growth inhibition. Our results suggested the possibility that the
   final outcome of patients with bladder tumors may improve by modulating
   NOS activity concomitantly with BCG therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. To determine the variables that affect the cure rate in
   patients with urge incontinence treated with sacral neuromodulation.
   Methods. This prospective analysis of patients with refractory urinary
   urge incontinence who underwent placement of a neuromodulator lead and
   generator was undertaken between October 2000 and December 2003.
   Quantitative assessment of the severity of their urinary leakage was
   assessed by preoperative and postoperative 3-day bladder diaries
   documenting leakage episodes, number of pads used per day, and a 24-hour
   pad weight assessment. Cure was defined as no daily leakage episodes
   after permanent implantation. Subjective outcome was assessed using the
   Incontinence Impact Questionnaire. Two-sample independent t tests,
   two-way chi-square tests, and tests of two proportions were performed
   when appropriate, with P <0.05 considered significant.
   Results. The mean postimplantation follow-up was 29 months, and the
   average age was 60 years (range 29 to 83). The cure rate was associated
   with age, with individuals younger than 55 years having a statistically
   significant greater cure rate (65\% versus 37\% for older individuals; P
   <0.05). Having three or more chronic conditions was associated with a
   lower cure rate in both younger and older individuals. Patients with a
   neurologic condition also had a lower cure rate, but no specific
   neurologic condition was associated.
   Conclusions. Age older than 55 years and more than three chronic
   conditions were independent factors associated with a lower cure rate in
   patients implanted with a sacral neuromodulator for refractory urge
   incontinence. A neurologic condition may be associated with a decrease
   in the cure rate.}},

Abstract = {{The scaling capability of germanium-on-insulator (GOI) and

   show that GOI devices can provide higher drive current than SOI at the
   same off-state leakage current. Thin-body GOI devices have the
   advantages of thin-body structures and the off-state leakage current of
   GOI is comparable with SOI, even lower than SOI. Furthermore, GOI can
   greatly relax the stringent requirement of the body thickness by similar
   to 127\% and similar to 84\% for low operating power (LOP) and
   high-performance logic (HP) applications, respectively, for 50 nn gate
   length, and similar to 180\% and similar to 130\% for 20 nm gate length,
   respectively. The results indicate that GOI is superior to SOI and shows
   strong scaling capability for both HP and LOP applications. However,
   compared with SOI, the intrinsic delay of GOI is comparable with SOI due
   to the large gate capacitance. GOI does not show greater advantages over

Abstract = {{Seasonal fluxes of CO2 from soil and the contribution of autotrophic
   (root + mycorrhizal) to total soil respiration (SR) were estimated for a
   mixed stand of European beech (Fagus sylvatica) and Norway spruce (Picea
   abies) in Central Europe. Mature trees of each species were girdled in
   August 2002 to eliminate carbohydrate allocation to roots. SR was
   measured at distances of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5/2.0 m from the bole of each
   tree at 1-2 weeks intervals throughout the fall of 2002 and monthly
   during the spring and summer of 2003. The contribution of roots and
   mycorrhizae to total SR was estimated by the decrease in SR compared to
   ungirdled control trees to account for seasonal patterns evident in
   controls. SR decreased with soil temperature in the fall 2002 and
   increased again in 2003 as soil warmed. During most of the study period,
   SR was strongly related to soil temperature. During the dry summer of
   2003, however, SR appeared to be uncoupled from temperature and was
   strongly related to soil water content (SWC). Mean rates of SR in beech
   and spruce control plots as well as root densities did not show a clear
   pattern with distance from the bole. SR decreased to levels below
   controls in beech within a few days after girdling, whereas spruce did
   not show a significant decrease until October 2002, 6 weeks after
   girdling. In both beech and spruce, decreased SR in response to girdling
   was greatest closest to the bole, possibly reflecting increased
   mycorrhizal activity close to the bole. Autotrophic respiration was
   estimated in beech to be as much as 50\% of the total SR in the stand.
   The contribution of autotrophic respiration was less certain for spruce,
   although close to the bole, the autotrophic fraction may contribute to
   total SR as much as in beech. The large fraction of autotrophic
   respiration in total SR requires better understanding of tree level
   stresses that affect carbon allocation below ground.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims Petunia inflata has been treated taxonomically in
   various ways: it has been described as an independent species, treated
   as a synonym of P. integrifolia, and also regarded as a subspecies of P.
   integrifolia. The present study was designed to resolve the ambiguity
   involving the P. integrifolia complex (P. integrifolia plus P. inflata).
   Methods Tentative identification (either integrifolia group or inflata
   group) was carried out in the field based on the observation of live
   specimens at the restricted type localities. The accuracy of the
   tentative identification was later tested with principal component and
   cluster analyses of data obtained by measuring 21 morphological
   characters on cultivated live specimens sourced from 113 natural
   populations of the P. integrifolia complex in Argentina, Brazil,
   Paraguay and Uruguay.
   Key Results There was a clear, statistically significant gap between the
   morphological measurements of the two groups, ensuring the accuracy of
   identification carried out in the field except for a probable hybrid
   swarm. Previously, the condition of the pedicel in the fruiting state
   was considered an important character distinguishing between these two
   groups; however, the condition of the pedicel was rather variable in the
   integrifolia group. The two groups were found to have geographically
   distinct distributions: the integrifolia group occurred in southern
   regions, whereas the inflata group occurred in northern regions.
   Conclusions Based on the available evidence, it is suggested that the
   two groups are allopatric species, P. integrifolia and P. inflata, in
   agreement with the opinion of Fries (1911).}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the effect of Rosiglitazone in three patients
   treated with bilateral adrenalectomy followed by hyperpigmentation and
   hypersecretion of ACTH.
   Patients and methods: One patient had increasing ACTH after previous
   transsphenoidal surgery for Nelson's syndrome, and two patients without
   pituitary adenomas had recurrence of Cushing's disease after primary and
   repeated transsphenoidal surgery with need for bilateral adrenalectomy.
   The patients developed hyperpigmentation and increasing ACTH at nadir 2
   -4 h after morning hydrocortisone dose. ACTH during Rosiglitazone
   therapy (4 mg/day for 4 weeks and then 8 mg/day) was measured at regular
   intervals 24 It after the latest dose of hydrocortisone.
   Results: In two patients there was a decrease in ACTH by 40\% after 5
   months. The first of these patients showed an escape with increasing
   ACTH to the initial value after 11 months. In the third patient no
   effect was observed. Tumour development or progression on magnetic
   resonance imaging was not observed.
   Conclusion: Rosiglitazone might represent an adjuvant therapy in
   patients with ACTH hypersecretion. Larger long-term studies are needed.}},

Abstract = {{We present a sensitive, multiwavelength submillimeter continuum survey
   of 153 young stellar objects in the Taurus-Auriga star formation region.
   The submillimeter detection rate is 61\% to a completeness limit of
   similar to 10 mJy (3 sigma) at 850 mu m. The inferred circumstellar disk
   masses are lognormally distributed with a mean mass of similar to 5 x
   10(-3) M-circle dot and a large dispersion (0.5 dex). Roughly one-third
   of the submillimeter sources have disk masses larger than the minimal
   nebula from which the solar system formed. The median disk-to-star mass
   ratio is 0.5\%. The empirical behavior of the submillimeter continuum is
   best described as F-nu proportional to nu(2.0 +/- 0.5) between 350 mu m
   and 1.3 mm, which we argue is due to the combined effects of the
   fraction of optically thick emission and a flatter frequency behavior of
   the opacity compared to the interstellar medium. The latter effect could
   be due to a substantial population of large dust grains, which
   presumably would have grown through collisional agglomeration. In this
   sample, the only stellar property that is correlated with the outer disk
   is the presence of a companion. We find evidence for significant
   decreases in submillimeter flux densities, disk masses, and
   submillimeter continuum slopes along the canonical infrared spectral
   energy distribution evolution sequence for young stellar objects. The
   fraction of objects detected in the submillimeter is essentially
   identical to the fraction with excess near-infrared emission, suggesting
   that dust in the inner and outer disks is removed nearly simultaneously.}},

Abstract = {{Juzen-taiho-to (JTX), one of the commonly prescribed traditional
   Japanese herbal medicines (Kampo), is indicated for adjunctive treatment
   of cancers and autoimmune diseases. To understand the mechanisms
   underlying the clinical effects of JTX, the effects of orally
   administered JTX on the expression of metallothioneins (MTs) were
   examined in the liver, spleen, small and large intestines of mice. In
   addition, the expression of MTs in specific pathogen free (SPF) mice was
   examined to understand the participation of intestinal bacteria in the
   expression of MTs. JTX enhanced expression of MT-I and -II significantly
   in the liver of SPF mice. Induction of MT-II expression was observed
   also in the small intestine. Intestinal bacteria appeared to have no
   effect on MTs expression. Neither expression of MT-III nor its induction
   was observed in any tissue. These findings strongly suggest that MTs
   should mediate at least some effects of JTX in mice. Copyright (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Inflammatory sarcomatoid carcinoma is an aggressive tumor with an
   unusually benign appearance. We report the case of a 65-year-old man
   with a history of inoperable poorly differentiated carcinoma of the
   right lung, for which he had received chemoradiotherapy. A new solitary
   mass was discovered 4 years later in the left lung on surveillance
   computed tomography. The patient underwent thoracotomy with a wedge
   biopsy on which frozen section was performed. The nodule was vaguely
   granulomatous and associated with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate and a
   deceptively bland spindle cell proliferation. Results of
   immuno-peroxidase studies, however, showed that the nodule contained
   neoplastic cells with an epithelial phenotype that were invading the
   pulmonary vessels. These are features of the rare inflammatory
   sarcomatoid carcinoma. In contrast to sarcomatoid carcinomas, this case
   highlights the deceptively benign appearance of inflammatory sarcomatoid
   carcinoma. This leads us to concur with the recommendation to exercise
   caution when attempting the diagnosis of apparently benign lesions on
   intraoperative frozen section in patients with high clinical suspicion
   of malignancy.}},

Abstract = {{We present two familial cases of complement factor 2 (C2) type I
   deficiency. Probands had experienced severe pyogenic bacteria infections
   in childhood and had undetectable levels of C2 and very low level of
   CH50. Both children were homozygous for the deletion of 28 bp in exon 6
   of the C2 gene. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing in family I had the
   commonly reported associations, but family 2 demonstrated a new
   association of the mutated C2 gene to HLA-A{*}3101, -Cw{*}0602,
   -B{*}1801, and -DRB1{*}0901. In addition, for the first time, the
   frequency of the 28-bp deletion of C2 and its HLA haplotypic
   associations have been analyzed in a sample of the Spanish population
   containing 790 haplotypes and 105 phenotypes. Cw{*}0602 is frequently
   found in Spanish haplotypes linked to the C2 Mutated gene instead of the
   commonly reported -Cw{*}1203. The presence of heterozygous or homozygous
   individuals for the C2 deletion with low levels of IgD in both families
   Supports the existence of a putative dominant susceptibility gene for
   IgD deficiency in haplotype HLA-B18, -S042, and -DR2. The frequency of
   the C2 28-bp deletion in heterozygosis is 1.4\% (gene frequency 0.007)

Journal = {{PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{182}},

Abstract = {{Rationale: Heroin is rapidly metabolized to morphine that in turn is
   transformed in morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G), an inactive metabolite, and
   morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G), a potent mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist.
   We have found that heroin addicts exhibit higher M6G/M3G ratios relative
   to morphine-treated control subjects. We have also shown that
   heroin-treated rats exhibit measurable levels of M6G (which is usually
   undetectable in this species) and reduced levels of M3G. Objective: We
   investigated the role of MOR in these effects of heroin, by examining
   the effects of methadone, a MOR agonist, and of naltrexone, a MOR
   antagonist, on morphine glucuronidation. We also investigated the
   effects of alcohol, which is known to alter drug metabolism and is
   frequently coabused by heroin addicts. Methods: Morphine glucuronidation
   was studied in liver microsomes obtained from rats exposed daily for 10
   days to saline, heroin (10 mg/kg, i.p.), naltrexone (20-40 mg/kg, i.p.),
   heroin + naltrexone (10 mg/kg + 20-40 mg/kg, i.p.), methadone (5-20
   mg/kg, i.p.), or 10\% ethanol. Results: Heroin induced the synthesis of
   M6G and decreased the synthesis of M3G. Naltrexone exhibited intrinsic
   modulatory activity on morphine glucuronidation, increasing the
   synthesis of M3G via a low-affinity/ high-capacity reaction
   characterized by positive cooperativity. The rate of M3G synthesis in
   the heroin + naltrexone groups was not different from that of the
   naltrexone groups. Methadone and ethanol induced a modest increase in
   M3G synthesis and had no effect on M6G synthesis. Conclusion: The
   effects of heroin on morphine glucuronidation are not shared by
   methadone or alcohol (two drugs that figure prominently in the natural
   history of heroin addiction) and do not appear to depend on the
   activation of MOR.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE - Among Europeans, mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear
   factor-alpha (HNF1 alpha) gene are associated with the most common form
   of maturity-ons,et diabetes of the young (M ODY)3. In Asian Indians,
   type 2 diabetes occurs earlier and often overlaps with MODY, but the
   genetics of the latter are unknown. The aim of this study was to
   estimate the prevalence of Ala98Val polymorphism of the HNF1 alpha gene
   in different types of diabetes in Asian Indians.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Genotyping of Ala98Val was done by the
   PCR-restriction fragment-length polymorphism method in the following
   groups: 1) MODY, defined as non-insulin-dependent diabetes (age at onset
   < 25 years) and vertical transmission of diabetes thr, ough at least
   three generations (n - 122); 2) very-early-onset type 2 diabetes (age at
   onset < 25 years) without family history (n = 23); 3) early-onset type 2
   diabetes (age at onset between 26 and 40 years, n = 171); 4) late-onset
   type 2 diabetes (age at onset > 40 years, n 133); 5) type 1 diabetes (n
   = 150); and 6) normal glucose tolerance (n = 130). The frequency of the
   Val genotypes was compared in the diabetic and control groups.
   RESULTS - The frequency of the Val allele was significantly higher in
   MODY patients (P = 0.00 13) compared with control groups. Furthermore,
   in the total group of patients with type 2-like diabetes (groups 1-4),
   the Val allele was associated with an earlier diagnosis of diabetes (P =
   0.0002).
   CONCLUSIONS - Among Asian Indians, the Ala98Val polymorphism of HNF1
   alpha gene is associated with MODY and with earlier age at onset of type
   2 diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To analyze clinical, laboratory and treatment features
   associated with death in a childhood-onset SLE population. Patients and
   methods: Patients with childhood-onset SLE followed at the State
   University of Campinas, Brazil, between 1980 and 2002 were included.
   Data on clinical and laboratory features of the disease were collected
   regularly. Logistic regression was used for analyzing association
   between clinical and laboratory features and death. Kaplan-Meyer tests
   were used to estimate the survival curves. Results: Of 61 patients
   identified, six were lost to follow-up during the first year of disease.
   The mean follow-up period of the remaining 55 patients was 3.25 years
   (SD=1.2). Mean SLICC/ACR-DI score was 4.9 (SD=3.4). Death occurred in 12
   (21.8\%) of 55 patients. Direct causes of death were: infection in six
   (50\%), stroke in four (33.3\%), and renal insufficiency in two
   (16.7\%). Five patients (41.7\%) died during the first 5 years of
   disease due to infection. Male gender (p=0.004; OR=9.1; 95\%
   CI=7.6-21.0), infection (p=0.001; OR=4.2; 95\% CI=1.6-15.2) and
   nephritis (p=0.02; OR=2.3; 95\% CI=1.3-5.2) were independent factors
   associated with death in the multivariate analysis. The global survival
   rate adjusted for duration of disease was 93.9\% in the first year of
   disease, 88.9\% in the second year, 80.8\% in the fifth year and 48.1\%
   in 20 years of follow-up. When comparing survival curves, male gender,
   the presence of infection during the course of the disease and the
   presence of nephritis during follow-up had a worse survival. Conclusion:
   Male gender, the presence of infection and nephritis were independent
   risk factors for death in our Brazilian cohort. Damage did not
   independently influence survival in this study.}},

Abstract = {{Inspired by the locomotion mechanism of sea urchins, we study the
   locomotion of an irregular echinoid by means of a simplified dynamical
   model. We prove that if two conjectures are assumed, the geometrical
   arrangement of the five ambulacral petals of irregular echinoids should
   form a eutactic star in order to optimize motility. We firstly propose
   an adequate ``measure{''} of eutacticity that allows us to to verify the
   statistical tendency to such a property for a representative collection
   of fossil specimens. Next, regarding dynamics, the biological advantage
   of eutactic stars is addressed as a minimal path problem. Finally, we
   study the stability of some eutactic stars under small perturbations.}},

Abstract = {{Background. We evaluated the efficacy of emergency balloon-occluded
   retrograde transvenous obliteration (B-RTO) performed within 24 h after
   initial hemostasis for the prevention of rebleeding from ruptured
   gastric varices. Methods. From December 1995 to March 2003, 11 patients
   who had undergone B-RTO within 24 h after the control of gastric
   variceal bleeding at Maebashi Red Cross Hospital were investigated. They
   were followed up for complete eradication, recurrence of varices, and
   rebleeding. Efficacy was determined by endoscopic examination and
   computed tomography. Results. The 4 patients with acute bleeding from
   ruptured gastric varices were treated with endoscopic therapy endoscopic
   variceal ligation (EVL) in 2 patients, and clipping treatment in 2.
   Initial hemostasis was achieved in all 4; the other 7 patients had
   already stopped bleeding at endoscopy. After hemostasis was achieved,
   emergency B-RTO was immediately performed within 24 h and was successful
   in all 11 patients. Ten ( 90.9\%) of the 11 gastric varices were
   obliterated and the other 1 (9.1\%) was diminished in size. During the
   mean follow-up period of 1136 days, no rebleeding or recurrence as
   found. Four patients died during the follow-up period, but none died
   from variceal bleeding. Survival rates were 90.9\% and 70.7\%,
   respectively, at 1 year and 3 years. In 6 patients, development of
   esophageal varices appeared during the follow-up period, all of which
   were controlled by usual endoscopic therapy. No severe side effects were
   found after the B-RTO treatment. Conclusions. Emergency B-RTO is an
   effective treatment for the prevention of rebleeding from ruptured
   gastric varices.}},

Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{379-387}},

Abstract = {{We performed a proteome-wide survey of the domain architectures in
   single-spanning transmembrane (TM) proteins (single-spannings) from 87
   sequenced prokaryotic (Bacterial and Archaean) genomes by assigning Pfam
   domains to their N-tail and C-tail loops. Out of 14,625
   single-spannings, 3516 sequences have at least one domain assigned, and
   no domains were assigned to 7850, with the remaining 3259 with less
   reliable assignment. In the domain-assigned sequences, 3116 sequences
   are with at most two domains, and the other 400 sequences with more than
   two. The assigned domains distribute over 651 Pfam families, which
   account for 11.4\% of the total Pfam-A families. Among the 651 families
   are mostly soluble-protein-originated ones, but only 21 families are
   unique to TM proteins. The occurrence frequency of the individual domain
   families follows a power-law, that is, 264 families occur only once, 106
   just twice, and the families appeared more than 30 times are counted by
   only 39. It is found that the great majority of the sequences having one
   or two domains are of the type 11 topology with the C-tail loop
   containing domains on it. On the contrary, the N-tail loop of the same
   type topology seldom carries domains. Importantly, the assigned domains
   are always found on the tail loops longer than 60 residues, even for the
   small domains with less than 30 residues. There are still as many as
   5800 sequences without assigned domains in spite of having at least one
   long tail, on which no less than 1000 novel domain families are expected
   most likely to lie concealed unknown yet. We also investigated the
   domain arrangement preference and the domain family combination patterns
   in `singlets' (single-spannings with one assigned domain) and `doublets'
   (with two domains). (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Outbreaks of poliomyelitis caused by circulating vaccine-derived
   polioviruses (cVDPVs) have been reported in areas where indigenous wild
   polioviruses (PVs) were eliminated by vaccination. Most of these cVDPVS
   contained unidentified sequences in the nonstructural protein coding
   region which were considered to be derived from human enterovirus
   species C (HEV-C) by recombination. In this study, we report isolation
   of a Sabin 3-derived PV recombinant (Cambodia-02) from an acute flaccid
   paralysis (AFP) case in Cambodia in 2002. We attempted to identify the
   putative recombination counterpart of Cambodia-02 by sequence analysis
   of nonpolio enterovirus isolates from AFP cases in Cambodia from 1999 to
   2003. Based on the previously estimated evolution rates of PVs, the
   recombination event resulting in Cambodia-02 was estimated to have
   occurred within 6 months after the administration of oral PV vaccine
   (99.3\% nucleotide identity in VP1 region). The 2BC and the 3D(pol)
   coding regions of Cambodia-02 were grouped into the genetic cluster of
   indigenous coxsackie A virus type 17 (CAV17) (the highest {[}87.1\%]
   nucleotide identity) and the cluster of indigenous CAV13-CAV18 (the
   highest {[}94.9\%] nucleotide identity) by the phylogenic analysis of
   the HEV-C isolates in 2002, respectively. CAV13-CAV18 and CAV17 were the
   dominant HEV-C serotypes in 2002 but not in 2001 and in 2003. We found a
   putative recombination between CAV13-CAV18 and CAV17 in the 3CD(pro)
   coding region of a CAV17 isolate. These results suggested that a part of
   the 3D(pro) coding region of PV3(Cambodia-02) was derived from a HEV-C
   strain genetically related to indigenous CAV13-CAV18 strains in 2002 in

Abstract = {{The SAT-based approach to the decision problem for expressive,
   decidable, quantifier-free first-order theories has been investigated
   with remarkable results at least since 1993. One such theory,
   successfully employed in the formal verification of complex, infinite
   state systems, is Separation Logic (SL), which combines Boolean logic
   with arithmetic constraints of the form x - y x c, where x is <=, <, >,
   >=, =, or not equal. The SAT-based approach to SL was first proposed and
   implemented in 1999: the results in terms of performance were good, and
   since then a number of other systems for SL have appeared. In this paper
   we focus on the problem of building efficient SAT-based decision
   procedures for SL. We present the basic procedure and four optimizations
   that improve dramatically its effectiveness in most cases: (a) IS (2)
   preprocessing, (b) early pruning, (c) model reduction, and (d) best
   reason detection. For each technique we give an example of how it might
   improve the performance. Furthermore, for the first three techniques, we
   give a pseudo-code representation and formally state the soundness and
   completeness of the resulting optimized procedure. We also show how it
   is possible to check the satisfiability of valuations involving
   constraints of the form x - y < c using the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
   Lastly, we present an extensive comparative experimental analysis,
   showing that our solver TSAT++, built along the lines described in this
   paper, is currently the state of the art on various classes of problems,
   including randomly generated, hand-made, and real-world instances.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The asymptotic scheme of post-Newtonian approximation defined for
   general relativity in the harmonic gauge by Futamase \& Schutz (1983) is
   based on a family of initial data for the matter fields of a perfect
   fluid and for the initial metric, defining a family of weakly
   self-gravitating systems. We show that Weinberg's (1972) expansion of
   the metric and his general expansion of the energy-momentum tensor T, as
   well as his expanded equations for the gravitational field and his
   general form of the expanded dynamical equations, apply naturally to
   this family. Then, following the asymptotic scheme, we derive the
   explicit form of the expansion of T for a perfect fluid, and the
   expanded fluid-dynamical equations. (These differ from those written by
   Weinberg.) By integrating these equations in the domain occupied by a
   body, we obtain a general form of the translational equations of motion
   for a 1PN perfect-fluid system in general relativity. To put them into a
   tractable form, we use an asymptotic framework for the separation
   parameter eta, by defining a family of well-separated 1PN systems. We
   calculate all terms in the equations of motion up to the order eta(3)
   included. To calculate the 1PN correction part, we assume that the
   Newtonian motion of each body is a rigid one, and that the family is
   quasispherical, in the sense that in all bodies the inertia tensor comes
   close to being spherical as eta -> 0. Apart from corrections that cancel
   for exact spherical symmetry, there is in the final equations of motion
   one additional term, as compared with the Lorentz-Droste
   (Einstein-Infeld-Hoffmann) acceleration. This term depends on the spin
   of the body and on its internal structure.}},

Abstract = {{The early F dwarf star `J37' in the open cluster NGC 6633 shows an
   unusual pattern of photospheric abundances, including an
   order-of-magnitude enhancement of lithium and iron-peak elements, but an
   under-abundance of carbon. As a consequence of its thin convection zone
   these anomalies have been attributed to either radiative diffusion or
   the accretion of hydrogen-depleted material. By comparing
   high-resolution Very Large Telescope/ UV-Visual Echelle Spectrograph
   spectra of J37 (and other F stars in NGC 6633) with syntheses of the Be
   II doublet region at 3131 angstrom, we establish that J37 also has a Be
   abundance {[}A(Be) = 3.0 +/- 0.5] that is at least 10 times the cosmic
   value. This contradicts radiative diffusion models that produce a Li
   over-abundance, as they also predict photospheric Be depletion. Instead,
   since Be is a highly refractory element, it supports the notion that J37
   is the first clear example of a star that has accreted volatile-depleted
   material with a composition similar to chondritic meteorites, although
   some diffusion may be necessary to explain the low C and O abundances.}},

   of the errors of all methods for a given problem characterized by fuzzy
   numbers in this case. We generalize the concept of central algorithms,
   which are always optimal error algorithms and in the crisp case are
   useful both in practice and in theory. In order to do this we define the
   centre of an L-fuzzy subset of a normed space. The introduced concepts
   allow us to describe optimal methods of approximation for linear
   problems using balanced fuzzy information. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Mini-implants and mini-screws are commonly used in orthodontics to
   provide extra anchorage. One potential insertion site is between the
   roots in the alveolar process, which results in a risk of damaging the
   roots of neighbouring teeth. In an animal-experimental study, 20
   mini-screws (bracket screw bone anchors, BSBAs) were inserted into the
   mandible of five beagle dogs. Each dog received two BSBAs in each lower
   quadrant, between the roots of the second and third, and third and
   fourth premolars. Sequential point labelling was performed every 6 weeks
   with vital stains, and apical X-rays were taken every 6 weeks.
   Radiographic examination demonstrated damage at three roots because of
   insertion of the BSBAs. Histological examination at these three roots
   demonstrated an almost complete repair of the periodontal structure
   (e.g. cementum, periodontal ligament and bone) in a period of 12 weeks,
   following removal of the screws.}},

Journal = {{NUTRITION}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1025-1035}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objective: We examined the effects of feeding non-digestible
   disaccharides, difructose anhydride III (DFAIII), maltitol, melibiose
   and, cellobiose, on calcium, magnesium, and iron absorption in
   comparison with fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS) in normal and
   ovariectomized rats.
   Methods: In experiment 1, six groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats were
   fed a control diet (100 g of cellulose/kg of diet), test diets
   containing 30 g of FOS, or the four non-digestible disaccharides in
   place of the cellulose in the control diet for 4 wk. In experiment 2,
   two groups of female Sprague-Dawley rats (sham or ovariectomized) were
   assigned to one of four subgroups and fed the control or test diet
   containing FOS, DFAIII, and melibiose for 5 wk. Feces and cecal contents
   were collected to evaluate mineral absorption and cecal fermentation.
   Results: In experiment 1, calcium absorption in all the disaccharides
   groups except the cellobiose group, magnesium absorption in all test
   diet groups, and iron absorption in the FOS, DFAIII, and melibiose
   groups were higher than those in the control group. In ovariectomized
   rats (experiment 2), calcium absorption in the DFAIII and melibiose
   groups, magnesium absorption in all test diet groups, and iron
   absorption in the DFAIII group alone were higher than those in the
   control group. Cecal organic acids were positively and pH was negatively
   correlated with the absorption of these minerals, although the effects
   varied.
   Conclusion: Non-digestible disaccharides increase calcium, magnesium,
   and iron absorption in normal and ovariectomized rats; however, the
   effects depend on the disaccharide tested, a fact that may be partly
   associated with the cecal fermentation of these disaccharides. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{An artificial neural network model that estimates wood thermal
   conductivity under a wide range of conditions of moisture content,
   temperature and apparent density was developed and tested with
   literature obtained experimental data. The optimal network was
   determined to consist of an input layer, three hidden layers, and one
   output layer following the feed forward network structure and more
   specifically the back-propagation algorithm. Each of the three hidden
   layers of the ANN consisted of eleven neurons. The Neural works software
   package was used for the determination of the network structure and
   architecture, and for the training and testing phase. The evaluation
   produced an R 2 value equal to 0.9994 and a RMS Error equal to 0.0123,
   thus proving that the developed ANN model is a reliable approach with
   powerful predictive capacity towards the estimation of thermal
   conductivity and it can be used by researchers under a wide range of
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Nasal obstruction is a frequent symptom of consultation in paediatric
   otorhinolaryngology. Usually, adenoid hypertrophy is the cause.
   Sometimes the examination reveals the presence of polyps in the nose.
   The antrochoanal polyp of Killian is particularly frequent in childhood.
   The obstruction is usually unilateral, but the posterior extension of a
   bulky polyp to the oropharynx can cause a major discomfort, sometimes a
   respiratory distress. We report the observation of a 10-year-old patient
   presenting a bulky polyp of Killian, visible in the oropharynx and then

Abstract = {{Atorvastatin reduces both plasma cholesterol and triglyceride
   concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes, but mechanisms
   underlying triglyceride decrease and the effect of atorvastatin on high
   density lipoprotein (HDL) still remain unclear. Apolipoprotein (apo) E
   plays a crucial role in modulating production and clearance of
   triglyceride-rich very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). The main effect
   of apoAI is to modulate HDL metabolism. The aim of this work was to
   study the influence of atorvastatin on apoAI and apoE kinetics and to
   determine whether its hypocholesterolemic and hypotriglyceridemic
   effects could be related to changes in this apolipoprotein metabolism.
   Plasma VLDL-apoE, HDL-apoE, and HDL-apoAI were studied in seven patients
   with diabetes with mixed hyperlipidemia using a stable isotope labeling
   technique ({[}H-2(3)]leucine-primed constant infusion) and
   monocompartmental model before and after 2 months of treatment with 40
   mg/day of atorvastatin. Plasma apoE concentration was significantly
   reduced (44.1 +/- 19.1 versus 32 +/- 11.6 mg/l, p < 0.05) after
   treatment. This decrease was associated with a diminution of HDL-apoE
   concentration (17.46 +/- 6.71 versus 13.37 +/- 6.05 mg/l, p < 0.05) and
   production rate (0.202 +/- 0.085 versus 0.119 +/- 0.047 mg/kg/day, p <
   0.05), whereas an increase in VLDL-apoE concentration (6.44 +/- 2.16
   before versus 9.23 +/- 4.02 mg/l after, p < 0.05) and production rate
   (0.827 +/- 0.367 versus 1.524 +/- 0.664 mg/kg/day, p < 0.05) was
   observed. No significant difference was observed after treatment for
   apoAI parameters. We conclude that atorvastatin treatment promotes
   different apoE distribution between HDL and VLDL, favoring VLDL apoE
   content. The increased number of apoE per VLDL particle suggests that
   atorvastatin could enhance the direct catabolism of triglyceride-rich
   VLDL through apoE receptor pathways.}},

Abstract = {{Excessive glutamate release is associated with neuronal damage. A new
   strategy for the treatment of neuronal injury involves inhibition of the
   neuropeptidase glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCP II), also known as
   N-acetylated alpha-linked acidic dipeptidase. GCP II is believed to
   mediate the hydrolysis of N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAAG) to
   glutamate and N-acetyl-aspartate, and inhibition of NAAG peptidase
   activity (by GCP II and other peptidases) is neuroprotective. Mice were
   generated in which the Folh1 gene encoding GCP II was disrupted
   (Folh1-/- mice). No overt behavioral differences were apparent between
   Folh1-/- mice and wild-type littermates, with respect to their overall
   performance in locomotion, coordination, pain threshold, cognition and
   psychiatric behavioral paradigms. Morphological analysis of peripheral
   nerves, however, showed significantly smaller axons (reduced myelin
   sheaths and axon diameters) in sciatic nerves from Folh1-/- mice.
   Following sciatic nerve crush, Folh1-/- mice suffered less injury and
   recovered faster than wild-type littermates. In a model of ischemic
   injury, the Folh1-/- mice exhibited a significant reduction (p < 0.05)
   in infarct volume compared with their wild-type littermates when
   subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion, a model of stroke. These
   findings support the hypothesis that GCP II inhibitors may represent a
   novel treatment for peripheral neuropathies as well as stroke.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Allergic eye diseases are complex inflammatory conditions of
   the conjunctiva that are becoming increasingly prevalent and present an
   increasing economic burden because of direct and indirect health
   expenditures.
   Objective: We sought to identify factors that may synergize with
   antigen-induced allergic inflammation and lead to allergic
   conjunctivitis. We used a murine model of allergic conjunctivitis to
   test the effect of oxidative stress generated by pollen oxidases using
   nicotinamide adenine dinuclecifide (reduced) or nicotinamide adenine
   dinucleotide phosphate (reduced) (NAD{[}P]H) as an electron donor
   present in pollen grains.
   Methods; Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by hydrated Ambrosia
   artemisiifolia pollen (short ragweed pollen; RWP) grains was determined
   by using 2'-7'-dihydrodichlorofluorescein diacetate, nitroblue
   tetrazolium reduction, and Amplex Red assay. The RWP-induced changes in
   intracellular ROS levels were examined in A549 cells, human primary
   bronchial epithelial cells, and murine conjunctiva.
   Results: Ragweed pollen grains contain NAD(P)H oxidase activity, which
   is diphenyleneiodonium-sensitive and quinacrine-sensitive and sodium
   azide-resistant. These NAD(P)H oxidases generate a superoxide anion that
   can be converted to H2O2 by pollen grain-associated superoxide
   dismutase. These diffusible oxygen radicals from pollen grains increase
   intracellular ROS levels in cultured epithelial cells and murine
   conjunctiva. Similar phenomena were observed in sensitized and naive
   mice, indicating that the RWP-induced oxidative stress in conjunctival
   epithelium is independent of adaptive immunity. Inactivation of NAD(P)H
   oxidase activity in RWP decreases the immediate-type hypersensitivity
   and inflammatory cell infiltration into the conjunctiva.
   Conclusion: Our data suggest that ROS generated by NAD(P)H oxidases in
   pollen grains intensify immediate allergic reactions and recruitment of
   inflammatory cells in murine conjunctiva.}},

Abstract = {{Stacked intrinsic Josephson junctions form in highly anisotropic
   high-T-c superconductors such as Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x. Josephson-vortex
   dynamics in such systems attracts much research interests, both academic
   and application points of view. In a dense Josephson-vortex state (in
   the range of 4-5 T external magnetic field applied in parallel with the
   junction planes) of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x stacked intrinsic Josephson
   junctions vortex-flow motion is in resonance with the collective plasma
   oscillation modes. With increasing magnetic fields beyond similar to 2 T
   hysteretic quasiparticle branches keep shrinking, while the collective
   Josephson-vortex-flow branches start appearing and become clearer. The
   Josephson-vortex-flow branches split into multiple sub-branches
   corresponding to the number of coupled junctions in the stack. The
   low-bias characteristics of the Josephson-vortex-flow sub-branches fit
   well to the inductive-capacitive hybrid coupling model. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Data reconciliation is a procedure that makes use of process models
   along with process measurements to give more precise and consistent
   estimates for process variables. Data reconciliation has been
   traditionally used to provide a more representative set of data to
   calculate steady-state inventories and process yields. For dynamic
   systems, the use of data reconciliation is relatively nascent. This
   article examines the potential use of data reconciliation in closed-loop
   control as a filter to attenuate the noise in measurements of the
   controlled variables so that the controllers can access more accurate
   sets of data. Data reconciliation filters were implemented in
   simulations of a PID control system for a binary distillation column.
   Results showed that data reconciliation could efficiently reduce the
   propagation Of measurement noise in control loops, so that the overall
   performance of the controller is enhanced.}},

Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{Large polymer filaments can form when drag reducing polymers are
   injected through wall slots. The presence of these structures enhances
   the performance of the drag reducing function by mechanisms which are
   not understood. This paper shows how particle image velocimetry (PIV)
   techniques can be used to study changes in the configuration of the
   injected polymer and in the structure of the velocity field with
   increasing drag reduction. The filaments are found to behave as solid
   bodies which break up in high shear regions close to a boundary. The
   breakup process provides an explanation of why the filaments are not
   observed close to a wall and offers the possibility of providing a
   heterogeneous distribution of small aggregates of polymers which could
   be more effective than uniformly distributed molecules as suggested by
   Hoyer and Gyr (J Non-Newton Fluid Mech 65:221-240, 1996; J Fluids Eng
   120:818-823, 1998), Dunlop and Cox (Phys Fluids 20:203-213, 1977) and

Title = {{The use of combined bladder and epispadias repair in boys with classic
   bladder exstrophy: Outcomes, complications and consequences}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Despite widespread use of modern staged reconstruction for
   classic bladder exstrophy, there remains a role for combined bladder
   closure and epispadias repair when primary closure is delayed or initial
   reconstruction has failed. The principle of combining bladder and
   urethral closure in 1 operation was first proposed more than 40 years
   ago, and represents a demanding technical procedure. We recount our
   experience to date with this approach.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 38 boys underwent combined bladder and
   epispadias repair using pelvic osteotomies. Five cases were delayed
   primary closures owing to a bladder template unsuitable for newborn
   closure. A total of 30 cases were previous failed bladder closures, with
   concurrent epispadias repair in 6. The 3 remaining cases were staged
   closures where the epispadias repair failed, leading to bladder prolapse
   via the posterior urethra. Overall, there was a major bladder prolapse
   in 25 cases, and separation of the pubic symphysis with dehiscence of
   anterior abdominal wall structures and bladder in 8.
   Results: Mean age at surgery was 26.5 months for the 33 reclosures. A
   total of 10 boys had development of a urethrocutaneous fistula and 4 had
   development of strictures. A total of 19 patients required additional
   procedures of the bladder neck (endoscopic), urethra or penis. A later
   bladder neck reconstruction was undertaken in 19 boys, of whom 12 are
   continent. Seven boys underwent continent diversion and 5 are
   considering the procedure. A total of 14 boys are awaiting adequate
   capacity for bladder neck reconstruction. Ureteral reimplantation was
   performed in 22 patients, and no patient was rendered hypospadiac.
   Conclusions: When combined closure is applied to failed previous
   exstrophy repair one can expect at best a 50\% continence rate without
   continent diversion. Furthermore, based on the experience at this
   institution the majority of patients require ureteral reimplantation,
   and many require additional surgery to the penis or urethra. However,
   with the application of modern reconstructive techniques continence and
   a cosmetically pleasing phallus can be expected in most cases, although
   at the expense of multiple surgical procedures.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Representational oligonucleotide microarray analysis has
   been developed for detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms and/or
   for genome copy number changes. In this process, the intensity of
   hybridization to oligonucleotides arrays is increased by hybridizing a
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified representation of reduced
   genomic. complexity However, hybridization to some oligonucleotides is
   not sufficiently high to allow precise analysis of that portion of the
   genome.
   Methods: In an effort to identify aspects of oligonucleotide
   hybridization affecting signal intensity, we explored the importance of
   the PCR product strand to which each oligonucleotide is homologous and
   the sequence of the array oligonucleotides. We accomplished this by
   hybridizing multiple PCR-amplified products to oligonucleotide arrays
   carrying two sense and two antisense 50-mer oligonucleotides for each
   PCR amplicon.
   Results: In some cases, hybridization intensity depended more strongly
   on the PCR amplicon strand (i.e., sense vs. antisense) than on the
   detection oligonucleotide sequence. in other cases, the oligonucleotide
   sequence seemed to dominate.
   Conclusion: Oligonucleotide arrays for analysis of DNA copy number or
   for single nucleotide polymorphism content should be designed to carry
   probes to sense and antisense strands of each PCR amplicon to ensure
   sufficient hybridization and signal intensity. (c) 2005 International

Abstract = {{Increased life expectancy of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)positive
   patients has led to evidence of complications apparently not directly
   related to immunodeficiency or opportunistic infection, including
   increased cardiovascular risk. We tested the hypothesis that vascular
   dysfunction occurs in the murine acquired immune deficiency syndrome (
   AIDS) model and evaluated potential mechanisms in murine AIDS tissues
   and relevant human HIV/AIDS vascular tissues. We also investigated
   endothelial activation and/or endothelial protein nitration and their
   association with time-dependent vascular dysfunction. At 1 and 5 wk of
   murine AIDS, statistically significant decreases in KCl contractility
   and time-dependent contractile deficits in response to phenylephrine
   were observed. The maximal response (E-max) was reduced by similar to
   40\% at 10 wk, and EC50 values were significantly changed: 102 +/- 7.3
   ng for control vs. 190 +/- 37 and 130 +/- 22 ng at 5 and 10 wk,
   respectively (P<0.05). Endothelium-dependent relaxation to ACh was
   decreased (EC50=120 +/- 27 and 343 +/- 94 nM for control and at 10 wk,
   respectively), whereas the response to an exogenous nitric oxide donor,
   sodium nitroprusside, remained unchanged, suggesting a specific
   endothelial dysfunction. Histochemical investigations of the same
   vascular tissues as well as corresponding coronary endothelium showed an
   increase in protein 3-nitrotyrosine, intercellular adhesion molecule,
   and nitric oxide synthase isoforms 2 and 3. These findings were
   corroborated in concurrent experiments in a cohort of well-cataloged
   human cardiac microvascular tissues. We have demonstrated, for the first
   time, a specific functional vasculopathy with endothelial involvement in
   a murine model of AIDS that was also associated with and correlated to
   increased oxidative stress and specific endothelial activation. This
   finding was echoed in a relevant population of human HIV/AIDS patients.
   Research into sources and intracellular targets of oxidants in this
   disease could provide important mechanistic insights and may reveal new
   therapeutic opportunities for this increasingly important cardiovascular
   disease state.}},

Abstract = {{From the time in 1965 when `Moore's Law' - doubling of circuit density
   every 18 months approximately was predicted, scaling of transistors has
   progressed in accordance with the law. This was primarily enabled by
   technological advances in manufacturing equipment that allowed the
   `printing' and manufacturing of smaller circuits. Occasionally,
   in-between, a new material was introduced in the manufacture of the
   circuits. However, from the 180 nm technology, new materials have been
   needed in every generation. As the circuit features get smaller, the
   necessity of new materials required becomes more apparent. The
   importance of these materials in the manufacturing of semiconductor
   devices will be illustrated in this paper along with some results.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the quintessence model with a minimally
   coupled scalar field in the context of recent supernovae observations.
   By choosing a particular form of the deceleration parameter q, which
   gives an early deceleration and late time acceleration for the dust
   dominated model, we show that this sign flip in q can be obtained by a
   simple trigonometric potential. The early matter dominated model expands
   with q = 1/2 as desired and enters a negative q phase quite late during
   the evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Accumulating evidence suggests the existence of a processing bias in
   favor of threat-related stimulation in anxious individuals. Using
   behavioral and ERP measures, the present study investigated the
   deployment of attention to face stimuli with different emotion
   expressions in high-anxious and low-anxious participants. An
   attention-shifting paradigm was used in which faces with neutral, angry,
   fearful, sad, or happy expressions were presented singly at fixation.
   Participants had to fixate on the face cue and then discriminate a
   target shape that appeared randomly above, below, to the left, or right
   of the fixated face. The behavioral data show that high-anxious
   participants were slower to respond to targets regardless of the emotion
   expressed by the face cue. In contrast, the ERP data indicate that
   threat-related faces elicited faster latencies and greater amplitudes of
   early ERP components in high-anxious than in low-anxious individuals.
   The between-group pattern in ERP waveforms suggests that the slower
   reaction times in high-anxious participants might reflect increased
   attentional dwelling on the face cues, rather than a general slowing of
   response enacting. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Pituitary cells, from seven 160- to 170-day-old pigs, were studied in
   primary culture to determine the affects NPY on LH and GH secretion at
   the level of the pituitary. On day 4 of culture, medium was discarded,
   plates were rinsed twice with serum-free medium and cells were cultured
   in 1 ml fresh medium without serum and challenged individually with
   10(-10), 10(-8) or 10(-6) M {[}Ala(15)]-h growth hormone-releasing
   factor-( 1-29)NH2 (GRF); 10(-9), 10(-8) or 10(-7) M GnRH or 10(-9),
   10(-8), 10(-7) or 10(-6) M NPY individually or in combinations with
   10(-9) or 10(-8) M GnRH or 10-8 or 10-6 M GRF. Cells were exposed to
   treatment for 4 h at which time medium was harvested and quantified for
   LH and GH. Basal LH secretion (control; n = 7 pituitaries) was 12 +/- 6
   ng/well. Relative to control at 4 h, 10(-9), 10(-8) and 10(-7) M GnRH
   increased (P < 0.01) LH secretion by 169, 176 and 197\%, respectively.
   Neuropeptide-Y did not alter (P > 0.4) basal LH secretion nor 10-8 M
   GnRH-induced increase in LH secretion but 10(-9) M GnRH-stimulated LH
   secretion was reduced by NPY and was not different from control or GnRH
   alone. Basal GH secretion (control; n = 7 pituitaries) was 56 +/- 12
   ng/well. Relative to control at 4 h, 10(-10), 10(-8) and 10(-6) M GRF
   increased GH secretion by 111\%, 125\% (P < 0.01) and 150\% (P < 0.01),
   respectively. Only 10(-6) M (134\%) and 10(-7) M (125\%) NPY increased
   (P < 0.04) basal GH secretion. Addition of 10(-9), 10(-8) and 10(-7) M
   NPY in combination with 10(-8) M GRF suppressed (P < 0.04)
   GRF-stimulated GH secretion. However, 10(-9) M NPY enhanced (P < 0.06)
   the GH response to 10(-6) M GRF. These results demonstrate that NPY may
   directly modulate GH secretion at the level of the pituitary gland.

Abstract = {{Despite the indifferent responses to the second and third instalments of
   `The Matrix' series, the trilogy is nevertheless a valuable contribution
   to popular debate about the human implications of a rapidly emerging
   technoculture. In this essay, I will develop a reading of the Matrix
   scenario, not so much as a cautionary warning about the folly of
   developing intelligent machines, but as a reflection on the moral
   meanings of becoming increasingly immersed in a technological milieu. I
   argue that whilst `The Matrix', the first of the trilogy, depicts a
   simplisitic opposition between humans and machines, `Reloaded' and
   `Revolutions' open up a more dialectical understanding of human meaning
   in a technological world and instead explore the tension between two
   competing moral trajectories of technological existence: the first, the
   unfolding of a bleak, nihilistic instrumentalism, the second, a
   reflexive recovery of human relationship made possible by the renewal of
   a moral ontology of sacrificial self-giving. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper analyses the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) on the
   development of local firms. We focus on two likely effects of FDI: A
   competition effect which deters entry of domestic firms and positive
   market externalities which foster the development of local industry.
   Using a simple theoretical model to illustrate how these forces work we
   show that the number of domestic firms follows a u-shaped curve, where
   the competition effect first dominates but is gradually outweighed by
   positive externalities. Evidence for Ireland tends to support this
   result. Specifically, applying semi-parametric regression techniques on
   plant level panel data for the manufacturing sector we find that while
   the competition effect may have initially deterred local firms' entry,
   this initial effect has been outpaced by positive externalities making
   the overall impact of FDI largely positive for the domestic industry.

Abstract = {{The solution to the Green and Ampt infiltration equation is expressible

   presented. Although these expansions do not converge near the branch
   point of the W function (corresponds to Green-Ampt infiltration with
   immediate ponding), a method is presented for approximating W-1 that is
   exact at the branch point and asymptotically, with interpolation between
   these limits. Some existing and several new simple and compact yet
   robust approximations applicable to Green-Ampt infiltration and flux are
   presented, the most accurate of which has a maximum relative error of 5

   significantly higher in cases with a more intense liquefaction
   degeneration (p < 0.01). There was no significant difference in basal

   importance of apoptosis was small in OLP. Epithelial cells attacked in

Abstract = {{Perturbations of Levitan almost periodic functions are defined as
   continuous bounded functions f : R -> X, X a Banach space, of the form f
   = u + v with v bounded and Levitan almost periodic and u with zero Bohr
   mean (vertical bar u vertical bar). It is shown that if c(0) is not an
   element of X, then the class PLAP(b) containing these functions
   satisfies the following condition (Delta): if f is an element of
   L-loc(1)(R, X) and f (center dot + h) - f(center dot) PLAP(b) for any h
   > 0, then f (center dot) - (1/h) integral(h)(0) f (center dot + s) ds is
   an element of PLAP(b). This has applications to the behavior of
   solutions of differential-difference equations, especially to the
   integration of pseudo almost periodic functions, PAP, to harmonic
   analysis and the structure of extensions ``M(n)PLAP(b),{''}
   ``M(n)PAP,{''} and the corresponding distributions. More generally, all
   this holds also for vector sums U + V with V containing almost periodic,
   almost automorphic, Levitan almost periodic or recurrent functions and
   perturbations U in suitable subsets of \{u : the Bohr mean (e(iw t)u(t))
   vanishes for all w is an element of R\}, for example, for U + V =
   generalized pseudo almost periodic functions GPAP. We also discuss the

Abstract = {{Freezing-thawing cycles are a major cause of degradation of concrete
   structures in cold climates. The use of air-entraining admixtures to
   induce an adequate network of closely spaced air bubbles in concrete has
   been proven to dramatically decrease its susceptibility to frost action.
   However, with the advent of high-strength high-performance concrete
   (HPC), the need for air-entrainment in such concrete has become a
   controversial issue since the 1980s. Some researchers advocate using
   air-entrainment in HPC, while others argue that this practice is
   unnecessary owing to the very low porosity and amount of freezable water
   in HPC. In this paper, an extensive review of the available literature
   indicates that there is substantial scatter and irreproducibility of
   data regarding this issue. There is also evidence of vulnerability of
   HPC to both micro and macrocracking in service and a demonstrated
   reduction in performance under combined ageing mechanisms. This could
   make non-air-entrained HPC vulnerable to freezing-thawing degradation
   even though such vulnerability may not be detected using classical frost
   durability tests. Moreover, there are practical limitations to the use
   of very low water/cement ratio concrete in field conditions, which make
   the production of HPC with negligible freezable water content difficult
   to achieve in full-scale structures. This paper presents evidence that
   supports the argument that the use of air-entrainment in HPC is a
   practice that provides enhanced safety, reliability and serviceability,
   and is therefore recommended for concrete practitioners.}},

Abstract = {{Background: This prospective cross-sectional cohort study examined the
   relationship between radiographic anatomy and the severity of OSAHS. The
   severity of OSAHS can be measured subjectively in terms of the Epworth
   scale and objectively in terms of the apnoea/hypopnoea Index (AHI).
   Methods: 121 lateral cephalometric radiographs were traced under uniform
   conditions and a series of 56 landmarks identified, from which 48
   angular and linear measurements were made. Significant changes occurred
   when comparison of these measurements with the severity of OSAHS were
   made. Results: Body mass index (BMI), the maxillary-mandibular planes
   angle (MMPA) and the linear measurement between points 7 and 12, (the
   pharyngeal dimension measured from the tip of the soft palate to the
   corresponding horizontal point on the posterior pharynx), increased
   significantly with increasing severity of OSAHS as measured by the
   Epworth score. Overjet, lower lip length, and the distance from the
   hyoid bone to a point B on the mandible all increased significantly with
   increasing severity of OSAHS, as measured by the AHI. The hyoid bone was
   found to rotate counter clockwise as the severity of OSAHS increased, as
   a result the distance between the most anterior superior point on the
   hyoid bone and the maxillary plane was seen to decrease as severity of
   OSAHS increased in terms of AHI. Conclusions: Some radiographic
   anatomical features show significant change as the severity of OSAHS
   increases and these features could be used in the identification of
   patients who have severe OSAHS. The Logit equation derived from the
   findings of this study may also be a useful clinical tool in predicting
   the likelihood of a subject suffering from severe OSAHS.}},

Abstract = {{Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is rare in the pediatric
   population. Little information exists on the progression of the disease
   in children. This study evaluated the experience with PSC at the
   Children's Hospital of Philadelphia over the past 20 years, with an
   emphasis on the histologic features at presentation, during disease
   progression, and after liver transplantation. We retrospectively
   reviewed the medical records of patients diagnosed with PSC between 1981
   and 2001. Nineteen patients met the inclusion criteria with classic
   radiographic evidence of PSC. One additional patient with normal biliary
   imaging was subsequently diagnosed at the time of liver transplantation.
   The 20 patients with PSC (14 males) ranged in age from 1 month to 15
   years at time of presentation. Inflammatory bowel disease was evident in
   50\% of patients. Initial histology revealed advanced disease (bridging
   fibrosis or cirrhosis) in 13 patients and an earlier histologic stage in
   7 patients. Of the latter, 3 remain stable, 2 required transplantation,
   and 2 were lost to follow-up. Seven of the 13 patients with advanced
   disease required orthotopic liver transplantation, and 3 of these
   subsequently showed recurrence of primary disease in the allograft.
   Thus, most subjects presented insidiously at an advanced stage that
   required transplantation. Subjects who presented at an earlier stage
   progressed or remained stable, but the histologic findings at diagnosis
   were generally not predictive of disease progression. Recurrence of PSC
   after transplantation is a significant complication in children.}},

Abstract = {{This letter outlines a novel and robust algorithm for identifying
   seismic events within low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) passive seismic
   data in real time. Since the event detection problem is a continuous,
   real-time process which has nonlinear mathematical representations, a
   Rao-Blackwellized particle filter (RBPF) is utilized. In this algorithm,
   a jump Markov linear Gaussian system (JMLGS) is defined where changes
   (i.e., jumps) in the state-space system and measurement equations are
   due to the occurrences and losses of events within the measurement
   noise. The RBPF obtains optimal estimates of the possible seismic events
   by individually weighting and subsequently summing a bank of Kalman
   filters (KFs). These KFs are specified and updated by samples drawn from
   a Markov chain distribution which defines the probability of the
   individual dynamical systems which compose the JMLGS. In addition, a
   hidden Markov model filter is utilized within the RBPF filter
   formulation so that real-time estimates of the phase of the seismic
   event can be obtained. The filter is demonstrated to provide up to an
   80-fold improvement in the SNR when processing simulated seismic data
   with Gauss-Markov measurement noise.}},

Abstract = {{The Duromer molded interconnect device (MID) technology for realization
   of a stackable system-in-package (SiP) is similar to conventional MID
   technology, which is usually realized using thermoplastic polymers,
   combining the functionality of housing and substrate into one device.
   Advantages of the conventional MID technology are the reduction of parts
   during assembly by integrating mechanical and electrical functionality
   into a device and the reduction of space, as MID allows a
   three-dimensional (3-D) integration of devices. A disadvantage of
   conventional technology, especially if combined with typical technical
   thermoplastics, is the large mismatch in coefficient of thermal
   expansion (CTE) between substrate and advanced microelectronic
   components as chip scale package (CSP) or flip-chip. This is reducing
   the applicability of thermoplastic MID to moderate temperature ranges
   and/or to rather robust components. To overcome this disadvantage, the
   use of low CTE duromer as epoxy molding compounds (EMCs) as base
   material for device assembly is proposed, generating a unique technology
   well adapted to SiP and microelectromechanical system (MEMS) packaging
   needs, the Duromer MID approach. The technological realization of
   Duromer MID uses conventional backend processes as IC bonding to flex,
   transfer molding using epoxy molding compounds, laser machining,
   metallization, and structurization processes well known from PCB
   processing. The use of existing equipment allows both a rather fast
   process implementation and a cost-effective manufacturing of the
   components. Within this paper, the investigations described previously
   are driven further toward a description of a generic packaging
   technology integrating detailed analysis of metallization processes and
   assembly issues. Summarized, this paper presents further process
   development and feasibility analysis of wafer-level packaging
   technologies for SiP solutions based on a Duromer MID approach.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proves exponential separations between depth d-LK and depth
   (d + (1)/(2))-LK for every d epsilon (1)/N-2 utilizing the order
   induction principle. As a consequence, we obtain an exponential
   separation between depth d-LK and depth (d + 1)-LK for d epsilon N. We
   investigate the relationship between the sequence-size, tree-size and
   height of depth d-LK-derivations for d epsilon (1)/N-2, and describe
   transformations between them.
   We define a general method to lift principles requiring exponential
   tree-size (d + (1)/(2))-LK-refutations for d epsilon N to principles
   requiring exponential sequence-size d-LK-refutations, which will be
   described for the Ramsey principle and d = 0. From this we also deduce
   width lower bounds for resolution refutations of the Ramsey principle.

Abstract = {{Undisplaced scaphoid fractures are easily missed on conventional
   scaphoid radiographs, but these occult fractures may seriously impair
   hand function. Routine bone scintigraphy (BS) is often advocated if
   there are clinical signs of a scaphoid fracture without radiological
   evidence. However, the results require careful therapeutic management.
   Objective: To determine the diagnostic value of BS in daily practice for
   clinically suspected scaphoid fractures.
   Methods: We evaluated our protocol of routine BS in suspected scaphoid
   fractures.
   Subjects: In a retrospective study, we analysed 111 consecutive cases
   with signs of a scaphoid fracture on physical examination. Radiographs
   revealed 55 fractures, the remaining 56 patients all underwent BS.
   Main results: On average, the BS was performed after 4 days. It showed a
   fracture in 38/56 of the patients. The distribution of fractures was:
   scaphoid bone 15, distal radius 11, other carpal bones 9 and metacarpal
   bones 3.
   Conclusion: If there is a strong clinical suspicion of a scaphoid
   fracture, which cannot be confirmed by conventional radiology, BS is a
   valuable diagnostic tool (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The electronic structure and spin-dependent tunneling in epitaxial
   Fe/MgO/Fe(001) tunnel junctions are studied using first-principles

   bands at the two interfaces make a significant contribution to the
   tunneling conductance for the antiparallel magnetization, whereas these
   bands are, in practice, mismatched by disorder and/or small applied bias
   for the parallel magnetization. This explains the experimentally
   observed decrease in tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) for thin MgO
   barriers. We predict that a monolayer of Ag epitaxially deposited at the
   interface between Fe and MgO suppresses tunneling through the interface
   band and may thus be used to enhance the TMR for thin barriers.}},

Abstract = {{We have previously shown that 1 h, but not 6 h, of daily access to IV
   cocaine induces a sensitized response to IV cocaine challenge after 14
   days of withdrawal. Here we tried to replicate these results using an IP
   cocaine challenge and adding a group of animals that had 1 h daily
   access to cocaine, but maintained levels of administration comparable to
   that of saline animals (i.e. a Coc group). Since addiction-associated
   neuroadaptations are particularly long lasting, we also tested the
   response to cocaine challenge after a longer withdrawal period of 60
   days. Rats had daily access to IV self-administered saline or cocaine
   for 1 h (Coclh), or to cocaine for 6 h (Coc6h) over 8 days.
   Subsequently, after 14 days of withdrawal only Coc animals showed a
   sensitized locomotor response to cocaine challenge administered IP.
   After 60 days of withdrawal, IP cocaine failed to produce a sensitized
   response in Coc 1h animals and produced a tolerant response in Coc6h
   animals. The present data support the notion that 6 h of daily access to
   cocaine leads to different neuroadaptations than those resulting from 1
   h of daily access to the drug. In addition, these data further
   demonstrate a dissociation between sensitization and addiction to
   cocaine. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to evaluate in rats the impact of cigarette smoke
   inhalation (CSI) and nicotine administration (NA) on a periodontal
   healing model in the absence of a plaque biofilm. Wistar rats (n = 42)
   were assigned to three groups: Group 1, control (n = 14); Group 2, NA (3
   mg kg(-1)) (n = 14); and Group 3, CSI (n = 14). Thirty days after CSI
   and NA exposure, fenestration defects were created buccally to the
   distal root of the first mandibular molar. The animals were killed 21 d
   later and their mandibles were processed for histological examination.
   The percentage of bone fill and the density of newly formed bone were
   assessed histometrically. Intergroup analysis demonstrated that compared
   to the control and NA groups, CSI was associated with a reduced rate of
   bone repair. No new cementum had been formed along the root surface in
   any of the three groups. It is concluded that cigarette smoke reduces
   the self-healing capacity of periodontal tissues.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To analyze the effect of an 8-wk training program on the energy
   cost of running (C) and the performance of 16 recreational males.
   Methods: A training group (TG, N = 8, 25.3 +/- 2.9 yr, 183.6 +/- 7.3 cm,
   80.9 +/- 9.6 kg) and a control group (CG, N = 8, 24.3 +/- 3.7 yr, 179.3
   +/- 6.1 cm, 75.5 +/- 8.0 kg) performed three. two-stage tests (TST) at
   weeks 0, 4, and 8 (W0, W4, W8). Speeds of the first (v-slow) and second
   stage (v-fast) were 2.4 +/- 0.3 vs 2.5 +/- 0.4 m center dot s(-1) and
   3.7 +/- 0.3 vs 3.9 +/- 0.4 m center dot s(-1) (TG vs CG), respectively.
   Maximum running time at v-fast (T) served as the measure of performance.
   C was calculated from oxygen uptake above rest, blood lactate
   concentration, and speed. The TG trained 3-5x wk(-1) at an HR of +/- 10
   beats of the HR measured at v-slow at W0 (161 +/- 12 bpm). The CG did
   not train. Results: At WO, there were no significant differences between
   the groups in T (377 +/- 47 vs 335 +/- 34 s) and C (v-slow: 4.1 +/- 0.3
   vs 4.3 +/- 0.4 J center dot kg(-1)center dot m(-1); v-fast: 4.2 +/- 0.4
   vs 4.0 +/- 0.4 J center dot kg(-1)center dot m(-1)). In the CG, T and C
   remained almost unchanged at W4 (363 +/- 38 s, 4.0 +/- 0.4 J center dot
   kg(-1)center dot m(-1)) and at W8 (342 +/- 49 s, 4.0 +/- 0.3 J center
   dot kg(-1)center dot m(-1)). In the TG, T increased (P < 0.05) at W4
   (469 +/- 45 s) and at W8 (591 +/- 109 s). At v-fast, also C increased (P
   < 0.05) at W8 (4.6 +/- 0.4 J center dot kg(-1)center dot m(-1)), whereas
   at v-slow, C decreased (P < 0.05) at W4 (3.7 +/- 0.4 J center dot
   kg(-1)center dot m(-1)) with no further change at W8 (3.7 +/- 0.4 J
   center dot kg(-1)center dot m(-1)). Conclusion: The training
   successfully increased running performance in terms of T. During the
   initial training period, C could be reduced at the speed predominantly
   used in training. However, at high running speeds, C may even increase
   if the corresponding running time is largely increased.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the relationship between the type of business
   advisors used by SMEs and the level of impact and satisfaction a SME
   receives. The role of other influences, such as the intensity and cost
   of the service, and the level of commitment to an advisor by the client
   are also investigated. A structural equation path model is estimated
   from survey information for SMEs in Britain. The analysis shows that
   customer impact, satisfaction and re-use intentions are related to the
   character of the firm (particularly its size), the intensity and cost of
   services, but is only marginally influenced by the geographical distance
   between advisor and client. Affective commitment, measured by the level
   of the `trust' of the advisor by the client, is shown not to be
   significant, except for public sector and business association
   suppliers. The importance of trust to these suppliers, despite the low
   satisfaction levels they achieve, is argued to be incompatible with
   attempts to charge fees, as has been sought for the government network
   of Business Link. Both business associations and public sector support
   bodies therefore have severe limitations in combining their broader
   roles with a commercially-based fee- based income strategy.}},

Abstract = {{1. We compared the baseline phosphorus (P) concentrations inferred by
   diatom-P transfer functions and export coefficient models at 62 lakes in
   Great Britain to assess whether the techniques produce similar estimates
   of historical nutrient status.
   2. There was a strong linear relationship between the two sets of values
   over the whole total P (TP) gradient (2-200 mu g TP L-1). However, a
   systematic bias was observed with the diatom model producing the higher
   values in 46 lakes (of which values differed by more than 10 mu g TP L-1
   in 21). The export coefficient model gave the higher values in 10 lakes
   (of which the values differed by more than 10 mu g TP L-1 in only 4).
   3. The difference between baseline and present-day TP concentrations was
   calculated to compare the extent of eutrophication inferred by the two
   sets of model output. There was generally poor agreement between the
   amounts of change estimated by the two approaches. The discrepancy in
   both the baseline values and the degree of change inferred by the models
   was greatest in the shallow and more productive sites.
   4. Both approaches were applied to two lakes in the English Lake
   District where long-term P data exist, to assess how well the models
   track measured P concentrations since approximately 1850. There was good
   agreement between the pre-enrichment TP concentrations generated by the
   models. The diatom model paralleled the steeper rise in maximum soluble
   reactive P (SRP) more closely than the gradual increase in annual mean
   TP in both lakes. The export coefficient model produced a closer fit to
   observed annual mean TP concentrations for both sites, tracking the
   changes in total external nutrient loading.
   5. A combined approach is recommended, with the diatom model employed to
   reflect the nature and timing of the in-lake response to changes in
   nutrient loading, and the export coefficient model used to establish the
   origins and extent of changes in the external load and to assess
   potential reduction in loading under different management scenarios.
   6. However, caution must be exercised when applying these models to
   shallow lakes where the export coefficient model TP estimate will not
   include internal P loading from lake sediments and where the diatom TP
   inferences may over-estimate TP concentrations because of the high
   abundance of benthic taxa, many of which are poor indicators of trophic
   state.}},

Abstract = {{Spermatogenesis takes place within the testicular seminiferous tubules
   which consist of the peritubular lamina propria and the seminiferous
   epithelium. The latter is composed of germ cells and somatic Sertoli
   cells. Sertoli cells trigger germ cell development by mediating
   follicle-stimulating hormone and androgen hormonal stimuli.
   Spermatogenesis comprises proliferation of spermatogonia, meiosis of
   spermatocytes, and differentiation of spermatids into spermatozoa
   (spermiogenesis). There are six distinct and specific germ cell
   associations (I-VI). These ``stages of spermatogenesis{''} occur
   sequentially along the length of a tubule. Different defects in
   spermatogenesis occur in adjacent seminiferous tubules (mixed atrophy)
   and are associated with deficits in differentiation of Sertoli cells.
   Biopsy specimens should be fixed in Bouin's solution.
   Diagnosis of preinvasive carcinoma in situ is based on the
   immunohistochemical demonstration of placental-like alkaline phosphatase
   (PLAP), which is expressed exclusively in carcinoma in situ cells.
   Histological evaluation should be performed using a score count system,
   and the use of histological techniques for protein and mRNA expression.
   Testicular biopsy should only be performed in accordance with strict
   indication criteria, and histological evaluation should be carried out
   in specialist centres, i.e. as recommended by the European Academy of
   Andrology (EAA).}},

Abstract = {{The mismatch negativity (MMN) component of auditory event-related brain
   potentials can be used as a probe to study the representation of sounds
   in auditory sensory memory (ASM). Yet it has been shown that an auditory
   MMN can also be elicited by an illusory auditory deviance induced by
   visual changes. This suggests that some visual information may be
   encoded in ASM and is accessible to the auditory MMN process. It is not
   known, however, whether visual information affects ASM representation
   for any audiovisual event or whether this phenomenon is limited to
   specific domains in which strong audiovisual illusions occur. To
   highlight this issue, we have compared the topographies of MMNs elicited
   by non-speech audiovisual stimuli deviating from audiovisual standards
   on the visual, the auditory, or both dimensions. Contrary to what occurs
   with audiovisual illusions, each unimodal deviant elicited
   sensory-specific MMNs, and the MMN to audiovisual deviants included both
   sensory components. The visual MMN was, however, different from a
   genuine visual MMN obtained in a visual-only control oddball paradigm,
   suggesting that auditory and visual information interacts before the MMN
   process occurs. Furthermore, the MMN to audiovisual deviants was
   significantly different from the sum of the two sensory-specific MMNs,
   showing that the processes of visual and auditory change detection are
   not completely independent.}},

Abstract = {{Recent developments in molecular biology have markedly speeded the
   processes involved in determining the molecular etiology of human
   Mendelian disorders. Nowhere are these changes more evident than in the
   field that is variously termed molecular dysmorphology, human
   morphogenesis, or human developmental biology. In contrast to the rapid
   changes in molecular genetics analysis, the processes and approaches of
   the clinical component of molecular dysmorphology have not changed
   substantially, and clinical analysis is therefore becoming relatively
   slower than molecular discovery. If clinical discovery is to maintain
   its deserved position at the forefront of human genetics research, new
   methods must be developed to acquire, archive, and analyze these data.
   The limitations of current phenotyping, specifically, the limitations of
   the collection and archiving of clinical data in medical journal case
   reports and case series manuscripts are demonstrated. Several
   provocative approaches that have been proposed to advance the field of
   clinical analysis are reviewed. Lastly, a specific proposal for a system
   of clinical analysis and archiving of data on human pleiotropic
   developmental anomaly syndromes is proposed to address these
   limitations.}},

Abstract = {{Estimates of the thickness of the ice shell of Europa range from < 1 to
   > 30 km. The higher values are generally assumed to be estimates of the
   entire ice shell thickness, which may include a lower ductile layer of
   ice, whereas many of the smaller thickness estimates are based on
   analyses that only consider that portion of the ice layer that behaves
   elastically at a particular strain rate. One example of the latter is
   flexure analysis, in which the elastic ice layer is modeled as a plate
   or sphere that is flexed under the weight of a surface load. We present
   calculations based on flexure analysis in which we model the elastic ice
   layer as flexing under a line-load caused by ridges. We use precisely
   located, parallel flanking cracks as indicators of the location of
   greatest tensile stress induced by flexure. Our elastic thickness
   results are spatially variable: similar to 500-2200 m (two sites) and
   similar to 200-1000 m (one site). Thorough analysis of Europan flexure
   studies performed by various researchers shows that the type of model
   selected causes the greatest variability in the thickness results,
   followed by the choice of Young's modulus, which is poorly constrained
   for the Europan ice shell. Comparing our results to those of previously
   published flexure analyses for Europa, we infer spatial variability in
   the elastic ice thickness (at the time of load emplacement), with smooth
   bands having the thinnest elastic ice thickness of all areas studied.
   Because analysis of flexure-induced fracturing can only reveal the
   elastic thickness at the time of load emplacement, calculated thickness
   variability between features having different ages may also reflect a
   temporal variability in the thickness of Europa's ice shell. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{To obtain data about select zoonotic and other infectious diseases in
   free-ranging predators in five ecoregions in Nebraska, sera were
   collected from 67 coyotes (Canis latrans) and 63 raccoons (Procyon
   lotor) from November 2002 through January 2003. For coyotes, antibodies
   were detected against canine distemper virus (CDV, 61\%), Francisella
   tularensis (32\%), Rickettsia rickettsi (13\%), and flaviviruses (48\%).
   None of the coyote sera had antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi, Brucella
   canis, or six serovars of Leptospira interrogans. Because serologic
   cross-reactivity exists among flaviviruses, 14 sera from
   flavivirus-positive coyotes were also tested for St. Louis encephalitis
   virus (SLE) antibodies and two (14\%) were positive, suggesting that tip
   to 48\% of coyotes tested had antibodies against West Nile virus (WNV).
   For raccoons, antibodies were detected against CDV (33\%), F. tularensis
   (38\%), and three serovars of L. interrogans (11\%).}},

Abstract = {{Previous reports have shown that obesity is a risk factor for carpal
   tunnel syndrome (CTS). This study was performed to investigate whether
   this could be confirmed in a large, existing cohort of patients and to
   explore the interaction between age and body mass index (BMI) as risk
   factors. Demographic and clinical data were collected from 6096 patients
   referred to a subregional neurophysiology service for diagnosis of
   possible CTS. Patients presenting with their second CTS and those with
   diabetes or thyroid disease were excluded. Subjects in whom nerve
   conduction studies (NCS) confirmed CTS were compared with those having
   normal NCS. After exclusions, there were 4166 patients for analysis of
   whom 11 had incomplete data. A total of 2408 of 4155 proved to have
   definite neurophysiological evidence of CTS. Of these patients, 1150
   were over the age of 63 years. Univariate and multivariate analyses
   demonstrated that increased BMI is a significant independent risk factor
   for CTS in patients under the age of 63 years, but is less important in
   older patients. Patients over the age of 63 years have a different
   pattern of risk factors for CTS than younger patients. This suggests
   that CTS in the elderly population may have different underlying
   pathogenetic mechanisms.}},

Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{For the characterization of particulate systems, various measuring
   techniques exist. Many of these assume that the particles are spherical
   in order to compute a particle size distribution (PSD) from the measured
   data. However, in many applications the shape of the particles deviates
   from a sphere, and as a consequence the computed PSD will contain errors
   because of this violated assumption. Measuring techniques that do not
   require this a priori assumption are, for example, those that measure
   the chord lengths of the particles. A disadvantage of the latter
   techniques is that the interpretation of the chord length distribution
   (CLD) is less transparent than the interpretation of a shape-based PSD
   (the PSD given an assumed particle shape). To facilitate the
   interpretation of a CLD, an algorithm based on least squares
   optimization techniques is presented. This algorithm computes the
   shape-based PSD that best explains the measured CLD and can, for
   example, discriminate spheres from rods using information of the CLD
   only. Knowledge about the type of PSD (e.g., Gaussian or log-normal) is
   not required.}},

Title = {{Operative strategies in the treatment of upper limb fractures in
   polytraumatized patients}},
Journal = {{UNFALLCHIRURG}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{843+}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background. Optimal timing of operative treatment of upper extremity
   long bone fractures in polytraumatized patients depends on the type and
   location of the fractures, as well as on the cardiorespiratory stability
   of the patient, and should be early in diaphyseal fractures in order to
   optimize intensive care treatment. The timing of surgery in cases of
   upper limb fractures is secondary to life-saving therapies. The same
   applies to stabilization of fractures of the lower limbs, including
   fractures of the femur and tibial shaft.
   Methods. The recommended operative procedure for adult polytraumatized
   patients with closed or open humeral shaft fractures of grade I or II is
   intramedullary nailing or plating. For closed or open lower arm
   fractures of grade I or II, plating is the best procedure, or
   alternatively nailing. For upper extremity epi- or metaphyseal fractures
   plating is preferred. Specific fracture situations require specific
   operative treatments, for example traction band for olecranon fractures,
   external fixation for distal radial multifragmentary fractures. The
   external fixator may be the optimal approach in grade III open fractures
   of the upper extremity long bones. The main difference in paediatric
   fractures is not the timing of the procedure, but the selection of the
   technique, which has to respect the epiphyseal growth plates.
   Results. Additional vessel injuries require quick diagnosis and early
   vessel reconstruction in the presence of cardiopulmonary stability. Open
   fractures should have a higher therapeutic priority if they are
   associated with vessel/nerve lesions. The strategy in additional nerve
   injuries depends on the type of lesion. Nerve decompression should take
   place together with fracture stabilization; necessary nerve
   reconstruction should be performed secondarily. The primary phase should
   be limited to fracture fixation. If the fracture is combined with a
   compartment syndrome, decompression by fasciotomy together with fracture
   fixation ensuring cardiopulmonary stability has be performed.
   Conclusion. Amputations at the upper extremity in polytraumatized
   patients are only occasionally indicated in very severe injuries. In
   injuries involving total amputation, depending on the condition of the
   limb, immediate reattachment should be attempted if the
   cardiorespiratory situation of the patient is stable.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Randomized trials and animal models demonstrate that
   leukoreduction of transfusions can reduce the risk of post-operative
   infections. We performed a retrospective study of sepsis related to
   indwelling venous access devices (line related infections) before and
   after the July 2000 implementation of universal leukoreduction.
   Methods: Line related infection data were collected from hospital
   infection control records for an 18-month period before and after July
   2000. Transfusion histories were obtained from transfusion service
   records.
   Results: Line related infections decreased in number from 150 to 98
   (-35\%) in transfused patients after implementation of universal
   leukoreduction, whereas line related infections increased from 41 to 45
   (+10\%) in nontransfused patients (p = 0.04). This corresponded to a
   decrease from 5.3 to 3.3 infections/10,000 patient days in transfused
   patients (p = 0.002). The infection rate remained stable in
   nontransfused patients at 1.5 infections/10,000 patient days both pre-
   and postimplementation of universal leukoreduction. Quantitatively
   similar decreases (33-45\%) were seen in transfused surgical, medical
   and pediatric patients.
   Conclusion: A substantial and statistically significant decrease in line
   related infections occurred coincident with implementation of universal
   leukoreduction. These improved outcomes were observed in transfused but
   not nontransfused patients, across all clinical services, suggesting a
   causal relationship with universal leukoreduction.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To explore pharmacokinetic factors underlying the poor
   bacteriologic eradication rate with a single 500-mg dose of ceftriaxone
   for streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis and to identify the minimum
   ceftriaxone dose required for effective treatment.
   Methods. Population modeling techniques were applied to pharmacokinetic
   data derived from paired plasma and tonsil samples from 153 children to
   assess the contribution of pharmacokinetic variability to patients'
   responses to ceftriaxone. In addition, a Monte Carlo simulation was
   performed to determine (1) the amount of time that free ceftriaxone
   concentrations must exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of
   group A Streptococcus to achieve bacteriologic eradication and (2) the
   ceftriaxone dose required to maintain free drug concentrations above the
   target MIC for the requisite amount of time. Ceftriaxone MICs for group
   A Streptococcus were obtained from a previous trial, in which all MICs
   (n = 115) were <= 0.064 mg/L; 33.9\% were susceptible at <= 0.016 mg/ L,
   66.4\% were susceptible at 0.032 mg/ L, and 1.7\% were susceptible at
   0.064 mg/ L.
   Results. Mean population pharmacokinetic parameters and their variances
   reflected substantial variability of clearance and half-life in the
   target population. Tonsillar ceftriaxone protein binding was 89.1\%. The
   proportions of 1000 simulated patients with free ceftriaxone
   concentrations that exceeded MICs of 0.016 mg/ L, 0.032 mg/ L, and 0.064
   mg/ L at 24 hours were 71.7\%, 65.4\%, and 57.2\%, respectively, and at
   48 hours were 41.8\%, 35.8\%, and 28.6\%, respectively. The amount of
   time that free ceftriaxone concentrations need to exceed MIC to achieve
   bacteriologic success was estimated to be 36 hours. Using this time
   criterion, two 500-mg doses of ceftriaxone separated by 18 hours should
   achieve a bacteriologic cure rate of similar to 95\%.
   Conclusions. Pharmacokinetic variability and high ceftriaxone tonsillar
   protein binding explain the high microbiologic failure rate for a single
   500-mg dose of ceftriaxone in group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis.
   Monte Carlo simulation suggests that a second dose administered 18 hours
   after the first will be required to achieve an acceptable bacteriologic
   cure rate.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To report a case of antidepressant-induced adverse drug
   reactions in a patient with hemorrhagic stroke.
   CASE SUMMARY: A 56-year-old man developed life-threatening adverse
   reactions after fluoxetine was added to his previously prescribed
   regimen of buspirone and olanzapine. One week after starting fluoxetine
   60 mg/day, the patient developed syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic
   hormone secretion and serotonin syndrome concurrently. The patient had
   experienced a hemorrhagic stroke before the adverse drug reactions
   occurred.
   DISCUSSION: A patient with a history of hemorrhagic stroke developed
   serious adverse drug reactions when fluoxetine was added to his drug
   therapy. When the combination therapy was stopped, all adverse effects
   gradually disappeared and laboratory abnormalities were corrected. The
   likelihood that the adverse reactions were caused by fluoxetine is
   probable according to the Naranjo probability scale. In addition, a
   history of stroke may be a risk factor for the development of such
   reactions.
   CONCLUSIONS: Today, patients with depression after experiencing a stroke
   are treated more effectively, but antidepressant-induced adverse drug
   reactions may be serious. A growing number of patients are treated for
   post-stroke depression; they require close supervision and careful
   dosing of antidepressants to prevent full-blown adverse reactions from
   occurring.}},

   the multimatrix models and focus on two-matrix models with bilinear
   couplings. We show how to solve this models in an exact way, without
   resorting to the customary saddle point/large N approximation. The
   method consists of solving the quantum equations of motion and using the
   flow equations of the underlying integrable hierarchy to derive explicit
   expressions for correlators. Finally, we show how to incorporate in this
   formalism the description of several group of D-branes wrapped around

Abstract = {{Intense physical exercise represents a condition that is often
   associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species and free
   radicals in various tissues; supplementation of antioxidants may be
   desirable to reduce oxidative stress and provide a larger protective
   margin against its possible consequences. The aim of the present study
   was to evaluate, in a group of professional handball players, the
   effects of short-term dietary supplementation with a standardized red
   orange extract (containing anthocyanins, flavanones, hydroxycinnamic
   acids, and ascorbic acid; Red Orange Complex {[}ROC]) on some
   noninvasive biomarkers of oxidative stress. Eighteen professional
   handball players and 17 healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study.
   The supplementation consisted of 50 mg ROC per capsule in micronized
   form; all subjects were recommended to take 1 capsule twice a day for 2
   months. The end points of oxidative stress taken in consideration were
   the serum total antioxidant status, the serum level of thiol groups,
   lipid hydroperoxides and malondialdehyde, and the frequency of
   spontaneous sister chromatide exchanges in peripheral lymphocytes. The
   results obtained clearly reflect an overall lower level of oxidative
   stress in the athletes examined after short-term dietary supplementation
   with the ROC. Dietary supplementation with the ROC (which is endowed
   with strong antioxidant capacity) is able to decrease oxidative stress
   and thus might protect against its short- and long-term health
   consequences in athletes engaged in regular training programs. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{From a controls point of view, micro electromechanical systems (MEMS)
   can be driven in an open-loop and closed-loop fashion. Commonly, these
   devices are driven open-loop by applying simple input signals. If these
   input signals become more complex by being derived from the system
   dynamics, we call such control techniques pre-shaped open-loop driving.
   The ultimate step for improving precision and speed of response is the
   introduction of feedback, e.g. closed-loop control. Unlike macro
   mechanical systems, where the implementation of the feedback is
   relatively simple, in the MEMS case the feedback design is quite
   problematic, due to the limited availability of sensor data, the
   presence of sensor dynamics and noise, and the typically fast actuator
   dynamics. Furthermore, a performance comparison between open-loop and
   closed-loop control strategies has not been properly explored for MEMS
   devices. The purpose of this paper is to present experimental results
   obtained using both open- and closed-loop strategies and to address the
   comparative issues of driving and control for MEMS devices. An optical
   MEMS switching device is used for this study. Based on these
   experimental results, as well as computer simulations, we point out
   advantages and disadvantages of the different control strategies,
   address the problems that distinguish MEMS driving systems from their
   macro counterparts, and discuss criteria to choose a suitable control
   driving strategy.}},

Abstract = {{We report our single centre experience with a new fractally coated
   myocardial unipolar lead (ELC35UP; Biotronik) in 96 pediatric patients
   (59\% male, 41\% female). Congenital heart disease (CHD) was associated
   in 89\%. The age at implantation ranged between 2 days and 19 years,
   median for children with CHD 7.8 years, without CHD 4.7 years. Twenty
   percent of the children were younger than one year at implantation. Mean
   follow-up was 30 months (1-57 months). We compared our findings with a
   steroid eluting epicardial lead (CapSure EPI 4968; Medtronic) in 46
   children with comparable age and sex-distribution. We found a lead
   survival of 87\% after 57 months in the ELC35UP group (steroid lead:
   87\% after 129 months). Pacing energy thresholds were equal after 12
   months (median 3.0 microjoules), but the sensing characteristics of the
   fractally coated lead was significantly superior to the steroid eluting
   lead with median R waves of 7.0 mV (steroid lead: 3.5 mV) after 12
   months. Children with myocardial scar tissue requiring pacemaker therapy
   after surgery of CHD showed no differences in sensing and pacing
   thresholds in comparison to children with congenital rhythm disorders.
   The fractally coated screw-in lead offers technical advantages
   concerning the subxiphoidal implantation procedure.
   Conclusion: Fractally coated ventricular screw-in leads represent a
   feasible alternative to the common steroid eluting leads- especially in
   children requiring pacemaker therapy after surgery for CHD.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The purpose of this study was to determine the total content
   of trans fatty acids (TFA) in subcutaneous, retroperitoneal and visceral
   fat of morbidly obese and non-obese patients submitted to bariatric
   surgery or plastic and abdominal surgery.
   Methods: The adipose tissues were obtained by surgery; lipids were
   extracted, saponified and esterified. TFA were measured by FTIR-ATR
   spectroscopy.
   Results: The TFA average in obese patients was 6.3\% for retroperitoneal
   and 8.7\% for visceral fat. For non-obese patients, the figures were
   6.9\% (subcutaneous) and 9.3\% (visceral). There was no difference
   between the groups. However, the TFA depot in visceral fat was higher
   than other fatty tissues for morbidly obese (P < 0.001) and non-obese (P
   < 0.05) patients.
   Conclusions: Our values for TFA content in all adipose tissues analyzed
   are higher than reported in other countries (3-6\%). We showed more TFA
   in visceral adipose tissue than in other abdominal fat (subcutaneous and
   retroperitoneal) stores. The visceral adipose tissue level is worrisome
   because the higher rate of lipolysis in this tissue appears to be an
   important indicator of metabolic alterations and the levels of TFA found
   in adipose tissue presumably reflect the higher dietary intake of TFA by
   Brazilians.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of pro-coagulant and anticoagulant components of the
   placental vascular endothelium and syncytiotrophoblast are essential for
   homeostasis. Vascular endothelium prevents blood clot formation in vivo
   by involving a cell surface thrombin-binding glycoprotein,
   thrombomodulin (TM), that activates plasma anti-coagulant protein C. The
   TM levels increase during pregnancy, but the fibrinolytic capacity
   diminishes. Since vascular lesions with placental coagulation disorders
   can be associated with preeclampsia (PE), we hypothesized that TM
   expression in the stem villous vasculature and syncytiotrophoblast of
   the placenta are impaired in PE. Plasma and placental tissue samples
   were collected from PE (n=12) and normotensive pregnant patients (n=11).
   Patient's gestational age was 35.7 +/- 1.2 (normotensive) and 30.6 +/-
   1.5 weeks (PE). Blood samples were drawn 30 min before delivery. Serum
   PAI-1 and PAI-2 antigens were determined by enzyme-linked
   immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). A monoclonal antibody specific for TM was
   used for immunohistochemical tissue staining (ABC) and the staining was
   quantified by semi quantitative scores. Results show no intensity
   differences at the apical syncytiotrophoblast between the two groups.
   However, in preeclamptic placenta, TM expression diminished in the
   endothelium of the stem villi arteries and increased in the perivascular
   and stromal myofibroblats in cases of severe PE. TM changes were
   associated with an increased PAI-1/PAI-2 ratio.
   It is suggested that in severe PE, the decreased placental blood flow
   may be due to structural and functional impairment of the endothelium of
   the stem villi vessels and the surrounding perivascular and stromal
   myofibroblast, by increasing TM expression which may modulate fetal blow
   flow in the villous tree.}},

Abstract = {{Newborn metabolic screening represents the largest application of

Abstract = {{Background: Hypertension is a common disease in patients with chronic
   kidney disease (CKD) and predisposes to heart disease, stroke, and
   progression of renal failure. In the general population, sodium
   restriction has been shown to improve blood pressure (BP) control, but
   this is not widely recommended in CKD patients. The aim of this study
   was to assess the sodium balance in a CKD clinic and its effect on BP
   management.
   Methods: We retrospectively reviewed charts from June 1998 through to
   June 2003 and included all patients with an estimated glomerular
   filtration rate (GFR) of < 30 mL/min who completed a 24-h urine
   collection for sodium. Patients were divided into tertiles based upon
   their 24-h sodium excretion and analyzed by ANOVA.
   Results: We included 141 CKD patients who had a mean (+/- SE) sodium
   excretion of 145.7 +/- 4.7 mmol/day. There were a significantly greater
   number of antihypertensive agents used with increasing sodium excretion
   (2.00 0.16, 2.61 +/- 0.20, and 2.77 +/- 0.19 medications, respectively
   for each fertile; P = .01). This difference was even more prominent when
   only those patients with a GFR <= 15 mL/min (n = 77) were examined (1.69
   +/- 0.19, 2.52 +/- 0.27, and 3.08 +/- 0.26 medications, respectively; P
   = .001). Control of BP was equivalent in all groups. Multivariable
   analysis revealed sodium excretion (P = .00005) and age (P = .007) to be
   significantly associated with use of antihypertensive medication.
   Conclusions: We have demonstrated that increased sodium intake is
   associated with an increased number of antihypertensive medications to
   achieve comparable BP control in a population with CKD.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MARKETING}},

Volume = {{69}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this preface is to describe how the special section on
   customer relationship management (CRM) was developed. In May 2003,
   Richard Staelin, Executive Director of the Teradata Center for Customer
   Relationship Management at Duke University, proposed that Journal of
   Marketing (JM) publish a special section. The proposal included
   activities that were designed to promote interactions among marketing
   academics and practitioners; the goal was to stimulate dialogue and new
   research on CRM. I found the proposal attractive because CRM is a
   broad-based topic that interests many marketers. After extensive
   discussion, the American Marketing Association (AMA) and the Teradata
   Center formally agreed to cosponsor the special section. Subsequently,
   there was a conference on Relationship Marketing and Customer
   Relationship Management (cochaired by Michael Ehret, Wesley Johnston,
   Michael Kleinaltenkamp, and Lou Pelton) that took place at Freie
   Universitat Berlin in the summer of 2003;1 a conference on Customer
   Management (cosponsored by the Marketing Science Institute and the
   Teradata Center) that was held at Duke University in March 2004; and two
   special sessions on CRM that were featured at the AMA Winter Educators'
   Conference held in San Antonio, Tex., in February 2005. The conferences
   provided many opportunities for dialogue, and the response from
   marketers who attended these events was enthusiastic. I also invited
   Richard Staelin and William Boulding (Executive Codirector of the
   Teradata Center) to work with me as consulting editors for the special
   section, and they agreed. A call for papers requested that authors
   submit their manuscripts to JM by May 2004. The consulting editors and I
   evaluated every submission with the assistance of an expert panel that
   included Leonard Berry, John Deighton, Michael Ehret, Christian
   Gronroos, Sunil Gupta, Wayne Hoyer, Wagner Kamakura, Wesley Johnston,
   Donald R. Lehmann, Charlotte Mason, Carl Mela, Scott Neslin, Roland
   Rust, Michel Wedel, and Valarie Zeithaml. All submissions underwent JM's
   standard double-blind review process, and members of JM's editorial
   review board served as reviewers. I would like to express my
   appreciation to everyone who participated in the development of the
   special section. The culmination of our work together is a set of nine
   articles and two essays that advance the science and practice of CRM. I
   hope that these articles stimulate new intellectual discoveries.}},

Abstract = {{After two decades in which closer integration into the world economy was
   presented as a shortcut to economic development, domestic policies have
   returned to be regarded as a key ingredient once again. This view is not
   new in Latin American academic and professional circles, but it has now
   become ``commonsense{''} in the ``anglo-saxon ``academic world as well,
   This ``change of mind{''} is welcome, although it may be just a moment
   in the cycle of ``pendular ideas{''} that characterize economic
   development literature and thinking. Behind these cycles lay perdurable
   ideas, institutions and interests. This article is organized in four
   sections. The first section presents globalization as a double-edged
   phenomenon that combines market and political considerations. The second
   section argues, in contrast to the view predominant in the 1990s, that
   national policies are a key determinant of the impact of globalization
   on economic performance. The third section reviews the role of ideas,
   institutions and interests in the construction of a set of policy
   recommendations that became a ready-made recipe for economic
   development. Finally, the fourth section emphasizes the role of domestic
   policies and local capacities to foster economic development and take
   stock of the potential opportunities opened by globalization. In
   particular, we point out at the need to attack market failures through
   targeted public policies, prevent the development of pernicious
   macroeconomic imbalances and increase the capacities and effectiveness
   of public sector institutions.}},

Abstract = {{Visual pigments, oil droplets and photoreceptor types in the retinas of
   four species of true chameleons have been examined by
   microspectrophotometry. The species occupy different photic
   environments: two species of Chamaeleo are from Madagascar and two
   species of Furcifer are from Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. In
   addition to double cones, four spectrally distinct classes of single
   cone were identified. No rod photoreceptors were observed. The visual
   pigments appear to be mixtures of rhodopsins and porphyropsins. Double
   cones contained a pale oil droplet in the principle member and both
   outer segments contained a long-wave-sensitive visual pigment with a
   spectral maximum between about 555 nm and 610 nm, depending on the
   rhodopsin/porphyropsin mixture. Long-wave-sensitive single cones
   contained a visual pigment spectrally identical to the double cones, but
   combined with a yellow oil droplet. The other three classes of single
   cone contained visual pigments with maxima at about 480-505, 440-450 and
   375-385 nm, combined with yellow, clear and transparent oil droplets
   respectively. The latter two classes were sparsely distributed. The
   transmission of the lens and cornea of C. dilepis was measured and found
   to be transparent throughout the visible and near ultraviolet, with a
   cut off at about 350 nm.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To describe a region of hyperechoic white matter adjacent to
   the atrium of the lateral ventricle of preterms, and to speculate on the
   relevance of detecting preterm white matter injury. Patients and
   methods: Cranial ultrasound images of 92 preterms of gestational age
   (GA) 32 wk or less were reviewed. For each infant, one first week
   standard coronal image was used for measurement of grey values around
   the para-atrial region of interest (PAROI) relative to the choroid
   plexus. For verification of the sonographic anatomy, MR images of an
   adult brain were used. For reference, neuro-anatomical images were
   compared in several atlases. In a group of nine preterms of similar GA
   with cystic periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) or MR-confirmed white
   matter disease, the disappearance of the PAROI was examined. Results:
   The hyperechoic para-atrial area, subjectively detected in 84\% of the
   patients, was situated bilaterally between the inner end of the lateral
   fissure and the upper third of the choroid plexus. In white matter
   caudal to the atrium, the hyperechoic band could be pursued towards the
   calcarine area. The average ratio of grey value around the PAROI to the
   choroid plexus was 0.787 (SD=0.072, median 0.791). There was no
   correlation between PAROI grey value and gestational age. At 26 wk
   gestational age, the average ratio was 0.781 (n=14), and 0.789 (n=17) at
   31 wk. Location of the PAROI agrees with the angle of the upper loop of
   the optic radiation. None of the nine infants with white matter damage
   had PAROIs clearly distinguishable from flaring.
   Conclusion: The symmetrical and unchanged acoustic character between 26
   and 31 wk of gestational age argues in favour of the hypothesis that the
   PAROI is an anatomical structure. The localization of the hyperechoic
   band supports the hypothesis that it represents part of the optic
   radiation. Further study is needed to examine the absence of a
   hyperechoic para-atrial band as a prognostic marker of the extension and
   severity of white matter injury.}},

Abstract = {{Two sources of asymmetric information in health markets are adverse
   selection where only individuals know their illness probability and
   their preventive effort to reduce illness probabilities. This effort is
   not observed by insurers, and thus individuals cannot be adequately
   compensated for their effort. I investigate whether asymmetric
   information plays a role in health care markets through a
   semi-parametric model that allows both adverse selection and preventive
   effort. I find that preventive effort plays a role in illness
   probabilities. If the United States implements universal health
   coverage, the currently uninsured population will exert less preventive
   effort, and their illness probabilities will increase.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The goal of this study was to analyze the transition period
   between interictal and ictal activity in freely moving rats with
   recurrent spontaneous seizures after unilateral intrahippocampal kainic
   acid (KA) injection.
   Methods: Pairs of tungsten electrodes (50 mu m O/D) were implanted
   bilaterally under anesthesia at symmetrical points in the dentate gyrus
   (DG) and CA1 regions of anterior and posterior hippocampi and entorhinal
   cortex of adult Wistar rats. Stimulating electrodes were placed in the
   right angular bundle and KA was injected into the right posterior CA3
   area of hippocampus after 1 week of baseline EEG recording. Beginning 24
   h after injection, electrographic activity was recorded with video
   monitoring for seizures every day for 8 h/day for 60 days.
   Results: Seventy percent of seizures started locally in the DG
   ipsilateral to injection, with an increase in frequency of interictal
   EEG spikes (hypersynchronous type, HYP), and 26\% of seizures started
   with a decrease of EEG amplitude with parallel increase in frequency
   (low-voltage fast type, LVF). During HYP seizures, a significant
   increase was observed in amplitude of beta-gamma range frequencies,
   ripple frequency, and fast ripple (FR) frequency, whereas during LVF
   seizure, an increase was noted only in the beta-gamma range. In all
   cases but one, an EEG wave preceded ripple and FR oscillations. Before
   seizure onset, the amplitude of DG-evoked responses to single pulses
   decreased, whereas the amplitude of the response to the second pulse
   delivered at 30-ms interval increased.
   Conclusions: If ripple and FR oscillations indicate the
   seizure-generating neuronal substrate, these areas must be small and
   widespread, so that the probability of recording from them directly is
   very low. The decreased response to electrical stimulation before
   seizures could indicate a protective inhibitory mechanism that contains
   or prevents seizure occurrence. The presence of decreased paired-pulse
   suppression could indicate a network predisposition to follow an
   external input with a certain frequency.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the ideas and developments of the project EP-CACHE.
   Within this project new methods and tools are developed to improve the
   analysis and the optimization of programs for cache architectures,
   especially for SMP clusters. The tool set comprises the semi-automatic
   instrumentation of user programs, the monitoring of the cache behavior,
   the visualization of the measured data, and optimization techniques for
   improving the user program for better cache usage.
   As current hardware performance counters do not give sufficient user
   relevant information, new hardware monitors are designed that provide
   more detailed information about the cache utilization related to the
   data structures and code blocks in the user program. The expense of the
   hardware and software realization will be assessed to minimize the risk
   of a real implementation of the investigated monitors. The usefulness of
   the hardware monitors is evaluated by a cache simulator. (c) 2004

Abstract = {{Grassland fires have been shown to influence grasshopper community

   of three grasshopper subfamilies in western North Dakota northern
   mixed-grass prairie with sampling in paired burned and unburned plots. A
   rapidly moving fire occurred in late October 1999, after
   egg-overwintering grasshoppers had died. Vegetation biomass and nitrogen
   content of grasses did not differ statistically between burned and
   unburned plots in 2000. The fire negatively affected grasshopper
   population densities the year after the fire, but species diversity was
   not affected by the fire. Much of the reduction in grasshopper
   population densities was caused by a decline in densities of
   Gomphocerinae species. Grasshopper subfamily densities did not differ
   statistically between burned and unburned plots in 2001. Additional
   research is needed to determine the mechanisms leading to the reduction
   in Gomphocerinae species densities.}},

Abstract = {{Sonography of the neck and superior mediastinum is a very instructive
   method of investigation. However, the topographical anatomy of the
   region makes major demands on the investigator. In many diseases in this
   area, ultrasonography may be used as the first and also only imaging
   method (thyroid, salivary glands, lymph nodes). Pathological findings
   are detected with high sensitivity. The dynamic investigation with
   palpation, compression and observation of deglutition is especially
   helpful in appraising the consistency, displace-ability and
   topographical identification of structures. The specificity can be
   substantially improved by use of color Doppler sonography and
   ultrasound-guided biopsy. The pharyngeal and retropharyngeal space, the
   base of the brain and the posterior mediastinum are difficult to access
   by sonography. The investigator must therefore arrange for supplementary
   imaging procedures such as CT, MRI or thyroid scintigraphy in unclear
   cases, e.g. in diagnosis and staging of tumors. Mediastinal space
   occupations are most frequent in the anterior upper mediastinum. They
   can be appraised almost as reliably by transthoracic sonography as by

Abstract = {{A recently developed whole of surface electroplating technique was used
   to obtain mass-transfer rates in the separated flow region of a stepped
   rotating cylinder electrode. These data are compared with previously
   reported mass-transfer rates obtained with a patch electrode. It was
   found that the two methods yield different results, where at lower
   Reynolds numbers, the mass-transfer rate enhancement was noticeably
   higher for the whole of the surface electrode than for the patch
   electrode. The location of the peak mass transfer behind the step, as
   measured with a patch electrode, was reported to be independent of the
   Reynolds number in previous studies, whereas the whole of the surface
   electrode shows a definite Reynolds number dependence. Large eddy
   simulation results for the recirculating region behind a step are used
   in this work to show that this difference in behavior is related to the
   existence of a much thinner fluid layer at the wall for which the
   velocity is a linear junction of distance from the wall. Consequently,
   the diffusion layer no longer lies well within a laminar sublayer. It is
   concluded that the patch electrode responds to the wall shear stress for
   smooth wall flow as well as for the disturbed flow region behind the
   step. When the whole of the surface is electro-active, the response is
   to mass transfer even when this is not a sole function of wall shear
   stress. The results demonstrate that the choice of the mass-transfer
   measurement technique in corrosion studies can have a significant effect
   on the results obtained from empirical data.}},

Abstract = {{Whether consumption of cruciferous vegetables protects against lung
   cancer is unclear, largely because of potential confounding factors. We
   therefore studied the role of cruciferous vegetables in lung cancer
   after stratifying by GSTM1 and GSTT1 status, two genes implicated in the
   elimination of isothiocyanates, the likely chemopreventative compound.
   In 2141 cases and 2168 controls, weekly consumption of cruciferous
   vegetables protected against lung cancer in those who were GSTM1 null
   (odds ratio=0.67, 95\% CI 0.49-0.91), GSTT1 null (0.63, 0.37-1.07), or
   both (0.28, 0.11-0.67). No protective effect was seen in people who were
   both GSTM1 and GSTT1 positive (0.88, 0.65-1.21). Similar protective
   results were noted for consumption of cabbage and a combination of
   broccoli and brussels sprouts. These data provide strong evidence for a

Abstract = {{We present a detailed discussion of the relaxation of splayed states in
   untwisted devices - the asymmetric H state ( Ha), and the recently
   observed symmetric H state (Hs). Experimental evidence suggests that the
   Hs does not experience the optical bounce due to induced backflow
   usually associated with splay state relaxation. A dynamic model using
   Leslie-Eriksen-Parodi theory has been developed, and is used to model
   the flow within the device during switching. We show that there is no
   backflow during Hs relaxation, and that the flow profile is similar to
   that present during relaxation of the V state (the state used for
   pi-cell operation). This flow enhances the switching of the Hs, leading
   to a faster relaxation than might be expected. The influence of the
   different viscosity parameters is examined in detail, and a comparison
   between the experimental and simulated results is given.}},

Abstract = {{This article seeks to identify the major issues in the management of
   music manuscripts within the UK. With knowledge of current practice
   gained through the investigation of five case study repositories, from
   both archive and library domains, aspects Of management are explored and
   considered within an archival context. Three major aspects of management
   are identified-collecting (collecting policies, storage and
   preservation), describing (finding aids, standards) and providing
   (access, outreach)-and each of the five case studies is tailored to fit
   these key areas. Exploration of these issues facilitates the ultimate
   aim of producing an approach to better, more consistent methods in this
   neglected area. Suggestions for improvement include the development of
   specific standards or guidelines for preservation and description, and
   the establishment of a specialist, cross-domain working group, prompting
   formal networking between the music library professional body, the
   International Association of Music Libraries, and representatives from
   other domains. The continued development of collaborative music
   resources such as Cecilia is also found to be key to the unified
   provision of user access.}},

Pages = {{101-108}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{There are many measurement tools for assessing patients' shoulder
   symptoms (pain) and function (what patients can do), but they do not
   measure activity (how often a patient engages in activity). This is
   relevant because activity level can have an important impact on a
   patient's outcome. Our goal was to develop a short, easy to administer
   measure of shoulder activity which could be used to predict outcome of
   shoulder disorders. The activity scale was developed using established
   principles: item generation, item reduction, pretesting, and reliability
   and validity testing. The activity rating is a numerical sum of scores
   for five activities rated on a five-point frequency scale from never
   performed (0 points) to daily (4 points). Patients were scored on the
   following criteria: carrying an object 8 lb or heavier by hand, handling
   objects overhead, weight training with arms, swinging motion (ie,
   hitting tennis or golf ball), and lifting objects 25 lb or heavier. Two
   additional multiple choice questions provide a score assessing
   participation in contact and overhead sports. The activity scale showed
   excellent reliability and construct validity. It can be completed
   quickly and used in conjunction with patient-based measures of shoulder
   outcome to define patient populations for cohort studies, and to assess
   activity level as a prognostic factor in patients with shoulder
   disorders.}},

Abstract = {{By a result of Gallai, every finite graph G has a vertex partition into
   two parts each inducing an element of its cycle space. This falls for
   infinite graphs if, as usual, the cycle space is defined as the span of
   the edge sets of finite cycles in G. However, we show that, for the
   adaptation of the cycle space to infinite graphs recently introduced by
   Diestel and Kohn (which involves infinite cycles as well as finite
   ones), Gallai's theorem extends to locally finite graphs. Using similar
   techniques, we show that if Seymour's faithful cycle cover conjecture is
   true for finite graphs then it also holds for locally finite graphs when
   infinite cyles are allowed in the cover, but not otherwise. We also
   consider extensions to graphs with infinite degrees. (c) 2005 Wiley

Abstract = {{Contrary to the situation in ``classical{''} clinical pharmacology,
   non-steady state phenomena play a fundamental role for clinical
   pharmacology in anesthesia. Their understanding is of tantamount
   importance for the safe and efficient application of drugs relevant to
   anesthesia. Concepts like optimised target-controlled infusion (TCI),
   effect compartment targeting and the small margin of error tolerable
   during maintained spontaneous ventilation, force the anesthesiologist to
   acquire a firm understanding of the difference between the concentration
   time course at the effect side vs. time course of the plasma
   concentration. The underlying concepts, their application for the
   rational use of muscle relaxants, propofol with TO systems, volatile
   anaesthetics and opioids will be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The age and spatial structure of six natural old growth Pinus sylvestris
   stands in Latvia were investigated, to attempt to identify
   retrospectively the past features of development. In each stand, one or
   two plots of size 200 - 900 m(2) were established. Tree locations were
   mapped, stem diameter was measured, and tree age was determined from
   cores or by counting branch whorls. Tree distribution was assessed by
   Ripley's K function. A clumped spatial pattern was shown for P.
   sylvestris younger than 100 years. The temporal patterns of
   establishment could be partly linked to favourable climatic periods. The
   major disturbance affecting pine stands along the coast was windblown
   sand, which partly buried some stems and probably affected the patterns
   of seedling recruitment and mortality. Disturbance caused by fire had a
   major role in determining the past regimens of mortality and
   establishment in dry stands located inland. The successful invasion
   during the last century of spruce in more mesic plots with a pine
   overstorey may be due to fire suppression.}},

Abstract = {{We report experiments on control of thermocapillary instabilities at

   {[}Phys. Fluids 14, 3039 (2002)] showed that a reasonable control of
   oscillatory instability could be achieved by optimizing a local heating
   feedback process. We conducted experiments with a basic flow converging
   from periphery to center. This constitutes a more unstable configuration
   than previously, and enables appearance of higher-order instabilities
   and chaos. Applying successfully local feedback control to the periodic
   state close to the threshold, we extend the process to higher
   temperature differences, where nonlinear as well as
   proportional/derivative control laws are necessary to obtain a
   significant decrease of the temperature fluctuations. Finally,
   proportional control allows us to synchronize a chaotic state, to a
   periodic one. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics.}},

   analysis of ATCV revealed that the viral capsid has a distinct
   icosahedral shape with a diameter of 140-190 nm. Filamentous structures
   extending from some of the virus vertices, which may aid attachment of
   the virus to host cells, were also observed. The capsid is made up of
   one major coat protein of about 50 kDa and contains a large dsDNA
   genome. ATCV is a member of the genus Chlorovirus, which belongs to the
   family Phycodnaviridae, a group of large, icosahedral, dsDNA-containing
   viruses that infect algae and are ubiquitous in natural environments.
   However, ATCV is clearly distinct from the prototype Chlorovirus,
   Paramecium bursaria Chlorella virus (PBCV-1), in some aspects of its
   genome structure and gene content and therefore must be regarded as a
   member of a new group of Chlorella viruses.}},

Abstract = {{Visual impairment is an important risk factor for falls, but relatively
   little is known about how it affects stair negotiation. The present
   study determined how medio-lateral (ML) dynamics of stepping and single
   limb support stability when stepping up or down to a new level were
   affected by blurring the vision of healthy elderly subjects. Twelve
   elderly subjects (72.3 +/- 4.2 years) were analysed performing single
   steps up and single steps down to a new level (7.2, 14.4 and 21.6 cm).
   Stepping dynamics were assessed by deter-mining the ML ground reaction
   force (GRF) impulse, lateral position of the centre of mass (CM)
   relative to the supporting foot (average horizontal ML distance between
   CM and CP during single support) and movement time. Stability was
   determined as the rms fluctuation in ML position of the centre of
   pressure (CP) during single support. Differences between optimal and
   blurred visual conditions were analysed using a random effects model.
   Duration of double and single support, and the ML GRF impulse were
   significantly greater when vision was blurred, while the average CM - CP
   ML distance and ML stability was reduced. ML stability decreased with
   increasing step height and was further decreased when stepping down than
   when stepping up. These findings indicate that ML balance during
   stepping up and down was significantly affected by blurring vision. In
   particular, single limb support stability was considerably reduced,
   especially so during stepping down. The findings highlight the
   importance of accurate visual feedback in the precise control of
   stepping dynamics when stepping up or down to a new level, and suggest
   that correcting common visual problems, such as uncorrected refractive
   errors and cataract may be an important intervention strategy in
   improving how the elderly negotiate stairs. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{An abscission agent {[}5-chloro-3-methyl-4-nitro-1H-pyrazole (CMNP)] was
   applied to `Hamlin' and `Valencia' orange (Citrus sinensis) trees at
   concentrations ranging from 0 to 500 ppm in a volume of 300 gal/acre.
   Four days after application, fruit were mechanically harvested with
   either a trunk shake-and-catch or a continuous canopy shake-and-catch
   system commercially used in Florida. Harvesting conditions were varied
   by limiting the actual trunk shake time of the trunk shaker to 2, 4, or
   7 seconds, or by altering the ground speed of the canopy shaker (1.0,
   1.5, or 2.0 mph). In general, increasing duration of shake and the
   application of CMNP increased percent mature fruit removal and decreased
   the amount of fruit remaining in the tree. Increasing CMNP concentration
   decreased fruit detachment force but increased post-spray fruit drop.
   Comparison of short duration shake times in CMNP-applied trees with
   trees harvested at longer durations either sprayed or not sprayed with
   CMNP indicated no significant difference in percent mature fruit
   removal. The results demonstrate that CMNP application increases
   harvesting capacity of trunk and canopy shakers by reducing time
   necessary to harvest each tree while maintaining high percent mature
   fruit removal.}},

Abstract = {{Background/aim: Trachomatous trichiasis frequently returns following
   surgery. Several factors may promote recurrence: preoperative disease
   severity, surgeon ability, surgical procedure, healing responses, and
   infection. This study investigates whether enhanced control of
   infection, both of Chlamydia trachomatis and other bacteria, with
   azithromycin can improve surgical outcome in a trachoma control
   programme.
   Methods: Individuals with trachomatous trichiasis were examined and
   operated. After surgery patients were randomised to the azithromycin or
   control group. The azithromycin group and children in their household
   were given a dose of azithromycin. Antibiotic treatment was repeated at
   6 months. All patients were reassessed at 6 months and 12 months.
   Samples were collected for C trachomatis polymerase chain reaction and
   general microbiology at each examination.
   Results: 451 patients were enrolled. 426 (94\%) were reassessed at 1
   year, of whom 176 (41.3\%) had one or more lashes touching the eye and
   84 (19.7\%) had five or more lashes. There was no difference in
   trichiasis recurrence between the azithromycin and control group.
   Recurrent trichiasis was significantly associated with more severe
   preoperative trichiasis, bacterial infection, and severe conjunctival
   inflammation at 12 months. Significant variability in outcome was found
   between surgeons. Visual acuity and symptoms significantly improved
   following surgery.
   Conclusion: In this setting, with a low prevalence of active trachoma,
   azithromycin did not improve the outcome of trichiasis surgery conducted
   by a trachoma control programme. Audit of trichiasis surgery should be
   routine.}},

Abstract = {{Does the geographic concentration of industry `matter' outside the

   probably not the case in countries where the electorate votes more as a

   have an advantage regardless of how the political map is drawn. We
   sharpen the terms of debate and weigh in with empirical evidence from a
   cross-sectional analysis of intended voter turnout in eight
   member-states of the European Union and a multi-year study of voter
   turnout in the Netherlands. These tests uniformly show that, across
   different types of electoral systems, including those in which voters
   vote as a national constituency, thereby removing any effects of
   electoral geography per se, workers in traded industries that are
   physically concentrated are, in fact, substantially more likely to vote

Abstract = {{How do international processes, actors and institutions contribute to

   in the fields of international relations and comparative politics have
   identified a wide array of convergence mechanisms operating at the

   array of possible causes of policy convergence, we propose a typology of
   three broad classes of mechanisms: (1) the co-operative harmonization of
   domestic practices by means of international legal agreements or
   supranational law; (2) the coercive imposition of political practices by
   means of economic, political or even military threat, intervention or
   conditionality; and (3) the interdependent but uncoordinated diffusion
   of practices by means of cross-national imitation, emulation or
   learning. We illustrate and substantiate this claim through the
   empirical analysis of the international spread of three different kinds
   of policy innovation: national environmental policy plans and
   sustainable development strategies, environmental ministries and
   agencies, and feed-in tariffs and quotas for the promotion of renewable

Abstract = {{Rising pharmaceutical expenditure has become a major concern for policy
   makers in Germany over recent years. Therefore, the pharmaceutical
   market has been increasingly targeted by different kinds of regulation,
   focussing on both the supply and the demand side, using price, volume
   and spending controls. Specific regulations include price reductions,
   reference pricing, pharmacy rebates for sickness funds, increasing
   co-payments, an `autidem' substitution, parallel imports, a negative
   list, directives, and finally, spending caps for pharmaceutical
   expenditure per physicians' association. Although it is difficult to
   attribute certain effects to single measures, some measures like
   reference pricing and physician spending caps are more effective and
   long-lasting than others. In spite of being opposed by physicians, the
   spending caps applied between 1993 and 2001 have limited pharmaceutical
   expenditure for an entire decade. However, while some measures do
   effectively control expenditures, their effect on allocative efficiency
   may be detrimental. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   Approximately two-thirds of the tested isolates were pathogenic to both
   cucumber and melon, but cumulatively they were more aggressive on
   cucumber, their major host, than on melon. Disease symptoms on melon
   plants were less destructive and often expressed as growth retardation.
   Melon cultivars differing in Fom genes for resistance to F. oxysporum f.
   sp. melonis were inoculated with three isolates of F. oxysporum f. sp.
   cucumerinum. Results showed that Fom genes do not confer resistance to
   F. oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum, although different horticultural types
   may respond differently to this pathogen. The reciprocal inoculation of
   F. oxysporum f. sp. melonis on cucumber, using four physiological races,

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{10}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: A hyperdense line on the ilium that runs roughly parallel to
   the sacroiliac joint (we called it ``iliac hyperdense line sign{''}) was
   frequently observed on pelvic radiographs of patients with gluteal
   muscle contracture (GMC). A literature search revealed no description of
   this sign. Objective: To determine the relationship between the iliac
   hyperdense line sign and GMC and to explore how this sign is formed.
   Materials and methods: Pelvic plain films of 103 cases of GMC and those
   of 200 control individuals were reviewed for the presence or absence of
   the iliac hyperdense line sign. Pelvic CT scans in 8 of 103 cases and 13
   of 200 controls were analyzed with relation to the plain films. Results:
   The iliac hyperdense line sign was visualized in 85 of 103 (82.5\%)
   cases of GMC and none of the 200 controls. In the GMC group, pelvic CT
   scans showed a deformity of the posterior ilium. The lateral cortex of
   the posterior ilium took on a partly or completely anteroposterior
   course, while in the control group the course appeared as an oblique
   orientation from posteromedial to anterolateral. Conclusion: The iliac
   hyperdense line on pelvic plain film can be used as a radiographic sign
   to suggest a diagnosis of GMC. This sign might be a result of the long
   and persistent pulling effect of the contracted gluteus maximus muscle,
   which deforms the lateral cortex of the posterior ilium from an oblique
   course to an anteroposterior course tangential to the X-ray beam.}},

   (branch sensitivity factor), our algorithm manages to reduce the skew
   sensitivity of the clock tree in the topology generation. The worst case
   skew due to the wire width change has been estimated, and proper buffers
   are inserted to avoid large capacitance load. Experimental results show
   that our algorithm can produce a more reliable, process-insensitive
   clock tree, and control clock skews in their permissible range

Abstract = {{Studies were carried out for selective leaching of Cu with simultaneous
   avoidance of iron dissolution during leaching of oxidized copper ore in
   an aqueous NH3(NH4)(2)SO4 system. The effects of leaching parameters,
   such as ammonia concentration, ammonium sulphate concentration, leaching
   time, and solid-to-liquid ratio, were investigated on leaching of
   copper. A 2(n) factorial experimental design method in the dissolution
   experiments was used. In addition, the ``Steepest Ascent{''} method was
   also applied to determine the optimum leaching conditions. It was
   observed that the most effective parameters on the leaching of copper
   were ammonia concentration and leaching time. Only 0.17\% of iron in ore
   was dissolved in ammonia and ammonium sulphate medium. The optimum
   conditions established for maximum copper recovery were: ammonia
   concentration 2.824 mol L-1, ammonium sulphate concentration 0.236 mol
   L-1, solid-to-liquid ratio 0.167 g mL(-1), leaching time 2 h. Fixed
   parameters chosen in the experiments were: room temperature, average
   particle size 2.8 mm, stirring speed 500 rpm. Under the optimum
   conditions established for maximum copper recovery, the percentage of
   leached copper was 98.87.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we explore the boundary between calculative and
   noncalculative action by arguing that these are separate but mutually
   constitutive. By using the notion of qualculation, a neologism coined by
   Cochoy, we redefine the notion of calculation to include judgment. We
   then argue that making qualculability is not trivial: that it takes
   effort to create calculation and judgment. But it also takes effort to
   consider nonqualculability. Two strategies for achieving
   nonqualculability are identified, those of rarefaction and
   proliferation. Rarefaction, illustrated by the cases of Quaker worship
   and selfless love or agape, works by withdrawing all qualculative
   resources. Conversely, proliferation, illustrated by the attribution of
   cause and responsibility after railway accidents, and by a major
   television fund-raiser, the `Telethon', works to impede calculation by
   an overload of qualculative resources.}},

Abstract = {{Context: Leptin is a nutritionally regulated adipocyte-derived cytokine.
   Previous studies in obese patients have demonstrated increased
   inflammatory markers and increased platelet aggregation in association
   with leptin. However, the effects of leptin administration on markers of
   inflammation and platelet aggregation in a human model of undernutrition
   have not previously been studied.
   Objective: The objective of the study was to investigate markers of
   inflammation, platelet activation, and platelet aggregation in a model
   of caloric deprivation and increased leptin sensitivity. Design: This
   study was a randomized, placebo-controlled study conducted between
   November 2002 and November 2003.
   Setting: The study was conducted at an inpatient care setting at the
   General Clinical Research Center.
   Participants: Twenty healthy, young (18-35 yr old), normal-weight ( body
   mass index, 20-26 kg/m(2)) women were recruited from local
   advertisements. No subjects withdrew due to adverse effects.
   Intervention: The effects of physiological recombinant methionyl human
   leptin or identical placebo administration were investigated over a 4-d
   fast.
   Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measures for this study were
   C-reactive protein (CRP) and indices of platelet activity.
   Results: Leptin administration prevented the fasting-induced decline in
   leptin (P < 0.05 vs. placebo at each time point). Leptin administration
   increased CRP (6.3 +/- 2.4 vs. 0.7 +/- 0.3 mg/ liter; P = 0.04),
   circulating P-selectin (11.6 +/- 10.2 vs. -28.9 +/- 15.6 ng/ml; P =
   0.04), and induction of platelet aggregation (5.8 +/- 2.6 vs. -2.7 +/-
   2.9\%, P = 0.04, percent maximum plat elet aggregation) relative to
   placebo administration ( change in leptin vs. change in placebo,
   respectively, for each variable). Leptin tended to increase serum
   amyloid A {[}0.1 +/- 10.2 vs. -0.3 +/- 0.1 log(10) (ng/ml); P = 0.07],
   and the changes in serum amyloid A and CRP were highly correlated (r =
   0.83; P < 0.0001). No changes in TNF alpha, IL-6, IL-10, plasminogen
   activator inhibitor-1, haptoglobin, intercellular adhesion molecule, or
   vascular cell adhesion molecule were seen between the groups.
   Conclusions: Our data provide evidence that physiological leptin
   administration stimulates inflammatory and platelet responses in humans
   during caloric deprivation.}},

   present when a single-mode laser is employed. Second, there is a

Abstract = {{Lipid peroxidation during oxidative stress leads to increased
   concentrations of thiol-reactive alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde,
   including 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4- HNE) and 4-oxo-2-nonenal (4-ONE).
   These aldehydes have a documented ability to disrupt protein function
   following adduct formation with specific residues. Therefore, to
   identify 4-HNE-modified proteins in a model of ethanol-induced oxidative
   stress, a proteomic approach was applied to liver fractions prepared
   from rats fed a combination high-fat/ethanol diet. The results revealed
   that essential 90-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) was consistently
   modified by 4-HNE in the alcohol-treated animals. In vitro chaperoning
   experiments using firefly luciferase as a client protein were then
   performed to assess the functional effect of 4-HNE modification on
   purified recombinant human Hsp90, modified with concentrations of this
   aldehyde ranging from 23 to 450 mu M. Modification of Hsp90 with 4-ONE
   also led to significant inhibition of the chaperone. Because 4-HNE and
   4-ONE react selectively with Cys, a thiol-specific mechanism of
   inhibition was suggested by these data. Therefore, thiol sensitivity was
   confirmed following treatment of Hsp90 with the specific thiol modifier
   N-ethylmaleimide, which resulted in more than 99\% inactivation of the
   chaperone by concentrations as low as 6 mu M (1:1 M ratio). Finally,
   tryptic digest of 4-HNE- modified Hsp90 followed by liquid
   chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry peptide analysis identified Cys
   572 as a site for 4-HNE modification. The results presented here thus
   establish that 4-HNE consistently modifies Hsp90 in a rat model of
   alcohol-induced oxidative stress and that the chaperoning activity of
   this protein is subject to dysregulation through thiol modification.}},

Abstract = {{The time evolution of the radiation pressure forces due to the action of
   laser light on matter in the form of neutral molecules, atoms, and ions
   is considered when the frequency of the light is comparable to a
   dipole-allowed transition frequency. We find that the transient regime,
   applicable from the instant the laser is switched on, is important for
   the gross motion, provided that the upper-state lifetime Gamma(-1) is
   relatively long, while the steady-state regime, formally such that t
   >Gamma(-1), is appropriate for the evaluation of the forces and the
   dynamics for large Gamma. With a focus on the
   orbital-angular-momentum-endowed laser light, the light-induced
   time-dependent forces and torques are determined and their full time
   dependence utilized to determine trajectories. Marked differences are
   found in both translational and rotational features in comparison with
   the results emerging when the steady-state forces are assumed from the
   outset. Intricate and detailed atom trajectories are plotted for
   Laguerre-Gaussian light at near resonance for a transition of Eu3+ that
   has a particularly small Gamma. The implications of the results for
   trapping and manipulating atoms and ions using laser light are pointed
   out and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have suggested that the familiarity of a face leads to
   more robust recognition, at least within the visual domain. The aim of
   our study was to investigate whether face familiarity resulted in a
   representation of faces that was easily shared across the sensory
   modalities. In Experiment 1, we tested whether haptic recognition of a
   highly familiar face (one's own face) was as efficient as visual
   recognition. Our observers were unable to recognise their own face
   models from tactile memory alone but were able to recognise their faces
   visually. However, haptic recognition improved when participants were
   primed by their own live face. In Experiment 2, we found that short-term
   familiarisation with a set of previously unfamiliar face stimuli
   improved crossmodal recognition relative to the recognition of
   unfamiliar faces. Our findings suggest that familiarisation provides a
   strong representation of faces but that the nature of the information
   encoded during learning is critical for efficient crossmodal
   recognition.}},

   higher than in plasma. The following pharmacokinetic parameters were
   obtained for lamotrigine 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg, respectively: clearance of
   distribution from plasma to brain normalized with the volume of the
   brain, CLIV(h(-1)) = 4.64, 2.47, 2.40; brain-to-plasma partition
   coefficient, P = 0.40. 0.37, 0.34;.first-order transfer rate constant
   from the brain to the plasma, K(h(-1)) = 11.68, 6.68, 5.96; single-pass
   mean transit time in the brain, MTT(h) = 0.086, 0.150, 0.168. These
   results indicate that lamotrigine plasma levels may be good indicators
   of lamotrigine levels in the brain and that higher response intensities
   could be expected with hixgher doses of lamotrigine, since efficacious
   concentrations are maintained for a longer period.}},

   specific impairment in autism in recognizing the belief-based expression
   of surprise, (2) previous data showing specific impairment in autism in
   recognizing fear, and (3) the convergence of findings that individuals
   with autism, like patients with amygdala damage, pass a basic emotions

Abstract = {{In recent years, an increase in ocular pathologies related to soft
   contact lens has been observed. The most common infectious agents were
   Staphylococcus spp. Some strains produce an extracellular
   polysaccharidic slime that can cause severe infections. Polysaccharide
   synthesis is under genetic control and involves a specific intercellular
   adhesion (ica) locus, in particular, icaA and icaD genes. Conjunctival
   swabs from 97 patients with presumably bacterial bilateral
   conjunctivitis, wearers of soft contact lenses were examined. We
   determined the ability of staphylococci to produce slime, relating it to
   the presence of icaA and icaD genes. We also investigated the antibiotic
   susceptibility and Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns of
   the clinical isolates. We found that 74.1\% of the S. epidermidis
   strains and 61.1\% of the S. aureus strains isolated were slime
   producers and showed icaA and icaD genes.
   Both S. epidermidis and S. aureus slime-producing strains exhibited more
   surface hydrophobicity than non-producing slime strains. The PFGE
   patterns overlapped in S. epidermidis strains with high hydrophobicity.
   The similar PFGE patterns were not related to biofilm production. We
   found scarce matching among the Staphylococcus spp. studied, slime
   production, surface hydrophobicity and antibiotic susceptibility.}},

Abstract = {{The fungus Aspergillus terreus Thorn var. terreus isolated from an
   Ecuador soil sample was cultured in liquid and solid media and yielded
   three main metabolites identified as terreic acid (1), butyrolactone I
   (2) and lovastatin (3). The natural products as well as three synthetic
   butyrolactone I derivatives were assessed for antimicrobial activity
   against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi as well as
   for seed germination and seedling growth. Furthermore, the compounds
   were assessed as inhibitors towards the enzymes acetylcholinesterase,
   beta-glucosidase, and beta-glucuronidase. Terreic acid, butyrolactone I,
   butyrolactone 4',4''-diacetate (2.1), and
   3'-(3-methylbutyl)-butyrolactone II (2.2) were active towards the
   phytopathogenic bacteria Erwinia carotovora with IC50 of 5 and 4-18 mu
   g/ml, respectively. Under the same experimental conditions, the IC50 of
   streptomycin was 1.9 mu g/ml. 3'-(3-Methylbutyl)-butyrolactone II was
   moderately active against Pseudomonas syringae and Botrytis cinerea with
   IC50 of 21 mu g/ml and MIC of 15.6 mu g/ml, respectively. Butyrolactone
   I also inhibited germination of the dicot Lactuca sativa with an IC50 of
   5 x 10(-5) M. The IC50 of reference herbicide acetochlor was 1 x 10(-5)
   M. The effect of 2.2 and 2.3, known as butyrolactone III on Panicum
   millaceum germination and growth was stronger than that of 2 and 2.1.
   Reduction of the double bond in the isoprenyl side chain of
   butyrolactone I increased the antibacterial effect against E. carotovora
   as well as acetylation. To our best knowledge, this is the first report
   on the antibacterial effect of butyrolactone derivatives towards Erwinia
   carotovora and the phytopathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea. The
   butyrolactone I derivative 2.2 presented a moderate inhibitory effect
   against the enzyme acetylcholinesterase with an IC50 of 47 mu g/ml.
   Under the same experimental conditions, the reference inhibitor
   galanthamine had an IC50 of 3 mu g/ml.}},

   propose two models where new projection neurons are incorporated. We
   show that in both models, using incorporation and removal of neurons as
   a computational tool, it is possible to achieve a higher computational
   efficiency that in purely static, synapse-learning-driven networks. We

Abstract = {{Purpose: To assess the efficacy of intravitreal triamcinolone treatment
   for macular edema from central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) and
   hemiretinal vein occlusion (HRVO).
   Methods: This study was a retrospective medical records review of 24
   eyes of 24 patients (mean age, 71 years) that were injected with 4 mg of
   intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide for treatment of macular edema due
   to CRVO (n = 21) and HRVO (n = 3). Of the 24 eyes, 14 were injected
   once, 6 were injected twice, 3 were injected 3 times, and 1 received 4
   injections. Mean follow-up time was 10 months (range, 3-24 months). The
   average time between onset of symptoms and first injection was 5.4
   months (range, 2-48 months). Available documents on pre- and
   postinjection optical coherence tomography central foveal thickness in
   23 of 39 total injections were evaluated.
   Results: All injections resulted in reduction in central foveal
   thickness as determined by optical coherence tomography. The mean
   central foveal thickness decreased to 55\% of preinjection values ({[}n
   = 23] 635 vs. 352 mu m, respectively; P < 0.001). The average gain in
   visual acuity was 1.3 Snellen lines (range, -3-7) over the course of the
   study period. Ten eyes gained >= 2 lines of visual acuity, 3 eyes
   improved 1 line, 7 eyes remained the same, and 4 eyes worsened. There
   was no correlation between improvement in foveal thickness and
   corresponding visual gain (P = 0.24). None of the eyes of diabetic
   patients (n = 6) or patients with ischemic CRVO (n = 2) improved in
   visual acuity. The difference in mean baseline (20/167) and mean final
   visual acuity (20/91) was statistically significant (P = 0.015). The
   mean best postinjection visual acuity (20/67) was also significantly
   higher than the mean final visual acuity (P = 0.019). When diabetic and
   ischemic CRVO patients were excluded, the difference between mean
   baseline visual acuity and mean final visual acuity was found to be
   highly significant ({[}n = 16] 20/133 vs. 20/67, respectively; P <
   0.001), while mean final and best postinjection visual acuities (20/50)
   did not differ (P = 0.085). Eight of 16 phakic eyes showed progression
   of cataract, 2 of which underwent cataract extraction. Nine of 18
   patients without a history of glaucoma developed ocular hypertension and
   required glaucoma medication during postinjection follow-up.
   Trabeculectomy was performed on two eyes with glaucoma. Two other eyes
   developed epiretinal membranes, one of which underwent vitrectomy.
   Conclusions: Intravitreal triamcinolone may be effective in treating
   macular edema from CRVO and HRVO. Subjects with concurrent diabetes or
   ischemic central retinal vein were less likely to have visual
   improvement.}},

Abstract = {{In the Mediterranean area, the introduction of cover crops in vineyards
   is hampered by the risk of severe competition for water. Belowground
   interactions are still not very clear in this perennial-herbaceous
   association. This work was aimed at characterizing the development of
   the root systems of associated crops and the soil water dynamics. It
   also investigated whether water competition could be the cause of vine
   vigour and yield reductions. Experiments were conducted in a 4-year-old
   association (vine - tall fescue) and in a weed controlled vineyard.
   Water transfers in the soil were estimated on the basis of the soil
   water potential and soil hydrodynamic properties. The vine root system
   was concentrated in the soil under the row, whereas the intercrop highly
   colonized a soil compartment under the inter-row to a depth of
   approximately 1 m. Despite this spatial complementarity in root
   distribution, intercropping reduced the amount of soil water available
   for the vine crop. The low soil water content reduced soil water
   conductivity thereby limiting water transfers, despite a significant
   gradient in the soil water potential. This conductivity did not differ
   significantly between treatments but the intercrop enhanced the
   infiltration of winter rainwater, probably by limiting surface runoff.
   There was temporal complementarity in this association since the period
   of intense water uptake by the intercrop occurred earlier than noted for
   the vine under bare soil conditions. Nevertheless, the competition for
   water was limited by better refilling of the soil water profile during
   winter in the intercropped treatment. The intercrop clearly interacted
   with the vine and decreased its vegetative vigor. Since predawn leaf
   water potential and stomatal conductance did not differ among
   treatments, mechanism(s) other than competition for water (e.g. nutrient
   competition, allelopathy) may be responsible.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To determine the correlation between fracture toughness and
   leucite content in dental porcelains. The mechanisms by which leucite
   influences the fracture toughness of dental porcelains were also
   investigated.
   Methods: Six porcelains were tested: A (Ceramco I/Dentsply), B (Ceramco
   II/Dentsitply), C (Finesse/ Dentsply), D (d.Sign/Ivoctar), Cb
   (Cerabien/Noritake) and V (Vitadur Alpha/Vita). Bar-shaped specimens
   were produced, and their fracture toughness was determined by means of
   the single-edge precracked beam (SEPB) method. The test consisted of
   fracturing the specimen after a precrack was generated by a bridge-anvil
   device. K-Ic, was calculated based on fracture force and size of the
   precrack. Microstructural analysis and determination of the leucite
   volume fraction were performed on polished specimens etched with 2\% HF
   for 15 s by means of scanning electron microscopy. Fractographic
   analysis was performed on fracture surfaces.
   Results: Porcelains A and B presented the highest leucite contents
   (22\%) and similar K-Ic values (1.23 and 1.22 MPa M-1/2, respectively),
   significantly higher than the other materials. Porcelains C and D
   presented similar K-Ic values (0.81 and 0.93 MPa m(1/2), respectively),
   but different leucite contents (6 and 15\%, respectively). Porcelain D
   and D presented higher K-Ic compared to porcelains Cb and V (0.71 and
   0.75 MPa m(1/)2, respectively), which presented similar values and the
   lowest leucite contents (0\%). Fractographic analysis showed that
   porcelains with higher Leucite content presented higher incidence of
   crack deflection.
   Conclusions: For the materials evaluated in this study, the leucite
   content was directly related to K-Ic. The main toughening mechanism
   observed was crack deflection around leucite particles and clusters. (c)

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report on the design, fabrication, and implementation
   of ultrasensitive micromechanical oscillators. Our ultrathin
   single-crystal silicon cantilevers with integrated magnetic structures
   are the first of their kind: They are fabricated using a novel
   high-yield process in which magnetic film patterning and deposition are
   combined with cantilever fabrication. These novel devices have been
   developed for use as cantilever magnetometers and as force sensors in
   nuclear magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM). These two
   applications have achieved nanometer-scale resolution using the
   cantilevers described in this work. Current magnetic moment sensitivity
   achieved for the devices, when used as magnetometers, is 10(-15) J/T at
   room temperature, which is more than a 1000-fold improvement in
   sensitivity, compared to conventional magnetometers. Current room
   temperature force sensitivity of MRFM cantilevers is similar to 10(-16)
   N/root Hz, which is comparable to the room temperature sensitivities of
   similar devices of its type. Finite element modeling was used to improve
   design parameters, ensure that the devices meet experimental demands,
   and correlate mode shape with observed results. The photolithographic
   fabrication process was optimized, yielding an average of similar to
   85\% and alignment better than 1 mu m. Postfabrication-focused ion-beam
   milling was used to further pattern the integrated magnetic structures
   when nanometer scale dimensions were required.}},

Abstract = {{Beneficiation of coal refers to the production of wash coal from raw
   coal with the help of some suitable beneficiation technologies. The
   processed coal is used by the different steel plants to serve their
   purpose during the manufacturing process of steel. The present paper
   deals with the optimal planning for blending raw coal of different
   grades used for beneficiation with a view to satisfy the requirements of
   the end users with desired specifications. The input specifications of
   coal samples are known whereas the output specifications are imprecise
   in nature. The aim of the work is to fix the level of the raw coal from
   different coal seams to be fed for beneficiation to meet the desired
   target of yield and ash percentage to maximum extent. Further. it is
   also desired by the decision-maker (I)M) to restrict the input cost of
   raw coal to be fed for beneficiation. The problem is modeled as
   multicriteria decision-making problem with imprecise specifications.
   Fuzzy set theoretic approach has been used and a corresponding model has
   been developed. The solution of the problem would enable the DM to
   optimize the raw coal feed with existing available specifications from
   different collieries along with the overall degree of satisfaction. (c)

Abstract = {{Objective. To determine clinical or biological associations between mast
   cell density, blood clotting, angiogenesis, and survival of patients
   with advanced ovarian cancer.
   Methods. Tumor tissue sections were assessed for mast cell density by
   staining for mast cell tryptase, blood clotting by staining of
   thrombosed blood vessels, and angiogenesis by CD34 expression.
   Chi-square, Kaplan-Meier, and Cox proportional hazard statistical
   analyses were used.
   Results. 44 women with stage III-IV ovarian cancers had tumor blocks
   available for immunohistochemical analysis. Higher mean vessel density
   (MVD) (> 11 vessels/400x field) predicted for better survival than lower
   MVD (<= 11 vessels/400x field) (P = 0.004). Women whose tumors had low
   levels of peri-tumoral mast cell infiltration had a mean survival of
   40.6 months compared to 50.6 months in those whose tumors had high
   levels (P = 0.47). Tumors with higher MVD and high peri-tumoral mast
   cell infiltration had a mean survival of 80.3 months compared to 37.8
   months in those with low mast cell density or low MVD (P = 0.015).
   Patients with tumors showing a low degree of blood clotting had a mean
   survival of 45.5 compared to 45.1 months in those with tumors showing a
   high degree of blood clotting (P = 0.91). There was no significant
   association between angiogenesis and mast cell density (P = 0.123). In
   multivariate analysis, higher MVD remained as a significant prognostic
   factor for improved survival after adjusting for clotting and mast cell
   density.
   Conclusions. Our data suggest that peri-tumoral mast cell infiltration
   in tumors with high MVD predicts for improved survival in women with
   advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Numerous studies have now demonstrated that lower urinary tract symptoms
   (LUTS) are associated with erectile dysfunction (ED) in men independent
   of age or general health. Because one-third of men over the age of 50
   will develop LUTS and a recent study showed ED in 62\% of patients
   presenting for LUTS, the importance of determining the mechanistic link
   between these two pathologies is clear. Using a rabbit model of partial
   bladder outlet obstruction (PBOO), a primary cause of LUTS, we have
   identified an increased basal corpus cavernosum smooth muscle (CCSM)
   tone associated with an elevated level of smooth muscle myosin (SMM)
   phosphorylation in PBOO compared with sham-operated control rabbits
   (sham). Results from in vitro kinase and phosphatase assays using
   purified smooth muscle myosin showed increased kinase and decreased
   phosphatase activities in cellular extracts from corpora cavernosa
   isolated from PBOO compared with sham rabbits. Increased Rho-kinase
   expression in the CCSM of PBOO rabbits was suggested by the observations
   that Rho-kinase inhibitors attenuated the increased kinase activity and
   were less effective in relaxing CCSM strips from PBOO vs. sham rabbits.
   This hypothesis was then confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blotting, which
   demonstrated increased expression of both isoforms of Rho-kinase (ROK
   alpha and ROK beta). Increased SMM basal phosphorylation (necessary for
   SM contraction) in the CCSM of PBOO rabbits, mediated via an increase in
   Rho-kinase expression/activity, would be expected to make the CCSM more
   difficult to relax (necessary for erection), which suggests that the
   RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway as being involved in the mechanism for

Abstract = {{The handwriting problems of elementary schoolchildren were investigated
   in this study. A questionnaire for evaluation of Chinese handwriting was
   developed and then administered to 165 children with handwriting
   deficits. Factor analysis indicated that the questionnaire has six major
   dimensions, including construction of characters, accuracy,
   developmental delay, pencil grip, gross movement, and emotional
   reaction. These six dimensions were utilized to search for Subtypes of
   handwriting deficits. By further sampling,mother 209 children were
   administered the handwriting evaluation questionnaire to classify their
   handwriting deficits. According to the severity of deficits on different
   dimensions of the questionnaire, K-means clustering was utilized to
   classify the children into four subtypes of mild, severe,
   motor-originated, and academic learning dysfunction Subtypes, The
   classification by subtype might be helpful in planning interventions for
   children with handwriting deficits.}},

Abstract = {{Suprasellar arachnoid cysts represent less than 10\% of all intracranial
   arachnoid cysts. Some of them may be quiescent throughout life, some may
   become symptomatic as they become enlarged and some disappear
   spontaneously. In this study we discuss the surgical strategies for
   endoscopic and endoscope-assisted treatment of suprasellar (Mickey
   Mouse) cysts and analyze the clinical results and experience collected
   over some years in our department upon doing these operations routinely.
   Between December 1996 and December 2003, 13 patients (7 female and 6
   male patients), mean age 29 years, underwent endoscopic or
   endoscope-assisted procedures for suprasellar cysts at our department.
   The indication for surgical treatment was based on the neurological and
   radiological examination. The goal of surgical treatment was to
   normalize the cerebrospinal fluid flow and to establish a communication,
   permanently, between the cyst cavity and the intraventricular or/and
   subarachnoid space. Intraoperatively we observed in all patients no com
   pi i cations. Seven of 13 patients, who had received shunt systems in
   other hospitals before admission in our clinic, remained shunt-free
   postoperatively. Overall clinical improvement was achieved for a long
   period of between 6 and 74 months in 11 patients, one developed a
   psychomotor disturbance and another one, who had epilepsy before
   treatment, was unchanged postoperatively. Our data suggest that
   suprasellar cysts are well treated by endoscopic or endoscope-assisted
   procedures with good clinical outcome and low surgical morbidity.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine the effects of chronic methylphenidate use on the
   reproductive axis of adolescent female rats.
   Design: Controlled prospective study.
   Setting: University research laboratory.
   Animal(s): Twenty prepubertal female Sprague Dawley rats.
   Intervention (s): Subcutaneous implantation of drug-filled Alzet
   minipumps (Durect Corporation, Cupertino, CA) for infusing
   methylphenidate (450 mu g/d, treated) or physiological saline (control)
   for 4 weeks. Estrous cyclicity was checked from 3 weeks of pump
   implantation till the termination of the experiments. Animals were
   killed after 4 weeks of treatment.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Estrous cyclicity, pituitary and peripheral FSH
   and LH, serum estrogen and progesterone, ovarian histology, and
   immunocytochemistry for localizing growth differentiation factor-9 and
   activin receptors-I.
   Result(s): Compared with the control group, the treated animals
   exhibited the following: {[}1] poor vaginal opening and erratic estrous
   cyclicity; {[}2] undeveloped, disrupted, or prematurely luteinized
   ovarian follicles-, {[}3] absence of growth differentiation factor-9 and
   of activin receptors I and IB in the oocyte; and {[}4] high levels of LH
   in the pituitary.
   Conclusion(s): Chronic methylphenidate administration during adolescence
   perturbs pubertal onset, adversely affects maturation of the female
   reproductive axis by retarding pituitary LH release, and adversely
   affects ovarian folliculogenesis. These novel findings may have
   significant clinical implications in evaluating the effects of
   methylphenidate abuse on adolescent health.}},

Abstract = {{The analysis and verification of a Watt I six-bar furniture hinge
   mechanism were carried out in this article. Using the characteristics of
   the topological structure of existing hinge mechanisms and design
   requirement specification, six hinge designs were synthesized. The most
   suitable design was selected for kinematic analysis with the vector loop
   method. The equations of motion of the mechanism were then derived by
   the Hamilton principle and Lagrange undetermined multipliers method and
   simplified using coordinate partitioning method. The differential
   algebraic equation was subsequently solved by using the Runge-Kutta
   method. From numerical simulation, the dynamic response of the door
   under various loading conditions was obtained and was found to fulfil
   the design requirements and constraints. Results obtained from
   experiments and numerical simulation were comparable, which demonstrated
   the success of this study. It is anticipated that this research will be
   beneficial to the further development of hinge designs for use in
   furniture.}},

Title = {{Location-based scheduling and pricing for energy and reserves: a

Journal = {{DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{563-577}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{It is well known that given a network that can become constrained on
   voltage or real power flows, reserves must also be spatially located in
   order to handle all credible contingencies. However, to date, there is
   no credible science-based method for assigning and pricing reserves in
   this way. Presented in this paper is a responsive-reserve scheduling
   algorithm incorporating constraints imposed by grid security
   considerations, which include one base case (intact system) and a list
   of credible contingencies (line out, unit lost, and load growth) of the
   system. By following a cost-minimizing co-optimization procedure, both
   power and reserves are allocated spatially for the combined energy and
   reserve markets. With the Lagrange multipliers obtained, the scheduling
   algorithm also reveals the locational shadow prices for the reserve and
   energy requirements. Unlike other pricing and scheduling methods in use,
   which are usually ad hoe and are based on engineering judgment and
   experience, this proposed formulation is likely to perform better in
   restructured markets when market power is a potential problem. An
   illustrative example of a modified IEEE 30-bus system is used to
   introduce concepts and present results. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V All rights

Abstract = {{Cellular responses after spinal cord injury include activation of
   astrocytes, degeneration of neurons and oligodendrocytes, and reactions
   of the ependymal layer and meningeal cells. Because it has been
   suggested that tissue repair partially recapitulates morphogenesis, we
   have investigated the expression of several developmentally prominent
   molecules after spinal cord injury of adult mice where neurogenesis does
   not occur after injury. Cell fate determinants Numb, Notch-1, Shh and
   BMPs are abundantly expressed during development but mostly decline in
   the adult. In the present study, we investigated whether these genes are
   triggered by spinal cord injury as a sign of attempted recapitulation of
   development. Expression of Numb, Notch, Shh, BMP2/4 and Msx1/2 was
   analysed in the adult mouse spinal cord after compression injury by in
   situ hybridization up to 1 month after injury. The mRNA expression
   levels of Notch-1, Numb, Shh, BMP4 and Msx2 increased in the grey matter
   and/or white matter and in the ependyma rostral and caudal to the lesion
   site after injury. However, BMP2 and Msx1 were not up-regulated.
   Combining immunohistochemistry of cell type-specific markers with in
   situ hybridization we found that all the up-regulated genes were
   expressed in neurons. Moreover, Numb, BMP4 and Msx2 were also expressed
   by GFAP-positive astrocytes, while Shh was expressed by MBP-positive
   oligodendrocytes. In conclusion, the cell fate determinants Notch-1,
   Numb, Shh, BMP4 and Msx2 are expressed in neurons and/or glial cells
   after injury in a time-dependent manner, suggesting that these genes
   reflect to some extent an endogenous self-repair potential by
   recapitulating some features of development.}},

Abstract = {{Thickness dependence of the properties of GaAsN grown on GaAs was
   investigated by characterizing GaAs/GaAS(0.982)N(0.018)/ GaAs Schottky
   diodes by current-voltage (I-V), capacitance-voltage (C-V) profiling and
   deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS). I-V characteristics show a
   considerable increase in the saturation current when the GaAsN thickness
   is increased from 60 to 250 A. As GaAsN thickness is increased further,
   the I-V characteristic deviates from that of a normal Schottky diode
   with a large series resistance. These I-V characteristics correlate well
   with carrier distribution. In thick GaAsN samples, C-V profiling shows
   carrier depletion in the top GaAs layer and frequency-dispersion
   accumulation in the GaAsN layer. DLTS spectra show that the carrier
   depletion in the top GaAs layer is due to an EL2 trap and the
   frequency-dispersion accumulation is due to the removal of electrons
   from a trap at 0.35 eV in the GaAsN layer. Increasing the GaAsN
   thickness markedly increases the magnitude of both traps. The large
   series resistance in thick GaAsN samples is due to EL2 that markedly
   depletes the top GaAs layer.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a new approach for image segmentation that is based on
   low-level features for color and texture. It is aimed at segmentation of
   natural scenes, in which the color and texture of each segment does not
   typically exhibit uniform statistical characteristics. The proposed
   approach combines knowledge of human perception with an understanding of
   signal characteristics in order to segment natural scenes into
   perceptually/semantically. uniform regions. The proposed approach is
   based on two types of spatially adaptive low-level features. The first
   describes the local color composition in terms of spatially adaptive
   dominant colors, and the second describes the spatial characteristics of
   the grayscale component of the texture. Together, they provide a simple
   and effective characterization of texture that the proposed algorithm
   uses to obtain robust and, at the same time, accurate and precise
   segmentations. The resulting segmentations convey semantic information
   that can be used for content-based retrieval. The performance of the
   proposed algorithms is demonstrated in the domain of photographic
   images, including low-resolution, degraded, and compressed images.}},

   significant radiation mechanism additional to a power law continuum for
   those sources. However, many sources (about 30\%) are still located very
   close to the blackbody distribution indicative of the possible
   contributions from the host galaxies. In addition, the average spectral
   index derived for the near infrared region is 0.66 +/- 0.34 that is
   rather smaller than that from the previous results indicative of the

Abstract = {{Background This study aimed at assessing the effect of noninvasive limb
   preconditioning on myocardial infarct size, and determining whether
   nitric oxide and neurogenic pathway play an important role in the
   mechanism of acute remote ischemic preconditioning (IPC)
   Methods Forty Wistar rats were randomly divided into four experimental
   groups. In Group I, the rats underwent 30-minute occlusion of the left
   anterior descending coronary artery, and 120-minute reperfusion. In
   Group P-L the rats underwent four cycles of 5-minute occlusion and
   reperfusion of both hind limbs using a tourniquet before the experiment
   was continued as in Group I. In Group PL-N and Group PL-H we
   administered L-nitro-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) 10 mg/kg or
   hexamethonium chloride 20 mg/kg intravenously, 10 minutes before IPC.
   Infarct size as a percentage of the area at risk was determined by
   triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining.
   Results There were no statistically significant differences in mean
   arterial pressure and heart rate among these groups at any time point
   during the experiment ( P > 0.05). The myocardial infarct size ( IS) was
   decreased significantly in Group P-L and Group PL-H compared with Group
   I, and the IS/AAR was 34.5\% +/- 7.6\%, 35.9\% +/- 8.6\% and 58.5\% +/-
   8.5\%, respectively (P < 0.05). The IS/AAR was 49.1\% +/- 6.5\% in Group
   PL-N, and there was no significant difference compared with Group I ( P
   > 0.05).
   Conclusions Noninvasive limb IPC Is effective in protecting the
   myocardium from ischemia reperfusion injury. Nitric oxide plays an
   important role in the mechanism of acute remote IPC, in which the
   neurogenic pathway is not involved.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to examine urinary concentrating ability
   and protein expression of renal aquaporins and ion transporters in
   glucocorticoid-deficient (GD) rats in response to water deprivation as
   compared with control rats. Rats underwent bilateral adrenalectomies,
   followed only by aldosterone replacement (GD) or both aldosterone and
   dexamethasone replacement (control). As compared with control rats, the
   GD rats demonstrated a decrease in cardiac output and mean arterial
   pressure. In response to 36-h water deprivation, GD rats demonstrated
   significantly greater urine flow rate and decreased urine osmolality as
   compared with control rats at comparable serum osmolality and plasma
   vasopressin concentrations. The initiator of the countercurrent
   concentrating mechanism, the sodium-potassium-2 chloride co-transporter,
   was significantly decreased, as was the medullary osmolality in the GD
   rats versus control rats. There was also a decrease in inner medulla
   aquaporin-2 (AQP2) and urea transporter A1 (UT-A1) in GD rats as
   compared with control rats. There was a decrease in outer medulla Gs
   alpha protein, an important factor in vasopressin-mediated regulation of
   AQP2. Immunohistochemistry studies confirmed the decreased expression of
   AQP2 and UT-A1 in kidneys of GD rats as compared with control. In
   summary, impairment in the urinary concentrating mechanism was
   documented in GD rats in association with impaired countercurrent
   multiplication, diminished osmotic equilibration via AQP2, and
   diminished urea equilibration via UT-A1. These events occurred primarily
   in the relatively oxygen-deficient medulla and may have been initiated,
   at least in part, by the decrease in mean arterial pressure and thus
   renal perfusion pressure in this area of the kidney.}},

Abstract = {{The attribute-oriented induction (AOI for short) method is one of the
   most important data mining methods. The input of the AOI method contains
   a relational table and a concept tree (con\textbackslash{}cept
   hierarchy) for each attribute, and the output is a small relation
   summarizing the general characteristics of the task-relevant data.
   Although AOI is very useful for inducing general characteristics, it has
   the limitation that it can only be applied to relational data, where
   there is no order among the data items. If the data are ordered, the
   existing AOI methods are unable to find the generalized knowledge. In
   view of this weakness, this paper proposes a dynamic programming
   algorithm, based on AOI techniques, to find generalized knowledge from
   an ordered list of data. By using the algorithm, we can discover a
   sequence of K generalized tuples describing the general characteristics
   of different segments of data along the list, where K is a parameter
   specified by users. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A new smart adhesive joint system was developed by integrating (surface

   electric field applied to the surface bonded piezoelectric patches. As a
   result, the stress distribution in the adhesive layer is more uniformly
   redistributed, thus reducing the stress concentration in the ends of the
   interface bond line. A detailed theoretical model was developed for the
   analysis of a single-strap adhesive joint system to study the influence
   of the surface bonding of piezoelectric patches and the distribution of
   the stress in the adhesive layer. The integrity of the proposed solution
   was verified by analyzing the joint with a finite element method. The

Abstract = {{Chitosan is a natural biopolymer which can be used to replace aluminum
   salts and chemical polymers as a coagulant to avoid the human health
   problems caused by the residual of aluminum and chemical polymers in
   water. Chitin is a major component in shrimp and crab shells, and
   chitosan can be produced from chitin via a deacetylated process. Since
   the biodegradation of chitin is very slow, large amount of discards from
   the processing of crustaceans has become a major concern in seafood
   industry. Therefore, more works are need to find the possible
   applications of chitin, chitosan and their derivatives. This research
   used chitosan as a coagulant to recover wheat dregs in the wastewater
   from washing the mash and the lauter unit in a brewery, and regards this
   study as an example to understand the influences of the characters of
   the wastewater on the treatment plant of brewery. The result shows that
   the wastewater from the mash and the lauter units can have the best
   treatment efficiency at the coagulant dosage of 120 mg/L in the original
   pH 4.5. Increasing the solution pH decreased the turbidity removal
   efficiency. The dominant mechanisms for chitosan to remove colloids in
   the wastewater are charge bridging and neutralization, and the later
   becomes less significant in the high pH. The coagulant of chitosan
   removed most of the colloidal form organic matter in the wastewater, but
   it has only little effect on the removal of dissolving organic matter.
   Chitosan is a natural material, after coagulation the sludge from the
   mash and lauter wastewater can serve directly as an animal husbandry
   fodder after been dehydrated. Therefore, the loading to wastewater
   treatment plant and the cost of treatment could be reduced.}},

Abstract = {{The Mycoplasma hominis vaa gene encodes a highly variable surface
   antigen involved in adhesion to host cells. We studied 15 clinical
   isolates of Mycoplasma hominis with three types of the vaa gene. These
   vaa versions determine various forms of Vaa protein, which are
   characterized by different quantity and structure of homologous
   replaceable cassettes. Each cassette contains heptad repeats and sites
   for adherence. The differences on single nucleotides were observed in
   the primary sequences of the homologous modules of the vaa gene. A high
   frequency of nucleotide replacements in V module of the vaa gene (first
   and/or second position in codon) was determined. This region with
   various clusters of direct and indirect repeats of nucleotide sequences
   is incorporated into the area of the vaa gene. Amino-acid sequences
   corresponding to the hyper-variable region of the vaa gene are
   associated with the sections of coiled-coils and loops of Vaa. These
   bacterial regions involved in interaction with the host cell membranes
   could yield useful indications for more insights into the mechanism of
   mycoplasma persistence in humans.}},

Abstract = {{Fibrinogen, an inflammatory marker as well as a fundamental part of the
   coagulation cascade, is suggested to play a significant role in the
   pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and complications of atherothrombotic
   diseases. The aim of this study was to determine if plasma fibrinogen is
   an independent risk factor for long-term survival in patients with
   peripheral artery disease (PAD). Altogether, 139 Chinese patients (88
   men, 51 women) with PAD were consecutively recruited for the study.
   Atherothrombotic risk factors and fibrinogen levels were determined at
   presentation, and all patients were followed up for mortality
   prospectively. The mean follow-up was 6 years. All variables were first
   correlated with survival rates using Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared
   by means of the log-rank test. Significant risk factors were identified,
   and multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the
   independent contribution of the fibrinogen level to the risk of
   mortality. During follow-up, 95 patients (68.3\%) died. The overall
   survival rate was 77.7\% at 3 years, 56.8\% at 5 years, and 31.2\% at 10
   years (standard errors 0.05, 0.06, and 0.07, respectively). All-cause
   mortality rate increased with an elevated fibrinogen level. Eighty
   percent of patients with a fibrinogen level > 3.4 g/L had a survival
   time of less than 3 years (p = 0.002). This relation was also
   demonstrated within patients with critical ischemia. The plasma
   fibrinogen level was thus identified as an independent risk factor for
   mortality in PAD patients after adjusting for confounding factors.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, digital stereoscopic imaging and reconstruction
   techniques have been developed for the tracking and velocity measurement
   of solid particles using a single camera. The variable shutter speeds of
   a digital camera are used to control the trajectory length of the
   tracked particles. A colour coding method has been developed to resolve
   the ambiguity of particle flow direction and avoid the confusion in
   manually matching particle pairs. The method could be applied to
   validate the automated particle matching algorithms. Besides using
   points (particle centroids) a matching algorithm for a stereo
   reconstruction pixel to pixel matching algorithm has been applied. The
   latter is able to resolve not only the particle position but also the
   shape and orientation of a non-spherical particle. This is of importance
   since non-spherical particle or bubble geometry is common in a practical
   system and the non-spherical geometry has a strong effect on the
   particle or bubble dynamics. The potential of using this system for the
   quantitative 3D measurement of multiphase flow has been demonstrated
   with several test cases. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We obtain a decomposition result for the steady state queue length
   distribution in egalitarian processor-sharing (PS) models. In
   particular, for multi-class egalitarian PS queues, we show that the
   marginal queue length distribution for each class equals the queue
   length distribution of an equivalent single class PS model with a random
   number of permanent customers. Similarly, the mean sojourn time
   (conditioned on the initial service requirement) for each class can be
   obtained by conditioning on the number of permanent customers. The
   decomposition result implies linear relations between the marginal queue
   length probabilities, which also hold for other PS models such as the
   egalitarian PS models with state-dependent system capacity that only
   depends on the total number of customers in the system. Based on the
   exact decomposition result for egalitarian PS queues, we propose a
   similar decomposition for discriminatory processor-sharing (DPS) models,
   and numerically show that the approximation is accurate for moderate
   differences in service weights. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Comparative studies of the transport properties-resistance,
   magnetoresistance, and Hall effect-of Er/Sc multilayer structures and
   erbium films prepared by the same deposition technology are carried out
   for the first time. Those properties of the structures are modified
   substantially in comparison with those of elemental erbium. The
   magnetoresistance of the samples is ``giant,{''} although it cannot
   compete in absolute magnitude with the values for superlattices based on
   d ferromagnetic materials. In the region of helium temperatures the Hall
   coefficient in the multilayer systems is more than an order of magnitude
   greater than at room temperature. It follows from the data for the Hall
   coefficient and magnetoresistance in that temperature region that the
   zero-field magnetization of the f structure is greater than the
   magnetization of the bulk f material in the ferromagnetic state. The
   conductance of the Er/Sc multilayer structure at T > 20 K is lower than
   at helium temperatures. The features mentioned are described in terms of
   a temperature-induced rearrangement of the magnetic ordering of the

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{40}},

Pages = {{271-284}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Phylogenetic relationships in the genus Aethomys were examined based on
   qualitative cranial data for all currently recognized species. A
   cladistic analysis suggested the presence of three clades: 1) A.
   bocagei, A. thomasi, A. silindensis, A. kaiseri, and A. nyikae; 2) A.
   chrysophilus, A. ineptus, and A. hindei; 3) A. granti, A. namaquensis,
   and A. stannarius. These phylogenctic groupings are largely inconsistent
   with previously postulated supraspecific relationships for the genus.
   Nonetheless, relationships within each clade broadly correspond with
   some previously suggested evolutionary hypotheses among some members of
   the genus, the only notable exception being a close affinity between two
   southern African taxa (A. namaquensis and A. granti) and the
   geographically disjunct West African endemic, A. stannarius. A phylogram
   derived from an analysis of anagenetic divergence among taxa. supported
   the widely-held view of a close affinity between A. narnaquensis and A.
   grand that has traditionally led to their inclusion in the subgenus
   Micaelamys. These results are relatively concordant with recent
   molecular studies based on microcomplement fixation of albumin,
   mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b and 16S rRNA data, which collectively
   suggest that the genus Aethomys is paraphyletic. Possible paraphyly is
   also reflected by a relatively low bootstrap value at the node uniting
   all ingroup taxa in this study, as well as previous studies on dental
   morphology, modes of karyotypic change, and gross sperm and bacular
   morphology, and strongly supports the taxonomic elevation of the
   currently recognized subgenera Micaelatays and Aethomys to full generic
   rank. Despite the broad correspondence between the morphological and
   molecular data, homoplasy and low bootstrap support in the present
   investigation point to the need for a careful consideration of the power
   and choice of morphological characters in future studies on this and
   related groups of murine rodents.}},

Abstract = {{In critical binary liquid mixtures the preferential adsorption that
   occurs at liquid-vapor or liquid-solid surfaces is expected to be
   described by a universal surface scaling function. In this paper, we
   show that aniline strongly adsorbs at an oxide-coated Si wafer surface
   from a critical mixture of aniline + cyclohexane where this solid-liquid
   adsorption can be described by the same universal function found at
   liquid-vapor surfaces. For a tetrabromoethane + n-dodecane critical
   mixture the n-dodecane adsorption on an alkylsilane coated Si wafer
   cannot be described by previously determined adsorption functions. We
   speculate that this discrepancy is caused by chemical heterogeneities at
   the alkylsilane surface due to differing surface distributions of -CH3
   and -CH2- groups within the silane layer.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{4, 1}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements have been performed
   to compare the effect of the salts KF, KCl, and KBr on crystallization
   in aqueous solution of lysozyme protein. It is found that the propensity
   of the salt to crystallize protein follows the Hoffmeister series (KF <
   KCl < KBr) with marked differences in the effect of these salts. In pure
   protein solution, lysozyme macromolecules are prolate ellipsoidal with
   semimajor and semiminor axes as 22 and 13.5 A, respectively. SANS also
   gives that the effective (structural+counterion) charge (Z) on the
   protein as obtained by taking into account screened Coulomb interaction
   between the protein macromolecules is found to be much smaller than the
   structural charge. There is decrease in Z suggesting the higher
   counterion condensation on protein with the increase in the
   concentration. The counterion condensation seems to be responsible for
   the differences in the effect of different salts. It is also found that
   with the addition of salts, lysozyme macromolecules convert to dimers,
   and for the same salt concentration the comparative effect of different
   salts follows the Hoffmeister series. Time evolved measurements prior to
   and after the crystallization show that the protein solution mostly
   consists of monomers and dimers. Interestingly, higher-mers are not
   observed in these measurements as perhaps they are formed in very small
   numbers towards the process that leads to the crystallization. The time
   dependent data have been used to obtain the fraction of crystallization
   as a function of time.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of a postoperative early isolated
   lumbar extension muscle-strengthening program on pain, disability,
   return to work, and power of back Muscle after operation for herniated
   lumbar disc.
   METHODS: Seventy-five patients were randomized into an exercise group
   (20 men, 15 women) and a control group (18 men, 22 women) to perform a
   prospective controlled trial of a lumbar extension exercise program in
   patients who underwent lumbar microdiscectomy or percutaneous endoscopic
   discectomy. Six weeks after surgery, patients in the exercise group
   undertook a 12-week lumbar extension exercise program. The assessment
   included measures of lumbar extensor power by the MedX (Ocala, FL)
   lumbar extension machine, Muscle mass of multifidus and longissimus
   (L4-L5 cross-sectional area) by computed tomography. All patients
   completed the visual analog scale and the Oswestry disability index to
   assess pain and disability, respectively. Return to work data were also
   investigated.
   RESULTS: After the exercise program, significant improvements were
   observed in the exercise group versus the control group for lumbar
   extensor power (51.67\% versus 17.55\%, respectively; P < 0.05), the
   cross-sectional area of multifidus and longissimus muscle (29.23\%
   versus 7.2\%, respectively; P < 0.05), and the visual analog scale score
   (2.51 versus 4.30, respectively; P < 0.05). The percentages of returning
   to work within 4 months after Surgery were significantly greater in the
   exercise group than in the control group (87\% versus 24\%,
   respectively). Although this was not statistically significant (P >
   0.05), the Oswestry disability index scores in the exercise group were
   better than that in control group (24.6 versus 30.6, respectively).
   CONCLUSION: These results support the positive effects of the
   postoperative early lumbar extension muscle-strengthening program on
   pain, return to work, and strength of back muscles in patients after
   operation of herniated lumbar disc.}},

Abstract = {{DNA cytosine methylation plays a considerable role in normal
   development, gene regulation, and carcinogenesis. Hypermethylation of
   the promoters of some tumor suppressor genes and the associated
   silencing of these genes often occur in certain cancer types. The
   reversal of this process by DNA methylation inhibitors is a promising
   new strategy for cancer therapy. In addition to the four
   well-characterized nucleoside analogue methylation inhibitors,
   5-azacytidine, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR),
   5fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine, and zebularine, there is a growing list of
   non-nucleoside inhibitors. However, a systemic study comparing these
   potential demethylating agents has not been done. In this study, we
   examined three non-nucleoside demethylating agents,
   (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, hydralazine, and procainamide, and
   compared their effects and potencies with 5-Aza-CdR, the most potent DNA
   methylation inhibitor. We found that 5-Aza-CdR is far more effective in
   DNA methylation inhibition as well as in reactivating genes, compared

Abstract = {{Background Atypical antipsychotics have become the mainstay of
   management of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders due to low
   risk of extrapyramidal symptoms. However, postmarketing data has
   reported atypical antipsychotic agents being associated with
   hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). We believe this to be
   the first published report of hyperglycaemia and DKA with the newest
   atypical antipsychotic agent, aripiprazole.
   Case report A 34-year-old African-American female with schizophrenia
   presented to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and malaise
   for 3-4 days shortly after initiation of aripiprazole therapy. Initial
   laboratory results revealed significant hyperglycaemia with metabolic
   acidosis. The patient received treatment for DKA with an intravenous
   insulin infusion and fluid replacement. Isophane insulin suspension (NPH
   insulin) was begun immediately following the insulin drip and continued
   upon discharge from the hospital. Outpatient follow-up information was
   not available.
   Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first case report of
   aripiprazole associated with hyperglycaemia and DKA. This case is
   striking in that DKA occurred 4 days following initiation of
   aripiprazole and the patient had rapid resolution of symptoms and
   normalization of laboratory values upon discontinuation of aripiprazole.
   It is important that health-care providers monitor for hyperglycaemia
   when prescribing atypical antipsychotics including aripiprazole.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Decompilation is the process of translating object code to source code
   and is usually the first step towards the reverse-engineering of an
   application. Many obfuscation techniques and tools have been developed,
   with the aim of modifying a program, such that its functionalities are
   preserved, while its understandability is compromised for a human reader
   or the decompilation is made unsuccessful. Some approaches rely on
   malicious identifiers renaming, i.e., on the modification of the program
   identifiers in order to introduce confusion and possibly prevent the
   decompilation of the code.
   In this work we introduce a new technique to overcome the obfuscation of
   Java programs by identifier renaming. Such a technique relies on the
   intelligent modification of identifiers in Java bytecode.
   We present a new software tool which implements our technique and allows
   the processing of an obfuscated program in order to rename the
   identifiers as required by our technique. Moreover, we show how to use
   the existing tools to provide a partial implementation of the technique
   we propose.
   Finally, we discuss the feasibility of our approach by showing how to
   contrast the obfuscation techniques based on malicious identifier
   renaming recently presented in literature. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Social and cultural institutions influence how societies organize
   themselves to extract,resources, affecting the ways in which resources
   are used and ultimately managed. In Papua New Guinea, marine tenure
   rights largely determine bow individuals and communities use inshore
   marine resources. Whether institutions of customary marine tenure can
   play a role in resource conservation or are simply mechanisms to avoid
   conflict and maximize exploitation is a matter of debate. In the Manus
   Province, an unusual marine tenure and trade arrangement has resulted in
   the community of Andra producing the majority of lime powder used for
   consumption with betel nut. A socioeconomic and ecological assessment
   revealed that more than 90\% of Andra's community was engaged in lime
   production, an industry contributing an estimated US\$102,000 +/- 28,000
   to the village annually. The main source of material used in lime
   production at Andra is live branching coral (primarily Acropora spp.).
   The annual removal of approximately 2,113 +/- 660 m(3) of coral appears
   to have produced significant changes in coral cover in Andra's reefs,
   resulting in a lower percent cover of bard corals (24 +/- 2\% SE)
   compared with neighboring reefs with little harvesting (33 +/- 3\% SE).
   Existing common-property regimes may provide incentives for individuals
   to sustainably use their own reef area. A lapse in supply, however,
   could threaten the community's virtual monopoly and provide other
   villages with an opportunity to gain a market share of lime production.
   Thus, the marine tenure and trade arrangements that facilitated Andra's
   position as the dominant supplier of lime to the province may result in
   incentives for the overexploitation of coral in ways that are
   paradoxical to an open-access scenario. Management interventions that
   aim to reduce the ecological impacts of coral harvesting should reflect
   the community's economic dependence on the practice and the
   sociocultural institutions that influence resource use.}},

Abstract = {{The cell-to-cell communication system referred to as quorum sensing (QS)
   is based on the principle that bacteria secrete hormone-like compounds
   referred to as autoinducers. Upon reaching a threshold concentration,
   these autoinducers interact with transcription factors to regulate gene
   expression. We previously reported that enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia
   coli (EHEC), which is responsible for outbreaks of bloody diarrhoea,
   utilizes a QS system to regulate gene transcription. We have also
   previously shown that the quorum sensing E. coli regulators B and C
   (QseBC) may act as a two-component system to transcriptionally regulate
   the expression of flagella and motility. Here, using a reverse
   transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we show that qseBC are
   transcribed in an operon. Furthermore, using a qseBC::lacZ
   transcriptional fusion, we observed that QseB autoactivates its own
   transcription. In addition, the transcriptional start site of the qseBC
   promoter responsive to QseBC was mapped, and single-copy and multicopy
   deletion analyses were performed to determine the minimal region
   necessary for QseB transcriptional activation. These data allowed us to
   map an additional transcriptional start site for the qseBC promoter
   which may allow for a basal level of QseBC expression. Finally,
   electrophoretic mobility shift assays, competition experiments and DNase
   I footprints were performed and demonstrated that QseB directly binds to
   two sites in its own promoter. These results indicate that QseB may act
   to autoregulate its own transcription through binding to low- and
   high-affinity sites found in its promoter.}},

Abstract = {{Ferrihydrite and goethite are amongst the most important substrates for
   the sorption of contaminants in soil and other environmental media.
   Isotopic studies of the transition elements, particularly those that
   exhibit more than one oxidation state and show pH- and/or
   redox-sensitive behaviour at low temperatures, have been shown to be
   potentially useful present-day and past proxies for redox (or
   palaeoredox) conditions. We have made preliminary investigations of Fe
   isotope fractionation that take place during the formation of Fe-III
   (oxy)hydroxides (Fe-ox(III)) from an aqueous Fe-III (NO3)(3) solution
   (Fe-aq(III)) under laboratory conditions. We have attempted to keep the
   chemical system simple by excluding `vital effects' and major changes in
   redox through the maintenance of abiotic conditions and use of
   Fe-aq(III). Isotopic measurements (Fe-56/Fe-54, Fe-57/Fe-54) of the
   Fe-III(NO3)(3) stock solution, the original ferrihydrite and the mixed
   ferrihydrite/goethite-supernatant Fe-aq(III) `pairs' were carried out
   using a double focusing multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass
   spectrometer. The results reveal an apparent systematic variation
   indicating larger Delta(III)(III)(Feaq)(-Feox) with decrease in the
   ferrihydrite:goethite ratio, which reflects the time allowed for
   isotopic exchange. These values range from virtually zero (0.03\%.)
   after 24 h to 0.30 parts per thousand after 70 h. In each
   Fe-ox(III)-Fe-aq(III) `pair' the lighter Fe isotope is partitioned into
   the Fe-ox(III), leaving the Fe-aq(III) isotopically heavier. The
   observed fractionation reflects isotopic exchange of Fe between the
   Fe-ox(III) and Fe-aq(III) upon at least a two step transition of
   ferrihydrite to goethite.}},

Abstract = {{Predictions of lung cancer incidence and mortality are necessary for
   planning public health programs and clinical services. It is proposed
   that generalized additive models (GAMs) are practical for cancer rate
   prediction. Smooth equivalents for classical age-period, age-cohort, and
   age-period-cohort models are available using one-dimensional smoothing
   splines. We also propose using two-dimensional smoothing splines for age
   and period. Variance estimation can be based on the bootstrap. To assess
   predictive performance, we compared the models with a Bayesian
   age-period-cohort model. Model comparison used cross-validation and
   measures of predictive performance for recent predictions. The models
   were applied to data from the World Health Organization Mortality
   Database for females in five countries. Model choice between the
   age-period-cohort models and the two-dimensional models was equivocal
   with respect to cross-validation, while the two-dimensional GAMs had
   very good predictive performance. The Bayesian model performed poorly
   due to imprecise predictions and the assumption of linearity outside of
   observed data. In summary, the two-dimensional GAM performed well. The
   GAMs make the important prediction that female lung cancer rates in
   these countries will be stable or begin to decline in the future.}},

Abstract = {{A time-domain finite-difference solution to the equations of linear
   elasticity was used to model the propagation of lithotripsy waves in
   kidney stones. The model was used to determine the loading on the stone
   (principal stresses and strains and maximum shear stresses and strains)
   due to the impact of lithotripsy shock waves. The simulations show that
   the peak loading induced in kidney stones is generated by constructive
   interference from shear waves launched from the outer edge of the stone
   with other waves in the stone. Notably the shear wave induced loads were
   significantly larger than the loads generated by the classic Hopkinson
   or spall effect. For simulations where the diameter of the focal spot of
   the lithotripter was smaller than that of the stone the loading
   decreased by more than 50\%. The constructive interference was also
   sensitive to shock rise time and it was found that the peak tensile
   stress reduced by 30\% as rise time increased from 25 to 150 ns. These
   results demonstrate that shear waves likely play a critical role in
   stone comminution and that lithotripters with large focal widths and
   short rise times should be effective at generating high stresses inside

Title = {{Progression of dopaminergic degeneration in dementia with Lewy bodies

Abstract = {{Purpose: The objective of this study was to investigate the rate of
   progression of nigrostriatal dopaminergic loss in subjects with dementia
   with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson's disease (PD) and PD with dementia
   (PDD) using serial I-123-FP-CIT SPECT imaging. We hypothesised that
   striatal rates of decline in patients would be greater than in controls,
   and that DLB and PDD would show similar rates, reflecting the similarity
   in neurobiological mechanisms of dopaminergic loss between the two
   disorders.
   Methods: We studied 20 patients with DLB, 20 with PD, 15 with PDD and 22
   healthy age-matched controls. Semi-automated region of interest (ROI)
   analysis was performed on both baseline and repeat scans for each
   subject and mean striatal uptake ratios ( caudate, anterior and
   posterior putamen) were calculated.
   Results: Rates of decline in striatal binding between groups were
   assessed using ANCOVA. Significant differences between patients and
   controls were observed in caudate ( DLB, PD, PDD, p <= 0.01), anterior
   putamen ( DLB, PDD, p <= 0.05; PD, p= 0.07) and posterior putamen ( DLB,
   PD, PDD, p< 0.006). Rates of decline were similar between DLB, PD and
   PDD.
   Conclusion: In conclusion, this is the first study to show that
   significant progressive dopaminergic loss occurs in DLB and PDD using
   serial I-123-FP-CIT SPECT. Dementia severity and motor impairment were
   correlated with decline, suggesting that dopaminergic loss may play an
   important role in cognitive as well as motor features.}},

Abstract = {{It has been witnessed on an international scale that
   destination-specific film and television has the power to increase
   tourism demand. For destination marketers, the projected image and the
   profile of visitors attracted form significant areas of concern. Nowhere
   has this been more marked than on the Isle of Mull, Scotland, where in
   2003, a new phenomenon termed `toddler tourism' was sparked by the
   popularity of a new pre-school children's television programme called
   Balamory, which is filmed on the Island. This paper reports on a survey
   of tourism business operators on Mull and provides evidence of the
   nature and scope of the impact of television-induced tourism on tourism
   business performance and activity, indicating that the effects were
   concentrated spatially and temporally. Marketing implications are
   explored using business operators perceptions of the effects of
   marketing on tourism patterns and broad areas of concern for the future
   development of tourism as a result of television programmes are
   highlighted. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{There is widespread awareness of the decline and collapse of many
   commercially important marine fish stocks worldwide. Marine protected
   areas are increasingly proposed for use by researchers and managers, in
   combination with or separate from traditional fishery management
   techniques (e.g., harvest quotas, size quotas, etc.), to improve this
   situation. Marine reserves, also known as no-take zones, are the
   strictest of these protected areas. We review published and government
   documents that explore the costs and benefits of the Tortugas Ecological
   Reserve - a recently-created marine reserve that is part of the much
   larger Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary - to three major groups of
   stakeholders: commercial users, recreational users, and agency
   personnel. Although there is a great deal of uncertainty in all cases,
   identifying and quantifying economic costs is more straightforward than
   quantifying benefits, in part because they are more well-known and more
   short-term in nature. The costs of creating and managing this reserve
   are minor on the scale of the economy of Monroe Country, Florida, but
   benefits, although real, are unlikely to impact stakeholders in the
   short-term and are thus tenuous. In some cases, direct economic
   incentives for those few individuals suffering direct costs (i.e.,
   commercial interests) are recommendable. In the absence of such, and
   given the disparate nature of costs and benefits associated with the
   creation of marine reserves, adaptive and interactive management
   approaches, combined with traditional fishery management techniques, are
   recommended to achieve policy and management goals. This includes
   ongoing public education, outreach, and stakeholder analysis over time
   (coupled with strict law enforcement within reserves) if the ultimate
   goal of improving the sustainability of habitat and fisheries in
   surrounding waters is to be achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Since the 1950s, records front the North Sea show a gradual increase in
   temperature. Using temperature as a proxy indexing the state of the
   environment, relationships between recruitment, spawning-stock biomass,
   and temperature are investigated for major North Sea stocks. Cod,
   plaice, and sole exhibit significant negative relationships between
   temperature and recruitment, while there is evidence of a positive
   effect for saithe and whiting. Stock recruitment models that incorporate
   temperature are developed and used to examine implications for the
   management of these stocks with small increases in mean winter sea
   surface temperature. These suggest that for cod, minimum safe biomass
   reference points are unlikely to be achieved even at fishing mortality
   rates that are considered safe. The same analysis suggests that
   sustainable fishing for cod is still possible with higher yields than
   have been experienced in recent years. Crown Copyright (c) 2005

Abstract = {{The gamma-secretase enzyme complex displays intramembrane catalytic
   activity toward many type I transmembrane proteins, including the
   Alzheimer-linked amyloid-beta-protein precursor (APP) and the neuregulin
   receptor ErbB4. Active gamma-secretase is a tetrameric protein complex
   consisting of presenilin-1 ( or -2), nicastrin, PEN-2, and Aph-1a ( or
   -1b). We have recently discovered that pharmacogenetically bred
   apomorphine-susceptible Wistar rats ( APO-SUS) have only one or two
   copies of the Aph-1b gene ( termed I/I and II/II rats, respectively),
   whereas their phenotypic counterparts ( APO-UNSUS) have three copies (
   III/III). As a result, APO-SUS rats display reduced Aph-1b expression
   and a complex phenotype reminiscent of neurodevelopmental disorders.
   Here we determined in the I/I and III/III rats the gamma-secretase
   cleavage activity toward the three APP superfamily members, p75
   neurotrophin receptor, ErbB4, and neuregulin-2, and found that the
   cleavage of only a subset of the substrates was changed. Furthermore,
   the observed differences were restricted to tissues that normally
   express relatively high Aph-1b compared with Aph-1a levels. Thus, we
   provide in vivo evidence that subtle alterations in gamma-secretase
   subunit composition may lead to a variety of affected ( neuro)
   developmental signaling pathways and, consequently, a complex phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the Organization of American States has charted new
   terrain in the defense and promotion of democracy. Most significantly,
   it intervened in Peru (2000) and in Venezuela (2002-2004). The
   centerpiece of both initiatives was the establishment of a mesa, an
   OAS-facilitated intra-elite dialogue roundtable. In examining this
   ``tale of two mesas,{''} we trace three components of this approach: the
   actors at the table, the agendas, and the achievements. Although
   significant differences between the two processes make it difficult to
   articulate a single, coherent model, both the Peruvian and Venezuelan
   mesas exemplify a new mode of multilateral intervention-{''}intervention
   without intervening.{''} Though this approach has limitations, it may
   have some potential for application beyond our two case studies.}},

Abstract = {{In an effort to improve our nation's underperforming schools, education
   reformers are designing programs to educate and empower urban school
   parents. Parent involvement can be critical to a child's academic
   success, yet the education community still knows very little about the
   impact of specific parent programs. We evaluated a parent program that
   was part of a major school-university partnership. A responsive
   evaluation approach initially guided the design of our qualitative case
   study evaluation. Our social justice-oriented values, however, prompted
   us to revise our approach and adhere more closely to a social justice
   evaluation model. This change caused us to highlight the perspectives of
   low-income Latina mothers and emphasize the gap between parents' and
   educators' notions of empowerment. In this article, we describe our
   evaluation and highlight key findings that offer insightful implications
   for education practitioners, researchers, and evaluators. The findings
   pertain to the challenge of educators sharing power with urban parents
   and developing partnerships that are sensitive to the social and
   cultural factors that affect parents' values, goals, and modes of
   participation. We also emphasize the relationship between evaluation
   theory and practice and point to the potential impact of social justice

Abstract = {{A control strategy is developed in order to keep processes based on the
   hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) near operational steady states. The
   problem is treated in the context of Optimal Control for nonlinear
   systems subject to quadratic cost objectives. The original dynamics is
   shown to be accurately approximated by a bilinear model without
   increasing the dimension, so the state variables retain their physical
   meaning. Finite and infinite horizon optimal control strategies are
   developed, based on the Hamiltonian formalism, and introducing a novel
   approach for working on-line with generalized Riccati differential
   equations and the associated costate dynamics. When there exists a final
   penalty on the state deviation, then a first order quasilinear partial
   differential equation is discovered and solved for the Riccati matrix.
   The observability problem is also treated, since the natural state
   (electrode surface coverage) can not be measured continuously. The
   output variable (current density) is fed into a high-gain nonlinear
   observer based on Lyapunov's stability considerations. The whole
   approach allows for (in general time-dependent) state-feedback control.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the use of automatic image analysis to provide
   access to the morphological parameters of the microstructure during the
   sintering of ceria. Some specific techniques of image processing have
   been required and performed to automatically measure the change in the
   specific surface area, the integral of mean curvature per unit volume,
   the contiguity and the grain size distribution. The diffusional paths,
   the kinetics of densification and the mobility of the grain boundaries
   were determined. A value of about 2 was obtained for the grain size
   exponent. The densification at 1300 degrees C and probably at 1200
   degrees C is governed by the volume diffusion of the slowest species.
   Moreover, the use of a TiO2 dopant makes it possible to control the
   migration of the CeO2 grain boundaries and thus to limit grain growth.

Abstract = {{This work presents the first systematic determination of the partial
   molar volumes of lanthanide sesquioxides in silicate melts. For this
   purpose, the densities of various lanthanide-bearing Na-silicate melts
   distributed along various binary joins, where the end-members are
   Na-disilicate and one of the lanthanide sesquioxides (i.e., Ce2O3,
   Pr2O3, Nd2O3, Sm2O3, Eu2O3, Gd2O3, Tb2O3, Dy2O3, Ho2O3, Er2O3, Tm2O3,
   and Yb2O3) have been measured using the double-bob Archimedean method.
   The present results show that the addition of any lanthanide to
   Na-disilicate leads to an increase in the melt density and that the melt
   density increases with increasing atomic number of the lanthanide. From
   the present density data set, the molar volumes of these melts have been
   calculated and the partial molar volumes of each lanthanide sesquioxide
   in these melts have been determined using a linear regression through
   each binary join (i.e., Na-disilicate-lanthanide sesquioxide). This
   study indicates an ideal behavior with respect to the molar volume
   (i.e., a linear variation of the molar volume along each binary join)
   for Na-silicate melts containing up to 6 mol\% of lanthanide oxide.
   Comparison between the partial molar volumes of lanthanide sesquioxides
   obtained in this study and the molar volumes of molten lanthanide
   sesquioxides given in the literature raises the possibility, however,
   that this ideality is not maintained along the entire
   Na-disilicate-lanthanide sesquioxide binary joins. Excess volumes of
   mixing appear to be required to describe the combined volumetric data
   set.}},

Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{653-661}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The development of regular, oriented hummock-hollow or string-flark
   patterns in boreal peatlands can be explained by a simple spatially
   explicit model in which hummocks have a lower hydraulic conductivity
   than hollows and are more likely to occur at lower water levels.
   Revisiting a previously published model, the function used to simulate
   water flow is shown to be faulty. Nevertheless, the corrected model
   confirms the general conclusions of the original paper, showing the
   robustness of the approach.Five phases can be discerned in the
   development of the pattern. Once the hummock strings reach from left to
   right across the grid, there is an increase in the volume of water
   stored in the system. The number of hummocks and hollows differs
   substantially from what would be expected based on the mean water level,
   showing that their arrangement is more important than the actual number
   of hummocks.
   Parameter settings at which a pattern develops are sharply delineated,
   indicating there is a positive feedback mechanism that enhances initial
   patterning. Like in natural mire systems, the patterns anastomose and
   merge. In contrast to what is generally assumed for natural systems, the
   patterns show a distinct downward movement.}},

   previous reports that the IgG response to C. parvum is short-lived.
   There is also evidence that average antibody concentrations increase
   with age. Results suggest that the recombinant antigen may be a more
   sensitive method of measuring seroprevalence than the native antigen in
   Western blot. Although cross-sectional studies can provide an insight

Abstract = {{To delineate multiple myeloma (MM) subgroups and their clonal evolution,
   we analyzed 81 newly diagnosed patients by interphase fluorescence in
   situ hybridization using a comprehensive probe set for 10 chromosomes
   and two IGH rearrangements. A median of 5 probes per patient displayed
   aberrant signal numbers (range, 1-10). Additional copies most frequently
   found were for 15q22, 19q13, 9q34, 11q23, and 1q21. Losses commonly
   observed were of 13q 14.3, 17p 13, and 22q 11. Predominance of gain or
   loss was quantified by a copy number score (CS) for each patient. Two
   peaks (CS = +3 and CS = 0) were found by plotting patient copy number
   scores over CS values corresponding to hyperdiploid and nonhyperdiploid
   MM. Cluster analysis revealed four major branches: (i) gain of 9q, 15q,
   19q, and/or 11q; (ii) deletion of 13q and t(4; 14); (iii) t(11; 14); and
   (iv) gain of 1q. Statistical modeling of an oncogenetic tree indicated
   that early independent events were gain of 15q/9q and/or 11q, t(11; 14);
   deletion of 13q followed by t(4; 14); and gain of 1q. Aberrations of
   17p13, 22q11, 8p12, and 6q21 were found as subsequent events. MM with
   gain of I q was delineated as a subentity with significantly higher
   beta-2-microglobulin and lower hemoglobin levels, indicating a poor
   prognosis. From our results, we propose a model of MM for clonal
   evolution. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The quest continues for fire resistant composites that generate minimal
   smoke and toxic products. A major concern is the toxic components that
   are given off from composites containing halogens. The benefit of using
   Alumina Trihydtrate (ATH) to reduce the smoke and toxic components
   released from fiberglass composites has been well established. A
   non-halogenated polyester resin has been developed that meets many of
   the flame, smoke and toxicity requirements. This paper describes the
   first side-by-side detailed comparison of a halogenated and a
   non-halogenated ATH Filled system. ATH glass fiber reinforced composites
   are tested according to ASTM E 84 tunnel test for flame and smoke
   density, ASTM E 162 surface flammability, ASTM E 662 optical smoke
   density, ASTM E 1354 cone calorimeter, and BBS 7239 toxic gas test. The
   results of the flame, smoke and toxicity for both the halogenated and

   (\%CDT). SA was measured by an enzymatic method. There was no difference
   in the mean level of \%CDT between patients with IDA (2.26\%) and

Abstract = {{Purpose To evaluate the antitumor activity and tolerability of
   bevacizumab and doxorubicin in patients with metastatic soft-tissue
   sarcoma (STS).
   Patients and Methods Patients may have had up to one nonanthracycline
   line of therapy. Seventeen patients with metastatic STS were treated
   with doxorubicin at 75 mg/m(2) intravenous (IV) push followed by
   bevacizumab 15 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks. Dexrazoxane was started for total
   doxorubicin dose exceeding 300 mg/m(2).
   Results A total of 85 cycles of doxorubicin/bevacizumab were
   administered, median four cycles (range, one to 11), with three patients
   receiving one to four cycles of bevacizumab maintenance after reaching
   600 mg/m(2) doxorubicin. All 17 patients were assessable for response.
   Two partial responses (12\%, 95\% CI = 1\% to 36\%) were observed,
   lasting seven and 12 cycles of therapy. Eleven patients (65\%) had
   stable disease for four cycles or more. Six patients developed cardiac
   toxicity grade 2 or greater, with four patients grade 2 (cumulative
   doxorubicin 75, 150, 300, 300 mg/m(2), respectively), one grade 3 (total
   doxorubicin 591 mg/m(2)), and one grade 4 (total doxorubicin 420
   mg/m(2)). One patient with extensive lung disease died of recurrent
   bilateral pneumothoraces, possibly treatment-related.
   Conclusion The 12\% response rate for these patients was no greater than
   that observed for single-agent doxorubicin. However, the 65\% of
   patients with stable disease lasting four cycles or longer suggests
   further study is warranted in STSs. The observed cardiac toxicity,
   despite close monitoring and standard use of dexrazoxane, obliges a
   change in the dose and/or schedule in future studies of this
   combination.}},

Abstract = {{This article explores certain issues that arise at the borderline
   between conceptual analysis and metaphysics, where answers to questions
   of a conceptual nature compete with answers to questions of an
   ontological or metaphysical nature. I focus on the way in which three
   philosophers, Kant, Collingwood and Davidson, articulate the
   relationship between the conceptual question ``What are actions?{''} and
   the metaphysical question ``How is agency possible?{''} I argue that the
   way in which one handles the relationship between the conceptual and the
   ontological question has important implications for one's conception of
   the nature of philosophy, and that thinking hard about what it takes to
   defend the autonomy of the mental and of the agent-centred perspective
   should force us to think about our underlying conception of philosophy
   and to choose between one that understands it as first science and one
   that understands it as the underlabourer of science.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the present study was to elucidate the events that are
   involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and DNA damage
   after adrenergic receptors stimulation by cadmium, in relation to cAMP,
   protein kinase C (PKC) and Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE). Cadmium (50 mu M)
   caused increased levels of ROS with a concomitant increase in DNA damage
   in digestive gland of Mytilus galloprovincialis. Either the use of EIPA,
   a NHE blocker, or calphostin C, the inhibitor of PKC, reduced cadmium
   effects. Cells treated with alpha(1-), alpha(2-), beta(-) and beta(1-)
   adrenergic antagonists together with cadmium reversed cadmium alone
   effects, while the respective adrenergic agonists, phenylephrine and
   isoprenaline, mimic cadmium effects. Moreover, cadmium caused an
   increase in the levels of cAMP in digestive gland cells that were
   reversed after NHE and PKC inhibition as well as in the presence of each
   type of adrenergic antagonist. The different sensitivity of alpha(1-),
   alpha(2-), beta(-), beta(1-) adrenergic receptors on ROS, cAMP
   production and DNA damage possibly leads to the induction of two
   signaling pathways that may be interacting or to the presence of a
   compensatory pathway that acts in concert with the alpha(-) and
   beta-adrenergic receptors. In these signaling pathways PKC and NHE play
   significant role.}},

Abstract = {{The silkworm, Bombyx mori, has been recently demonstrated to contain a
   bacterial-type chitinase gene (BmChi-h) in addition to a
   well-characterized endochitinase gene (BmChitinase). The deduced amino
   acid sequence of BmChi-h showed extensive structural similarities with
   chitinases from bacteria such as Serratia marcescens chiA and
   baculoviruses (v-CHIA). Bacterial-type chitinase genes have not been
   found from any eukaryotes and viruses except for lepidopteran insects
   and lepidopteran baculoviruses. Thus, it was suggested that BmChi-h may
   be derived from a bacterial or baculovirus chitinase gene via horizontal
   gene transfer. In this report, we investigated the biological function
   of BmChi-h. Our enzymological study indicated that a chitinase encoded
   by BmChi-h has exo-type substrate preference, which is the same as S.
   marcescens chiA and v-CHIA, and different from BmChitinase, which has
   endo-type substrate preference. An immunohistochemical study revealed
   that BmChi-h localizes in the chitin-containing tissues during the
   molting stages, indicating that it plays a role in chitin degradation
   during molting. These results suggest that BmChi-h (exochitinase) and
   BmChitinase (endochitinase) may catalyze a native chitin by a concerted
   mechanism. Cloning and comparison of BmChi-h orthologues revealed that
   bacterial-type chitinase genes are highly conserved among lepidopteran
   insects, suggesting that the utilization of a bacterial-type chitinase
   during the molting process may be a general feature of lepidopteran
   insects. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present the first description of phylogeographic structure among
   Cuvier's beaked whales (Ziphius cavirostris) worldwide using
   mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences obtained from
   strandings (n = 70), incidental fisheries takes (n = 11), biopsy (n =
   1), and whale-meat markets (n = 5). Over a 290-base pair fragment, 23
   variable sites defined 33 unique haplotypes among the total of 87
   samples. Nucleotide diversity at the control region was relatively low
   (pi = 1.27\% +/- 0.723\%) compared to wide-ranging baleen whales, but
   higher than strongly matrifocal sperm, pilot and killer whales.
   Phylogenetic reconstruction using maximum likelihood revealed four
   distinct haplotype groups, each of which displayed strong frequency
   differences among ocean basins, but no reciprocal monophyly or fixed
   character differences. Consistent with this phylogeographic pattern, an
   analysis of molecular variance showed high levels of differentiation
   among ocean basins (F-ST = 0.14, Phi(ST) = 0.42; P < 0.001). Estimated
   rates of female migration among ocean basins were low (generally <= 2
   individuals per generation). Regional sample sizes were too small to
   detect subdivisions within oceans except in the North Atlantic, where
   the Mediterranean Sea (n = 12) was highly differentiated due to the
   presence of two private haplotypes. One market product purchased in
   South Korea grouped with other haplotypes found only in the North
   Atlantic, suggesting a violation of current agreements banning
   international trade in cetacean species. Together, these results
   demonstrate a high degree of isolation and low maternal gene flow among
   oceanic, and in some cases, regional populations of Cuvier's beaked
   whales. This has important implications for understanding the threats of
   human impact, including fisheries by-catch, direct hunting, and
   disturbance or mortality from anthropogenic sound.}},

Abstract = {{In Aspergillus niger, the genes coding for
   glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (gfaA) and
   alpha-1,3-glucan synthase (agsA) are induced in response to cell wall
   stress. In silico analysis of the promoter region of the two genes
   revealed the presence of putative DNA binding sites for transcription
   factors involved in stress responses, including sites identical to the
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rlm1p and Msn2p/Msn4p transcription factors.
   Promoter analysis indicated that the induction of the agsA gene in
   response to cell wall stress is fully dependent on a putative Rlm1p
   binding site in its promoter region. Database searches revealed the
   presence of S. cerevisiae Rlm1p homologues in most filamentous fungi
   examined, including A. niger. Deletion of the RLM1 homologue, named rlmA
   in A. niger, completely eliminated the induction of agsA and resulted in
   a twofold reduced induction of gfaA during Calcofluor White-induced cell
   wall stress. The rise in cell wall chitin in the presence of Calcofluor
   White was also affected in the rlmA deletion strain. In addition, the
   deletion strain was more sensitive towards cell wall stress agents. Our
   results indicate that A. niger responds to cell wall stress by
   transcriptional activation of cell wall reinforcing genes including agsA
   and gfaA through an Rlm1p-like transcription factor. We propose that
   such a cell wall salvage mechanism is wide spread in filamentous fungi.}},

Number = {{4, 1}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: There is a shortage of urologists specializing in female pelvic
   medicine and reconstructive surgery (FPMRS). We assessed the effects of
   an educational preceptorship program on the resident perception and
   desire to pursue careers in FPMRS.
   Materials and Methods: Between 2002 and 2004, 113 mid level residents
   from approximately 120 urology residency programs who were nominated by
   their respective program directors attended a 4-day course in FPMRS. The
   preceptorship course included live surgical FPMRS cases, didactic
   lectures, and discussions of research opportunities and career options.
   Participants in 2002 and 2003 evaluated the program content.
   Participants in 2004 completed a questionnaire to determine the effect
   of the course on their perception of FPMRS, and research and career
   opportunities in FPMRS.
   Results: In 2002 to 2004, 113 residents participated in the program. An
   informal survey of residency program directors showed that 10 of 36
   participants in 2002 had applied and enrolled in fellowship programs in
   FPMRS. Of the 32 of 40 participants in 2004 who completed the program
   evaluation 71\% stated that greater than 50\% of the material on female
   urology research was new to them and 90\% of participants stated that
   their interest in female urology was ``much higher to somewhat
   higher{''} as a result of the program.
   Conclusions: A preceptorship program in FPMRS incorporating in-depth
   review of the subject and demonstration of surgical cases has been
   successful in promoting and encouraging career selection in FPMRS. This
   approach may also encourage interest in other underrepresented
   subspecialties in urology or other medical specialties.}},

Journal = {{CHILD ABUSE \& NEGLECT}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this paper is to examine some of the factors that
   facilitate and hinder interagency collaboration between child protection
   services and mental health services in cases where there is a parent
   with a mental illness and there are protection concerns for the
   child(ren). The paper reports on agency practices, worker attitudes and
   experiences, and barriers to effective collaboration.
   Method: A self-administered, cross-sectional survey was developed and
   distributed via direct mail or via line supervisors to workers in
   statutory child protection services, adult mental health services, child
   and youth mental health services, and Suspected Child Abuse and Neglect
   (SCAN) Teams. There were 232 completed questionnaires returned, with an
   overall response rate of 21\%. Thirty-eight percent of respondents were
   statutory child protection workers. 39\% were adult mental health
   workers, 16\% were child and youth mental health workers, and 4\% were
   SCAN Team medical officers (with 3\% missing data).
   Results: Analysis revealed that workers were engaging in a moderate
   amount of interagency contact, but that they were unhappy with the
   support provided by their agency. Principle components analysis and
   multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) on items assessing attitudes
   toward other workers identified four factors, which differed in rates of
   endorsement: inadequate training, positive regard for child protection
   workers, positive regard for mental health workers, and mutual mistrust
   (from highest to lowest level of endorsement). The same procedure
   identified the relative endorsement of five factors extracted from items
   about potential barriers: inadequate resources, confidentiality, gaps in
   interagency processes, unrealistic expectations, and professional
   knowledge domains and boundaries.
   Conclusions: Mental health and child protection professionals believe
   that collaborative practice is necessary; however, their efforts are
   hindered by a lack of supportive structures and practices at the
   organizational level. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Organic farming is often considered beneficial for rural development
   through its role in alternative food chains, positive impact on
   landscapes and as an environmentally friendly production method.
   However, these need not be the only routes through which it can
   contribute to rural development. Results from an Austrian case study
   indicate that farmers also view organic farming as a way to disengage
   from commoditisation through a reorganization of on-farm resources. This
   allows farmers to move beyond the sole focus on production of raw
   materials for the food industry and undertake a wider variety of on-and
   off-farm activities. Conversion to organic farming could thus be a way
   of overcoming the shortcomings of the agricultural modernisation model,
   and implementing the rural development model proposed by the Wageningen
   School.}},

Abstract = {{An approach to knowledge-assisted semantic video object detection based
   on a multimedia ontology infrastructure is presented. Semantic concepts
   in the context of the examined domain are defined in an ontology,
   enriched with qualitative attributes (e.g., color homogeneity),
   low-level features (e.g., color model components distribution), object
   spatial relations, and multimedia processing methods (e.g., color
   clustering). Semantic Web technologies are used for knowledge
   representation in the RDF(S) metadata standard. Rules in F-logic are
   defined to describe how tools for multimedia analysis should be applied,
   depending on concept attributes and low-level features, for the
   detection of video objects corresponding to the semantic concepts
   defined in the ontology. This supports flexible and managed execution of
   various application and domain independent multimedia analysis tasks.
   Furthermore, this semantic analysis approach can be used in semantic
   annotation and transcoding systems, which take into consideration the
   users environment including preferences, devices used, available network
   bandwidth and content identity. The proposed approach was tested for the
   detection of semantic objects on video data of three different domains.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between specific antibody profiles and tuberculosis
   (TB) state was investigated by measuring serum antibody levels to six
   Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens in human subjects grouped into four
   diagnostic categories: active disease, inactive (past) tuberculosis,
   latent infection without radiographic chest abnormalities, and infection
   free. Statistical data analyses showed that the latter two groups were
   serologically indistinguishable and that active tuberculosis and
   inactive tuberculosis were characterized by different antibody profiles.
   Antibodies to the 38-kDa antigen, alanine dehydrogenase, and Rv2626c
   were associated with active TB, while antibodies to the 16-kDa antigen,
   ferredoxin A, and ESAT-6 were associated with inactive TB. Thus, the
   targets of the immune response vary with tuberculosis state. The
   correlation between bacterial antigen production and infection stage was
   investigated in mice infected with M. tuberculosis by bacterial
   transcription profiling. It was found that levels of transcripts
   encoding the six M. tuberculosis antigens varied during infection.
   Together, the data indicate that antigen composition of tubercle bacilli
   varies with stage of infection and that immunoprofiling can distinguish
   between tuberculosis states.}},

Title = {{Resource competition in contour hedgerow intercropping systems involving

Abstract = {{Tea (Camellia sinensis) in Sri Lanka is grown predominantly oil sloping
   highlands. Incorporating trees as hedgerows along contours is aimed at
   reducing erosion and improving soil fertility through addition of
   prunings as much. However, there could be significant competition for
   essential growth resources between the hedgerows and tea. The primary
   objective of this study was to determine the influence of six hedgerow
   species (Calliandra calothyrsits, Senna {[}Cassia] spectabilis,
   Eupatorium inulifolium, Flemingia congesia, Gliricidia sephun and
   Tithonia dirersifolia) on mature (6-year-old) and young (6-month-old)
   tea. This study had three on-farm, long-term (from Nov 1998 to Dec 2002)
   field experiments. Experiment I had 12 treatment combinations with the
   six shrub species and two mulching treatments (i.e. hedgerow prunings
   added to the tea plot as a mulch, and unmulched) oil mature tea plus a
   sole tea crop as control. The same was repeated oil Young tea in
   Experiment 2 to determine whether resource competition Oil Young tea was
   greater than that oil Mature tea. Experiment 3 examined the effects of
   removing free root competition oil tea by Cutting 1-m deep french
   between hedgerows and tea.
   In all experiments, total tea yields of hedgerow intercrops, cumulated
   over the 50-month experimental period, were significantly lower (by
   3-50\%) than sole tea crops, thus indicating significant resource
   competition except ill the Case Of Mulched hedgerow systems involving
   Eupatorium and Mature tea (18\% yield increase). Removal of below-ground
   competition significantly increased tea yields by 11-19\%. Addition of
   hedgerow prunings as a mulch significantly increased yields of both
   Mature and Young tea by 13-21 \%. Tea yields of hedgerow systems with
   Calliandra, Flemingia and Eupatiorium showed greater yield reductions
   ill Young tea than in mature tea, but the opposite was shown with other
   hedgerow species. There was a significant negative linear relationship
   between tea yield and pruned biomass of hedgerows. Tea yields of all
   experiments showed significant negative correlations,with several
   hedgerow characters, which are indicators of their competitive ability.
   These included hedgerow root density, canopy lateral spread, height and
   cross-section. In a majority of hedgerow systems, the available
   phosphorus content of topsoil (0-20 cm depth) was Lip to 51 \% lower
   compared to sole crops. It is concluded that incorporation of contour
   hedgerows in to all existing tea crop Could result in significant
   resource competition with tea and thereby Cause tea yield to decrease.
   However, there is scope For selection of hedgerow species that minimize
   competition through spatial and temporal complementarity with tea in
   resource capture.}},

Abstract = {{A novel square-root domain (SRD) second order filter with automatic

   cut-off frequency as well as the quality factor and gain of the filter.
   The basic building blocks of the complete system are implemented
   employing a design strategy based on the inherent nonlinear
   characteristic of Class-AB linear transconductors. A proper biasing
   scheme in such transconductors leads to operation with very low supply
   voltages (as low as V-GS + 2V(DSsat)). Simulation and numerical results
   together with measurements from a fabricated prototype in a 0.8-mu m
   CMOS technology are included in order to validate the design technique

Abstract = {{Aim. - To describe principles and characteristics of mental health care
   in London.
   Method. - Based on existing data, service provision, number of
   professionals working in services, funding arrangements, pathways into
   care, user/carer involvement and specific issues are reported.
   Results. - London experiences high levels of need and use of mental
   health services compared to England as a whole. Inpatient and compulsory
   admissions are considerably higher than the national average. Despite
   having more psychiatric beds and mental health staff, London has higher
   bed occupancy rates and staffing shortages. At the same time there is a
   trend away from institutionalised care to care in the community.
   Conclusion. - Mental health services in the UK are undergoing
   considerable reform. These changes will not remove the greater need for
   mental health services in the capital, but national policy and funding
   lends support to cross-agency and pan-London work to tackle some of the
   problems characteristic of mental health in London. Whilst various
   issues of mental health care in London overlap with those in other
   European capitals, there also are some specific problems and features.

Abstract = {{Background: Functional co-morbidities of excess body weight such as gait
   problems are never life-threatening like those associated with certain
   metabolic sequelae. Nevertheless, they may interfere with quality of
   life and also act as a mirror of muscle, bone and joint stress. In this
   prospective study, the goal was to document dynamic aspects of gait in
   severely obese subjects.
   Methods: An outpatient population (age 47.2 +/- 12.9 years, 94.1\%
   females, BMI 40.1 +/- 6.0 kg/m(2), n= 34) had their gait analyzed by an
   experienced physical therapist. Variables included speed, cadence,
   stride, support base and foot angle, which were compared to reference
   values for the Brazilian population.
   Results: All variables were significantly lower in the obese patients,
   except for support base which was increased. Speed was 73.3 +/- 16.3 vs
   130 cm/s, cadence was 1.4 +/- 0.2 vs 1.8 steps/s, stride was 106.8 +/-
   13.1 vs 132.0 cm, and support was 12.5 +/- 3.5 vs 10.0 cm (P < 0.05).
   Conclusions: 1) Widespread cinematic impairment was the rule in the
   studied population. 2) These findings are consistent with poor skeletal
   muscle performance, high metabolic expenditure and constant physical
   exhaustion. 3) Attention should be paid not only to the metabolic
   management but also to the physical rehabilitation required in cases of
   advanced obesity.}},

Abstract = {{Acid-base behaviour of a commercial sodium alginate extracted from brown
   seaweed (Macrocystis pyrifera) has been investigated at different ionic
   strengths (0. 1 <= I/mol l(-1)<= 1.0) and in different supporting
   electrolytes (Et4NI, NaCl, KCl, LiCl, NaCl+MgCl2), with the aim of
   examining the influence of ionic medium on the proton-binding capacity
   and of quantifying the strength of interaction with light metal ions in
   the perspective of speciation studies in natural aqueous systems.
   Potentiometric ({[}H+]glass electrode) and titration calorimetric data
   were expressed as a function of the dissociation degree (alpha) using
   different models (Henderson-Hasselbalch modified, Hogfeldt three
   parameters and linear equations). The dependence on ionic strength of
   the protonation constants was taken into account by a modified specific
   interaction theory model. Differences among different media were
   explained in terms of the interaction between polyanion and metal
   cations of the supporting electrolytes. Quantitative information on the
   proton-binding capacity, together with the stabilities of different
   species formed, is reported. Protonation thermodynamic parameters, at
   alpha=0.5, are log K-H= 3.686 +/- 0.005, Delta G(0)= 21.04 +/- 0.03 kJ
   mol(-1), Delta H-0=4.8 +/- 0.2 kJ mol(-1) and T Delta S-0=35.7 +/- 0.3
   kJ mol(-1), at infinite dilution. Protonation enthalpies indicate that
   the main contribution to proton binding arises from the entropy term. A
   strict correlation between Delta G and T Delta S was found, T Delta
   S=-9.51.73 Delta G. Results are reported in light of building up a
   chemical complexation model of general validity to explain the binding
   ability of naturally occurring polycarboxylate polymers and biopolymers.
   Speciation profiles of alginate in the presence of sodium and magnesium
   ions, naturally occurring cations in natural waters, are also reported.}},

   2005. First published May 18, 2005; doi:10.1152/ajpcell.00011.2005. - In
   the present study, we used laser scanning confocal microscopy in
   combination with fluorescent indicator dyes to investigate the effects
   of nitric oxide ( NO) produced endogenously by stimulation of the
   mitochondria-specific NO synthase (mtNOS) or applied exogenously through
   a NO donor, on mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, membrane potential, and gating
   of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) in permeabilized
   cultured calf pulmonary artery endothelial (CPAE) cells. Higher
   concentrations (100-500 mu M) of the NO donor spermine NONOate (Sper/NO)
   significantly reduced mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and Ca2+ extrusion
   rates, whereas low concentrations of Sper/NO (< 100 mu M) had no effect
   on mitochondrial Ca2+ levels ({[}Ca2+](mt)). Stimulation of
   mitochondrial NO production by incubating cells with 1 mM L-arginine
   also decreased mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, whereas inhibition of mtNOS
   with 10 mu M L-N-5-(1-iminoethyl) ornithine resulted in a significant
   increase of {[}Ca2+] mt. Sper/NO application caused a dose-dependent
   sustained mitochondrial depolarization as revealed with the
   voltage-sensitive dye tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester ( TMRE). Blocking
   mtNOS hyperpolarized basal mitochondrial membrane potential and
   partially prevented Ca2+-induced decrease in TMRE fluorescence. Higher
   concentrations of Sper/NO (100-500 mu M) induced PTP opening, whereas
   lower concentrations (< 100 mu M) had no effect. The data demonstrate
   that in calf pulmonary artery endothelial cells, stimulation of
   mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake can activate NO production in mitochondria
   that in turn can modulate mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and efflux,
   demonstrating a negative feedback regulation. This mechanism may be
   particularly important to protect against mitochondrial Ca2+ overload
   under pathological conditions where cellular {[} NO] can reach very high
   levels.}},

Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{2010-2022}},

Abstract = {{EU energy/environmental policy has at least two major and interrelated
   goals: to increase the percentage of electricity from renewable energy
   sources (RES-E) and to control the emission of GHG cost efficiently.
   These two goals could be in conflict. This paper explores one aspect of
   this conflicting relationship, namely the effect that the use of the
   Kyoto Protocol project mechanisms (CDM/JI project) may have on the
   deployment of RES-E within EU borders.
   The main conclusion is that, under certain assumptions (i.e., no
   mandatory EU RES-E quota), CDM/JI projects might reduce the incentive to
   deploy RES-E within EU borders because they would allow European power
   companies to comply with GHG targets in a cheaper way than if they
   reduced emissions by investing in renewable electricity in Europe. This
   is problematic, since many benefits from renewable electricity are local
   and these would be gone. This situation would be different if a
   mandatory RES-E quota (combined with an EU-wide TGC scheme) was
   implemented. In this case, the RES-E target would be fulfilled and
   CDM/JI projects would only affect RES-E deployment exceeding the target.

Abstract = {{Reiter's default logic is one of the best known and most studied of the
   approaches to nonmonotonic reasoning. Several variants of default logic
   have subsequently been proposed to give systems with properties
   differing from the original. In this paper, we examine the relationship
   between default logic and its major variants. We accomplish this by
   translating a default theory under a variant interpretation into a
   second default theory, under the original Reiter semantics, wherein the
   variant interpretation is respected. That is, in each case we show that,
   given an extension of a translated theory, one may extract an extension
   of the original variant default logic theory. We show how constrained,
   rational, justified, and cumulative default logic can be expressed in
   Reiter's default logic. As well, we show how Reiter's default logic can
   be expressed in rational default logic. From this, we suggest that any
   such variant can be similarly treated. Consequently, we provide a
   unification of default logics, showing how the original formulation of
   default logic may express its variants. Moreover, the translations
   clearly express the relationships between alternative approaches to
   default logic. The translations themselves are shown to generally have
   good properties. Thus, in at least a theoretical sense, we show that
   these variants are in a sense superfluous, in that for any of these
   variants of default logic, we can exactly mimic the behaviour of a
   variant in standard default logic. As well, the translations lend
   insight into means of classifying the expressive power of default logic
   variants; specifically we suggest that the property of semi-monotonicity
   represents a division with respect to expressibility, whereas regularity
   and cumulativity do not.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: We report the use of bilateral thalamic
   stimulation in a case of primary erythromelalgia with immediate and
   important pain relief for 3 years.
   CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 12-year-old boy experiencing primary
   erythromelalgia had a 4-year history of recurrent attacks of severe
   burning pain in both feet, accompanied by local reddening, swelling, and
   heating of the skin. The attacks were triggered by warmth and exercise.
   The pain was relieved only by elevation and cooling of the lower limbs,
   which he achieved by immersing his legs in a bucket of ice water,
   resulting in severe ulceration of the skin.
   INTERVENTION: Because of the gradual aggravation of the signs and
   symptoms and resistance of the patient's condition to several medical
   therapies, the patient received spinal cord stimulation. The implants
   were removed twice because of recurrent infection. Finally, the patient
   was treated with bilateral electrical stimulation of the ventral
   posterolateral thalamic nucleus, which resulted in important pain
   control until 3 years later. The patient was able to avoid water
   immersions, and all ulcerations disappeared.
   CONCLUSION: We conclude that thalamic stimulation was successful in this
   case of primary erythromelalgia.}},

Abstract = {{Background Angiotensin 11 causes hypertension not only by direct
   constriction of vascular smooth muscle, but also by facilitating the
   release of noradrenaline from sympathetic terminals and by enhancing
   vascular noradrenaline sensitivity. AT, receptor antagonists attenuate
   all these actions, but display some evidence of substance-related
   selectivities.
   Objective The contribution of pre- or postsynaptic impairment of
   sympathetic transmission to long-term antihypertensive efficacy should
   be determined for four structurally different, clinically approved AT,
   antagonists.
   Design Spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated with candesartan,
   eprosartan, irbesartan, or losartan via osmotic minipumps for 4 weeks at
   doses yielding identical reductions of blood pressure. Maximum efficacy
   was obtained with a tripled dose of candesartan.
   Methods In the pithed rat model, stimulus/response dependencies were
   determined for vasopressor effectivity of preganglionic electrical
   stimulation, and of intravenous bolus applications of noradrenaline and
   angiotensin II.
   Results Losartan, irbesartan, eprosartan, and candesartan at doses of 5,
   40, 20, and 0.05 mg/kg per day, were equally effective in reducing basal
   systolic blood pressure (-42 mmHg), and the vasopressor potency of
   angiotensin 11 (approximately 10-fold). The efficacies of preganglionic
   stimulation and exogenous noradrenaline were unaltered, with the
   exception of irbesartan, which reduced vascular noradrenaline
   sensitivity. The tripled dose of candesartan further reduced basal and
   angiotensin II-stimulated blood. pressures, and significantly attenuated
   vascular noradrenaline sensitivity.
   Conclusion AT, antagonists at doses that effectively reduce blood
   pressure in chronic therapy do not generally suppress peripheral
   sympathetic function. A potential interaction consists in a reduction of
   vascular noradrenaline sensitivity, which can be considered as a class
   effect of AT, antagonists at high dosage. J Hypertens 23:1861 -1867 (c)

Title = {{Anatomy of handedness and the laterality of seizure onset: surgical
   implications of new understandings in motor control}},
Journal = {{NEUROLOGICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{773-779}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: This article pursues another corollary of the anatomy of
   handedness, a code for the laterality of motor control. The latter
   indicates the absence of any motor communication from the minor (right,
   in the vast majority of population) to the major hemisphere (left, in
   the vast majority of right handers). It also indicates that all
   communications between the two hemispheres are excitatory in nature.
   This arrangement prohibits initiation of seizure within the minor and
   its propagation to the major hemisphere, via the callosum.
   Methods: A comprehensive review of the literature is undertaken
   regarding theoretical and technical reasons for the failure of seizure
   surgery in subjects undergoing the same for intractable epilepsy.
   Results: Whereas the laterality of motor control is heavily biased
   towards the left hemisphere (- 80\%), the operation is performed equally
   on both hemispheres. Failures of surgery in some series were
   substantially higher among those who had undergone operations on the
   right hemisphere. Technical reasons for this are traced to the
   unreliability of tests commonly employed in securing laterality of
   seizure onset, which is the same as that of motor control. Accordingly,
   the failure rate of seizure surgery may equal the rate of false
   lateralization of the major hemisphere in these circumstances.
   Conclusion: Given the dichtomous anatomy of handedness, the most robust
   test for lateralizing the hemisphere of onset of seizure is that of
   determining the reaction times of two symmetrically located effecters,
   one on each side of the body. The side with the shorter reaction time
   will always be opposite to the major hemisphere. the difference between
   the two values is commensurate to the inter-hemispheric transfer time.}},

Abstract = {{The European quail is a partial migrant bird considered `vulnerable' by
   the European community. The decline of this subspecies has spurred an
   annual release of large numbers of domestic Japanese quail. Prezygotic
   and postzygotic isolating mechanisms have not been established between
   these two subspecies, enhancing the risk of hybridization. In addition,
   anecdotal reports suggest that hybridization is commonly practiced in
   game farms of domestic quails. In this article, we present the results
   of behavioural characterization of the quails produced by two European
   game farms: one French and one Italian. First, we looked for evidences
   of hybridization in both game farms. Using actographic methods, we
   measured migratory tendency. Birds, hatched in summer, were submitted in
   autumn to an artificial increase of daylength (LD 14:10) for 60 days. In
   quails, the length of the cloacal vent which is a good indicator of
   sexual development, was monitored every 10 days. We noted the appearance
   of cloacal foam in males and egg-laying activity in females. In
   addition, mating calls produced by the males when sexually mature were
   recorded and analyzed using spectrographic methods. Seventeen males of
   27 from the French game farm exhibited nocturnal restlessness. Most of
   the birds of the Italian game farm (40/44) developed sexually without
   showing any migratory activity. Since Japanese quail has lost its
   migratory impulse during the domestication process, the presence of
   migratory activity in quails of both game farms clearly demonstrated the
   introduction of wild European quail. Spectrographic analysis of male
   mating calls confirmed this assumption: some males in both game farms
   (21/27 in the French game farm, 5/22 in the Italian game farm) produced
   calls similar to those produced by control lines of hybrid quails
   (Japanese x European). In an additional experiment, we report the
   results of encounters between males of the French game farm and males of
   European quail. One bird of each strain were put together on day I and
   on day 3, we introduced in the pen a female European quail. In I I cases
   out of 11, the male of the French game farm dominated the male European
   quail and monopolized the female. These results imply that releasing
   hybrid and Japanese quails in the wild could rapidly lead to widespread
   genetic pollution of the western Palaearctic populations of the European
   quail. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding of the flow of fluids through beds of fibrous media is
   extremely important for composites processing. In this work, we have
   investigated a steady flow of a Newtonian fluid through two-dimensional
   porous media using lattice Boltzmann methods. The porous domains studied
   in this work represent different types of porous media encountered in
   composite processing. Initially, the methodology was validated with a
   simulation of flow through random porous media. Flow through porous
   media with circular and elliptical inclusions was simulated with
   different geometric arrangements. Simulations were also carried out with
   anisotropic porous media. The permeability was estimated as a function
   of porosity, geometric arrangements and the degree of anisotropy. The
   simulation results agree well with those from analytical, empirical and
   experimental studies. The results demonstrate that such a method will be
   very useful in simulating composite processing.}},

Abstract = {{The use of LiN(SO2CF3)(2) as salt in lithium-ion secondary cells was
   considered to be a promising alternative to LiPF6 salt. However, in
   practice this salt has never been used in rechargeable batteries due to
   the severe corrosion it causes to the aluminium current collector. The
   spinel Li4Ti5O12 has been a focus of attention for the major battery
   manufacturers as an alternative material for anodes instead of graphite;
   for cells employing this material, new electrolyte compositions can be
   considered which solve the corrosion problem and allow the use of
   imide-type salts. This work reports electrochemical studies
   characterizing the corrosion of aluminium electrodes polarized at high
   voltages in aprotic solvents containing LiSO3CF3 (LiTf) or
   LiN(SO2CF3)(2) (LiTFSI) or LiN(SO2C2F5)(2) (LiBETI) salts. Despite the
   observation that in common battery solvents LiTFSI causes severe
   corrosion of the aluminium current collector at potential around 3.7 V
   (vs. Li), solvents having a cyano-group showed a repassivation potential
   (E-R) around 4.15 V (vs. Li). Based on the experimental observations
   made and previous literature reports, a mechanism to explain the
   inhibiting properties of nitriles is proposed. The nitrile-based
   electrolytes allow the final usage of LiTFSI in commercial batteries
   using LiCO2 as cathodic material on aluminium current collectors. (c)

Abstract = {{Glucocorticoids secreted in response to stress activation of the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis feed back onto the brain to rapidly
   suppress neuroendocrine activation, including oxytocin and vasopressin
   secretion. Here we show using whole-cell patch clamp recordings that
   glucocorticoids elicit a rapid, opposing action on synaptic glutamate
   and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release onto magnocellular neurons of
   the hypothalamic supraoptic nucleus and paraventricular nucleus,
   suppressing glutamate release and facilitating GABA release by
   activating a putative membrane receptor. The glucocorticoid effect on
   both glutamate and GABA release was blocked by inhibiting postsynaptic G
   protein activity, suggesting a dependence on postsynaptic G protein
   signaling and the involvement of a retrograde messenger. Biochemical
   analysis of hypothalamic slices treated with dexamethasone revealed a
   glucocorticoid-induced rapid increase in the levels of the
   endocannabinoids anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). The
   glucocorticoid suppression of glutamate release was blocked by the type
   I cannabinoid receptor cannabinoid receptor antagonist, AM251, and was
   mimicked and occluded by AEA and 2-AG, suggesting it was mediated by
   retrograde endocannabinoid release. The glucocorticoid facilitation of
   GABA release was also blocked by AM251 but was not mimicked by AEA,
   2-AG, or a synthetic cannabinoid, WIN 55,212-2, nor was it blocked by
   vanilloid or ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists, suggesting that
   it was mediated by a retrograde messenger acting at an AM251-sensitive,
   noncannabinoid/nonvanilloid receptor at presynaptic GABA terminals. The
   combined, opposing actions of glucocorticoids mediate a rapid inhibition
   of the magnocellular neuroendocrine cells, which in turn should mediate
   rapid feedback inhibition of the secretion of oxytocin and vasopressin
   by glucocorticoids during stress activation of the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.}},

Abstract = {{An extensive survey of the ectoparasites infesting bats in Paraguay
   provides information regarding the taxonomy and host distribution of
   streblid bat flies at a geographic interface between subtropical and
   temperate habitats. Five families of bats representing 45 species,
   including Molossidae (5 genera and 15 species), Natalidae (1 genus and 1
   species), Phyllostomidae (11 genera and 15 species), Noctilionidae (1
   genus and 2 species), and Vespertilionidae (4 genera and 12 species)
   were collected from 24 localities across Paraguay and sampled for
   ectoparasites. In total, 2,467 bat flies were collected, representing 11
   genera and 31 nominal species of Streblidae, of which 6 genera and 24
   species are new records for Paraguay. No streblids were collected from
   vespertilionid bats; 23 species infested phyllostomids, 6 species
   noctilionids, 1 species a natalid, and I species molossids. Streblid bat
   flies were highly specific to certain host groups and individual host
   species, and their geographic distributions closely followed those of
   their host bats. Of 31 streblid species surveyed, 27 were monoxenous
   (i.e., associated with a single host species), and 4 were stenoxenous
   (i.e., associated with a group of phylogenetically related hosts). The
   number of streblid species is greatly reduced in the Chaco region west
   of the Paraguay River, largely because of the lack of phyllostomid host
   bats.}},

Abstract = {{Early life-stage tests over 21 days were performed with zebrafish
   (origin group 1), environmentally relevant concentrations of the
   genotoxicant benzo{[}a]pyrene (BaP), and the solvent dimethylsulfoxide
   (DMSO). As survival did not correspond to BaP or DMSO, zebrafish from
   another origin (group 2) were compared with group 1 fish. The outcome
   was that survival in group 1 fish varied from 26 to 84\%, whereas
   survival in group 2 fish was at least 94\% and not affected by either of
   the two chemicals. This result is likely to be caused by endogenous
   factor(s) in group 1 fish. The study supports the need for establishing
   a reliable zebrafish culture prior to toxicity testing.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess transfusion
   requirements in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with and without
   autologous blood donation and to calculate the costs of predonation from
   the hospital perspective.
   Design: Observational study.
   Setting: Single university hospital.
   Participants: Four thousand three hundred twenty-five patients
   undergoing elective cardiac surgery with and without autologous blood
   donation.
   Interventions: Eight hundred forty-nine patients (20\%) underwent
   autologous blood donation, whereas 3,476 (80\%) did not. Perioperative
   allogeneic blood transfusion was recorded as the primary endpoint. To
   avoid selection bias, patients were stratified according to their
   preoperative risk score. A decision model was derived from acquired data
   for the optimization of autologous blood donation.
   Measurements and Main Results: Allogeneic blood transfusion rate was
   13\% in patients with predonation versus 48\% without preclonation (p <
   0.05). This difference remained statistically significant even after
   risk stratification. The predonation of 1, 2, or 3 units reduced the
   probability of receiving allogeneic blood to 24\%, 14\%, and 9\%,
   respectively. An efficient program of predonation within the department
   of anesthesiology allowed keeping the costs of predonation low.
   Decision-tree analysis revealed that predonation of 2 autologous units
   of blood saved the most allogeneic blood for the smallest increase in
   costs. Incremental cost for male patients predonating 2 units was \$33
   (US), whereas for females predonation could be done at no extra cost in
   comparison to patients without predonation.
   Conclusion: Autologous blood donation significantly reduces allogeneic
   blood requirement in cardiac surgery. If adjusted for diagnosis and
   gender, autologous blood donation is a cost-effective alternative to
   reduce allogeneic blood consumption. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Two-phase pressure drop in a narrow horizontal annular test section was
   experimentally investigated, using air and water as the working fluids.
   The annular test section had inner and outer diameters of 7.93 min and
   9.53 mm, respectively. In one group of tests (constant quality tests)
   air and water were mixed before entering the test section. In another
   group (variable quality tests), gas was injected into the test section
   via the porous inner test section wall. The liquid Reynolds number
   varied in the Re-L = 50-9000 range, and the test section exit qualities
   covered the 0-25\% range. The measured total pressure drops were
   compared with the predictions of a one-dimensional model with several
   two-phase frictional pressure drop correlations. The pressure variations
   caused by flow acceleration were calculated based on the homogeneous
   flow assumption. The correlation of Beattie and Whalley {[}D.R.H.
   Beattie, P.B. Whalley, A simplified two-phase frictional pressure drop
   prediction method, Int. J. Multiphase Flow 18 (1982) 83-87] agreed
   reasonably well with results of both groups of tests.
   The effect of lateral mechanical vibrations, imposed at the center of
   the test section, on two-phase pressure drop was also studied, with
   vibration amplitudes in the 0.034-0.2 mm range, and frequencies in the
   range 5-400 Hz. These effects were generally small. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Volume = {{96}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims New maize (Zea mays) hybrids outperformed old ones
   even at reduced N rates. Understanding the mechanisms of the differences
   in performance between newer and older hybrids under N deficiency could
   provide avenues for breeding maize cultivars with large yield under N
   deficiency, and reduce environmental pollution caused by N fertilizers.
   Methods N deficiency effects on grain weight, plant weight, harvest
   index, leaf area and photosynthetic traits were studied in the field for
   six maize hybrids released during the past 50 years to compare their
   tolerance and to explore their physiological mechanisms.
   Key Results N deficiency decreased grain yield and plant weight in all
   hybrids, especially in the older hybrids. However, there was no
   significant difference in harvest index, rate of light-saturated
   photosynthesis (P-sat) 20 d before flowering, leaf area or plant weight
   at flowering between the N-deficient and control plants of all hybrids.
   Dry matter production after flowering of the N-deficient plants was
   significantly lower than that of the control plants in all hybrids,
   especially in the older hybrids, and was mostly due to differences in
   the rate of decrease in photosynthetic capacity during this stage. The
   lower P-sat of the older hybrids was not due to stomatal limitation, as
   there was no significant difference in stomatal conductance (g(s)) and
   intercellular CO2 concentration (C-i) between the hybrids. N deficiency
   accelerated senescence, i.e. decreased chlorophyll and soluble protein
   contents, after anthesis more for the earlier released hybrids than for
   the later ones. N deficiency decreased phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase
   (PEPCase) activity significantly more in older hybrids than newer
   hybrids, and affected the maximal efficiency of PSII photochemistry
   (Fv/Fm) only in the old hybrids and at the late stage.
   Conclusions Compared with older (earlier released) hybrids, newer (later
   released) hybrids maintained greater plant and grain weight under N
   deficiency because their photosynthetic capacity decreased more slowly
   after anthesis, associated with smaller non-stomatal limitations due to
   maintenance of PEPCase activity, and chlorophyll and soluble protein
   content.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental infection of hamsters with Punta Toro virus (PTV) produces
   a disease with clinical and pathological similarities to the severe
   human hemorrhagic fever caused by Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), thus
   providing an animal model for RVFV pathogenesis. In this model,
   hepatocytic apoptosis is the main pathological component of liver
   injuries that are responsible for severe hemorrhagic manifestations. To
   further elucidate whether viral replication in hepatocytes directly
   causes apoptosis, we studied the morphological and biochemical changes
   of apoptosis in HepG2 cells at different time points after PTV
   infection. Cellular viability began to decrease 12 hours after infection
   compared with controls. Caspases 3/7 were activated significantly at 48
   and 72 hours after infection, and phosphatidylserine translocation and
   DNA fragmentation were also detected at 48 and 72 hours. Cell cycle
   analysis by flow cytometry showed that infected HepG2 cells were
   arrested at G(0)/G(1), phase. Furthermore, virus titer increased with
   apoptosis progression, suggesting that viral replication is necessary
   for the apoptotic process. These results indicate that PTV infection
   alone, without a secondary inflammatory cellular reaction, induces
   hepatocytic apoptosis and suggest that future therapeutics for RVFV
   hemorrhagic disease might target inhibition of cellular apoptotic
   pathways during the acute infection.}},

Abstract = {{The contact hypothesis proposes that interaction between members of
   different groups reduces intergroup prejudice if and only if-certain
   optimal conditions are present. For over 50 years, research using this
   framework has explored the boundary conditions for ideal contact and has
   guided interventions to promote desegregation. Although supporting the
   contact hypothesis in principle, the authors critique some research
   practices that have come to dominate the field: (a) the prioritizing of
   the study of interactions occurring under rarefied conditions, (b) the
   reformulation of lay understandings of contact in terms of a generic
   typology of ideal dimensions, and (c) the use of shifts in personal
   prejudice as the primary measure of outcome. The authors argue that
   these practices have limited the contact hypothesis both as an
   explanation of the intergroup dynamics of desegregation and as a
   framework for promoting social psychological change. In so arguing, the
   authors look toward a complementary program of research on contact and
   desegregation.}},

Abstract = {{Where the creation, understanding, and assessment of software testing
   and regression testing techniques are concerned, controlled
   experimentation is an indispensable research methodology. Obtaining the
   infrastructure necessary to support such experimentation, however, is
   difficult and expensive. As a result, progress in experimentation with
   testing techniques has been slow, and empirical data on the costs and
   effectiveness of techniques remains relatively scarce. To help address
   this problem, we have been designing and constructing infrastructure to
   support controlled experimentation with testing and regression testing
   techniques. This paper reports on the challenges faced by researchers
   experimenting with testing techniques, including those that inform the
   design of our infrastructure. The paper then describes the
   infrastructure that we are creating in response to these challenges, and
   that we are now making available to other researchers, and discusses the
   impact that this infrastructure has had and can be expected to have.}},

Abstract = {{Carnosine, a specific constituent of excitable tissues of vertebrates,
   exhibits a significant antioxidant protecting effect on the brain
   damaged by ischemic-reperfusion injury when it was administered to the

   intraperitoneally (100 mg/kg body weight) after ischemic episode induced
   by experimental global brain ischemia. Treatment of the animals with
   carnosine after ischemic episode under long-term (7-14 days) reperfusion
   demonstrated its pronounced protective effect on neurological symptoms
   and animal mortality. Carnosine also prevented higher lipid peroxidation
   of brain membrane structures and increased a resistance of neuronal
   membranes to the in vitro induced oxidation. Measurements of malonyl
   dialdehyde (MDA) in brain homogenates showed its increase in the after
   brain stroke animals and decreased MDA level in the after brain stroke
   animals treated with carnosine. We concluded that carnosine compensates
   deficit in antioxidant defense system of brain damaged by ischemic
   injury. The data presented demonstrate that carnosine is effective in
   protecting the brain in the post-ischemic period.}},

Abstract = {{Mixed convection heat transfer in a top and bottom heated rectangular
   channel with discrete heat sources has been investigated experimentally
   for air. The lower and upper surfaces of the channel were equipped with
   8 X 4 flush-mounted heat sources subjected to uniform heat flux.
   Sidewalls, the lower and upper walls were insulated and adiabatic. The
   experimental study was made for an aspect ratio of AR=6, Reynolds
   numbers 955 <= Re-Dh <= 2220 and modified Grashof numbers Gr{*} = 1.7 X
   10(7) to 6.7 x 10(7). From experimental measurements, surface
   temperature and Nusselt number distributions of the discrete heat
   sources were obtained for different Grashof numbers. Furthermore,
   Nusselt number distributions were calculated for different Reynolds
   numbers. Results show that surface temperatures increase with increasing
   Grashof number. The row-averaged Nusselt numbers first decrease with the
   row number and then, due to the increase in the buoyancy affected
   secondary flow and the onset of instability, they show an increase
   towards the exit as a result of heat transfer enhancement. (c) 2005

   retrospective manner 300 patients who did not perform hysteroscopy.
   Results. One-hundred-and-eighty (60\%) hysteroscopies were normal but
   120 (40\%) revealed an unsuspected intrauterine abnormality. We did not
   find statistically significant differences between patients with normal
   or abnormal hysteroscopy in any characteristic. We found a statistically
   significant difference in pregnancy rate between women who performed
   hysteroscopy before IVF-ET cycle and in women who did not perform it.
   Conclusions. Hysteroscopy, as a routine examination, should be performed
   before the first IVF-ET cycle in all patients.}},

Abstract = {{Objective-To evaluate risk factors associated with development of
   catheter-associated jugular thrombophlebitis in hospitalized horses.
   Design-Retrospective case-control study.
   Animals-50 horses with thrombophlebitis and 100 control horses.
   Procedure-Medical records from 1993 through 1998 were searched for
   horses with thrombophlebitis. Horses that were hospitalized for at least
   5 days, had an IV catheter placed in a jugular vein (other than for
   solely anesthetic purposes), and had no evidence of thrombophlebitis
   during admission or hospitalization were chosen as controls. Signalment,
   history, clinicopathologic findings, primary illness, and treatment were
   obtained from the medical records. Data were analyzed by use of logistic
   regression to perform univariate and multivariate analyses.
   Results-For a horse with endotoxemia, the odds of developing
   thrombophlebitis were 18 times those for a similar horse without
   endotoxemia. For a horse with salmonellosis, the odds of developing
   thrombophlebitis were 68 times those for a similar horse without
   salmonellosis. For a horse with hypoproteinemia, the odds of developing
   thrombophlebitis were almost 5 times those for a similar horse without
   hypoproteinemia. For a horse in the medicine section, the odds of
   developing thrombophlebitis were 16 times those for a similar horse in
   the surgery section. For a horse with large intestinal disease, the odds
   of developing thrombophlebitis were 4 times those for a similar horse
   without large intestinal disease. For a horse receiving antidiarrheal or
   antiulcerative medications, the odds of developing thrombophlebitis were
   31 times those for a similar horse not receiving these medications.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results indicated that patient
   factors, including large intestinal disease, hypoproteinemia,
   salmonellosis, and endotoxemia, were associated with development of
   catheter-associated thrombophlebitis in horses.}},

Abstract = {{The absorption of hand-transmitted vibration energy may be an
   etiological factor in vibration-induced disorders. The vibration power
   absorption density (VPAD) may be a better measure of energy than the
   total power absorption of the hand-arm system. The objectives of the
   present study are to develop a method to estimate the average absorption
   density in the fingers and to investigate its basic characteristics. Ten
   healthy male subjects were used in this study. The biodynamic response
   of the fingers in a power grip subjected to a broad-band random
   excitation was measured under three grip forces (15, 30, 50 N) and three
   push forces (35, 45, 50 N). The response was used to estimate the total
   finger energy absorption. The response, together with the finger volume,
   was also used to estimate the amount of tissue effectively involved in
   the absorption. Then, the average VPAD under constant-acceleration,
   constant-power density, constant-velocity vibration spectra, and 20 tool
   vibration spectra were calculated. The correlations between the VPAD and
   the unweighted and weighted accelerations (ISO 5349-1, 2001) were also
   examined. The VPAD depends on both the characteristics of the vibration
   spectrum and the biodynamic response of the finger-hand-arm system. The
   biodynamic response generally plays a more important role in determining
   the VPAD in the middle frequency range (31.5-400 Hz) than those at the
   low and high ends. The applied force significantly affected the VPAD.
   The finger VPAD was highly correlated to the unweighted acceleration.
   The average VPAD can be determined using the proposed experimental
   method. It can serve as an alternative tool to quantify the severity of
   the vibration exposure for studying vibration-induced finger disorders.}},

Title = {{Methadone doses of 100 mg or greater are more effective than lower doses
   at suppressing heroin self-administration in opioid-dependent volunteers}},

Abstract = {{Aims Methadone maintenance has been an effective pharmacotherapy for the
   treatment of heroin dependence for nearly four decades. Recent clinical
   research suggests that methadone doses larger than those used in most
   clinics are more effective at suppressing illicit heroin use. This
   greater efficacy may result from greater cross-tolerance to the
   reinforcing effects of heroin.
   Design The purpose of this double-blind, within-subject study was to
   examine the relationship between methadone maintenance dose and the
   reinforcing effects of heroin.
   Setting Participants were stabilized on 50, 100 and 150 mg methadone
   (ascending order) during separate outpatient periods before being
   admitted to an inpatient research unit for testing at each maintenance
   dose.
   Participants Five opiate-dependent volunteers completed the study.
   Measurements During each 4-week inpatient testing period, participants
   sampled three doses of heroin (0, 10, or 20 mg; random order; one dose
   per week) and were subsequently allowed seven opportunities to choose
   between another injection of that week's heroin dose and varying amounts
   of money (\$2-38).
   Findings The number of heroin injections chosen decreased as methadone
   dose was increased. Larger alternative monetary reinforcers were
   required to suppress heroin self-administration during maintenance on 50
   compared to 100 or 150 mg methadone. Larger methadone doses also
   completely blocked the subjective effects of heroin and produced greater
   withdrawal suppression during the outpatient periods.
   Conclusions These results support other clinical and laboratory-based
   research indicating that persistent heroin use may be reduced by
   providing larger methadone maintenance doses that produce more effective
   cross-tolerance to heroin.}},

Abstract = {{Although Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is transmitted by the faecal-oral
   route, its target for replication is the liver. Little is known of its
   interactions with cells of the gastrointestinal tract, and it is not
   known by which mechanisms HAV crosses the intestinal epithelium. In this
   study, it is shown that HAV associated with IgA is translocated from the
   apical to the basolateral compartment of polarized epithelial cells via
   the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor by IgA-mediated reverse
   transcytosis. The relevance of this mechanism, by which HAV-IgA
   complexes may overcome the intestinal barrier and contribute to
   infections of the liver, results from the fact that HAV-IgA complexes
   are infectious for hepatocytes and that significant amounts of
   intestinal HAV-IgA are present during acute infections, which are also
   partly transmitted. Besides supporting the primary infection, this
   mechanism may play a role in relapsing infections by establishing an
   enterohepatic cycle for HAV.}},

Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Flue gas generated by combustion of natural gas in a boiler was used for
   outdoor cultivation of Chlorella sp. in a 55 m(2) culture area
   photobioreactor. A 6 mm thick layer of algal suspension continuously
   running down the inclined lanes of the bioreactor at 50 cm s(-1) was
   exposed to sunlight. Flue gas containing 6-8\% by volume of CO2
   substituted for more costly pure CO2 as a source of carbon for
   autotrophic growth of algae. The degree of CO2 mitigation (flue gas
   decarbonization) in the algal suspension was 10-50\% and decreased with
   increasing flue gas injection rate into the culture. A dissolved CO2
   partial pressure (pCO(2)) higher than 0.1 kPa was maintained in the
   suspension at the end of the 50 m long culture area in order to prevent
   limitation of algal growth by CO2. NOX and CO gases (up to 45 mg m(-3)
   NOX and 3 mg m(-3) CO in flue gas) had no negative influence on the
   growth of the alga. On summer days the following daily net
   productivities of algae {[}g (dry weight) m(-2)] were attained in
   comparative parallel cultures: flue gas = 19.4-22.8; pure CO2 =
   19.1-22.6. Net utilization (eta) of the photosynthetically active
   radiant (PAR) energy was: flue gas = 5.58-6.94\%; pure CO2 =
   5.49-6.88\%. The mass balance of CO2 obtained for the flue gas stream
   and for the algal suspension was included in a mathematical model, which
   permitted the calculation of optimum flue gas injection rate into the
   photobioreactor, dependent on the time course of irradiance and culture
   temperature. It was estimated that about 50\% of flue gas
   decarbonization can be attained in the photobioreactor and 4.4 kg of CO2
   is needed for production of 1 kg (dry weight) algal biomass. A scheme of
   a combined process of farm unit size is proposed; this includes
   anaerobic digestion of organic agricultural wastes, production and
   combustion of biogas, and utilization of flue gas for production of
   microalgal biomass, which could be used in animal feeds. A preliminary
   quantitative assessment of the microalgae production is presented.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to describe our rate of extrusion of

   January 2000 to 31 August 2003 was performed. Demographics, medical
   history, and follow-up were evaluated. For subjects who developed an
   extrusion, treatment details were recorded. Sixty-nine subjects
   underwent colporrhaphy using dermal allograft material during the
   defined time period: 21 anterior, 45 posterior, and 3 both. Five
   subjects did not appear for follow-up. Seven subjects (10.9\%) developed
   an extrusion: three subjects anteriorly and four subjects posteriorly.
   There were no differences between subjects with and without extrusions
   based on recorded risk factors. Median time to the discovery of
   extrusion was 4 weeks (range: 1-6 weeks). All patients were managed with
   estrogen vaginal cream. Median documented healing time was 13 weeks
   (range: 5-40 weeks), and no serious morbidity was encountered. Graft
   extrusion is an uncommon complication when reinforcing vaginal tissue
   with dermal allograft material and can be safely and effectively managed
   with vaginal estrogen and expectant management.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known as to what happens to people with Huntington's disease
   (HD) at the end of life. Exploratory analysis was performed for all
   admissions of people with HD in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample
   database, a 20\% stratified sample of all US hospitalizations, from 1996
   to 2002. Using the principal diagnosis and procedure, admission cohorts
   were determined. The common HD-associated reasons for admission were
   pneumonia (including aspiration, 22\%), psychiatric (21.5\%),
   debilitation (hypovolemia, nutritional deficiencies, and decubitus
   ulcers, 15.5\%), trauma (5.7\%), and nonpulmonary infections (urinary
   tract infections and sepsis, 11\%). Twenty-two percent were admitted for
   medical problems unrelated to HD. Emergency departments were the most
   frequent source of admission (60\%), most had Medicare or Medicaid as
   the expected payer (80.6\%), 54.4\% of all admissions were discharged to
   long-term care facilities (LTCFs), and 3.7\% died. The highest mortality
   was seen in the pneumonia (7.68\%) and sepsis (7.39\%) cohorts. Of the
   elective admissions, between 49.71\% and 60.31\% were discharged to
   LTCFs, representing new LTCF admissions. Based on this exploratory
   analysis, hospitalized HD patients are admitted late in the course of
   their illness, are severely disabled, and are commonly discharged to
   LTCFs. With 60.31\% of the discharges representing new LTCF admissions,
   this finding shows that there is no going home from the hospital for

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of gear
   ratio (GR) and thus crank inertial load (CIL), on the activity levels of
   lower limb muscles. Twelve competitive cyclists performed three
   randomised trials with their own bicycle equipped with a SRM crankset
   and mounted on an Axiom ergometer. The power output (similar to 80\% of
   maximal aerobic power) and the pedalling cadence were kept constant for
   each subject across all trials but three different GR (low, medium and
   high) were indirectly obtained for each trial by altering the
   electromagnetic brake of the ergometer. The low, medium and high GR
   (mean +/- SD) resulted in CIL of 44 +/- 3.7, 84 +/- 6.5 and 152 +/- 17.9
   kg(.)m(2), respectively. Muscular activity levels of the gluteus maximus
   (GM), the vastus medialis (VM), the vastus lateralis (VL), the rectus
   femoris (RF), the medial hamstrings (MHAM), the gastrocnemius (GAS) and
   the soleus (SOL) muscles were quantified and analysed by mean root mean
   square (RMSmean). The muscular activity levels of the measured lower
   limb muscles were not significantly affected when the CIL was increased
   approximately four fold. This suggests that muscular activity levels
   measured on different cycling ergometers (with different GR and flywheel
   inertia) can be compared among each other, as they are not influenced by
   CIL.}},

Abstract = {{The benefit of impact-loading activity for bone strength depends on
   whether the additional bone mineral content (BMC) accrued at loaded
   sites is due to an increased bone size, volumetric bone mineral density
   (vBMD) or both. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dual energy
   X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), the airn of this study was to characterize
   the geometric changes of the dominant radius in response to long-term
   tennis playing and to assess the influence of muscle forces on bone
   tissue by investigating the muscle-bone relationship. Twenty tennis
   players (10 men and 10 women, mean age: 23.1 +/- 4.7 years, with 14.3
   +/- 3.4 years of playing) were recruited. The total bone volume,
   cortical volume, sub-cortical volume and muscle volume were measured at
   both distal radii by MRI. BMC was assessed by DXA and was divided by the
   total bone volume to derive vBMD. Grip strength was evaluated with a
   dynamometer. Significant side-to-side differences (P < 0.0001) were
   found in muscle volume (+9.7\%), grip strength (+ 13.3\%), BMC
   (+13.5\%), total bone volume (+10.3\%) and sub-cortical volume
   (+20.6\%), but not in cortical volume (+2.6\%, ns). The asymmetry in
   total bone volume explained 75\% of the variance in BMC asymmetry (P <
   0.0001). vBMD was slightly higher on the dominant side (+3.3\%, P <
   0.05). Grip strength and muscle volume correlated with all bone
   variables (except vBMD) on both sides (r = 0.48-0.86, P < 0.05-0.0001)
   but the asymmetries in muscle parameters did not correlate with those in
   bone parameters. After adjustment for Muscle volume or grip strength,
   BMC was still greater oil the dominant side. This study showed that the
   greater BMC induced by long-term tennis playing at the dominant radius
   was associated to a marked increase in bone size and a slight
   improvement in volumetric BMD, thereby improving bone strength. In
   addition to the muscle contractions, other mechanical stimuli seemed to
   exert a direct effect on bone tissue, contributing to the specific bone
   response to tennis playing. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Lanosterol synthase (LS) was isolated from microsomes from the plant
   pathogenic fungus Leptosphaeria nodorum (L. nodorum) and characterized
   with respect to its physical and kinetic properties. A medium throughput
   radiometric assay was developed for LS in order to screen potential
   inhibitors and to determine its kinetic properties. Quantification of LS
   activity relies on the separation of (+/-)2,3-oxidosqualene from
   lanosterol by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography
   (RP-HPLC) followed by analysis in a flow scintillation counter. LS from
   L. nodorum has an apparent K-m (oxidosqualene) of 43 mu M and an
   apparent native molecular weight of 150 kDa as determined by size
   exclusion chromatography. L. nodorum LS was compared to LS from Fusarium
   culmorum (F culmorum), Fusarium graminearum (F graminearum), and
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) for kinetic properties and
   inhibitory activity of a known LS inhibitor
   (4-bromophenyl){[}2-fluoro-4-{[}{[}6-(methyl-2-propenylamino)hexyl]oxy]p
   henyly]-methanone (compound 1) and a derivative of this inhibitor
   (compound 2). While the K-m (oxidosqualene) was similar for LS from all
   four organisms, there were differences in the activity of the two
   inhibitors against LS from these species. The characteristics of the
   assay and its use for screening molecules to find fungal inhibitors are
   described. To compare the biological activity of the inhibitors with
   their activity against LS, they were tested to determine the extent to
   which they suppressed the growth of L. nodorum and F. culmorum. The
   results suggest that the fungicidal activity of these inhibitors is
   related to their inhibitory effect on LS. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Before a telemedical application can be implemented in practice, various
   technical, organisational, and legal questions have to be solved. The
   answers to these questions are, however, in most cases not very obvious.
   Telemedicine guidelines, which could provide a path to follow, currently
   only exist for selected medical fields and are frequently customized for
   particular medical and technical scenarios. The use of existing
   telemedicine guidelines in Austrian health care is further complicated
   by the fact that most of them are based on foreign legal systems. This
   paper therefore aims to develop general telemedicine guidelines, which
   are appropriate for all application areas of telemedicine in Austrian
   health care. From nine existing telemedicine guidelines for individual
   medical fields, two generally applicable guidelines were derived. The
   corresponding abstraction process was based on a categorization of
   telemedical applications, which is oriented on the communication
   partners involved. The derived, general guidelines address seven typical
   problem domains in the practical application of a telemedical
   application. As opposed to the existing guidelines, they (1) are
   independent of special medical fields and are therefore appropriate for
   all application areas of telemedicine - also in medical fields, where no
   specific guidelines have existed before; (2) are adapted to the Austrian
   legal system; (3) provide additional insight for medical fields, where
   specific guidelines have already existed, as they can benefit from
   recommendations of other medical fields, where equivalent telemedical
   applications are employed.}},

Volume = {{71}},

Abstract = {{Darker beef from pasture-fed compared with grain-fed cattle may result
   from differences in physical activity rather than differences in
   nutrition. The objective was to determine if steers that were exercised
   produced darker meat than non-exercised steers and whether any effect
   was muscle-related. Exercised steers were walked 4.41 km daily in a
   single bout, six days per week for 18 weeks at an average speed of 5.2
   km h(-1). All steers were fed grass silage on an ad libitum basis plus 6
   kg concentrates. Following slaughter, muscle colour coordinates (W
   (lightness), `a' (redness) and `b' (yellowness) values) of M.
   longissimus dorsi (LD), M. semimembranosus (SM) and M. extensor carpi
   radialis (ECR) were recorded at 48 h postmortem and redness and
   yellowness were used to calculate muscle hue ('H') and colour
   intensity/saturation ('C). The pH of all muscles was measured at 1.5, 3,
   6, 22 and 48 It postmortem and LD samples were recovered (90 min
   postmortem) for glycolytic potential (GP) assessment. Exercise did not
   affect muscle lightness, yellowness, hue or colour intensity. However,
   LD was the darkest (P < 0.001) and SM the most saturated (P < 0.001)
   muscle. Exercise affected muscle redness in a muscle-dependent manner
   (muscle x exercise, P = 0.038) whereby ECR became more red with exercise
   but LD and SM were unaffected. There were muscle x time (P < 0.001) and
   time x exercise (P = 0.045) interactions for muscle pH. The ECR muscle
   had the highest pH at all times. The exercised steers had higher (P <
   0.05) LD muscle pH than control steers at 3 and 6 h postmortem. Exercise
   did not affect myoglobin concentration, which was muscle dependent,
   decreasing in the order: SM (6.72 mg/g) > ECR (6.33 mg/g) > LD (5.48
   mg/g), which were all different (P < 0.001). Exercise had no effect on
   GP in LD muscle (111 vs. 99 mu mol/g for control and exercised steers,
   respectively; SED = 6.6 mu mol/g). It was concluded that although
   application of exercise did not affect muscle lightness and thus, did
   not cause `darker' meat, it did affect muscle redness in a
   muscle-dependent manner. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Signal oversampling is frequently used to prevent distortion in
   time-series representations. When sampling at rates just above the
   Nyquist critical frequency (f(c)), Shannon's reconstruction theorem
   provides an alternative means of circumventing this problem. The purpose
   of this study was to determine whether surface electromyographic (EMG)
   data is compromised when sampled just above f(c) and whether Shannon's
   reconstruction theorem can correct these deficiencies. if present, Brief
   isometric elbow flexion contractions were performed at 100\%, 80\%,
   50\%, 25\%, 10\%, 5\% and 2.5\% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC)
   followed by one trial of random cyclic isometric contractions and
   relaxations. The 2 kHz signal was resampled at 1 kHz and the 2 and 1 kHz
   signals were reconstructed (2RS and 1RS, respectively) to a sampling
   rate or 20 kHz. Data were full-wave rectified (FWR) and low-pass
   filtered (LE), Peak amplitudes of the FWR and LE signals, average EMG
   (AEMG) amplitudes of the FWR and LE signals, mean power frequency of the
   raw data, number of gaps, and mean gap time of the LE signals were
   calculated, Significant differences were present in peak EMG and AEMG
   measurements between the 1 and 2 kHz, 2RS and 20 kHz signals and
   occasionally between the 1RS and the 2 kHz, 2RS and 20 kHz signals.
   These differences, although statistically significant were quite small
   amounting to less than 0.5\% MVC. No significant differences were found
   for the gaps parameters. The small differences seen. coupled with the
   processing time required for signal reconstruction, make oversampling as
   well as signal reconstruction in surface EMG measurements unnecessary.

Abstract = {{We explore the conditions under which firms are likely to pursue equity
   investment in new ventures as a way to source innovative ideas. We find
   that firms invest more in new ventures-commonly referred to as
   `corporate venture capital'-in industries with weak intellectual
   property protection and, to some extent, in industries with high
   technological ferment and where complementary distribution capability is
   important. Furthermore, we find that the greater a firm's cash flow and
   absorptive capacity, the more likely it is to invest. Our results
   suggest that in Schumpeterian environments incumbents may supplement
   their innovative efforts by tapping into the knowledge generated by new
   ventures. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Unusual among birds, the bill tips in crossbills (Loxia spp.) overlap in
   the vertical plane, with the tip of the lower mandible to either the
   left or right of the tip of the upper mandible when viewed from above.
   Patterns observed in wild populations and experimental foraging data
   suggest that a 1:1 ratio of left- to right-crossing individuals is
   maintained by frequency-dependent natural selection in some populations,
   and that genetic drift causes deviation from a 1:1 ratio in other
   populations. Both processes require a genetic basis for this remarkable
   polymorphism, yet few data are available that address whether, and how,
   mandible crossing direction is heritable. To test for a genetic basis of
   this trait (single or quantitative, autosomal or sex-linked), we
   analyzed resemblance in mandible crossing direction between related
   captive-bred individuals of several crossbill taxa with standard
   statistical techniques as well as modern animal model methodology.
   Surprisingly, we did not find statistically significant support for a
   genetic basis of mandible crossing direction. Comparisons of the ratio
   of left- to right-crossing males and females in wild populations also
   did not support a sex-linked quantitative genetic basis. We conclude
   that mandible crossing direction may have uncharacteristically low
   heritability, but we cannot rule out that it is nongenetically
   determined.}},

Abstract = {{Piroxicam was labeled effectively with Tc-99m due to the presence of
   electron donating atoms such as sulfur, nitrogen, and oxygen in its
   structure. The labeling yield was found to be influenced by different
   factors such as the amount of piroxicam, stannous chloride dihydrate, pH
   of the reaction mixture, reaction time and reaction temperature. The
   suitable amount of stannous chloride dihydrate required to produce high
   labeling yield of Tc-99m-piroxicam was 50 mu g, above this quantity (200
   mu g) a colloidal solution was formed. Another factor which plays a
   significant role in this labeling reaction is the pH of the reaction
   medium. The labeling reaction was done only at alkaline pH range from
   9-11, because piroxicam was not soluble at acidic or neutral pH. The
   labeling reaction proceeded well at room temperature and the complex was
   decomposed by heat. The labeled piroxicam (Tc-99m-piroxicam) showed good
   localization in inflamed foci and good imaging must be taken at 24-hour
   post injection, as the ratio of both types of inflammation (sterile and
   septic) to the background are 10.6 and 8.7, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses low power medium access control ( MAC) protocols
   for the downlink channel of infrastructure wireless sensor networks.
   Access points are assumed to be energy unconstrained. The trade-off
   between the power consumption of the sensor nodes and the transmission
   delay is analyzed, focusing on low traffic. We describe WiseMAC (
   Wireless Sensor MAC), a new protocol for the downlink of infrastructure
   wireless sensor networks. Another original contribution is the
   presentation and analysis of PTIP ( Periodic Terminal Initiated
   Polling). Here, polling is used in the reversed direction as compared to
   common polling protocols. WiseMAC and PTIP are compared with PSM ( Power
   Save Mode), the power save protocol used in both the IEEE 802.11 and
   IEEE 802.15.4 ZigBee standards. Analytical expressions are derived for
   the power consumption and the transmission delay for each protocol, as a
   function of the wake- up period. It is shown that WiseMAC provides, with
   lowbit rate radio transceivers, a significantly lower power consumption
   than PSM. Although less energy efficient than WiseMAC and PSM, it is
   shown that PTIP can, thanks to its implementation simplicity, become
   attractive for applications tolerating large transmission delays.}},

Abstract = {{Dried ground leaves of Combretum woodii were extracted with 10 different
   solvents (hexane, diisopropyl ether, diethyl ether, methylene
   dichloride, ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran, acetone, ethanol, methanol
   and water) to determine the best extractant for subsequent isolation and
   characterization of antibacterial compounds. With the exception of the
   water extract, which had no antibacterial activity, the other extracts
   were bioactive with at least one of them exhibiting minimum inhibitory
   concentration values of 0.04 mg/ml against Staphylococcus aureus,
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli or Enterococcus faecalis.
   Intermediate polarity solvents extracted c. 10\% of the dry mass
   compared to c. 3\% with the more polar or non-polar solvents. These
   solvents also had higher antibacterial activity than more polar or
   non-polar extractants. Ethyl acetate was the best extractant with an
   average minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 0.08 mg/ml for
   the four pathogens followed by acetone and methylene dichloride with
   values of 0.14 mg/ml. The average MIC values for the positive controls
   were 0.13 (ampicillin) and 0.12 mg/ml (chloramphenicol). By taking the
   quantity extracted from the leaf powder into consideration, the total
   activity, a measure of potency, was highest for methylene dichloride
   (1309 ml/g) followed by acetone (1279 ml/g) extracts. The antibacterial
   activity was high enough to consider the use of extracts for clinical
   application and to isolate and characterise antibacterial compounds from
   the extracts. Based on the R-f values of the antibacterial compounds
   determined by bioautography, the antibacterial compound was not a
   polyphenol or a tannin.}},

Abstract = {{Vertebrate kinetochores contain over 50 different proteins organized
   into three distinct regions: the inner plate, outer plate, and fibrous
   corona. The present study characterizes numerous precursors of
   kinetochore assembly in a system free of centromeric chromatin, Xenopus
   extracts. Hydrodynamic analysis suggests there are a minimum of two
   monomeric proteins and six preassembled complexes that accumulate on
   centromeres to form the kinetochore. The inner and outer kinetochore
   assemble from at least two distinct kinetochore complexes containing the
   proteins Mis12, Zwint, and Ndc80, all of which interact by
   immunoprecipitation. There is also a network of interactions between the
   fibrous corona proteins that is dissociated by microtubules. We quantify
   the number of molecules of specific proteins assembled into a single
   kinetochore. There are between 800 and 1200 molecules of the measured
   inner and outer kinetochore proteins, demonstrating that the components
   in these regions are in similar stoichiometry. In contrast, the measured
   fibrous corona proteins are present at 250-300 molecules per
   kinetochore. Zwint, but not Mis12, requires the Ndc80 complex for
   assembly into the kinetochore. Further, Ndc80 requires Zwint for
   assembly, indicating a codependency for these two proteins. Our data
   provide a model for the structural architecture and assembly pathway of
   the vertebrate kinetochore.}},

Abstract = {{Cardiac injury, occurred after traumatic brain injury (TBI), has been
   recognized for more than a century. Bcl-2 is a key regulatory component
   of the mitochondrial cell death pathway, and its overexpression is
   cytoprotective in many cell types. The therapeutic agents, which induce
   the expression of bcl-2 protein, might provide a new therapy to prevent
   cardiac myocyte damage following TBI. In this study, we investigated
   whether methylprednisolone I sodium succinate (MPSS) influences the
   expression of bcl-2 in the heart. Wistar-Albino female rats underwent
   TBI (300 g/cm) generated by the weight-drop method, and were left
   untreated (n = 6) or treated with either MPSS (30 mg/kg) (n = 6) or
   vehicle (albumin solution) (n = 6). The heart was isolated from each
   animal with TBI. For comparison, the hearts were isolated from
   sham-operated (n = 6) and control rats (n = 6). The relative expression
   of bcl-2 mRNA in the heart was quantitated by real-time polymerase chain
   reaction. We also assessed lipid peroxidation in the heart tissue by
   determining the concentration of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances
   (TBARs) as an indicator of tissue damage. The bcl-2 expression level was
   significantly higher in the hearts of MPSS-treated rats compared to that
   of other TBI groups (p < 0.0001). Moreover, TBI increased the lipid
   peroxidation in the heart, which was significantly reduced by the
   treatment with MPSS (p < 0.0001). These findings provide evidence for
   the efficacy of MPSS in protection of cardiac myocytes to achieve
   optimal heart donation after TBI in heart transplantation. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Some of the most damaging weeds of natural ecosystems in temperate
   Australia and similar Mediterranean environments are legumes. A study
   was undertaken to determine the level of naturalisation and impact of
   exotic legumes in temperate Australia. This was the first step in
   attempting to develop a method of evaluating the weed risk of future
   legume species introductions. A study of nursery catalogues indicated
   that legumes were widely cultivated throughout temperate Australia in
   the early part of the 20th century. A number of these species were able
   to escape from cultivation and have become part of the region's
   naturalised flora. Non-climbing herbaceous legume species were the most
   common type of legume recorded as naturalised. A smaller number of
   naturalised species were reported as being present in natural
   ecosystems. A higher introduction pressure increased the chance of
   legume species being able to naturalise and also establish in natural
   ecosystems. The results of a questionnaire showed that of the legume
   species that established in natural ecosystems there were differences in
   regard to their perceived level of impact. Woody perennial legumes had
   the highest reported impacts and non-climbing herbaceous species the
   lowest. The higher impact species also had a history of use as garden
   ornamentals, while lower impact species were largely agricultural. The
   results of this survey suggest that until greater accuracy is achieved
   with regard to the prediction of weeds and their impact, a precautionary
   approach should be taken to the importation, sale and cultivation of
   woody legume species. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aims of this study were: (1) to define and classify those
   connective structures of the female pelvis that are of potential
   clinical interest, (2) to evaluate the adequacy of the Terminologia
   Anatomica (official nomenclature) and (3) to establish a correspondence
   between the official nomenclature and the most commonly used terms.
   Study design: The results of 30 macroscopic and laparoscopic dissections
   of fresh cadavers with and without vessel injection of colored latex
   solutions were compared with the descriptions and definitions in the
   Terminologia Anatomica and the most frequently cited English and
   non-English literature from 1890 to 2003.
   Results: We identified 3 groups of fasciae, parietal pelvic fascia,
   visceral pelvic fascia, and extraserosal pelvic fascia, which could be
   divided into diverse clinically relevant anatomical structures
   characterized by different locations, spatial orientation, and
   consistency. These structures differed considerably with regard to
   number and nomenclature from those described in the Terminologia
   Anatomica and part of the literature.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that the official terminology applied to
   the connective structures of the female pelvis could be profitably
   revised and expanded. We offer a complete description of these
   structures and suggest a classification that may be useful for teaching
   and clinical purposes. (C) 2005 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the influences of the changes in fin geometry on heat
   transfer and pressure drop of a plate fin and tube heat exchanger are

   is used in the modeling, due to symmetrical condition. The results of
   heat transfer, static, and total pressure drop values of ten different
   fins are tabulated and the normalized values of them are, also, given
   for the comparison of the models. The distance between fins is found to
   have a considerable effect on pressure drop. It is observed that placing
   the fin tube at downstream region affects heat transfer positively.
   Another important result of the study is that increasing ellipticity of
   the fin tube increases the heat transfer while it, also, results in an
   important reduction in pressure drop. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{EPILEPSIA}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{46}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Conventional and novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   techniques can detect cerebral abnormalities in patients with refractory
   focal epilepsies. Correlation of preoperative MRI and histopathology is
   important to validate MRI findings, but in practice is far from
   straightforward. Peroperative neuronavigation and placement of markers
   on tissue is of limited use in temporal lobe resections. MRI scanning of
   the resected specimen for registration with in vivo MRI is complicated
   by anisotropic tissue deformation. We have developed a method to
   facilitate registration of preoperative MRI with the resected specimen
   and to enable correlation of MRI findings with histopathology.
   Methods: Sixteen en bloc temporal lobe resections undertaken for
   refractory temporal lobe epilepsy were studied. The specimens were fixed
   in formalin and then cut coronally by using a cradle with parallel
   blades at 5-mm intervals to ensure evenly thick tissue slices in the
   same orientation. Volumetric T-1-weighted preoperative MRIs were
   reformatted, and consecutive slices (0.94 mm) cut in the same
   orientation as the resected lobe were visually compared with photographs
   of tissue slices by two independent observers.
   Results: In 15 (94\%) of 16 cases, a < 2-mm difference was found between
   the two observers' matches of MRI slices with tissue slices. In the last
   case, a 4-mm difference was noted. In all cases, a consensus was reached
   by the two observers. The suggested MRI-histology matches were within
   the resections seen on postoperative scans.
   Conclusions: Careful labelling and postoperative handling and slicing
   ensured histopathologic tissue slices of uniform thickness and slicing
   angle. This technique can be applied to a range of MRI datasets,
   enabling exploration of the pathologic basis of abnormalities on
   conventional and novel MRI acquisitions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper concerns the determination of the band structure of physical
   systems with reduced dimensionality with the method of the linear
   combination of bulk band (LCBB), according to the full-band energy
   dispersion of the underlying crystal. The derivation of the eigenvalue
   equation is reconsidered in detail for quasi-two-dimensional (2D) and
   quasi-one-dimensional (1D) systems and we demonstrate how the choice of
   the volume expansion in the three-dimensional reciprocal lattice space
   is important in order to obtain a separated eigenvalue problem for each
   wave vector in the unconstrained plane (for 2D systems) or in the
   unconstrained direction (for 1D systems). The clarification of the
   expansion volume naturally leads to identification of the 2D and 1D
   first Brillouin zone (BZ) for any quantization direction. We then apply
   the LCBB approach to the silicon and germanium inversion layers and
   illustrate the main features of the energy dispersion and the 2D first
   BZ for the {[}001], {[}110], and {[}111] quantization directions. We
   further compare the LCBB energy dispersion with the one obtained with
   the conventional effective mass approximation (EMA) in the case of (001)
   silicon inversion layers. As an interesting result, we show that the
   LCBB method reveals a valley at the edge of the 2D first BZ which is not
   considered by the EMA model and that gives a significant contribution to
   the 2D density of states.}},

Abstract = {{Loss of allele-specific expression by the imprinted genes IGF2 and H19
   has been correlated with a differentially methylated region (DMR)
   upstream to the H19 gene. The H19-DMR contains seven potential
   CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) binding sites. CTCF is a chromatin insulator
   and a multifunctional transcription factor whose binding to the H19-DMR
   is suppressed by DNA methylation. Our study included a group of 41 head
   and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) samples. The imprinting status
   of the H19 gene was analyzed in 11 out of 35 positive cases for H19 gene
   expression, and only 1 of them showed loss of imprinting. We detected a
   significant correlation (P=0.041, Fisher's exact test) between H19
   expression and tumor recurrence. Among H19 positive cases, six were T2,
   in which five developed recurrence and/or metastasis. Inversely, in the
   group of tumors that showed no H19 gene expression, 5 out of 24 were T2
   and only I presented regional recurrence. These data support the
   hypothesis that H19 expression could be used as a prognostic marker to
   indicate recurrence in early stage tumors. We also examined the
   methylation of the CTCF binding site 1 in a subgroup of these samples.
   The H19 gene silencing and loss of imprinting were not correlated with
   the methylation pattern of the CTCF binding site 1. However, the
   significant correlation between H19 expression and tumor recurrence
   suggest that this transcript could be a marker for the progression of
   HNSCC. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{During the design or refurbishment of a thrust bearing a question that
   occurs frequently is, ``How safe is this bearing?{''} Factors of safety
   are widely used in engineering design, and some applications require
   compliance with safety factors that are specifically stated in codes of
   practice. Most manufacturers have limits on the maximum allowable
   bearing temperature. These can be useful as a guide but offer no graded
   answer as to how much safer (or less safe) a bearing is made by applying
   a particular design decision. A numerical factor of safety would give a
   quantitative measure of the safety of a bearing and would be useful in
   judging whether a proposed design change is worthwhile in terms of
   improved safety. Experience has shown that failure of a babbitt bearing
   often develops from a local yielding (and subsequent flow) at a discrete
   point on the surface. This develops into rippling and folding of the
   material and escalates rapidly to a bearing ``wipe{''}. This article
   describes the application of the Tresca and von Mises criteria of
   yielding to give a numerical factor of safety against plastic flow of
   the babbitt. the method uses data for the yield point of the babbitt as
   a function of temperature and assumes that the material on the bearing
   surface is constrained in both lateral coordinate directions. In
   practice, any data on the failure of hydrothurst bearings are invariably
   regarded as proprietary by manufacturers and there is apparently no
   published work available that can be used to correlate the model.
   However, the method developed in this paper is quite general and
   applicable to any fully hydrodynamic bearing loaded to the yield point
   of the surfaces. Results for large babbitt-faced journal bearings that
   were deliberately taken to failure are used for a correlation.
   Reasonable agreement is shown between predicted and actual failure. The
   calculation of a factor of safety can be a useful tool for evaluating
   initial designs or modifications during refurbishment. Some factors
   concerning the assessment of an acceptable minimum film thickness are
   also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Let x = (x(1),..., x(n)) be a sequence of positive integers. An

   <= x(1) + (...) + x(i). In this paper we give a combinatorial approach
   to the enumeration of (a, b, ..., b)-parking functions by their leading
   terms, which covers the special cases x = (1,..., 1), (a, 1, 1), and
   (b,..., b). The approach relies on bijections between the x-parking
   functions and labeled rooted forests. To serve this purpose, we present
   a simple method for establishing the required bijections. Some bijective
   results between certain sets of x-parking functions of distinct leading
   terms are also given. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of
   self-mutilation (SM) in Turkish male substance-dependent patients, and
   to investigate the relationship of SM with childhood abuse and neglect,
   alexithymia and temperament and character dimensions of personality.
   Methods: Participants were 136 consecutively admitted males with
   substance dependence (96 alcohol and 40 drug). Substance dependence was
   diagnosed by means of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV
   (SCID-I), Turkish version. Patients were investigated with the childhood
   abuse and neglect questionnaire, Toronto alexithymia scale (TAS-20) and
   temperament and character inventory (TCI).
   Results: Among substance-dependent patients 34.6\% was considered as a
   group with SM. Rates of being single and unemployed, histories of
   physical and sexual abuse and suicide attempts were higher in the SM
   group. Current age, age at first substance use and age at regular
   substance use were lower in the group with SM. Mean of TAS-20 and
   `difficulty in identifying feelings' (DIF) and `difficulty in describing
   feelings' (DDF) subscales of TAS-20 were higher in SM group. There were
   no significant differences between groups in terms of TCI subscales.
   Age, childhood physical abuse and suicide attempt history predicted SM
   in logistic regression.
   Conclusions: Young substance users with childhood physical abuse
   histories could be the target population to prevent self-mutilating
   behavior. This study also suggests that whenever self-mutilating
   behavior is present, the possibility of childhood abuse, alexithymia and
   suicide attempts must be evaluated. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{72}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{We analyze topological solitons in the noncommutative plane by taking a
   concrete instance of the quantum Hall system with the SU(N) symmetry,
   where a soliton is identified with a Skyrmion. It is shown that a
   topological soliton induces an excitation of the electron number density
   from the ground-state value around it. When a judicious choice of the
   topological charge density J(0)(x) is made, it acquires a physical
   reality as the electron density excitation Delta rho(cl)(x) around a
   topological soliton, Delta rho(cl)(x)=-J(0)(x). Hence a noncommutative
   soliton carries necessarily the electric charge proportional to its
   topological charge. A field-theoretical state is constructed for a
   soliton state irrespectively of the Hamiltonian. In general, it involves
   an infinitely many parameters. They are fixed by minimizing its energy
   once the Hamiltonian is chosen. We study explicitly the cases where the
   system is governed by the hard-core interaction and by the
   noncommutative CPN-1 model, where all these parameters are determined
   analytically and the soliton excitation energy is obtained.}},

Journal = {{BRAIN AND COGNITION}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{59}},

Pages = {{60-70}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Several studies have identified that adjuvant chemotherapy
   for breast cancer is associated with cognitive impairment; however, the
   magnitude of this impairment is unclear. This study assessed the
   severity and nature of cognitive impairment associated with adjuvant
   chemotherapy by conducting a meta-analysis of the published literature
   to date.
   Method: Six studies (five cross-sectional and one prospective) meeting
   the inclusion criteria provided a total of 208 breast cancer patients
   who had undergone adjuvant chemotherapy, 122 control participants and
   122 effect sizes (Cohen's d) falling into six cognitive domains. First,
   the mean of all the effect sizes within each cognitive domain was
   calculated (separately for cross-sectional and prospective studies);
   second, a mean effect size was calculated for all of the effect sizes in
   each cross-sectional study; and third, regression analyses were
   conducted to determine any relationships between effect size for each
   study and four different variables.
   Results: For the cross-sectional studies, each of the cognitive domains
   assessed (besides attention) showed small to moderate effect sizes
   (-0.18 to -0.51). The effect sizes for each study were small to moderate
   (-0.07 to -0.50) and regression analysis detected 2 a significant
   negative logarithmic relationship (R-2 =.63) between study effect size
   and the time since last receiving chemotherapy. For the prospective
   study, effect sizes ranged from small to large (0.11-1.09) and indicated
   improvements in cognitive function from the beginning of chemotherapy
   treatment to 3 weeks and even 1 year following treatment.
   Conclusion: This meta-analysis suggests that cognitive impairment occurs
   reliably in women who have undergone adjuvant chemotherapy for breast
   cancer but that the magnitude of this impairment depends on the type of
   design that was used (i.e., cross-sectional or prospective). Thus, more
   prospective studies are required before definite conclusions about the
   effects of adjuvant chemotherapy on cognition can be made. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Objectives The objectives of the present study were to examine
   sociodemographic correlates of soy food consumption among women at
   increased risk of breast cancer, describe factors influencing soy food
   consumption or nonconsumption, and identify women's sources of
   information about soy foods.
   Design A cross-sectional, self-report survey was used to assess
   frequency of and factors influencing soy food consumption. Soy food
   intake was reported for the past year.
   Subjects/setting Participants were 452 women, with family histories of
   breast cancer who were enrolled in a cancer risk assessment program.
   Statistical analyses performed Comparisons between consumers and
   nonconsumers of soy foods were performed using multivariate logistic
   regression and chi(2) analyses.
   Results Thirty-two percent reported soy food consumption. Commonly
   consumed soy foods were vegetable burgers, tofu, and soymilk. Consumers
   of soy foods were more likely to have higher levels of education and
   report eating five or more daily servings of fruits and vegetables. The
   primary reason for consumption of soy foods was eating a healthful diet,
   whereas insufficient knowledge about soy food preparation was the
   primary reason stated for nonconsumption. Both consumers and
   nonconsumers reported obtaining information about soy foods from
   magazines, friends, and newspapers. Consumers also indicated using the
   Internet to seek information.
   Conclusions These findings contribute to our understanding of the level
   of soy intake among women at increased risk for breast cancer and
   highlight potential factors that may influence women's decisions
   regarding soy food consumption. Women, particularly in this vulnerable
   population, would benefit from clear messages regarding the health

Abstract = {{Here we describe preliminary research into the in sitar electrokinetic
   generation of continuous iron-rich precipitates to act as sub-surface
   barriers for the containment of contaminated sites. This is achieved
   using sacrificial iron electrodes emplaced either side of a
   soil/sediment mass to introduce iron into the system, and their
   dissolution and re-precipitation under the influence of an applied (DC)
   electric field. Continuous vertical and horizontal iron-rich bands (up
   to 2 em thick) have been generated over a timescale of 300-500 h, at
   voltages of <5 V with an electrode separation of between 15 and 30 cm.
   The thickness of the iron-rich band increases as the applied voltage is
   increased. Geotechnical tests in sand indicate that the iron-rich band
   produced is practically impervious (coefficient of permeability of
   10(-9) ms(-1) or less), and has significant mechanical strength
   (unconfined compressive strength of 10.8 N mm(-2)). By monitoring the
   current, the integrity of the iron-rich band may be assessed, and by
   continued application of current, the barrier may `self heal'. The
   iron-rich barrier is composed of amorphous iron, goethite,
   lepidocrocite, maghemite and native iron.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanism(s) underlying the antibacterial activity of probiotic
   Lactobacillus strains appears to be multifactorial and includes lowering
   of the pH and the production of lactic acid and of antibacterial
   compounds, including bacteriocins and nonbacteriocin, non-lactic acid
   molecules. Addition of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimum essential
   medium to the incubating medium delays the killing activity of lactic
   acid. We found that the probiotic strains Lactobacillus johnsonii La1,
   Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus casei Shirota YIT9029, L.
   casei DN-114001, and L. rhamnosus GR1 induced a dramatic decrease in the
   viability of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344 mainly
   attributable to non-lactic acid molecule (s) present in the cell-free
   culture supernatant (CFCS). These molecules were more active against
   serovar Typhimurium SL1344 in the exponential growth phase than in the
   stationary growth phase. We also showed that the production of the
   non-lactic acid substance(s) responsible for the killing activity was
   dependent on growth temperature and that both unstable and stable
   substances with killing activity were present in the CFCSs. We found
   that the complete inhibition of serovar Typhimurium SL1344 growth
   results from a pH-lowering effect.}},

   mean age 7.2 +/- 1.3 years, the side effects of long-term glucocorticoid

   measurements (t(0)) of height (H) as standard deviation score (SDS),
   body mass index (BMI) as kg/m(2) and bone mineral density (BMD) at the

   X-ray absorption technique, expressed as Z score, with follow-up
   measurements at 1 (t(1)) and 2 (t(2)) years were assessed. Group I
   patients (10 pts) treated with oral prednisone (2 mg/kg/die-for one
   month for 2 cycles) showed significantly different HSDS, BMI, FBMD and
   LBMD at t(1) and t(2) (P < 0.005) than other groups treated respectively
   with pulsed high doses of dexamethasone (24 mg/m(2) over 4 days/months

   was shown in patients on beta-blockers, whereas alphal blockers seem to
   have favorable effects on glycemic profile. In this study, the metabolic
   effect of carvedilol in nondiabetic patients with chronic heart failure
   (CHF) was evaluated.
   Methods and Results: Twenty-eight nondiabetic CHF patients were
   enrolled. Before being started on carvedilol and on the highest
   tolerated dose, each patient underwent an oral glucose tolerance test
   and fasting insulin, glycohemoglobin, lipid concentrations were measured
   and insulin sensitivity indices (HOMA, ISI-gly, and ISI-composite) were
   calculated. An impaired glucose tolerance was found (2-hour glycemia 144
   +/- 42 mg/dL), with a fasting glycemia at upper limits of normal (108
   +/- 13 mg/dL) and no significant differences between basal and
   carvedilol treatment measurements. Fasting insulinemia significantly
   decreased during carvedilol treatment (13.6 +/- 7.3 versos 9.8 +/- 5.1
   mu U/mL; P = .022), with a reduction of the HOMA index (3.75 +/- 1.95
   versus 2.73 +/- 1.47; P = 034) and an increase of the ISI-gly index
   (0.85 +/- 0.22 versus 1.03 +/- 0.31; P = .025). The lipoprotein profile
   did not significantly change.
   Conclusion: Carvedilol might have some positive metabolic effects on
   increasing insulin sensitivity that would make it suitable for diabetic
   patients that have a worse prognosis than non diabetic patients with
   CHF.}},

Abstract = {{The Constant-Murley shoulder assessment score has proven to be a
   valuable diagnostic instrument. Thus, in the literature it has been
   mentioned that the clinical accuracy of this score varies especially
   when comparing patients in larger, inhomogeneous patient groups. The
   ``relative Constant score{''} (CSrel) tries to minimize these problems
   by using reference parameters out of healthy age and gender related
   control groups. The authors of this study tried to show that it is even
   more accurate to use the functional performance of the uninjured
   collateral. shoulder of the same individual as reference, introducing
   the ``individual relative Constant score{''} (CSindiv). The CSindiv and
   the CSrel were compared for 125 consecutive patients with shoulder
   disorders, and a group of 125 healthy volunteers as a control group.
   In a non-parametric comparison of the reciever operating characteristics
   the CSindiv shows the higher ability to discriminate between patients
   and healthy volunteers (p = 0.004). This indicates that the individual
   relative Constant score gives a more accurate view about the functional
   result for shoulder disorders. It is expected to be more reliable for
   larger and incoherent patient populations, because specific
   interindividual differences, regarding the patient's age, gender and
   constitution are eliminated as well as other individual physiological
   parameters. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction and objectives. Measurement of N-terminal pro-B-type
   natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) helps in diagnosing heart failure (HF).
   The test's usefulness may be greatest in patients with severe dyspnea of
   uncertain origin. However, NTproBNP has not been evaluated specifically
   in this setting.
   Patients and method. This prospective emergency department study
   included 70 patients with shortness of breath at rest as their chief
   complaint. In the attending physician's opinion, both HF and a
   non-cardiac cause were equally probable. Blinded NTproBNP measurement
   was carried out in blood samples collected on admission. Patients were
   monitored and their final diagnoses were based on clinical findings,
   therapeutic responses, and cardiac and noncardiac tests performed during
   hospitalization.
   Results. The NTproBNP level was higher in the 49 patients (70\%) with a
   final diagnosis of HF (P=.006); the area under the ROC curve was 0.72
   (0.60-0.82). The optimum diagnostic cut-off value was 900 pg/mL, which
   had an accuracy of 87\%, a sensitivity of 98\%, and a negative
   predictive value of 92\%. The NTproBNP level was significantly higher in
   the 6 patients (9\%) who died during hospitalization (P=.009); the area
   under the ROC curve was 0.87 (0.76-0.93) and the optimum cut-off value
   for predicting death was 5500 pg/mL, which had an accuracy of 77\%, a
   sensitivity of 100\%, and a positive likelihood ratio of 4.2.
   Conclusions. In patients with severe dyspnea and an uncertain diagnosis
   of HF, an NTproBNP level < 900 pg/mL helps exclude the presence of HF,
   whereas a NTproBNP level > 5500 pg/mL identifies patients at an
   increased risk of death.}},

Abstract = {{The neuraminidase gene, nanH, is present in the 01, non-toxigenic Vibrio
   cholerae Amazonia strain. Its location has been assigned to a 150 kb
   NotI DNA fragment, with the use of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and
   DNA hybridization. This NotI fragment is positioned inside 630 kb SfiI
   and 1900 kb I-CeuI fragments of chromosome 1. Association of the
   pathogenicity island VPI-2, carrying nanH and other genes, with
   toxigenic strains has been described by other authors. The presence of
   nanH in a non-toxigenic strain is an exception to this rule. The
   Amazonia strain nanH was sequenced (Genbank accession No. AY825932) and
   compared to available V. cholerae sequences. The sequence is different
   from those of pandemic strains, with 72 nucleotide substitutions. This
   is the first description of an O1 strain with a different nanH allele.
   The most variable domain of the Amazonia NanH is the second lectin wing,
   comprising 13 out of 17 amino acid substitutions. Based on the presence
   of nanH in the same region of the genome, and similarity of the adjacent
   sequences to VPI-2 sequences, it is proposed that the pathogenicity
   island VPI-2 is present in this strain.}},

Abstract = {{Autophagy, including macroautophagy (MA), chaperone-mediated autophagy
   (CMA), crinophagy, pexophagy and microautophogy, are processes by which
   cells select internal components such as proteins, secretary vesicles,
   organelles, or foreign bodies, and deliver them to lysosomes for
   degradation. MA and CMA are activated during conditions of serum
   withdrawal in cell culture and during short-term and prolonged
   starvation in organisms, respectively. Although MA and CMA are activated
   under similar conditions, they are regulated by different mechanisms. We
   used pulse/chase analysis under conditions in which most intracellular
   proteolysis is due to CMA to test a variety of compounds for effects on
   this process. We show that inhibitors of MA such as 3-methyladenine,
   wortmannin, and LY294002 have no effect on CMA. Protein degradation by
   MA is sensitive to microtubule inhibitors such as colcemide and
   vinblastine, but protein degradation by CMA is not. Activators of MA
   such as rapamycin also have no effect on CMA. We demonstrate that CMA,
   like MA, is inhibited by protein synthesis inhibitors anisomycin and
   cycloheximide. CMA is also partially inhibited when the p38 mitogen
   activated protein kinase is blocked. Finally we demonstrate that the
   glucose-6-phophate dehydrogenose inhibitor, 6-aminonicotinamide, and
   heat shock protein of 90 kilodaltons inhibitor, geldanamycin, have the
   ability to activate CMA.}},

Abstract = {{The task of visualization, as it applies to computing, includes by
   default the notion of pluralism and perspectivism since there is an
   explicit attempt at representing one, often textual, interface in terms
   of a more graphical one. This desire for alternate, subjective
   perspectives is consistent with art theory and practice, and even though
   rigor and formalism generally mean different things to artists and
   computer scientists, there is room for collaboration and connection by
   applying artistic aesthetics to computing, while maintaining that which
   makes computing a viable, usable field. This new area is called
   aesthetic computing. Within this area, there is an attempt to balance
   qualitative with quantitative representational aspects of visual
   computing, recognizing that aesthetics creates a dimension that is
   consistent with supporting numerous visual perspectives. We introduce
   one aspect of aesthetic computing, with specific examples from our
   research and teaching to illustrate the potential and possibilities
   associated with alternate representations of discrete structures such as
   finite state automata and a data flow network. We limit ourselves, and
   our methodology, to model notations with components that bear a largely
   symbolic connection to what they represent, thus providing greater
   degrees of representational freedom. We show that by exploring
   aesthetics, we surface some important philosophical and cultural
   questions regarding notation, which turn out to be at least as important
   as the algorithmic and procedural means of achieving customized model
   component representations. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Suicide rates of young people are increasing in many geographic areas.
   There is a need to recognize more precisely the role of specific mental
   disorders and their comparative importance for understanding suicide and
   its prevention. The authors reviewed the published English-language
   research, where psychiatric diagnoses that met diagnostic criteria were
   reported, to reexamine the presence and distribution of mental disorders
   in cases of completed suicide among young people worldwide. The number
   and geographical distribution of cases were limited (N = 894 cases). The
   majority of cases (88.6\%) had a diagnosis of at least I mental
   disorder. Mood disorders were most frequent (42.1\%), followed by
   substance-related disorders (40.8\%) and disruptive behavior disorders
   (20.8\%). Those strategies focusing exclusively on the prevention and
   treatment of depression in young people need to be reconsidered. A
   comprehensive suicide prevention strategy among young people should
   target mental disorders as a whole, not depression alone, and consider
   contextual factors.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents an objective air quality classification scheme for
   observed ozone (O-3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and
   particulate matter (PM10) time series in Germany. The classification is
   based on the medians of daily average concentration and relative daily
   variation. Six (O-3 and NO2) and five (SO2 and PM10) different regimes
   were identified by means of hierarchical clustering. The stability of
   the clusters in relation to variable scaling and transformation was
   ensured by a cross-validation test based on re-sampling. Quick
   classification rules were developed, which permit a rapid and easy
   classification of any further observed or modelled annual time series.
   The climatological properties of the defined regimes were examined in
   terms of the mean and maximum values, as well as inter-annual, yearly,
   weekly and daily variability. The polluted regimes are characterised by
   a pronounced weekly cycle. O-3 and NO2 classifications agree reasonably
   well for most stations, but the range Of SO2 and PM10 concentrations is
   large within specific O-3 regimes. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

   drugs to treat psychiatric disorders. At the sixth Measurement and
   Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia conference,
   ``New Approaches to Assessing and Improving Cognition in
   Schizophrenia,{''} a discussion group was formed to address issues
   related to the development of predictive animal models of cognition that
   may be used as preclinical assays for putative cognitive enhancers. We
   identified 2 complementary approaches used to model cognitive
   impairments in animals. First, basic lesion/pharmacological models
   provide information about the particular neural substrates that may
   underlie different types of cognitive deficits found in schizophrenia.
   Findings from these studies can be mapped onto the second, more
   elaborate and etiologically relevant neurodevelopmental models of the
   disorder to ascertain which cognitive systems may be altered by early
   developmental insults. Particular attention must be given to the types
   of animal tasks used, in order to relate directly to the cognitive
   domains that are affected in schizophrenia patients. Importantly, the
   validation and standardization of the methodologies used in these
   preclinical assays would require the establishment of a preclinical
   trials network, serving as a counterpart to the recently established
   Treatment Units for Research on Neurocognition and Schizophrenia. The
   need to validate specific approaches to assess cognitive functions
   relevant to schizophrenia could be satisfied by a concerted effort
   enabled by a new funding directive from the National Institute of Mental
   Health with the explicit purpose of facilitating research on these
   models and assessing novel drug therapies that may be used to ameliorate

Abstract = {{Study objectives: Currently, esophageal pressure monitoring is the
   ``gold standard{''} measure for inspiratory efforts, hut its invasive
   nature necessitates a better tolerated and noninvasive method to be used
   on children. Pulse transit time (PTT) has demonstrated its potential as
   a noninvasive surrogate marker for inspiratory efforts. The principle
   velocity determinant of PTT is the change in stiffness of the arterial
   wall and is inversely correlated to BP. Moreover, PTT has been shown to
   identify changes in inspiratory effort via the BP fluctuations induced
   by negative pleural pressure swings. In this study, the capability of
   PTT to classify respiratory, events during sleep as either central or
   obstructive in nature was investigated.
   Setting and participants: PTT measure was used in adjunct to routine
   overnight polysomnographic studies performed on 33 children (26 boys and
   7 girls; mean +/- SD age, 6.7 +/- 3.9 years). The accuracy of PTT
   measurements was then evaluated against scored corresponding respiratory
   events in the polysomnography recordings.
   Results: Three hundred thirty-four valid respiratory events occurred and
   were analyzed. One hundred twelve obstructive events (OEs) showed a
   decrease in mean PTT over a 10-sample window that had a probability of
   being correctly ranked below the baseline PTT during tidal breathing of
   0.92 (p < 0.005); 222 central events (CEs) showed a decrease in the
   variance of PTT over a 10-sample window that had a probability of being
   ranked below the baseline PTT of 0.94 (p < 0.005). This indicates that,
   at a sensitivity of 0.90, OEs can be detected with a specificity of 0.82
   and CEs can be detected with a specificity of 0.80.
   Conclusions: PTT is able to categorize CEs and OEs accordingly in the
   absence of motion artifacts, including hypopneas. Hence, PTT shows
   promise to differentiate respiratory, events accordingly and can be an
   important diagnostic tool in pediatric respiratory sleep studies.}},

Abstract = {{Similar to other anticancer agents, intrinsic or acquired resistance to
   DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics is a major obstacle for cancer therapy.
   Current strategies aimed at overcoming this problem are mostly based on
   the premise that tumor cells acquire heritable genetic mutations that
   contribute to drug resistance. Here, we present evidence for an
   epigenetic, tumor cell adhesion-mediated, and reversible form of drug
   resistance that is associated with a reduction of DNA mismatch repair
   proteins PMS2 and/or MLH1 as well as other members of this DNA repair
   process. Growth of human breast cancer, human melanoma, and murine EMT-6
   breast cancer cell lines as multicellular spheroids in vitro, which is
   associated with increased resistance to many chemotherapeutic drugs,
   including alkylating agents, is shown to lead to a reproducible
   down-regulation of PMS2, MLH1, or, in some cases, both as well as MHS6,
   MSH3, and MSH2. The observed downregulation is in part reversible by
   treatment of tumor spheroids with the DNA-demethylating agent,
   5-azacytidine. Thus, treatment of EMT-6 mouse mammary carcinoma
   spheroids with 5-azacytidine resulted in reduced and/or disrupted
   cell-cell adhesion, which in turn sensitized tumor spheroids to
   cispiatin-mediated killing in vitro. Our results suggest that
   antiadhesive agents might sensitize tumor spheroids to alkylating agents
   in part by reversing or preventing reduced DNA mismatch repair activity
   and that the chemosensitization properties of 5-azacytidine may
   conceivably reflect its role as a potential antiadhesive agent as well
   as reversal agent for MLH1 gene silencing in human tumors.}},

Abstract = {{Photodegradation of coumaphos and azinphos-methyl in the air, in oxygen,
   and in nitrogen atmosphere (quartz reactor equipped with six 18-W lamps
   with the maximum emission intensity at 310 nm) was studied. The fastest
   reaction occurred with coumaphos in nitrogen atmosphere (complete
   decomposition in 10 min), where the formation of a new compound was also
   detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In the case
   of azinphos-methyl, no additional signals in HPLC chromatogram were
   observed. The rearrangement mechanism, involving a triplet-state
   activation complex and the formation of an acetylcholinesterase
   (AChE)-inhibiting oxo analog of coumaphos was verified and confirmed by
   laser flash photolysis.
   The suitability of bioanalytical flow-injection analysis (FIA) systems,
   based on AChE inhibition and spectrophotometric or thermal lens
   spectrometric detection for rapid and sensitive screening in food
   quality control was demonstrated. Owing to the high sensitivity of
   thermal lens spectrometry (TLS), several steps in sample preparation can
   be avoided (pre-concentration, purification, isolation) and incubation
   times reduced. High sample throughputs (10 h(-1)) are, however, also
   achievable for medium toxic oxo organophosphorus (OP) pesticides using
   spectrophotometric detection providing limits of detection (LODs) at the
   level of 10 ppb malaoxon equivalents, which is still about 50 times
   below maximal residue levels. Testing of the rnethod for practical
   application on a set of 60 samples gave no false negative results and a
   level of 1.7 \% false positives.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to examine whether exogenous somatotropin (ST)
   can alter the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis in the porcine
   epitheliochorial placenta. Crossbred gilts were injected either 6 mg of
   recombinant porcine ST or vehicle from days 10 to 27 after artificial
   insemination (term day 116). Control and ST treated gilts were
   euthanized on day 28 (8 control/5 treated), day 37 (4 control/6
   treated), and day 62 (4 control/6 treated) of gestation. Endometrium and
   placental tissue samples were collected and subjected to mRNA analyses.
   In control gilts, somatotropin receptor (STR) and IGF-I mRNA abundance
   in the endometrium decreased with gestation. Conversely, the amounts of
   IGF-II mRNA and of IGF binding protein (BP)-2 and -3 mRNA, which were
   analyzed in endometrium and placental chorion, increased with gestation.
   The endometrium contained less IGF-II mRNA but more IGFBP-2 and-3 mRNA
   than the placental chorion. In response to pST treatment, the amounts of
   endometrial STR and IGF-I mRNA were lower at days 28 and 37, but higher
   at day 62 of gestation. The content of IGF-II mRNA was higher in the
   endometrium of pST treated than control gilts on day 37. The amount of
   IGFBP-2 mRNA was increased on day 37 in endometrium and placenta of
   pST-treated gilts, whereas no changes in IGFBP-3 mRNA were observed. The
   IGF-II/IGFBP-2 ratio was higher in the placenta in response to pST on
   day 28 of gestation. Results show that pST treatment of pregnant gilts
   during early gestation alters IGF axis in maternal and fetal placental
   tissues and suggest pST may exert an effect on fetal growth by altering
   the relative amount of IGFBPs and IGFs at the fetal-maternal interface.

Abstract = {{Disputes regarding the ethics of work by children have intensified in
   recent years, with little resolution. The impasses stem from failure to
   recognize the diverse forms of child work and a lack of empirical
   research regarding its causes and consequences. We report on data
   gathered in Brazil's export-oriented shoe industry, which is notorious
   for the employment of children. Central findings are: 1) the causes of
   child work have less to do with backwardness and more to do with how
   shoe workers are integrated into the global order; 2) local employers
   and children regard this work as benign, but the U.S. government sees it
   as hazardous to children and unfair to U.S. producers; 3) efforts to
   remove children from the shoe industry have been frustrated by local
   resistance and raise ethical questions; and 4) in certain circumstances,
   efforts to eliminate hazards from the workplace are morally superior to
   campaigns to remove child workers from employment.}},

Abstract = {{We study the role of dislocation loops defects on the elasticity of
   lamellar phases by investigating the variation of the lamella relastic
   constants, (B) over bar and K, induced by the proliferation of the se
   defects. We focus our interest on one particular lamellar phase made up
   of a mixture of C12E5 and DMPC in water, which is already
   well-characterised. This lamellar phase undergoes a second-order (or
   weakly first-order) lamellar-to-nematic phase transition at about 19
   degrees C and dislocation loops are seen to proliferate within the
   lamellar structure when temperature is decreased below 30 degrees C. The
   values of both elastic constants of this given lamellar phase are
   measured as a function of temperature, approaching the
   lamellar-to-nematic transition, with the help of Quasi-Elastic Light
   Scattering (QELS) on oriented lamellar phases. Very surprisingly we
   observe a strong and rapid increase in both B and K as the
   lamellar-to-nematic transition temperature is approached. These
   increases are seen to start as soon as dislocation loops can be observed
   in the lamellar phase. We interpret our results as being the consequence
   of the appearance and proliferation of dislocation loops within the
   lamellar structure. According to a simple model we developped we show
   that B and K are proportional to the density of dislocation loops in the
   lamellar phase.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: This paper argues that focused evaluation studies of
   community-based informational interventions conducted over the
   life-cycle of the project ({''}smallball{''} studies) are more
   informative and useful than randomized experiments conducted only at the
   project's conclusion ({''}powerball{''} studies).
   Method: Based on two contrasting strategies in baseball, smallball and
   powerball studies are compared and contrasted, emphasizing how the
   distinctive features of community-based interventions lend advantage to
   smallball approaches.
   Results: Smallball evaluations have several important advantages over
   powerball evaluations: before system development, they ensure that
   information resources address real community needs; during deployment,
   they ensure that the systems are suited to the capabilities of the users
   and to community constraints; and, after deployment, they enable as much
   as possible to be learned about the effects of the intervention in
   environments where randomized studies are usually impossible.
   Implications: Many in informatics see powerball studies as the only
   legitimate form of evaluation and so expect powerball studies to be
   done. These expectations should be revised in favor of smallball
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{Protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) affects millions of children in the
   developing world. The relationship between malaria and PEM is
   controversial. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether
   undernutrition is associated with increased or decreased malaria
   attributable morbidity. Three cross-sectional surveys were conducted
   using insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) among children aged 0-36
   months living in an area with intense malaria transmission. Data were
   collected on nutritional status, recent history of clinical illness,
   socioeconomic status, current malaria infection status, and hemoglobin.
   In multivariate models, stunted children had more malaria parasitemia
   (odds ratio {[}OR] 1.98, P < 0.0001), high-density parasitemia (OR 1.84;
   P < 0.0001), clinical malaria (OR 1.77; P < 0.06), and severe malarial
   anemia (OR 2.65; P < 0.0001) than nonstunted children. The association
   was evident in children with mild-to-moderate (-3 < height-for-age
   Z-score {[}HAZ] < -2) and severe stunting (HAZ < -3). The
   cross-sectional nature of the study limits the interpretation of
   causality, but the data provide further observational support that the
   presence of undernutrition, in particular chronic undernutrition, places
   children at higher, not lower risk of malaria-related morbidity.}},

Abstract = {{To assess the effects of interactions between angular path integration
   and visual landmarks on the firing of hippocampal neurons, we recorded
   from CA1 pyramidal cells as rats foraged in two identical boxes with
   polarizing internal cues. In the same- orientation condition, following
   an earlier experiment by Skaggs and McNaughton, the boxes were oriented
   identically and connected by a corridor. In the opposite-orientation
   condition, the boxes were abutted by rotating them 90 degrees in
   opposite directions, so that their orientations differed by 180 degrees.
   After 16 - 23 days of pretraining on the same- orientation condition,
   three rats experienced both conditions in counterbalanced order on each
   of two consecutive days. On the third day they ran two
   opposite-orientation trials. Although Skaggs and McNaughton observed
   stable partial `` remapping{''} of place fields, none of the fields in
   this experiment remapped in the same- orientation condition. In the
   opposite-orientation condition, place fields in the first box were
   isomorphic with those in the same- orientation condition, whereas in the
   second box the rats eventually exhibited completely different fields.
   The rats differed as to the trial in which this first occurred. Once the
   second box exhibited different fields, it continued to do so in all
   subsequent opposite- orientation trials, yet fields remained the same in
   subsequent same- orientation trials. The results demonstrate that when
   animals move actively between environments, and are thus potentially
   able to maintain their inertial angular orientation, discordance between
   environmental orientation and the rat's idiothetic direction sense can
   profoundly affect the hippocampal map - either immediately, or as a
   result of cumulative experience.}},

Title = {{Granulosa cell tumor-like variant of endometrioid carcinoma of the ovary
   exhibiting nuclear clearing with biotin activity - A subtype showing
   close macroscopic, cytologic, and histologic similarity to adult
   granulosa cell tumor}},

Abstract = {{Context.-The sex cord-like variant of endometrioid carcinoma of the
   ovary shows many similarities to Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor and granulosa
   cell tumor. However, few cases of the granulosa cell tumor-like variant
   have been reported, suggesting this tumor might often be hidden under
   the diagnosis of granulosa cell tumor.
   Objective.-To investigate the similarities and differences between the
   granulosa cell tumor-like variant of endometrioid carcinoma and
   granulosa cell tumor of the ovary and to evaluate a newly observed
   feature, namely, nuclear clearing (or optically clear nuclei), in this
   variant tumor.
   Design.-A comparative macroscopic, cytologic, histopathologic, and
   immunohistochemical study in specimens obtained from the following
   patients: 1 patient with granulosa cell tumor-like variant of
   endometrioid carcinoma diagnosed by frozen section examination, 3
   patients with granulosa cell tumor, and 6 patients with classic
   endometrioid carcinoma.
   Results.-The granulosa cell tumor-like variant showed close macroscopic,
   cytologic, and microscopic similarities to granulosa cell tumor.
   However, the 2 tumors could be differentiated immunohistochemically. The
   former also showed intense staining for progesterone receptors and
   contained nonmorular nests that exhibited the so-called nuclear clearing
   with biotin activity.
   Conclusion.-Because the granulosa cell tumor-like variant is
   pathologically similar to granulosa cell tumor, showing only,some
   dissimilarities to the latter, it can easily be misdiagnosed if the
   possibility of this variant Is not kept in mind. Identification of the
   typical endometrioid histologic features or related lesions or
   immunohistochemistry may lead to a proper diagnosis. The observation of
   nuclear clearing with biotin activity-in nonmorular nests suggests that
   this tumor has endometrioid epithelial characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Nup98 is a component of nuclear pore complexes, which are large protein
   assemblies embedded in the nuclear envelope. Previous studies have shown
   that Nup98 interacts with several transport factors and plays a critical
   part in nuclear trafficking. However, the mechanism by which Nup98
   contributes to nuclear trafficking is not clear. The present study
   reports on the preparation of a monoclonal antibody (MAb) directed
   against human Nup98. The antibody was produced by the hybridization of
   mouse myeloma cells with lymph node cells from an immunized rat. This
   antibody, MAb 21110, specifically recognized Nup98, as evidenced by
   immunoblotting using a nuclear membrane fraction. In immunostaining
   using MAb 21110, a punctuate nuclear rim staining pattern was observed.
   This MAb will be useful in immunoblotting and immunolocalization
   experiments in various cells and tissues, as well as further analyses of
   the biological function and cellular dynamics of this protein.}},

Abstract = {{We designed a fluorescent peptide-magnetic nanoparticle conjugate that
   images E-selectin expression in mouse xenograft models of Lewis lung
   carcinoma (LLC) by fluorescence reflectance imaging. It was synthesized
   by attaching the E-selectin-binding peptide (ESBP; CDSDSDITWDOLWDLMK) to
   a CLIO(Cy5.5) nanoparticle to yield ESBP-CLIO(Cy5.5). Internalization by
   activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was rapid and
   mediated by E-selectin, indicated by the lack of uptake of nanoparticles
   bearing similar numbers of a scrambled peptide (Scram). To demonstrate
   the specificity of E-selectin targeting to ESBP-CLIO(Cy5.5) in vivo, we
   coinjected ESBP-CLIO (Cy5.5) and Scram-CLIO(Cy3.5) and demonstrated a
   high Cy5.5/Cy3.5 fluorescence ratio using the LLC. Histology showed that
   ESBP-CLIO was associated with tumor cells as well as endothelial cells,
   but fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis showed a far less
   expression of E-selectin on LLC than on HUVECs. Using
   immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated E-selectin expression in both
   endothelial cells and cancer cells in human prostate cancer specimens.
   We conclude that ESBP-CLIO (Cy5.5) is a useful probe for imaging
   E-selectin associated with the LLC tumor, and that E-selectin is
   expressed not only on endothelial cells but also on LLC cells and human
   prostate cancer specimens.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the interrelationship between fosterage, school
   attendance, and children's employment in Ghana. Using the 1991/1992
   Living Standards Survey data on children aged 7 - 17 years and a
   trivariate probit model, the paper demonstrates that ignoring the
   linkages between these outcomes leads to downward-biased estimates of
   the impact of fosterage on schooling and upward-biased estimates of the
   impact of fosterage on work. Gender and age are important considerations
   in family decisions regarding children's activities. Joint decision-
   making is more common for girls aged 12 - 17 than for boys of a similar
   age. A significant negative correlation is also observed between the
   likelihood of employment and the likelihood of school attendance among
   adolescent girls.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To evaluate the reliability (intertrial, interevaluator) and
   the concurrent validity of strength measurements obtained with a
   chair-fixed dynamometer and to recommend a clinical protocol that
   minimizes standard error of measurement (SEM).
   Design: Within-session repeated measures of maximal static strength of
   knee flexors and extensors at 30 degrees and 60 degrees of flexion on
   the chair-fixed and Cybex dynamometers. Setting: Ambulatory
   physiotherapy department of a rehabilitation hospital.
   Participants: Convenience sample of 50 subjects with total hip (n=25) or
   knee (n=25) arthroplasty.
   Interventions: Not applicable.
   Main Outcome Measures: Reliability was quantified by indices of
   dependability and corresponding SEMs estimated with the generalizability
   theory, whereas coefficients of correlation were used to assess the
   validity.
   Results: Indices of dependability confirmed excellent intertrial
   (0.98-1.00) and a very good interevaluator (.92-99) reliability for the
   strength measures obtained for different movements and positions. An
   average of 3 trials minimized the magnitude of the SEMs (> 2Nm for all
   measurements). When comparing the strength values obtained with the
   Cybex dynamometer to those measured with the chair-fixed dynamometer,
   strongest relations were attained when the tested knee was positioned at
   60 degrees compared with 30 degrees for subjects with a total knee
   (.78-92 vs.87-93) or hip (33-85 vs.86-91) arthroplasty.
   Conclusions: A clinical protocol averaging 3 trials with the knee
   positioned at 60 degrees after a familiarization period. both for knee
   flexors and extensors, performed by a trained therapist is recommended
   to minimize measurement errors on strength values measured with the
   chair-fixed dynamometer.}},

Abstract = {{There remains concern that survey research after a disaster can

   surveyed 5,774 persons in three random-digit-dial telephone surveys of
   the general population of New York City conducted 1-2 months, 4-5
   months, and 6-9 months after the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001.
   Overall, 746 (12.9\%) people who finished the surveys said that the
   survey questions were upsetting but only 57 (1.0\% overall) were still
   upset at the end of the interview, and 19 (0.3\%) wanted assistance from
   a counselor. Ten persons who did not finish the survey also received
   counselor assistance. Persons with mental health symptoms were more
   likely to find the survey questions emotionally upsetting as were
   participants who lacked salutary resources, including health insurance
   and a regular health care provider. Although relatively few of those
   interviewed found the survey assessment disturbing, the presence of a
   small number of respondents who wanted mental health assistance suggests
   the need for a mental health backup system for research conducted soon
   after exposure to large-scale traumatic events.}},

Abstract = {{Condensed organic matter with higher affinity for hydrophobic organic
   compounds (HOC) is currently held responsible for slow desorption and
   concomitant lower bioavailabilities of HOC in sediments and soils. In an
   experiment with Daphnia magna and IHSS Peat Humic Acid (PHA), we showed
   that the bioconcentration factor (BCF) of 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl
   (PCB-77) was directly related to the charge of the humic colloid, as
   predicted by the metal-humic binding model WHAM. Consistent with the
   type of binding to the humic acid (counter-ion accumulation vs. specific
   binding), increasing the concentration of Na+ and Ca2+ ions generated
   opposite effects on colloid charge and HOC binding by the humic acid.
   Condensation as a colloidal phenomenon in solution as well as on
   surfaces needs to be addressed as a contributor to lower
   bioavailabilities and, possibly, to slower desorption kinetics. (C) 2005

Abstract = {{It has been reported that stress can alter nociception from superficial
   tissues, such as skin and subcutaneous region. However, the influence of
   stress on an experimental deep nociception model is not understood. In
   this study, the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) formalin test was used to
   evaluate the effects of acute and chronic restraint stress on
   nociceptive responses in rats. Animals were initially submitted to one
   session of acute restraint stress (1 h) or exposed to chronic stress (40
   days-1 h/day). Then, animals were killed immediately to collect blood
   for hormonal determinations by radioimmunoassay, or submitted to the TMJ
   formalin test to evaluate nociception. Rats submitted to acute restraint
   presented a performance similar to unstressed controls in the TMJ
   formalin test, whereas chronically stressed rats showed an increase in
   nociceptive responses. After 40 days of restraint, morphine was injected
   i.p. (1, 5 mg/kg or saline). The stressed rats displayed decreased
   morphine effects on nociception compared to unstressed controls. These
   findings suggest that repeated stress can produce hyperalgesia, which
   is, at least in part, due to alterations in the activity of opioid
   systems. This model may help elucidate the underlying neural mechanisms
   that mediate the effects of repeated stress on orofacial pain. (C) 2005

Abstract = {{Nitric oxide (NO) is known to be involved in many physiological
   reactions of insects. We analysed NOS localisation in aphids of the
   species Megoura viciae by means of histochemical reaction for the
   NADPH-diaphorase activity and immunohistochemical methods for uNOS, nNOS
   and iNOS. The obtained data provided a complex and peculiar pattern of
   NOS distribution in cells and tissue of M. viciae.The histochemical
   reaction for NADPH-diaphorase was an indicative, but not exact marker of
   NOS localisation in aphids. The use of anti uNOS antiserum (frequently
   applied in insects) was of limited value in our specimens, whereas more
   satisfactory results were obtained with anti nNOS and iNOS antisera of
   human origin. The results of Western blot analysis confirmed the
   immunohistochemical ones, showing an aphid protein that reacted strongly
   with the polyclonal antibody anti-iNOS and anti-nNOS while a similar
   protein band was weakly immunoreactive with the polyclonal antibody
   anti-uNOS. Our results suggest that NO, prevalently synthesised by
   calcium/calmodulin-dependent isoform, plays important physiological
   roles both in adult and embryological stages of aphids. The data of
   principal interest was NOS presence in bacteriocytes, cells that host
   symbiotic prokaryotes belonging to the species Buchnera aphidicola, and
   in nuclei of adipocytes and gut cells.}},

Abstract = {{Considerable advances have been made over the past decade in developing
   and adapting instruments to measure cognitive functioning in individuals
   with a wide range of educational and racial/ethnic backgrounds in
   different countries. Similar approaches can be used to extend these
   assessments to groups that have not yet been Studied. The critical
   issues are to ensure that methods are appropriately harmonized to the
   local context, that local norms are established, and that local
   expertise is brought to bear in instrument development/adaptation.
   Effective instruments are also available to screen for depression in the
   elderly but closer attention should be made to possible ethnic
   differences in item response on these scales. The ideal screening tool
   should be quick, inexpensive, painless, and socially/culturally
   acceptable to the Population. It Should also have desirable psychometric
   properties. Examples are provided from several international studies.
   The context, costs, and objectives of screening a given population
   should be considered when selecting a screening instrument and a
   threshold on the scale, whether for clinical or research purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives Plasma volume expansion may benefit both mother and child in
   the temporising management of severe and early onset hypertensive
   disorders of pregnancy.
   Design Randomised clinical trial.
   Setting Two university hospitals in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
   Population Two hundred and sixteen patients with a gestational age
   between 24 and 34 completed weeks with severe pre-eclampsia, haemolysis,
   elevated liver enzymes and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome or severe
   fetal growth restriction (FGR) with pregnancy-induced hypertension,
   admitted between 1 April 2000 and 31 May 2003.
   Methods One hundred and eleven patients were randomly allocated to the
   treatment group, (plasma volume expansion and a diastolic BP target of
   85-95 mmHg) and 105 to the control group (intravenous fluid restriction
   and BP target of 95-105 mmHg).
   Main outcome measures Neonatal neurological development at term age
   (Prechtl score), perinatal death, neonatal morbidity and maternal
   morbidity.
   Results Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups. The
   median gestational age was 30 weeks. In the treatment group, patients
   received higher amounts of intravenous fluids (median 813 mL/day vs 14
   mL/day; P < 0.001) with a concomitant decreased haemoglobin count
   (median -0.6 vs-0.2 mmol/L; P < 0.001). Neither neurological scores nor
   composite neonatal morbidity differed. A trend towards less prolongation
   of pregnancy (median 7.4 vs 11.5 days; P= 0.054) and more infants
   requiring oxygen treatment > 21\% (66 vs 46; P= 0.09) in the treatment
   group was observed. There was no difference in major maternal morbidity
   (total 11\%), but there were more caesarean sections in the treatment
   group (98\%vs 90\%; P < 0.05).
   Conclusion The addition of plasma volume expansion in temporising
   treatment does not improve maternal or fetal outcome in women with early
   preterm hypertensive complications of pregnancy.}},

Abstract = {{Marketers often use verbal claims to highlight brand benefits in
   marketing communication campaigns. However, spokescharacters may also be
   incorporated into campaigns and are often featured both in
   advertisements and on product packages. The authors use three studies to
   examine various integrated marketing communications (IMC) strategic
   combinations, including the effects related to the use of
   spokescharacters versus verbal attributes; advertisement-package
   coordination; character relevancy; and the presence of new, favorable
   brand information that may compete for cognitive resources on packages.
   Based on conceptual rationales drawn from encoding specificity, network
   associations, and the elaboration likelihood model, the findings offer
   empirical evidence that pertains to the potential benefits of including
   spokescharacters in IMC campaigns. Specifically, the use of
   spokescharacters results in more favorable brand attitudes, even when
   brand attribute recall is affected adversely by deviations from the
   primary message conveyed in the IMC campaigns. The authors offer some
   implications of these and other findings for marketers attempting to
   affect consumer evaluations favorably with spokescharacters in IMC

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Three different experiments were designed to study the effects of N
   fertilizer rate, timing and splitting, and the response to combined
   application of N and S fertilizer on the quality of durum wheat
   (Triticum turgidum L.) over a 3-year period in Vertisols under rainfed
   Mediterranean conditions. The following parameters were analyzed: grain
   yield, test weight, grain protein concentration, gluten index, yellow
   index, ash content and vitreousness. The N rate experiment included
   rates of 0, 100, 150, and 200 kg N ha(-1) carried out on 4 different
   sites. The experiment was designed as a randomized complete block with
   four blocks. For the experiment on N timing and splitting, a single rate
   of 150 kg N hat was used, different fractions being applied at sowing,
   tillering and stem elongation, at a single site; again, experimental
   design was a randomized complete block with four blocks. Finally, for
   the experiment on the response to combined application of N and S
   fertilizer, a single fertilizer dose of 150 kg N ha(-1) was applied in
   two forms (urea + ammonium nitrate and urea + ammonium nitrosulfate)
   with one leaf application at ear emergence (zero, 25 kg S ha(-1), 25 kg
   N ha(-1), 25 kg S ha(-1) + 25 kg N ha(-1), and 50 kg N ha(-1)), also at
   a single site, using a split-plot design with four replications.
   Year-on-year variation in rainfall led to marked variations in wheat
   yield, grain protein concentration and quality indices. Rainfall and
   temperatures during grain formation and ripening (April and May) were
   critical for durum wheat quality. N fertilizer rate modified the
   behavior pattern of some quality indices as a function of climate, and
   had a more consistent effect on durum wheat quality than on grain yield.
   The highest values for grain yield were recorded at an N rate of 100 kg
   ha(-1), while maximum grain protein concentration values were recorded
   at 200 kg ha(-1). Increasing N rates also prompted an increase in
   vitreous kernel count, which was highest at 150 kg N ha(-1). The timing
   and splitting of N fertilizer had no clear effect on either grain yield
   or quality indices. Leaf application of N at ear emergence increased
   only grain protein concentration, vitreous kernel count and grain ash
   content. Soil or leaf application of S had no effect on quality indices,
   with the exception of ash content, which rose with leaf application at
   ear emergence. The response of grain yield and grain protein
   concentration to fertilizer N differed from that reported for temperate
   climates. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective - To determine whether cholesteryl ester transfer protein (
   CETP) directly mediates selective uptake of high-density lipoprotein
   (HDL)-cholesteryl ester (CE) by hepatocytes and to quantify the effects
   of the CETP inhibitor, torcetrapib, on this process.
   Methods and Results - Using adenovirus-mediated CETP (ad-CETP)
   expression in primary mouse hepatocytes from either wild-type,
   low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor -/- or SR- BI -/- mice, we
   demonstrate that CETP enhances the selective accumulation of HDL-derived
   H-3-CE independently of known lipoprotein receptors. Addition of
   torcetrapib to the media did not impair the ability of cell-associated
   CETP to enhance CE uptake but reduced the ability of exogenously added
   CETP to increase selective uptake by up to 80\%. When mice were infected
   with ad-CETP or ad-Luciferase and treated with daily intravenous
   injections of torcetrapib or vehicle, hepatic CETP expression resulted
   in a 50\% decrease in HDL cholesterol in vehicle-treated animals versus
   a 33\% decrease in HDL cholesterol in mice treated with torcetrapib.
   Conclusions - CETP mediates selective uptake of HDL- CE by hepatocytes
   by both torcetrapib-sensitive ( exogenous CETP) and
   torcetrapib-insensitive (cell-associated CETP) mechanisms. Hepatic
   expression of CETP in vivo results in a marked decrease in cholesterol
   in particles in the HDL density range, consistent with a physiological
   role for hepatocyte CETP in selective uptake.}},

Abstract = {{History supplied Schiller with most of the topics of his tragic novels
   which themselves were picked up by composers and then celebrated
   successes as historic operas in the nineteenth century. However,
   Schiller himself never finished an opera libretto. Until now, it has
   been neglected what central role this new literary genre played since
   the 1780ies. This article aims at discovering and analysing why
   Schiller's project, writing Libretti, has remained fragmentarily.

Abstract = {{A novel equivalent instantaneous inductance (EM-based scheme is proposed
   to distinguish the inrush current from internal faults in power
   transformers, which is derived from the inherent difference of the
   magnetic permeability, due to the saturation and unsaturation, in the
   transformer iron core between the inrush current and an internal fault.
   First, the EII that represents these differences is defined, and its
   calculation methods and the criteria to identify the internal fault in
   the time and frequency domains are respectively developed. A total of 98
   experimental cases are used to test the performance of the technique. In
   all of the tests, the inrush current is characterized by the drastic
   variation of the EII, but the EII of the faulty phase is kept almost
   constant. The experimental results verify the dependability, security,
   and fast operation of the proposed scheme. Besides, its easy
   implementation in real time is another advantage of the proposed method
   because of its simplicity.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of intermediate annealings on the microstructure, the
   strength and the electrical resistivity of deformation-processed Cu-Fe
   in-situ composites were studied. The results show that intermediate
   annealings favour the formation of uniform tiny fibres from the iron
   dendrites but they have no obvious effect on the strength of the
   composite. The bigger the strain is, the higher the strength is. As the
   strain increases, the resistivity increases due to the increase of
   interface density. Intermediate annealings result in notable decreasing
   resistivity due to the precipitation of the iron atoms from the Cu
   matrix and decrease of solute scattering resistivity. The doping with Zr
   improves the strength of the composite slightly and the ultimate tensile
   strength(UTS) increases about 10\%. The colligated performances of
   deformation-processed Cu-11.5\% Fe and Cu-11.5\% Fe Zr composites at
   strain eta = 5.37 are 64.6\% IACS/752 MPa and 61.4\% IACS/824 MPa

Abstract = {{Background: Gram stain is used to detect urethral inflammation,
   suggestive of infection, in men and guide therapeutic decisions. In the
   absence of signs, symptoms, or pollymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) on
   urethral Gram stain, treatment and sometimes testing is deferred.
   Goal: Determine the proportion of men with chlamydia or gonorrhea
   diagnosed by nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) or culture who
   lack Gram stain evidence of inflammation and compare their clinical
   characteristics to men with inflammation.
   Methods: Records from 2629 men presenting for routine sexually
   transmitted disease care with urethral PMN count and NAAT data were
   retrospectively analyzed. A subpopulation tested by NAAT and culture was
   analyzed. Men receiving antibiotics within the prior month or those
   reporting a sexual partner with trichomoniasis were excluded.
   Results: Among 2266 eligible men, 353 (16\%) had chlamydia and 462
   (20\%) had gonorrhea. Among chlamydia-infected men, PMNs per
   oil-immersion field (oif) on Gram stain were >= 5 in 291 (82\%), 1 to 4
   in 20 (6\%), and none in 42 (12\%). In men with gonorrhea, PMNs/oif were
   >= 5 in 433 (94\%), 1 to 4 in 6 (1\%), and none in 23 (5\%). Urethral
   symptoms, discharge, and/or >= 5 PMNs/oif were absent in 47 (13\%) and.
   22 (5\%) of chlamydial and gonococcal infections, respectively
   (including no PMNs/oif and 1-4 PMNs/oif). None of these 47
   chlamydial-infected men and only 4 of 22 men with gonorrhea received
   therapy at the time of initial examination.
   Conclusions: Twelve percent of chlamydial and 5\% of gonococcal
   infections had no Gram stain evidence of urethral inflammation. Absence
   of symptoms and discharge is not uncommon in chlamydial infection
   detected by NAAT, and without testing, many infections will go
   untreated, furthering the possibility of complications or partner
   transmission.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Estimates of the prevalence of psoriatic arthritis vary
   widely and are usually not determined by population-based studies.
   Objectives. We sought to determine the prevalence of psoriatic arthritis
   and the impact of the disease on quality of life in the US population.
   Methods: Patients were selected randomly from the US population and were
   interviewed by telephone. Cases were defined as patients who reported a
   physician diagnosis of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.
   Results: Interviews of 27,220 persons were conducted; 601 of the
   interviewees had psoriasis and 71 had psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.
   The prevalence of psoriatic arthritis was 0.25\% (95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI]: 0.18\%, 0.31\%). The prevalence of psoriatic arthritis
   among patients with psoriasis was 11\% (95\% CI: 9\%, 14\%) and varied
   substantially based on self-reporting of the extent of skin involvement
   with psoriasis. Thirty-nine percent of patients with psoriatic arthritis
   indicated that it was a large problem in everyday life.
   Limitations: Psoriatic arthritis was classified on the basis of the
   patient's self-report.
   Conclusion: Psoriatic arthritis affects an estimated 520,000 patients in
   the US population, and many rate it as a large problem in everyday life.
   The prevalence varies widely based on the extent of skin involvement,
   which demonstrates the importance of performing broadly representative
   studies to measure the prevalence of psoriatic arthritis.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper the humidity sensing properties of layers, prepared by a
   new method for obtaining doped tin oxide - the vacuum co-deposition of
   TeO2 and Sn, are studied. The as-deposited layers are amorphous with
   great specific area and low density. They are built up of a fine grained
   matrix, consisting of oxides of Sri and Te, and a nanosized dispersed
   phase of Te, Sri and/or SnTe. The chemical composition of both the
   matrix and the nanosized particles depends on the ratio Sn/Te and the
   evaporation conditions. It is shown that as-deposited layers with
   Sn/Tc-ratio approximate to 0.7 - 0.9 exhibit excellent characteristics
   as humidity sensors operating at room temperature - very high
   sensitivity, fast response and a very short recovery period. No
   hysteresis effects are observed. Accelerated ageing tests have shown
   that the layers possess a good long-term stability. The influence of a
   number of parameters (layer composition and thickness, thermal
   pre-treatment, material of the substrate and electrodes, etc.) is
   discussed.}},

   asymptotic complexity is bounded by O(n(7)) but its behavior seems to be
   linear in practice. It uses an original strategy of optimization in a

Abstract = {{Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have extensive selfrenewal capacity
   and are competent to differentiate into any cell type of the body. They
   are valuable not only for the study of early human development but also
   for regenerative medicine. However, how to direct differentiation of
   hESCs along a particular lineage pathway to a specific cell type remains
   a challenge. Although hESCs have been shown to differentiate in vitro
   into neural progenitors, the factors controlling their differentiation
   are poorly understood. In this study, we report the development of an in
   vitro adherent culture system to efficiently generate neural progenitors
   in which neither multicellular aggregates nor stromal cells are
   required. We show that inhibition of bone morphogenetic protein
   signaling by its antagonist noggin is sufficient to block extraembryonic
   cell fate, transiently sustain Oct4 gene expression, and result in
   robust production of neural progenitors. Our findings will provide a
   platform for studying the molecular mechanism controlling neural
   differentiation.}},

Abstract = {{Nanophase aluminum powder was characterized in a field-emission-gun
   transmission electron microscope (TEM). Different techniques were used
   to investigate the structure of the particles, including conventional
   bright-field and dark-field imaging, scanning transmission electron
   microscopy (STEM), high-resolution lattice imaging, diffraction studies,
   energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis and mapping, and
   electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis and mapping. It has
   been established that the particle cores consist of aluminum single
   crystals that sometimes contain crystal lattice defects. The core is
   covered by a passivating layer of aluminum oxide a few nanometers thick.
   The alumina is mostly amorphous, but evidences of partial crystallinity
   of the oxide were also found. The thickness of this layer was measured
   using different techniques, and the results are in good agreement with
   each other. The particles are agglomerated in two distinct ways. Some
   particles were apparently bonded together during processing before
   oxidation. These mostly form dumbbells covered by a joint oxide layer.
   Also, oxidized particles are loosely assembled into relatively large
   clusters.}},

Abstract = {{This research was conducted to determine formaldehyde exposure of staffs
   in pathology laboratories, surgery rooms and endoscopy wards in eight
   large hospitals of Tehran University of Medical Sciences located at
   Tehran, Iran. Air sampling have been made by both long and short-term
   methods. Total numbers of samples were 160 for both methods. Nineteen
   samples of 160 samples were collected as blank in other non-exposed
   environments such as administrative sections. The mean (SD) levels of
   formaldehyde in long-term methods were 0.96 (0.74), 0.25 (0.21) and 0.13
   (0.18) ppm, at pathology laboratories, surgery rooms and endoscopy
   wards, respectively. The results of measurements showed that mean (SD)
   concentration of formaldehyde in one hour sampling at short intervals
   were 0.83 (0.29), 0.23 (0.16) and 0.75 (0.25) ppm at pathology labs,
   surgery rooms and endoscopy wards, respectively. There were significant
   differences in the mean levels of formaldehyde (long-term) at surgery
   rooms (p < 0.02) and endoscopy wards (p < 0.005) in eight hospitals of
   this study. It is concluded that the concentration levels of
   formaldehyde at pathology laboratories exceeded recommended limit which
   established by the American Conference of Governmental and Industrial
   Hygienists ACGIH (TLV-C=0.3 ppm). It is recommended that local exhaust
   ventilation should be installed to minimize the contact to formaldehyde

Abstract = {{Purpose Bec2 is an anti-idiotypic antibody that mimics GD3, a
   ganglioside that is expressed on the surface of tumor cells and is of
   neuroectodermal origin. We assessed whether Bec2/bacille Calmette-Guerin
   (BCG) vaccination prolongs survival in patients with limited-disease
   small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) after a major response to chemotherapy and
   chest radiation.
   Patients and Methods Patients were randomly assigned to receive five
   vaccinations of Bec2 (2.5 mg)/BCG vaccine or follow-up. Vaccination was
   given over a 10-week period. The sample size was targeted to detect an
   increase in median survival of 40\% after random assignment, and
   stratification was by performance status, response, and institution.
   Quality of life was assessed by using the European Organisation for
   Research and Treatment of Cancer instrument. Humoral response was
   assessed in patients who received vaccination.
   Results A total of 515 patients were randomly assigned. The primary
   toxicities of vaccination were transient skin ulcerations and mild
   flu-like symptoms. There was no improvement in survival,
   progression-free survival, or quality of life in the vaccination arm.
   Median survival from randomization was 16.4 and 14.3 months in the
   observation and vaccination arms (P =.28), respectively. Among
   vaccinated patients, a trend toward prolonged survival was observed in
   those (one third) who developed a humoral response (P =.085).
   Multivariate analysis showed a positive impact on survival by prior
   treatment with concomitant chemoradiotherapy, prophylactic cranial
   irradiation, female sex, low lactate clehydrogenase, and normal
   platelets.
   Conclusion Vaccination with Bec2/BCG has no impact on outcome of
   patients with limited-disease SCLC responding to combined-modality
   treatment. Vaccination strategies in SCLC may still be warranted using
   vaccines that produce a better immunologic response.}},

Abstract = {{Patients with extremely high triglyceride levels and associated lipemia

   both may exist simultaneously. Causes can be either primary or
   secondary. Plasmapheresis is efficacious for severe hypertryceridemia in
   patients who have not responded to previous, therapies.
   We have treated 15 cases of hypertrygliceridemia complicating the course
   of patients receiving Cyclosporin A after bone marrow transplantation.
   Five patients were treated with plasmapheresis, the other ten with
   cascade filtration. The removal rate for triglycerides was 58.0\% for
   patients treated by cascade filtration and 63.5\% for patients treated
   by plasmapheresis. The removal rates for triglycerides were low possibly
   as a consequence of early saturation of the filter.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Porphyromonas gingivalis is a primary etiologic agent of
   generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP), and gingipains, a group of
   cysteine proteinases, are critical virulence factors expressed by this
   organism. GAgP patients develop specific antibodies to gingipains;
   however, the function of these antibodies in the clearance of P.
   gingivalis infection is poorly understood.
   Methods: In this study, we defined the levels of gingipain-specific
   antibodies in GAgP patient sera and examined the ability of
   gingipain-specific antibodies to facilitate opsonophagocytosis of P.
   gingivalis by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) using a
   fluorescent phagocytosis assay.
   Results: GAgP patient sera possessed elevated levels of P. gingivalis-,
   arginine-gingipain (Rgp)A-, RgpB-, and lysine-gingipain (Kgp)-specific
   IgG (Kgp > RgpA > P. gingivalis > RgpB). Adsorption of GAgP sera with P.
   gingivalis whole organisms, RgpA, RgpB, and Kgp conjugated to sepharose
   beads reduced opsonophagocytosis of P. gingivalis by PMNs.
   Conclusions: Our studies demonstrate that GAgP patient sera possess
   elevated levels of P. gingivalis- and gingipain-specific IgG.
   Furthermore, we show that gingipain antibodies promote uptake of P.
   gingivalis by PMNs, and our data suggest that gingipain-specific
   antibodies may be important for the control of P. gingivalis infections.}},

Abstract = {{FastOpt's new automatic differentiation tool TAF is applied to the
   two-dimensional Navier-Stokes solver NSC2KE. For a configuration that
   simulates the Euler flow around an NACA airfoil, TAF has generated the
   tangent linear and adjoint models as well as the second derivative
   (Hessian) code. Owing to TAF's capability of generating efficient
   adjoints of iterative solvers, the derivative code has a high
   performance: running both the solver and its adjoint requires 3.4 times
   as long as running the solver only. Further examples of highly efficient
   tangent linear, adjoint, and Hessian codes for large and complex
   three-dimensional Fortran 77-90 climate models are listed. These
   examples suggest that the performance of the NSC2KE adjoint may well be
   generalised to more complex three-dimensional CFD codes. We also sketch
   how TAF can improve the adjoint's performance by exploiting
   self-adjointness, which is a common feature of CFD codes. (c) 2004

   outbreaks of STEC O157 infection in England and Wales were independently
   associated with farms, which related to milk and milk products, and with
   red meats/meat products, which highlighted butchers' shops as a cause

Abstract = {{Geophysical surveys and drilling of deep wells have recently led to the
   recognition of underlying Precambrian basement, and to an interpretation
   of the structural evolution of the Congo Basin. Deformation estimated as
   Late Cambrian to Early Ordovician corresponds to the late Pan-African
   event more accurately dated as end-early Cambrian in West Africa.
   Subsequently, Paleozoic deformation led to widespread erosion and the
   development of a marked regional unconformity. The 1000-m-thick mostly
   continental deposition during the Cretaceous and Tertiary did not
   involve a noticeable subsidence process. There was no volcanism during
   this deposition, except at the Early Cretaceous, with the advent of
   kimberlites that are distributed over the border of the Cuvette. As a
   consequence most of the diamonds were transported northward or southward
   from upstream sources.
   The Mesozoic sediments of the Congo Basin were formed in lacustrine or
   lagoonal basins close to the sea level as demonstrated by some
   intercalations with marine fossils. In the eastern part of the basin, a
   limited marine connection during the Kimmeridgian was only possible with
   a gulf belonging to the young Indian Ocean. In southern Kasai, the same
   Kimmeridgian transgression is observed. In the northern part of the
   basin, a probable Cenomanian marine connection was suggested between the
   Tethys and the South Atlantic, and the marine deposition at Kipala
   suggests a connection with the Trans-Saharan corridor during the Late
   Cretaceous.
   The geometry of the continental Mesozoic and Cenozoic deposits begins
   with beds overlying a widespread planation level unconformity and/or the
   presence of gravel or conglomerate in the lower portion. The Sables
   Ocres Series and the Gres Polymorphes Series rest on the planation
   levels of Late Cretaceous and mid-Tertiary ages respectively. Mechanical
   composition and morphoscopic characters argue for a dominant eolian
   transport for the Gres Polymorphes and for a fluvial deposition for the
   Sables Ocres. The silicification process achieves its maximum extent
   during the Paleogene interval characterised by a micaceous mineral rich
   clay fraction in the Congo basin sediments. This process stopped at the
   beginning of the Neogene interval when the kaolinitic component
   increased significantly. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Death through apoptosis is the main process by which aged cells that
   have lost their function are eliminated. Apoptotic cells are usually
   detected microscopically by changes in their morphology. However,
   determination of early apoptotic events is important for in vitro (and
   ex vivo) studies. The main objective of the present study is to find the
   most sensitive method for apoptosis detection in human peripheral blood
   mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by comparing six different methods following
   five different means of immunological stimulation at 3 and 5 days. Each
   of six apoptosis quantification methods, except the trypan blue
   exclusion test, is a combination of two stains, one for the specific
   detection of apoptotic cells and the other for the unspecific detection
   of dead cells. Values for apoptosis and mortality were compared with a
   reference method. The choice of apoptosis detection method is more
   important following 3 days of stimulation than after 5 days of
   stimulation (P = 2 x 10(-6) versus P = 1 x 10(-2)). In contrast, we find
   mortality measurements following the different means of stimulation
   highly significant at both 3 and 5 days (F-2.28 = 7.9, P = 1.4 x 10(-6)
   at 3 days and F-2.28 = 8.5, P = 4.5 x 10(-7) at 5 days). Variation as a
   result of the combination of specific PBMC stimulation and the method
   used to detect apoptosis is reduced considerably with time (F-1.58 +
   3.7, P + 3 x 10(-7) at 3 days to F = (1.58) = 0.97, P = 0.5 at 5 days).
   Based on Tukey's test, YO-PRO-1 is the most sensitive stain for
   apoptosis and, when combined with 7-AAD, provides an accurate measure of
   apoptosis and mortality. In conclusion, we propose YO-PRO-1/7-AAD as a
   new combination and low-cost alternative for the sensitive detection of
   early apoptosis.}},

Abstract = {{Metabolic abilities and micrfiobial community structure were
   investigated through three semiarid Mediterranean soils of SE Spain. The
   soils were (1) a Typic Calcixerept under an adult pine plantation (PP),
   growing on abandoned agricultural terraces; (2) a Typic Calcixeroll
   under a native pinewood (NP); and (3) a Typic Haploxerept covered with a
   grass steppe (GS). PP and NP were similar as regards their genesis, but
   the former used to be tilled. NP and GS were undisturbed and supported
   natural and seminatural vegetation, respectively. Seven samples in 10-cm
   depth increments were taken in triplicate along each soil profile.
   Community-level physiological profiles based on sole-C-source use were
   determined to characterize the metabolic abilities. A 16S rDNA
   polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis
   analysis was performed to investigate the microbial genetic structure.
   Plant cover and land-use history were major determinants of microbial
   community structure. Microbial communities residing in soils under a
   native pinewood, the most diverse and stable plant cover, were the most
   complex both metabolically and genetically. The microbial community
   structure distinctly changed with depth, related to the quantity and
   quality of total organic carbon. Both undisturbed soils showed falling
   gradients of metabolic and genetic complexity, which were invariably of
   a greater magnitude in the mature woodland than in the grass steppe. In
   the planted pinewood, however, the substrate-use diversity increased
   with depth, apparently a response to the depleted metabolic abilities
   within its upper layer (0-30 cm). Tilling and plant cover removal might
   be responsible for such a perturbation. In the same profile, molecular
   fingerprint patterns of the topsoil layer (0-10 cm) indicated a
   disturbed genetic structure that might underlie the loss of metabolic
   abilities. However, the genetic structure of the deeper layers of the
   planted and native pinewoods was not dissimilar, revealing that
   equivalent genetic resources perform different environmental functions
   under changing soil scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{We study the effect of photothermal fluctuations on squeezed states of
   light through the photo-refractive effect and thermal expansion in a
   degenerate optical parametric oscillator (OPO). We also discuss the
   effect of the photothermal noise in various cases and how to minimize
   its undesirable consequences. We find that the photothermal noise in the
   OPO introduces a significant amount of noise on phase squeezed beams,
   making them less than ideal for low-frequency applications such as
   gravitational wave (GW) interferometers, whereas amplitude squeezed
   beams are relatively immune to the photothermal noise and may represent
   the best choice for application in GW interferometers.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Fire ant stings lead to significant morbidity and mortality
   each year. Virtually no information exists in the scientific literature
   about the effectiveness of personal protection measures against these
   ants.
   Objectives: To quantify the level of protection from ant stings by socks
   and cotton tights and to evaluate the efficacy of repellents and other
   chemicals in preventing stings.
   Methods: Commercially obtained infant socks were fitted on a plastic
   doll's foot, which was touched to fire ant mounds in a series of
   controlled experiments. Socks and cotton tights were stretched over a
   human finger and placed in a fire ant mound to test the ability of ants
   to sting through fabric. Assays were developed to screen chemical
   substances for their ability to stop or prevent fire ant stings.
   Results: Socks of any type reduced the number of fire ants that reached
   the skin and delayed the time required for ants to reach the skin above
   the sock level. Fire ants were unable to sting through all socks tested.
   Ants successfully stung both paper towels and human skin, regardless of
   chemical substance or repellent applied to them.
   Conclusions: Socks provide some degree of protection from fire ant
   stings; therefore, children living in fire ant-infested areas should
   wear them. Fire ants appear unable to sting through many commercially
   available socks. Cotton tights may be useful in protecting the lower
   extremities of children. Fire ants are not deterred from stinging by a
   wide variety of insect repellents and chemical substances.}},

Abstract = {{Formaldehyde activating enzyme (Fae) was first discovered in
   methylotrophic bacteria, where it is involved in the oxidation of
   methanol to CO2 and in formaldehyde detoxification. The 18 kDa protein
   catalyzes the condensation of formaldehyde with tetrahydromethanopterin
   (H4MPT) to methylene-H4MPT. We describe here that Fae is also present
   and functional in the methanogenic archaeon Methanosarcina barkeri. The
   faeA homologue in the genome of M. barkeri was heterologously expressed
   in Escherichia coli and the overproduced purified protein shown to
   actively catalyze the condensation reaction: apparent V-max = 13 U/mg
   protein (1 U = mu mol/min); apparent Km for H4MPT = 30 mu M; apparent Km
   for formaldehyde = 0.1 mM. By Western blot analysis the concentration of
   Fae in cell extracts of M. barkeri was determined to be in the order of
   0.1\% of the soluble cell proteins. Besides the faeA gene the genome of
   M. barkeri harbors a second gene, faeB-hpsB, which is shown to code for
   a 42 kDa protein with both Fae activity (3.6 U/mg) and
   hexulose-6-phosphate synthase (Hps) activity (4.4 U/mg). The results
   support the recent proposal that in methanogenic archaea Fae and Hps
   could have a function in ribose phosphate synthesis.}},

Abstract = {{This article asks a new question: what are the processes that maintain
   rivalries? The authors argue that rivalries are maintained through the
   failure of realist strategies and conflict management ones. They focus
   on stalemate outcomes as both a signal that militarized strategies for
   dealing with conflict have not succeeded and as reasons for the
   countries to continue the rivalry. They explore the process of rivalry
   maintenance, largely from the perspective of the punctuated equilibrium
   model of rivalries, and examine 1, 166 rivalries across the period from
   1816 to 1992. They contrast their approach with that of the ``repeated
   conflicts{''} literature, which only examines the impact of the previous
   dispute on recurring conflict. The authors find that the most recent
   conflict does matter, and the longer term history of the rivalry is more
   important. They also find that the impacts of various factors (e.g.,
   democracy) change over the course of the rivalry.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Chronology poorly predicts biological age (BA) or physiologic

   Materials And Methods: The first pilot study evaluated 130 ``healthy{''}
   volunteers, ages 70 to 95 years. A summary BA/PR index was developed,
   using measures of endurance, strength, flexibility, balance, cognition,
   depression, comorbidity, and exercise. The second study applied the
   BA/PR concept to prediction of death after a first elective coronary
   artery bypass graft, using a Veterans Administration database.
   Results: The BA/PR index was a better predictor of 3-year functional
   outcomes and death than was chronological age. In the coronary artery
   bypass graft Study, the inclusion of BA/PR variables significantly
   improved prediction of 6-month and long-term death for Veterans
   Administration patients.
   Conclusions: The usefulness of a biological age (BA/PR) approach in
   predicting outcomes in the elderly was supported. Needed research Should

Abstract = {{In this study, hard k-means and fuzzy c-means algorithms are utilized
   for the classification of fine grained soils in terms of shear strength
   and plasticity index parameters. In order to collect data, several
   laboratory tests are performed on 120 undisturbed soil samples, which
   are obtained from Antalya region. Additionally, for the evaluation of
   the generalization ability of clustering analysis, 20 fine grained soil
   samples collected from the other regions of Turkey are also classified
   using the same clustering algorithms. Fuzzy c-means algorithm exhibited
   better clustering performance over hard k-means classifier. As expected,
   clustering analysis produced worse outcomes for soils collected from
   different regions than those of obtained from a specific region. In
   addition to its precise classification ability, fuzzy c-means approach
   is also capable of handling the uncertainty existing in soil parameters.
   As a result, fuzzy c-means clustering can be successfully applied to
   classify regional fine grained soils on the basis of shear strength and
   plasticity index parameters. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE - individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) appear to
   be at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) due at least in
   part to an increased prevalence of risk factors. We evaluated lipid,
   lipoprotein, C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, and tissue
   plasminogen activator (tPA) levels at study entry in the largest
   multiethnic cohort of participants with IGT described, namely in the
   Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP).
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Measurements were performed at the
   baseline visit of 3,819 randomized participants of the DPP. Among 3,622
   participants who Were not taking lipid-lowering medicines,
   cardiovascular risk factors were analyzed in relation to demographic,
   anthropometric, and metabolic measures. Major determinants of risk
   factors were assessed in multivariate analysis.
   RESULTS - Over 40\% of participants had elevated triglyceride, LDL
   cholesterol, and CRP levels and reduced HDL cholesterol levels. Men had
   higher triglyceride and tPA and lower HDL cholesterol concentrations and
   smaller LDL particle size than women, whereas women had higher CRP and
   fibrinogen levels. African Americans had less dyslipidemia but higher
   fibrinogen levels, and Asian Americans had lower CRP and fibrinogen
   levels than Caucasians and Hispanics. The surrogate measure of insulin
   resistance (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance
   {[}HOMA-IR]) had the strongest association with HDL cholesterol,
   triglyceride, and tPA levels and LDL particle size. BMI had the greatest
   influence on CRP and fibrinogen levels. Using median splits of indexes
   of insulin resistance and insulin secretion (insulin-to-glucose ratio),
   participants with greater insulin resistance had a more adverse CVD
   risk-factor profile, whereas insulin secretion had little influence on
   risk factors.
   CONCLUSIONS - The pattern of CVD risk factors in participants with IGT
   in the DPP exhibits substantial heterogeneity and is significantly
   influenced by race, sex, and age, as well as by obesity, glucose, and
   insulin measures. The degree of insulin resistance, as reflected by
   HOMA-IR, showed the greatest association with the cardiovascular risk
   factors.}},

Abstract = {{Instrumenting programs with code to monitor runtime behavior is a common
   technique for profiling and debugging. In practice, instrumentation is
   either inserted manually by programmers, or automatically by specialized
   tools that monitor particular properties. We propose Program Trace Query
   Language (PTQL), a language based on relational queries over program
   traces, in which programmers can write expressive, declarative queries
   about program behavior. We also describe our compiler, PARIQLE. Given a
   PTQL query and a Java program, PARTIQLE instruments the program to
   execute the query on-line. We apply several PTQL queries to a set of
   benchmark programs, including the Apache Tomcat Web server. Our queries
   reveal significant performance bugs in the jack SpecJVM98 benchmark, in
   Tomcat, and in the IBM Java class library, as well as some correct
   though uncomfortably subtle code in the Xerces XML parser. We present
   performance measurements demonstrating that our prototype system has
   usable performance.}},

Abstract = {{Although gallstone disease is highly prevalent, cholelithiasis causing
   gallstone ileus is uncommon. Consideration has been given for
   nonoperative strategies to resolve obstruction due to the significant
   age and comorbidities afflicting this population. A 94-year-old man
   presented with a 5-day history of abdominal distension and tenderness.
   CT scan revealed multiple large gallstones within the gallbladder,
   pneumobilia, and two ectopic gallstones (antrum of the stomach and
   distal ileum). The patient was taken to the operating room where an
   enterolithotomy and gastrotomy was performed with removal of gallstones
   and subsequent relief of obstruction. During the postoperative course,
   the patient developed symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction and
   underwent gastrointestinal endoscopy for diagnosis and treatment. Two
   large gallstones, present in the duodenum, were retracted into the
   stomach using a Roth net but could not be retrieved beyond the upper
   esophageal sphincter. A holmium: yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Holmium: YAG)
   laser was used for fragmentation of the stones, with subsequent
   successful removal. This is the first documented successful use of the
   holmium: YAG laser for the treatment of recurrent gallstone ileus.
   Physicians should remember that in a small but important subgroup of
   patients, endoscopy accompanied by laser lithotripsy may prove
   beneficial.}},

Abstract = {{During helminthic infections, strong Th2 type-biased responses
   concomitant with impaired cell-proliferative responses to parasitic and
   unrelated antigens are major immunological hallmarks. Parasite glycan
   structures have been proposed to play a role in modulating these
   responses. To understand early events related to immune modulation
   during cestode infection, we have examined the role of intact glycans of
   antigens from Taenia crassiceps in the recruitment of innate cells.
   Soluble antigens from this cestode contained higher levels of
   carbohydrates than proteins. Intraperitoneal injection of the antigens
   rapidly recruited a cell population expressing F4/80(+)/Gr-1(+)surface
   markers, which adoptively suppressed naive T-cell proliferation in vitro
   in response to anti-CD3/CD28 MAb stimulation in a cell-contact dependent
   manner. Soluble antigens with altered glycans by treatment with sodium
   periodate significantly reduced the recruitment of F4/80(+)/Gr1(+)cells,
   concomitantly their suppressive activity was abrogated, indicating that
   glycans have a role in the early activation of these suppressor cells.
   Using C3H/HeJ and STAT6-KO mice, we found that expansion and suppressive
   activity of F4/80(+)Gr1(+)cells induced by T. crassiceps intact antigens
   was TLR4 and Th2-type cytokine independent. Together with previous
   studies on nematode and trematode parasites, our data support the
   hypothesis that glycans can be involved on a similar pathway in the
   immunoregulation by helminths.}},

Abstract = {{An element a of a complex Banach algebra with unit 1 and with standard
   conditions on the norm (parallel to ab parallel to <= parallel to a
   parallel to (.) parallel to b parallel to and parallel to 1 parallel to
   = 1) is said to be Hermitian if parallel to e(ita)parallel to = 1 for
   any real number t. An element is said to be decomposable if it admits a
   representation of the form a + ib in which a and b are Hermitian. The
   decomposable elements form a Banach Lie algebra (with respect to the
   commutator). The Hermitian components are determined uniquely, and hence
   this Lie algebra has the natural involution a + ib = x -> x{*} = a - ib.
   One can readily see that parallel to x{*}parallel to <= 2 parallel to x
   parallel to. Among other things, we prove that parallel to x{*}parallel
   to <= gamma parallel to x parallel to, where gamma < 2. In fact, the
   situation is treated in more detail: the original problem is included in
   a continuous family parametrized by the numerical radius of the element.
   Finding the exact value of the constant gamma is reduced to a
   variational problem in the theory of entire functions of exponential
   type. Approximately, gamma is equal to 1.92 +/- 0.04.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Nasogastric tube (NGT) decompression after abdominal surgery
   is still largely used to prevent nausea and vomiting. However,
   indications are based more on practice than on studies. Moreover,
   prolonged NGT decompression can lead to complications. In this
   prospective and randomized study, we evaluated the effects of early
   withdrawal of NGTs in patients undergoing surgery of the infrarenal
   aorta.
   Methods. Between October 2001 and May 2002, consecutive patients
   underwent scheduled infrarenal aortic operations. Patients were
   prospectively randomised into two groups: group 1, NGT maintenance until
   the passage of flatus; and group 2, NGT removal at the time of tracheal
   extubation. Preoperative and perioperative data were collected. The main
   end point was the occurrence of nausea and vomiting. Secondary end
   points were tolerance of NGT withdrawal and postoperative complications.
   Criteria were compared between groups by using Mann-Whitney or Fisher
   exact tests.
   Results. Forty-six patients underwent aortic operations. Six patients
   were subsequently excluded from the study. Of the 40 randomized
   subjects, 20 patients were included in each group. Preoperative and
   intraoperative data were similar in both groups. There was no
   statistical difference between groups regarding nausea and vomiting. In
   group 1, the occurrence of respiratory complications was more frequent
   compared with group 2 (5 vs 0 complications; P =.023). There was no
   significant difference in intensive care unit stay, but the hospital
   stay was shorter in group 2 (mean, 9 +/- 3 days vs 15 +/- 9 days; P
   =.016). There were no differences in other adverse events.
   Conclusions. This study does not support a significant effect of early
   removal of NGTs on nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing open
   repair of the infrarenal aorta. However, these findings suggest that NGT
   maintenance increases the risk of respiratory complications and the
   length of hospital stay.}},

Title = {{Improving seizure control in dogs with refractory epilepsy using
   gabapentin as an adjunctive agent}},
Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN VETERINARY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{83}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{602-608}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objective. To assess whether there is a change in seizure activity in
   dogs with refractory epilepsy that are receiving appropriate doses of
   phenobarbitone and/or potassium bromide, when gabapentin is added to the
   therapeutic regimen.
   Design. A prospective study of 17 dogs with a refractory seizure
   disorder, 16 of which have idiopathic epilepsy.
   Procedure. Patients were stabilised using phenobarbitone and/or
   potassium bromide to produce tolerable therapeutic serum concentrations
   and dosed additionally with gabapentin at 35 to 50 mg/kg/d (divided
   twice or three times daily) for 4 months. Owners recorded seizure
   activity and side effects during this period in a standardised diary.
   Patients underwent monthly physical examinations and venepuncture to
   assess selected serum biochemical analytes, as well as phenobarbitone
   and bromide concentrations. Patients were further monitored for
   long-term response to adjunctive gabapentin therapy.
   Results. There was no significant decrease in the number of seizures
   over the study period for the entire cohort, however three dogs stopped
   seizuring completely. There was a significant increase in the number of
   patients who showed an increase in the interictal period (P > 0.001).
   Serum alkaline phosphatase activity and triglyceride concentrations were
   elevated at baseline. There were no significant changes in biochemical
   analytes during the course of the study period. Side effects observed
   initially on addition of gabapentin included sedation and hind limb
   ataxia. The former resolved spontaneously after a few days; the latter
   after a slight reduction in bromide dose. Long-term, a further two
   patients became seizure free and ten patients remained on gabapentin
   indefinitely. No long-term side effects have become apparent.
   Conclusion. Addition of gabapentin to phenobarbitone and/or potassium
   bromide increased the interictal period and shortened the post-seizure
   recovery in some canine epileptics. In some dogs, seizures were
   prevented completely, while in others there was an increase in
   interictal period. The short-half life of gabapentin has advantages for
   seizure control, however its present high cost may prohibit therapy in
   large dogs.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we describe architecture and implementation of a
   Probabilistic Agent-Based Intrusion Detection (PAID) system. The PAID
   system has a cooperative agent architecture. Autonomous agents can
   perform specific intrusion detection tasks (e.g., identify IP-spoofing
   attacks) and also collaborate with other agents. The main contributions
   of our work are the following: our model allows agents to share their
   beliefs, i.e., the probability distribution of an event occurrence.
   Agents are capable to perform soft-evidential update, thus providing a
   continuous scale for intrusion detection. We propose methods for
   modelling errors and resolving conflicts among beliefs. Finally, we have
   implemented a proof-of-concept prototype of PAID. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Selective agonists of beta(3)-adrenergic receptors (Adrb3) exhibit
   potent anti-diabetes properties in rodent models when given chronically,
   yet the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. A salient feature of
   chronic Adrb3 activation is pronounced remodeling of white adipose
   tissue (WAT), which includes mitochondrial biogenesis and elevation of
   metabolic rate. To gain insights into potential mechanisms underlying
   WAT remodeling, the time course of remodeling induced by the Adrb3
   agonist CL-316,243 (CL) was analyzed using histological, physiological,
   and global gene profiling approaches. The results indicate that
   continuous CL treatment induced a transient proinflammatory response
   that was followed by cellular proliferation among stromal cells and
   multilocular adipoctyes. CL treatment strongly fragmented the central
   lipid storage droplet of mature adipocytes and induced mitochondrial
   biogenesis within these cells. Mitochondrial biogenesis was correlated
   with the upregulation of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and
   mitochondrial electron transport activity. The elevated catabolic
   activity of WAT was temporally correlated with upregulation of
   peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha and its target genes,
   suggesting involvement of this transcription factor in coordinating the
   gene program that elevates WAT catabolic activity.}},

Abstract = {{While considerable work has been reported in the literature on the
   corrosion behavior and products of direct reduced iron and sponge iron,
   very little has been published on hot briquetted iron (HBI). The present
   article reports the kinetics and mechanism of HBI corrosion. As
   corrosion is an electrochemical process, measurements using
   electrochemical techniques have been made and these are compared to data
   gained by measuring mass changes in the briquettes over time. Similar
   trends were seen in data from both techniques, and the corrosion extent
   predicted by electrochemical measurements in saline solution was very
   close to the mass gain result obtained. Kinetic analysis of the data
   from mass gain over time trials was conducted. The activation energy for
   corrosion at temperatures between 25 degrees C and 80 degrees C has been
   calculated. The values of activation energy obtained indicate that
   corrosion was predominantly controlled by diffusion of oxygen in the
   liquid state. The internal structure of the briquettes was observed by
   microscopy both before and after corrosion in distilled water.}},

Abstract = {{Previously, we have demonstrated both analytically and experimentally
   subwavelength imaging using a negative-refractive-index lens made of a
   periodically L, C loaded transmission line (TL) network. This loaded

   Here, we consider the limitations on subwavelength imaging imposed by
   impedance mismatches and the component losses of a practical dual TL
   lens. Simple expressions for estimating the resolving capability of a
   dual TL lens are given. It is found that the resolution enhancement of
   the dual lens is proportional to the quality factor of the series
   loading capacitors divided by the electrical thickness of the lens. The
   effective material parameters of the dual TL lens are also derived so
   that these expressions can be directly related to those of previous
   studies considering uniform and isotropic left-handed lenses. Finally,
   the resolving capability of an experimental lens that achieves
   subwavelength imaging is theoretically predicted. These theoretical
   predictions are then directly compared to previously reported
   experimental results.}},

Title = {{Public understanding of food risks in four European countries: a

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Background: In the wake of the ` bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( BSE)
   crisis' there was renewed interest in how those responsible for public
   health could take account of public views, both to ` democratize' policy
   making and to increase the likelihood of information about health risks
   resonating with public concerns. This study explored how members of the
   public in four European countries ( Finland, Germany, Italy and the UK)
   understood food risks in general, and risks arising from BSE in
   particular. The aims were to identify the sources of knowledge used and
   trusted by the public and to explore how public views could be accessed
   for public health information policy.
   Methods: Thirty- six focus group interviews were held using a common
   protocol across the four countries, including people from four lifecycle
   stages.
   Results: The study demonstrated the utility of using focus groups as a
   relatively efficient method for accessing public views, and the
   feasibility of cross- national qualitative research on public views. We
   found that public views of food risks are neither irrational nor naive,
   but that they do need to be interpreted in the context of everyday food
   purchasing decisions, in which particular food risks are unlikely to
   have the same salience as they do for experts.
   Conclusions: Focus groups are a feasible method for accessing public
   knowledge on public health risks to inform information strategies.}},

Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Single dose activated charcoal (SDAC) may be an effective
   method of gastric decontamination when administered to patients within
   an hour of drug overdose. However, few patients who may benefit from
   this treatment attend an emergency department within this timeframe. The
   authors sought to determine the current attitudes of ambulance NHS
   trusts to recent recommendations that the administration of SDAC should
   be considered as a prehospital therapy.
   Methods: A postal questionnaire was used to determine the current level
   of use of prehospital activated charcoal by ambulance NHS trusts, the
   incidence of associated complications, and barriers preventing the
   routine use of prehospital SDAC.
   Results: A completed questionnaire was returned by 36 of the 39
   ambulance NHS trusts in the UK ( response rate 92\%). Currently none of
   the trusts that responded to the questionnaire provides prehospital SDAC
   as an intervention. The most common barriers to the provision of
   prehospital SDAC are the current lack of evidence in the medical
   literature proving it is effective in improving patient outcome and the
   lack of a recognised protocol for its administration. Other issues
   included concerns regarding potential complications, ambulance
   turnaround times, lack of availability of SDAC, and lack of funding.
   Conclusions: A lack of published evidence proving efficacy remains the
   most important factor in preventing the routine administration of SDAC
   to appropriate patients in the prehospital environment. Further research
   in this setting is required to determine the usefulness of this therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Because of their different origins, cosmic rays can be subdivided into
   galactic cosmic rays and solar/stellar cosmic rays. The flux of cosmic
   rays to planetary surfaces is mainly determined by two planetary
   parameters: the atmospheric density and the strength of the internal
   magnetic moment. If a planet exhibits an extended magnetosphere, its
   surface will be protected from high-energy cosmic ray particles. We show
   that close-in extrasolar planets in the habitable zone of M stars are
   synchronously rotating with their host star because of the tidal
   interaction. For gravitationally locked planets the rotation period is
   equal to the orbital period, which is much longer than the rotation
   period expected for planets not subject to tidal locking. This results'
   in a relatively small magnetic moment. We found that an Earth-like
   extra-solar planet, tidally locked in an orbit of 0.2 AU around an M
   star of 0.5 solar masses, has a rotation rate of 2\% of that of the
   Earth. This results in a magnetic moment of less than 15\% of the
   Earth's current magnetic moment. Therefore, close-in extrasolar planets
   seem not to be protected by extended Earth-like magnetospheres, and
   cosmic rays can reach almost the whole surface area of the upper
   atmosphere. Primary cosmic ray particles that interact with the
   atmosphere generate secondary energetic particles, a so-called cosmic
   ray shower. Some of the secondary particles can reach the surface of
   terrestrial planets when the surface pressure of the atmosphere is on
   the order of 1 bar or less. We propose that, depending on atmospheric
   pressure, biological systems on the surface of Earth-like extrasolar
   planets at close-in orbital distances can be strongly influenced,by
   secondary cosmic rays.}},

Abstract = {{We consider, using theory and associated synthetic seismograms, the
   seismic response of a site comprising a horizontal, homogeneous, soft
   viscoelastic layer of infinite lateral extent overlying, and in welded
   contact with, a homogeneous, hard elastic substratum of half-infinite
   radial extent. We show that for shear-horizontal motion: (1) coupling to
   Love modes is all the weaker the deeper the source (modelled as a line,
   assumed to lie in the substratum) is from the lower boundary of the soft
   layer, (2) for a line source close to the lower boundary of the soft
   layer, the ground response is characterized by possible beating
   phenomena, and is of significantly longer duration than for excitation
   by cylindrical waves radiated by deep sources. Numerical applications of
   the theory show, for instance, that a line source, located 40 m below
   the lower boundary of a 60-m-thick soft layer in a hypothetical
   Mexico-City-like site, radiating a SH pulse of 4 s duration, produces
   substantial ground motion during 200 s, with marked beating, at an

Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to examine relationships among lactational
   status, naturalistic stress mood, and levels of serum cortisol and
   prolactin and plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Eighty-four
   exclusively breastfeeding, 99 exclusively formula-feeding, and 33
   nonpostpartum healthy control women were studied. The postpartum mothers
   were studied cross-sectionally once between 4 and 6 weeks after the
   birth. Stress was measured using the Perceived Stress Scale, the
   Tennessee Postpartum Stress Scale, and the Inventory of Small Life
   Events. Mood was measured using the Profile of Mood States. Serum
   prolactin, plasma ACTH, and serum cortisol levels were measured by
   commercial ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) kits. Results
   indicate that breastfeeding mothers had more positive moods, reported
   more positive events, and perceived less stress than formula-feeders.
   Reports of stressful life events were generally equivalent in the two
   groups. Serum prolactin was inversely related to stress and mood in
   formula-feeders. When breast and formula-feeders were compared to
   controls, they had higher serum cortisol, lower stress, and lower
   anxiety. Breastfeeders had lower perceived stress than controls.
   Breastfeeders had lower depression and anger and more positive life
   events reported than formula-feeders. However, there were few
   correlations among stress, mood, and the hormones in postpartum mothers,
   and those only informula-feeders, whereas strong relationships were
   found between serum ACTH and a number of stress and mood variables in
   controls. Postpartum mothers reported a range of stress and negative
   moods at 4 to 6 weeks, and in formula-feeders, serum prolactin was
   related to some of the stress and mood variables. Breastfeeding appears
   to be somewhat protective of negative moods and stress.}},

Abstract = {{Different washing and homogeneisation solutions are hereby analysed by
   comparing the evolution of fonctional indicators during the preservation
   of washed aphaeresis platelet concentrate: physiological pH 4.5 and 6
   solutions, battered physiological pH 6.8 glucose solution, and two
   physiological pH 7 citrate solutions with acetate. Prior acidification
   of platelet concentrates proved to be essential. Two whashings with
   manual or automated technique, guarantee residual proteins at a level of
   less than 0.5 g. Solutions T-Sol Baxter or SSP Macopharma allow us to
   obtain a product that meet the PSL specifications. Routine since June
   2004, washings are down with a physiological pH 6 solution, then
   homogeneised with T-Sol solution. Platelet recovery, swirling
   phenomenon, lack of agrgegates, pH maintenance, low increase in the
   platelet average volume and maintenance of intra-cell potassium level,
   suggest that platelet entirety is preserved beyond the product's expiry
   date. The platelet transfusion yield of these products is satisfactory.

Abstract = {{Purpose: To develop a valid treatment strategy for recurrent high-grade
   gliomas using stereotactic hypofractionated reirradiation based on
   biologic imaging and temozolomide.
   Patients and Methods: The trial included a total of 44 patients with
   recurrent high-grade gliomas (1 patient with anaplastic
   oligodendroglioma, 8 with anaplastic astrocytoma, 33 with glioblastoma
   multiforme, and 2 with gliosarcoma) after previous surgery and
   postoperative conventional radiotherapy +/- chemotherapy. For
   fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SFRT) treatment planning, the
   gross tumor volume was defined by C-11-methionine positron emission
   tomography (MET-PET) or 123 I-a-methyl-tyrosine (IMT) single-photon
   computed emission tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT)/magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) fusion in 82\% of the patients and by
   CT/T1+gadolinium-MRI image fusion in 18\% of the patients. Six fractions
   of 5 Gy were administered in 6 days. In 29 of 44 patients (66\%),
   chemotherapy with temozolomide (200 mg/m(2) body surface/day) was given
   in one to two cycles before and four to five cycles after SFRT. The
   patients were evaluated in follow-up by clinical investigators and MRI
   or CT every 3 months after SFRT until death. In cases suspicious for
   radiation necrosis, a MET-PET or IMT-SPECT investigation was performed.
   Results: The median survival time in the whole group was 8 months.
   Treatment planning based on PET(SPECT)/CT/MRI imaging was associated
   with improved survival in comparison to treatment planning using CT/MRI
   alone: median survival time 9 months vs. 5 months (p = 0.03, log-rank),
   Median survival time were 11 months for patients who received SFRT based
   on biologic imaging plus temozolomide and significantly lower, 6 months
   for patients treated with SFRT without biologic imaging, without
   temozolomide or without both (p = 0.008, log rank). The most important
   prognostic factor in univariate analysis was a long interval between
   initial diagnosis and recurrence (p = 0.0002, log-rank). In the
   multivariate model, time interval to retreatment (p = 0.006) and
   temozolomide (p = 0.04) remained statistically significant. No acute
   neurologic toxicity Grade 3 or higher and no Grade 4 hematologic
   toxicity was observed.
   Conclusion: This is the first study of biologic imaging optimized SFRT
   plus temozolomide in recurrent high-grade gliomas. It demonstrates the
   feasibility and safety of this approach. The most striking result of the
   trial is the statistically significant longer survival time in the
   univariate analysis for patients reirradiated using MET-PET or
   IMT-SPECT/CT/MRI image fusion in the treatment planning, in comparison
   to patients treated based on MRI/CT alone. Multivariate analysis
   confirmed a significant survival benefit from multimodal treatment
   (i.e., addition of temozolomide), despite the limited number of
   patients. Whether treatment planning with SPECT/PET independently
   influences survival has to be studied in a larger series of patients.

Abstract = {{Fibroblast growth factors (Fgfs) have long been implicated in regulating
   vertebrate skeletal muscle differentiation, but their precise role(s) in
   vivo remain unclear. Here, we show that Fgf8 signalling in the somite is
   required for myod expression and terminal differentiation of a subset of
   fast muscle cells in the zebrafish lateral somite. In the absence of
   Fgf8, lateral somite cells transiently express myf5 but fail to make
   muscle and remain in a dermomyotome-like state characterised by pax3 and
   meox expression. Slow muscle fibres form and commence normal migration
   in the absence of Fgf8, but fail to traverse the expanded
   undifferentiated lateral somite. The Fgf8-independent residual
   population of medial fast muscle fibres is not Hedgehog dependent.
   However, Fgf8-independent medial fast muscle precursors are lacking in
   floatinghead mutants, suggesting that they require another ventral
   midline-derived signal. We conclude that Fgf8 drives terminal
   differentiation of a specific population of lateral muscle precursor
   cells within the early somite.}},

Abstract = {{Embryonic stem (ES) cell pluripotency and differentiation are controlled
   by a network of transcription factors and signaling molecules.
   Transcription factors such as Oct4 and Nanog are required for
   self-renewal and maintain the undifferentiated state of ES cells.
   Decreases in the expression of these factors indicate the initiation of
   differentiation of ES cells. Inactivation of the gene encoding the
   orphan nuclear receptor GCNF showed that it plays an important role in
   the repression of Oct4 expression in somatic cells during early
   embryonic development. GCNF(-/-) ES cells were isolated to study the
   function of GCNF in the down-regulation of pluripotency genes during
   differentiation. Loss of repression of ES cell marker genes Oct4, Nanog,
   Sox2, FGF4, and Stella was observed upon treatment of GCNF(-/-) ES cells
   with retinoic acid. The loss of repression of pluripotency genes is
   either a direct or indirect consequence of loss of GCNF. Both the Oct4
   and Nanog genes are direct targets of GCNF repression during ES cell
   differentiation and early mouse embryonic development. In contrast Sox2
   and FGF4 are indirectly regulated by GCNF through Oct4. These findings
   establish a central role for GCNF in the repression of pluripotency gene
   expression during retinoic acid-induced ES cell differentiation.}},

Abstract = {{Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) prevents in vitro gallbladder (GB) muscle
   damage caused by acute cholecystitis and reduces risk:! of biliary pain
   and complications in gallstone (GS) patients. These effects could be
   partially explained by the improved GB bile turnover.
   Objectives: To assess the effect of short-term UDCA treatment on GB
   motility and bile turnover.
   Methods: Ultrasonographic (US) assessment of GB volumes was performed :
   in 16. GS patients, in the postprandial phase, for 90 min with a time
   sampling of 1 min, before and after 30 days of UDCA (10 mg kg(-1)
   die(-1)) or placebo, randomly assigned. US data were analysed: with
   statistical tools and with computer fluido-dynamic (CFD) software
   Fluent(TM) to simulate GB bile flow.
   Results: After therapy, fasting volume (FV) increased from 21.6 +/- 9 to
   28.2 +/- 12 mL (p < 0.001) while the ejection fraction (EF) remained
   unchanged (44.5 +/- 17\% vs 45.1 +/- 20\%; p: ns). Volumes before an
   after treatment were poorly correlated (0.02 < r < 0.35), unlike those
   in placebo patients (r > 0.6). The average GB volume was increased in 7
   out of 10 patients following UDCA (range 7-67\%). CFD analysis supports
   the finding of improved bile flow after treatment.
   Conclusions: Unlike results of conventional US parameters of GB
   motility, CFD analysis shows that UDCA improves GB bile turnover in GS
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study was undertaken to evaluate the topographic
   distribution of precancerous intraepithelial lesions on the cervix.
   Study design: We studied the distribution of cervical biopsies and
   location of acetowhite lesions as determined by cervigrams among women
   who underwent a colposcopic examination and biopsy during the ASCUS-LSIL
   Triage Study (ALTS).
   Results: More biopsies were taken in the 12 o'clock (41:4\%) and 6
   o'clock (28.4\%) quadrants than in 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock quadrant
   (15.8\% and 14.5\%, respectively) (P<.001). The proportion of abnormal
   histology per biopsy, and the grade of neoplasia, did not vary
   significantly by position. Cervigrams demonstrated visible
   intraepithelial lesions and acetowhitening more common on the anterior
   and posterior quadrants of the cervix.
   Conclusion: More cervical intraepithelial neoplasia might develop at the
   anterior and posterior lips of the cervix. However, the evidence is weak
   and confounded by a tendency of the anterior and posterior quadrants to
   be acetowhite even in the absence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.

Abstract = {{In the 1980s it became increasingly clear that the European Community
   market was still segmented by national borders because of non-tariff
   barriers to trade. A major objective of the Single Market Program in
   1992 was to remove these barriers, thereby enforcing intra-union
   competition. In this paper, a panel of Swedish firm-level data is used
   to evaluate whether domestic market power has been curtailed as a
   consequence of the SMP and of the Swedish membership in the European
   Union in 1995. Evidence of increased competition emerges, as price-cost
   margins have declined in industries with high non-tariff barriers prior
   to 1992.}},

   that there existed efficient Forster energy transfer from Mn2+ to
   PNIPAAm due to the emission spectra of Mn2+ overlapping the excitation
   spectra of PNIPAAm and that the emission peak of Mn2+ at 561 nm
   disappeared in Mn2+ -PNIPAAm complex. Therefore the fluorescence

Abstract = {{Tyrosine kinases are used as important biomarkers in many tumor types.
   Preclinical and clinical anti-tumor studies have shown that broadly
   acting tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be more useful than specific
   inhibitors, since the former might overcome redundancies and crosstalk
   in tumor cell growth signaling pathways. Here, we aim to identify a
   novel potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Computer modeling of the
   pyrido-pyrimidine class compound,
   TKI-28(6-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-8-methyl-2-phenylamino-8H-pyrido{[}2,3-d]p
   yrimidine7-one), predicted that the compound would dock well in the ATP
   pocket of the ErbB-2 tyrosine kinase, yielding a high binding affinity
   for ErbB receptors. Biochemical studies revealed that TKI-28 potently
   inhibited the activities of tyrosine kinases such as ErbB-2, EGFR, KDR,
   PDGFR b,c-kit and c-Src, but had little effect on Flt-1 in cell-free
   system. TKI-28 also efficiently blocked autophosphorylation of the
   listed receptor tyrosine kinases, and subsequently downregulated
   phosphorylation of many downstream signaling proteins at the cellular
   level. TKI-28 exhibited a more potent anti-proliferative activity
   against EGF- and neuregulin-stimulated SK-OV-3 cells versus
   serum-stimulated cells, accompanied by apparent induction of apoptosis.
   Finally, TKI-28 was found to possess anti-angiogenic effects,
   characterized by inhibition of cell proliferation driven by EGF, VEGF
   and PDGF, as well as decreased cell migration and tube formation in
   HMECs. These results collectively highlight the pharmacological
   characteristics of TKI-28 as a broad-spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor,
   suggesting that it has great potential as an anti-cancer and
   anti-angiogenesis agent.}},

Abstract = {{``Chasing the dragon{''} refers to the inhalation of heroin pyrolysate
   vapors produced when the freebase form of heroin is heated. Inhalation
   of these vapors can result in a rare toxic spongiform
   leukoencephalopathy. The patients may progress through 3 defined
   clinical stages, with one-quarter reaching the terminal stage, which
   invariably leads to death. Imaging and, in particular, magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrates white matter findings that are felt
   to be specific for this entity and essential in its early diagnosis. We
   present the typical imaging findings in a pictorial essay format, using
   images taken from 9 patients who presented within an 18-month period at
   UBC-affiliated hospitals. These findings include low computed tomography
   (CT) attenuation and high T2 MRI signal most commonly in the posterior
   cerebral and cerebellar white matter, cerebellar peduncles, splenium of
   the corpus callosum, and posterior limb of the internal capsules. In
   addition, there is often selective, symmetric involvement of the
   corticospinal tract, the medial lemniscus, and the tractus solitarius.
   We also present the variable diffusion-weighted imaging and apparent
   diffusion coefficient findings from 4 of our patients, which to our
   knowledge, have not been described in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{In plants, microsatellites and their flanking DNA are rarely conserved
   across a whole genus, let alone other genera in the same family.
   Therefore, the possibility of using microsatellite primers developed for
   a species across a large number of plant species in the same genus is
   often limited. Remarkably, dinucleotide nuclear microsatellites
   developed for Clusia minor and for Clusia nemorosa amplified homologous
   microsatellites in species across the whole genus Clusia. In this
   present study, we report on the DNA sequence variation across the genus
   of 3 microsatellite loci with varying levels of variation. Compared over
   the species, there was a correlation between the lengths of the
   microsatellite loci. Interrupts occurred multiple times and did not seem
   to lead to the death of the microsatellite. These highly conserved
   markers will be useful for studying the variable reproductive systems in
   the genus Clusia.}},

Abstract = {{Field studies in citrus were conducted to compare the following as
   attractants for the Caribbean fruit fly, Anastrepha suspensa (Loew):
   torula yeast-borax; propylene glycol (10\%); a two-component lure
   consisting of ammonium acetate and putrescine; a two-component lure
   consisting of ammonium bicarbonate and putrescine; and a three-component
   lure consisting of ammonium bicarbonate, methylamine hydrochloride, and
   putrescine. Various combinations of these attractants in glass McPhail,
   plastic McPhail-type (Multi-Lure), and sticky panel traps were
   investigated in two replicated studies. In one study on wild flies, the
   most effective and least complex trap-lure combination tested was the
   Multi-Lure with propylene glycol baited with ammonium acetate and
   putrescine. This trap-lure combination captured significantly more
   female and male flies than the standard glass McPhail baited with torula
   yeast-borax in water. All of the trap-lure combinations were female
   biased, with an overall average of 80.8\% (SEM 1.4) flies captured being
   female. A second study on laboratory-reared, irradiated flies indicated
   no significant differences among these trap-lure combinations with
   respect to number of flies recaptured, although rankings based on mean
   number of flies recovered per trap per day supported results of the
   first study. The percentage of flies recaptured that were female
   (83.0\%, SEM 0.9) was statistically the same as in the first study.
   Weekly percentage recovery of flies during the second study was low,
   possibly due to our fly release strategy. Future release/recovery
   studies with laboratory-reared flies would benefit from some basic
   research on release strategies by using different trap densities and on
   relating recapture rates of laboratory-reared flies (nonsterile and
   sterile) to capture rates of wild flies.}},

Abstract = {{The physiological consequences of trichloroethylene (TCE) transformation
   by three butane oxidizers were examined. Pseudomonas butanovora,
   Mycobacterium vaccae, and Nocardioides sp. CF8 utilize distinctly
   different butane monooxygenases (BMOs) to initiate degradation of the
   recalcitrant TCE molecule. Although the primary toxic event resulting
   from TCE cometabolism by these three strains was loss of BMO activity,
   species differences were observed. P. butanovora and Nocardioides sp.
   CF8 maintained only 4\% residual BMO activity following exposure to 165
   mu M TCE for 90 min and 180 min, respectively. In contrast, M. vaccae
   maintained 34\% residual activity even after exposure to 165 mu M TCE
   for 300 min. Culture viability was reduced 83\% in P. butanovora, but
   was unaffected in the other two species. Transformation of 530 nmol of
   TCE by P. butanovora (1.0 mg total protein) did not affect the viability
   of BMO-deficient P. butanovora cells, whereas transformation of 482 nmol
   of TCE by toluene-grown Burkholderia cepacia G4 caused 87\% of
   BMO-deficient P. butanovora cells to lose viability. Together, these
   results contrast with those previously reported for other bacteria
   carrying out TCE cometabolism and demonstrate the range of cellular
   toxicities associated with TCE cometabolism.}},

   achieved are 6.0 and 3.7 GHz and the band-stop widths are 2.8 and 2.0

Abstract = {{Mesiodistal and buccolingual crown diameters of all teeth recorded in 72
   major human population groups and seven geographic groups were analyzed.
   The results obtained are fivefold. First, the largest teeth are found
   among Australians, followed by Melanesians, Micronesians, sub-Saharan
   Africans, and Native Americans. Philippine Negritos, Jomon/Ainu, and
   Western Eurasians have small teeth, while East/Southeast Asians and
   Polynesians are intermediate in overall tooth size. Second, in terms of
   odontometric shape factors, world extremes are Europeans, aboriginal New
   World populations, and to a lesser extent, Australians. Third,
   East/Southeast Asians share similar dental features with sub-Saharan
   Africans, and fall in the center of the phenetic space occupied by a
   wide array of samples. Fourth, the patterning of dental variation among
   major geographic populations is more or less consistent with those
   obtained from genetic and craniometric data. Fifth, once differences in
   population size between sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, South/West Asia,
   Australia, and Far East, and genetic drift are taken into consideration,
   the pattern of sub-Saharan African distinctiveness becomes more or less
   comparable to that based on genetic and craniometric data. As such,
   worldwide patterning of odontometric variation provides an additional
   avenue in the ongoing investigation of the origin(s) of anatomically
   modern humans.}},

Abstract = {{Treatment with third-generation chemotherapy agents improves survival
   and quality of life of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
   Despite these favorable outcomes, most patients receiving front-line
   therapy experience disease progression. The availability of many new
   novel agents with activity in NSCLC has prompted investigators to
   explore second-line chemotherapy options. For many years, docetaxel was
   the only approved agent for the second-Line treatment of NSCLC. More
   recently, the multi-targeted antifolate pemetrexed has demonstrated
   activity in patients previously treated with chemotherapy with locally
   advanced or metastatic NSCLC. The findings of a phase III trial
   comparing pemetrexed to docetaxel Led to the regulatory approval of
   pemetrexed as monotherapy for the second-line treatment of NSCLC.
   Several other novel therapies, including molecular targeting agents such
   as erlotinib, are under development in clinical trials in patients with
   NSCLC. One of these trials has subsequently led to the approval of
   erlotinib as second- or third-line therapy in advanced NSCLC. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{It is shown that the drift waves can become unstable due to the shear
   flow produced by externally applied electric field. The modified
   Rayleigh instability condition is obtained which is applicable to both
   electron-ion and electron-positron-ion plasmas. It is proposed that the
   shear flow driven drift waves can be responsible for large amplitude
   electrostatic fluctuations in tokamak edges. In the nonlinear regime the
   stationary structures may appear in electron-positron-ion plasmas as
   well as electron-ion plasmas. A particular form of the shear flow can
   give rise to counter-rotating dipole vortices and vortex chains. The
   speed and amplitude of the structures are affected by the presence of
   positrons in the electron ion plasma. The relevance of this
   investigation to laboratory and astrophysical plasmas is pointed out.

Abstract = {{Schenkerian analysis is a problematic tool for the analysis of early
   modernist music, not least because its deep-level theoretical and
   hermeneutic dependence on the Beethovenian heroic style is at risk of
   predefining the outline of a hermeneutics of other music. By bringing
   the Ursatz into contact with Martin Heidegger's concept of the
   Augenblick, it becomes possible to sever this restrictive hermeneutic
   link and also to open up a radically new possibility for background
   structures in late tonal music.
   Elgar's First Symphony presents two considerable challenges to an
   orthodox Schenkerian reading. First, it is a prolongation of two
   strongly outlined tonalities - one immuring, the other immured - and
   second, its Kopfton remains static at the end of movements and does not
   descend structurally until the finale, thus prolonging a single Ursatz
   over an entire symphony. By aligning itself with Heidegger's analysis of
   the nature of human Being, a Heideggerian-Schenkerian analysis of the
   work illuminates Elgar's `play' with the Beethovenian symphonic
   tradition, and demonstrates how he successfully manipulates his gigantic
   early modernist tonal structure.}},

Journal = {{PATHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{Background: A survey of pathology reporting of breast cancer in Western
   Australia in 1989 highlighted the need for improvement. The current
   study documents (1) changes in pathology reporting from 1989 to 1999 and
   (2) changes in patterns of histopathological prognostic indicators for
   breast cancer following introduction of mammographic screening in 1989.
   Methods: Data concerning all breast cancer cases reported in Western
   Australia in 1989, 1994 and 1999 were retrieved using the State Cancer
   Registry, Hospital Morbidity data system, and pathology laboratory
   records.
   Results: Pathology reports improved in quality during the decade
   surveyed. For invasive carcinoma, tumour size was not recorded in 1.2\%
   of pathology reports in 1999 compared with 16.1\% in 1989 (rho<0.001).
   Corresponding figures for other prognostic factors were: tumour grade
   3.3\% and 51.6\% (rho<0.001), tumour type 0.2\% and 4.1\% (rho<0.001),
   vascular invasion 3.7\% and 70.9\% (rho<0.001), and lymph node status
   1.9\% and 4.5\% (rho=0.023). In 1999, 5.9\% of reports were not in a
   synoptic/checklist format, whereas all reports were descriptive in 1989
   (rho<0.001). For the population as a whole, the proportion of invasive
   carcinomas <1 cm was 20.9\% in 1999 compared with 14.5\% in 1989
   (rho<0.001); for tumours <2 cm the corresponding figures were 65.4\% and
   59.7\% (rho=0.013). In 1999, 30.5\% of tumours were histologically
   well-differentiated compared with 10.6\% in 1989 (rho<0.001), and 61.7\%
   were lymph node negative in 1999 compared with 57.1\% in 1989
   (rho=0.006). Pure ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) constituted 10.9\% and
   7.9\% of total cases of breast carcinoma in 1999 and 1989, respectively
   (rho=0.01).
   Conclusions: Quality of pathology reporting improved markedly over the
   period, in parallel with adoption of stanclardised synoptic pathology
   reports. By 1999, recording of important prognostic information was
   almost complete. Frequency of favourable prognostic factors generally
   increased over time, reflecting expected effects of mammographic
   screening.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose. The authors conducted a comparison of anterior chamber depth
   (ACD) measurement by 3 devices of EchoScan, Orbscan II, and IOLMaster to
   assess the validity of the latter 2 and its reliability with Orbscan II.
   Methods. Forty-four myopic patients, 56.8\% female, were enrolled in
   this prospective study. In all 88 eyes, the ACD was first measured with
   Orbscan II, followed by IOLMaster and EchoScan U3300, both under
   cycloplegia. The mean (+/- standard deviation) age and spherical
   equivalent were 30.2 +/- 8.5 years and -4.98 +/- 2.67 D, respectively.
   The difference between ACD measurements by these 3 devices was analyzed
   using the repeated-measures analysis of variance. Agreement between each
   pair of devices was assessed by computing the 95\% limits of agreement
   (LoA). Orbscan II reliability was also evaluated by using the 95\% LoA
   between 2 consecutive measurements. P value adjustments for multiple
   comparisons were performed using the Bonferroni method. Results. There
   was a statistically significant difference between measurements made
   with the 3 devices (p < 0.001). The mean difference between Orbscan II
   and Echoscan ACD measurements was -0.03 +/- 0.12 mm, with the 95\% LoA
   from -0.25 to +0.20 mm, and between IOLMaster and Echoscan measurements,
   it was +0.09 +/- 0.14 mm with the 95\% LoA from -0.18 to +036 mm. On
   average, Orbscan II readings were lower and those of IOLMaster were
   higher than Echoscan readings. Both Orbscan II and IOLMaster agreed with
   Echoscan in measuring ACD. The 2 readings by Orbscan II had a 95\% LoA
   of -0.05 and +0.07 mm that shows good reliability. Conclusion. ACD
   measurement differences with the 3 studied devices proved to be
   statistically significant; however, these minor differences may be
   clinically negligible depending on the use of the measurement. As an
   advantage, both Orbscan II and IOLMaster are noncontact, and with their
   ACD measurements being valid, they may be considered suitable devices
   for this purpose. in addition, Orbscan II produces highly repeatable ACD
   measurements.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: The purpose of this prospective study was to determine the
   outcome of postprocedural cerebral diffusion-weighted (DW) MR lesions
   after carotid artery stent placement (CAS) and the incidence of new
   cerebral MR lesions 6 months after the procedure.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: DW and T2-weighted MR imaging of the brain and
   neurologic examinations were performed in 105 patients before and 24
   hours and 6 months after CAS. In addition, a selective control
   angiography of the treated artery was performed after 6 months.
   RESULTS: In 22 (21\%) of 105 patients, DW MR images 24 hours after CAS
   showed 64 new neurologically silent lesions; 2 (3.1\%) of these 64
   lesions were also visible in T2-weighted MR images. The latter ones were
   still visible after 6 months. In the remaining 62 lesions, there were no
   abnormalities visible in DW and T2-weighted imaging at follow-up. In 2
   (1.9\%) of the 105 patients, new cerebral lesions were seen in
   T2-weighted images after 6 months; one patient was neurologically
   symptomatic. All others patients were neurologically unremarkable at
   6-month follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Most postprocedural DW lesions showed no manifestations at
   6-month MR follow-up and were clinically silent. This indicates that
   these lesions are potentially reversible and of no major neurologic
   sequelae. In addition, follow-up 6 months after CAS showed a very low
   incidence of new cerebral lesions and neurologic events.}},

Abstract = {{A stacked plate model for the vibration of multi-layered graphene sheets
   (MLGSs), in which the van der Waals (vdW) interaction between layers is
   described by an explicit formula, is presented. Explicit formulae are
   derived for predicting the natural frequencies of double- and
   triple-layered graphene sheets, and they clearly indicate the effect of
   vdW interaction on the natural frequencies. The natural frequencies are
   calculated for various numbers of layered graphene sheets, and the
   results show that the vdW interaction has no influence on the lowest
   natural frequency (classical frequency) of an MLGS but plays a
   significant role in all higher natural frequencies (resonant
   frequencies) for a given combination of m and n. The vibration modes

   vibration patterns, which indicates that MLGSs are highly suited to use
   as high frequency resonators.}},

Abstract = {{It is known that naive observers have striking misconceptions about
   mirror reflections. In 5 experiments, this article systematically
   extends the findings to graphic stimuli, to interactive visual tasks,
   and finally to tasks involving real mirrors. The results show that the
   perceptual knowledge of nonexpert adults is far superior to their
   conceptual knowledge. Whereas conceptual errors include the assumption
   of left-right reversals in mirror images and often blatant extensions of
   the boundary of mirror space, the perceptual context prevents most such
   errors. However, a consistent bias to misjudge objects in mirrors too
   far to the outside is demonstrable in all cases including tasks with
   real mirrors. The authors present a 2-stage hypothesis consisting of an
   implicit bias of judging the mirror surface to be turned toward the
   observer's line of sight followed by a normalization that becomes
   explicit.}},

Abstract = {{Androgen metabolism may proceed to amplify the action of testosterone by
   its aromatisation to oestradiol. Recently, a growing body of evidence
   suggests a role of oestrogens in the male reproductive tract via their
   specific oestrogen receptors (ERs). In order to check whether androgens
   are converted to oestrogens in the testis, epididymis and prostate of
   the stallion, the expression of aromatase was visualised by means of
   immunohistochemistry. Moreover, to show the cellular targets for
   oestrogens the presence of oestrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) and
   oestrogen receptor beta (ER beta) was demonstrated in these tissues.
   Finally, to show whether naturally occurring cryptorchidism has any
   influence on the localisation of aromatase and distribution of ERs, the
   reproductive tissues of a single horse, bilaterally cryptorchid, were
   also taken for this study. The results demonstrated that aromatase and
   ERs are ubiquitously distributed throughout the male reproductive tract,
   what indicates a putative role of oestrogens in modulating the function
   of the reproductive tissues of the stallion. In the cryptorchid horse
   the increase in conversion of androgen to oestrogen was observed as
   manifested by aromatase overexpression. This is the first report showing
   the cellular site of oestrogen biosynthesis not only in the testis but
   also in the epididymis and prostate of sexually mature stallion and a
   single, adult cryptorchid. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ranolazine (Ranexa, CV Therapeutics) is a partial fatty acid oxidase
   inhibitor that increases the amount of ATP produced from glucose and
   increases the ability of the myocardium to retain functionality despite
   a reduced oxygen supply. Ranolazine is under FDA review for the
   treatment of chronic stable angina (CSA). Ranolazine was first reviewed
   in the August 2003 issue of Formulary. Since the initial review of
   ranolazine by FDA, additional data have emerged that merit an update in
   this journal. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of
   ranolazine as both monotherapy and combination therapy in patients with
   CSA. Recently published clinical trials (MARISA and CARISA) have shown
   an improvement in symptom-limited exercise duration. The results of the
   ERICA trial demonstrated a reduction in weekly anginal attacks when
   ranolazine was added to maximum-dose amlodipine therapy. Headache and
   generalized weakness were the most commonly reported adverse events in
   clinical trials. Prolongation of the QT interval has raised concerns;
   however, a lack of development of ventricular
   tachyarrhythmias-specifically Torsade de Pointes-remains an important
   safety finding.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of air pollution on morbidity and mortality may be mediated by
   alterations in immune competence. In this study we examined short-term
   associations of air pollution exposures with lymphocyte immunophenotypes
   in cord blood among 1,397 deliveries in two districts of the Czech
   Republic. We measured fine particulate matter < 2.5 mu m in diameter
   (PM2.5) and 12 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in 24-hr samples
   collected by versatile air pollution samplers. Cord blood samples were
   analyzed using a FACSort flow cytometer to determine phenotypes of
   CD3(+) T-lymphocytes and their subsets CD4(+) and CD8(+), CD19(+)
   B-lymphocytes, and natural killer cells. The mothers were interviewed
   regarding sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, and medical records
   were abstracted for obstetric, labor and delivery characteristics.
   During the period 1994 to 1998, the mean daily ambient concentration of
   PM2.5 was 24.8 mu g/m(3) and that of PAHs was 63.5 ng/m(3). In multiple
   linear regression models adjusted for temperature, season, and other
   covariates, average PAH or PM2.5 levels during the 14 days before birth
   were associated with decreases in T-lymphocyte phenotype fractions
   (i.e., CD3(+) CD4(+), and CD8(+)), and a clear increase in the
   B-lymphocyte (CD19(+)) fraction. For a 100-ng/m(3) increase in PAHs,
   which represented approximately two standard deviations, the percentage
   decrease was -3.3\% {[}95\% confidence interval (CI), -5.6 to -1.0\%]
   for CD3(+), -3.1\% (95\% Cl, -4.9 to -1.3\%) for CD4(+), and -1.0\%
   (95\% CI, -1.8 to -0.2\%) for CD8(+) cells. The corresponding increase
   in the CD19(+) cell proportion was 1.7\% (95\% Cl, 0.4 to 3.0\%).
   Associations were similar but slightly weaker for PM2.5. Ambient air
   pollution may influence the relative distribution of lymphocyte
   immunophenotypes of the fetus. Key words: air pollution, B-cell, cord

   a matrix Krylov subspace - and on the use of a Galerkin or a minimizing

   introduce weighted global methods. In these methods, the GGHP uses a
   different scalar product at each restart. Experimental results are
   presented to show the good performances of the weighted global methods.}},

Abstract = {{We synthesized and assessed the role of a diacylglycerol
   (DAG)-containing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), that is,
   1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycerol (SDHG), in the contraction of
   guinea pig airway smooth muscle (ASM). We compared its action with
   1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol (SAG) and
   1,2-dioctanoyi-sn-glycerol (1,2-DiC8), a stable DAG analog. The three
   DAGs (SAG, SDHG, and 1,2-DiC8) induced reversible
   concentration-dependent contraction of ASM. SDHG induced higher guinea
   pig ASM contraction than did SAG and 1,2-DiC8. The effects of SDHG were
   blocked, to different extents, by nifedipine (L-type Ca2(+) channel
   blocker). By employing GF-109203X (protein kinase C {[}PKC] inhibitor)
   and lanthanum (La3+), a nonselective cation channel blocker, we observed
   that SDHG evoked ASM contractile response via PKC-dependent and
   PKC-independent (but Ca2+ -dependent) pathways. Interestingly, SAG
   exerted its action only by increasing {[}Ca2+]i and did not require PKC
   activation. To probe the implication of calcium mobilization, we
   employed thapsigargin (TG), which also induced ASM contraction in a
   calcium-dependent manner. SDHG and 1,2-DiC8, in a PKC-dependent manner,
   induced the phosphorylation of CPl-17 (myosin light chain phosphatase
   inhibitor of 17 kD). Furthermore, SAG and TG failed to phosphorylate
   CPl-17 in ASM cells. Our results suggest that different DAG species,
   produced during a dietary supplementation with fatty acids, could
   modulate the reactivity of airway smooth muscles in a PKC-dependent and
   -independent manner, and hence, may play a critical role in health and
   disease.}},

Abstract = {{Context: Irregular bleeding affects many users of combined menopausal
   hormone therapy ( HT) and commonly leads to invasive and expensive
   investigations to exclude underlying malignancy. In most cases no
   abnormality is found.
   Objective: The main objective of this study was to explore the role of
   uterine natural killer (uNK) cells and their regulatory cytokine IL-15
   in irregular bleeding in HT users. Design: This was a prospective
   observational study conducted between 2002 and 2004.
   Setting: The study was conducted in a tertiary referral menopause clinic
   at King Edward Memorial Hospital, Western Australia.
   Patients: Patients included 117 postmenopausal women taking combined HT.
   Interventions: Outpatient endometrial biopsies were taken during and
   outside bleeding episodes.
   Main Outcome Measures: The relationship between endometrial uNK cells (
   CD56+) and bleeding patterns was measured. We also addressed the impact
   of HT exposure on uNK cell populations, the relationship between
   endometrial IL-15 expression and uNK cell populations, and killer Ig
   like receptor genotype in subjects with irregular bleeding.
   Results: Endometrial CD56+ uNK cells were significantly increased in
   biopsies obtained during bleeding episodes ( P<0.001), compared with HT
   users with no bleeding. The highest level of IL-15 expression was also
   seen in biopsies taken during bleeding. No clear relationship between
   killer Ig like receptor genotype and bleeding on HT was observed.
   Conclusions: Little is known about the mechanisms underlying irregular
   bleeding in HT users. This is the first report of uNK cells and their
   association with regulating cytokines in postmenopausal endometrium and
   demonstrates a possible mechanism by which HT may induce irregular
   bleeding.}},

   the quality of the built environment as well as the health, well-being

Abstract = {{A 53-year-old male patient began treatment for systemic exanthema with
   diaphenylsulfone (DHS) on 21 November 2002. On 18 December 2002, the
   patient developed a fever and additional systemic erythematous
   exanthema. Systemic lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, leukocytosis
   (in particular, an increase in the number of atypical lymphocytes) and
   liver dysfunction followed. After cessation of the DHS treatment on 25
   December 2002, acute renal failure occurred and the patient was
   transferred to Shinshu University Hospital on 4 January 2003. The
   patient was diagnosed with drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome
   (DIHS). Steroid pulse therapy (methylprednisolone 1000 mg/day for 3
   days) was given, followed by 60 mg/day of prednisolone. The patient's
   renal functions recovered and he was taken off hemodialysis therapy.
   However, the patient relapsed twice despite two sessions of steroid
   pulse therapy and an increase in the dose of prednisolone to 100 mg/day.
   Plasma exchange (PE) was carried out to reduce the activity of the
   disease. With a total of four plasma exchanges, we were able to reduce
   the dose of prednisolone from 100 mg/day to 60 mg/day without relapse.
   There were no adverse effects from the plasma exchanges. Plasma exchange
   should be considered in the treatment with corticosteroid-resistant DIHS
   with multiple organ lesions.}},

Abstract = {{Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is an attractive method for assaying
   gene function in species that are resistant to conventional genetic
   approaches. However, VIGS has been shown to be effective in only a few,
   closely related plant species. Tobacco rattle virus (TRV), a bipartite
   RNA virus, has a wide host range and so in principle could serve as an
   efficient vector for VIGS in a diverse array of plant species. Here we
   show that a vector based on TRV sequences is effective at silencing the
   endogenous phytoene desaturase (PapsPDS) gene in Papaver somniferum
   (opium poppy). We show that this vector does not compromise the growth
   or reproduction of poppy and the plants did not display viral symptoms.
   The silencing of PapsPDS resulted in a significant reduction in PapsPDS
   mRNA and a concomitant photobleached phenotype. The ability to rapidly
   assay gene function in A somniferum will be valuable in manipulation of
   the opiate pathway in this pharmaceutically important species. We
   suggest that our vacuum infiltration method used to deliver TRV-based
   vectors into poppy is a promising approach for expanding VIGS to diverse
   angiosperm species in which traditional delivery methods fail to induce
   VIGS. Furthermore, these studies demonstrate the utility of TRV-VIGS for
   probing gene function in a basal eudicot species that is
   phylogenetically distant from model plant species.}},

Abstract = {{Color vision is useful for detecting surface boundaries and identifying
   objects. Are the signals used to perform these two functions processed
   by common mechanisms, or has the visual system optimized its processing
   separately for each task? We measured the effect of mean chromaticity
   and luminance on color discriminability and on color appearance under
   well-matched stimulus conditions. In the discrimination experiments, a
   pedestal spot was presented in one interval and a pedestal + test in a
   second. Observers indicated which interval contained the test. In the
   appearance experiments, observers matched the appearance of test spots
   across a change in background. We analyzed the data using a variant of
   Fechner's proposal, that the rate of apparent stimulus change is
   proportional to visual sensitivity. We found that saturating visual
   response functions together with a model of adaptation that included
   multiplicative gain control and a subtractive term accounted for data
   from both tasks. This result suggests that effects of the contexts we
   studied on color appearance and discriminability are controlled by the
   same underlying mechanism. (c) 2005 Optical Society of America.}},

Abstract = {{Liver metastasis is common in pancreatic cancer patients, and the
   current treatments are insufficient to improve the clinical outcome.
   Recently, tumor-targeted replication-competent viruses have been
   developed as cancer therapy. The aim of this study was to clarify the
   efficacy of oncolytic reovirus against liver metastases from pancreatic
   cancer in immunocompetent models. Reovirus serotype 3 and three hamster
   pancreatic cancer cell lines (HPD1NR, HPD2NR, and HaP-T1) were used in
   this study. The susceptibility of reovirus to these cell lines was
   examined. The effect of intraportal administration of reovirus against
   metastatic liver tumors was evaluated in vivo. Reovirus infected all
   cell lines and propagated via an activated Ras signalling pathway in
   vitro. In syngeneic hamster models using the HPD2NR cell line,
   intraportal administration of reovirus significantly decreased the
   number and size of treated tumors in comparison with non-treated tumors.
   Immunohistochemical examination revealed reovirus replication within the
   tumor cells but not in the surrounding normal tissue and organs. There
   were no reovirus-related toxicities and deaths. Our results indicate
   that intraportal administration of reovirus is effective and safe in
   immunocompetent and syngeneic hamster models of liver metastases from
   pancreatic cancer, suggesting that reovirus can be developed into an
   effective therapeutic modality in future.}},

Abstract = {{The pulse-driven Josephson junction array is a promising candidate for
   an accurate waveform synthesizer. The accuracy of the synthesized
   waveform is chiefly limited by the in-band frequency components of the
   driving current because they couple to the output signal through
   parasitic circuit elements and are difficult to filter out. In this
   study, we propose a more accurate waveform synthesis method, in which
   the array is driven by current pulses which have the same waveform as
   the impulse response of the ideal bandpass filter. Simulations have
   shown that the current amplitude of the constant-voltage step of a
   junction driven by the filtered pulses exceeds 70\% of the Josephson
   critical current in a wide range of output signals. Synthesis of a sine
   wave using this method was also demonstrated by simulation. (c) 2005

Title = {{Consistent 3D geometrical model of fabric elementary cell. Application
   to a meshing preprocessor for 3D finite element analysis}},
Journal = {{FINITE ELEMENTS IN ANALYSIS AND DESIGN}},

Abstract = {{Many different methods can be used to obtain a composite part. Among
   them, several require the forming of a dry fabric before the resin is
   injected. The mechanical properties of the obtained part depend to a
   large extent on the mechanical behavior of the dry fabric. Experimental
   methods are efficient to identify this behavior, but they need to be
   complemented with numerical approaches. Among the numerical approaches,
   3D finite element simulation is very interesting but requires an
   accurate 3D mesh of the fabric elementary cell. In this paper, we are
   proposing a new consistent 3D geometrical model of 2D fabrics.
   Experimental observations using different optical processes have been
   performed in order to determine real yam geometry in different cases of
   yarn structure and weaving. The analysis of these results helps us
   define the accurate generic 3D model of a yarn shape when it is weaved.
   Using this model of a yam, a consistent 3D geometrical model of 2D
   fabrics is presented. One particularity of this model is that it ensures
   a realistic contact surface between yams without interpenetration for
   all types of weaving. The section shape varies along the trajectory, so
   that the influence of contact between yarns on their cross section shape
   can be taken into account. This model can be easily identified using
   three to seven parameters measured on a real fabric. A meshing
   preprocessor based on this geometrical model is then developed. It
   substantially reduces the time needed to obtain an accurate hexahedral
   mesh of the elementary cell of a fabric. This is an important point for
   the 3D finite element simulation of fabrics, which is a powerful method
   to investigate their mechanical behavior. Examples of shear and biaxial
   extension are presented to show the efficiency of the whole simulation
   chain. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last five years, a great deal of research effort has been
   concentrated on the development of a new data model ISO 14649,
   informally known as STEP-NC. It has been strongly argued that STEP-NC
   has huge implications on the integration of the computer-aided
   design/computer-aided process planning/computer-aided manufacture
   (CAD/CAPP/CAM) (CAx) systems, giving the opportunity to realize
   interoperable computer numerical control (CNC) manufacturing. This is
   largely owing to the data model, which provides the capability to
   revolutionize the current state of the art in CNC manufacturing by
   offering a bi-directional interface with a high-level description of the
   geometrical and manufacturing information. This paper provides a view of
   how these STEP-NC compliant information models can be used to support
   the wire electrical discharge machining (WEDM) CAD to the CNC process
   chain. The models are based on part 13 of the ISO 14649 standard, which
   is dedicated to the WEDM process, together with part 10 of the standard,
   which specifies the general machining information. The information
   models have been identified and their structures have been defined and
   modelled using the unified modelling language (UML). A STEP-NC compliant
   WEDM CAx prototype system, based on the Java and the object-oriented
   database management system (DBMS) ObjectStore, has been constructed with
   an example case study to demonstrate the information models.}},

   Methods: Four hundred and forty-two SLE patients from the LUMINA (Lupus
   in Minorities: Nature vs Nurture) cohort, a multiethnic (Hispanics from
   Texas, n = 99 and Puerto Rico, n = 36; African Americans, n = 172; and
   Caucasians, n = 135) cohort, were studied by generalized estimating
   equation (GEE) to determine the relationship between antiphospholipid
   (aPL) antibodies (measured as IgG and IgM aPL antibodies and/or the
   lupus anticoagulant) at enrolment or historically prior to enrolment,
   hydroxychloroquine use (ever) and the occurrence of thrombotic (central
   and/or peripheral, arterial and/or venous) events after adjusting for
   known and possible confounders {[}socioeconomic-demographic features,
   smoking, disease activity and damage, serum cholesterol levels,
   anti-oxidized low-density lipoprotein IgG and IgM antibodies, and
   high-sensitivity (hs) C-reactive protein]. Postanalysis correlation
   between aPL and anticardiolipin (aCL) assays was attempted by performing
   aCL assays on random samples of patients whose aPL status was known.
   Results. A number of clinical variables were significant in the
   univariable analyses; however, in the multivariable GEE analyses, only
   smoking {[}odds ratio (OR) 2.777, 95\% confidence interval (CI)
   1.317-5.852] and disease activity as measured by the SLAM (Systemic
   Lupus Activity Measure) (OR 1.099; 95\% CI 1.053-1.147) were
   significant. In particular, hydroxychloroquine use, which appeared to be
   protective against thrombotic events in the univariable analyses, was
   not retained in the multivariable analyses. aPL antibodies were not
   significant in either analysis. Few additional aPL-positive patients
   emerged from the validation study.
   Conclusions. Smoking and disease activity emerged as important
   determinants in the occurrence of thrombotic events in our patients.
   Comprehensive treatment strategies should be directed to both smoking
   cessation and control of disease activity in patients with SLE.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The deflection of the HR performance curve (HRPC) has been
   described as an objective marker of submaxinial exercise performance. HR
   response to incremental cycle ergometer exercise is shown to be neither
   linear nor uniform and a physiological explanation of the deflection
   phenomenon is lacking. We hypothesized that differences in the
   beta(1)-adrenoceptor site are the source of these differences. The aim
   of the study was to investigate the influence of the highly selective
   beta(1)-adrenoceptor (beta(1)-AR) antagonist bisoprolol (Bi) on the HRPC
   in young healthy male subjects with different HR response patterns.
   Methods: Sixteen subjects were treated in randomized order with Bi or a
   Placebo (Pl) in two separate trials. HR response during incremental
   cycle ergometer exercise was compared between the two trials. Blood
   lactate concentration (La) and ventilatory variables were measured
   throughout both tests. Results: Bi changed the direction of the HRPC
   more in subject, with a regular, s-shaped response pattern under placebo
   than those with a nonregular or linear pattern. The influence of Bi on
   the HR at the second lactate turn point was significantly related (R =
   0.78; P < 0.001) to the pattern of the HRPC in PI conditions.
   Conclusion: We suggest that differences between the subjects with
   regular s-shaped versus nonregular HRPC may be due to differences at the
   beta(1)-AR site. The origin of the HRPC deflection is mediated in part
   by the beta(1)-AR sensitivity.}},

Abstract = {{Leprosy control programmes are highly successful. As a result, leprosy
   control will be more and more integrated into the general health
   services. The existing vertical, specialized control programmes will be
   dismantled. Eye complications in leprosy have decreased. This is a
   result of earlier diagnosis and highly effective multidrug treatment
   (MDT) of leprosy, combined with timely treatment of secondary nerve
   damage by steroids. Most ocular morbidity is now found among elderly and
   disabled leprosy patients who were diagnosed before effective MDT
   treatment became available. Many of these patients live in leprosy
   settlements. Age-related cataract has become the leading cause of
   blindness in leprosy. The second cause of blindness is corneal
   opacification, mainly as a result of neglected exposure keratitis and
   corneal anaesthesia. The miotic pupils in late multibacillary leprosy,
   in combination with small central lens opacities, may also lead to
   blindness. The Vision 2020 Initiative prioritises cataract surgery.
   Leprosy patients should be actively included. Disabled leprosy patients
   can also benefit from screening programmes for refractive errors and the
   provision of spectacles and low vision aids. Determining the most
   feasible surgical methods for lagophthalmos surgery remains a challenge.
   For all health and eye care staff, training in leprosy and its eye
   complications is needed, as well as a change in attitude towards leprosy
   patients. Staff must be prepared to welcome them in the general health

Abstract = {{A series of different fluorinated polymer platforms used for early and
   current 157-nm photoresists is investigated with regard to blanket etch
   properties and surface roughness. Besides methacrylic-based polymers
   applied for 193-nm lithography, fluorine containing norbornene
   homopolymers, fluorinated cycloolefines, and tetrafluoroethylene (TFE)
   norbornene copolymers are chosen. Etch rates in different plasmas used
   for several applications, such as poly, SiN mask open, and
   selective/nonselective SiO2 etch, are determined and compared to
   standard 193-nm platforms currently used for DRAM manufacturing. Looking
   at various base resins, significant differences can be found using HBr-
   or CI2-based poly etch conditions and various fluorocarbon-based oxide
   etch chemistries. Up to 2.4 times higher etch rates in CI2 and the
   different CxFy oxide etch recipes are observed for the highly
   fluorinated cycloolefines and the TFE norbornenes, showing a strong
   correlation between fluorine content and etch rate. After stress by
   different etch conditions, the polymer surfaces are characterized using
   atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
   Surprisingly, the surface roughness of the methacrylic platforms and the
   norbornene base resin (determined by AFM) are found to be substantially
   higher than that of the highly fluorinated platforms. These results can
   directly be correlated to pictures obtained by optical methods (SEM).

Abstract = {{Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) regulates factor X activation.
   LowTFPI is a risk factor for a first venous thrombosis. We evaluated
   whether lowTFPI confers an increased risk of recurrent venous
   thromboembolism (VTE). TFPI-free antigen was measured in 611 patients
   with a first spontaneous VTE, and who were prospectively followed after
   withdrawal of anticoagulation. The endpoint was symptomatic recurrent
   VTE. The relative risk (RR) of recurrence increased from 1.0 (95\% CI
   0.4-2.6) in patients with TFPI levels <= 5(th) percentile to 2.7 (95\%
   CI 1.0-7.4) in patients with levels <= 2(nd) percentile as compared with
   higher levels. At five years, the probability of recurrence was 48.6\%
   (95(th) CI 19.0-78.1) among patients with TFPI <= 2(nd) percentile and
   16.8\% (95(th) CI 13.8-19.8) among those with higher levels (p=0.04).
   Compared to patients with wild type factor V and high TFPI, the RR of
   recurrence was 1.1 (95\% CI 0.7-1.7) in patients with factorV Leiden and
   high TFPI, 2.3 (95\% CI 0.6-9.5) in patients with wild type factorV and
   low TFPI and 3.5 (95\% CI 0.9-14.3) in patients with factorV Leiden and
   low TFPI. In a multivariate analysis, the high risk of recurrence in
   carriers of factorV Leiden and lowTFPI slightly decreased {[}RR 2.8
   (95\% CI 0.6-9.5)]. We conclude that thrombosis patients with low levels
   of free TFPI are at an increased risk of recurrent VTE.}},

Abstract = {{Weather radar wind profiles (WRWPs) have been retrieved from Doppler
   volume scans using different implementations of the velocity-azimuth
   display (VAD) and volume velocity processing (VVP) methods. An extensive
   quality control of the radial velocity data and the retrieved wind
   vectors has been applied. The quality and availability of the obtained
   wind profiles have been assessed by comparisons with collocated
   radiosonde observations and numerical weather prediction (NWP) data over
   a 9-month period. The comparisons reveal that the VVP methods perform
   better than the VAD methods, and that the simplest implementation of the
   VVP (VVP1) method performs the best of all. The availability fraction of
   VVP1 wind vectors is about 0.39 at ground level and drops below 0.16 at
   a 6-km altitude. The observation minus background statistics of the VVP1
   wind profiles against the High Resolution Limited Area Model (HIRLAM)
   NWP model are at least as good as those of the radiosonde profiles. This
   result clearly demonstrates the high quality of (quality controlled)

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional reacting flow modeling approach is presented for
   diesel engine studies that can be used for predictions of trends in soot
   emissions for a wide range of operating conditions. The modeling
   framework employs skeletal chemistry for n-heptane for ignition and
   combustion, and links acetylene chemistry to the soot nucleation
   process. The soot model is based on integration and modification of
   existing submodels for soot nucleation, agglomeration, oxidation, and
   surface growth. With the optimized modeling parameters, the simulations
   agree well with results of high-pressure shock tube studies of rich
   n-heptane mixtures, reproducing the trends for soot mass over a range of
   temperature and pressure conditions (T = 1550-2050 K, P = 20, 40, and 80
   MPa). Engine simulation results for soot mass are in excellent agreement
   with diesel engine smoke number measurements over a range of injection
   timings (-11 degrees ATDC-2.4 degrees ATDC) and two exhaust gas
   recirculation levels (16 and 26-27\%). The model results demonstrate
   that correct description of the soot formation, as well as the soot
   transport processes, is critical for achieving reliable predictive
   capabilities in engine simulations. (c) 2005 The Combustion Institute.

Abstract = {{Shaking table tests were performed on five model slopes to examine the
   effects of the angle and length of the nails and the frequency of
   excitation on the seismic resistance and failure mechanism of the
   slopes. Seismic excitation was also applied to slopes at various angles.
   Experimental results showed that nails markedly improved the seismic
   resistance of all model steep slopes. Additionally, nailed slopes
   exhibit characteristics of ductility under strong excitation. The angle
   of the nails influences the deformation of the slope but only slightly
   affects seismic resistance. An increase in the length of the nails
   increased the seismic resistance of the slope and reduced the
   displacement of the facing only when subjected to strong excitation. The
   slope at an angle of 90 degrees to the horizontal has a markedly lower
   seismic resistance than that at 80 degrees. The rocking of the model
   slope was strong for the slope with inclined nails and the slope at 90
   degrees to the horizontal. The failure surface of the soil mass is
   approximately a bilinear surface; the pullout of nails from the lower
   rows of nails caused total slope failure. The seismic resistance of a
   nailed slope is categorized viz. response of the models by three stages:
   stable, seismic resistance, and incipient collapse phases. Critical
   seismic acceleration coefficients of all models are evaluated and
   compared with values predicted by a developed pseudo-static,
   limit-equilibrium-based slope stability approach, which postulates a
   two-wedge failure mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{The role of habit strength and past behaviour were studied in order to
   gain a better understanding of seafood consumption behaviour. A sample
   of Norwegian adults (N = 1579) responded to a self-administered
   questionnaire about seafood consumption habits, past frequency of
   seafood consumption, and attitude towards and intention to eat seafood.
   Structural equation modelling revealed that past behaviour and habit,
   rather than attitudes, were found to explain differences in intention,
   indicating that forming intention does not necessarily have to be
   reasoned. The results also indicated that When a strong habit is
   present, the expression of an intention might be guided by the salience
   of past behaviour rather than by attitudes. The findings of this study
   might thus have consequences for dietary interventions. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{We studied the cryopreservation of the most common coccolithophore,
   Emiliania huxleyi which is considered as one of the main global carbon
   cycle participants. Both stages of this complex life cycle species were
   submitted to gradual addition of three distinct cryoprotectants:
   dimethylsulfoxide (7.5\% v/v), methanol (5\% v/v) and proline (0.5 M).
   They were then control-rate cooled (-5 degrees C min(-1)) to -50 degrees
   C before plunging into liquid nitrogen. Free radical oxygen species have
   been proposed to occur in cells subjected to pre-freezing manipulation
   or to cooling. Therefore, catalase (preventing accumulation of hydroxyl
   radicals) was evaluated for its ability to improve cell viability before
   and after freezing-thawing challenge.
   With the exception of proline which induced a decrease in diploid cell
   proliferation, cryoprotectants had no deleterious effects. On the
   contrary, growth of the haploid stage was enhanced by each CPA
   treatment, suggesting mixotrophic growth. Cryopreservation succeeded
   when dimethylsulfoxide was used, and the late exponential phase was
   obtained as soon as the 15th post-thawing day. Cell densities were then
   similar to the unfrozen controls. Catalase had no beneficial effect on
   the ability of cells to grow, neither prior freezing nor after thawing.
   In comparison with former attempts to cryopreserve E. huxleyi in other
   culture collection centers, our protocols allowed faster recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine associations of weight history with functional
   limitations and disability in white and African-American men and women.
   Research Methods and Procedures: Data were from the Atherosclerosis Risk
   in Communities study (n = 11,177). Associations of recalled weight
   status at age 25 and weight change from age 25 to ages 45 to 64 with
   functional limitations, activities of daily living (ADLs), and
   instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) at follow-up (ages 52 to
   75) were examined using logistic regression.
   Results: Obesity (BMI >= 30 kg/m(2)) at age 25 was associated with
   functional limitations and ADL and IADL impairment at follow-up in white
   and African-American men and women. For example, obese compared with
   normal weight (BMI, 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m(2)) white women had higher odds of
   mild {[}odds ratio (95\% confidence interval), 1.97 (1.18 to 3.29)] and
   severe {[}9.81 (5.92 to 16.27)] functional limitations and ADL {[}3.48
   (2.36 to 5.13)] and IADL {[}2.95 (2.00 to 4.33)] impairment. In
   African-American women, obesity was associated with higher odds of mild
   {[}2.71 (1.14 to 6.41)] and severe {[}6.01 (2.53 to 14.26)] functional
   limitations and ADL {[}1.82 (1.10 to 3.00)] and IADL {[}2.39 (1.47 to
   3.90)] impairment. Similar associations were found in men. Compared with
   weight maintenance (+/- 10 lbs), large weight gain (> 30 lbs) from age
   25 to ages 45 to 64 was also associated with functional limitations and
   ADL and IADL impairment in white and African-American men and women.
   Discussion: Maintenance of a healthy body weight throughout adulthood
   may play a role in preventing or delaying the onset of functional
   limitations and disability, resulting in increased quality of life and
   decreased health care costs.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue microarray (TMA) technology allows the miniaturization and
   characterization of multiple tissue samples on a single slide and
   commonly uses formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue or
   acetone-fixed frozen tissue. The former provides good morphology but can
   compromise antigenicity, whereas the latter provides compromised
   morphology with good antigenicity. Here, we report the development of
   TMAs in glycol methacrylate resin, which combine the advantages of both
   methods in one embedding format. Freshly collected tissue fixed in -20C
   acetone or 10\% neutral buffered formaldehyde were cored and arrayed
   into an intermediary medium of 2\% agarose before infiltration of the
   agarose array with glycol methacrylate resin. Acetone-fixed resin TMA
   demonstrated improved morphology over acetone-fixed frozen TMA, with no
   loss of antigenicity. Staining for extracellular, cell surface, and
   nuclear antigens could be realized with monoclonal and polyclonal
   antibodies as well as with monomeric single-chain Fv preparations. In
   addition, when compared with FFPE TMA, formalin-fixed tissue in a resin
   TMA gave enhanced morphology and subcellular detail. Therefore, resin
   provides a universal format for the construction of TMAs, providing
   improved tissue morphology while retaining antigenicity, allows
   thin-section preparation, and could be used to replace preparation of
   frozen and FFPE TMAs for freshly collected tissue.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To report the microbial culture results, clinical course, and
   visual outcomes for infectious keratitis related to overnight
   orthokeratology.
   Methods: The records of patients with infectious keratitis related to
   overnight orthokeratology who presented to a tertiary referral center
   from April 2000 to March 2003 were retrospectively reviewed.
   Results: Twenty patients (21 eyes) were included; 1 patient had
   bilateral infections. The average age of the patients was 14 years. The
   average period between the time the patient started the overnight
   orthokeratology program and the onset of infectious keratitis was 23
   months. Thirteen of the 21 eyes were culture positive. Organisms
   cultured were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 9), coagulase-negative
   Staphylococcus species (n = 2), Serratia marcescens (n = 1), and
   Acathamoeba species (n = 1). All patients responded well to medical
   antimicrobial treatment. Final best spectacle-corrected visual acuity
   ranged from 20/20 to 20/100.
   Conclusions: Infectious keratitis is a potential complication of
   overnight orthokeratology that may cause significant visual impairment.
   Parents of children who consider overnight orthokeratology should
   evaluate the benefit of temporary myopia reduction and the risk of
   infection.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the endothelial
   wound healing effects of SV40 large T and small t antigen transduction
   on cultured human corneal endothelial cells (HCEC).
   Methods: Human corneal endothelial cells were infected with either mock
   solution, Ad green fluorescent protein (GFP), or Ad SV40 T/t
   antigen/GFP, then mechanically wounded 48 h later. The endothelial wound
   healing rate was quantified by an analysis of the photographs taken
   every 12 h after wounding. The characteristics of Ad SV40 T/t
   Ag/GFP-infected human corneal endothelial cells were evaluated with cell
   morphology, cell density, contact inhibition, and cytoskeletal features
   using rhodamine phalloidin to stain F-actin. DNA synthesis was assessed
   using 5-Bromo-2 `-deoxy-uridine (BrdU) labeling.
   Results: Wound healing rates in the first 12 and 24 h after wounding
   were significantly faster in the Ad SV40 T/t antigen/GFP-infected group
   than the other two groups. In all three groups, the morphology, cell
   density, and cytoskeletal features of cells at confluency was similar
   and contact inhibition retained. There were no differences in the
   pattern of F-actin and endothelial cell density 4 d after wound closure.
   However, during the process of wound healing, prominent stress fibers in
   migrating cells near the wound edge were noted in normal cells at 36 h
   after wounding, whereas the Ad SV40 T/t Ag/GFP-infected cells showed
   similar changes as early as 12 h after wounding. BrdU staining results
   revealed that the Ad SV40 T/t antigen/GFP-infected group had labeled
   cells showing DNA synthesis in the wound area at 12 h after wounding,
   while no labeled cells were found in the other two groups.
   Conclusions: In an in vitro model, transduction of human corneal
   endothelial cells using a recombinant adenoviral vector expressing SV40
   T/t antigen enhanced both the wound healing rate and proliferative
   capacity, especially in the first 12 h after wounding, and the
   characteristic morphologic features of the infected cells were
   maintained.}},

Abstract = {{The anodic films formed on AZ91D magnesium alloy after heat treatment
   were analyzed and their electrochemical properties were investigated.
   The results showed that the cooling rate had a significant influence on
   the microstructure evolution of the AZ91D magnesium alloy after solution
   heat treatment at 440 degrees C for 20 h in N-2 atmosphere. A
   single-phase microstructure was observed when the alloy was quenched in
   water after solution heat treatment. However, a duplex structure
   consisting of both alpha and P phases was found if the solution-annealed
   alloy was cooled in air. The differences in microstructure of the heat
   treated AZ91D magnesium alloy gave rise to a significant change in the
   property of the anodic film formed in 3 M KOH + 0.21 M Na3PO4 + 0.6 M KF
   + 0.15 M Al(NO3)(3) electrolyte. During the early stage of anodization,
   for the as-cast alloy, inhomogeneous anodic films were formed exhibiting
   relative rough surface appearances. A rather smooth anodic film was
   formed for the solution-annealed AZ91D magnesium alloy either followed
   by air cooling or water-quenched. The surface and cross section
   appearance was almost the same regardless of the prior heat treatment
   after anodizing for 20 min. The corrosion resistances of the various
   anodized AZ91D magnesium alloy were evaluated and compared by employing
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results demonstrate
   that the anodic film formed on the water-quenched AZ91D magnesium alloy
   had a slightly higher polarization resistance than that formed on the
   as-cast alloy. The highest polarization resistance of anodic film was
   found for that formed on annealed and air-cooled alloy. The presence of
   Al-rich beta phase on the surface gave rise to the fort-nation of a more
   protective anodic film which consisted of a great amount of Al2O3.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{28}},
Pages = {{5617-5623}},

Abstract = {{gamma-poly(glutamic acid) (gamma-PGA), a hydrophilic and biodegradable
   polymer, was chosen to modify chitosan matrices to produce a
   gamma-PGA/chitosan composite biomaterial. Three types of both dense and
   porous composite matrices containing different amounts of PGA were
   fabricated. Chitosan and gamma-PGA matrices were also prepared as
   controls. Fluorescence staining indicated that chitosan and gamma-PGA
   were evenly distributed in the composite matrices. SEM micrographs
   showed that an interconnected porous structure with a pore size of 30
   100 mu m was present in all porous matrices except the gamma-PGA ones.
   By increasing the percentage of gamma-PGA from 0\% to 20\%, the swelling
   ratio of the matrices was enhanced from 1.6 to 3.2. Similarly, the
   contact angle of the matrices decreased from 113 degrees to 94 degrees.
   These data suggested that the surface hydrophilicity, water absorption
   rate, and swelling ratio were improved by adding gamma-PGA to the
   matrices. Additionally, the mechanical strength of the porous
   gamma-PGA/chitosan matrices was about 25 50\%, higher than that of the
   unmodified chitosan matrices. The composite matrices were also examined
   and found to be an appropriate environment for cell attachment and
   proliferation. The cell density on the 20\% gamma-PGA-modified matrices
   was almost triple that on the unmodified chitosan matrices on day 5. In
   summary, the gamma-PGA/chitosan composite matrices. due to their better
   hydrophilic, cytocompatible, and mechanical properties, are very
   promising biomaterials for tissue engineering applications. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Background Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) is becoming a
   promising vector for gene therapy for type I diabetes. The objective of
   this study was to investigate the effect of incorporation of
   polyethylenimine (PEI) on rAAV-mediated insulin gene therapy in vitro
   and in vivo.
   Methods Recombinant AAV vector, harboring the furin-mutated human
   insulin and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) genes, was
   constructed. The effect of complexation with PEI on rAAV-mediated gene
   transfer was examined in Huh7 human hepatoma cells. The transgene
   expression was also examined in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic
   C57BL/6J mice by direct administration of rAAV into the livers of the
   animals, followed by monitoring changes in body weight and blood glucose
   levels. Secretion of human insulin was determined by radioimmunoassay
   (RIA) and immunohistochemical staining in the livers.
   Results Complexation with PEI was shown to enhance rAAV-mediated
   transgene expression in Huh7 cells, resulting in higher transduction
   efficiency and enhanced production of immunoreactive human insulin.
   Heparin competition assay demonstrated that endocytosis of rAAV-PEI was
   partially inhibited by heparin. The enhancement of rAAV-mediated
   transgene expression was also demonstrated in the animals, showing
   lowering of blood glucose and longer duration of normoglycemia.
   Immunofluorescent staining of the liver sections demonstrated that PEI
   increased the uptake of rAAV and enhanced insulin secretion. The
   enhancement of PEI on rAAV-mediated insulin gene therapy was further
   confirmed by glucose challenge and a 10-h fasting blood glucose test.
   Conclusions Results obtained in this study demonstrated that
   incorporation of PEI augmented rAAV-mediated insulin gene transfer and
   enhanced amelioration of hyperglycemia in the STZ-induced diabetic
   animals. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most frequent cause of inherited mental
   retardation and is largely caused by a loss of expression of fragile X
   mental retardation protein (FMRP), encoded by fragile X retardation
   gene-1 (Fmrl). FMRP is a multifunction protein, with intrinsic
   RNA-binding properties, which is a component of ribonucleoprotein
   complex associated with polyribosomes. The properties of FMRP indicate
   that it might participate in post-transcriptional processes in the
   regulation of some mRNA species, including localization, stability and
   translational control. However, the function of FMRP related to the
   pathologenesis in FXS is largely unknown. Many efforts were undertaken
   to identify the putative specific RNA targets as well as the
   FMRP-related proteins and to identify the effect of FMRP absence on the
   corresponding proteins. Here we present our efforts using proteomics
   approach to explore the differential expression profiling of mouse
   cerebella immortal cell, in which we changed the expression of FMRP by
   expressing Fmrl gene with nuclear export signal (NES) mutation. This
   mutation makes FMRP unable to shuttle from nucleus to cytoplasm and
   leads to nuclear instead of cytoplasmic location as usual, which was
   hypothesized to affect the pathways of groups of RNAs or proteins
   related with FMRP. In present study, 56 proteins were found to be
   differentially expressed in transfected R2 neuronal cells, including 16
   decreased expressions and 40 increased expressions. The differentially
   expressed proteins play roles in diverse physiological processes, such
   as neuronal plasticity, spermatogenesis and craniofacial and limb
   development etc. In addition, the expressions of three mRNA identified
   as FMRP targets in fragile X cell were tested in present model cells.
   All these results provide new insights to the role of FMRP in the
   disease.}},

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional inverse geometry problem, that is, a shape

   interfacial geometry in this work; thus, it is classified as the
   function estimation in the inverse calculation. The accuracy of the
   inverse analysis is examined using simulated temperature measurements.
   This approach can be applied to many applications, such as interfacial
   geometry identification for phase change (Stefan) problems. Numerical
   experiments using different numbers of sensors, measurement errors, and
   positions are performed to justify the validity of the present algorithm
   in solving the shape identification problem. Finally it is concluded
   that the conjugate gradient method can estimate the reliable interfacial
   configuration.}},

Abstract = {{AIM: To investigate the occurrence of resistance to a full dose of oral
   ivermectin by Cooperia curticei in sheep.
   METHODS: Twelve lambs on a sheep and cattle property in the North Island
   of New Zealand were randomly allocated to one of two equal-sized groups.
   One group was treated orally with a single dose of ivermectin at the
   manufacturer's recommended dose rate of 0.2 mg/kg, while the other
   remained as an untreated control. Worm counts were carried out post
   mortem on the abomasa and small intestines of all animals in both groups
   7 days after treatment.
   RESULTS: While treatment with ivermectin reduced the numbers of all
   other worm genera to almost zero, those of Ostertagia (= Telodorsagia)
   circumcincta and C curticei were reduced by only 37\% and 19\%,
   respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: These results provide clear evidence of resistance to
   ivermectin by O. circumcincta and C. curticei. They also appear to
   represent the first record of macrocylic lactone (ML) resistance in C
   curticei in sheep in New Zealand or elsewhere.}},

Abstract = {{Intense prescribed fire has been suggested as a possible method for
   forest restoration in mixed conifer forests. In 1993, a prescribed fire
   in a dense, never-harvested forest on the North Rim of Grand Canyon
   National Park escaped prescription and burned with greater intensity and
   severity than expected. We sampled this burned area and an adjacent
   unburned area to assess fire effects on understory species composition,
   diversity, and plant cover. The unburned area was sampled in 1998 and
   the burned area in 1999; 25\% of the plots were resampled in 2001 to
   ensure that differences between sites were consistent and persistent,
   and not due to inter-annual climatic differences. Species composition
   differed significantly between unburned and burned sites; eight species
   were identified as indicators of the unburned site and thirteen as
   indicators of the burned site. Plant cover was nearly twice as great in
   the burned site than in the unburned site in the first years of
   measurement and was 4.6 times greater in the burned site in 2001.
   Average and total species richness was greater in the burned site,
   explained mostly by higher numbers of native annual and biennial forbs.
   Overstory canopy cover and duff depth were significantly lower in the
   burned site, and there were significant inverse relationships between
   these variables and plant species richness and plant cover. Greater than
   95\% of the species in the post-fire community were native and exotic
   plant cover never exceeded 1\%, in contrast with other northern Arizona
   forests that were dominated by exotic species following high-severity
   fires. This difference is attributed to the minimal anthropogenic
   disturbance history (no logging, minimal grazing) of forests in the
   national park, and suggests that park managers may have more options
   than non-park managers to use intense fire as a tool for forest
   conservation and restoration.}},

Title = {{A metalloproteinase of Coccidioides posadasii contributes to evasion of

Abstract = {{Coccidioides posadasii is a fungal respiratory pathogen of humans that
   can cause disease in immunocompetent individuals. Coccidioidomycosis
   ranges from a mild to a severe infection. It is frequently characterized
   either as a persistent disease that requires months to resolve or as an
   essentially asymptomatic infection that can reactivate several years
   after the original insult. In this report we describe a mechanism by
   which the pathogen evades host detection during the pivotal reproductive
   (endosporulation) phase of the parasitic cycle. A metalloproteinase
   (Mep1) secreted during endospore differentiation digests an
   immunodominant cell surface antigen (SOWgp) and prevents host
   recognition of endospores during the phase of development when these
   fungal cells are most vulnerable to phagocytic cell defenses. C57BL/6
   mice were immunized with recombinant SOWgp and then challenged with a
   mutant strain of C. posadasii in which the MEPI gene was disrupted. The
   animals showed a significant increase in percent survival compared to
   SOWgp-immune mice challenged with the parental strain. To explain these
   results, we proposed that retention of SOWgp on the surfaces of
   endospores of the mutant strain in the presence of high titers of
   antibody to the immunodominant antigen contributes to opsonization,
   increased phagocytosis, and killing of the fungal cells. In vitro
   studies of the interaction between a murine alveolar macrophage cell
   line and parasitic cells coated with SOWgp showed that the addition of
   anti-SOWgp antibody could enhance phagocytosis and killing of
   Coccidioides. We suggest that Mep1 plays a pivotal role as a
   pathogenicity determinant during coccidioidal infections and contributes
   to the ability of the pathogen to persist within the mammalian host.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine the effects of dietary fat
   on the development of atherosclerosis and changes in blood lipids in
   rabbits. Forty New Zealand White rabbits were divided into 5 groups and
   fed commercial rabbit chow with 0\% oil (control), 2\% com oil, 2\% fish
   oil, 2\% oxidized oil, or 2\% heated com oil. Cholesterol (CHO, 1.5-g/kg
   diet) was added to all the experimental diets. The rabbits in the
   control and oxidized oil groups developed the highest scores for
   atherosclerotic lesions but those fed fish oil, corn oil, and the heated
   com oil groups had the lowest lesion scores. Plasma triacylglycerol,
   total CHO, and low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein CHO
   levels (P <.05) in rabbits followed the trend of higher levels
   consistent with scores for atherosclerotic lesions. Plasma total CHO
   level was one factor closely related to the development of atherogenic
   lesions in the rabbit. Dietary CHO and oxidation status of dietary
   lipids significantly impacted lipid metabolism and the development of
   atherosclerosis in rabbits. Oxidized dietary oil accelerated the
   progress of atherosclerotic lesions, but polymerization of oils by
   heating lowered plasma CHO level and the development of atherogenic
   lesions in rabbits. Heating of oil appeared to reduce the absorption of
   CHO in the rabbit. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we analyse whether the consumption based capital asset
   pricing model is consistent with asset return data from the French and
   German stock markets. We evaluate the performance of the C-CAPM by
   applying the non-parametric methodology of Hansen and Jagannathan and
   adopting five alternative specifications of utility. In addition to
   standard power utility we adopt the recursive preferences model proposed
   by Epstein and Zin. We also consider both internal and external habit
   formation (persistence) using the models proposed by Constantinides,
   Abel and Campbell and Cochrane. We evaluate Our findings using the tests
   of Burnside and Hansen and Jagannathan. We find that the majority of
   models produce stochastic discount factors consistent with the data.
   However, high degrees of risk aversion are implied for the models to be
   consistent. Incorporating habit formation only partially reduces the

Abstract = {{The notion that damages should be multiplied by the reciprocal of the
   probability of punishment is one of the basic lessons of the law and
   economics literature. However, the simple ``1/p{''} multiplier turns out
   be inapplicable in the civil damages setting. The multiplier that brings
   about first-best deterrence must be chosen by striking a balance between
   the supply of lawsuits and the need to internalize costs. Moreover,
   given the costs of litigation, a multiplier that minimizes overall
   social costs (in contrast to achieving first-best deterrence) may need
   to be set at a level that effectively bars many claims. This article
   derives optimal damage multipliers for a costly civil litigation system
   and examines the conflicting implications of deterrence and social cost
   minimization as objectives in the design of an optimal multiplier. An
   empirical application suggests that the first-best deterrence multiplier
   for the tort system is roughly equal to two.}},

   included in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and
   Nutrition (EPIC)-Spain cohort. Usual food intake was estimated by
   personal interview through a computerized version of a dietary history
   questionnaire. The estimations of B{[}a]P and total PAHs were made,
   taking into account the country where the determinations of content of
   these compounds in the foods came from and the year of publication. The
   mean intake of B{[}a]P in the population was 0.14 mu g/day, and the mean
   intake of total PAHs was 8.57 mu g/day. Both for B{[}a]P and total PAHs,
   women had a significantly lower mean intake than men, and older people
   consumed lesser amounts than younger people. Furthermore, the intake was
   higher in the northern regions. There were no significant differences by
   smoking status. The food groups of meat and meat products, cereals, and
   oils and fats contribute 55.5\% to the total B{[}a]P intake, while
   cereals and meat and meat products contribute 61\% to the total PAH
   consumption. Our estimations of B{[}a]P intake were lower than in the
   United Kingdom and The Netherlands, were similar to those found in other
   studies from Spain and Italy, and were higher than those in the United
   States and Norway.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to examine the sympathetic-parasympathetic
   interactions on heart rate through release of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and
   its action on prejunctional NPY Y-2 receptors on vagal and sympathetic
   nerve fibers. In other studies on various preparations and in various
   organs, attenuation of transmitter release has in fact been demonstrated
   through activation of the NPY Y-2 receptor. In the present study on
   anesthetized dogs we examine, however, for the first time if vagal
   bradycardia is attenuated by endogenous NPY released during intense
   cardiac sympathetic stimulation. In addition, we explore if sympathetic
   transmitter release and heart rate, during moderate sympathetic
   stimulation, are affected through this receptor system. The significance
   of the NPY Y-2 receptor was revealed by performing experiments before
   and after administration of its specific receptor antagonist BIIE0246.
   We found that attenuation of the bradycardia during vagal nerve
   stimulation was dose-dependently counteracted by BlIE0246 and that the
   tachycardia elicited by sympathetic stimulation remained unaffected
   after NPY Y2 receptor blockade. Thus, endogenous NPY appears to
   attenuate vagal bradycardia by stimulating prejunctional NPY Y-2
   receptors on cardiac vagal nerve terminals and, less efficiently, to
   attenuate transmitter release and tachycardia through a feedback loop on
   the cardiac sympathetic nerve fibers.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the fabrication and characterization of
   optical/electrical printed circuit boards (O/E-PCB) with embedded
   multimodal step index (MM-SI) waveguides and integrated out-of-plane
   micromirrors (IMMs) for three-dimensional (3-D) optical interconnects.
   Optical circuitry is built up on PCBs using UV lithography; 45 degrees
   input/output (I/O) couplers are fabricated by inclined exposure.
   Commercial polymers are used as optical core and cladding materials.
   Critical mirror properties of angle, surface quality, reflectivity, and
   coupling efficiency are characterized experimentally and theoretically.
   Optical and scanning electron microscopy, white light interferometry,
   and fiber scanning method are used in the investigations. Sloping
   profiles measured as a function of the incident light showed the
   attainment of mirror angles of alpha = 36 degrees-45 degrees with +/- 2
   degrees consistency. Near-field optical imaging with a white light
   source showed that out-of-plane beam turning was achieved. Topography
   investigations revealed a rectilinear negative tapering shape regardless
   of the incoming beam angle or type of substrate. However, higher
   substrate reflectancy was observed to lower the mirror angle. The
   average propagation loss' measured for 10-cm-long waveguides at lambda =
   850 nm by the cut-back method was 0.60 dB/cm; the excess loss calculated
   for the mirror coupling was 1.8-2.3 dB. The results showed that the IMMs
   can be incorporated in O/E-PCBs to couple light in and out of planar
   waveguides. Furthermore, the presented results indicate that optical
   waveguides with integrated micromirrors for optical 3-D wiring can be
   produced compatible with volume manufacturing techniques.}},

Abstract = {{We consider negotiations with an open time horizon where a buyer has
   private information about his valuation and does not know whether the
   seller is committed to the advertised price. This setting combines two
   common specifications made in the non-cooperative bargaining literature:
   one side is privately informed about its valuation, which is drawn from
   a continuum, and the other side is possibly committed to a fixed offer.
   We analyze the game both in discrete and in continuous time and show
   convergence the two settings, which extends results from Abreu and Gul
   {[}2000. Bargaining and reputation. Econometrica 68, 85-117]. One
   interesting result is that as time proceeds, the non-committed seller
   becomes less likely to concede in a given period, i.e., it appears as if
   he becomes more ``stubborn.{''} We further show that a seller may prefer
   to negotiate with a ``worse{''} buyer as this enhances the value of his
   possible commitment. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In order to quantitatively investigate the role of leads and sea-ice in
   air-mass modification, aircraft observations were conducted over the
   partially ice-covered Sea of Okhotsk. We investigated two cold-air
   outbreak events with different sea-ice concentrations. In both cases,
   the difference between the temperatures of surface air and the sea
   surface (Delta T) dropped rapidly with the accumulated fetch-width of
   leads up to about 35-40 km, and then decreased very slowly. The surface
   sensible heat flux originating from open water was about 300 W m(-2)
   within a few kilometres from the coast and decreased with increasing
   accumulated fetch-width. The sensible heat flux was about 100 W m(-2)
   stop on average. These results indicate that the downwind air-mass
   modification depends mainly on the total (accumulated) extent of open
   water. The total buoyancy flux (w'T-v') calculated by the joint
   frequency distribution method correlated very well with ice
   concentration. Such a relationship was not clear in the case of the
   moisture flux (w'q'). The ratio between rising thermals (w(+)T(v)(+))
   and cold downdrafts (w(-)T(v)(-)) differed significantly between upwind
   and downwind regions; that is, the buoyancy flux was dominated by
   w(+)T(v)(+) in the developing stage of the boundary layer, while
   w(-)T(v)(-) also became important after the development of the boundary
   layer.}},

Abstract = {{Objective-To evaluate the association between subjective lameness grades
   and kinetic gait parameters and assess the variability in kinetic
   parameters in horses with experimentally induced forelimb lameness.
   Animals-32 horses.
   Procedures-Forelimb lameness was induced in each horse via injection of
   lipopolysaccharide into 1 metacarpophalangeal joint (40 experimental
   trials). Subjective lameness grading and 13 kinetic gait parameters
   (force plate analysis) were assessed before (baseline) and at 12, 18,
   and 24 hours after lipopolysaccharide injection. While horses were
   trotting, kinetic gait analysis was performed for 8 valid repetitions at
   each time point. Repeated-measures analyses were performed with 8
   repetitions for each kinetic parameter as the outcome, and lameness
   grades, time points after lipopolysaccharide injection, and repetition
   order as explanatory variables. Sensitivity and specificity of kinetic
   parameters for classification of horses as sound or lame (in relation to
   subjective lameness scores) were calculated. Between- and within-horse
   variabilities of the 13 kinetic parameters were assessed by calculation
   of coefficients of variation.
   Results-Subjective lameness grades were significantly associated with
   most of the kinetic parameters. Vertical force peak and impulse had the
   lowest between- and within-horse coefficients of variation and the
   highest correlations with subjective lameness grade. Vertical force peak
   had the highest sensitivity and specificity for lameness classification.
   Vertical force peak and impulse were significantly decreased even in
   horses with mild or unobservable lameness.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Among the kinetic gait parameters,
   vertical force peak and impulse had the best potential to reflect
   lameness severity and identify subdinical forelimb gait abnormalities.}},

Abstract = {{The nongenomic effects of aldosterone have been implicated in the
   pathogenesis of various cardiovascular diseases. Aldosterone-induced
   nongenomic effects are attributable in part to the activation of
   extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), a classical
   mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. Big MAP kinase 1 (BMK1), a newly
   identified MAP kinase, has been shown to be involved in cell
   proliferation, differentiation, and survival. We examined whether
   aldosterone stimulates BMK1-mediated proliferation of cultured rat
   aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMCs). Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)
   expression and localization were evaluated by Western blotting analysis
   and fluorolabeling methods. ERK1/2 and BMK1 activities were measured by
   Western blotting analysis with the respective phosphospecific
   antibodies. Cell proliferation was determined by Alamar Blue
   colorimetric assay. Aldosterone (0.1 to 100 nmol/L) dose-dependently
   activated BMK1 in RASMCs, with a peak at 30 minutes. To clarify whether
   aldosterbne-induced BMK1 activation is an MR-mediated phenomenon, we
   examined the effect of eplerenone, a selective MR antagonist, on
   aldosterone-induced BMK1 activation. Eplerenone (0.1 to 10 mu mol/L)
   dose-dependently inhibited aldosterone-induced BMK1 activation in
   RASMCs. Aldosterone also stimulated RASMC proliferation, which was
   inhibited by eplerenone. Aldosterone-mediated phenomena were concluded
   to be attributable to a nongenomic effect because cycloheximide failed
   to inhibit aldosterone-induced BMK1 activation. Transfection of
   dominant-negative MAP kinase/ERK kinase 5 (MEK5), which is an upstream
   regulator of BMK1, partially inhibited aldosterone-induced RASMC
   proliferation, which was almost completely inhibited by MEK inhibitor
   PD98059. In addition to the classical steroid activity, rapid nongenomic
   effects induced by aldosterone may represent an alternative etiology for
   vascular diseases such as hypertension.}},

Abstract = {{Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the selective loss of
   dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN), and it has been
   suggested that dopamine is one of the main endogenous toxins in the
   genesis of PD. We demonstrated that thiol antioxidants (the reduced form
   of glutathione, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, and L-cysteine), which conjugate
   with one dopamine oxidation intermediate, o-quinone, provided almost
   complete protection from dopamine-mediated toxicity in SH-SY5Y, a human
   neuroblastoma cell line. In contrast, catalase partially provided
   protection against cell death caused by dopamine. These data suggest
   that the generation of dopamine oxidation intermediates, rather than
   hydrogen peroxide, plays a pivotal role in dopamine-induced toxicity.
   Iron accumulated in the SN of patients with PD can cause dopaminergic
   neuronal degeneration by enhancing oxidative stress. However, we found
   that iron reduced the total amounts of dopamine oxidation intermediates
   and enhanced the formation of melanin, a final product of dopamine
   oxidation. Also, addition of iron inhibited dopamine-induced
   cytotoxicity. These results suggest that iron can provide protection
   when it accelerates the conversion of dopamine oxidation intermediates.

Abstract = {{The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa secretes a
   capsule-like polysaccharide called alginate that is important for
   evasion of host defenses, especially during chronic pulmonary disease of
   patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Most proteins for alginate
   biosynthesis are encoded by the 12-gene algD operon. Interestingly, this
   operon also encodes AlgL, a lyase that degrades alginate. Mutants
   lacking AlgG, AlgK, or AlgX, also encoded by the operon, synthesize
   alginate polymers that are digested by the coregulated protein AlgL. We
   examined the phenotype of an Delta algL mutation in the highly mucoid CF
   isolate FRD1. Generating a true Delta algL mutant was possible only when
   the algD operon was under the control of a LacI(q) -repressed trc
   promoter. Upon induction of alginate production with
   isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, the Delta algL mutant cells were
   lysed within a few hours. Electron micrographs of the Delta algL mutant
   showed that alginate polymers accumulated in the periplasm, which
   ultimately burst the bacterial cell wall. The requirement of AlgL in an
   alginate-overproducing strain led to a new model for alginate secretion
   in which a multiprotein secretion complex (or scaffold, that includes
   AlgG, AlgK, AlgX, and AlgL) guides new polymers through the periplasm
   for secretion across the outer membrane. In this model, AlgL is
   bifunctional with a structural role in the scaffold and a role in
   degrading free alginate polymers in the periplasm.}},

Abstract = {{Aeroelastic flutter in rotating disks is of interest in a number of
   applications including data storage systems, circular saws and
   microturbines. This paper presents new experimental results on the
   nonlinear aeroelastic flutter phenomena of a flexible disk rotating in
   an unbounded fluid. The experiments are performed on thin steel and
   paper disks over a wide range of rotation speeds in the post-flutter
   region with very fine, computer-controlled increments of the rotation
   speed. The existence of a primary instability of a reflected travelling
   wave of the disk, followed by a secondary instability, is confirmed.
   However, at speeds exceeding that at which the secondary bifurcation
   occurs, complicated, hitherto unrecorded nonlinear response is observed,
   including several solution branches and bifurcation points, frequency
   lockins over certain rotation speed ranges, presence of higher harmonies
   of the unstable wave and large frequency and amplitude hysterisis, as
   the disk speed is ramped up and down across these bifurcations. It is
   shown that a nonlinear von Karman plate model for the disk, coupled with
   a linear aerodynamic load having the form of a rotating damping
   pressure, is capable of capturing the primary instability branch.
   However, such a model is inadequate in capturing the secondary
   bifurcation and the complicated nonlinear response that follows. (c)

   the opposition party. Results suggest that political affiliation
   strongly influences audience reaction in two ways: (a) Republicans

   always rated Kerry's comments higher than Republicans; and (b)
   Republicans believed that Bush won the debate, whereas Democrats
   believed that Kerry won the debate. This research provides new support
   for the conclusion that debates tend to reinforce the preexisting
   positions of the audience but offers a warning that the amount of

   synagogue became an ``Israelite temple{''} and the frame for a reform
   using forms inspired by other worships to impose new behaviours to the
   faithfuls, mostly setting apart spaces devoted to worship and those
   devoted to welfare, and magnifying its cultual function. It is only with
   the adoption of modernist aesthetics that the synagogue, integrated in a
   community center does recover its initial simplicity.}},

Abstract = {{Polyketide synthases ( PKS) perform a stepwise biosynthesis of diverse
   carbon skeletons from simple activated carboxylic acid units. The
   products of the complex pathways possess a wide range of pharmaceutical
   properties, including antibiotic, antitumor, antifungal, and
   immunosuppressive activities. We have performed a comprehensive
   phylogenetic analysis of multimodular and iterative PKS of bacteria and
   fungi and of the distinct types of fatty acid synthases ( FAS) from
   different groups of organisms based on the highly conserved ketoacyl
   synthase ( KS) domains. Apart from enzymes that meet the classification
   standards we have included enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of
   mycolic acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFA), and glycolipids in
   bacteria. This study has revealed that PKS and FAS have passed through a
   long joint evolution process, in which modular PKS have a central
   position. They appear to have derived from bacterial FAS and primary
   iterative PKS and, in addition, share a common ancestor with animal FAS
   and secondary iterative PKS. Furthermore, we have carried out a
   phylogenomic analysis of all modular PKS that are encoded by the
   complete eubacterial genomes currently available in the database. The
   phylogenetic distribution of acyltransferase and KS domain sequences
   revealed that multiple gene duplications, gene losses, as well as
   horizontal gene transfer ( HGT) have contributed to the evolution of PKS
   I in bacteria. The impact of these factors seems to vary considerably
   between the bacterial groups. Whereas in actinobacteria and
   cyanobacteria the majority of PKS I genes may have evolved from a common
   ancestor, several lines of evidence indicate that HGT has strongly
   contributed to the evolution of PKS I in proteobacteria. Discovery of
   new evolutionary links between PKS and FAS and between the different PKS
   pathways in bacteria may help us in understanding the selective
   advantage that has led to the evolution of multiple secondary metabolite
   biosyntheses within individual bacteria.}},

Abstract = {{We detail the sizes, spatial distributions and trends in nest site
   selection of cliff-nesting raptor and raven populations resident in the
   mountains of the Cape Peninsula, South Africa. We also assess the
   conservation value of these populations to inform the future management
   of the newly-established Table Mountain National Park (TMNP), and
   examine the structure and interrelations within the raptor community.
   The combined number, dispersion and density of nests (n = 96 nests, mean
   inter-nest distance = 0.59km, density = 30.0 pairs/100km(2)) are
   comparable with those of high-density raptor populations studied
   elsewhere in Africa and the world. Densities of Verreauxs' Eagle Aquila
   verreauxii (n = 2, 12.01 km, 0.6 pairs/100km(2), respectively) and
   Jackal Buzzard Buteo rufofuscus (n = 9, 4.63, 2.8 pairs/100km(2)), are
   low, Rock Kestrel Falco rupicolus (n = 44, 1.75km, 13.8 pairs/100km(2))
   high and Peregrine Falcon Falco peregrinus (n = 19, 3.13km, 5.9
   pairs/100km(2)) exceptional, relative to populations of the same or
   similar species in other areas. There are no comparable data for
   White-necked Raven Corvus albicollis (n = 22, 3.22km, 6.9
   pairs/100km(2)). All species combined, and Peregrines in particular,
   significantly prefer high cliffs from the available habitat. Peregrines
   generally dominate the other species, may affect cliff site selection
   and dispersion in the rest of the community, and tend to locate their
   nests close to those of White-necked Ravens. Numbers of Verreauxs' Eagle
   are lower than recent historical levels, perhaps because key prey
   populations are depleted. Any future recovery of this large predator
   could subtly affect the entire assemblage. This cliff-nesting raptor
   community is a significant asset of the TMNP, and should be considered
   in management decisions taken in the Park, particularly those concerning
   the regulation of leisure activities in the vicinity of nesting areas.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the protostrongylid nematode Parelaphostrongylus odocoilei has
   been reported in a new host species, thinhorn sheep (Ovis dalli). For
   the first time, we completed the life cycle of P. odocoilei in three
   Stone's sheep (O. dalli stonei) and two thinhorn hybrids (O. dalli
   stonei X O. dalli dalli), each infected with 200 third-stage larvae from
   slugs (Deroceras laeve). The prepatent period ranged from 68 days to 74
   days, and shedding of first-stage larvae (L1) peaked at > 10,000 L1 per
   gram of feces between 90 and 110 days postinfection. A total of 75, 27,
   and 14 adult P odocoilei were recovered from skeletal muscles of three
   Stone's sheep. Starting in the prepatent period, all infected sheep lost
   weight and developed peripheral eosinophilia. At 2 wk before patency,
   two thinhorn hybrids developed neurologic signs (hind end ataxia, loss
   of conscious proprioception, and hyperesthesia) that resolved at
   patency. Eosinophilic pleocytosis and antibody to Parelaphostrongylus
   spp. were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of the affected sheep,
   suggesting that the migration route of the ``muscle worth{''} P
   odocoilei may involve the central nervous system. Twenty days after
   treatment with ivermectin, neurologic signs recurred and larval shedding
   ceased in one infected thinhorn hybrid, whereas Multiple treatments
   transiently suppressed but did not eliminate larval shedding in the
   other. During patency, two Stone's sheep with numerous eggs and larvae
   of P. odocoilei in the lungs died of respiratory failure following
   anesthesia or exertion. Parelaphostrongylus odocoilei has widespread
   geographic distribution, high prevalence, the possibility of causing
   neurologic and respiratory disease, resistance to treatment, and may
   constitute a significant emerging disease risk for thinhorn sheep.}},

Journal = {{PAIN}},

Volume = {{117}},

Abstract = {{The contribution of estrogen and progesterone to colorectal hyperalgesia
   was examined in female rats. The electromyogram recorded from the
   abdominal wall (visceromotor response, vmr) and the discharge of
   lumbosacral dorsal horn neurons to colorectal distention (CRD) were
   measured in intact female, ovariectomized (OVx) and estradiol replaced
   OVx (E2; 50 mu g, 48 h) rats with and without colonic inflammation.
   Colorectal hyperalgesia was transient in intact rats, but persisted at
   least 4 h in E2 and OVx rats. The magnitude of hyperalgesia in E2 rats
   was greater than OVx which was greater than intact rats. Dorsal horn
   neurons that responded to CRD with an Abrupt (on and off with stimulus)
   excitatory discharge showed similar sensitivity to estradiol as the vmr
   following colonic inflammation. In contrast, inflammation did not
   increase the magnitude of response of excitatory neurons with sustained
   afterdischarges in any of the treatment groups. Intact female rats have
   a comparable plasma estrogen concentration to E2 rats, suggesting the
   difference in responses may have been due to antinociceptive effects of
   progesterone. This was tested by administering E2 +/- progesterone (I
   mg) and measuring the vmr. Progesterone reduced the facilitation of the
   vmr produced by E2 before and following colonic inflammation. The
   present study suggests that estrogen replacement enhances visceral
   signal processing following colonic inflammation. Furthermore,
   progesterone may counteract the effects of estrogen on colorectal
   sensitivity. (c) 2005 International Association for the Study of Pain.

   UV-B treated samples were, respectively, 52\%, 87\%, and 93\% of
   controls on days 4, 7, and 10 of growth. The light-saturated
   photosynthetic rates at day 6 were significantly lower than controls
   grown without UV-B. The probability of electron transfer beyond Q(A)
   decreased during UV-B exposure, and this indicated that the acceptor
   side of PSII was one of main damage sites. The adaptation of M.
   aeruginosa 854 to UV-B radiation could be observed from light-saturated
   photosynthetic rates on day 13 and diurnal changes of chl fluorescence
   during the late growth phase. When both exposed to higher UV-B, samples
   cultured under 1.05 W.m(-2) UV-B for 9 days recovered faster than
   controls. It is suggested that M. aeruginosa 854 had at least three
   adaptive strategies to cope with the enhanced UV-B: increasing the
   synthesis of carotenoids to counteract reactive oxidants caused by UV-B
   exposure, degrading phycocyanin and allophycocyanin to avoid further
   damage to DNA and reaction centers, and enhancing the repair of UV-B
   induced damage to the photosynthetic apparatus.}},

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{90}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the robustness of the four proportional intensity
   (PI) models: Prentice-Williams-Peterson-gap time (PWP-GT), PWP-total
   time (PWP-TT), Andersen-Gill (AG), and Wei-Lin-Weissfeld (WLW), for
   right-censored recurrent failure event data. The results are beneficial
   to practitioners in anticipating the more favorable engineering
   application domains and selecting appropriate PI models. The PWP-GT and
   AG prove to be models of choice over ranges of sample sizes, shape
   parameters, and censoring severity. At the smaller sample size (U = 60),
   where there are 30 per class for a two-level covariate, the PWP-GT
   proves to perform well for moderate right-censoring (P-c <= 0.8), where
   80\% of the units have some censoring, and moderately decreasing,
   constant, and moderately increasing rates of occurrence of failures
   (power-law NHPP shape parameter in the range of 0.8 <= delta <= 1.8).
   For the large sample size (U = 180), the PWP-GT performs well for severe
   right-censoring (0.8 <P-c <= 1.0), where 100\% of the units have some
   censoring, and moderately decreasing, constant, and moderately
   increasing rates of occurrence of failures (power-law NHPP shape
   parameter in the range of 0.8 <= delta <= 2.0). The AG model proves to
   outperform the PWP-TT and WLW for stationary processes (HPP) across a
   wide range of right-censorship (0.0 <= P-c <= 1.0) and for sample sizes
   of 60 or more. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Wild rice (Zizania palustris) is a newly cultivated crop that is known
   for its quality compounds of human health benefits. Zizania seeds are
   extremely sensitive to drought during the maturing and storage period.
   This study was conducted to examine the effect of seed water content on
   germination in three Zizania species, Z. aquatica, Z. latifolia and Z.
   palustris that have different morphological grain characteristics. Grain
   water content in the range-of 9 to 83\% showed a positive correlation
   with germination rate and speed. It was greatly affected by humidity
   during seed desiccation period. Seed water content was higher. in the
   varieties or strains of larger grains than in those of smaller grains,
   also, in unhulled than in hulled grains. Seed water content decreased
   rapidly within 2 weeks of desiccation. Decreased seed water content was
   closely related to the decreased germination rate and speed in most
   Zizania species. Seed germination rate was maintained over 80\% in water
   content over 35\% in all Zizania species except for Z. latifolia from
   Sunchon bay that showed very low germination. However, seed germination
   at water content below 35\% was significantly different by the seed size
   but not necessarily by the species. Seed viability of 50\% was observed
   at 20\% of seed water content in the small grain Z. aquatica from
   Virginia, while at about 10-13\% of water contents in the large grain Z.
   aquatica from Iowa and Z. palustris. Taken together, the results from
   this study indicate that water content of mature wild rice seeds is a
   critical factor in germination, and it is affected mainly by humidity
   during seed maturation. Post-harvest practices to maintain seed water
   content in the range of 20 to 50\% should improve wild rice seed
   viability.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the analysis of a panel of variable (V) region sequences from
   the Australian duck-billed platypus and the Australian short beaked
   echidna, the monotremes were found to express a highly diversified V
   lambda repertoire. High variability was observed both in sequence and in
   length of all three CDR regions. However, all monotreme sequences were
   found to form a separate branch on a distance tree, and the monotremes
   appear to express only two V lambda gene families. The appearance of all
   V lambda gene segments in one branch on the distance tree gives further
   support for the notion that deletions of entire V region clans or
   families, followed by successive rounds of gene duplications may be a
   relatively common phenomenon during vertebrate evolution. Four different
   constant region sequences were also identified and a preferential use of
   certain J segments to each constant region was observed. A more detailed
   picture of the locus was obtained by analysis of genomic DNA by Southern
   blot and PCR. The organization of the lambda locus involves multiple V
   and several constant region genes with one or several joining segments
   positioned upstream of each constant region, similar to the organization
   in mouse and man. An mRNA frequency analysis shows that the lambda light
   chain accounts for more than 90\% of the light chain transcripts in the
   spleen. The abundance and the high variability indicate that light chain
   diversity at the lambda locus contributes significantly to the
   antigen-binding repertoire in monotremes. A high lambda to kappa light
   chain ratio also indicates that variability in the CDR regions is more
   important for the repertoire size than the total number of V gene
   families.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of mulch and scarification on the establishment and growth
   of six clones of Norway spruce {[} Picea abies ( L.) Karst.] were
   examined in a study in southern Sweden. Mulch and scarification reduced
   the amount of competing vegetation and tended to improve soil moisture
   and soil temperature. Budbreak occurred earlier for cuttings planted in
   the scarification treatment in comparison with the control and mulching
   treatment. Scarification increased survival and the combination of
   scarification and mulch resulted in the best growth. Gas exchange and
   the number of new roots were higher in planting spots covered with
   mulch. Clonal differences regarding gas exchange and growth were
   significant. Clones with a poor height growth also had a low gas
   exchange and a small number of new roots. In contrast, the clone with
   the best height growth had high gas exchange and a large number of new
   roots. Clonal effects on growth were greater than site preparation
   effects.}},

Abstract = {{Male reproductive success in higher plants depends largely on the fates
   of pollen, but current methodologies have given only partial insights
   into this important aspect of plant mating. We present a detailed
   analysis of the proportions and absolute amounts of stained pollen
   involved in six key fates for the hawkmoth-pollinated African orchid
   Disa cooperi. Despite being packaged into pollinaria, high proportions
   (> 0.95) of the pollen removed from anthers were lost during transport
   by hawkmoths in both years. The proportion of pollen lost correlated
   positively with the number of pollinaria removed from a plant, so that
   pollen export did not vary with pollen removal. Most pollen was
   dispersed to neighbouring plants, with rare long-distance dispersal up
   to 65 m. Of the pollen that reached stigmas during both years, roughly
   equal amounts were involved in facilitated self-pollination vs.
   cross-pollination, but the relative proportions of these fates differed
   between years. Contrary to expectation, we found that self-pollination
   between flowers did not increase with the number of open flowers, even
   though moths probed significantly more flowers on larger plants.
   However, during both years the fraction of removed pollen exported to
   other plants declined significantly with increasing self-pollination on
   the source plant, indicating that once self-pollination occurred it
   reduced (discounted) subsequent pollen export opportunities. The
   packaging of pollen into pollinaria in orchids appears to increase
   overall transfer efficiency by at least an order of magnitude relative
   to plants with granular pollen. Nevertheless, considerable uncertainties
   remain in the male reproductive success of individual orchids. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Excessive mortality from spawning through the first year of life is
   likely responsible for recruitment failures in many lake trout
   (Salvelinus namaycush) populations. We evaluated relationships between
   interstitial predator species and lake trout egg deposition in three
   regions of the Great Lakes. The introduced crayfish Orconectes rusticus
   dominated the nearshore zone in northern Lake Michigan, whereas other
   sites in Lake Michigan and Parry Sound were dominated by native
   Orconectes propinquus. In Lake Champlain, sculpin (Cottus spp.) were the
   most common interstitial predator, yet densities were comparable with
   those in Lake Michigan. Predator densities in Lake Michigan (mean +/-
   standard error = 15.5 +/- 0.4 predators center dot m(-2)) were twice
   those in Lake Champlain or Parry Sound (6 +/- 1 predators center dot
   m(-2)). Densities of eggs were higher in Lake Champlain (2994.1 +/-
   398.3 eggs center dot m(-2)) and Parry Sound (454.7 +/- 36.3) than in
   Lake Michigan (7.5 +/- 1.3; Kruskal-Wallis, P <= 0.05). Ratios of eggs
   to predator provide simple measures of the effectiveness of lake trout
   rehabilitation efforts. The average ratio calculated from 10 successful
   spawning locations is 190 eggs center dot predator(-1 center dot)m(-2).
   Ratios may help establish target egg densities for restoration efforts
   and the concentration of spawning adults required to allow survival to
   the fry stage.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Chronic anal fissure is associated with considerable pain
   and anal hypertonia. Numerous clinical studies attest to the
   effectiveness of individual nitro-containing drugs and organic calcium
   channel blockers in this condition but there are few comparative
   studies.
   Methods: Isolated segments of sheep internal anal sphincter were
   prepared for isometric tension recording. The effect of various drugs on
   myogenic tone was examined in the absence or presence of sodium
   orthovanadate (SOV), an agent used to mimic anal hypertonia by
   increasing myogenic tone.
   Results: All the drugs tested produced concentration-dependent
   inhibition of myogenic tone, with the maximum effect ranging from 66.4
   per cent (verapamil) to 100 per cent (sodium nitroprusside). Sodium
   nitroprusside and diltiazem were the most potent, followed by glyceryl
   trinitrate (GTN), nifedipine and verapamil, which had similar potency,
   and finally nicorandil. The potency of GTN and diltiazem was reduced
   threefold in the presence of 1 mmol/l SOV. The combined effect of GTN
   and diltiazem was greater than the effect of either agent alone, even in
   the presence of 3 mmol/l SOV.
   Conclusion: Nitro- containing drugs and organic calcium channel blockers
   are potent inhibitors of anal sphincter myogenic tone that may be used
   in combination to treat chronic anal fissure.}},

Abstract = {{Tracheid coarseness, specific surface, wall thickness, perimeter, and
   radial and tangential diameter from 119 radial strips of Pinus taeda L.
   (loblolly pine) trees grown on 14 sites in three physiographic regions
   of Georgia (USA) were measured by SilviScan. NIR spectra were also
   collected in 10 mm increments from the radial longitudinal surface of
   each strip and split into calibration (9 sites, 729 spectra) and
   prediction sets (6 sites, 225 spectra). NIR spectra (untreated and
   mathematically treated first and second derivative and multiplicative
   scatter correction) were correlated with tracheid properties to develop
   calibrations for the estimation of these properties. Strong correlations
   were obtained for properties related to density, the strongest R-2 being
   0.80 (coarseness), 0.78 (specific surface) and 0.84 (wall thickness).
   When applied to the test set, good relationships were obtained for the
   density-related properties (R (2)(p) ranged from 0.68 to 0.86), but the
   accuracy of predictions varied depending on math treatment. The addition
   of a small number of cores from the prediction set (one core per new
   site) to the calibration set improved the accuracy of predictions and,
   importantly, minimized the differences obtained with the various math
   treatments. These results suggest that density related properties can be
   estimated by NIR with sufficient accuracy to be used in operational

   Design. Comparative study on two techniques for ankle pressure
   measurement.
   Setting. University hospital.
   Material. Thirty-five patients with leg arterial disease and eight
   healthy volunteers. Ankle-brachial indices (ABPI) were measured using
   conventional CW Doppler technique and PPG-based prototype equipment for
   the ankle pressure recordings.
   Chief outcome measures. ABPIs calculated from CW Doppler anti PPG ankle
   pressure measurements. The PPG signals were analysed both by visual
   judgement anti by a software based, automatic algorithm.
   Main results. The mean difference between ABPIs calculated from CW
   Doppler recordings and PPG (visual analysis) was -0.01 (limits of
   agreement (+/- two standard deviations) +0.16 to -0.19). The correlation
   coefficient was 0.93. When the algorithin was used, the mean difference
   (CW Doppler-PPG) was 0.05 (limits of agreement 0.28 to -0.18, r = 0.89).
   Conclusions. The PPG method is a promising technique with an inherent
   potential for automatisation of the ankle pressure measurements, thereby
   reducing the observer-dependency in ABPI recordings.}},

Abstract = {{During 7 consecutive days, blood and several tissues were collected
   during daytime working hours only, three times per day at 4-h intervals
   from inbred Wistar rats, which had been previously standardized for I
   month in two rooms on a regimen of 12 In of light (L) alternating with
   12 It of darkness (LD12:12). In one room, lights were on from 09:00 to
   211:00 and in the other room, lights were on from 2 1:00 to 09:00 (DL
   12:12; reversed lighting regimen). This setup provides a convenient
   design to study circadian and extracircadian variations over long (e.g.
   7-day) spans. Prior checking of certain circadian rhythms in animals
   reared in the room on reversed lighting (DL) as compared with animals in
   the usual (LD) regimen provided evidence that die 180 degrees
   phase-shift had occurred. These measurements were limited to the
   circadian (and not extended to infradian) variation. As marker rhythm,
   the core temperature of a subsample of rats was measured every 4 It
   around the clock (by night as well as by day) before the start of the
   7-day sampling. An antiphase of the circadian rhythm in core temperature
   was thus demonstrated between rats in the LD vs. DL rooms. A sex
   difference in core temperature was also found in each room. A reversed
   rhythm in animals kept in DL and an antiphase between rats kept in DL
   vs. LD was again shown for the circulating corticosterone rhythm
   documented in subsamples of 8 animals of each sex sampled around the
   clock during the first similar to 1.5 day of the 7-day sampling. The
   findings were in keeping with the proposition that sampling rats at
   three timepoints 4 h apart during daytime from two rooms on opposite
   lighting regimens allows the assessment of circadian changes, the
   daytime samples from animals kept on the reversed lighting regimen
   accounting for the samples that would have to be obtained by night from
   animals kept in the room with the usual lighting regimen. During the
   7-day-long follow-up, circadian and extracircadian spectral components
   were mapped for serum corticosterone, taking into account the large
   day-to-day variability. A third check on the synchronization of the
   animals to their respective lighting regimen was a comparison (and a
   good agreement) between studies carried out earlier on the same
   variables and the circadian results obtained on core temperature and
   serum corticosterone in this study as a whole. The present study
   happened to start on the day of the second extremum of a moderate double
   magnetic storm. The study of any associations of corticosterone with the
   storm is beyond our scope herein, as are the results on circulating
   prolactin, characterized by a greater variability and a larger sex
   difference than corticosterone. Sex differences and extracircadian
   aspects of prolactin and endothelin determined in the same samples are
   reported elsewhere, as are results on melatonin. Prior studies on
   melatonin were confirmed insofar as a circadian profile is concerned by
   sampling on two antiphasic lighting regimens, as also reported
   elsewhere. Accordingly, a circadian map for the rat will eventually be
   extended by the result of this study and aligned with other maps with
   the qualification of the unassessed contribution in this study of a
   magnetic storm. (c) 2005 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To solve the problems of islet engraftment, we investigated the effects
   of insulin sensitizers, metformin and rosiglitazone, on the in vitro and
   in vivo function of mouse islets. The in vitro study was done by
   culturing 30 isolated C5713L/6 mouse islets with glucose (100 or 300
   mg/dL) or rosiglitazone (4.5 mu mol/L) for 2, 4, 8, or 12 hours. The in
   vivo study was performed by syngeneically transplanting 150 C57BL/6
   mouse islets under the kidney capsule of streptozotocin-diabetic mice.
   The metformin group was treated with 200 mg/kg/d in water and the
   control group was pair-fed the same volume of liquid diet. In the in
   vitro study, insulin release stimulated by 300 mg/dL glucose (n = 6) was
   the highest at all time points. That stimulated by rosiglitazone (n = 6)
   was greater than by 100 mg/dL glucose (n = 6) only at 8 hours. In the
   recipients treated with metformin (n = 17) and controls (n = 13), the
   blood glucose decreased and body weight increased gradually after
   transplantation. However, there was no significant difference between
   the two groups. Their tolerance to intraperitoneal glucose challenge at
   2 and 4 weeks was also comparable. At 4 weeks, 12/17 (71\%) in the
   metformin group and 8/13 (62\%) in the control group achieved
   normoglycemia (P = .60). At 4 weeks, the insulin content of the graft
   was 8.35 +/- 3.42 mg in the metformin group and 5.28 +/- 4.28 mg in the
   control group (P = .59). Our data indicate that (1) rosiglitazone
   stimulated isolated islets to release insulin but was less effective
   than high levels of glucose; and (2) metformin treatment had no
   beneficial effect on islet recipients.}},

Abstract = {{Various effects of annealing on the optical and structural properties of
   sputtered ZnO layers have been investigated. ZnO layers were sputtered
   on Si (111) substrates and annealed at 700-900 degrees C under H2O
   atmosphere. Optical and structural properties along with surface
   morphologies were estimated by using photoluminescence (PL), X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), and atomic force microscopy (AFM), respectively.
   Improvement of crystal quality was observed up to 800 degrees C,
   however, it deteriorated at higher annealing temperature due to the
   enhanced interdiffusion of ZnO layer and Si substrate. Transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) were
   used to characterize the microstructure of ZnO layers. An amorphous
   interfacial layer is found owing to strong interdiffusion at the
   interface, and the reduction of the layer thickness as a result of
   interdiffusion is observed, which is responsible for the degradation of
   ZnO layer. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Inappropriate use of antimicrobials to treat acute upper
   respiratory tract infections (URIs), which usually have a viral
   etiology, contributes to emergence and spread of antimicrobial
   resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae and other human bacterial
   pathogens.
   OBJECTIVE: To reduce antimicrobial use for management of acute URIs in
   adult and pediatric patients.
   DESIGN: Prospective, nonrandomized, controlled trial.
   SETTING: Four primary care clinics within a staff model HMO in Detroit,
   Mich.
   PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-one primary care physicians at clinics where the
   educational intervention was implemented, and 9 primary care physicians
   at control clinics where no educational programs were implemented.
   MEASUREMENTS: Antibiotic prescribing for acute URIs during the baseline
   and study years among the intervention and control groups.
   RESULTS: A generalized linear mixed-effects model was used and showed
   that antimicrobial prescribing among the intervention group physicians
   decreased 24.6\% from the baseline to the postintervention period (P
   <.0001) for both pediatric and adult medicine physicians. From the
   baseline to the study period, there was no significant decline in rates
   of antimicrobial prescribing by the control group of physicians
   (pediatricians, P=.35; internists, P=.42). The rates of decline in
   antimicrobial prescribing differed significantly between the
   intervention and control groups (P <.0003 for pediatricians and P <.01
   for Internists).
   CONCLUSIONS: An interactive, case-based educational program for
   physicians and their staff proved effective for reducing unwarranted
   prescribing of antibiotics in the treatment of URIs by primary care
   physicians in a Medicaid HMO setting.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical circulatory support is successfully applied to patients with

   consecutive patients with the MEDOS is reported. Perioperative survival
   was 84.6\%, complications occurred in 61\% (31\% thrombembolism, 23\%
   rethoracotomy, 7\% infections). Mean duration of support was 17.6 +/-
   14.6 days (1-45 days). Bilirubin decreased from 3.9 +/- 2.3 to 2.7 +/-
   1.6 mg/dL; creatinine from 1.6 +/- 1 to 1.4 +/- 0.8 mg/dL; lactate from
   5.8 +/- 4.2 to 1.7 +/- 1.5 (P = 0.027; Wilcoxon). All patients who
   underwent subsequent heart transplantation (6 of 13; 46\%) were
   discharged from hospital. For 38.5\% of the patients no organ offer was
   received. Mechanical circulatory support with the MEDOS/HIASystem can be
   performed successfully for bridging to transplantation. Secondary organ
   functions improve under this pulsatile circulatory assistance.

Abstract = {{The present study describes several features of the aquatic environment
   with the emphasis on the total vs. filter-passing fraction (FP) of heavy
   metals in microhabitats of two typical deep-sea vent organisms: the
   filter-feeder, symbiont-bearing Bathymodiolus and the grazer shrimps
   Rimicaris/Mirocaris from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). The concentration
   of 10 trace elements: Al, Mn, Co, Cu, Mo, Cd, Fe, Zn, Pb and Hg was
   explored highlighting common and distinctive features among the five
   hydrothermal vent sites of the MAR: Menez Gwen, Lucky Strike, Rainbow,
   Saldanha, and Menez Hom that are all geo-chemically different when
   looking at the undiluted hydrothermal fluid composition. The drop off in
   the percentage of FP from total metal concentration in mussel and/or
   shrimp inhabited water samples (in mussel beds at Rainbow, for instance,
   FP fraction of Fe was below 23\%, Zn 24\%, Al 65\%, Cu 70\%, and Mn
   89\%) as compared to non-inhabited areas (where 94\% of the Fe, 90\% of
   the Zn, 100\% of the other metals was in the FP fraction) may indicate
   an influence of vent organisms on their habitat's chemistry, which in
   turn may determine adaptational strategies to elevated levels of toxic
   heavy metals. Predominance of particulate fraction over the soluble
   metals, jointly with the morphological structure and elemental
   composition of typical particles in these vent habitats suggest a more
   limited metal bioavailability to vent organisms as previously thought.
   In addition, it is evoked that vent invertebrates may have developed
   highly efficient metal-handling strategies targeting particulate phase
   of various metals present in the mixing zones that enables their
   survival under these extreme conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Bcl-2 family members have long been known to control permeabilization of
   the mitochondrial membrane during apoptosis, but involvement of these
   proteins in lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) was not considered
   until recently. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism
   underlying the release of lysosomal proteases to the cytosol seen during
   apoptosis, with special emphasis on the role of Bax. In human
   fibroblasts, exposed to the apoptosis-inducing drug staurosporine (STS),
   the release of the lysosomal protease cathepsin D to the cytosol was
   observed by immunocytochemistry. In response to STS treatment, there was
   a shift in Bax immunostaining from a diffuse to a punctate pattern.
   Confocal microscopy showed co-localization of Bax with both lysosomes
   and mitochondria in dying cells. Presence of Bax at the lysosomal
   membrane was confirmed by immuno-electron microscopy. Furthermore, when
   recombinant Bax was incubated with pure lysosomal fractions, Bax
   inserted into the lysosomal membrane and induced the release of
   lysosomal enzymes. Thus, we suggest that Bax is a mediator of LMP,
   possibly promoting the release of lysosomal enzymes to the cytosol
   during apoptosis.}},

Title = {{Cyclosporine markedly raises the plasma concentrations of repaglinide}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY \& THERAPEUTICS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{78}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{388-399}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background and Objective: Repaglinide is an antidiabetic drug
   metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 and 3A4, and it appears to be a
   substrate of the hepatic uptake transporter organic anion transporting
   polypeptide 1B1 (OAMP1B1). We studied the effects of cyclosporine (INN,
   ciclosporin), an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and OATP1B1, on the
   pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of repaglinide.
   Methods. In a randomized crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers took 100
   mg cyclosporine or placebo orally a t 8 Pm on day 1 and at 8 Am on day
   2. At 9 Am on day 2, they ingested a single 0.25-mg dose of repaglinide.
   Concentrations of plasma and urine repaglinide and its metabolites (M),
   blood cyclosporine, and blood glucose were measured for 12 hours. The
   subjects were genotyped for single-nucleotide polymorphisms in C gamma
   P2C8, CYP3A5, SLCO1B1 (encoding OATP1B1), and ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein).
   The effect of cyclosporine on repaglinide metabolism was studied in
   human liver microsomes in vitro.
   Results. During the cyclosporine phase, the mean peak repaglinide plasma
   concentration was 175\% (range, 56\%-365\%; P =.013) and the total area
   under the plasma concentration-time curve {[}AUC(0-infinity)] was 244\%
   (range, 119\%7533\%; P < .001) of that in the placebo phase. The amount
   of unchanged repaglinide and its metabolites M2 and M4 excreted in urine
   were raised 2.7-fold, 7.5-fold, and 5.0-fold, respectively, by
   cyclosporine (P <.001). The amount of M1 excreted in urine remained
   unchanged, but cyclosporine reduced the ratio of M1 to repaglinide by
   62\% (P <.001). Cyclosporine had no significant effect on the
   elimination half-life or renal clearance of repaglinide. Although the
   mean blood glucose-lowering effect of repaglinide was unaffected in this
   low-dose study with frequent carbohydrate intake, the subject with the
   greatest pharmacokinetic interaction had the greatest increase in blood
   glucose-lowering effect. The effect of cyclosporine on repaglinide
   AUC((0-infinity)) was 42\% lower in subjects with the SLCO1B1 521TC
   genotype than in subjects with the 521TT (reference) genotype (P =.047).
   In vitro, cyclosporine inhibited the formation of M1 (IC50
   {[}concentration of inhibitor to cause 50\% inhibition of original
   enzyme activity], 0.2 mu mol/L) and M2 (IC50, 4.3 mu mol/L) but had no
   effect on M4.
   Conclusions. Cyclosporine raised the plasma concentrations of
   repaglinide, probably by inhibiting its CYP3A4-catalyzed
   biotransformation and OATP1B1 I -mediated hepatic uptake.
   Coadministration of cyclosporine may enhance the blood glucose-lowering
   effect of repaglinide and increase the risk of hypoglycemia.}},

Abstract = {{We report on c-axis charge dynamics in P cuprate superconductors which
   have two kinds of block layers, rocksalt and fluorite. Multilayer effect
   has already been obvious by optical measurements that two longitudinal
   Josephson plasma modes and a transverse optical one appear below T-c in
   SmLa1-xSrxCuO4-delta (SLSCO) by forming Josephson superlattice as
   S/I-1/S/I-2/S along c-axis. The phenomenon can be explained as also
   charging effect on CuO2 plane and is seen also in bilayer cuprates such
   as YBCO and BISCCO. Here we discuss the universality on penetration
   depth lambda(c) against dc c-axis conductivity sigma(c). In general,
   lambda(c) is determined by a longitudinal Josephson plasma mode omega(p)
   as lambda(c) = 1/27 pi omega(p) in case of single junction. It is
   well-known that the penetration depth determined by the Josephson plasma
   is almost scaled with sigma(c) in high-T-c cuprates. We show that the
   universality is valid for even T{*} cuprates which has two different
   Josephson junctions and discuss an intimate correlation among lambda(c),
   anisotropy and charging effect. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   of constitution is a recent and sophisticated version of the standard
   account. She argues that the aforementioned objection can be answered by
   defining a relation of being the same P as (sameP). In this paper I
   shall examine consequences of her response and show that sameP has wrong
   formal properties, as a result of which this solution cannot be

   They are obtained in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions.
   Low-penalty DPA of a 10-Gb/s nonreturn-to-zero (NRZ) signal over a 75-km
   dispersion-shifted fiber (DSF), is demonstrated by using only 66.5 mW of
   pump power. Three adjacent channels have been simultaneously
   transmitted, with little penalty due to nonlinear crosstalk. It is
   experimentally verified that DPA requires less pump power than
   distributed Raman amplification (DRA), for similar power penalties.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To quantify tumor perfusion after transcatheter arterial
   embolization (TAE) with functional computed tomography (CT) and to
   validate the reproducibility of quantification measurements.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted in accordance with an
   institutional animal care and use committee-approved protocol. Sixteen
   rats with liver tumors underwent TAE with 1 mg (group 1) or 3 mg (group
   2) of polyvinyl alcohol particles. In each group, four rats underwent
   functional CT immediately after TAE (day 0) and four others underwent
   functional CT 2 days after TAE (day 2). Another four rats served as
   control rats. Blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), mean transit time
   (IVITT), and permeability-surface area product were measured by using a
   functional CT software program. For evaluation of reproducibility, six
   additional rats with mammary tumors underwent functional CT twice, with
   examinations 2 hours apart. The mixed-effect model was used to assess
   the TAE treatment effect, and the Pearson correlation test was used to
   determine measurement reproducibility.
   RESULTS: With the exception of BF in group 1 on day 2 (P =.41), BF and
   BV values in both groups on both days were significantly lower than BF
   and BV values in the control rats (with P values ranging from .018 to
   <.001). BF was significantly lower in group 2 than in group 1 on days 0
   and 2 (P =.043 and P =.02, respectively). BV was significantly lower on
   day 2 than on day 0 in group 2 (P =.016). IVITT was generally inversely
   related to BF. MTTs in group 2 on days 0 and 2 were significantly longer
   than those in the control rats (P <.001 and P =.03, respectively), and
   MTT was shorter on day 2 than on day 0 in group 2 (P =.02).
   Permeability-surface area product changes were similar to BF changes.
   There were no significant differences (P values ranged from .2 to .5)
   between perfusion parameters in the reproducibility study.
   CONCLUSION: The results of this study validate the use of functional CT
   in the quantification of tumor perfusion after TAE and the
   reproducibility of such quantification measurements. (c) RSNA, 2005.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The etiology of early-onset diarrhea of neonates and small
   infants that persists despite bowel rest is heterogeneous. Two different
   categories of disorders presenting with diarrhea in the first weeks of
   life can be distinguished: constitutive intestinal epithelial disorders
   (microvillus atrophy {[}MVA] or epithelial dysplasia {[}ED]) and
   immune-inflammatory disorders, (autoimmune enteropathy {[}AIE] or
   inflammatory colitis {[}IC]). We aimed to evaluate in a prospective
   manner the use of fecal inflammatory markers in the differential
   diagnosis of severe persistent diarrhea.
   Material and Patients: Twenty-five patients (17 males) were enrolled in
   this study (median age 8 months). Fourteen children had a constitutive
   enterocyte disorder (group 1: MVA = 8, ED = 6), and 11patients had an
   immuno-inflammatory disease (group 2: AIE = 5, IC = 6). Stool samples
   were collected at the time of diagnosis and stored at - 80 degrees until
   tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and calprotectin were measured by
   enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay.
   Results: No significant differences in age at onset of diarrhea or in
   stool volumes were observed between both groups. In group 1, fecal
   TNF-alpha was undetectable/normal in 14 of 14 children, whereas group 2
   showed dramatically elevated TNF-alpha levels (mean 3,104, range
   237-18,078 pg/g) in 8 of 11 patients. Similarly, calprotectin levels
   were undetectable/normal in 14 of 14 patients in group 1 and highly
   raised in 11 of 11 patients in group 2 (median 1, 145, range 375-3,095
   mu g/g), P < 0.01. Under therapy, these inflammatory parameters
   normalized.
   Conclusions: Determination of fecal inflammatory markers is a simple
   method helping to distinguish constitutive from immuno-inflammatory
   etiologies of severe persistent diarrhea. These data also suggest that
   constitutive enterocyte disorders are not accompanied by an inflammatory
   mucosal reaction.}},

Abstract = {{Concern over the impact of invaders on biodiversity and on the
   functioning of ecosystems has generated a rising tide of comparative
   analyses aiming to unveil the factors that shape the success of
   introduced species across different regions. One limitation of these
   studies is that they often compare geographically rather than
   ecologically defined regions We propose an approach that can help
   address this limitation: comparison of invasions across convergent
   ecosystems that share similar climates. We compared avian invasions in
   five convergent mediterranean climate systems around,the globe. Based on
   a database of 180 introductions representing 121 avian species, we found
   that the proportion of bird species successfully established was high in
   all mediterranean systems (more than 40\% for all five regions). Species
   differed in their likelihood to become established, although success was
   not higher for those originating from mediterranean systems than for
   those from nonmediterranean regions. Controlling for this taxonomic
   effect with generalized linear mixed models, species introduced into
   mediterranean islands did not show higher establishment success than
   those introduced to the mainland. Susceptibility to avian invaders,
   however, differed substantially among the different mediterranean
   regions. The probability that a species will become established was
   highest in the Mediterranean Basin and lowest in mediterranean Australia
   and the South African Cape. Our results suggest that many of the birds
   recently introduced into mediterranean systems, and especially into the
   Mediterranean Basin, have a high potential to establish self-sustaining
   populations. This finding has important implications for conservation in
   these biologically diverse hotspots.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, Petri nets and neural networks are used together in the
   development of an intelligent logic controller for an experimental
   manufacturing plant to provide the flexibility and intelligence required
   from this type of dynamic systems. In the experimental setup, among
   deformed and good parts to be processed, there are four different part
   types to be recognised and selected. To distinguish the correct part
   types, a convolutional neural net le-net5 based on-line image
   recognition system is established. Then, the necessary information to be
   used within the logic control system is produced by this on-line image
   recognition system. Using the information about the correct part types
   and Automation Petri nets, a logic control system is designed. To
   convert the resulting Automation Petri net model of the controller into
   the related ladder logic diagram (LLD), the token passing logic (TPL)
   method is used. Finally, the implementation of the control logic as an
   LDD for the real time control of the manufacturing system is
   accomplished by using a commercial programmable logic controller (PLC).}},

Abstract = {{Microbial community composition (cyanobacteria and eukaryotic microalgae
   abundance and diversity, bacterial abundance, and soil respiration) was
   studied in subglacial and periglacial habitats on five glaciers near
   Ny-Alesund, Svalbard (79 degrees N). Soil microbial communities from
   non-vegetated sites (subglacial, recently deglaciated, and cryoconite
   sediments) and sites with plant cover (deglaciated some hundreds of
   years ago) were analyzed. Physicochemical analyses (pH, texture, water
   content, organic matter, total C and N content) were also performed on
   the samples. In total, 57 taxa of 23 genera of cyanobacteria and algae
   were identified. Algae from the class Chlorophyceae (25 species) and
   cyanobacteria (23 species) were richest in biodiversity. The numbers of
   identified species in single habitat types were 23 in subglacial, 39 in
   barren, 22 in cryoconite, and 24 in vegetated soils. The highest
   cyanobacterial and algal biovolume and cell numbers, respectively, were
   present in cryoconite (13 x 10(4) mu m(3) mg(-1) soil and 508 cells per
   mg of soil), followed by barren (5.7 x 10(4) and 188), vegetated (2.6 x
   10(4) and 120), and subglacial (0.1 x 10(4) and 5) soils. Cyanobacteria
   prevailed in all soil samples. Algae (mainly green algae) were present
   only as accessory organisms. The density of bacteria showed a slightly
   different trend to that of the cyanobacterial and algal assemblages. The
   highest number of bacteria was present in vegetated (mean: 13,722 x
   10(8) cells per mg of soil dry wt.), followed by cryoconite (3802 x
   10(8)), barren (654 x 10(8)), and subglacial (78 x 10(8)) soils.
   Response of cyanobacteria and algae to physical parameters showed that
   soil texture and water content are important for biomass development. In
   addition, it is shown that nitrogen and water content are the main
   factors affecting bacterial abundance and overall soil respiration.
   Redundancy analysis (RDA) with forward selection was used to create a
   model explaining variability in cyanobacterial, algal, and bacterial
   abundance. Cryoconites accounted for most of the variation in
   cyanobacteria and algae biovolume, followed by barren soils.
   Oscillatoriales, desmids, and green coccoid algae preferred cryoconites,
   whereas Nostocales and Chroococcales occurred mostly in barren soils.
   From the data obtained, it is evident that of the studied habitats
   cryoconite sediments are the most suitable ones for the development of
   microbial assemblages. Although subglacial sediments do not provide as
   good conditions as cryoconites, they support the survival of microbial
   communities. Both mentioned habitats are potential sources for the
   microbial recolonization of freshly deglaciated soil after the glacier
   retreat.}},

Abstract = {{The temporal behavior of negative oxygen ions in argon/oxygen mixtures
   is investigated in a pulsed inductively excited modified GEC reactor.
   The negative ion densities are measured by laser photodetachment of
   negative ions in combination with a Langmuir probe as well as by
   absorption of photons due to photodetachment with cavity fing-down
   spectroscopy. An unexpected high density of negative oxygen ions was
   found at high plasma densities. The high density of negative oxygen ions
   may account for the high oxidation rates of silicon in microwave
   discharges. The main loss mechanism for negative oxygen ions at plasma
   densities above 5 (.) 10(10) cm(-3) is mutual neutralization with
   positive ions. Measurements of atomic oxygen densities show that
   collisions of the atoms with negative ions are a minor loss process for
   the negative ions. According to predictions of common models it is
   unlikely that the density of the negative ions is high at such plasma
   densities. It is, therefore, necessary to invoke an additional
   production channel for the negative ions in order to explain the
   observed high negative ion density. It is likely that negative ions are
   generated to a considerable amount by dissociative attachment to excited
   oxygen molecules too. Two possible reactants for this generation can be
   considered, namely Rydberg oxygen molecules or metastable oxygen
   molecules O-2(M)(A(3)Sigma(+)(u), C-3 Delta(u), c(1)Sigma(-)(u)). (c)

Abstract = {{Effective chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer is urgently needed. The aim
   of this study was to compare the anti-proliferative activity on
   pancreatic cancer cell lines of the vitamin D-3 analog,
   22-oxa-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, maxacalcitol, with that of
   1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, calcitriol, with analysis of vitamin D
   receptor status and the G(1)-phase cell cycle-regulating factors.
   Antiproliferative effects of both agents were compared using the
   3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide method and
   by measuring the tumor size of xenografts inoculated into athymic mice.
   Scatchard analysis of vitamin D receptor contents, and mutational
   analysis of receptor complementary DNA were performed. Levels of
   expression of cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases and cyclin-dependent
   kinase inhibitors, p21 and p27, were analysed by western blotting. In
   vitro, maxacalcitol and calcittiol markedly inhibited the proliferation
   and caused a G, phase cell cycle arrest with the appearance of numerous
   domes. In vivo, maxacalcitol inhibited the growth of BxPC-3 xenografts
   more significantly than calcitriol, without inducing hypercalcemia.
   Responsive cells had abundant functional vitamin D receptors. However,
   Hs 766T, showing no response to either agent, had the second highest
   receptor contents with no abnormalities in its primary structure deduced
   by receptor complementary DNA. In the responsive cells, p21 and p27 were
   markedly up-regulated after 24 h of treatment with both agents. In
   non-responsive cells, no such changes were observed. In conclusion,
   maxacalcitol and calcitriol up-regulate p21 and p27 as an early event,
   which in turn could block the G(1)/S transition and induce growth
   inhibition in responsive cells, and maxacalcitol may provide a more
   useful tool for the chemotherapy of pancreatic cancer than calcittiol
   because of its low toxicity. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{128}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: We hypothesized that higher plasma levels of von Willebrand
   factor (vWF) and reduced ristocetin cofactor activity (RCA)vWF ratios at
   baseline and follow-up would be associated with an increased risk of
   death in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).
   Background: Endothelial injury and dysfunction cause increased vWF
   levels in patients with cardiovascular disease. Increased vWF is
   associated with a higher risk of death in patients with coronary artery
   disease, congestive heart failure, and ARDS. In PAH, vWF is elevated and
   functions abnormally, resulting in reduced platelet binding. The
   ability, of vWF to bind platelets is reflected by RCA.
   Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study, of 66 PAH patients
   who underwent initial evaluation at our center from January 1994 to June
   2002. The primary outcome was death or lung transplantation.
   Results: vWF level was directly associated with Factor VIII activity,
   RCA, fibrinogen, and prothrombin time (p <= 0.01). vWF levels at
   baseline and follow-up were associated with the risk of death (hazard
   ratio {[}HR] per 50\% increase, 1.4; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI],
   1.1 to 1.8 {[}p = 0.02]; and HR per 50\% increase, 1.5; 95\% CI, 1.1 to
   2.0 {[}p = 0.011]; n = 48, respectively). RCA/vWF ratios were not
   associated with outcome. These results were unaffected by, adjustment
   for demographics, baseline hemodynamics, laboratory results, or PAH
   therapy, in multivariate analyses.
   Conclusions: Increased vWF levels at baseline and follow-up are
   associated with worse survival in patients with PAH; however, RCA/vWF
   ratios are not. The hemostatic effects of vWF do not account for these
   findings. This suggests that endothelial injury and dysfunction may
   persist despite treatment and may impact on disease course. Therapies
   that target endothelial injury may therefore improve outcomes for
   patients with PAH.}},

Abstract = {{Ankle arthroscopy is indicated for numerous sports-related injuries and
   conditions. It provides a rapid and reliable means of directly
   visualizing and treating all ankle intraarticular structures and can be
   a valuable adjunct in the treatment of ankle fractures. Advances in the
   areas of instrumentation and diagnostic imaging, namely magnetic
   resonance imaging, have expanded the role for ankle athroscopy. Ankle
   arthroscopy is relatively simple but can be significantly more
   challenging than routine knee or shoulder work. It is of critical
   importance to have the proper equipment and to consider certain aspects
   of patient positioning to optimize surgical success. Sports medicine
   specialists and general orthopedic surgeons, as well as foot and ankle
   specialists, should feel comfortable performing diagnostic ankle
   arthroscopy. A straightforward technique for routine ankle arthroscopy
   is presented. Operative results from the United States Naval Academy
   will be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Background To date researchers have given little attention to the use of
   quality of life (QOL) data for organization and systems-level change.
   This article presents two state-level examples of how QOL data are
   currently used in the USA.
   Method Individuals with intellectual disability (ID) were assessed on an
   ongoing basis using two multidimensional QOL instruments. Data were
   analysed at the individual and organizational level.
   Results Examples of statewide data utilization include: (1) determining
   significant predictors of quality outcomes; (2) developing provider
   profiles; (3) comparing individuals with ID with those without ID; (4)
   developing state-level performance standards; and (5) implementing
   continuous programme improvement.
   Conclusions The availability of this type of data allows service
   delivery systems to: (1) significantly alter the relationship between
   individual consumers and service providers; (2) open the system to
   scrutiny by citizens with and without ID; (3) improve responsiveness and
   quality outcomes; and (4) shape future directions of the service
   delivery system for people with ID.}},

Abstract = {{Archaea encode a DNA ligase composed of a C-terminal catalytic domain
   typical of ATP-dependent ligases plus an N-terminal domain similar to
   that found in eukaryotic cellular and poxvirus DNA ligases. All archaeal
   DNA ligases characterized to date have ATP-dependent adenylyltransferase
   and nick-joining activities. However, recent reports of dual-specificity
   ATP/NAD(+) ligases in two Thermococcus species and Pyrococcus abyssi and
   an ATP/ADP ligase in Aeropyrum pernix raise the prospect that certain
   archaeal enzymes might exemplify an undifferentiated ancestral stage in
   the evolution of ligase substrate specificity. Here we analyze the
   biochemical properties of Pyrococcus horikoshii DNA ligase. P.
   horikoshii ligase catalyzes autoadenylylation and nick sealing in the
   presence of a divalent cation and ATP; it is unable to utilize NAD+ or
   ADP to promote ligation in lieu of ATP. P. horikoshii ligase is
   thermophilic in vitro, with optimal adenylyltransferase activity at 90
   degrees C and nick-joining activity at 70 to 90 degrees C. P. horikoshii
   ligase resembles the ligases of Methanobacterium thermautotrophicum and
   Sulfiblobus shibatae in its strict specificity for ATP.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: People with schizophrenia have exhibited reduced functional
   activity in the anterior cingulate cortex during the performance of many
   types of cognitive tasks and during the commission of errors. According
   to conflict theory, the anterior cingulate cortex is involved in the
   monitoring of response conflict, acting as a signal for a need for
   greater cognitive control. This study examined whether impaired conflict
   monitoring in people with schizophrenia could underlie reduced anterior
   cingulate activity during both correct task performance and
   error-related activity.
   Method: Functional activity in the anterior cingulate of 13
   schizophrenia patients and 13 healthy comparison subjects was
   investigated by using event-related fMRI and a Stroop task that allowed
   simultaneous examination of activity during both conflict (incongruent
   trials) and error (commission of error trials).
   Results: In the presence of comparable reaction time measures for
   conflict as well as comparable error rates, the schizophrenia subjects
   showed both decreased conflict- and error-related activity in the same
   region of the anterior cingulate cortex. Moreover, those with
   schizophrenia did not exhibit significant post-conflict or post-error
   behavioral adjustments.
   Conclusions: Concurrently reduced conflict- and error-related activity
   in the anterior cingulate cortex along with reduced trial-to-trial
   adjustments in performance has not previously been reported in
   schizophrenia. The current results suggest that impaired conflict
   monitoring by the anterior cingulate cortex might play an important role
   in contributing to cognitive control deficits in patients with
   schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{Background \& Aims: Current methods to detect malignancy in mucinous
   cystic neoplasms of the pancreas remain inadequate. The role of detailed
   molecular analysis in this context was investigated. Methods: Endoscopic
   ultrasound-guided pancreatic cyst aspirates were prospectively collected
   during a period of 19 months and studied for cytology, carcinoembryonic
   antigen level, and molecular analysis. Molecular evaluation incorporated
   DNA quantification (amount and quality), k-ras point mutation, and broad
   panel tumor suppressor linked microsatellite marker allelic loss
   analysis by using fluorescent capillary electrophoresis. The sequence of
   mutation acquisition was also calculated on the basis of a clonal
   expansion model, and comparison was made to the final pathology.
   Results: Thirty-six cysts with confirmed histology were analyzed. There
   were 11 malignant, 15 premalignant, and 10 benign cysts. Malignant cysts
   could be differentiated from premalignant cysts on the basis of fluid
   carcinoembryonic antigen level (P =.034), DNA quality (P =.009), number
   of mutations (P =.002), and on the sequence of mutations acquired (P
   <.001). Early k-ras mutation followed by allelic loss was the most
   predictive of a malignant cyst (sensitivity, 91\%; specificity, 93\%).
   Conclusions: Malignant cyst fluid contains adequate DNA to allow
   mutational analysis. A first hit k-ras mutation followed by allelic loss
   is most predictive of the presence of malignancy in a pancreatic cyst.
   This approach should serve as an ancillary tool to the conventional
   work-up of pancreatic cysts. Cumulative amount and timing of detectable
   mutational damage can assist in diagnosis and clinical management.}},

Abstract = {{Effect of insulin on ovarian follicular dynamics was studied using
   ultrasonographic scanning in 14 cyclic, non descript goats for 2
   consecutive oestrous cycles. The animals were divided randomly into 2
   groups having 7 animals in each group. Animals of group A (treatment
   group) were treated with long acting purified bovine insulin @0.2 IU/kg
   body weight/goat/day subcutaneously during their first cycle on days 7,
   8, 9. The animals of group B (control) received normal saline instead of
   insulin on above days. The ovaries of all animals were subjected to
   transrectal ultrasonographic scanning using beta-mode scanner equipped
   with 6 MHz linear array transducer on day 0, 4, 8 and 13 for 2
   consecutive oestrous cycles. The result revealed significant increase in
   the population of small follicles on days 0, 4 8 and 13 following
   administration of insulin in the second cycle than untreated control.
   The medium follicles following, administration of insulin increased
   significantly on day 13 during first cycle and on days 0, 4, 8 in the
   second cycle than untreated control. The number of large follicles,
   however, did not differ significantly following administration of
   insulin during first and second cycle excepton day 13 in second cycle.
   The diameter of large follicles following administration of insulin
   increased significantly in both the cycles, however, diameter of medium
   size follicles did not increase during first and second cycle than
   untreated control. The corpus luteum in control, as well as in insulin
   treated goats was detected on day 4 using ultrasonography. The number of
   CL did not differ significantly within and between groups. The diameter
   of CL increased significantly (P<0.01) in insulin treated goats on days

Abstract = {{UV radiation of polymers causes photo-oxidation degradation which
   results in loss of physical and mechanical properties and limits their
   applications. In order to study long term stability of the radiated
   cross-linked polyethylene films on outdoor exposure, low density
   polyethylene (PE) in pure form mixed with photostabilizers and
   antioxidant (PE-st) was irradiated by electron beam in air at 30-300 kGy
   doses. The irradiated samples were exposed to the outdoor condition for
   24 months.The gel content of irradiated samples demonstrated that
   cross-linking reaction has occurred and caused the increasing mechanical
   properties. The results of FTIR measurments show that upto 200 kGy
   carbonyl formation is negligible. Increase of carbonyl groups and
   decrease of mechanical properties in irradiated and outdoor exposed
   samples are indication of degradation progress in cross-linked polymer
   structure. In addition, some of the irradiated samples were buried under
   the soil. Observation of unchanged chemical structure of buried samples
   after 24 months, proves that UV light and oxygen are the main factors of
   their degradation.}},

Abstract = {{Study objectives: The aim of this study was to elucidate the clinical
   characteristics and treatment responses of tuberculosis developing in
   patients receiving anticancer chemotherapy.
   Design: Retrospective case-control study.
   Setting: The Seoul National University Hospital, a tertiary referral
   hospital in South Korea.
   Patients: From January 1, 2000, to July 31, 2004, patients with
   tuberculosis detected during the course of anticancer chemotherapy were
   enrolled as cases. Age- and sex-matched tuberculosis patients without
   any malignant disease were selected as control subjects.
   Measurements and results: Twenty-four patients and 48 control subjects
   were enrolled. Their mean +/- SD age was 56.3 +/- 14.3 years, and the
   male-to-female ratio was 3:1. The most common malignancy was gastric
   cancer (43\%). Lymphoma (17\%), lung cancer (8\%), and head and neck
   cancer (8\%) were also common. In both groups, the lung was the most
   common site of tuberculosis involvement (87.8\% and 79.2\%,
   retrospectively). The presence of scar tissue suggesting old
   tuberculosis on radiography was more common in patients with
   tuberculosis receiving anticancer chemotherapy (66.7\% vs 43.8\%, p =
   0.07). No difference in radiographic severity was observed between
   groups. A regimen based on first-line antituberculosis drugs was started
   in all subjects. Frequency of completion of the expected
   antituberculosis chemotherapy was lower in patients with tuberculosis
   developing with anticancer chemotherapy (58.3\% vs 79.2\%, p = 0.02),
   but it was not different after excluding the loss due to progression of
   underlying malignancies. Bacteriologic/radiographic responses to
   treatment and toxicity of antituberculosis medication sufficient to
   change or stop treatment were not different in both groups.
   Conclusions: With regard to radiographic and clinical responses to
   antituberculosis treatment, tuberculosis developing during anticancer
   chemotherapy is not clinically different from tuberculosis developing in
   ordinary situations. Findings in this study suggest that anticancer
   chemotherapy is not an obstacle in treating tuberculosis.}},

Abstract = {{It was reported that verapamil is metabolized via hepatic microsomal
   cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and that naringin (a component of grapefruit
   juice) inhibits CYP3A4 in humans. Hence, after oral administration of
   verapamil, the total area under the plasma concentration-time curve from
   time zero to time infinity (AUC) of verapamil and the
   AUC(verapamil)/AUC(D-617) (a metabolite of verapamil) ratio were
   significantly greater after oral grapefruit juice in humans. The aim of
   this study was to determine whether similar results could be obtained
   from rabbits. The pharmacokinetics of verapamil and one of its
   metabolites, norverapamil, were investigated after oral administration
   of verapamil at a dose of 9 mg/kg without or with oral naringin at a
   dose of 7.5 mg/kg in rabbits. With naringin, the AUC of verapamil was
   significantly greater (28.4 versus 18.4 mu g min/ml). Although, the AUC
   values of norverapamil were not significantly different between groups
   without and with naringin, the AUC(verapamil)/AUC(norverapamil) ratio
   was considerably greater (1.49 versus 1.11) with naringin. The above
   data suggested that the metabolism of verapamil and the formation of
   norverapamil was inhibited by naringin possibly by inhibition of CYP3A
   in rabbits. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Few biologically based models to assess the risk of soybean rust have
   been developed because of difficulty in estimating variables related to
   infection rate of the disease. A fuzzy logic system, however, can
   estimate apparent infection rate by combining meteorological variables
   and biological criteria pertinent to soybean rust severity. In this
   study, a fuzzy logic apparent infection rate (FLAIR) model was developed
   to simulate severity of soybean rust and validated using data from field
   experiments on two soybean cultivars, TK 5 and G 8587. The FLAIR model
   estimated daily apparent infection rate of soybean rust and simulated
   disease severity based on population dynamics. In weekly simulation, the
   FLAIR model explained > 85\% of variation in disease severity. In
   simulation of an entire epidemic period, the FLAIR model was able to
   predict disease severity accurately once initial values of disease
   severity were predicted accurately. Our results suggest that a model
   could be developed to determine apparent infection rate and an initial
   value of disease severity in advance using forecasted weather data,
   which would provide accurate prediction of severity of soybean rust
   before the start of a season.}},

Volume = {{129}},
Number = {{10}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Context.-A micropapillary carcinoma (MC) component is generally
   considered to behave aggressively. Although several reports have
   described the prognostic significance of MC in breast carcinomas,
   immunohistochemical findings of MC, especially as compared to non-MC,
   are rarely described.
   Objective.-We compared clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical
   findings between 38 cases of invasive breast carcinoma with an MC
   component (IMC) and 217 cases of invasive breast carcinoma without an MC
   component (NIMC).
   Design.-We constructed a tissue microarray from 38 cases of IMC and
   performed immunohistochemical stainings; for cytokeratin (CK) 7, CK20,
   estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, p53, c-Erb-B2, CD34, CK5,
   epidermal growth factor receptor, and c-Kit in both MC and non-MC
   components.
   Results.-Cases with IMC were associated with greater tumor size, more
   frequent lymphovascular invasion, nodal metastases, greater mean numbers
   of positive lymph nodes, and higher stage than those with NIMC, but were
   not associated with poorer survival rates. On immunohistochemistry, only
   p53 reactivity was statistically different between MC and non-MC
   components in IMC cases. Estrogen receptor positivity tended to be lower
   in MC than non-MC, but the difference was not significant. Most of the
   MCs and non-MCs in IMC cases were positive for CK7, but none of them
   were positive for CK20, CK5, epidermal growth factor receptor, or c-Kit.
   Conclusions- Based on the frequent nodal metastases and association with
   higher stage found in IMC as compared with NIMC cases, as well as higher
   p53 positivity and lower frequency of estrogen receptor expression, MC
   could be considered an aggressive histologic type of breast carcinoma.
   in both MC and non-MC components in IMC cases, no basallike
   immunostaining pattern was detected.}},

Abstract = {{A curved bridge can have two different bearing directions: chordal and
   tangential direction. This may bring differences of load distribution
   due to moving vehicles and structural behavior of a curved bridge. This
   study presents a 3D numerical model that can demonstrate the dynamic
   responses of a curved bridge to moving vehicles more precisely. The
   dynamic response induced by the centrifugal rolling motion of a vehicle
   is identified according to the variations of the superelevation and the
   radius of curvature of the deck. Dynamic characteristics of the curved
   bridge with the moving vehicle are analyzed under the condition of the
   support types and two different support systems. In general, while the
   vehicle is passing over the curved bridge, the negative reaction occurs
   in the inside of the girder. The final result shows that the support
   system located outside the girder is more advantageous than other
   systems, and the characteristics of load distributions differ from the
   others in the various conditions of support systems.}},

Abstract = {{Preparation of nanostructured TiO2 powders for efficient photocatalyst
   was investigated through a direct crystallization from aqueous TiOCl2
   solutions containing various metal-chlorides. The TiO2 powders without
   any additives and those added with Ni2+, Fe3+ and Nb5+ ions,
   respectively, which has a similar cationic radius to Ti4+, were mainly
   crystallized to rutile phase, whereas those added with Al3+ and Zr4+
   ions, which have a quite different positive ionic radius, were mainly
   crystallized to anatase phase. On the other hand, the secondary
   particles in the TiO2 powder consisted of acicular and spherical primary
   particles corresponding to rutile and anatase phases, respectively. From
   these results, it seems that the cationic radius of the additives could
   affect phase formation as well as morphology of TiO2 precipitates. Among
   the TiO2, powders prepared, Ni2+ doped powder, showing mainly rutile
   phase, had excellent photocatalytic ability in decomposition of
   4-chlorophenol.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. To determine the factors affecting long-term patency of
   crossover femorofemoral bypass (ITB) graft.
   Design. A retrospective clinical study of a prospectively registered
   database.
   Materials. Two hundred and sixteen FFBs performed for 192 patients with
   atherosclerotic iliac occlusive disease.
   Methods. The clinical and surgical variables influencing graft patency
   were assessed with log-rank test and Cox's proportional hazard analysis.
   Results. The primary patency rates of all FFB grafts at 3 and 5 years
   were 73 +/- 4 and 65 +/- 5\%, respectively. By multivariate analysis,
   hypertension (Odds ratio 2.8, P = 0.002) and critical ischemia (Odds
   ratio 0.42, P = 0.01) significantly (P < .05) influenced long-term
   patency of FFB grafts.
   Conclusion. The long-term patency of FFB graft was not affected by
   procedural modifications. Graft patency was inferior in patients with
   severe lower limb ischemia but superior in patients with hypertension.
   Further study is required to clarify the mechanism of an unexpected
   beneficial effect of hypertension on FFB graft patency.}},

Abstract = {{A full annulus fluidic flow-contolled compressor stator ring was
   designed and tested in the third stage of a four-stage low-speed
   research compressor The solidity of the flow-controlled stator was near
   unity and significantly below design practice with a commensurately high
   diffusion factor. The design intent was to reduce the vane count by 30\%
   and load the stator to the point of stall at the design point, then
   employ flow control to restore attached boundary, layers and regain
   design-point stage matching. The flow control applied, which maintained
   attached flow, was 1\% of the compressor mass flow and was introduced
   via discrete steady jets on he suction side of the stator The design
   method used steady Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with the flow,
   control jets simulated to drive stator exit angles, velocities, and
   blockage to match the baseline machine. The experiment verified the
   pretest predictions and demonstrated degraded compressor performance
   without flow control and restoration of the pumping characteristics of
   the baseline high solidity compressor when flow control was applied. An
   assessment of the engine cycle impact of the flow-controlled compressor
   shows a 2.1 point stage efficiency reduction for the increased loading.
   Extrapolation of the data and analysis to a highspeed compressor shows a
   more modest 0.5 point stage efficiency trade.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: The osteogenicity of bone marrow has been well documented in
   the literature. The use of bone marrow as a source of osteoprogenitor
   cells for spinal fusion surgery is increasing. Improper aspiration
   technique can lead to dilution of bone marrow and a subsequent reduction
   in osteoprogenitor cells. Therefore, correct aspiration technique is
   imperative to the successful use of bone marrow with various grafting
   combinations.
   METHODS: The authors describe techniques for aspirating bone marrow from
   the anterior and posterior iliac crest, as well as vertebral body
   aspiration. The use of selective cell retention to increase the number
   of osteoprogenitor cells populating a graft is also described.
   RESULTS: Complications from bone marrow aspiration can occur, but the
   incidence is rare.
   CONCLUSION: Clinical studies currently under way will answer the
   question of bone marrow efficacy in spinal fusion surgery.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The paper describes a collaborative project between
   librarians and health care staff to enhance patient recovery by
   distributing educational videos and evaluating the acceptability of this
   ``information intervention.{''}
   Background: On inpatient units, nurses experience decreased time to
   teach patients. Text handouts do not include multimedia information, and
   reading levels may limit comprehension. Because the postoperative period
   is not the optimal time for patient instruction, another format and
   opportunity for postsurgical instruction was needed.
   Methods: Nurses, therapists, educators, and librarians partnered to
   select a video designed for home viewing by discharged patients. It was
   added to the existing text-based educational program for coronary
   patients. An evaluation component was incorporated into this
   collaboration.
   Results: The library's role extended to all aspects of the program's
   implementation and management. The library's circulation system was used
   to coordinate borrowing with minimal loss. Ongoing preparation of the
   video materials for distribution and return remained a library function,
   and the evaluation component showed patients' positive reception of the
   video.
   Discussion: Patients received a greater amount of information to enhance
   self-care during the recovery period without consuming more nursing
   time. Video circulation and reuse enhanced cost effectiveness of the
   program, and patients benefited from the library's resources.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To develop a physiologic test of nasal responsiveness in
   mice and to evaluate whether mice with acute bacterial sinusitis develop
   nasal hyperresponsiveness.
   Design: Several experimental studies will be described. The first was a.
   titration pilot study. The second was a randomized, placebo-controlled
   study. The remainder were before-and-after trials.
   Species: BALB/c or C57BL/6 mice.
   Interventions: For these experiments, we exposed mice to histamine
   intranasally, then counted the number of sneezes and nose rubs as the
   primary outcome measure of nasal responsiveness. First, we constructed a
   dose-response curve. Second, we treated the mice with desloratadine, a
   histamine 1 receptor antagonist, prior to histamine exposure. Third, we
   challenged, with intranasal histamine, mice made allergic using 2
   techniques. Fourth, we infected mice with Streptococcus pneumoniae to
   determine whether acute sinusitis causes nasal hyperresponsiveness to
   histamine exposure.
   Results: Nasal histamine challenge led to a reproducible, dose-dependent
   increase in sneezing and nose rubs. The response to histamine exposure
   was blocked by desloratadine (P:<=.05). Allergic mice had a significant
   increase in responsiveness (P <=.05) over baseline after exposure to
   antigen. Mice with acute sinusitis had a sustained increase in
   responsiveness, although less severe than after allergy, compared with
   baseline values that lasted 12 days after infection (P <=.05).
   Conclusions: Nasal challenge with histamine is a physiologic test of
   nasal responsiveness. The hyperresponsiveness of allergic mice to
   histamine exposure parallels the response to nonspecific stimuli during
   the human allergic reaction. In addition, we showed that acute bacterial
   sinusitis causes nasal hyperresponsiveness in mice.}},

Abstract = {{Western corn rootworm (WCR), Diabrotica virgifera virgifera L., is the
   most serious insect pest of corn, Zea mays L., in North America. Crop
   rotation had successfully controlled this pest until the late 1980s when
   a new biotype that lays its eggs in non-com crops was discovered in
   Illinois. This biotype has spread to parts of Indiana, Michigan, and
   Ohio, and threatens Ontario. By using emergence cages, Pherocon Am (R)
   sticky traps and corn root ratings, egg-laying behaviour of WCR in
   Ontario was assessed in strip crop settings that represent typical
   cropping systems of southern Ontario. WCR adults were active in both
   soybean and winter wheat fields in July and August. Larval feeding and
   adult emergence in first-year corn fields following soybean and wheat
   were similar, confirming that oviposition did occur in both crops. These
   data do not, however, provide conclusive evidence for the presence of
   the rotation resistant WCR in Ontario because previous studies have
   demonstrated that WCR are capable of utilizing other crops for
   oviposition.}},

Abstract = {{To meet the Argo Project's accuracy goal for salinity measurements (+/-
   0.01), several measurement schemes for profiling float observations were
   examined using the standard Argo software calibration for salinity. In
   this study, salinity calibration errors are evaluated in data series
   observed by employing several different measurement schemes. In the
   North Pacific the accuracy goal can be achieved by programming for
   constant measurements to a depth of 1500 db or more; however,
   measurements in the mixed water region require the adoption of a scheme
   that constantly measures salinity profiles to the marginal capability
   depth of floats (e.g., 2000 db), so that calibration errors can be
   minimized. In contrast, in the tropical regions of the Pacific and
   eastern Indian Ocean, 1000-db profiles provide salinity data of
   sufficient quality. When floats use a Park and Profile scheme, it is
   recommended that they be programmed to measure deeper profiles every
   observation cycle. Otherwise, it is impossible to detect and correct
   suspicious data, such as a salinity jump in which a salinity measurement
   suddenly differs from previous measurements by 0.02-0.03 or more.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate effects of green-leaf nutrient status on senesced-leaf
   nutrient concentrations and resorption efficiency, we developed a
   database of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations in green and
   senesced leaves from 92 published studies. We fit power functions (i.e.,
   {[}nutrient](sen) = A {[}nutrient](gr)(B)) separately for N and P The
   database encompassed 297 perennial species of different life-forms.
   Across these divergent species and conditions, a,major control on
   senesced-leaf. nutrient concentration was green-leaf nutrient status;
   nutrient concentrations in senesced leaves were positively associated
   with green-leaf nutrient concentrations (r(2) values from 51\% to 84\%).
   Within-species variation as well as species differences contributed to
   the overall variation in nutrient concentrations. Moreover, N and P
   resorption efficiency decreased, respectively, with increased N and P
   green-leaf status; fitted power functions indicated that a
   disproportionate amount of nutrient remained in senesced leaves of
   higher green-leaf nutrient status. Functional relationships between
   nutrient concentrations in senesced and green leaves were in
   distinguishable for evergreen and deciduous species, but evergreens
   tended to have lower concentrations in both senesced and green leaves.
   General relationships (across species and environments) between.
   senesced- and green-leaf nutrient concentrations and broad,
   intraspecific variation in nutrient concentrations suggest that
   variation in resorption efficiency and proficiency could be a result

Abstract = {{Objectives: This study was designed to assess survival and identify
   prognostic factors for liver metastases diagnosed by systematic
   screening in uveal melanoma patients. Methods: Among 602 consecutive
   patients treated over 10 years for uveal melanoma and followed by
   systematic semi-annual hepatic screening (abdominal ultrasonography), 63
   (10.5\%) developed liver metastases; these patients form the basis of
   this study. Factors including patient demographics, characteristics of
   the uveal tumor, metastasis-free interval, severity of liver metastatic
   involvement, and treatments of metastases were studied retrospectively
   regarding their prognostic value, using univariate (Kaplan-Meier method)
   and multivariate (Cox model) analyses. Results: Thirty-five patients
   (55.6\% of the metastatic population) received systemic chemotherapy or
   best supportive care only; 14 patients (22.2\% of the metastatic
   population) diagnosed with diffuse liver involvement had cytoreductive
   surgery and intra-arterial chemotherapy; 14 (22.2\% of the metastatic
   population) had complete surgical removal of liver metastases followed
   by postoperative intra-arterial chemotherapy. No significant surgical
   complications were experienced. The median overall survival after
   diagnosis of liver metastases was 15 months. It reached 25 months for
   selected patients with complete resection (P=0.0002). In this cohort of
   63 patients, ten or fewer preoperatively diagnosed metastases and
   primary uveal melanoma not involving the ciliary body were independently
   associated with better prognosis. Conclusions: This study suggests that
   selected patients with screened liver metastases from uveal melanoma may
   benefit from aggressive treatment, including surgery. The two
   independent favorable prognostic factors are fewer than ten metastases
   at screening and the absence of ciliary body involvement.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of a divalent metal ion in a negatively charged aspartic
   acid pocket is essential for phosphorylation of response regulator
   proteins. Here, we present metal binding studies of the Bacillus
   subtilis response regulator Spo0F using NMR and mu ESI-MS. NMR studies
   show that the divalent metals Ca2+, Mg2+ and Mn2+ primarily bind, as
   expected, in the Asp pocket phosphorylation site. However, identical
   studies with Cu2+ show distinct binding effects in three specific
   locations: (i) the Asp pocket, (ii) a grouping of charged residues at a
   site opposite of the Asp pocket, and (iii) on the beta 4-alpha 4 loop
   and the beta 5/alpha 5 interface, particularly around and including
   H101. mu ESI-MS studies stoichiometrically confirm the NMR studies and
   demonstrate that most divalent metal ions bind to Spo0F primarily in a
   1:1 ratio. Again, in the case of Cu2+, multiple metal-bound species are
   observed. Subsequent experiments reveal that Mg2+ supports
   phosphotransfer between KinA and Spo0F, while Cu2+ fails to support KinA
   phosphotransfer. Additionally, the presence of Cu2+ at non-lethal
   concentrations in sporulation media for B. subtilis and the related
   organism Pasteuria penetrans was found to inhibit spore formation while
   continuing to permit vegetative growth. Depending on the type of
   divalent metal ion present, in vitro phosphorylation of Spo0F by its
   cognate kinase KinA can be inhibited.}},

   non-medical curricula, but its effectiveness in medical education has
   not been studied extensively. We evaluated the impact of TBL on the
   academic performance of Year 2 medical students at Wright State
   University by comparing this active learning strategy against a
   traditional method of case-based group discussion (CBGD).
   METHODS A prospective crossover design assigned 83 Year 2 medical
   students to either CBGD or TBL for 8 pathology modules in the
   systems-based curriculum. The effectiveness of both learning methods was
   assessed by performance on pathology-based examination questions
   contained in end-of-course examinations. The highest and lowest academic
   quartiles of students were evaluated separately. Students' opinions of
   both methods were surveyed.
   RESULTS No significant differences in whole group performance on
   pathology-based examination questions were observed as a consequence of
   experiencing TBL versus CBGD. However, students in the lowest academic
   quartile showed better examination performance after experiencing TBL
   than CBGD in 4 of 8 modules (P = 0.035). Students perceived that the
   contributions of peers to learning were more helpful during TBL than
   CBGD (P = 0.003).
   CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that TBL and CBGD are equally
   effective active learning strategies when employed in a systems-based
   pre-clinical pathology curriculum, but students with lower academic
   performance may benefit more from TBL than CBGD.}},

   spring steels was investigated using six different steels. Slow strain
   rate tensile test and thermal desorption spectroscopic analysis were
   applied to specimens subjected to wet-dry cyclic corrosion tests in a
   NaCl solution. Experimental results revealed that the reduction in
   ductility after the corrosion tests was pronounced with increasing
   strength level. This degradation was closely associated with the
   resistance to pitting corrosion. Consequently, the hydrogen absorbed in
   steel and the corrosion pit as a geometric damage were responsible for
   the EE of spring steels. The hydrogen in rust layer had no significant

Abstract = {{We previously revealed that spin sprayed Ni-Zn ferrite films had a weak
   in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy induced parallel to the liquid
   flow direction during the spin spraying. Adding a small amount of Co to
   the films, we made the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy definitely strong.
   The imaginary part of the complex permeability (mu = mu' - j mu `') of
   the Co-containing films measured in the remanence state exhibited a dual
   step-like dispersion. In order to reveal the influence of magnetic
   anisotropy of the films on the magnetic resonance, we deposited, in this
   study, films \#1 (Ni0.17Zn0.22Fe2.61O4) and \#2
   (Ni0.19Zn0.20Co0.03Fe2.58O4) by spin spray ferrite plating at 90 degrees
   C. The imaginary permeability in the remanence state of the film \#1
   (which exhibited no definite in-plane magnetic anisotropy) had a maximum
   at about 450 MHz, which increased with increasing external dc magnetic
   field, H-dc in the range of 1-3 GHz to give a similar spectrum to that
   of the film \#2. The resonance field, H-R of the film \#2 under H-d of
   1-2 kOe, which was strong enough to saturate the magnetization,
   exhibited a prominent in-plane angular dependence, while HR of the film
   \#1 exhibited a very weak angular dependence. The difference between the
   maximum and the minimum values of HR for the film \#2 was about 60 Oe.
   This means that the film \#2 consists of two regions, one with a
   crystalline anisotropy field having an in-plane isotropic distribution
   due to the cubic spinel structure, and the other with an induced
   uniaxial anisotropy field, H-k of about 60 Oe. Assigning Hk of 60 Oe, we
   calculated the natural resonance frequency, f(r) as 1.6 GHz. This value
   approximately coincided with that of the higher frequency step of mu `'
   for the film \#2 in the remanence state. This suggests that the magnetic
   loss in the remanence state for the films like \#2 (which exhibit
   prominent uniaxial anisotropy induced in film plane) is ascribed to the
   two regions described above.}},

   levels of the soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) in 74

   tumour stage and previous therapy. Serum values of sgp130 were
   determined in the same patients. As controls we took healthy persons (n
   = 18 for sICAM-1; it = 28 for sgp130). Two parameters were determined by
   ELISA. The serum values of sICAM-I were significantly elevated compared
   to controls in stages III + IV both without and after previous
   chemo/radiotherapy (P < 0.05). In stages I + II without or with previous
   therapy there was no significance. The serum values of sgp 130 were
   increased significantly at each tumour stage both without and after

   sICAM-I and sgp130 in patients with progression (tumour stage III + IV

   In this study, we explored the endotracheal delivery of fibroblasts to
   the lung parenchyma as a means of repairing damaged alveolar structures
   directly or indirectly for the delivery of transgenes. Fibroblasts were
   isolated from the lungs of neonatal transgenic mice expressing GFP
   during the period of rapid alveolarization. These GFP(+) cells
   maintained their myofibroblast phenotype in culture and expressed
   elastin and a-smooth muscle actin mRNA. We administered GFP(+)
   fibroblasts to saline- and elastase-treated mice by endotracheal
   instillation. We detected more GFP(+) fibroblasts in the alveolar walls
   and in the interstitial areas of elastase-injured lungs than in normal
   lungs as assessed by immunohistochemistry and fluorescent imaging. The
   presence of GFP(+) fibroblasts in the interstitium demonstrated
   transepithelial migration of these cells. Expression of GFP(+)
   fibroblasts in recipient lungs was maintained for at least 20 d after
   endotracheal administration. These cells synthesize matrix components
   including elastin in vitro and could contribute to restoring the

Title = {{A screen for Nigericin-resistant yeast mutants revealed genes

Abstract = {{Little is known about the regulation of ion transport across the inner
   mitochondrial membrane in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To approach this
   problem, we devised a screening procedure for facilitating the
   identification of proteins involved in mitochondrial ion homeostasis.
   Taking advantage of the growth inhibition of yeast cells by
   electroneutral K+/H+ ionophore nigericin, we screened for genetic
   mutations that would render cells tolerant to this drug when grown on a
   nonfermentable carbon source and identified several candidate genes
   including MWM31, MDM32, NDI1, YMR088C (VBA1), CSR2, RSA1, YLR024C, and
   YNL136W (EAF7). Direct examination of intact cells by electron
   microscopy indicated that mutants lacking MDM31 and/or MDM32 genes
   contain dramatically enlarged, spherical mitochondria and that these
   morphological abnormalities call be alleviated by nigericin.
   Mitochondria isolated from the Delta mdm31 and Delta mdm32mutants
   exhibited limited swelling in an isotonic solution of potassium acetate
   even in the presence of an exogenous K+/H+ antiport. In addition, growth
   Of the Mutants was inhibited oil ethanol-containing media in the
   presence of high concentrations of salts (KCl, NaCl, or MgSO4) and their
   mitochondria exhibited two- (Delta mdm31 and Delta mdm32) to threefold
   (Delta mdmi31 Delta mdm32) elevation in magnesium content. Taken
   together, these data indicate that Mdm31p and Mdm32p control
   mitochondrial morphology through regulation of mitochondrial cation
   homeostasis and the maintenance of proper matrix osmolarity.}},

Abstract = {{Avian tuberculosis was diagnosed histopathologically and
   microbiologically in two pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) and two peafowl

   tuberculosis in the aviary was 6\%. Non-mineralized caseogranulomas were

   lung (2 cases), and cloaca (1 case). Granulomas in the lung were present
   only in peafowl. The presence of granulomas in the lung of both infected
   peafowl suggests that peafowl were exposed to the agent via the
   respiratory route rather than the alimentary route. Histopathologic
   findings were typical of avian tuberculosis, including acid fast bacilli
   and centrally located caseo-necrosis surrounded by epitheloid
   macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells. Mycobacterium

Abstract = {{Rationale: Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), an important
   measure of pulmonary disease severity in patients with cystic fibrosis
   (CF), is frequently expressed as a percentage of a predicted value
   derived from a healthy reference population. There are limitations to
   comparing the lung function of a patient with CF to that of healthy
   control subjects, and potential advantages to comparing it to that of
   other patients with CF.
   Objective: To estimate CF-specific percentiles of FEV1 as functions of
   height, age, and sex.
   Methods: We used 287,108 FEV1 observations among more than 21,000
   patients with CF in the CF Foundation National Patient Registry between
   1994 and 2001. The percentiles were estimated using quantile regression
   methods.
   Results: FEV1 percentile ``growth grids{''} are presented, allowing
   comparison of an individual's FEV1 to that of patients with CF of the
   same sex, age, and height. Their potential uses in clinical practice and
   research are illustrated.
   Conclusions: CF-specific reference equations allow individual patients'
   FEV1 to be placed in the context of the distribution of lung function of
   their peers with CF, and should improve generalizability of CF clinical
   trials by setting entry criteria that are equitable across sex and age
   ranges. They may serve as a useful adjunct to conventional reference
   equations.}},

Abstract = {{Chromosome rearrangements in squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva (SCV)
   have indicated common consistent regions of loss and gain. The overall
   aim of our research was to define and characterize individual genes that
   underlie the pathogenesis of SCV. Thirteen cell lines from 12 SCV
   patients were evaluated for loss and gain of 122 genes distributed
   throughout the genome. Individual genes were analyzed for genetic
   alterations using a novel genomewide strategy, the multiplex
   ligation-dependent probe amplification assay. Our candidate gene
   approach identified several altered loci. Most frequent was the loss of
   I copy of TMSB10, observed in 11 of 12 SCV patients, followed by loss of
   CTNNBI and BCL2, which occurred in 7 of 12 patients. Frequent
   gains/amplifications included CCNDl, observed in 8 of 12 patients, and
   IL12A, in 7of the 12 patients. Loss and gain of specific genes observed
   in our study were generally concordant with the results of previous
   studies of cytogenetics and CGH utilizing the same SCV cell lines.
   Genetic alterations are hallmarks of tumorigenesis, and there is wide
   agreement that recurrent altered genomic loci contain genes important
   for tumor development and progression. Understanding the interplay of
   cancer genes and the pathways they utilize can lead to the detection of
   novel molecular targets in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of
   SCV. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Title = {{Defining childhood atopic phenotypes to investigate the association of
   atopic sensitization with allergic disease}},
Journal = {{ALLERGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1280-1286}},

Abstract = {{Aims: Although atopic sensitization is common in childhood, its
   relationship to clinical allergic disease remains incompletely
   understood. We therefore sought to explore this relationship by defining
   sensitization based atopic phenotypes.
   Methods: Children were recruited at birth (n = 1456) and reviewed at 1,
   2, 4 and 10 years. Skin prick testing (SPT) to common allergens was done
   at 4 (n = 980) and 10 years (n = 1036) with lung function (n = 981),
   bronchial challenge (n = 784) and serum IgE (n = 953) testing at 10.
   Atopic phenotypes were defined, by sensitization pattern, for children
   with SPT at both 4 and 10 years (n = 823).
   Results: Of phenotyped children, 68.0\% were never atopic, 4.3\% early
   childhood atopic (only atopic at age 4), 16.5\% chronic childhood
   atopics (at 4 and 10 years) and 11.2\% delayed childhood atopics (only
   at 10). Never atopics showed small but identifiable prevalence of
   allergic diseases such as asthma, eczema and rhinitis. Amongst
   allergen-sensitized subjects, aeroallergen predominated over food
   sensitization throughout childhood. Chronic childhood atopics showed
   highest prevalence of lifetime plus persistent wheeze, eczema and
   rhinitis, increased prevalence of aeroallergen sensitization, some
   evidence of persistent food sensitization, significantly greater cord
   IgE than never atopics (P = 0.006), plus higher total IgE (P < 0.001)
   and bronchial hyper-responsiveness (P < 0.001) at 10 years than other
   phenotypes.
   Conclusions: A proportion of childhood eczema, rhinitis and asthma is
   nonatopic. The commonest childhood pattern of atopy is chronic
   sensitization, associated with early, persisting and clinically
   significant allergic disease. The currently accepted childhood `Allergic
   March' may oversimplify the natural history of childhood atopy and
   allergic disease.}},

Abstract = {{An accurate series solution has been obtained for a piece-homogeneous
   elastic plane containing a finite array of non-overlapping elliptic
   inclusions of arbitrary size, aspect ratio, location and elastic
   properties. The method combines standard Muskhelishvili's representation
   of general solution in terms of complex potentials with the
   superposition principle and newly derived re-expansion formulae to
   obtain a complete solution of the many-inclusion problem. By exact
   satisfaction of all the interface conditions, a primary boundary-value
   problem stated on a complicated heterogeneous domain has been reduced to
   an ordinary well-posed set of linear algebraic equations. A properly
   chosen form of potentials provides a remarkably simple form of solution
   and thus an efficient computational algorithm. The theory developed is
   rather general and can be applied to solve a variety of composite
   mechanics problems. The advanced models of composite involving up to
   several hundred inclusions and providing an accurate account for the
   microstructure statistics and fiber-fiber interactions can be considered
   in this way. The numerical examples are given showing high accuracy and
   numerical efficiency of the method developed and disclosing the way and
   extent to which the selected structural parameters influence the stress
   concentration at the matrix-inclusion interface. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

   5 at.\% X in an Ar+N-2 discharge. Special emphasis is laid on
   investigating structural, mechanical and tribological properties. X-ray
   diffraction showed that a more pronounced hexagonal structure appears
   due to the incorporation of these alloying elements thus affecting the
   hardness. Hf and Nb additions yield similar friction and wear properties
   up to 700 degrees C, whereas the B containing coating failed at 700
   degrees C. Widening of the ternary metastable Ti1-xAlxN solid solution

Abstract = {{We investigate the dynamics in an ensemble of chaotic elements with
   nondiffusive coupling. First, we analyze the case of global coupling.
   The type of coupling we consider leads to the suppression of
   oscillations in the whole ensemble at a high coupling strength. A
   distinct feature of this transition from high-dimensional chaos at a low
   coupling strength to the stationary state is that there is no partially
   ordered phase characterized by a large number of coexisting synchronized
   clusters. A two-cluster mode emerges abruptly, replacing the
   asynchronous mode. We focus on the influence of connectivity on the
   dynamics in the two-cluster modes and their domains of existence. We
   introduce a parameter that characterizes the connectivity: the range of
   coupling. Our computational and analytical results indicate that the
   most significant changes in the dynamics occur in the case of local
   coupling, when extra connections are added. By contrast, if the range of
   coupling is high, even substantial changes in this range have a small
   influence on the dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Aim. This paper reports a study to inform curriculum development by
   exploring the contribution of bioscience education programmes to nurses'
   clinical practice, their understanding of the rationale for practice,
   and their perceptions of their continuing professional development
   needs.
   Background. The future of the health services worldwide depends on nurse
   education programmes equipping practitioners to deliver safe and
   effective patient care. In the developed world, the structure and
   indicative content of nursing curricula have been debated extensively.
   However, despite the rapid expansion in nursing roles brought about by
   social change, there is little information on the educational needs of
   nurses in developing countries.
   Methods. This study was undertaken in government teaching hospitals in
   Cape Town, South Africa in 2003. A purposive sample of 54 nurses from a
   range of clinical settings completed questionnaires and described
   critical incidents where bioscience knowledge had directed practice.
   Questionnaires were analysed descriptively, in the main. Analysis of
   critical incident reports was based on Akinsanya's bionursing model.
   Findings. Most nurses felt that their understanding of the biological,
   but not the physical sciences, was adequate or better: all felt
   confident with their knowledge of anatomy, compared with 57.4\% (31/54)
   for microbiology. Respondents attributed the successes and failures of
   their education programmes to their teachers' delivery of content,
   ability to relate to practice and management of the process of learning.
   The biological, but not the physical, sciences were universally
   (96-100\%) regarded as relevant to nursing. However, the critical
   incidents and nurses' own reports indicated a need for further education
   in pharmacology (40/54, 74.1\%) and microbiology (29/54, 53.7\%).
   Conclusion. To meet the needs of nurses in developing countries, and
   empower them to meet the increasingly complex demands of their expanding
   roles, nurse educators need to consider increasing the curriculum
   content in certain key areas, including pharmacology and microbiology.}},

   determined with the different modalities (+/- standard deviation) were:
   542 +/- 29 mu m, 576 +/- 37 mu m, 530 +/- 34 mu m, and 552 +/- 32 mu m
   for rotating Scheimpflug imaging, for uncorrected and for corrected
   scanning slit pachymetry, and for ultrasound, respectively. The
   differences between modalities (+/- 95\% limits of agreement) were -9.8
   +/- 31 mu m between rotating Scheimpflug and ultrasound, 24 +/- 31.2 mu
   m between scanning slit and ultrasound, and 33 +/- 27 mu m between
   scanning slit and rotating Scheimpflug imaging. The limits of agreement
   for within and between observer effects were within 4.2\% of the
   absolute CCT values for scanning slit and ultrasound and within 2.2\%
   for the rotating Scheimpflug imaging. The rotating Scheimpflug camera
   showed similar SD/N ratios but steeper edges of the corneal surfaces in
   the intensity profile plots. Conclusion. in the assessment of normal
   corneas, the Pentacam measured CCT values closer to ultrasound
   pachymetry and with less variability compared with Orbscan. The
   (interobserver) reproducibility with the Pentacam was highest of all 3
   modalities.}},

   not give a correct value and uncertainty when the activity has the same

   propose a method of solving the problem based on Bayesian decision
   theory. The a priori distribution used is Jeffreys' invariant obtained
   by taking into account the fact that the number of particles emitted and
   detected is Poisson distributed. In contrast to the classical approach,
   the Bayesian estimate is always positive and the result obtained is a
   whole distribution (a confluent hypergeometric function) that gives not
   only the mean value but also any confidence interval. For higher
   activities, the Bayesian and classical estimates are indistinguishable.}},

Abstract = {{Ternary content-addressable memories (TCAMs) have gained wide acceptance
   in the industry for storing and searching Access Control Lists (ACLs).
   In this paper, we propose algorithms for addressing two important
   problems that are encountered while using TCAMs: reducing range
   expansion and multi-match classification.
   Our first algorithm addresses the problem of expansion of rules with
   range fields-to represent range rules in TCAMs, a single range rule is
   mapped to multiple TCAM entries, which reduces the utilization of TCAMs.
   We propose a new scheme called Database Independent Range PreEncoding
   (DIRPE) that, in comparison to earlier approaches, reduces the
   worst-case number of TCAM entries a single rule maps on to. DIRPE works
   without prior knowledge of the database, scales when a large number of
   ranges is present, and has good incremental update properties.
   Our second algorithm addresses the problem of finding multiple matches
   in a TCAM. When searched, TCAMs return the first matching entry;
   however, new applications require either the first few or all matching
   entries. We describe a novel algorithm, called Multi-match Using
   Discriminators (MUD), that finds multiple matches without storing any
   per-search state information in the TCAM, thus making it suitable for
   multi-threaded environments. MUD does not increase the number of TCAM
   entries needed, and hence scales to large databases.
   Our algorithms do not require any modifications to existing TCAMs and
   are hence relatively easy to deploy. We evaluate the algorithms using
   real-life and random databases.}},

Abstract = {{A novel hyphenated technique, HPLC-SPE-NMR, was used for accelerated
   identification of isoflavonoids from the roots of Smirnowia iranica. The
   extract constituents eluted from a HPLC column were automatically
   trapped on solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges, and NMR spectra were
   acquired with concentrated solutions after solvent change. The
   structures of 10 new isoflavonoids (1, 4, 5, 7-10, 12, 13, 16) and of
   seven previously described constituents (2, 3, 6, 11, 14, 15, 17) were
   elucidated from NMR spectra acquired in the HPLC-SPE-NMR mode. Multiple
   peak trapping on the same SPE cartridge increased analyte amounts and
   provided access to 2D NMR data. It was demonstrated that linear
   accumulation of material is possible in up to seven repeated trapping
   steps. The use of HPLC-SPE-NMR speeded up dereplication of the S.
   iranica extract considerably by providing detailed information about the
   constituents of a complex, essentially crude extract prior to their
   preparative-scale isolation or extract prefractionation, and the
   information obtained could be used to direct preparative isolation work.
   In connection with structure elucidation of isoflavonoids containing
   O-methylated 1,2,3-benzenetriol moieties as the B-ring,
   O-methylation-induced changes of chemical shifts of aromatic hydrogens
   were found to depend on the conformation of the resulting methoxy group,
   i.e., on the number of its ortho substituents. The recognized
   regularities will be useful in structure determination of partially
   O-methylated polyphenols based on 1D H-1 NMR spectra obtainable from
   HPLC-SPE-NMR experiments, diminishing dependence on 2D NMR data and C-13
   NMR chemical shifts.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate the early and late outcome after endovascular
   treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm (EVAR) in octogenarians compared
   with patients aged < 80 years.
   Methods. Patients treated for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) with
   endovascular repair during the period 1996 to 2004 were collated in the
   EUROSTAR registry. This study group consisted of 697 patients aged 80
   years. Comparison was made with 4198 patients aged < 80 years with
   regard to the incidence of preoperative characteristics and outcomes of
   the procedure.
   Results. The proportion of octogenarians treated by EVAR increased
   during the study period, from 11\% in the first year to 18\% in the last
   year. Octogenarians more frequently had cardiac disease, impaired renal
   function, and pulmonary disease (P = .03, P < .0001 and P = .0001).
   Thirty-two percent of the octogenarians were recorded unfit for open
   surgery as opposed to 22\% in younger patients (P < .0001); they also
   had a larger aneurysm diameter (62 vs 58 mm, respectively; P < .0001).
   The 30-day and in-hospital mortality in octogenarians was 5\% vs 2\% in
   the younger group (P < .0001). More device-related complications and
   systemic complications, including cardiac disease, were noted in
   octogenarians (7\% vs 5\% and 19\% vs 11\%, P = .03 and P < .0001,
   respectively). This group of patients also had a higher incidence of
   postoperative hemorrhagic complications, including hematoma (7\% vs 3\%,
   P < .0001, respectively). No differences in conversion to open repair
   and post-EVAR rupture rate were observed. Aneurysm-related mortality and
   late all-cause mortality was 7\% vs 3\% and 10\% vs 7\%, both P < .0001.
   Conclusion: Our study supports that EVAR might be considered when
   treating elderly patients, provided their aneurysms are anatomically
   suited for the endovascular technique. The risk for late complications
   compared with open repair may be outweighed by a lower early mortality
   as well as a shorter time for physical recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Choristomas of the internal auditory meatus are very uncommon tumors.
   Because of their rarity and the lack of a consistent clinical and
   radiological pattern, they are usually misdiagnosed as vestibular
   schwannomas. Surgical exploration usually shows involvement of the
   vestibular, cochlear or facial nerve by the tumor, representing a
   diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to the surgeon. In this report, a
   case of a smooth muscle choristoma of the internal auditory meatus is
   presented. The lesion involved the vestibular and cochlear nerves and
   was extremely adherent to the facial nerve. Microscopic examination of
   the tumor revealed nerve fibers, smooth muscle and a small amount of
   adipose tissue. No striated muscle was found. The contemporary
   terminology, diagnosis and management of this infrequent lesion are
   analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{This article estimates the returns to education for households who
   derive part of their income from household based non-farm
   self-employment ventures in rural Peru. While education is an individual
   level variable, earnings are observed at the household level. This
   asymmetry complicates both the estimation and the interpretation Of the
   returns to education. This article is the first jointly to incorporate
   three channels through which education affects household earnings.
   Education affects earnings through the marginal productivity of labour
   (worker effect), labour allocation across activities (between activity
   allocative effect) and its production externality effect (spillover
   effect). The results suggest that the between-activity allocative
   effects of education dominate the returns. This article also makes novel
   use of economic geography to proxy for the role that access to markets
   plays in determining these returns. In particular, altitude is a strong
   predictor of activity choice and the returns to education in this
   mountainous country.}},

Abstract = {{Background The true risk of choronic villus sampling (CVS) is poorly
   defined. The objective of this study was to review the clinical outcome
   of transabdominal CVS performed in a university teaching unit, with an
   emphasis on the complication rate.
   Methods A comprehensive audit database was maintained for 1351 pregnant
   women, including 17 sets of twin pregnancies, who had a CVS. Details and
   outcome of all CVSs made in the unit between May 1996 and May 2004 were
   reviewed. All CVSs were performed by one of 5 operators using the
   identical. techniques.
   Results All procedures were performed transabdominally. A total of 1355
   CVSs were performed because there were 4 dichorionic twin pregnancies
   which required 2 punctures. The mean gestation at CVS was (11.8 +/- 0.
   7) weeks, and 97.3\% of the procedures were performed between 11 and 13
   completed weeks. The majority (96.2\%) required only I puncture to
   achieve correct needle placement. The procedure failed to obtain an
   adequate sample in 4 subjects (0.30\%). A total of 1351 chromosomal
   studies were requested and there was I case (0.07\%) of culture failure.
   The results of chromosomal studies were available within 14 days in
   36.7\% of the cases and within 21 days in 94.0\%. Overall, 77
   chromosomal abnormalities (5.7\%) and 5 cases of thalassemia major were
   detected. Pregnancy outcome was unknown in only 13 singleton subjects
   (0.96\%). In the remaining 1355 fetuses, there were 76 pregnancy
   terminations (5.56\%), 10 fetal losses with obvious obstetric causes
   (0.73\%), and 21 potentially procedure-related fetal losses (1.54\%). in
   the last group, the majority had one or more co-existing obstetric
   complications. The background fetal loss rate for pregnancies at similar
   gestational age in the unit was about 0.8\%. Therefore, the
   procedure-related fetal loss rate was estimated to be at the maximum of
   0.74\%.
   Conclusions In experienced hands, first trimester transabdominal. CVS is
   an accurate and safe invasive prenatal diagnostic procedure. It should
   be one of the treatment options available to pregnant women who require
   prenatal genetic diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{A growing number of brain imaging studies are being undertaken in order
   to better understand the contributions of multisensory processes to
   human behavior and perception. Many of these studies are designed on the
   basis of the physiological findings from single neurons in animal
   models, which have shown that multisensory neurons have the capacity for
   integrating their different sensory inputs and give rise to a product
   that differs significantly from either of the unisensory responses. At
   certain points these multisensory interactions can be superadditive,
   resulting in a neural response that exceeds the sum of the unisensory
   responses. Because of the difficulties inherent in interpreting the
   results of imaging large neuronal populations, superadditivity has been
   put forth as a stringent criterion for identifying potential sites of
   multisensory integration. In the present manuscript we discuss issues
   related to using the superadditive model in human brain imaging studies,
   focusing on population responses to multisensory stimuli and the
   relationship between single neuron measures and functional brain imaging
   measures. We suggest that the results of brain imaging studies be
   interpreted with caution in regards to multisensory integration. Future
   directions for imaging multisensory integration are discussed in light
   of the ideas presented.}},

Abstract = {{Context: Low adiponectin levels predict type 2 diabetes, and one
   prospective study in men reported its independent prediction of vascular
   events. Many observers thus already consider adiponectin to be a major
   part of the ``common soil{''} underpinning diabetes and vascular
   disease.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the association
   between adiponectin and incident coronary heart disease (CHD) risk in
   the British Women's Heart and Health Study.
   Design: This was a prospective (4 yr) case (n = 167) control (n = 334)
   study nested within the 4286 women in British Women's Heart and Health
   Study.
   Setting: The study was performed in a primary care setting.
   Participants: The study consisted of women (n = 4286) randomly selected
   from 23 British towns between 1999 and 2001, who were 60 - 79 yr of age
   at baseline.
   Main Outcome Measures: Association of adiponectin with CHD risk factors
   and incident CHD events were the main outcome measures.
   Results: Among both cases and controls, adiponectin positively
   correlated with age and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and
   inversely correlated with waist to hip ratio, fasting insulin, fasting
   glucose, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance scores,
   C-reactive protein, and triglycerides. However, despite adequate power
   and these associations with CHD risk factors, adiponectin did not
   predict CHD events in unadjusted or adjusted analyses. The relative risk
   ratio for a doubling of adiponectin was 0.93 (95\% confidence interval,
   0.78, 1.11).
   Conclusions: It is premature to consider adiponectin as a root for
   vascular disease in women despite its association with insulin
   resistance and diabetes. Additional prospective studies are required to
   determine whether there is a true sex difference in the effect of
   adiponectin on CHD.}},

   combined together into a single test statistic to test whether a fixed

Abstract = {{In this paper we consider and compare special classes of static theories
   of gradient elasticity, nonlocal elasticity, gradient micropolar
   elasticity and nonlocal micropolar elasticity with only one gradient
   coefficient. Equilibrium equations are presented but higher-order
   boundary conditions are not of concern here, since they are not required
   for the problems considered. The connection between gradient theory and
   nonlocal theory is discussed for elasticity as well as for micropolar
   elasticity. Nonsingular solutions for the elastic fields of screw and
   edge dislocations are given. Both the elastic deformation (distortion,
   strain, bend-twist) and the force and couple stress tensors do not
   possess any singularity unlike `classical' theories.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To examine how social models in the school environment and
   individual student characteristics are related to smoking
   susceptibility.
   Methods: Using data from the School Smoking Profile Project, multi-level
   logistic regression analysis was used to identify school and student
   characteristics related to smoking susceptibility among 6679 never
   smokers from 29 secondary schools in Ontario, Canada.
   Results: If a nonsmoking student attended a school where there was
   student smoking on the school periphery, he or she was less likely to be
   susceptible to smoking (OR 0.71, 95\% CI 0.57-0.89). A significant
   contextual interaction between the smoking on the school periphery and
   friends' disapproval of smoking was identified (beta = 0.68 {[}0.23], p
   < .01]; students with friends who disapprove of smoking were more likely
   to be susceptible to smoking if they attended a school with student
   smoking on the school periphery.
   Conclusion: Nonsmoking, students who attend a school with student
   smoking on the school periphery are at an increased risk for being
   susceptible to smoking if they have friends who disapprove of smoking.
   Future school-based smoking prevention programs might benefit from
   targeting both individual students and entire schools with programming
   activities. (c) 2005 Society for Adolescent Medicine. All rights

Abstract = {{Samples from three hot springs (Alla, Seya and Garga) located in the
   northeastern part of Baikal rift zone (Buryat Republic, Russia) were
   screened for the presence of thermophilic nitrifying bacteria.
   Enrichment cultures were obtained solely from the Garga spring
   characterized by slightly alkaline water (pH 7.9) and an outlet
   temperature of 75 degrees C. The enrichment cultures of the ammonia- and
   nitrite oxidizers grew at temperature ranges of 27-55 and 40-60 degrees
   C, respectively. The temperature optimum was approximately 50 degrees C
   for both groups and they thus can be designated as moderate
   thermophiles. Ammonia oxidizers were identified with classical and
   immunological techniques. Representatives of the genus Nitrosomonas and
   Nitrosospira-like bacteria with characteristic vibroid morphology were
   detected. The latter were characterized by an enlarged periplasmic
   space, which has not been previously observed in ammonia oxidizers.
   Electron microscopy, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analyses
   and partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing provided evidence that the nitrite
   oxidizers were members of the genus Nitrospira. (C) 2005 Federation of

   efficient in hardware implementation of both decoders and encoders. The
   hybrid H-matrices are constructed so that both the semi-random technique
   and the partly parallel structure can be applied to design encoders and
   decoders. Using the proposed methods, the implementation of encoders can
   become practical while keeping the hardware complexity of the partly

   Verilog-RDL and are synthesized using a 0.35 mu m CMOS standard cell

Abstract = {{This paper concerns an intelligent digital redesign (IDR) technique for
   a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy observer-based output-feedback control (FOBOFC)
   system. The term IDR involves converting an existing analog control into
   an equivalent digital counterpart in the sense of state-matching. The
   IDR problem is herein viewed as a minimization problem of the norm
   distances between nonlinearly interpolated linear operators to be
   matched. Its constructive condition with global rather than local
   state-matching is formulated in terms of bilinear matrix inequalities.
   The main features of the proposed method are that the state estimation
   error in the plant dynamics is considered in the IDR condition that
   plays a crucial role in the performance improvement; the stability
   property is preserved by the proposed IDR algorithm; the separation
   principle is shown when the premise variables are measurable; finally,
   the IDR condition for a more general FOBOFC-an estimated premise
   variable case is conducted. A numerical example is demonstrated to
   visualize the feasibility of the developed methodology.}},

   can be converted into a pseudo-fluid medium model, i.e., a medium
   represented by its sound speed and density. This technique begins from
   an analytic derivation of the reflection coefficient on a planar
   interface of fluid and porous ocean sediment. Invoking the low grazing
   angle approximation, useful for solving long range propagation problems,
   the pseudo-fluid medium is obtained. Alternate pseudo-fluid medium can
   be obtained through the weak frame approximation (Williams, J. Acous.
   Soc. Am. 110, 2276-2281, 2001). In this paper, we discuss the accuracy
   and limitations of the low grazing angle approximation by numerically
   comparing the reflection coefficient to the full Biot model cases as
   functions of various Biot parameters, frequency, and water sound speed.
   The usefulness of the present low grazing angle approximated
   pseudo-fluid medium in ocean wave propagation modeling is demonstrated
   by comparing the transmission loss results with that of the full Biot
   model.}},

Abstract = {{An analysis has been carried out to investigate the effect of the
   reflectivity on the temperature distribution of a glass panel by
   infrared radiant heating. Halogen lamps are used to heat the panel,
   located near the top and bottom of the rectangular chamber. The thermal
   energy is transferred from the lamps to the panel only by radiation and
   it is considered by using view factor. The conductive transfer is
   limited inside the panel. The results show that the uniformity of the
   temperature distribution of the panel is improved and, at the same time,
   the time for heating increases as the wall reflectivity increases. The
   temperature difference between the center and the corner reaches a
   maximum in the early stage of the heating process and then decreases
   until it reaches a uniform steady-state value.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of live fish tanks in trawlers is to use the catch in a
   better condition and to reduce marine pollution. It also reduces the
   infrastructure meant to freeze the catch to preserve it for longer
   period. But the presence of additional free surface in the vessel
   challenges the stability of the vessel. This is besides the sloshing
   effect due to the moving liquid mass in the tank. Roll motions are
   initiated due to various factors related to the hull characteristics of
   the vessel, loading and operating conditions and its interaction with
   the environment. Location of fish tank, its orientation, arrangement of
   baffles inside the tank to reduce the free surface affects and careful
   design of tank opening are to be given priority during the design,
   manufacturing and tank testing. The results obtained from tank test of
   model are compared with that of analytical method, The non-linear roll
   performance become further complicated due to the free surface and
   sloshing effects of the mass in the live fish tank. Wave makers are used
   for generating waves under laboratory conditions compatible with the
   scaled down model of the trawler model. The tests are conducted in the
   towing tank of Pusan National University. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The physicochemical and biochemical changes in whole lizardfish (Saurida
   micropectoralis) muscles and its fillets kept in air and under vacuum
   during frozen storage at -20C for 24 weeks were investigated. The
   formaldehyde (FA) and dimethylamine contents increased with a
   concomitant decrease in trimethylamine- N-oxide (TMAO) content as the
   storage time increased (P < 0.05). The Ca2+-adenosine 5'-triphosphatase
   activity continuously decreased with a coincidental decrease in
   salt-soluble fraction. The disulfide bonds were increasingly formed
   throughout the storage (P < 0.05). The surface hydrophobicity increased
   and reached the maximum at week 12 with a subsequent decrease up to the
   end of storage. In general, the higher changes were observed in samples
   kept under vacuum than those kept in air. With the same atmosphere used,
   the whole fish showed slightly higher changes than the fillets. A marked
   increase in TMAO demethylase (TMAOase) activities was observed up to 12
   weeks, followed by the continuous decrease up to 24 weeks of storage.
   The produced FA might play an important role in inducing protein
   denaturation and/or aggregation in lizardfish. The TMAOase activity as
   well as the FA formation could be reduced to some extent with the
   removal of internal organs and storage in the presence of oxygen.
   However, a detrimental effect of oxygen, especially on the promotion of
   lipid oxidation, would be an obstacle.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed life tables and reproduction were studied in nymphs and adult
   females of Podisus maculiventris (Say) (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) fed
   larvae of Galleria mellonella L. (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) at constant
   temperatures of 18, 22, 26, and 30 degrees C. Development rates were
   fitted to the equation Y = a + b In x. The theoretical development
   threshold was calculated as T-0 = exp (-a/b), resulting in To = 12.48
   and 12.78 degrees C for females and males, respectively. Degree-days for
   development ranged from 233.92 in males at 18 degrees C to 338.73 in
   females at 30 degrees C. In all temperature treatments, P. maculiventris
   immatures consumed a mean of approximately eight prey items. Mean
   immature body weights were higher at higher temperatures, but females
   were heavier than males only at the fifth instar. In adult female P.
   maculiventris, age at first oviposition ranged from 2.7 d at 30 degrees
   C to 13.4 d at 18 degrees C. Percentage of egg hatch was lowest at 18
   degrees C (11\%) and highest at 30 degrees C (36.4\%). Survivorship
   curves showed a linear decline with time, the steepest curves at the
   highest temperatures. Total number of eggs laid per female ranged from
   429.4 at 18 degrees C to 755.4 at 26 degrees C. Mean egg numbers were
   fitted to a surface equation as eggs = (-6.658 + 0.432T) d exp(-0.002Td)
   where d and T are age (days) and temperature (T), respectively. Net and
   gross reproductive rates were highest at 26 degrees C R, = 379.126;
   gross reproductive rate {[}GRR] = 491.273 female / female) and lowest at
   18 degrees C (R-0 = 207.873; GRR = 294.972). Generation and doubling
   times were shortest at 30 degrees C (T = 35.021 and DT = 4.270 d).
   Intrinsic and finite rates of increase were also highest at 30 degrees C
   (r = 0.1623; lambda = 1.1763). Reproductive parameters were recalculated
   using numbers of eggs that actually hatched, resulting in lower values,
   although the effects of temperature did not change. In the context of
   mass rearing P. maculiventris, 26 degrees C is the optimal temperature
   tested, but female predators > 21 d should be not be used because they
   may not be capable of laying viable eggs.}},

   Migraine diagnosis was made according to the International Headache
   Society Classification. Sixty patients were included in three headache
   outpatient centers (Neurology Departments of the Universities of
   Regensburg, Munster and Munchen). In the acute migraine attack patients
   were treated intravenously with either 1000 mg paracetamol
   (acetaminophen) or placebo. The primary end point was pain-free after 2
   h. Secondary efficacy criteria were pain-free after 24 h or pain relief
   after 2 hours and after 24 hours. With regard to the efficacy criteria,
   37\% of patients reported pain relief or painfree after two hours, 12
   patients after treatment with acetaminophen and 10 patients after
   treatment with placebo. Out of these, 3 patients in the acetaminophen
   and 4 patients in the placebo group were painfree. After 24 hours 86\%
   of the patients reported pain relief: 24 treated with acetaminophen and
   27 treated with placebo. The results indicate, that 1000 mg intravenous
   acetaminophen is not superior to placebo in treating severe acute

Abstract = {{Both the growth and respiration of Candida albicans are sensitive to
   extracts of Allium, sativurn and investigations into the anticandidal
   activities are now focussing on the purified constituents to determine
   the targets of inhibition. Of particular interest is allyl alcohol (AA),
   a metabolic product that accumulates after trituration of garlic cloves.
   Putative targets for AA were investigated by monitoring changes in
   intracellular responses after exposure of C. albicans cells to AA or a
   commercially available garlic extract. Two-photon laser scanning
   microscopy and other techniques were used. Changes typical of oxidative
   stress - NADH oxidation and glutathione depletion, and increased
   reactive oxygen species - were observed microscopically and by flow
   cytometry. Known targets for AA are alcohol dehydrogenases Adh1 and 2
   (in the cytosol) and Adh3 (mitochondrial), although the significant
   decrease in NAD(P)H after addition of AA is indicative of another
   mechanism of action.}},

Volume = {{76}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Background: Regardless of advances in diagnosis and treatment during the
   past 40 years, the overall 5-year survival rates for oral and
   oropharyngeal squamous cancers have only slightly improved and remain
   around 50\%. Thus, the early diagnosis and treatment of carcinoma by
   health care providers are essential in achieving a good prognosis. We
   report a case of invasive squamous cell carcinoma that presented as a
   benign endodontic-periodontic lesion with a 7-mm periodontal pocket on
   tooth \#15 in a 40-year-old, non-smoking woman. The subsequent
   management of the case is also discussed. The study was conducted in
   accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000.
   Methods: Our patient was seen for a comprehensive periodontal
   examination including a periodontal charting, occlusal analysis, study
   casts, electronic pulp test for tooth \#15, and complete mouth
   periapical radiographs. As there was a periapical radiolucency, an
   endodontic consultation was obtained. A periodontal flap surgical
   procedure was performed on teeth \#13 to \#15, and as there was bone
   erosion into the maxillary sinus, a biopsy of the soft tissue was
   submitted to the local hospital for histological analysis.
   Results: The biopsied lesion was diagnosed as invasive, moderately
   differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with focal spindle and clear cell
   differentiation (grade It to III of IV). Bone invasion was also
   identified. The treatment of the carcinoma involved a hemimaxillectomy
   with the removal of the maxillary left posterior teeth. The patient
   remained free of tumor for 5 years after the initial presentation.
   Conclusions: Patient education and periodic oral cancer examinations by
   dental professionals are necessary to reduce diagnostic delay and
   improve prognosis. This case report emphasizes the important role of
   dental professionals, especially periodontists and endodontists, of
   being aware that squamous cell carcinoma may manifest itself clinically
   and/or radio-graphically as a common periodontal or endodontic lesion.}},

Abstract = {{Rationale and Objectives: Severe asthma is characterized by increased
   airway inflammation that persists despite therapy with corticosteroids.
   It is not, however, merely an exaggeration of the eosinophilic
   inflammation that characterizes mild to moderate asthma; rather, severe
   asthma presents unique features. Although arachidonic acid metabolism is
   well appreciated to regulate airway inflammation and reactivity,
   alterations in the biosynthetic capacity for both pro- and
   antiinflammatory eicosanoids in severe asthma have not been determined.
   Methods: Patients with severe asthma were identified according to
   National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Severe Asthma Research Program
   criteria. Samples of whole blood from individuals with severe or
   moderate asthma were assayed for biosynthesis of lipoxygenase-derived
   eicosanoids.
   Measurements and Main Results: The counterregulatory mediator lipoxin
   A(4) was detectable in low picogram amounts, using a novel
   fluorescence-based detection system. In activated whole blood, mean
   lipoxin A(4) levels were decreased in severe compared with moderate
   asthma (0.4 {[}SD 0.4] ng/ml vs. 1.8 {[}SD 0.8] ng/ml, p = 0.001). In
   sharp contrast, mean levels of prophlogistic cysteinyl leukotrienes were
   increased in samples from severe compared with moderate asthma (112.5
   {[}SD 53.7] pg/ml vs. 64.4 {[}SD 24.8] pg/ml, p = 0.03). Basal
   circulating levels of lipoxin A(4) were also decreased in severe
   relative to moderate asthma. The marked imbalance in
   lipoxygenase-derived eicosanoid biosynthesis correlated with the degree
   of airflow obstruction.
   Conclusions: Mechanisms underlying airway responses in severe asthma
   include underproduction of lipoxins. This is the first report of a
   defect in lipoxin biosynthesis in severe asthma, and suggests an
   alternative therapeutic strategy that emphasizes natural
   counterregulatory pathways in the airways.}},

Abstract = {{Jumping spiders have long been known to have large principal eyes with
   ultraviolet (UV) receptors, and many species of their arthropod prey
   have body parts that reflect strongly in the UV waveband. However, no
   attempt has been made to investigate the effects of UV cues from prey on
   the foraging behaviour of jumping spiders. We performed laboratory
   experiments to test the hypothesis that jumping spiders use UV cues for
   locating and discriminating prey. We used Portia labiata, a
   web-invading, spider-eating jumping spider, as the predator and Argiope
   versicolor, an orb-web-building spider that decorates its web with
   UV-reflecting silk stabilimenta, as prey. Portia labiata could detect
   the difference between UV-reflecting and non-UV-reflecting
   stabilimentum-decorated webs and they preferentially approached the
   UV-reflecting ones. These findings may have wide implications for
   studies of animal foraging, and support one hypothesized function of
   salticid UV vision, the role of which is largely unknown. (c) 2005 The

Abstract = {{Previous data demonstrated that conjugated linoleic acid ( CLA) reduced
   eicosanoid release from select organs. We hypothesized that one active
   CLA isomer was responsible for the reduced prostaglandin release and
   that the mechanism was through the inhibition of inducible
   cyclooxygenase2 ( COX- 2). Here, we examined the effects of 10t, 12c-
   CLA and 9c, 11t- CLA on COX- 2 protein/ mRNA expression, prostaglandin E
   2 ( PGE 2) production, and the mechanism by which CLA affects COX- 2
   expression and prostaglandin release. The COX- 2 protein expression
   level was inhibited 80\% by 10t, 12c- CLA and 26\% by 9c, 11t- CLA at
   100 mu M in vitro. PGE 2 production was decreased from 5.39 to 1.12 ng/
   2 x 10(6) cells by 10t, 12c- CLA and from 5.7 to 4.5 ng/ 2 x 10(6) cells
   by 9c, 11t-CLA at 100 mu M. Mice fed 10t, 12c- CLA but not 9c, 11t- CLA
   were found to have a 34\% decrease in COX- 2 protein and a 43\%
   reduction of PGE 2 release in the lung. 10t, 12c- CLA reduced COX- 2
   mRNA expression level by 30\% at 100 mu M in vitro and by 30\% in mouse
   lung in vivo. Reduced COX- 2 mRNA was attributable to an inhibition of
   the nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-kappa B) pathway by 10t, 12c- CLA. These
   data suggested that the inhibition of NF- kappa B was one of the
   mechanisms for the reduced COX- 2 expression and PGE 2 release by 10t,
   12c-CLA.}},

Abstract = {{The urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) is implicated in both cancer
   cell invasion and angiogenesis. It can interact with a specific receptor
   (uPAR) via the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain in the
   urokinase amino-terminal fragment (ATF) in a species-specific manner.
   Our previous studies showed that adenovirus-mediated delivery of murine
   ATF (AdmATF) suppressed human tumor growth in mouse models, by
   inhibiting murine angiogenesis. However, we cannot exclude its putative
   inhibitory action on human cancer cell invasion through a
   uPAR-independent pathway. To further investigate the mechanisms of ATF,
   we constructed another adenovirus, AdhmATF, expressing humanized murine
   ATF (hmATF). hmATF binds to human uPAR but not to murine uPAR. We
   compared the antagonist effect of both AdmATF and AdhmATF on human and
   murine cancer cells. In vitro, the supernatant from AdhmATF-infected
   cells repressed 79\% of membrane-associated uPA activity on human
   MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas that from AdmATF-infected cells repressed 35\%
   of membrane-associated uPA activity. On murine LLC cells, the
   supernatant from AdhmATF-infected cells inhibited 29\% of cell surface
   uPA activity, whereas that from AdmATF-infected cells inhibited 74\% of
   cell surface uPA activity. Similar results were obtained in a cell
   invasion assay. In vivo, intratumoral injection of the adenoviruses into
   LLC tumors on day 24 postinjection induced lower but significant tumor
   growth suppression by AdhmATF (tumor volume was 1185 +/- 128 mm(3)),
   whereas suppression by AdmATF was greater ( 407 +/- 147 mm3). In the
   MDA-MB-231 tumor model, on day 52 postinjection, tumor size was 187 +/-
   47 mm(3) in the AdhmATF-treated group and 468 +/- 65 mm(3) in the
   AdmATF-treated group. The LLC and MDA-MB-231 cell lines transfected by
   mATF or hmATF genes showed growth inhibition in vivo equivalent to the
   results obtained by adenovirus treatment. These results demonstrate the
   strong anticancer activity of ATF even when its uPAR-binding affinity
   has been suppressed, and indicate that ATF exerts an antitumor effect
   via dual mechanisms: essentially through targeting the uPA-uPAR system
   via the EGF-like domain and partially through targeting a
   uPAR-independent interaction via the kringle domain.}},

Abstract = {{Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), the rate-limiting enzyme in prostaglandin
   synthesis, is induced in many cells by numerous inflammatory mediators,
   including nitric oxide (NO). Upregulation of COX-2 expression has been
   implicated in the pathophysiology of neuronal cell death. In the present
   study, we have found that the NO-induced upregulation of COX-2 via
   activation of activator protein-1 (AP- 1) signaling leads to apoptotic
   cell death. Cultured rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells treated with
   sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a NO-releasing compound, exhibited marked
   induction of COX-2 expression, which was associated with apoptotic cell
   death as evidenced by internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, cleavage of
   poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, activation of caspase-3, accumulation of
   p53, increased Bax/Bcl-X-L ratio, and dissipation of mitochondrial
   membrane potential. In addition to the upregulation of COX-2 expression,
   SNP treatment led to activation of AP-1. Pretreatment of PC 12 cells
   with c-fos antisense oligonucleotide abolished the NO-induced increase
   in DNA binding of AP-1 and upregulation of COX-2 expression.
   Furthermore, pretreatment with a selective COX-2 inhibitor (SC58635)
   rescued the PC12 cells from the apoptotic cell death induced by NO.
   Similar results were obtained when the NO-induced upregulation of COX-2
   expression was blocked by the siRNA interference. These results suggest
   that excessive NO production during inflammation induces apoptosis in PC
   12 cells through AP-1-mediated upregulation of COX-2 expression. (c)

Abstract = {{This paper deals with a permutation flow-shop scheduling problem with
   finite intermediate storage (PFSFIS) between successive machines so as
   to minimize makespan. In such a problem the intermediate storage
   capacity constraints are considered besides the machine-related
   constraints usually discussed in the general permutation flow-shop. This
   feature adds extra difficulties to the scheduling problem. In this
   paper, we present some new block properties and a speed-up method using
   a forward-backward hybrid algorithm to compute makespan. Applied in a
   tabu search algorithm, the new block properties greatly reduce the
   neighborhood size and thus shorten the search time. Also, the speed-up
   method eliminates redundant computation for the objective function and
   reduces a majority of the running time. Computational experiments (up to
   200 jobs and 20 machines) are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of
   new block neighborhood characteristics and the speed-up method. Compared
   with the results yielded by the best-known algorithm, the objective
   function is improved by 0.14\% if the new block neighborhood
   characteristics are used; furthermore, the running time is reduced by
   53.7\% on the average if the speed-up method is used. Under the
   condition that both of the algorithms have the same running time the
   objective function is improved by 0.24\% if both of the two above
   improvement methods are applied in the original tabu search.}},

Abstract = {{Infective diarrhoea is common among allogeneic stem cell transplant
   (SCT) recipients, frequently caused by viruses and may be difficult to
   differentiate from acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Viral
   pathogens may directly or indirectly impact upon transplant-related
   mortality. Rotavirus is one of the most common causes of diarrhoea
   worldwide, but one of the least studied causes of diarrhoea post SCT. In
   this retrospective study we describe 21 cases of confirmed rotavirus
   infection in allogeneic SCT recipients. Most of these cases may occur in
   clusters during the winter and spring period. Symptoms of rotaviral
   infection were diarrhoea (95\%), vomiting (62\%), abdominal pain (38\%),
   weight loss and loss of appetite in 38 and 29\% of the cases,
   respectively. Possible extraintestinal manifestations of rotavirus
   infection were observed. The duration of the symptoms in this series
   ranged from 4 days to 4 months with median of 15 days. Patients with
   rotavirus infection were invariably lymphopenic and/or on
   immunosuppression for GVHD. Of the patients diagnosed with rotavirus,
   86\% required hospitalisation. In 57\% of the cases, other viral
   pathogens were isolated near to the rotavirus infection period.
   Rotavirus infection is an important cause of prolonged diarrhoea post
   SCT, causing significant morbidity and frequently requiring
   hospitalisation.}},

   Nonexistent in bulk Cu, this phenomenon is associated primarily with a

   surface-stress-incluced internal stresses due to high surf ace-to-volume
   ratios at the nanoscale level. The temperature-dependence of this
   behavior leads to a shape memory effect (SME). Under tensile loading and
   unloading, the nanowires exhibit recoverable strains up to over 50\%,
   well beyond the typical recoverable strains of 5-8\% for most bulk shape
   memory alloys (SMAs). This behavior is well-defined for wires between

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a new approach to establishing application
   layer conference trees for multimedia multipoint conferences on the
   Internet using the Megaco/H.248 protocol, a Voice over IP (VoIP) media
   gateway control protocol. In existing VoIP protocols (and also legacy
   telephone networks), a multipoint conference takes place through an MCU,
   and forms a star topology centered at the MCU. This paper suggests to
   establishing shared, cost effective conference trees for VoIP
   conferences. Each tree is rooted at the conference initiator, who
   initiates the conference, and spans over all the conference members.
   Tree branches grow or are trimmed dynamically and adaptively, in a way
   to avoid the growth of a skewed tree. We develop a simplified analytical
   model and conduct simulations to evaluate the performance of the
   proposed approach. The results show that our approach enjoys the
   advantage of lower join latency and better bandwidth efficiency compared
   to the traditional MCU approach, and is cost effective compared to a
   near optimal Steiner tree.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The objective of this study was to determine if the use of
   intravenous contrast results in clinically important errors in
   intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) dose calculations for head
   and neck radiotherapy treatment planning.
   Materials and Methods: Nonionic, iodinated intravenous contrast
   (Iohexol) was administered during the treatment planning computed
   tomography (CT) scan of 5 patients with head and neck cancer of varying
   disease sites. The potential effect of intravenous contrast was studied
   by changing the density of the contrast-enhanced vessels. An inverse
   IMRT plan was generated from an unmanipulated ``normal contrast{''}
   planning scan. We then applied the same planning parameters to a ``no
   contrast{''} planning scan. The effect of intravenous contrast was
   quantified by calculating the percent change of dose in a variety of
   target and normal structures. To evaluate a worst-case scenario
   situation, this comparison was repeated by assigning the vessels the
   maximum density in our planning system ({''}maximum contrast{''} density
   plan).
   Results: Dose differences between a planning set of images using
   intravenous contrast and a set of images without contrast were less than
   0.2\% for all relevant target volumes and critical structures. A
   worst-case scenario in which normal contrast was overridden with
   ``maximum contrast{''} led to small dose differences, generally less
   than 0.5\%.
   Conclusions: Planning head and neck IMRT from CT scans that contain
   intravenous contrast does not result in clinically important errors in
   dose delivery.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid and massive scale-up of antiretroviral drug therapy (ART) so
   needed in sub-Saharan Africa will not be possible using a `medicalised'

   many years to provide successful anti-tuberculosis treatment to millions
   of patients in poor countries of the world, and many of the established
   concepts can be used for the delivery of ART. Malawi, a small and
   impoverished country in sub-Saharan Africa, is embarking on anational
   scale-up of ART. In this review we describe how we have adopted several
   of the principles of DOTS for delivering ART in Malawi: case finding and
   registration, treatment, monitoring, drug procurement, staffing and the
   issue of free drugs. We also discuss ART for HIV-infected TB patients.
   We hope that by using the DOTS approach we will be able to deliver ART
   to large numbers of HIV-infected patients under controlled conditions,
   and minimise the risk of developing drug resistance.}},

   Leu(5)]-Enk (H-Tyr-(D)-Ala-Gly-Phe-Leu-OH), and {[}Ala(2) Leu(5)]-Enk
   (H-Tyr-Ala-Gly-Phe-Leu-OH) were conducted to evaluate how the chirality
   of specific amino acid residues (Ala(2) and Leu(5)) in the peptide
   portion affects their bioconversion by esterases. The stability studies
   were conducted at 37 degrees C in plasma and tissue homogenates (liver
   and brain) from five animal species (rat, mouse, canine, guinea pig, and
   hamster) and human in an attempt to identify an animal species that had
   a ``prodrug bioconversion profile{''} comparable to that of humans.
   Initially, the total esterase activity in these biological media was
   measured using p-nitrophenyl butyrate (PNPB) as a substrate. By
   repeating this activity assay in the presence of paraoxon, a potent
   esterase B inhibitor, it was possible to estimate the relative amounts
   of esterases B and esterases A/C in a biological sample. Stability
   studies of the cyclic prodrugs were carried out under identical
   conditions, that is, in the presence and absence of paraoxon.
   Significant differences in the rates of hydrolysis of the cyclic
   prodrugs were observed, particularly between cyclic prodrugs with
   differences in the chirality of the amino acid on the C-terminus of the
   peptide portion, for example, (L)-amino acids at the C-terminus
   hydrolyzed more rapidly than D-amino acids. This stereoselective
   hydrolysis was independent of the animal species but tended to be more
   pronounced in brain and liver homogenates compared to plasma. Increased
   esterase specific activity, as measured by PNPB, in the biological media
   did not necessarily correlate with increased bioconversion rates of the
   cyclic prodrugs. The enzymatic stability profiles of the cyclic prodrugs
   in biological media from canine and guinea pig most closely resembled
   the profiles from human biological media. Therefore, canine and guinea
   pig appear to be the most relevant animal models for conducting
   pharmacokinetic studies on these cyclic prodrugs of opioid peptides. (c)

Abstract = {{Transgenic cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) lines expressing the tobacco
   glutathione S-transferase (GST) Nt107 were evaluated for tolerance to
   chilling, salinity, and herbicides, antioxidant enzyme activity,
   antioxidant compound levels, and lipid peroxidation. Although transgenic
   seedlings exhibited ten-fold and five-fold higher GST activity under
   normal and salt-stress conditions, respectively, germinating seedlings
   did not show improved tolerance to salinity, chilling conditions, or
   herbicides. Glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity in transgenic
   seedlings was 30\% to 60\% higher under normal conditions, but was not
   different than GPX activity in wild-type seedlings under salt-stress
   conditions. Glutathione reductase, superoxide dismutase, ascorbate
   peroxidase, and monodehydroascorbate reductase activities were not
   increased in transgenic seedlings under salt-stress conditions, while
   dehydroascorbate reductase activity was decreased in transgenic
   seedlings under salt-stress conditions. Transgenic seedlings had 50\%
   more oxidized glutathione when exposed to salt stress. Ascorbate levels
   were not increased in transgenic seedlings under salt-stress conditions.
   Malondialdehyde content in transgenic seedlings was nearly double that
   of wild-type seedlings under normal conditions and did not increase
   under salt-stress conditions. These results show that expression of

   stress and suggests that the endogenous antioxidant system in cotton may
   be disrupted by the expression of the tobacco GST.}},

Abstract = {{Few data exist on the use of aggressive combination therapy with
   thienopyridines and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors in higher risk
   patients with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The aim of this study
   was to characterize the combined use of these agents and the associated
   hospital outcomes in patients with ACS enrolled in the multinational
   Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events. Data from 8,081 patients with
   non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction or unstable angina were
   analyzed. Of these patients, 5,070 (62.7\%) received aspirin and a
   thienopyridine, and the remainder received aspirin, a thienopyridine,
   and a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa blocker. The presence of a non-ST-segment
   elevation myocardial infarction; a history of diabetes or coronary
   artery bypass surgery; performance of in-hospital catheterization,
   percutaneous coronary intervention, or coronary artery bypass grafting;
   and in-hospital use of heparin were independent predictors of the use of
   triple antiplatelet therapy with aspirin, thienopyridines, and
   glycoprotein IIb/IIIa blockers. Increased diastolic blood pressure and
   increased serum creatinine were associated with a failure to prescribe
   triple therapy. An increased risk of major bleeding during
   hospitalization was associated with the use of triple antiplatelet
   therapy (odds ratio 1.6, 95\% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.2).
   Aggressive antiplatelet therapy Was used in approximately 2 of every 5
   patients presenting with an ACS. Triple therapy was associated with the
   performance of catheterization and/or percutaneous coronary
   intervention, as well as high-risk patient features. Although no
   differences in hospital death rates were evident in patients receiving
   triple therapy, this population was at significantly increased risk of
   major bleeding episodes during hospitalization. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Title = {{Indentation of rigid cones into conical holes molded in elastic blocks}},

Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Results obtained from several series of experiments on the normal
   loading of rigid spherical and conical indenters onto elastic blocks are
   described. Different series of experiments conducted are (1) normal
   loading of a rigid sphere onto elastic blocks of polydimethylsiloxane of
   different elastic moduli, (2) normal loading of rigid cones of different
   included angles onto a flat of the elastic blocks, and (3) normal
   loading of rigid cones of different included angles into conical holes
   of various included angles molded in the two types of elastic block. It
   was found that the indenter load versus indenter displacement data
   corresponding to the normal loading of the sphere and cones of different
   included angles onto a flat surface of the elastic blocks were very well
   fitted by the theories of Hertz and Sneddon, respectively. It has also
   been found that when rigid cones were loaded into conical holes molded
   in the elastic blocks, the load versus indenter displacement data were
   not fitted by the Sneddon theory for a conical indenter loading onto an
   elastic half space. Neither were the experimental data fitted by a
   modified Sneddon equation in which the effective semi included angle
   beta of the conical indenter was taken as
   beta={[}(pi/2)-(alpha(')-alpha)], with alpha(') and alpha being the
   semi-included angles of the conical hole and the indenter, respectively.
   These results cast some doubt on the validity of some of the current
   methods in use for analyzing the unloading curves obtained from
   nanoindentation experiments made using pointed pyramidal and conical
   indenters on elastic-plastic solids. (c) 2005 American Institute of

Abstract = {{Lumbar microendoscopic diskectomy (MED) has gained widespread acceptance
   as an alternative to conventional open microdiskectomy due to several
   potential advantages, including reductions in postoperative pain and
   recovery time. However, constraints in visualization and working space
   present technical difficulties in the verification of nerve root
   decompression and the identification of sequestered disc fragments. This
   study was undertaken to investigate whether a surgeon-driven, evoked EMG
   paradigm could be used for intraoperative verification of nerve root
   decompression within the technical and mechanical confines of lumbar
   MED. Twenty-two patients underwent intraoperative EMG stimulation
   threshold recordings during lumbar microendoscopic diskectomy. In this
   series, the EMG threshold recorded directly from the nerve root
   immediately prior to diskectomy was 8.6 +/- 4.4 mA. Following
   decompression, the threshold was 4.2 +/- 2.1 mA. The difference in pre-
   and post-decompression EMG stimulation threshold, 4.4 +/- 4.0 mA, was
   statistically significant (p < 0.001). In two of the 22 cases (9.1 \%),
   the EMG threshold was initially unchanged following diskectomy, and
   further exploration revealed sequestered disc fragments. After removal
   of these fragments, an appropriate decrease in the EMG threshold was
   observed. The results from this study suggest that surgeon-driven,
   evoked EMG threshold testing may provide a simple, effective adjunct to
   lumbar microendoscopic diskectomy for intraoperative verification of
   nerve root decompression.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, enantioseparations of five phenothiazines, including
   promethazine, ethopropazine, trimeprazine, methotrimeprazine, and
   thioridazine, in CD-modified CZE using dual CD systems consisting of
   randomly sulfate-substituted CD (MI-S-beta-CD) and a neutral CD as
   chiral selectors in a citrate buffer (100 mm) at pH 3.0 were
   investigated. The results indicate that MI-S-beta-CD is an excellent
   chiral selector for enantioseparation of ethopropazine. The enantiomers
   of promethazine can also be baseline-resolved with MI-S-beta-CD at
   concentrations in the range of 0.5-1.0\% w/v. On the other hand,
   thioridazine and trimeprazine interact strongly with neutral CDs. As a
   result, the enantioselectivity of these two phenothiazines is remarkably
   and synergistically enhanced with increasing the concentration of
   neutral CDs in the presence of MI-S-beta-CD and simultaneous
   enantioseparations of these phenothiazines, except for
   methotrimeprazine, could favorably be achieved with the use of dual CD
   systems. Moreover, by varying the concentration of beta-CD or gamma-CD
   at a fixed concentration of MI-S-beta-CD (0.75\% w/v) reversal of the
   enantiomer migration order of promethazine occurred. This may be
   attributable to the opposite effects of charged and neutral CDs on the
   mobility of the enantiomers of promethazine.}},

   inverter is used. A space vector PWM is presented for the control of
   two-phase motors. The scheme is based on the harmonic injection

Abstract = {{A novel agglutinin gene was cloned from Arisaema lobatum using SMART
   RACE-PCR technology. The full-length cDNA of Arisaema lobatum agglutinin
   (ala) was 1078 bp and contained a 774 bp open reading frame encoding a
   lectin precursor (proproprotein) of 258 amino acid residues with a 23 aa
   signal peptide. ALA contained three mannose-binding sites (QXDXNXVXY)
   with two-conserved domains of 45\% identity, ALA-DOM1 and ALA-DOM2. The
   three-dimensional structure of ALA was very similar to that of GNA
   (Galanthus nivalis agglutinin). ALA shared varying identities, ranging
   from 40\% to 85\%, with mannose-binding lectins from other species of
   plant families, such as Araceae, Alliaceae, Iridaceae, Lillaceae,
   Amaryllidaceae and Bromeliaceae. Genomic sequence of ala was also cloned
   using genomic walker technology, and it was found to contain three
   putative TATA boxes and eight possible CAAT boxes in the 5'-flanking
   region. No intron was found within the region of genomic sequence.
   Southern blot analysis indicated that the ala belonged to a multi-copy
   gene family. Expression pattern analysis revealed that the ala
   preferentially expressed in the tissues with the higher expression being
   found in spadix, bud, leaf, spathe and tuber. The cloning of the ala
   gene not only provides a basis for further investigation of its
   structure, expression and regulation mechanism, but also enables us to
   test its potential role in controlling pests and fungal diseases by
   transferring the gene into plants in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Hepatitis C is a worldwide public health problem and its transmission is
   clearly associated with the parenteral route, however, the virus has

   has been detected in saliva, yet the relationship between HCV and oral

   HCV-RNA in saliva and its correlation with oral pathology was
   undertaken. Saliva and blood samples were collected from 50 anti-HCV
   positive patients and from 25 patients with non-HCV chronic liver
   disease. HCV-RNA was detected in all of the saliva samples from the HCV
   positive group. None of the saliva or serum samples from the non-HCV
   group were positive for HCV-RNA. The patients were examined for dental
   and oral health (dentate, partially dentate, edentulous, evidence of gum
   disease, or mucosal lesions); however, no correlation was found between
   HCV-RNA in saliva, oral health, and viral load. These results suggest
   that HCV-RNA presence in saliva is independent of the viral load and the

Abstract = {{Hairpin poly(amide)s (HPs) are sequence specific DNA-binding compounds
   that have engendered considerable interest as potential pharmacological
   agents to manipulate the expression of specific genes. However, recent
   reports have indicated that the ability of HP conjugates to pass through
   cell membranes is sensitive to the cell type employed and the nature of
   the conjugate. Furthermore, while binding of HPs to DNA sequences in
   vitro is relatively well understood, packing of DNA into chromatin in
   living cells makes predicting the efficiency with which a given
   poly(amide) will bind its cognate site less certain. Previous methods to
   evaluate HP permeability and binding in vivo, while effective, are
   somewhat tedious and qualitative. We report here two related reporter
   gene-based assays that provide a more convenient and quantitative
   measure of poly(amide) permeability and DNA binding activity in living
   cells. We anticipate that these methods will complement existing tools

Abstract = {{Recently, the dynamic call admission mechanism using stochastic control
   was found to be more stable and precise. However, it is still hard to
   get an effective dynamic call admission mechanism for multi-services
   with various requirements of Quality of service (QoS) guarantee,
   bandwidth and handoff rate. Meanwhile, the computational complexity is
   another challenge. Most of the studies on this field cope with this
   problem by setting up a multiple dimensions' stochastic model with high
   cornputational complexity. This paper buffer the data type traffic to
   regulate the occupation of channel and use the proposed single dimension
   stochastic model to compute the key parameters, such as call dropping
   probability and admission probability. The result is decreased
   computational complexity. Numerical results of simulation show that the
   proposed scheme steadily satisfies the hard constraints on call dropping
   probability for multi-services while maintaining a very high channel
   throughput.}},

Abstract = {{Cerebral autoregulation maintains a relatively constant blood flow
   despite changes of blood pressure in the brain. Linear models have been
   extensively applied to identify this mechanism, using spontaneous
   arterial blood pressure (ABP) fluctuation as input and cerebral blood
   flow velocity (CBFV) change as output. Although valuable measurements
   have been achieved by these models, accuracy and consistency are of
   great concern due to the large variability of results. We therefore
   investigated whether more reliable measurements can be achieved by
   selecting only those recordings (or parts of recordings) with relatively
   high spontaneous variability of ABP. Twenty-four recordings, 7 from
   hypercapnia and 17 from normocapnia, of ABP and CBFV from 9 healthy
   adults were analyzed. Two conventional autoregulatory parameters were
   used to assess cerebral autoregulation. In the absence of a `gold'
   standard for the study of dynamic cerebral autoregulation, lower
   variability of the parameters and higher correlation with pCO(2) were
   considered as criteria for identifying improved measures of
   autoregulation. Both significantly lower variability of the parameters,
   and higher correlation between the parameters and pCO(2) were achieved
   from the data with higher variability of blood pressure. We therefore
   conclude that ABP with high variability may effectively stimulate
   regulatory response in blood flow resulting in improved assessment of
   cerebral autoregulation.}},

Abstract = {{The roles of vascular binding, flow, transporters, and enzymes as
   determinants of the clearance of digoxin were examined in the rat liver.
   Digoxin is metabolized by Cyp3a and utilizes the organic anion
   transporting polypeptide 2 (Oatp2) and P-glycoprotein (Pgp) for influx
   and excretion, respectively. Uptake of digoxin was found to be similar
   among rat periportal (PP) and perivenous (PV) hepatocytes isolated by
   the digitonin-collagenase method. The K-m values for uptake were 180 +/-
   112 and 390 +/- 406 nM, V-max values were 13 +/- 8 and 18 +/- 4.9
   pmol/min/mg protein, and nonsaturable components were 9.2 +/- 1.3 and
   10.7 +/- 2.5 mu l/min/mg for PP and PV, respectively. The evenness of
   distribution of Oatp2 and Pgp was confirmed by Western blotting and
   confocal immunofluorescent microscopy. When digoxin was recirculated to
   the rat liver preparation in Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate (KHB) for 3 h
   in absence or presence of 1\% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 20\% red
   blood cell (rbc) at flow rates of 40 and 10 ml/min, respectively,
   biexponential decays were observed. Fitted results based on
   compartmental analyses revealed a higher clearance (0.244 +/- 0.082
   ml/min/g) for KHB-perfused livers over the rbc-albumin-perfused livers
   (0.114 +/- 0.057 ml/min/g) (P < 0.05). We further found that binding of
   digoxin to 1\% BSA was modest (unbound fraction = 0.64), whereas binding
   to rbc was associated with slow on (0.468 +/- 0.021 min (-1)) and off
   (1.81 +/- 0.12 min(-1)) rate constants. We then used a zonal,
   physiologically based pharmacokinetic model to show that the difference
   in digoxin clearance was attributed to binding to BSA and rbc and not to
   the difference in flow rate and that clearance was unaffected by
   transporter or enzyme heterogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) can
   abolish HBV gene expression and replication through a noncytopathic
   mechanism mediated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). However,
   the molecular mechanisms of TNF-alpha antiviral activity are not
   completely understood. To examine TNF-alpha-induced cellular responses
   and identify genes involved in anti-HBV activity, cDNA microarrays
   dotted with 14, 112 human genes were used to examine the transcriptional
   changes in HepG2 after treatment with TNIT-alpha for 6 h. The results
   showed that many genes related to ligands and receptors, signal
   transduction including the TNF-alpha signaling pathway, mitochondrial
   and ribosomal proteins, and transcription regulation were induced by
   TNF-alpha. Interestingly, the TNF-alpha-inducible gene cIAP(2) was found
   to inhibit HBV protein synthesis, viral replication, and transcription.
   Taken together, our results revealed the global effects of TNF-alpha
   treatment on hepatocellular gene expression. The antiviral genes

Abstract = {{Glycolipids GM2, GD2, GD3, fucosyl GM1, sialyl Lewis a (sLe(s)) and
   globo H, and polysialic acid on embryonal NCAM, are cell-surface
   antigens expressed on small cell lung cancer (SCLC) biopsy specimens.
   They are all candidates for inclusion in a polyvalent, antibody-inducing
   vaccine or for adoptive therapy with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
   against SCLC. To identify the minimum optimal combination of target
   antigens on SCLC and to confirm that antibodies against this combination
   might be able to mediate complement activation and lysis in the majority
   of cases, we tested ten SCLC cell lines with fluorescence activated cell
   sorter (FACS) and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) assays using
   mAbs against these seven target antigens individually or pooled in
   different combinations. We find that (1) none of these mAbs demonstrated
   strong FACS reactivity with more than 6 of the 10 cell lines, (2) no mAb
   had strong CDC reactivity with more than 4 of the cell lines, (3) when
   the mAbs were pooled, nine cell lines were strongly positive by FACS and
   nine cell lines were strongly positive by CDC, and (4) mAbs against GM2,
   FucGM1, globo H and polysialic acid was the minimum optimal combination
   for inducing FACS reactivity. The addition of mAbs against sLe(a), GD2
   and GD3 had no additional impact by FACS and only minimal additional
   impact in CDC assays. H345, the only cell line that had less than 30\%
   CDC with the four mAb pool was strongly positive by FACS. To understand
   the lack of correlation between FACS and CDC in the case of H345, the
   ten cell lines were screened for expression of complement resistance
   factors CD55 and CD59. Three cell lines were strongly positive for CD55
   and eight were strongly positive for CD59. Overall, no correlation was
   seen between expression of either of these factors on the ten cell lines
   and sensitivity to CDC. In the case of H345 however, complement
   resistance of H345 is demonstrated to be mediated primarily by CD59, and
   in the presence of mAb against CD59, the four mAb MEM-43 pool induced
   strong (94\%) CDC. CD59 inhibits membrane attack complex formation but
   not activation of earlier complement components. Consequently, all ten
   cell lines are good targets for complement activation by the four
   antibody pool and for elimination by effector mechanisms including
   complement mediated inflammation and opsonization. These findings
   support our plan to develop a tetravalent vaccine against SCLC targeting
   GM2, fucosyl GM1, globo H and polysialic acid.}},

Abstract = {{If buildings, which are designed to old prescriptive fire and building
   codes, are judged by current prescriptive standard, they may be
   considered to have ``sub-standard{''} fire safety protection.
   Improvement works may be considered necessary. However, if improvement
   works are to be carried out at the same time, huge financial burden may
   be imposed on the society. Thus, prioritization of the improvement works
   on the basis of a holistic fire safety evaluation will even the cost
   burden over a period of time and maintain the fire safety in existing
   buildings within a reasonable level. Fire safety ranking methods have
   been developed in many countries to assist the evaluation of the fire
   safety level of buildings. Some of the methods adopting the
   multi-attribute evaluation approach may provide a fire safety audit from
   a holistic point of view. This approach can provide a simple evaluation
   and is particularly useful for complex multi-storey buildings.
   One of the problems of using multi-attribute evaluation approach is the
   manipulation of the imprecise information and definition of some of the
   fire safety attributes. In this paper, a new reliability interval method
   for manipulating the weightings of attributes and a synthetic model on
   the basis of grey system theory is presented. The proposed method adopts
   the grey system theory, which is regarded as one of the methods to
   handle insufficient information, to establish a fire safety ranking
   evaluation framework.}},

Abstract = {{Granular materials forming part of civil engineering structures are
   subjected to both static and dynamic loads. As a result of these loads,
   particle crushing occurs. This study focuses on the evolution of
   crushing in a simulated granular material subjected to a direct shear
   test. It was found that the discrete element method (DEM) can be used to
   visualize and understand the evolution of crushing experienced by a
   granular material during this test. Even though DEM does not normally
   consider particle breakage, it is possible to simulate crushing by
   replacing one particle that has failed in tension with a combination of
   many particles of different sizes. One simulation indicated that
   crushing did not develop uniformly throughout the sample, and the sample
   tended to achieve a fractal distribution of particle sizes. The changes
   in other properties of the simulated granular material such as porosity
   and shear strength were also recorded, analyzed, and compared to the
   changes produced during another simulation where crushing was not a
   predominant feature.}},

Abstract = {{Because of recent medical advances, the number of children with chronic
   medical conditions who survive into adulthood has increased. The
   transition of care from pediatric to adult specialists and
   subspecialists has been rarely studied, yet it is an important aspect of
   care. To define issues in the pediatric patients at the University of
   Virginia, survey data was collected from adult nephrologists in the
   state. A total of 105 surveys were mailed to adult providers in
   Virginia. From 62 responses, 60\% of adult providers did not feel
   completely comfortable caring for a patient with a pediatric-specific
   diagnosis. To efficiently receive information on new patients, adult
   providers preferred an abbreviated medical summary or phone call from
   pediatric providers. Additionally, interviews were conducted with 6
   pediatric patients and their families. Patients reported a good grasp of
   their diagnosis and treatment, expressed an interest in learning
   chronic-illness coping strategies, and expressed interest in obtaining
   community-resource information. This study reiterated the need for
   additional insurance options for this at-risk population. Development of
   individualized transition plans and transition services are recommended
   to support young adult patients with chronic medical conditions as they
   transition into adulthood. (c) 2005 by the National Kidney Foundation,

   in the rat: modulation by a D1/D5, but not D2/D3, receptor antagonist}},
Journal = {{PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{182}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{297-304}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Rationale: Neurotensin (NT) has been implicated in some of the
   behavioral effects of psychostimulants. Thus, there is reason to think
   that NT may play a role in the reinstatement of cocaine seeking, and
   that it may do so via an interaction with dopamine (DA).
   Objectives: To assess (1) whether NT and an NT analog, D-TYR{[}11]NT,
   induce reinstatement of cocaine seeking; (2) whether the effects of NT
   receptor activation on reinstatement can be modulated by D1/D5 or D2/D3
   antagonists; (3) the specificity of the effects of NT receptor
   activation on the reinstatement of cocaine seeking.
   Methods: In Experiment 1, rats were initially trained to self-administer
   cocaine. Following a subsequent period of extinction training, they were
   tested for the reinstatement of cocaine seeking by NT or D-TYR{[}11]NT
   (15, 30 mu g i.c.v.). In Experiment 2, rats were pretreated with the
   D1/D5 antagonist, SCH 23390 (0.05, 0.10 mg/kg i.p.) or the D2/D3
   antagonist, raclopride (0.25, 0.50 mg/kg i.p.), prior to testing for
   reinstatement by D-TYR{[}11]NT (15 mu g i.c.v.). In Experiment 3, rats
   that had been trained to self-administer sucrose pellets were tested for
   the reinstatement of sucrose seeking by D-TYR{[}11]NT (15,30 mu g
   i.c.v.).
   Results: (1) Both NT and D-TYR{[}11]NT produced robust reinstatement of
   cocaine seeking; (2) the effect of the analog was attenuated by
   pretreatment with the D1/D5, but not D2/D3, receptor antagonist; (3) the
   analog, did not induce the reinstatement of sucrose seeking.
   Conclusions: The findings suggest that an interaction between NT and DA
   may contribute to the neurobiology of reinstatement in animals with a
   history of cocaine self-administration.}},

Abstract = {{A simple procedure for fabrication of gold films with nanorod arrays is
   described. The method is based on thermal evaporation of gold onto a
   porous alumina (PA) membrane used as a template. The gold films were
   obtained after removing the template and characterized using scanning
   electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and ultraviolet-visible
   spectrophotometry. The prepared gold films are composed of arrays of
   sharp (< 20 nm at apex) rod-shaped gold nanostructures. These structures
   closely follow the organization and distribution of pores of the PA
   template. The length of the gold nanostructures is estimated to range
   from 300 nm to more than 1000 nm. It was found that their length is
   influenced by the size of the pores in the PA and the temperature of the
   PA during gold evaporation. Spectrophotometric characterization shows
   that the prepared gold films exhibit a surface plasmon resonance
   absorption peak located between 525 and 540 nm.}},

Abstract = {{Polymorphisms in the mu-opioid receptor gene may potentially alter the

   polymorphism occurring at an allelic frequency of 12\% decreases the
   potency of opioid analgesics in humans. Interestingly, in carriers of
   this mutation, it appears to be possible to reach analgesia by
   increasing the opioid dose but side effects appear to occur less often
   despite the higher opioid dose. This suggests a broadened therapeutic
   range of the opioids. Other mutations of the mu-opioid receptor, for
   example three mutations within the third intracellular loop of the

Abstract = {{Objectives: The cochlea may be damaged by modern conventional
   radiotherapy (RT) for head and neck cancers when the ear is included in
   the radiation field. It is unclear however, if the retro-cochlear
   auditory pathways are affected as well, which has clinical significance
   in cochlear implantation. This study aims to investigate the integrity
   of the retrocochlear auditory pathways in patients who had received RT
   for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Study Design: Prospective study. Methods:
   Patients who were newly diagnosed with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and
   treated by RT alone were studied. Evoked response audiometry and PTAs
   were carried out prior to and after RT (at 3, 18, and 48 months postRT).
   In addition, evoked response audiometry was also performed during the
   3rd, 5th, and 7th week of RT. Waves 1 to 5, 1 to 3, and 3 to 5 latencies
   were measured. The values recorded during and postRT were compared with
   those recorded before RT. In addition, a subset of ears that
   demonstrated postRT sensorineural hearing loss were identified so that
   their respective wave I to 5 interwave latencies could be similarly
   compared. Wilcoxon signed ranks test was used in the statistical
   analysis. To confirm that the cochlea and internal auditory meatus
   receive significant doses of radiation, the RT treatment plans of nine
   other nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients treated by the same RT technique
   were analyzed to derive dose-volume histograms of these structures.
   Results. Twenty-seven patients (20 males and 7 females) with a mean age
   of 51.2 (range 36-75) years participated in the study. There was no
   statistically significant difference in waves 1 to 5, 1 to 3, and 3 to 5
   interwave latencies recorded during RT and postRT as compared with those
   recorded before RT (P > .05). Pre- and postRT wave I to 5 latencies of
   the 16 ears that had postRT hearing deterioration were also not
   statistically significant (P = .366). The mean radiation doses delivered
   to the cochlea and internal auditory meatus ranged from 24.1 to 62.2 Gy
   and 14.4 to 43.4 Gy, respectively. Conclusion: This study suggests in
   patients who have had RT for nasopharyngeal carcinoma, the
   retro-cochlear auditory pathways are functionally intact even in the
   longer term.}},

   (NF-kappa B), cAMP response element (CRE), CCAAT/enhancer binding
   protein (C/EBP), and activator protein (AP)-1. The cag PAI and OipA were
   involved in binding to NF-kappa B AP-1, CRE, and C/EBP sites. The cag
   PAI activated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Jun
   N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways; OipA activated the p38 pathway.
   Transfection of dominant negative G-protein confirmed roles for Raf,
   Rac1, and RhoA in IL-6 induction. Overall, the cag PAI-related IL-6
   signal transduction pathway involved the Ras/Raf/MEK1/2/ERK/AP-1/CRE
   pathway and the JNK/AP-1/CRE pathway; the OipA-related pathway is
   p38/AP-1/CRE and both the cag PAI and OipA appear to be involved in the
   RhoA/Rac1/NF-kappa B pathway. Combination of different pathways by the
   cag PAI and OipA will lead to the maximum IL-6 induction.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims In the last decades, the geographical location of
   the centre of origin of Quercus suber (cork oak), a strictly western
   Mediterranean oak species, has been the subject of controversy.
   Methods RFLP variation over the whole chloroplast DNA molecule and
   PCR-RFLPs over seven specific cpDNA fragments were analysed
   phylogeographically to reconstruct the evolutionary history of cork oak.
   Key Results Nine chlorotypes of the `suber' cpDNA lineage were
   identified throughout the species range. Using closely related
   Mediterranean oak species as outgroup, the chlorotypes showed a clear
   phylogeographical pattern of three groups corresponding to potential
   glacial refuges in Italy, North Africa and Iberia. The most ancestral
   and recent groups were observed in populations located in the eastern
   and western parts of the species range, respectively. Several unrelated
   chlorotypes of the `ilex' cpDNA lineage were also identified in specific
   western areas.
   Conclusions The results support a Middle-Eastern or a central
   Mediterranean origin for cork oak with subsequent westward colonization
   during the Tertiary Period, and suggest that the `ilex' chlorotype
   variation does not reflect entirely cytoplasmic introgression by Q. ilex
   but originated partly in Q. suber.}},

Abstract = {{This study quantified nonpoint source nitrogen (NPSN) sources and sinks
   across the 14,582 km(2) Neuse River Basin (NRB) located in North
   Carolina, to provide tabular data summaries and graphic overlay products
   to support the development of management approaches to best achieve
   established N reduction goals. First, a remote sensor derived, land
   cover classification was performed to support modeling needs. Modeling
   efforts included the development of a mass balance model to quantify
   potential N sources and sinks, followed by a precipitation event driven
   hydrologic model to effectively transport excess N across the landscape
   to individual stream reaches to support subsequent labeling of
   transported N values corresponding to source origin. Results indicated
   that agricultural land contributed 55 percent of the total annual NPS-N
   loadings, followed by forested land at 23 percent (background), and
   urban areas at 21 percent. Average annual N source contributions were
   quantified for agricultural (1.4 kg/ha), urban (1.2 kg/ha), and forested
   cover types (0.5 kg/ha). Nonpoint source-N contributions were greatest
   during the winter (40 percent), followed by spring (32 percent), summer
   (28 percent), and fall (0.3 percent). Seasonal total N loadings shifted
   from urban dominated and forest dominated sources during the winter, to
   agricultural sources in the spring and summer. A quantitative assessment
   of the significant NRB land use activities indicated that high (greater
   than 70 percent impervious) and medium (greater than 35 percent
   impervious) density urban development were the greatest contributors of
   NPS-N on a unit area basis (1.9 and 1.6 kg/ha/yr, respectively),
   followed by row crops and pasture/hay cover types (1.4 kg/ha/yr).}},

Abstract = {{This study analyzed the price integration for selected rice markets in
   Myanmar from April 2001 to May 2004. The purpose of this analysis was to
   understand market functioning for helping lawmakers further developing
   the rice market. In order to make a liberalization of the rice market
   there has to be certain specific market improvements in behaviors and
   relationships between central and local rice markets.
   The Autorgressive Distributed Lag model establishes existence of a
   long-run integration between pairs of markets. This indicates the
   influence of the Yangon Central Market price in the long-run to local
   markets. Error Correction Model results show the lack of short-run
   integration even though market segmentation does not exist. Insufficient
   transportation and communication facilities, lack of price transparency,
   and improper supporting services of middlemen cause inefficient price
   adjustment between the markets in the short-run. But, several markets
   show a significant time lag. The scope of improvement in market
   performance is ample. Privatization process in this market will face
   major challenges unless this situation is corrected.}},

Abstract = {{Members of the Aamjiwnaang First Nation community near Sarnia, Ontario,
   Canada, voiced concerns that there appeared to be fewer male children in
   their community in recent years. In response to these concerns, we
   assessed the sex ratio (proportion of male births) of the Aamjiwnaang
   First Nation over the period 1984-2003 as part of a community-based
   participatory research project. The trend in the proportion of male live
   births of the Aamjiwnaang First Nation has been declining continuously
   from the early 1990s to 2003, from an apparently stable sex ratio prior
   to this time. The proportion of male births (m) showed a statistically
   significant decline over the most recent 10-year period (1994-2003) (m =
   0.412, p = 0.008) with the most pronounced decrease observed during the
   most recent 5 years (1999-2003) (m = 0.348, p = 0.006). Numerous factors
   have been associated with a decrease in the proportion of male births in
   a population, including a number of environmental and occupational
   chemical exposures. This community is located within the Great Lakes St.
   Clair River Area of Concern and is situated immediately adjacent to
   several large petrochemical, polymer, and chemical industrial plants.
   Although there are several potential factors that could be contributing
   to the observed decrease in sex ratio of the Aamjiwnaang First Nation,
   the close proximity of this community to a large aggregation of
   industries and potential exposures to compounds that may influence sex
   ratios warrants further assessment into the types of chemical exposures
   for this population. A community health survey is currently under way to
   gather more information about the health of the Aamjiwnaang community
   and to provide additional information about the factors that could be
   contributing to the observed decrease in the proportion of male births
   in recent years.}},

Abstract = {{Theories of firm growth suggest that managers must resolve sequential
   crises at key stages. Explicit in these models is the accumulation of
   resources, including knowledge, which must be applied and (re)configured
   in order to create new structures and systems in order to overcome the
   crises at each stage. What these models do not provide is an
   understanding of how, or why, particular knowledge resources are
   considered salient, how knowledge is applied, and how changes to systems
   of application are caused. By re-conceptualizing knowledge not as a
   resource, but as an activity, this provides an alternative perspective
   on growth models. This research, conducted in three case study SMEs, and
   using Activity Theory as a methodological framework, examines how the
   case companies managed transition and innovation in organizational
   systems in order to resolve specific crises and facilitate growth. The
   findings indicate that rather than sequential crises, these firms were
   dealing with a number of crises concurrently, and solutions were
   significantly dependent on existing experience and systems of
   organising, manager's perception of the crises, and access to relevant
   knowledge. In these firms, growth was dependent on idiosyncratic
   solutions rather than on any prescriptive approach suggested by
   traditional growth models. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We examined nesting by seven native bird species in Illinois wetland
   habitats containing native cattail (Typha spp.) and non-native purple
   loosestrife, (Lythrum salicaria) as nesting substrates in 2000 and 2001.
   Over the two seasons, we found 146 nests of seven species: I 11 in
   cattail and 35 in purple loosestrife. Marsh wrens (Cistothorus
   palustris) nested in cattail (11 nests) but not in loosestrife in either
   year. Common grackles (Quiscalus quiscula) nested predominantly in
   cattail (63 in cattail vs. I in loosestrife). Only red-winged blackbirds
   (Agelaius phoeniceus) nested extensively in both cattail (37 nests) and
   loosestrife (30 nests). Individual nests of four bird species were found
   only in loosestrife. First-egg dates and peak nesting activity of
   red-winged blackbirds were almost three weeks later in loosestrife than
   in cattail. Despite the difference in nesting dates, daily survival
   rates of red-winged blackbird nests were similar in the two nesting
   substrates in both years. One wetland was burned in 2001, nearly
   eliminating cattail but not loosestrife as an early-season nesting
   substrate at the site; after the burn, red-winged blackbirds nested
   later in loosestrife in 2001, as they had done in 2000. At the burned
   site where loosestrife was the only available nesting substrate, marsh
   wrens were absent in 2001, although they had nested in cattail at that
   site in 2000. Our results suggest that wetlands dominated by purple
   loosestrife are not adequate breeding habitats for marsh wrens and
   common grackles. Habitats with a mixture of cattail and loosestrife
   supported successful nesting by red-winged blackbirds, albeit later in
   loosestrife.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To record mismatch negativity (MMN) to a visual stimulus
   fulfilling similar criteria to those of auditory MMN (A-MMN).
   Methods: Twelve normal adults were instructed to simultaneously listen
   to a story and to pay attention to a visual target. Three windmill
   patterns that differed in the number of vanes (standard, deviant, or
   target) were used as visual stimuli, and were randomly presented. To
   ensure endogeneity, standard and deviant stimuli were alternated. To
   vary differences between frequent (standard) and infrequent (deviant)
   stimuli, deviants were changed by modulating the number of vanes. To
   examine effects of physical features of the target stimulus on changes
   in detection, two target conditions were used. The deviant-related
   component (DRC) was obtained by subtracting event-related potentials
   (ERPs) to the deviant stimulus from those to the standard stimulus.
   Results: Seven subjects completed all phases of the experiment.
   Behavioral performances indicated that subjects' attention was directed
   by auditory context and identification of the target stimulus. Visual
   DRC appeared 150-300 ms after stimulus onset, and consisted of an early
   (DRN1) and a late (DRN2) component. Magnitude of deviancy from standard
   stimulus significantly influenced latency of DRN2 but not its magnitude,
   while changes in target stimulus affected latencies of both DRN1 and
   DRN2.
   Conclusions: Our DRCs satisfied criteria for A-MMN. In contrast to
   A-MMN, only latency of the DRC was associated with visual sensory
   discrimination and attentional reorienting.
   Significance: It is possible to record valid MMN to a visual stimulus,
   which allows the study of preattentive visual information processing.

Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{63}},

Abstract = {{Introduction Free fatty acids (FFAs) induce hepatic insulin resistance
   and enhance hepatic gluconeogenesis. Glucocorticoids (GCs) also
   stimulate hepatic gluconeogenesis. The aim of this study was to
   investigate whether the FFA-induced hepatic insulin resistance is
   mediated by increased activity of hepatic 11 beta-hydroxysteroid
   dehydrogenase type 1 (11 beta-HSD1), accompanied by elevated hepatic
   cortisol levels.
   Methods Following a 10-h overnight fast, six healthy male volunteers
   were investigated. A euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp was performed
   during lipid or saline infusion. To assess hepatic 11 beta-HSD1
   activity, plasma cortisol levels were measured after oral administration
   of cortisone acetate during lipid or saline infusion. In addition, 11
   beta-HSD activities were determined in vivo by calculating the urinary
   ratios of GC metabolites.
   Results Lipid infusion increased FFAs (5.41 +/- 1.00 vs. 0.48 +/- 0.20
   mmol/l; P < 0.005) and significantly increased insulin resistance
   {[}glucose infusion rate (GIR) 6.02 +/- 2.60 vs. 4.08 +/- 2.15
   mg/kg/min; P < 0.005]. After lipid and saline infusions no changes in 11
   beta-HSD1 activity were found, neither by changes in cortisone acetate
   to cortisol conversion nor by differences in urinary free cortisol (UFF)
   or cortisone (UFE), 5 beta-tetrahydrocortisol (THF), 5 alpha-THF,
   cortisone (THE), UFF/UFE and (5 alpha-THF + THF)/THE ratios.
   Conclusions We found no change in hepatic and whole-body 11 beta-HSD1
   activity during acute FFA-induced insulin resistance. Further studies
   are necessary to clarify whether 11 beta-HSD1 in muscle and adipose
   tissue is influenced by FFAs and whether 11 beta-HSD1 is involved in
   other conditions of insulin resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Genome interrelationship in the genus Eleusine (Poaceae) has always been
   a matter of considerable interest for plant breeders whose major
   objective was to attain genetic improvement in E. coracana (finger
   millet), an important crop of Africa and south Asia. E. coracana and E.
   africana are the two major amphidiploid species of Eleusine with AABB
   genome (2n=4x=36). In attempt to identify the A and B genome donor
   species, heteroploid crosses were made involving these two tetraploid
   species and four diploid species viz. E. intermdia, E. indica, E.
   floccifolia, E. tristachya (all with 2n=2x=18). The resultant F, hybrids
   were investigated for cytomorphological details. Male meiosis studies in
   pollen mother cells showed regular occurrence of expected 9II+9I at
   diakinesis/metaphase I in majority of the cells indicating the existence
   of complete and/or partial homology among crossing parents. The
   occurrence of occasional quadrivalents had apparently no bearing on the
   course of meiosis owing to their scant number. Anaphase I and II were
   characterized by unequal distribution and micronuclei leading to drastic
   reduction in pollen stainability (2-8\%) and complete seed seterlity.
   Our observations suggest that E. indica with AA genome is the pivotal
   donor species in the evolution of E. africana and E. coracana while E.
   intermedia (A(im)A(im)) and E. tristachya (A(t)A(t)) belong to A genomic
   group of diploid Eleusines. Further these three species form a close
   genetic assemblage within the genus Eleusine. The assumption that
   E.floccifolia is a definite B genome donor species is now widely
   accepted while E. tristachya might also be a candidate for BB genome is
   completely ruled out there by leaving the question wide open regarding
   identity of the other B genome donor species, if any.}},

Abstract = {{Hepatic uptake of propionyl-L-carnitine (PLC) and L-carnitine (LC) was
   assessed with the impulse-response technique in the single-pass perfused
   rat liver. The experiments involved a rapid injection (impulse) of a
   mixture of the radiolabeled test compound (PLC or LC) and a reference
   compound (sucrose) into portal vein inflow and collection and
   radiochemical analysis (response) of the venous outflowing perfusate
   samples. The impulse injection was made in the presence of increasing
   unlabeled background concentrations of PLC (0-50 mu M) or LC (50-500 mu
   M) perfusing the liver. The hepatic uptake was minimal or negligible for
   LC, whereas the hepatic influx clearance was found to be low (0.095 ml/s
   equivalent to 5.7 ml/min) for PLC relative to the perfusate flow rate
   (30 ml/min). When background concentrations of PLC were increased (from
   1-50 mu M), the influx clearance was reduced in a
   concentration-dependent behavior, indicating partial saturation of the
   entry of compound into hepatocytes. PLC was taken up into hepatocytes
   via a unidirectional transport process with negligible efflux. The
   hepatic uptake of PLC was significantly reduced in the presence of
   unlabeled LC (500 mu M), indicating an inhibition of the sinusoidal
   membrane transport of PLC by LC. The study showed the sinusoidal
   membrane is a permeability barrier to the entry of PLC and LC into
   hepatocytes, and it is the site of a common carrier-mediated transporter
   for both compounds.}},

Abstract = {{Experiment and simulation results of conventional transformer design
   have shown that there are considerable differences in the

   transferred voltages, depending on whether it is from primary to
   secondary or vice versa. Dryformer is a new technological advance of dry
   power transformer, which is constructed from XLPE insulated high voltage
   cables as its winding, and is designed to provide a direct link between
   ultimate customers and transmission systems in one step transformation

   circuits. This paper presents the application of a high frequency model
   for the study of transient surge voltage transfer between the Dryformer
   circuits due to surges having various steepness, amplitude and duration
   characteristics, which are expected in practise. The model is based on
   the creation of an RLCG network that gives the same admittance function

   been verified by comparing the model predictions with experimentally
   obtained voltage transfer function. The model is successfully applied in

Abstract = {{Postoperative complications in patients with obstructive jaundice remain
   increased when associated with, endotoxemia and the inflammatory
   response due to gut barrier failure. Administration of glutamine has
   been proposed to maintain the integrity of the gut mucosa and thus
   reduce bacterial translocation (BT), but the effects of this
   pretreatment on apoptosis and histologic morphology of various organs
   affected by BT in obstructive jaundice have not been studied. We
   therefore studied the effects of oral glutamine supplementation on
   endotoxemia, BT, liver and terminal ileal morphology, and apoptosis in
   an experimental model of obstructive jaundice. A total of 60 male Wistar
   rats were randomly divided into four groups of 15 each:, I, controls;
   II, sham-operated; III, bile duct ligation (BDL); IV, BDL + glutamine
   (4.5 g/kg/day in drinking water). Ileal samples for histology, DNA and
   protein content, liver biopsies, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) for
   culture, and portal and systemic blood samples for endotoxin
   measurements were obtained 10 days later. Compared to the controls, a
   significant increase in contaminated MLN and liver samples and increased
   endotoxemia were noted in group III (p < 0.01) but were significantly
   reduced in group IV (p < 0.05). Group IV also had a significantly higher
   number of mitoses per crypt (M/c) (p < 0.05), less apoptotic body counts
   (ABCs) (p < 0.05), and a higher DNA content than did group III (p <
   0.05). Liver biopsies from group III displayed typical changes of large
   duct obstruction that significantly improved after glutamine treatment,
   with decreased ductular proliferation. We concluded that supplementation
   of oral glutamine in the presence of obstructive jaundice ameliorates
   BT, endotoxemia, and apoptosis and improves the ileal and liver
   histology.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: We evaluated the effects of warmed, humidified CO2 and
   anti-inflammatory agents on the local and systemic cytokine response
   after laparoscopic nephrectomy.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 15 pigs were randomized to undergo
   standard laparoscopic nephrectomy, laparoscopic nephrectomy with warmed,
   humidified CO2 gas or laparoscopic nephrectomy with perioperative
   administration of intravenous dexamethasone and oral rofecoxib. At
   baseline, and 1, 4, 24 and 48 hours after surgery duplicate blood and
   peritoneal samples were drawn to analyze cortisol, glucose, tumor
   necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1 beta and IL-6 via
   a microassay technique. Body temperature was determined at operation,
   intraoperatively and 1 hour postoperatively. Surgical parameters,
   including operative time, gas volume used and blood loss, were recorded.
   Results: Pigs in the warmed, humidified CO2 and anti-inflammatory arms
   maintained higher intraoperative and postoperative core body
   temperatures than controls. Warmed, humidified CO2 did not affect
   peritoneal or systemic cytokine levels. Peak peritoneal TNF-alpha levels
   in the anti-inflammatory group were significantly higher than in
   controls at 4 hours. Considerably higher serum TNF-a levels in the
   anti-inflammatory group were observed at 48 hours. Peritoneal IL-1 beta
   and IL-6 levels in the anti-inflammatory group remained similar to those
   in controls, while serum levels were noticeably lower. There was no
   observable difference in serum cortisol or the glucose response to
   laparoscopic nephrectomy among the groups.
   Conclusions: While preserving core body temperature, humidified, warmed
   CO2 did not affect local or systemic trends of pro-inflammatory
   mediators. The administration of perioperative anti-inflammatory agents
   produced conflicting local and systemic cytokine response of uncertain
   clinical significance.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. The purpose of this study was to identify a new Pseudomonas
   protease and determine its possible role in keratitis.
   METHODS. Concentrated culture supernatants of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa
   strains PA103 and ATCC 19660 were analyzed by zymography. P. aeruginosa
   small protease (PASP) was purified from strain PA103, and modified
   elastase B (LasB) was purified from strain ATCC 19660. SDS-PAGE and
   Western blot analysis were performed on purified PASP and modified LasB.
   PASP was further analyzed by mass spectrometry and amino-terminal
   sequencing. The Pasp gene was cloned and expressed, affinity-purified in
   denatured form from inclusion bodies, and refolded by removal of the
   denaturant. Purified recombinant PASP was analyzed by zymography for
   protease activity. PASP and heat-inactivated PASP were injected into
   rabbit corneas, and the corneas were monitored for erosions caused by
   protease activity.
   RESULTS. Each strain produced a protease with a molecular mass of 80 kDa
   on zymograms. LasB antiserum identified the ATCC 19660 protease as
   modified LasB. Mass spectrometry defined the PA103 protease as having a
   molecular mass of 18.5 kDa. Amino-terminal sequencing and analysis of
   the P. aeruginosa genome sequence determined that the PA103 Pasp gene
   sequence was >99\% identical with the PA0423 sequence of strain PAO1.
   Recombinant PASP was proteolytic, with a zymogram mass of 50 kDa. PASP
   purified from PA103 produced extensive corneal epithelial erosions,
   whereas heat-inactivated PASP produced no erosions.
   CONCLUSIONS. PASP is a protease that has not been previously identified.
   It causes corneal epithelial erosions, indicating its likely activity as
   a virulence-promoting factor in Pseudomonas keratitis.}},

Abstract = {{Thin films of ion-conducting polyethylene oxide (PEO) are prepared as a
   model system for solid polymer electrolytes. Plane-parallel capacitance
   structures of the type Al-PEO-Al (Metal-Insulator-Metal, MIM) with
   blocking electrodes are produced. In the short time range t <= 1 s after
   the application of an external field, an ionic space-charge polarization
   with an exponential time dependence prevails. In the long time range the
   samples exhibit a Kohlrausch behavior of the polarization current, i.e.,
   j proportional to t(-alpha). This time dependence can be explained by
   image charges in the electrodes which attract the mobile ions. This
   attraction of ions is responsible for the static and the dynamic
   behavior of the system. The remanent polarization appearing in
   hysteresis measurements is an affirmation of the presence of these image
   charges. Computer simulations of a three-dimensional hopping model yield
   qualitatively the same results. Here the attraction of ions at the
   electrodes due to the image charges can be observed, as well as the
   experimentally determined t(-alpha) currents and the hysteresis of the
   polarization. This behavior cannot be simulated with a standard
   continuum model. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics.}},

Abstract = {{Iris fulva and I. brevicaulis are long-lived plant species known to
   hybridize where they coexist in nature. Year-to-year survival
   contributes significantly to overall fitness for both species and their
   hybrid derivatives, and differences in hybrid survivability may have
   important consequences to interspecific gene flow in nature. We examined
   the genetic architecture of long-term survivorship of reciprocal
   backcross I. fulva x I. brevicaulis hybrids in a common-garden,
   greenhouse environment. Differences in mortality were found between the
   two backcross (BC1) hybrid classes, with hybrids crossed toward I. fulva
   (BCIF) revealing twice the mortality of those hybrids backcrossed toward
   I. brevicaulis (BCIB). Using genomic scans on two separate genetic
   linkage maps derived from the reciprocal hybrid populations, we found
   that hybrid survivorship is influenced by several genetic regions.
   Multiple interval mapping (MIM) revealed four quantitative trait loci
   (QTLs) in BCIF hybrids that were significantly associated with
   survivorship. Introgressed I. brevicaulis DNA increased survivorship at
   three of the four QTLs. For the fourth QTL, introgressed I. brevicaulis
   DNA was associated with decreased survivorship. No QTLs were detected in
   BCIB hybrids; however, single-marker analysis revealed five unlinked
   loci that were significantly associated with survivorship. At all five
   markers, survivorship was positively associated with introgressed I.
   fulva DNA. The present findings have important implications for the
   evolutionary dynamics of naturally occurring hybrid zones. Regions of
   the genome that increase survivorship when in a heterozygous (i.e.,
   hybrid) state should have an increased likelihood of passing across
   species boundaries, whereas those that decrease survivorship will be
   less likely to introgress.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Treatment of hypertension in the elderly people reduces the
   risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Effective treatment
   often will require the use of two or more antihypertensive agents.
   Elderly people are at increased risk of adverse events from medication
   because of physiological changes in pharmacokinetics and
   pharmacodynamics, polypharmacy and drug interactions. They might not
   tolerate conventional add-on regimens of antihypertensives as a result.
   Objective: To investigate the use of the I-1-imidazoline receptor
   agonist moxonidine as an `add-on' agent in elderly patients with
   resistant hypertension.
   Methods: We investigated the safety and efficacy of moxonidine (200-400
   mu g) in a group of elderly patients whose blood pressure (BP) control
   remained poor despite treatment with two or more antihypertensives. BP
   was assessed by ambulatory BP monitoring with Spacelabs oscillometric
   equipment (Model 90207) before and after 6 weeks of treatment with
   moxonidine used as an `add-on' agent with the patients normal
   medication.
   Results: Following treatment with moxonidine, the mean daytime systolic
   BP fell from 169.2 to 153.8 mmHg, a significant reduction of 15.4 +/-
   8.9 mmHg (P = 0.003). The mean daytime diastolic BP fell from 91.6 to
   84.2 mmHg, a reduction of 7.4 +/- 5.8 mmHg (P = 0.017). For the
   night-time readings, the systolic BP fell from 151.1 to 141.2 mmHg, a
   reduction of 9.3 +/- 9.3 mmHg (P = 0.05). The corresponding diastolic
   fall in BP was not significant (77.9-74.7 mmHg). The 24 h-readings
   showed a significant reduction in the mean systolic BP from 163.0 to
   148.6 mmHg (P = 0.004). The mean diastolic BP also fell significantly
   from 87.2 to 80.2 mmHg (P = 0.013). Clinical BP readings also showed a
   significant reduction from 195.9 +/- 19.6 to 174 +/- 17.8 mmHg (P =
   0.002) and 103.6 +/- 9.5 to 99.0 +/- 12.4 mmHg (P = 0.013) for systolic
   and diastolic readings respectively. Moxonidine was well tolerated in 11
   of the14 patients.
   Conclusion: These results suggest that moxonidine might have a place as
   an `add-on' treatment in elderly patients whose hypertension is poorly
   controlled despite treatment with two or more antihypertensive agents.}},

Abstract = {{Calcareous skeletal elements (ossicles) isolated from the seastar,
   Pisaster giganteus, were characterized and tested as potential
   biocompatible substrates for cellular attachment. These ossicles lime a
   remarkably robust open-framework architecture with an interconnected
   network of ca. 10 pill diameter pores. Scanning electron and confocal
   microscopy was used to characterize the cell-substrate interaction. Cell
   culturing experiments revealed that the cells firmly attach to the
   ossicle surface, forming cell aggregates of several layers thick. The
   anchored cells extended to form `bridges' between the openings in the
   bicontinuous frame work and the degree of coverage increased its culture
   time progressed. Osteoblasts grown on the ossicles were found to be
   viable up to 32 days after initial seeding, as proven by assaying with
   AlamarBlue (TM) and FDA(1)P1 staining indicating the ossicle's potential
   as ail alternative highly effective tissue scaffold. Given the
   limitation in availability of this natural material. the results
   presented here should be seen as offering guidelines for future
   development of synthetic materials with physical and chemical properties
   strongly conducive to bone repair and restoration. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The poly(p-phenylene sulfide) (PPS) nonisothermal cold-crystallization
   behavior was investigated in a wide heating rate range. The techniques
   employed were the usual Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), and the
   less conventional FT-IR spectroscopy and Energy Dispersive X-ray
   Diffraction (EDXD). The low heating rates (Phi) explored by EDXD (0.1 K
   min(-1)) and FT-IR (0.5-10 K min(-1)) are contiguous and complementary
   to the DSC ones (5-30 K min(-1)). The crystallization temperature
   changes from 95 degrees C at Phi = 0.05 K min(-1) to 130 degrees C at
   Phi = 30 K min(-1). In such a wide temperature range the Kissinger model
   failed. The model is based on an Arrhenius temperature dependence of the
   crystallization rate and is widely employed to evaluate the activation
   energy of the crystallization process. The experimental results were
   satisfactorily fit by replacing in the Kissinger model the Arrhenius
   equation with the Vogel-Fulcher-Tamann function and fixing U{*} = 6.28 k
   J mol(-1), the activation energy needed for the chains movements,
   according to Hoffmann. The temperature at which the polymer chains are
   motionless (T-infinity = 42 degrees C) was found by fitting the
   experimental data. It appears to be reasonable in the light of our
   previously reported isothermal crystallization results, which indicated
   T-infinity = 48 degrees C. Moreover, at the lower heating rate, mostly
   explored by FT-IR, a secondary stepwise crystallization process was well
   evidenced. In first approximation, it contributes to about 17\% of the
   crystallinity reached by the sample. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The recently discovered anticancer drug Minerval (2-hydroxy-9-
   cis-octadecenoic acid) is a synthetic fatty acid that modifies the
   structure of the membrane. This restructuring facilitates the
   recruitment of protein kinase C (PKC) alpha to membranes and is
   associated with the antineoplastic activity of Minerval in cellular and
   animal models of cancer. Minerval is a derivative of oleic acid (OA)
   with an enhanced antiproliferative activity in human cancer cells and
   animal models of cancer, which is associated with PKC alpha activation
   and p21(CIP) overexpression. However, the signaling cascades involved in
   its pharmacological activity remain largely unknown. Here, we showed
   that this drug induced cell cycle arrest before entry into S phase,
   human lung adenocarcinoma (A549) cells accumulating in the G(0)/G(1)
   phase. This cell cycle arrest was associated with a marked decrease in
   the expression of E2F-1. This transcription factor activates several
   cell cycle-related genes, and, accordingly, the expression of certain
   cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) was markedly lower upon
   exposure to Minerval. The reduced availability of these kinase
   heterodimers was associated with reduced phosphorylation of the
   retinoblastoma protein (pRb) observed after drug treatment.
   Significantly, hypophosphorylated pRb remains bound to E2F-1 and
   maintains this transcription factor inactive. The modulation of these
   antiproliferative mechanisms by Minerval explains its anticancer
   potency, through a new therapeutic strategy that can be used to develop
   new antitumor drugs. On the other hand, apoptosis did not seem to be
   involved in its pharmacological mechanism. Interestingly, whereas the
   changes induced by OA were only modest, they may reflect the beneficial
   effects of high olive oil intake against cancer.}},
