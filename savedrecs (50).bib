Abstract = {{We describe a method for off-line analysis of spectra measured by
   two-dimensional angular correlation of annihilation radiation (2D-ACAR)
   positron spectroscopy. The method takes into account, at all its stages,
   two salient data features: the piecewise constant discretization of the
   2D physical momentum distribution into square pixels, performed by the
   setup, and the occurrence of a characteristic 2D projected symmetry of
   the positron-electron pair momentum distribution. Several validating
   criteria are derived which secure significantly increased reliability of
   the output.
   The method is tested on 2D-ACAR spectra measured on (R)Ba2Cu3O7-delta
   (R123; R = Y, Dy) single crystals. It resolves ridge Fermi surfaces (Fs)
   up to 3rd Umklapp components on both kinds of R123 spectra. Moreover, on
   a c-axis-projected Y123 spectrum, measured at 300 K, it resolves a small
   but clear signature of the pillbox Fs at the S point of the first
   Brillouin zone as well.}},

Abstract = {{A Fourier analysis of the linear and quadratic N + 1 and N + 2
   Petrov-Gaterkin finite element methods applied to the one-dimensional
   transient convective-diffusion equation is performed. The results show
   that a priori optimization of the N + 1 method is not possible because
   dissipative errors are introduced as dispersive errors are reduced (any
   optimization is subjective). However, a priori optimization of the N + 2
   Petrov-Galerkin method is possible because the reduction of dispersion
   errors can be accomplished without the addition of artificial
   dissipation.
   The Spectrally Weighted Average Phase Error Method (SWAPEM) for the
   optimization of the N + 2 Petrov-Galerkin method is introduced, in which
   the N + 2 weighting parameter is chosen at each time step to minimize
   the integral over wave number of the phase error of Fourier modes,
   weighted by the frequency content of the global solution at the previous
   time step (obtained via FFT). The method is dynamic, and general in that
   the dependence of the weighting parameter on the solution waveform is
   accounted for. Optimal values predicted by the method are in excellent
   agreement with those suggested by the numerical experimentation of
   others. Simulations of the pure convective transport of a Gaussian plume
   and a triangle wave are discussed to illustrate the effectiveness of the
   method.}},

Abstract = {{This paper shows the results obtained from an integrated study (geology,
   biostratigraphy and geochemistry) carried out on the Miocene sedimentary
   deposits in Central Italy in order to define the timing of the
   sedimentary basin evolution. This paper deals also with the causes of
   the unconformities recorded in these basins. In the Miocene deposits of
   the Latina Valley and the Ernici-Simbruini Mts. several unconformities
   which distinguish different stratigraphic sequences have been recognized
   (D-0, D-1, D-2, D-3 and D-4). For each unconformity a general
   description together with a geodynamical significance is provided. In
   particular, D-0 unconformity appears to be related to a regional
   tectonic event (Adria-Europe collision). As a consequence, the Adria
   lithosphere folded and the area underwent a regional erosive event. D-1,
   D-2 and D-3 unconformities have had a more local tectonic control since
   they represent the stratigraphic record of the migration of the
   Apennines thrust belt/foredeep system. D-1 and D-2 unconformities are
   related to the late Tortonian foredeep stage, whereas D-3 is linked to
   the early Messinian piggy-back stage. Moreover, the D-4 unconformity,
   which took place during the Messinian piggy-back stage, is strictly
   linked to the sea-level drop of the Messinian salinity crisis.
   In this paper the genesis and evolution of a late Tortonian foreland
   basin is also stressed (Latina Valley foredeep basin). Finally, taking
   into account sequence boundaries, nannofossil biostratigraphy and
   geochemistry isotopic data, a comparison with the curve of the 3rd order
   of the relative coastal onlap (Haq et al., 1988) has been attempted in
   order to distinguish the unconformities controlled either by tectonic or
   eustatic processes.}},

Abstract = {{The volume-of-fluid (VOF) method is a simple and robust technique for
   simulating free surface flows with large deformations and intersecting

   include the viscous component of the normal stress in the liquid phase
   and in a limited manner, to allow the pressure in the vapour phase to
   vary. Included are sample computations that show the accuracy of added
   third-order-accurate differencing schemes for the convective terms in
   the Navier-Stokes equation (NSE), the viscous terms in the normal stress
   at the interface and the solution of potential flow in the vapour phase
   coupled with the solution of the NSE in the liquid phase. With these
   modifications we show that the VOF method can accurately predict the
   instability of a thin viscous sheet flowing through a stagnant vapour
   phase.}},

Abstract = {{Rabaul Caldera is the most recently active (1937-1943) of four adjoining
   volcanic centres aligned north-south through the northern extremity of
   eastern New Britain. Geological mapping after the 1983-1985 Rabaul
   seismic and deformation crisis has partially revealed a long and complex
   eruption history dominated by numerous explosive eruptions, the largest
   accompanied by caldera collapse. The oldest exposed eruptives are the
   basaltic pre-caldera cone Tovanumbatir Lavas K/Ar dated at 0.5 Ma. The
   dacitic Rabaul Quarry Lavas exposed in the caldera wall and K/Ar dated
   at 0.19 Ma, are overlain by a sequence of dacitic and andesitic
   pyroclastic flow and fall deposits. Uplifted coral reef limestones,
   interbedded within the pyroclastic sequence on the northeast coast,
   suggest that explosive eruptions in the Rabaul area had commenced prior
   to the 0.125 Ma last interglacial high sea level stand, The pyroclastic
   sequence includes the large Boroi Ignimbrites and Malaguna Pyroclastics
   both Ar-40/Ar-39 dated at about 0.1 Ma, and the Barge Tunnel Ignimbrite
   Ar-40/Ar-39 dated at around 0.04 Ma. Few reliable ages exist for the
   many younger eruptives, These include Holocene ignimbrites of the latest
   caldera-forming eruptions - the Raluan Pyroclastics variously dated
   (C-14) at either about 3500 or 7000 yr B.P., and the ca. 1400 yr B.P.
   Rabaul Pyroclastics. At least eight intracaldera eruptions have occurred
   since the 1400 yr B.P. collapse, building small pyroclastic and lava
   cones within the caldera.
   A major erosional episode is evident as a widespread unconformity in the
   upper pyroclastic stratigraphy at Rabaul. Lacking relevant radiometric
   ages, this episode is assumed to have occurred during last glaciation
   low sea levels and is here arbitarily dated at ca. ?20 ka. At least
   five, possibly nine, significant ignimbrite eruptions have occurred at
   Rabaul during the last ?20 ka. The new eruptive history differs
   considerably from that previously published, which considered ignimbrite
   eruption and caldera collapse to have first occurred at 3500 yr B.P.
   Rabaul volcanism has been dominated by two main types: (a) basaltic and
   basaltic andesite cone building eruptions; and (b) dacitic, and rarely
   andesitic or rhyolitic, plinian/ignimbrite eruptions of both high- and
   low-aspect ratio types. The 1400 yr B.P. Rabaul Ignimbrite is a type
   example of a low-aspect ratio, high-energy, and potentially very
   damaging eruption. Fine vitric ash deposits, common in the Rabaul
   pyroclastic sequence, demonstrate the frequent modification of eruptions
   by external water probably related to early caldera lakes or bays.
   Interbedding of these fine ashes with plinian pumice lapilli beds
   suggests that many early eruptions occurred from multiple vents, located
   in both wet and dry areas.}},

Abstract = {{Mayor Island is a peralkaline rhyolitic caldera volcano characterised by
   numerous, sector-confined pyroclastic deposits, together with lavas

   C-14 ka to 64 ka) from Okataina and Taupo volcanic centres in the nearby
   Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ) have been identified on the island. These
   `'foreign'' TVZ tephras provide marker planes to correlate activity in
   different sectors of Mayor Island volcano, and refine an eruptive
   chronology. At least seventeen pyroclastic eruptions and fourteen
   lava-producing events (including multiple, shield-forming events) have
   occurred in the past ca. 64 ka. Age controls provided by the
   calc-alkaline tephras confirm the extremely local dispersal

   interaction, the excitation intensity dependence of the Kerr
   nonlinearity depends on the two-dimensional density n of CTEs as n(3/2),
   and the dependence of the CW nonlinear polarization on the laser field

   These observations suggest that the anemones are not obtaining MAAs from
   the algae, but probably from an exogenous source. By contrast, S.
   microadriaticum in culture releases three MAAs to the culture medium.
   Aposymbiotic scyphistomae of C. xamachana produced no MAAs even when

Abstract = {{A purified model in vitro mucus system containing primarily the large,
   400 kDa glycoprotein fraction of mucus has been developed for use in
   drug permeability and drug binding studies. The effect of protein
   solutions, either bovine serum albumin (BSA) or purified porcine gastric
   mucus, on the permeability behavior of five drugs was studied. The drugs
   chosen were isoniazid, pentamidine, rifampicin, p-aminosalicylic acid,
   and pyrazinamide, all of which can be potentially delivered as pulmonary
   aerosols. BSA was included in the permeability studies for comparison
   with previously obtained data regarding their binding behaviors to mucin
   relative to BSA. A custom membrane holder with a 3 mm chamber for mucin
   or other solutions was used in a Side-Bi-Side(R) diffusion apparatus to
   measure drug permeation through the solutions. Apparent permeability
   coefficients were calculated for each barrier in the series barrier
   system, with a protein solution being one of the barriers. The protein
   solutions significantly reduced the permeability of the drugs studied
   compared with their permeability through blank buffer solution. Both the
   lag time and the steady-state flux of the compounds were altered in the
   presence of protein indicating that there is more than protein binding
   affecting permeability. Such reductions in permeability coefficients
   need to be considered for all compounds that must traverse any mucosal
   surface prior to absorption or action.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous studies have postulated that bacteria which reside in a biofilm
   differ from planktonic bacteria. These differences are thought to affect
   biofilm permeability and, indirectly, the susceptibility of biofilm
   bacteria to antibacterial agents. In this study fluorescence recovery
   after photobleaching (FRAP) was used to monitor the diffusion and
   binding characteristics of a set of size fractionated fluorescein
   isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated dextrans over small areas (ca. 10 mu m)
   in bacterial biofilms. From these measurements it was straightforward to
   calculate apparent diffusion rates. Initial studies on the concentration
   dependence of dextran interaction with planktonic bacteria showed that
   no irreversible interaction was occurring, however, anomalous faster
   than free solution diffusion rates were obtained. This phenomenon was
   modelled using novel analytical and numerical methods which incorporate
   reversible binding with associated fluorescence changes. Apparent
   diffusion rates measured in biofilms were highly dependent on biofilm
   preparation. Sucrose starved biofilms produced an apparent slow-down of
   two- to fivefold depending on dextran molecular mass and location within
   the biofilm, indicating that diffusion within the biofilm is hindered.
   Sucrose supplemented biofilms produced apparent diffusion rates close to
   those in free solution, suggesting less hindered diffusion. Ex vivo
   plaque showed diffusion and binding similar to the sucrose supplemented
   biofilms. The FRAP approach provides a fast and convenient method for
   determining diffusion rates over small areas within bacterial biofilms.
   This study reinforces the importance of considering the influence of
   reversible binding and associated fluorescence changes, as these may
   have a marked effect on the measured apparent diffusion rate.}},

Abstract = {{We measure the diffusion of ethane in very large crystals of the
   molecular sieve AIPO(4)-5 (provided by M. Davis) using pulsed field
   gradient (PFG) NMR. Thanks to the large crystal size and the long
   longitudinal relaxation time, the mean square displacement could be
   monitored over times that arranged over an order of magnitude. The mean
   square displacement was proportional to the square root of time,
   providing strong evidence that the ethane molecules are moving in a
   single file, i.e. they are unable to pass each other. This is the first
   direct experimental evidence for single-file diffusive motion - a
   phenomenon that is probably widely prevalent in both industrial
   catalytic and biological systems.}},

Abstract = {{FREE radical-mediated damage to cultured cortical neurons was induced by
   a 24 h exposure to Fe2+ (30 mu M) or an inhibitor of
   gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, L-buthionine-{[}S,R]-sulfoximine
   (BSO, 1 mM). As expected, neuronal death was blocked by inclusion of the
   free radical scavenger trolox during the Fe2+ or BSO exposure. However,
   unexpectedly, pretreatment of the cultures with BDNF or IGF-I markedly
   potentiated neuronal death. This growth factor-potentiated death was
   still blocked by trolox, but was insensitive to glutamate antagonists.
   Concurrent addition of cycloheximide with the growth factors prevented
   injury potentiation. Present findings suggest that growth factors may
   increase free radical-induced neuronal death by mechanisms dependent
   upon protein synthesis.}},

Abstract = {{A series of taxol- and taxotere-resistant J774.2 cell lines has been
   characterized with respect to altered expression of beta-tubulin, the
   cellular target for these drugs, Vertebrates have six classes of
   beta-tubulin isotypes, each displaying a distinct pattern of expression.
   Although the functional significance of multiple beta-tubulins has not
   been fully defined, there is evidence that the individual isotypes
   contribute to differences in microtubule dynamics and drug binding. To
   determine if alterations in the expression of beta-tubulin isotypes play
   a role in taxol resistance, a PCR-based methodology was developed that
   permits highly specific amplification of each of the six known murine
   beta-tubulin isotypes. Two isotypes, M beta 5 and M beta 3, were
   expressed abundantly in the drug-sensitive parental J774.2 cells.
   Although expressed at an extremely low level in the parental cells,
   expression of the M beta 2 isotype was increased 21-fold (<0.005) in the
   cell line most resistant to taxol, These findings suggest that a cell
   can alter its relative tubulin isotype composition in response to an
   external stress and specifically imply that altered expression of M beta
   2, the class II beta-tubulin isotype, may contribute to the development
   of high resistance to taxol.}},

Abstract = {{Ecto-5'-nucleotidase (NT, CD73) is a purine salvage-pathway enzyme
   located on the surface of various cell types, including subsets of human
   lymphocytes and certain leukemias and lymphomas. In addition to purine
   salvage, NT has proposed roles in lymphocyte maturation and activation,
   and its expression has been associated with the resistance of some tumor
   cell lines to chemotherapeutic agents. To better understand the
   regulation of NT gene expression in normal lymphocyte development and
   the elevated expression seen in some drug-resistant tumor cell lines, we
   isolated NT genomic clones containing the promoter region. The genomic
   DNA upstream from the NT start codon is high in G+C content, with one
   cAMP-responsive element and five consensus Sp-1 binding sites, but no
   TATAA box. RNase protection assays identified a cluster of potential
   transcription start points (tsp). One tsp, at -63 bp relative to the
   start codon, was confirmed as authentic by 5'-RACE (rapid amplification
   of cDNA ends) cloning. Transient transfection experiments utilizing luc
   as a reporter gene have demonstrated that a 155-bp NT genomic DNA
   segment inclusive of the tsp functions as a promoter in both NT+ (WI-L2
   and MG) and NT- (Jurkat, Hela and Raji) cell lines. The addition of
   5'-flanking sequences extending as far as -1.9 kb did not confer
   cell-type-specific expression to the core promoter, However, nuclear
   run-on analysis of nascent NT transcripts suggested that differential
   transcription initiation is at least partially responsible for the
   regulation of NT expression. Thus, additional information. is necessary,
   either at the chromatin level, or within elements outside of the
   promoter region, to direct tissue-specific expression of NT.}},

Abstract = {{The spin lattice T-l and phase memory T-M relaxation times were measured

   covalently to horse heart cytochrome c below 80 K for oxidized (Fe3+)
   and reduced (Fe2+) samples. T-l decreases on heating and below 10 K is
   governed by the direct relaxation process for the reduced sample. The
   spin-lattice relaxation is enhanced by a cross-relaxation to Fe3+ in an
   oxidized sample. In the T-M temperature dependence an unusual deep
   minimum appears at about 25 K. This resonance type effect which vanishes
   completely for the reduced sample is due to a coupling to the Fe3+
   spins. The spin-lattice relaxation rate of Fe3+ is comparable to the T-M
   of nitroxide at low temperature producing a minimum in T-M when the T-l
   value corresponds to the spin packet width of excited spins.}},

   an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The core sequence for the
   DNA-protein complex formation, 5'-CAAAAATGTC-3', was found to be located

Abstract = {{Models of ecological communities, including coevolved patterns of
   resource use among sympatric species (for example, `resource
   partitioning'), are poor or inadequate representations of natural
   systems despite intense theoretical effort for many years. Some of these
   difficulties are due to a failure to recognize the necessary conditions
   for community patterns to develop, which are largely controlled by the
   dynamic characteristics of individual species. In continental bird
   communities - examples of which are considered here - these necessary
   conditions often will not be met owing to the mobility of most species.
   Here I document the degrees to which the large-scale dynamics (over
   hundreds of km) of individual bird species are expressed in community
   terms in five forest-habitat types throughout the year. These data
   demonstrate that continental bird communities are so dynamic that the
   conditions for the development of definite structure are unlikely to be
   met in either proximate or evolutionary time. The failure of community
   theories to account for and predict structure probably reflects too much
   concentration on mechanisms at inappropriate spatial scales.}},

Abstract = {{AGENTS that interfere with the toxic effects of beta-amyloid protein may
   be therapeutically useful against Alzheimer's disease. We reported
   recently that several sulphated glycosaminoglycans and sulphonated dyes
   attenuate the toxic effects of beta-amyloid fragments beta 25-35 and
   beta 1-40 in two clonal cell lines. We now demonstrate that this
   protective effect is due to interference with beta-amyloid cell
   association rather than effects on beta-amyloid structure. Using an
   enzyme-linked immunoabsorbance assay to detect cell-associated beta
   1-40, we found in a range of compounds a strong correlation between
   inhibition of HeLa cell association of beta 1-40 and attenuation of
   cellular toxicity as measured by inhibition of
   3-{[}4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
   reduction. In contrast, effects on peptide structure, as measured by
   Congo red binding, were generally inconsistent with the attenuating
   effects of the compounds on cellular toxicity. These results suggest
   that by binding beta-amyloid these agents prevent its interaction with
   cells.}},

   DNA replication in vivo at 36\% of the efficiency of wild-type Tus,

   arrest activity did not correlate with changes in the stability of the

   stable protein-DNA complex than wild-type Tus (t(1/2) of 178 versus 149
   min, respectively) and TusP42 had a 9-min half-life, yet these two
   mutants showed identical efficiencies for replication arrest. When
   tested in vitro using a helicase assay or an oriC replication system, we
   observed a general, but imperfect, correlation between the in vivo and

Abstract = {{Background. In patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM)
   whose treatment results in nearly normal mean plasma glucose
   concentrations, an unawareness of hypoglycemia can develop, and such
   patients are at increased risk for seizures and coma. We tested the
   hypothesis that during hypoglycemia, these patients would have normal
   glucose uptake in the brain and that consequently no sympathoadrenal
   activation would begin, resulting in an unawareness of hypoglycemia.
   Methods. We measured glucose uptake in the brain at plasma glucose
   concentrations of 105 and 54 mg per deciliter (5.8 and 3.0 mmol per
   liter) in 24 patients with IDDM, stratified into three groups according
   to their glycosylated hemoglobin values (mean {[}+/-SD] values, 7.2 +/-
   0.5, 8.5 +/- 0.4, and 10.2 +/- 1.3 percent) and compared the values for
   brain glucose uptake with those measured in 15 normal subjects at plasma
   glucose concentrations of 85 and 55 mg per deciliter (4.2 and 3.1 mmol
   per liter). We also recorded the subjects' hypoglycemic-symptom scores
   and measured their plasma concentrations of counterregulatory hormones.
   Results. There was no significant change in the uptake of glucose in the
   brain (calculated as the uptake during hypoglycemia minus the uptake
   during normoglycemia) among the patients with IDDM who had the lowest
   glycosylated hemoglobin values (+0.6 +/- 2.0, mg {[}3.3 +/- 11.1 mu mol]
   per 100 g of brain tissue per minute, P = 0.39). Conversely, glucose
   uptake in the brain fell in both the group with intermediate values (a
   decrease of 1.3 +/- 1.0 mg {[}7.2 +/- 5.6 mu mol] per 100 g per minute,
   P = 0.009) and the group with the highest values (a decrease of 1.8 +/-
   1.6 mg {[}10.0 +/- 9.0, mu mol] per 100 g per minute, P = 0.01), as it
   did in the normal subjects (a decrease of 1.6 +/- 1.8 mg {[}9.0 +/- 10.1
   mu mol] per 100 g per minute, P = 0.003). The responses of plasma
   epinephrine and pancreatic polypeptide and the frequency of symptoms of
   hypoglycemia were lowest in the group with the lowest glycosylated
   hemoglobin values.
   Conclusions. During hypoglycemia, patients with IDDM who have nearly
   normal glycosylated hemoglobin values have normal glucose uptake in the
   brain, which preserves cerebral metabolism, reduces the responses of
   counter-regulatory hormones, and causes an unawareness of hypoglycemia.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis may be at increased
   risk for preterm delivery, We investigated whether treatment with
   metronidazole and erythromycin during the second trimester would low er
   the incidence of delivery before 37 weeks' gestation.
   Methods. In 624 pregnant women at risk for delivering prematurely,
   vaginal and cervical cultures and other laboratory tests for bacterial
   vaginosis were performed at a mean of 22.9 weeks' gestation. We then
   performed a 2:1 double-blind randomization to treatment with
   metronidazole and erythromycin (433 women) or placebo (191 women). After
   treatment, the vaginal and cervical tests were repeated and a second
   course of treatment was given to women who had bacterial vaginosis at
   that time (a mean of 27.6 weeks' gestation).
   Results. A total of 178 women (29 percent) delivered infants at less
   than 37 weeks' gestation. Eight women were lost to follow-up, In the
   remaining population, 110 of the 426 women assigned to metronidazole and
   erythromycin (26 percent) delivered prematurely, as compared with 68 of
   the 190 assigned to placebo (36 percent, P = 0.01). However, the
   association between the study treatment and lower rates of prematurity
   was observed only among the 258 women who had bacterial vaginosis (rate
   of preterm delivery, 31 percent with treatment vs. 49 percent with
   placebo; P = 0.006). Of the 358 women who did not have bacterial
   vaginosis when initially examined, 22 percent of those assigned to
   metronidazole and erythromycin and 25 percent of those assigned to
   placebo delivered prematurely (P = 0.55). The lower rate of preterm
   delivery among the women with bacterial vaginosis who were assigned to
   the study treatment was observed both in women at risk because of
   previous preterm delivery (preterm delivery in the treatment group, 39
   percent; and in the placebo group, 57 percent; P = 0.02) and in women
   who weighed less than 50 kg before pregnancy (preterm delivery in the
   treatment group, 14 percent; and in the placebo group, 33 percent; P =
   0.04).
   Conclusions. Treatment with metronidazole and erythromycin reduced rates
   of premature delivery in women with bacterial vaginosis and an increased
   risk for preterm delivery.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic rejection is the primary cause of long-term allograft loss,
   Macrophages and their products have been shown to be critical in the
   development of this process in an established kidney allograft rat
   model, A new synthetic agent, Gamma lactone, is a specific inhibitor of
   macrophages and monocytes that inhibits the generation of these
   populations in vitro and their activities in the effector phase of host
   alloresponsiveness. We tested its effects on the development of chronic
   changes in the model, Untreated control allograft recipients developed
   increasing proteinuria after 12 weeks; progressive glomerulosclerosis,
   interstitial fibrosis, and arterial obliteration developed thereafter,
   Infiltrating ED1+ macrophages as noted by immunohistology increased
   dramatically between 12 and 16 weeks, localizing preferentially in
   glomeruli and perivascular areas, The presence of these cells was
   associated with dense expression of their products, Reverse
   transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed and expanded the
   immunohistological findings, showing significant gene expression of
   macrophage-derived mediators, In contrast, recipients treated with G-Lac
   daily for 32 weeks never developed proteinuria; macrophage infiltration
   was dramatically reduced, and expression of their products was virtually
   absent. At 32 weeks, most glomeruli and arteries remained histologically
   normal. In another group in which treatment was stopped at 24 weeks,
   however, proteinuria began to develop by 32 weeks; macrophages
   infiltrated the organs and expression of their products became manifest.
   These results confirm the importance of macrophages and
   macrophage-derived factors in chronic rejection and suggest that a
   specific inhibitor of macrophage activation may be useful in the
   prevention of the process over the long term.}},

Abstract = {{Somatization, the reporting of somatic symptoms that have no
   pathophysiological explanation, appears to be increasing as
   sociocultural currents reduce the public's tolerance of mild symptoms
   and benign infirmities and lower the threshold for seeking medical
   attention for such complaints. These trends coincide with a progressive
   medicalization of physical distress in which uncomfortable bodily states
   and isolated symptoms are reclassified as diseases fdr which medical
   treatment is sought. Somatization and medicalization are likely to
   become more problematic in the era of managed care. Under capitation,
   providers will have greater incentives to reduce utilization, and
   somatizing patients may feel forced to express their `'dis-ease'' in
   more urgent and exaggerated terms in order to gain access to the
   physician. in addition, prepaid subscribers will suffer little financial
   disincentive to seek medical attention for relatively minor complaints;
   therefore, they are likely to increase the demand for physician
   consultation. This situation suggests an urgent need to improve the
   management of somatizing patients. Innovative consultative, behavioral,
   and educational interventions are now available. In addition, medical
   professionals should greet the process of medicalization with
   considerable caution and educate the public more about the normative
   presence of symptoms and bodily distress in healthy people. Additional
   research is needed into somatization and its relationship to the demand
   for medical care. In an era of managed care, increased attention should
   be devoted to understanding and controlling the demand for care, a large
   portion of which is symptom driven.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the present study was to investigate the role played by
   GABA(B) receptors in the regulation of gastric basal pepsinogen
   secretion in anaesthetized rats. Following parenteral administration,
   the GABA(B) receptor agonists(-)-baclofen and 3-aminopropylphosphinic
   acid (3-APPA) caused a dose-dependent increase in basal pepsinogen
   secretion which was associated with a parallel increment in acid output.
   The gastric stimulant effects induced by both agonists were not affected
   by intracerebroventricular injection of the GABA(B) receptor antagonists
   2-hydroxy-saclofen, 3-aminopropyl(diethoxymethyl)phosphinic acid (CGP
   35348) or phaclofen, whereas the excitatory actions were antagonized by
   intravenously administered 2-hydroxy-saclofen or CGP 35348, but not
   phaclofen. In addition, the (-)-baclofen-induced increases in both
   pepsinogen and acid output, were fully prevented by omeprazole or
   cimetidine, partly reduced by atropine and unaffected by pretreatment
   with capsaicin. When tested on rats undergoing bilateral cervical
   vagotomy, both (-)-baclofen and 3-APPA were still able to stimulate the
   basal pepsinogen and acid secretions, although at a lesser extent than
   in animals with intact vagus nerves. The stimulant actions elicited
   by(-)-baclofen in vagotomized rats were antagonized by
   2-hydroxy-saclofen or CGP 35348, but not phaclofen. Moreover, these
   gastric excitatory effects were prevented by cimetidine or compound
   48/50, while being unaffected by atropine. The present results show that
   peripheral GABA(B) receptors mediate an excitatory effect on gastric
   pepsinogen secretion which totally depends on an increase in acid
   output. It is also suggested that both vagal cholinergic and extravagal
   pathways, probably histaminergic in nature, take part in these GABA(B)
   receptor-mediated gastric stimulant actions.}},

Abstract = {{The kinetics of dissociation of (H2OCl- and (H2OCl- at essentially zero
   pressure by absorption of infrared photons from the background radiation
   field (ZTRID) are compared with theoretical expectations and kinetic
   modeling. New experimental dissociation results as a function of
   temperature are reported for (H2OCl-. Density functional calculations of
   the complex structures and the normal mode frequencies and integrated
   infrared absorption intensities are described. A master equation
   approach was used to model the dissociation rates predicted from these
   molecular properties. Using literature dissociation enthalpies in the
   modeling, order-of-magnitude agreement between experimental and
   predicted dissociation rates with no adjustable parameters was found.
   Alternatively, taking the ZTRID measurements as independent
   determinations of the dissociation enthalpies, values of Delta
   H-diss(298) of 11.6 kcal ((H2OCl-) and 9.5 kcal ((H2OCl-) were derived,
   in modest disagreement with literature. Redetermination of the (H2OCl-
   dissociation enthalpy by high-pressure mass spectrometry gave 11.9 kcal
   mol(-1), in excellent accord with the ZTRID value. The ZTRlD Delta
   H-diss(298) value for (H2OCl- was confirmed by analysis of the
   temperature dependence, and we consider it to be reliable. The success
   of this modeling is taken as a strong validation of our picture of the
   ZTRID process, and this is suggested as a promising new approach to
   estimation of ion dissociation thermochemistry.}},

Abstract = {{A key manifestation of chronic rejection is an obliterative
   arteriosclerosis, Myointimal thickening in the vessel is preceded by an
   endothelialitis involving accumulation of host mononuclear cells in the
   perivascular and intimal spaces, We report a paratopic LEW-to-F344 rat
   carotid artery transplantation model developed to study the cells,
   cytokines, and inflammatory response associated with this early phase of
   vascular immune injury, Compared with contralateral control arteries and
   isografts, LEW-to-F344 carotid allografts develop intimal thickening
   with mononuclear cell infiltration that persists (days 20, 45, 75, 90,
   and 120). Allografted vessels had dense collections of intimal and
   adventitial leukocytes (CD45+) consisting of equal numbers of T cells
   and macrophages, There were small but variable numbers of intimal smooth
   muscle cells, Intimal cells showed dense staining for tumor necrosis
   factor-alpha, interleukin-8, platelet-derived growth factor, iNOS, and
   ICAM and weaker labeling for interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-6, There
   was also prominent staining for interleukin-4 and interleukin-7 with no
   detectable interferon-gamma or interleukin-alpha staining and high titer
   labeling for IgG1 (but not IgG2). The predominance of the T cell
   infiltrate coupled with interleukin-4 and IgG1 expression in carotid
   allografts is consistent with a TH2 response. This contrasts with
   balloon-injured rat carotids, which evoke a macrophage-dependent
   proliferative response, These findings demonstrate that there are
   distinct as well as common activation pathways in various forms of
   vascular injury and the LEW-to-F344 carotid model provides the
   opportunity to gain insight into molecular mechanisms regulating
   alloimmune injury in the vessel.}},

Abstract = {{The HMG-box sequence motif (similar to 80 residues) occurs in a number
   of abundant eukaryotic chromosomal proteins such as HMG1, which binds
   DNA without sequence specificity, but with `'structure specificity'', as
   well as in several sequence-specific transcription factors. HMG1 has two
   such boxes, A and B, which show similar to 30\% sequence identity, and
   an acidic C-terminal tail. The boxes are responsible for the ability of
   the protein to bend DNA and bind to bent or distorted DNA. The structure
   of the HMG box has been determined by NMR spectroscopy for the B-domain
   of HMG1 {[}Weir et al. (1993) EMBO J. 12, 1311-1319; Read et al. (1993)
   Nucleic Acids lies. 21, 3427-3436) and for Drosophila HMG-D (Jones et
   al. (1994) Structure 2, 609-627]. It has an unusual twisted L-shape,
   suggesting that the protein might tumble anisotropically in solution. In
   this paper we report studies of the A-domain from HMG1 using N-15 NMR
   spectroscopy which show that the backbone dynamics of the protein can be
   described by two different rotational correlation times of 9.0 +/- 0.5
   and 10.8 +/- 0.5 ns. We show that the relaxation data can be analyzed by
   assuming that the protein is a rigid, axially symmetric ellipsoid
   undergoing anisotropic rotational diffusion; the global rotational
   diffusion constants, D-parallel to and D-perpendicular to, were
   estimated as 2.47 x 10(7) and 1.49 x 10(7) s(-1), respectively. By
   estimating the angle between the amide bond vectors and the major axis
   of the rotational diffusion tensor from the family of structures
   determined by NMR spectroscopy {[}see accompanying paper, Hardman et al.
   (1995) Biochemistry 34, 16596-16607], we were able to show that the
   ellipsoid spectral density equation can reproduce the major features of
   the N-15 T-1 and T-2 profiles of the three helices in the HMG1 A-domain.
   The backbone dynamics of the A-domain were then compared with those of
   the B-domain and the HMG box from HMG-D. This comparison strongly
   supported the differences observed in the orientation of helix I in the
   three structures, where the B-domain appears to be more similar to HMG-D
   than it is to the A-domain. These differences may turn out to be related
   to subtle differences in the DNA-binding properties of the A- and
   B-domains of HMG1.}},

Abstract = {{In this report, we investigated the possibility that a product of
   phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) breakdown, inositol
   1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P-3), and its downstream effector, Ca2+,
   is involved in oocyte maturation. Microinjection of monoclonal antibody
   specifically directed to PIP2 into oocytes prior to progesterone
   addition inhibited meiotic maturation. In addition, preventing or
   suppressing the progesterone-induced increase in {[}Ca2+](i) and
   maintaining cytosolic free Ca2+ of oocyte at 0.1 or 0.3 mu M by
   Br-2-BAPTA buffered Ca2+ solutions, completely blocked maturation.
   However, raising cytosolic Ca2+ concentration of oocyte to 1.0 or 3.0 mu
   M, the inhibitory Br-2-BAPTA effects on oocyte maturation was greatly
   diminished. Finally, microinjection of heparin, a potent antagonist of
   Ins(1,4,5)P-3 receptor, inhibited progesterone-induced oocyte maturation
   in a manner that is linearly proportional to its cytoplasmic
   concentration. These results strongly support the hypothesis that PIP2
   turnover as well as Ins(1,4,5)P-3-induced Ca2+ release play crucial
   roles in regulating normal meiotic cell division in Xenopus oocyte. (C)

   revealed the molar ratio between integrase and zinc to be close to 1. It
   is concluded that both the N-terminal and the C-terminal regions of

Abstract = {{The cause of asthma is still unknown. Though most asthmatic patients are
   atopic, only certain atopic subjects develop this disease, and atopic
   asthmatics recover from asthma after transplantation of lungs from
   nonasthmatic donors. Thus, there might be a primary local defect in the
   bronchial wall which affects the expression of asthma in atopic
   individuals. We show here that the bronchial epithelial cells from
   atopic patients with asthma are aberrantly permeable to the airborne
   allergen most often implicated in the pathogenesis of this disease,
   indicating how it can have access to the antigen-presenting cells
   (dendritic cells) below the apical surface of the epithelium in viva. In
   addition, allergen exposure induces asthmatic epithelial cells to
   express granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, a cytokine
   involved in the proliferation and function of dendritic cells. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{Many lipases are potent catalysts of stereoselective reactions and are
   therefore of interest for use in chemical synthesis. The crystal
   structures of lipases show a large variation in the shapes of their

   substrate specificity of these enzymes. We have determined the
   three-dimensional structure of Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB)
   cocrystallized with the detergent Tween 80. In another crystal form, the
   structure of the enzyme in complex with a covalently bound phosphonate
   inhibitor has been determined. In both structures, the active site is
   exposed to the external solvent. The potential lid-forming helix alpha 5
   in CALB is well-ordered in the Tween 80 structure and disordered in the
   inhibitor complex. The tetrahedral intermediates of two chiral
   substrates have been modeled on the basis of available structural and
   biochemical information. The results of this study provide a structural
   explanation for the high stereoselectivity of CALB toward many secondary

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider mixed systems containing both stochastic and
   nonstochastic(1) components. To compose such systems, we introduce a
   general combinator which allows the specification of an arbitrary mixed
   system in terms of elementary components of only two types. Thus,
   systems are obtained hierarchically, by composing subsystems, where each
   subsystem can be viewed as an `'increment'' in the decomposition of the
   full system. The resulting mixed stochastic system specifications are
   generally not `'executable'', since they do not necessarily permit the
   incremental simulation of the system variables, Such a simulation
   requires compiling the dependency relations existing between the system
   variables. Another issue involves finding the most likely internal
   states of a stochastic system from a set of observations. We provide a
   small set of primitives for transforming mixed systems, which allows the
   solution of the two problems of incremental simulation and estimation of
   stochastic systems within a common framework. The complete model is
   called CSS (a Calculus of Stochastic Systems), and is implemented by the
   SIG language, derived from the SIGNAL synchronous language. Our results
   are applicable to pattern recognition problems formulated in terms of
   Markov random fields or hidden Markov models (HMMs), and to the
   automatic generation of diagnostic systems for industrial plants
   starting from their risk analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Updated radiometric calibration and systematic processing procedures for
   Galileo solid-state imaging (SSI) data from the first(1990) Earth-Moon
   encounter are presented. These procedures were applied to a whole-disk
   imaging sequence of the Moon centered near Mare Orientale, called Lunmap
   14 (L14). Processing of L14 data included radiometric calibration,
   subpixel coregistration, scattered light removal, geometric control and
   reprojection, photometric normalization, and calibration to Earth-based
   spectra. Coregistration and scattered-light removal procedures are
   improvements over the initial calibration of the SSI mosaics. The
   effects of scattered light correction are best seen using a whole-Moon
   view such as L14; resolution of the debated amounts of light scattering
   from within or outside the camera field of view is not necessary.
   Scattered light removal particularly affects the 1-mu m spectral region
   and has implications for interpretation of mafic mineral signatures in
   mare deposits of the lunar limb and farside. Recalibrated spectra
   indicate that mare ponds of the limb show moderately deep 1-mu m
   absorptions, and thus mafic mineral contents, comparable to those of
   other nearside basalts. Mafic mineral contents of Schiller-Shickard
   cryptomaria are higher than previously thought and are similar to some
   low-Ti nearside basalts. Many of the recalibrated spectra from South
   Pole/Aitken are similar to those of Schiller-Schickard cryptomaria,
   suggesting that many of these soils represent a mixed mare/highland
   lithology, The hypothesis that there is an olivine enrichment in
   southern South Pole/Aitken basin is not supported strongly by spectra
   shown here.}},

Title = {{Inviscid separated flow over a non-slender delta wing}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{305}},
Pages = {{307-345}},
Month = {{DEC 25}},
Abstract = {{We consider inviscid incompressible flow about an infinite non-slender
   flat delta wing with leading-edge separation modelled by symmetrical
   conical vortex sheets. A similarity solution for the three-dimensional
   steady velocity potential Phi is sought with boundary conditions to be
   satisfied on the line which is the intersection of the wing-sheet
   surface with the surface of the unit sphere. A numerical approach is
   developed based on the construction of a special boundary element or
   `winglet' which is effectively a Green function for the projection of
   del(2) Phi = 0 onto the spherical surface under the similarity ansatz.
   When the wing semi-apex angle gamma(0) is fixed, satisfaction of the
   boundary conditions of zero normal velocity on the wing and zero normal
   velocity and pressure continuity across the vortex sheet then leads to a
   nonlinear eigenvalue problem. A method of ensuring a condition of zero
   lateral force on a lumped model of the inner part of the rolled-up
   vortex sheet gives a closed set of equations which is solved numerically
   by Newton's method. We present and discuss the properties of solutions
   for gamma(0) in the range 1.3 degrees less than or equal to gamma(0)
   less than or equal to 89.5 degrees. The dependencies of these solutions
   on gamma(0) differs qualitatively from predictions of slender-body
   theory. In particular the velocity held is in general not conical and
   the similarity exponent must be calculated as part of the global
   eigenvalue problem. This exponent, together with the detailed flow field
   including the position and structure of the separated vortex sheet,
   depend only on gamma(0). In the limit of small gamma(0), a comparison
   with slender-body theory is made on the basis of an effective angle of
   incidence.}},

Abstract = {{The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) protein EBNA2 is a transcriptional
   activator that can be targeted to its DNA responsive elements by direct
   interaction with the cellular protein RBP-J kappa. RBP-J kappa is a
   ubiquitous factor, highly conserved between man, mouse and Drosophila,
   whose function in mammalian cells is largely unknown, Here we provide
   evidence that RBP-J kappa is a transcriptional repressor and, more
   importantly, that RBP-J kappa repression is mediated by a co-repressor,
   The function of the cc-repressor could be counterbalanced by making a
   fusion protein (RBP-VP16) between RBP-J kappa and the VP16 activation
   domain, This RBP-VP16-mediated activation could be strongly increased by
   an EBNA2 protein deprived of its activation domain, but not by an EBNA2
   protein incapable of making physical contact with RBP-J kappa. Our
   results suggest that EBNA2 activates transcription by both interfering
   with the function of a co-repressor recruited by RBP-J kappa and
   providing an activation domain.}},

Abstract = {{Otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) evoked by click stimuli were recorded in
   both ears of 20 normal human subjects, in the presence and absence of a
   contralateral masking broad band noise. No difference in the amplitude
   of OAE suppression was noted between the first rested ear and the second
   one. In addition, 20 pathological subjects were tested according to the
   same protocol. Ten of them belonged to a group of patients whose
   vestibular nerve was sectioned on one side to relieve incapacitating
   vertigo and thus represented a group in whom olivocochlear efferents
   were severed. A great reduction of suppression observed in the operated
   ear suggested that olivocochlear efferent fibers are necessary to obtain
   a full suppressive effect. Three of the pathological subjects were
   patients who had undergone a decompression of the facial nerve which
   necessitated the same surgical approach as vestibular neurotomy, but
   without any section of vestibular fibers. This surgical control group
   demonstrated that the surgical act by itself cannot explain the
   difference observed in the neurotomized group. Finally, seven of the
   pathological subjects were patients with Bell's palsy, which paralyses
   the facial nerve and abolishes the stapedial reflex. No suppression
   difference was observed between healthy ears and ears without stapedial
   reflex. Therefore, it appeared that the stapedial reflex was not
   involved in the contralateral suppression of EOAEs. However, as the
   tensor tympani muscle remained functional in these patients, its
   involvement in the suppressive effect cannot be excluded.}},

Abstract = {{When the European eel matures sexually and migrates back to deep sea
   breeding grounds the visual pigments in its rod photoreceptors change
   from being maximally sensitive to green light to being maximally
   sensitive to blue light. In part, this change in sensitivity is due to a
   change in the opsin component of the visual pigment molecule. We used
   hormone injection to induce these developmental changes in a group of
   eels and from these animals an opsin coding region was cloned and
   sequenced using cDNA made from retinal mRNA. From the retinae of
   hormone-injected eels and those not injected with hormones, distinct
   opsin mRNAs were isolated. These mRNAs encode two rod opsin proteins
   that are very similar but have significant amino acid substitutions in
   key positions that are likely to be involved in spectral tuning of the
   eel green and blue sensitive rod visual pigment molecules.}},

   Livers were removed, and hepatic levels of a variety of
   drug-metabolizing enzymes were determined with either catalytic assays
   or by quantifying levels of total cellular RNA coding for the individual
   genes of interest The high dose of DAS induced the cytochrome P450 (CYP)
   2B subfamily to near maximal levels {[}i.e. similar to those induced by
   phenobarbital (PB)] and induced the CYP3A subfamily, while having
   minimal effects on the levels of the CYP1A subfamily. In addition, DAS
   induced the glutathione 5-transferase alpha subfamily, the glutathione
   S-transferase mu subfamily, and epoxide hydrolase. Unlike PB, however,
   DAS was also able to induce quinone oxidoreductase. In fact, the
   pleiotropic hepatic response to DAS appeared to be similar to that
   elicited by PB, with the exception that only DAS induced quinone
   oxidoreductase. Finally, we determined that DAS induced the levels of a

Abstract = {{The NAD(P)H:flavin oxidoreductase from Escherichia coli, Fre, is a
   monomer of 26.2 kDa that catalyzes the reduction of free flavins by
   NADPH or NADH. Overexpression in E. coli now allows the preparation of
   large amounts of pure protein, Structural requirements for recognition
   of flavins as substrates and not as cofactors were studied by
   steady-state kinetics with a variety of flavin analogs. The entire
   isoalloxazine ring was found to be the essential part of the flavin
   molecule for inter action with the polypeptide chain. Methyl groups at
   C-7 and C-8 of the isoalloxazine ring and the N-3 of riboflavin also
   play an important role in that interaction, whereas the ribityl chain of
   the riboflavin is not required for binding to the protein. On the other
   hand, the presence of the 2'-OH of the ribityl chain stimulates the
   NADPH-dependent reaction significantly, Moreover, a study of competitive
   inhibitors for both substrates demonstrated that Fre follows a
   sequential ordered mechanism in which NADPH binds first followed by
   riboflavin, Lumichrome, a very good inhibitor of Fre, may be used to
   inhibit flavin reductase in E. coli growing cells. As a consequence, it
   can enhance the antiproliferative effect of hydroxyurea, a cell-specific
   ribonucleotide reductase inactivator.}},

Abstract = {{The chicken H2B gene family comprises eight members (H2B-I to H2B-VIII),
   which are all located in two major histone gene clusters. All of them
   have been shown to encode four different protein variants (classes I to
   IV). In the DT40 chicken B cell line, the H2B-V gene, encoding the class
   III H2B variant, constituted about 10\% of the total intracellular mRNA
   from all the H2B genes. To study the nature of this particular variant
   in vivo, me generated heterozygous (H2B-V, +/-) and homozygous (H2B-V,
   -/-) DT40 mutants by targeted integration. The remaining H2B genes were
   shown to be expressed more in these mutants than in the wild-type cell
   lines. The growth rate of DT40 cells was unchanged in the absence of the
   H2B-V gene. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed
   that the protein patterns were, on the whole, similar between the
   wildtype and homozygous cell lines. However, within this constant
   background, some cellular proteins disappeared or decreased
   quantitatively in the homozygous mutants, and several other proteins
   increased or newly appeared. These results suggest that the class III
   H2B variant participates negatively or positively in regulation of the
   expression of particular genes that encode the proteins that vary in
   DT40 cells. This type of regulation is possibly mediated through
   alterations in nucleosome structure over the restricted regions
   involving the putative genes of the DT40 genome.}},

Abstract = {{We have studied three Phase II genes in the mouse dioxin-inducible
   {[}Ah] battery: Nmol {[}encoding NAD(P)H:menadione oxidoreductase], Ahd4
   (encoding the cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH3c), and Ugt1{*}06 (a
   UDP glucuronosyltransferase). Oxidant-induced Nmol gene expression in
   the c(14CoS)/c(14CoS) mouse appears likely to be caused by homozygous
   loss of the fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (Fah) gene on Chr 7 and
   absence of the enzyme (FAH), which leads to increased levels of
   endogenous tyrosine oxidative metabolites. We show here that increases
   in {[}Ah] Phase II gene expression in the 14CoS/14CoS mouse are
   correlated with an AP-1-like DNA motif called the electrophile response
   element (EpRE), which has been found in the 5' flanking regulatory
   regions of all murine {[}Ah] Phase II genes. Aromatic hydrocarbon
   response element (AhREs) are responsible for dioxin-mediated
   upregulation of all six {[}Ah] battery genes, and one or more AhREs have
   been found in the 5' flanking regulatory regions of all of these {[}Ah]
   genes. Gel mobility shift assays, with a synthetic oligonucleotide probe
   corresponding to the EpRE, show that EpRE-binding proteins are more than
   twice as abundant in 14CoS/14CoS than in the wild-type ch/ch nuclear
   extracts. Competition studies of EpRE-specific binding with an excess of
   EpRE, mutated EpRE, AP-I, AhRE3, mutated AhRE3, and C/EBP alpha
   oligonucleotides suggest that several common transcriptional factors
   bind to the EpRE and AhRE3 motifs. Two monospecific antibodies to the Ah
   receptor (AHR) protein block formation of an EpRE-specific complex on
   gel mobility electrophoresis. These data suggest that AHR (or
   AHR-related protein) might be an integral part of the EpRE-binding
   transcriptional complex associated with the oxidative stress response.
   To our knowledge, this is among the first reports of the same
   transcription factor operating at two different response elements
   upstream of a single gene.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is a first step towards a different way of looking at the
   practice of OR, with implications for practitioners and researchers
   alike. We make two key observations: 1) Looking al how OR practitioners
   perform individual projects will not lead to a full understanding of how
   OR practitioners perform individual projects. Instead, one has to take
   into account the series of preceding projects by that same practitioner,
   to infer and understand his `strand of practice'. 2) A practitioner's
   strand of practice is developed as the result of a learning process.
   Therefore, practitioners operating in different environments can have
   widely different strands of practice. Consequently, operationalizable
   guidelines about how to perform OR projects will have to include an
   indication of the strand(s) of practice for which they are valid. Our
   observations are based on an exploratory series of interviews with
   practitioners and their clients.}},

Abstract = {{Platinum was deposited onto pure alumina as well as on alumina modified
   by addition of 7 and 15 wt.-\% barium. The alumina hydroxyl groups were
   neutralized by barium addition and the surface of the modified support
   had a basic character. The introduction of barium decreased the
   accessible platinum area because of a sintering of the metal particles
   associated with a partial coverage of the platinum crystallites by
   barium containing species. In addition, the platinum surface atoms were
   electron-enriched. As a consequence the catalytic activity of alumina
   supported platinum was lowered in the presence of barium. Nevertheless,
   the turn-over numbers were not strongly modified by the barium additive,
   suggesting that the catalytic properties of accessible platinum atoms
   were not sensitive to the electronic effect induced by barium addition.}},

Abstract = {{Juvenile Burmese pythons (Python molurus) undergo dramatic increases in
   intestinal nutrient transport, hypertrophy of intestinal mucosa, and
   very large increases in metabolic rate in response to feeding. This
   study investigates whether hatchling P. molurus, after their very first
   meal, experience magnitudes of digestive responses greater than or equal
   to those occurring for juveniles that have consumed many previous meals.
   After consuming their first meal, hatchling P. molurus increased oxygen
   consumption rates 12-fold, up-regulated intestinal nutrient transport
   three- to fourfold, and experienced a twofold increase in small
   intestinal wet mass. One day after feeding, their stomachs and livers
   significantly increased in mass, whereas the mass of their gallbladders
   significantly decreased. These postfeeding responses of hatchlings are
   similar in magnitude and mass-specific values to those of juvenile P.
   molurus. Thus, young P. molurus up-regulate intestinal nutrient
   transport and undergo intestinal hypertrophy to the same magnitudes
   after their first meal as they do following future meals. The
   significance of this phenomenon is that, at the completion of digestion,
   the small intestine of juvenile pythons atrophies and down-regulates its
   functions to values comparable to those of the naive gut of hatchlings.
   This study demonstrates that, regardless of previous digestive history,
   the intestine of young P. molurus exhibits conserved magnitudes of
   postfeeding responses and that, during digestive quiescence, the
   energetic cost of maintaining the intestine is minimized.}},

Abstract = {{Whereas the molecular natures of M-CSF/CSF-1 and its receptor c-fms are
   well characterized, its actual role in the intramarrow hematopoiesis
   remains obscure, This is because disruption of this signaling pathway
   results in the osteopetrosis mouse that lacks the bone cavity for
   hematopoiesis. To elucidate the role of c-fms in intramarrow
   hematopoiesis, we produced an antagonistic monoclonal antibody to murine
   c-fms and investigated its expression and function in the normal bone
   marrow, c-fms(+) cells were detected both in mature and immature
   hematopoietic cells, Morphologically, c-kit(+)c-fms(-), c-kit(+)c-fms(+)
   and c-kit(-)c-fms(+) cells were medium sized blasts, large promyelocytes
   with azurophilic granules and mature monocytes respectively, CFU-M was
   10-fold more enriched in the c-kit(+)c-fms(-) than c-kit(+)c-fms(+)
   fraction, Moreover, injection of the anti c-fms antibody had no effect
   on the production of CFU-M in the bone marrow, while anti-c-kit mAb
   could deplete them, hs ckit(+)c-fms(+) cells were readily generated in
   the culture of c-kit(+)c-fms(-) cells, most of the CFU-M in the bone
   marrow are, in fact, c-fms(-) cells that differentiate into c-fms(+)
   upon culture, These observations indicate a clear functional hierarchy
   of c-kit and c-fms in the bone marrow, Namely, c-kit plays the primary
   role in the production and maintenance of CFU-M, while c-fms, though it
   co-expressed with c-kit and functions as the growth receptor for M-CSF
   in the culture, has only a minimum role in the proliferation of c-fms(+)
   cells in the bone marrow.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a method for evaluating analytical long-range contributions
   to scattering lengths for some potentials used in atomic physics. We
   assume that an interaction potential between colliding particles
   consists of two parts. The form of a short-range component, vanishing
   beyond some distance from the origin (a core radius), need not be given.
   Instead, we assume that a set of short-range scattering lengths due to
   that part of the interaction is known. A long-range tail of the
   potential is chosen to be an inverse power potential, a superposition of
   two inverse power potentials with suitably chosen exponents or the Lent
   potential. For these three classes of long-range interactions a radial
   Schrodinger equation at zero energy may be solved analytically with
   solutions expressed in terms of the Bessel, Whittaker and Legendre
   functions, respectively. We utilize this fact and derive exact
   analytical formulae for the scattering lengths. The expressions depend
   on the short-range scattering lengths, the core radius and parameters
   characterizing the long-range part of the interaction. Cases when the
   long-range potential (or its part) may be treated as a perturbation are
   also discussed and formulae for scattering lengths linear in strengths
   of the perturbing potentials are given. It is shown that for some
   combination of the orbital angular momentum quantum number and an
   exponent of the leading term of the potential the derived formulae,
   exact or approximate, take very simple forms and contain only polynomial
   and trigonometric functions. The expressions obtained in this paper are
   applicable to scattering of charged particles by neutral targets and to
   collisions between neutrals. The results are illustrated by accelerating
   convergence of scattering lengths computed for e(-)-Xe and Cs-Cs
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Evaluating the `safety' of drugs produced by biotechnology resembles the
   assessment of conventional `new chemical entities,' but with certain
   major differences. The `quality' of the product requires careful control
   because of concern about the carry-over of DNA, immunogenic proteins,
   endotoxin and process chemicals. Equally the potency and purity of the
   product must also be considered, as well as its identity.
   The toxicity testing of rDNA-derived proteins, monoclonal antibodies and
   vaccines, although increasingly being swept under the umbrella of
   conventional studies, should be empirically devised according to the
   nature and physiological effects of the substance, taking account of the
   responsiveness of suitable species for non-clinical testing, the
   potential immunogenicity of heterologous proteins and any effect the
   drug may have on physiological mechanisms and the immune status of the
   test animals. Conventional types of single and multidose and
   reproduction toxicity experiments can then be adapted to detect and
   investigate any hazard of the novel drug. Kinetics, metabolism and drug
   interactions should be explored and the regulatory demand for
   genotoxicity data satisfied. If appropriate, immunological actions,
   including auto-immunity, can be sought. `Safety-in-use' should then be
   predictable with some confidence, because of the extent of the
   toxicological investigations and because activities that cannot be
   examined will have been delineated, e.g. lack of a responsive species or
   of a suitable laboratory procedure.}},

Abstract = {{We have obtained 13 moderate-resolution (similar to 2.5 Angstrom)
   spectra of the Galactic X-ray nova GS 2000+25 in quiescence with the W.
   M. Keck 10 m telescope. Cross-correlation with the spectra of late-type
   dwarfs (especially K2-K7) yields excellent radial velocities for the
   secondary star. The orbital period is consistent with that previously
   obtained from photometry (similar to 8.3 hr). A semiamplitude of 518.4
   +/- 3.5 km s(-1) is found, similar to 25\% smaller than the outer disk
   velocity implied by the double-peaked H alpha emission line (Delta v/2
   approximate to 700 km s(-1)). The derived mass function is 4.97 +/- 0.10
   Mo, the second highest known for any low-mass X-ray binary. Being
   considerably above the conventional limiting mass for a neutron star
   (similar to 3.2 M.), it strongly suggests that the compact primary is a
   black hole. Plausible mass estimates based on M(2) = 0.4-0.7 M. and i =
   67 degrees 5-80 degrees are M(1) = 5.9-7.5 M.. Under the assumption that
   the radial velocity curve of the centroid of the Ha emission line

Abstract = {{A major solar flare (X-ray importance M1.5 and optical importance SB)
   was fully observed by the Very Large Array and the Yohkoh mission on
   1993 April 22. Both thermal and nonthermal emissions were observed in
   radio. In soft X-rays, the flare was confined to a compact region in an
   arcade. In hard X-rays, there were two prominent footpoints, coincident
   in projection with the soft X-ray footpoints and located on either side
   of the magnetic neutral line inferred from photospheric magnetograms.
   The Yohkoh Bent Crystal Spectrometer (BCS) data provided important
   context information which was helpful in cross-checking the quantitative
   agreement between the radio and X-ray data. The microwave spectrum
   peaked around 10 GHz and showed Razin suppression in the beginning.
   Later on, the low-frequency spectral index dropped to a value of 2,
   suggesting thermal emission. The VLA images of the flare at 1.5 GHz show
   that the flare emission started as a single source above one footpoint;
   later on, the emission centroid moved toward the soft X-ray structure to
   finally become cospatial with the latter. The two locations of the 20 cm
   source corresponded to nonthermal (footpoint source) and thermal (source
   cospatial with the soft X-ray structure) emissions. We performed
   temperature and emission measure analysis of the X-ray data (SXT, BCS,
   and HXT) and used them as input to determine the expected radio
   emission. While there is morphological agreement between the radio and
   soft X-ray structures in the thermal phase, the 20 cm brightness
   temperature shows quantitative agreement with temperature derived from
   the BCS data. We were able to identify three emission mechanisms
   contributing to the 20 cm radio emission at different times without any
   ad hoc assumption regarding emission mechanisms. Razin-suppressed
   nonthermal gyroresonance emission, plasma emission, and thermal
   free-free emission seem to be operating and are found to be consistent
   with the plasma parameters derived from the X-ray data. The magnetic
   field structure in the flaring region showed differences before and
   after the flare as traced by soft X-ray structures in the flaring region
   and confirmed by 20 cm radio images. The superhot component with a
   temperature of 32 MK was observed in hard X-ray images and in light
   curves during the impulsive phase of the flare with possible radio
   signatures at 20 cm wavelength. We derived the physical parameters of
   the flaring plasma, the magnetic field, and the characteristics of
   nonthermal particles in the flaring region.}},

   airglow emission lines of atomic oxygen OI 557.7 nm and OI 630.0 nm over
   a wide field of view (165 degrees). A technique for the derivation of
   Doppler temperatures and wind velocities was developed by use of a
   truncated Fourier series. Thermospheric wind velocities and temperatures
   have been obtained with unprecedented high temporal (1 min) and spatial
   (24 points for an all-sky image) resolutions. Errors in the derived wind
   velocities and temperatures are estimated to be less than 25 m/s and 100
   K, respectively, for inner-fringe positions and 35 m/s and 170 K for
   outer-fringe positions, respectively. This system was applied to

   films have been studied using a series of analytical techniques with
   different degrees of surface sensivity. The treated polymer surfaces
   were found to be acidic by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in
   conjunction with the molecular probe technique, a result in agreement
   with previous wettability studies. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) has been
   used for the first time as a molecular probe to investigate the surface
   acidity of O-2 plasma treated PP. The retention of DMSO increased with
   plasma treatment time and is thus governed by surface modification which
   permits acidic groups to be grafted onto the host polymer. Such
   retention is depicted in the binding energy of S2p from DMSO. DMSO
   contact angle measurements showed that the treated surfaces exhibit
   acid-base character from the initial stage of plasma treatment as judged
   by the acid-base contribution of the total work of adhesion
   (W-DMSO-PP(ab)) which was found to readily reach a plateau at 14 mJ
   m(-2). We have used capillary electrophoresis ion analysis (CIA) to
   identify the acidic low molecular weight fragments formed at the

   features of X-ray emissions from SN 1993J as observed with ROSAT, ASCA,
   and OSSE for the first 600 days. This model consists of a realistic
   ejecta model and a clumpy CSM. The collision of the ejecta with the CSM
   creates a forward shock in the ejecta and a reverse shock in the CSM.
   The reverse shock radiates to form a cooling dense shell, and X-rays
   from the reverse shock are mostly absorbed by this shell. Early hard
   X-rays are well modeled as thermal emissions from the CSM. Later
   softening can be accounted for with emissions from shocked clumps. To
   avoid the emergence of excess hard X-rays from the ejecta, the explosion
   energy should be lower than a certain upper limit. The CSM must also
   have a spatially variable density gradient and be more clumpy in the
   outer layers. With the clumpy CSM, the ejecta undergoes weak
   deceleration, which is consistent with optical and radio observations.
   The possible origin of such a CSM is suggested in terms of binary
   evolution of the progenitor. Prediction of a possible future X-ray
   enhancement is made.}},

Abstract = {{Bluetongue virus (BTV) core-like particles (CLPs) are formed in the
   cytoplasm of insect cells when only two major proteins (VP3 and VP7) of
   the Bn, core are expressed by baculovirus vectors (T.J. French and P.
   Roy, 1990, J. Virol. 64, 1530-1536). We have recently reported that five
   small internal deletion mutants of VP3 form CLPs when provided with
   unmodified VP7 protein (D1-5; S. Tanaka and P. Roy, 1994, J. Virol. 68,
   2795-2802). To investigate whether foreign sequences can be inserted
   into VP3 and to determine their effect on CLP formation, three of these
   internal regions (D1, D2, and D5), as well as the carboxy terminus, were
   modified to create unique restriction enzyme sites, thereby replacing
   VP3 coding regions with shorter synthetic sequences. Each modified VP3
   gene was used to generate baculovirus expression vectors (D1I, D2I, D5I,
   and VP3C, respectively). Other than the D5I mutant, the mutants formed
   CLPs when expressed in the presence of VP7. Subsequently, T7 tag
   epitopes were inserted into the D1I, D2I, and VP3C restriction sites and
   recombinant baculoviruses were generated to express chimeric VP3
   proteins (VP3D1IT, VP3D2IT, and VP3CT). Each chimeric protein retained
   the ability to form CLPs when VP7 protein was provided. In another
   construction an immunogenic sequence representing a bovine leukemia
   virus (BLV) glycoprotein peptide was incorporated into the carboxy
   terminus of VP3 and the derived CLPs were used to raise antibodies that
   reacted with the BLV antigen. The results suggest that the VP3 molecule
   can accommodate foreign sequences at certain sites without perturbing
   their ability to form CLPs with VP7. (C) 1995 Academic Press, inc.}},

Abstract = {{In order to study and control fermentation processes, indirect on-line
   measurements and mathematical models can be used. In this article we
   present a mathematical on-line model for fermentation processes. The
   model is based on atom and partial mass balances as well as on equations
   describing the acid-base system. The model is brought into an adaptive
   form by including transport equations for mass transfer and unstructured
   expressions for the fermentation kinetics. The state of the process,
   i.e., the concentrations of biomass, substrate, and products, can be
   estimated on-line using the balance part of the model completed with
   measurement equations for the input and output flows of the process.
   Adaptivity is realized by means of on-line estimation of parameters in
   the transport and kinetic expressions using recursive regression
   analysis. These expressions can thus be used in the model as valid
   equations enabling prediction of the process. This makes model-based
   automation of the process and testing of the validity of the measurement
   variables possible. The model and the on-line principles are applied to
   a 3.5-L laboratory fermenter in which Saccharomyces cerevisiae is
   cultivated. The experimental results show that the model-based
   estimation of the state and the predictions of the process correlate
   closely with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses. (C)

Abstract = {{The dependence of the performance of fused-taper multimode fiber

   has been identified that for a 2 x 2 multimode fiber coupler there is a
   range of output-power-coupling ratios for which the effect of the
   external refractive index is negligible. When the coupler is tapered
   beyond this region, the performance becomes dependent on the external
   index of refraction and lossy. To analyze the multimode coupler-loss
   mechanism, we develop a two-dimensional ray-optics model that
   incorporates trapped cladding-mode loss and core-mode loss through
   frustrated total internal reflection. Computer-simulation results
   support the experimental observations. Related issues such as coupler
   fabrication and packaging are also discussed. (C) 1995 Optical Society

   from the old inflation in that the second slow rollover inflation occurs
   inside a nucleated bubble. Hence, our observable universe is entirely
   contained in one nucleated bubble. The significance of the scenario is
   that apart from a variance caused by model parameters, it gives us a
   definite prediction on the spectrum of the primordial density
   perturbations, and hence it is observationally testable. Here we
   investigate the spectrum of cosmic microwave background anisotropies on
   large angular scales. We find that the contribution from peculiar modes
   which never appear in the usual harmonic analysis is significant in the

Abstract = {{Sky-radiance measurements at the sea surface can be used to estimate
   radiative properties of aerosols over water. We demonstrate, through
   Monte Carlo simulations, that significant perturbations to sky radiance
   over the ocean can occur when measurements are carried out with
   radiometers located on islands. In particular, we present examples of
   the influence of the physical and optical thicknesses of an aerosol
   layer, the azimuth of observation relative to the Sun, the size of the
   island, the location of the radiometer on the island, and the albedo of
   the island on the magnitude of the perturbation for a circular island of
   uniform albedo. Relative errors in sky radiance of as high as 39\% were
   found in the blue. Simulated (perturbed) sky radiances were combined
   with an algorithm for retrieving the aerosol phase function P(theta),
   where theta is the scattering angle, and with the single-scattering
   albedo omega(0), to demonstrate how the perturbation can influence the
   retrieved values. It was found that the fractional error in the
   retrieved values of the product omega(0)P(theta) can be significantly
   greater than the fractional error in the sky radiance, because of the
   effects of multiple scattering. This underscores the importance of
   removing the island perturbation before an inversion algorithm is used.
   A first-order procedure for removing the island perturbation based on
   the values of omega(0)P(theta) retrieved from the perturbed sky radiance
   is proposed and is found to be effective if the island perturbation is
   not too large. A simplified Monte Carlo procedure that is applicable to
   an island of arbitrary shape and albedo distribution is presented. The
   procedure could be used to assess the suitability of a given island as a
   measurement site, and to provide a first-order correction to actual
   experimental measurements. (C) 1995 Optical Society of America}},

   The potential shift with pH is observed for short-chain substituents

   atoms). This is due to the inductive withdrawing effect of the

   cross-link was studied by molecular dynamics and quantum chemistry,
   Molecular dynamics indicated that the geometrical proximity of the
   binding sites also favored a 1,3 dG-to-dG linkage over a 1,2 dG-to-dG
   linkage in a 5'-d(GCC)-3' sequence, While the enthalpies of 1,2 and 1,3

Abstract = {{The expression of the human myeloid zinc finger gene (MZF-1) by human
   bone marrow cells is necessary for granulopoiesis. We have analyzed the
   structure and function of the human MZF-1 gene by diagnostic polymerase
   chain reaction, genomic cloning, and promoter analysis. Comparison of
   human promyelocytic HL-60 cell cDNA with isolated MZF-1 genomic clones
   indicated that the human MZF-1 gene is without introns and spans
   approximately 3 kb. Restriction enzyme mapping and Southern analysis
   indicated further that the human MZF-1 gene is a single-copy gene,
   Primer extension studies identified the major transcription start site
   as a thymidine residue located 1102 bp upstream of the ATG translation
   start codon, A putative TATA box sequence (TAAAAA) was found at -66 bp
   and a CCAAT box at -130 bp relative to the transcription initiation
   site. In HL-60 cells, MZF-1 mRNA levels are increased by granulopoietic
   inducers including retinoic acid and GM-CSF. DNA upstream of the
   transcription start site contains tandem-repeated consensus retinoic
   acid response elements at -666 through -696 bp and paired putative
   GM-CSF-responsive sequences centered at -50 and -100 bp. CAT reporter
   gene constructs containing these DNA regions promoted transcription and
   conferred transcriptional responsiveness to retinoic acid and GM-CSF
   when transfected into HL-60 cells. Additional putative regulatory
   binding sites included conserved MZF-1 zinc finger binding sequences,
   the importance of which was suggested by the enhanced expression of the
   endogenous MZF-1 gene following vector-driven expression of MZF-1
   constructs in K562 myeloblastic leukemia cells. These findings provide a
   clearer basis for understanding the role of MZF-1 gene expression in
   myeloid cell growth and differentiation.}},

   Butanol is used in place of the normal polyols used in actual coatings
   formulations in order to simplify the system for kinetic analysis. Using
   C-13-NMR, the differences in reactivity of each isocyanate group was
   studied in real-time measurements. There is little difference in the
   second-order rate constants between the three TTI isocyanate groups in
   the uncatalyzed systems at 25, 35, or 45 degrees C. The dibutyl tin
   dilaureate (DBTDL) catalyzed system exhibits similar second-order rate
   constants for the medium- and long-branch systems, and a smaller rate
   constant for the short-branch system. The activation energies increase
   with increasing chain length in the uncatalyzed system, while for the
   catalyzed system the long and medium branches have identical activation
   energies, and the short-branch system has the lowest activation energy.
   The addition of chloroform or increasing the butanol : TTI ratio results

Abstract = {{The dielectric alpha-relaxation of the poly(epichlorohydrin)/poly(vinyl
   methyl ether) miscible system is investigated in the frequency range
   10(-2)-10(6) Hz. This polymer blend has the particularity that the
   components have nearly coincident glass-transition temperatures. We
   found that the relaxation spectra of these blends can be well described
   by the Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts law, the shape parameter being nearly
   temperature independent. This means that the dynamical heterogeneity
   commonly reported for the alpha-relaxation of miscible polymer blends is
   not found in this system. Our results suggest that the main reason for
   the dynamical homogeneity observed in the blend investigated in this
   work is that the neat components have nearly coincident T-g values. This
   can be considered as proof of the relevance of the difference between
   T-g of the blend components in the origin of the heterogeneous behavior
   commonly observed for the polymer blend dynamics in the alpha-relaxation
   range.}},

Abstract = {{A number of case histories were recently brought to our attention which
   were intriguing professionally, yet presented difficulties in proving
   positive results: reported rape by an agressor wearing a condom. We
   undertook an indepth analysis of the chemical components of condoms and
   selected the lubricant for further study. In chemical terms, the
   silicone oil used, polymethylsiloxane, is clear, colorless and odorless.
   In this paper, we describe a technique for the detection of
   polymethylsiloxane. Given that the quantities of lubricant available, in
   vivo, were likely to be extremely small, we opted to use H-1-NMR. Our
   results confirm the range for identifying polymethylsiloxane as between
   0.0426-0.0440 ppm and two individual case histories gave figures of
   0.0424 ppm and 0.0420 ppm. Further studies are underway on the length of
   time polymethylsiloxane remains on the victim or clothing and on
   different detection techniques.}},

   several branches related to the faceting of the QWR boundaries. These

Abstract = {{Local field potentials were recorded in parietal cortex, areas 5, 7a and
   7b, of a macaque monkey to determine if oscillatory bursts occurred in
   an observable relationship to behavioral events. The monkey performed a
   visually-guided reaching task to targets displayed on a touch-sensitive
   video monitor. The task was pre-cued with a 1.6 s preparatory period.
   Intracortical recordings were made with a microelectrode or epidural
   recordings with silver ball electrodes. Compared to the relaxed state,
   task performance was distinguished by a drop in power for frequencies
   below 20 Hz (most prominent in area 7), and an increase for frequencies
   above 20 Hz. For the beta frequency band 20-25 Hz, maximal power
   occurred during the preparatory periods, and minimal power during reach
   performance. Above 30 Hz, reach preparation and performance episodes did
   not differ significantly in spectral power, except in parts of area 5
   where 40 Hz activity was observed to increase during movement. The
   spatial extent of the beta preparatory activity was monitored using an
   array of 15 epidural electrodes, positioned in 2 rows stretching from
   the arcuate sulcus to the lunate sulcus. During reach preparation,
   premotor cortex was found to be the major focus of increased power at 20
   Hz, whereas posterior parietal cortex was the dominant focus of
   increased power in the 21-29 Hz band. Although beta frequencies were
   most prevalent during early stages of motor preparation, the oscillatory
   bursts were not tightly time-locked to the visual signals. beta
   Frequencies may be associated with an internally-triggered process to
   prepare the upcoming movement.}},

Abstract = {{The present study used anterograde and retrograde tract tracing and
   immunohistochemistry to determine the efferent projections of
   corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons of Barrington's nucleus in
   the rat. Injections of Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin into
   Barrington's nucleus resulted in anterograde labeling in the dorsal
   motor nucleus of the vagus, periaqueductal gray, medial thalamic nuclei,
   lateral hypothalamus, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus,
   lateral preoptic area, and lateral septum. The retrograde tract tracer,
   fluorogold, injected into the lumbosacral spinal cord labeled many, but
   not all, CRH-immunoreactive neurons in Barrington's nucleus. Moreover,
   some Barrington's neurons that were retrogradely labeled from the spinal
   cord were not CRH-immunoreactive. Several CRH-immunoreactive
   Barrington's neurons were retrogradely labeled by fluorogold injections
   into the periaqueductal gray, and these were located predominantly in
   the dorsal part of the nucleus. Additionally, some CRH-immunoreactive
   Barrington's neurons were retrogradely labeled from fluorogold
   injections into the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. In contrast,
   fluorogold injections into the lateral hypothalamus, lateral preoptic
   area, or lateral septum did not result in double labeling of
   CRH-immunoreactive neurons in Barrington's nucleus. These results
   suggest that many, but not all, CRH-containing neurons of Barrington's
   nucleus project to the lumbosacral spinal cord. In addition to their
   previously documented projections to the spinal cord, these neurons may
   be a source of CRH in the periaqueductal gray and dorsal motor nucleus
   of the vagus. CRH projections of Barrington's nucleus may play a role in
   behavioral or autonomic aspects of stress responses, in addition to
   their proposed role in micturition. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{A disulphide bond was introduced into a single-chain Fv form of the

Abstract = {{Optical emissions from pulsed excimer laser induced plasma emanating
   from CuO target are studied by an Optical Multichannel Analyzer system
   in the context of its implications for thin him growth by Pulsed Laser
   Deposition. The plasma is generated in four different ambients viz.
   hydrogen, helium, oxygen (pressure of 100 mTorr in each case) and vacuum
   (2 x 10(-5) Torr) at different energy densities from 1 to 3.5 J/cm(2).
   The plasma constituents and their evolution in the growth space (i.e. at
   a distance of 1.5 cm from the target) has been studied. Various
   transitions corresponding to Cu(I), H(I), Cu(II) and O(II) are observed.
   The observation of strong transitions due to O(II) in the plasma formed
   in vacuum, hydrogen and helium suggests significant degree of ionization
   of atoms via molecular splitting and inverse Bremsstrahlung process
   during early plasma formation. The persistence of ionicity in the
   plasma. can be attributed to long recombination lifetimes for the
   specific conditions used. In the case of ablation in oxygen ambient a
   very significant and remarkably selective enhancement of the copper
   vapor lasing transition at 510.5 nm is observed which brings out the
   role of oxygen molecules in sustaining the radiation trapping condition.
   The changes in the concentrations of neutrals and ions as a function of
   the laser energy density are also examined. It is argued that
   impingement of ions/atoms in an excited state on the growing surface can
   potentially lead to localized energy deposition via non-radiative
   deexcitation resulting into enhancement of film quality and density.}},

Abstract = {{To rapidly characterise TEM-derived extended-spectrum beta-lactamases a
   fast and easy method using polymerase chain reaction-restriction
   fragment length polymorphism was developed. This method was validated
   with ten reference TEM-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. The
   mutations involved in TEM-20 and TEM-21, which were previously reported
   only with biochemical analysis, were then characterised. TEM-20 differed
   from TEM-19 by a silent mutation at position 925 (A for G), and TEM-21
   differed from TEM-3 and TEM-14 by a single mutation (G for A) in an
   unreported position 660, involving an amino acid substitution, arginine
   for histidine, at position 153. Moreover, a new extended-spectrum
   beta-lactamase conferring low resistance to ceftazidime (TEM-29), was
   described. TEM-29 derived from TEM-1, with an amino acid substitution,
   his-164. Finally, the combination of polymerase chain
   reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and plasmid analysis
   allowed us to investigate nosocomial outbreaks due to clinical isolates
   of multi-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in three hospitals.}},

Abstract = {{The fluctuation determinant which determines the preexponential factor

   three-dimensional high-temperature action including, in addition to
   temperature-dependent masses, the T Phi(3) one-loop contribution which
   makes the phase transition first order. The results show that this term
   (which has then to be subtracted from the exact result) gives the
   dominant contribution to the one-loop effective action. The remaining
   correction is of the order of, but in general larger than, the critical
   bubble action. The results for the Higgs field fluctuations are compared
   with those of an approximate heat kernel computation by Kripganz, Laser,
   and Schmidt; good agreement is found for small bubbles and strong
   deviations for large thin-wall bubbles.}},

   (QSKIP) structure is presented for operation in a low background
   environment. We project the QSKIP's spectral response to be limited by
   the Cooper pair binding energy, 2 Delta or about 32 mu m for YBCO. The
   QSKIP response and sensitivity are computed from the minimum of the
   Hamiltonian energy functional and linearized Rothwarf-Taylor equations.
   Photoresponse and sensitivity expressions are computed in terms of the
   quasiparticle lifetime and indicate background limited infrared
   performance at very low photon flux levels. At low temperatures and
   under background limited infrared performance conditions, the
   photoresponse is proportional to the number of absorbed photons.
   Operating the QSKIP in the Meissner state and below 50\% of the critical
   current limits the noise sources to fluctuations in the condensate
   population. With the noise and photoresponse equations, the QSKIP noise
   equivalent power is computed in terms of the characteristic lifetimes
   of: quasiparticle generation; quasiparticle recombination; anharmonic
   phonon decay; and phonon trapping. The calculated noise equivalent power
   for a YBCO QSKIP is about 2.5X10(-15) W/root Hz at 9 K. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{Rationale and objectives. Primary peripartum pelvic and low back pain is
   a common complaint of females. The etiologic relation between pain and
   pelvic stability has been shown in previous studies, but at present
   there is no objective clinical testing method to evaluate pelvic
   stability. Methods: In this study, a dynamic measurement method using
   sonoelasticity to assess the sacroiliac joint (SI) stiffness was tested
   in vivo in 14 healthy female volunteers, With the subjects in supine
   position vibrations were unilaterally applied to the anterior iliac
   spine, The vibrations were registered by a Colour Doppler Imaging (CDI)
   transducer over the ipsilateral SI joint, Since the threshold level of
   the apparatus has a direct relation with the power of the vibrations,
   the intensity of the vibrations (sonoelasticity) on the sacrum and ilium
   was measured indirectly in threshold units. The differences between the
   threshold values were accepted as the power loss of vibrations through
   the SI joint. One-way analysis of variance-test and T-test for paired
   samples were applied on the measurement results (P < 0.05). Results:
   Statistically, the results showed a satisfactory intra-individual
   reproducibility and inter-individual variability. There was no
   significant difference between the data derived from the left SI joint
   and right SI joint. Conclusions: Based on the promising results on
   healthy female volunteers, this method will be specifically used in
   future studies on patients with peripartum pelvic pain.}},

   the largest anthropogenic hydrological change in terms of the mass

   88 major reservoirs on length-of-day, polar motion, and low-degree
   gravitational coefficients. On an individual basis much smaller than
   geophysical signals in scale and magnitude, these anthropogenic effects
   prove to be non-negligible cumulatively, especially when considering the
   fact that our results represent underestimates of the reality. In
   particular, reservoir water has contributed a significant fraction in
   the total observed polar drift over the last 40 years.}},

   the joint null hypotheses. The third approach applies Dunnett's
   procedure to the binary data. We evaluated the actual overall type I
   error rates of the Freeman-Tukey test and Dunnett's procedure using both
   simulation and binomial calculations while we assessed those of the
   binomial approach using simulation. Based on their capability to
   preserve the desirable overall type I error rate, we provide
   recommendations regarding the choices among the three approaches for
   various occasions. In addition, we provide comments on the power of
   these three procedures.}},

Title = {{An historic subplinian phreatomagmatic eruption: The 1630 AD eruption of
   Furnas volcano, Sao Miguel, Azores}},

Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{69}},

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The 1630 AD eruption on the island of Sao Miguel in the Azores took
   place from a vent in the southern part of the 7 X 5 km caldera of Fumas
   volcano, Precursory seismic activity occurred at least 8 hours before
   the eruption began and was felt over 30 km away. This seismic activity
   caused extensive damage destroying almost all buildings within a 10 km
   radius and probably triggered landslides on the southern coast.
   The explosive activity lasted similar to 3 days and ashfall occurred as
   far as 550 km away. Published models yield a volume of 0.65 km(3) (DRE)
   for the explosive products. Throughout the course of the eruption more
   than six discrete airfall lapilli layers, each of subplinian magnitude,
   were generated by magmatic explosive activity. Dispersal directions
   initially to the west and finally northeast of the vent indicate a
   change in wind direction during the eruption, Isopleth maps suggest
   column heights of up to 14 km and wind speeds varying between <5 and 30
   m/s when compared to published plume models. On steep southern slopes (>
   20 degrees) at least one lapilli layer (L2) shows pinch and swell
   thickness variations, and rounded pumice clasts suggesting instant
   remobilisation as grain flows.
   Ash-rich layers with abundant accretionary lapilli and vesicular
   textures are interbedded with the lapilli layers and represent the
   deposits formed by phreatomagmatic phases that punctuated the purely
   magmatic activity. The ash-rich layers show lateral thickness
   variations, as well as cross-bedding and sand-wave structures suggesting
   that low-concentration, turbulent flows (surges) deposited material on
   topographic highs. These pyroclastic surges were probably responsible
   for the 80 people reported burned to death 4 km southwest of the vent.
   High-particle-concentration, non-turbulent pyroclastic flows were
   channelled down steep valleys to the southern coast contemporaneously
   with the low-concentration surges. The massive flow deposits (similar to
   2 m thick) pass laterally into thin, stratified, accretionary
   lapilli-rich ashes (similar to 20 cm thick) over 100 m horizontally.
   Lateral transition between thick massive and thin stratified facies
   occurs on a flat surface unconfined by topography indicating that the
   flows had an effective yield strength.
   Effusive activity followed the explosive activity building a trachytic
   lava dome with a volume of similar to 20 x 10(6) m(3) (0.02 km(3) DRE)
   within the confines of the tuff/pumice cone formed during the explosive
   phase, Historic records suggest that dome building occurred over a
   period of at least two months. Calculated durations for eruptive phases
   and the fluctuation in eruptive style suggest that the eruption was
   pulsatory which may have been controlled by variable magma supply to the
   surface.}},

Abstract = {{A structured model dedicated to fed-batch growth of baker's yeast is
   detailed in steady-state conditions. The simulated results for aerobic
   growth on mixtures of glucose and ethanol are provided. The model
   differentiates and identifies glucose utilisation (either
   oxido-reductive or by oxidation), state 1 and ethanol oxidation, state
   2. Ethanol can be oxidised when glucose concentration is below a certain
   value, s(crit), only; ethanol is excreted when glucose concentration
   exceeds s(crit). The amount of ethanol co-consummed with glucose is
   controled by s(crit) through the transition rate from X(1) to X(2). Two
   major novelities are introduced for modeling glucose metabolism. (1) The
   specific growth rate on glucose is constant, equal to D-crit, at low
   glucose concentrations, but follows Monod kinetics at high glucose
   concentrations. (2) Non-constant yields (i.e., Y-x/s and Y-e/s) are
   determined by means of dimensionless groups when the specific growth
   rate on glucose exceeds D-crit. The model is developed on experimentally
   easily accessible parameters found in the literature for Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae H1022. A remarkable prediction of the experimental data
   obtained by Rieger et al. (1983) (J. Gen. Microbiol. 129, 653-661) is
   highlighted. The simulations suggest that the specific growth rate on
   ethanol may be underestimated in limited respiratory capacity based
   models.}},

Abstract = {{Background Studies of patients with coronary artery disease and left
   ventricular dysfunction have shown that preoperative quantification of
   myocardial viability may be clinically useful to identify those patients
   who will benefit most from revascularization both functionally and
   prognostically. However, the relation between preoperative extent of
   viability and change in heart failure symptoms has not been documented
   carefully. We assessed the relation between the magnitude of improvement
   in heart failure symptoms after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG)
   and the extent of myocardial viability as assessed by use of
   quantitative analysis of preoperative positron emission tomography (PET)
   images.
   Methods and Results We studied 36 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy
   (mean left ventricular ejection fraction, 28+/-6\%) undergoing CABG.
   Preoperative extent and severity of perfusion abnormalities and
   myocardial viability (flow-metabolism mismatch) were assessed by use of
   quantitative analysis of PET images with N-13 ammonia and
   fluorine-18-deoxyglucose. Each patient's functional status was
   determined before and after CABG by use of a Specific Activity Scale.
   Mean perfusion defect size and severity were 63+/-13\% and 33+/-12\%,
   respectively. Total extent of a PET mismatch correlated linearly and
   significantly with percent improvement in functional status after CABG
   (r=.87, P<.0001). A blood flow-metabolism mismatch greater than or equal
   to 18\% was associated with a sensitivity of 76\% and a specificity of
   78\% for predicting a change in functional status after
   revascularization. Patients with large mismatches (greater than or equal
   to 18\%) achieved a significantly higher functional status compared with
   those with minimal or no PET mismatch (<5\%) (5.7+/-0.8 versus 4.9+/-0.7
   metabolic equivalents, P=.009). This resulted in an improvement of 107\%
   in patients with large mismatches compared with only 34\% in patients
   with minimal or no PET mismatch.
   Conclusions In patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, the magnitude of
   improvement in heart failure symptoms after CABG is related to the
   preoperative extent and magnitude of myocardial viability as assessed by
   use of PET imaging. Patients with large perfusion-metabolism mismatches
   exhibit the greatest clinical benefit after CABG.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic fields in five-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory compactified on
   a circle correspond to `'twisted'' identifications of five-dimensional
   Minkowski space. We show that a five-dimensional generalization of the
   Kerr solution can be analytically continued to construct an instanton
   that gives rise to two possible decay modes of a magnetic field. One
   decay mode is the generalization of the `'bubble decay'' of the
   Kaluza-Klein vacuum described by Witten. The other decay mode, rarer for
   weak fields, corresponds in four dimensions to the creation of
   monopole-antimonopole pairs. An instanton for the latter process is
   already known and is given by the analytic continuation of the
   Kaluza-Klein Ernst metric, which we show is identical to the
   five-dimensional Kerr solution. We use this fact to illuminate further
   properties of the decay process. It appears that fundamental fermions
   can eliminate the bubble decay of the magnetic field, while allowing the
   pair production of Kaluza-Klein monopoles.}},

Abstract = {{An analysis of cosmic string breaking with the formation of black holes
   attached to the ends reveals a remarkable feature: the black holes can
   be correlated or uncorrelated. We find that, as a consequence, the
   number-of-states enhancement factor in the action governing the
   formation of uncorrelated black holes is twice the one for a correlated
   pair. We argue that when an uncorrelated pair forms at the ends of the
   string, the physics involved is more analogous to thermal nucleation
   than to particle-antiparticle creation. Also, are analyze the process of
   intercommuting strings induced by black hole annihilation and merging.
   Finally, we discuss the consequences for grand unified strings. The
   process whereby uncorrelated black holes are formed yields a rate which
   significantly improves over those previously considered, but still not
   enough to modify string cosmology.}},

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Morphinone reductase, produced by Pseudomonas putida M10, catalyses the
   NADH-dependent saturation of the carbon-carbon double bond of morphinone
   and codeinone, and is believed to be involved in the metabolism of
   morphine and codeine. The structural gene encoding morphinone reductase,
   designated morB, was cloned from Ps, putida M10 genomic DNA by the use
   of degenerate oligonucleotide probes based on elements of the amino acid
   sequence of the purified enzyme. Sequence analysis and structural
   characteristics indicated that morphinone reductase is related to the
   flavoprotein alpha/beta-barrel oxidoreductases, and is particularly
   similar to Old Yellow Enzyme of Saccharomyces spp, and the related
   oestrogen-binding protein of Candida albicans. Expressed sequence tags
   from several plant species show high homology to these enzymes,
   suggesting the presence of a family of enzymes conserved in plants and
   fungi. Although related bacterial proteins are known, morphinone
   reductase appears to be more similar to the eukaryotic proteins.
   Morphinone reductase was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and has
   potential applications for the industrial preparation of semisynthetic
   opiates.}},

Abstract = {{Glycogenosis type II (GSD II, Pompe disease) is an autosomal recessive
   lysosomal storage disease that results from a deficiency of acid
   alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Patients with this disorder are unable to break
   down lysosomal glycogen, which consequently accumulates in the lysosome.
   To evaluate enzyme replacement therapy for GSD II patients, we have
   expressed human GAA cDNA in Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells utilising a
   vector that places the cDNA under the transcriptional control of the
   human polypeptide chain elongation factor la gene promoter. A clonal
   cell line that secreted precursor recombinant GAA at approximately 18 mg
   . l(-1). day(-1) was identified. The precursor recombinant GAA was
   purified to homogeneity, had a molecular mass of 110 kDa as measured by
   SDS/PAGE, and was shown to have pH optima and kinetic parameters similar
   to those of GAA purified from human tissues. The partial N-terminal
   amino acid sequence of recombinant GAA conformed to that derived from
   the nucleotide sequence of the cloned cDNA. The recombinant enzyme was
   taken up by cultured fibroblasts and skeletal muscle cells from GSD II
   patients, and was shown to correct the storage phenotype. Endocytosed
   GAA was localised to the lysosome and showed evidence of intracellular
   processing to a more mature form. Activity levels increased up to twice
   the normal value and uptake was prevented if cells were cultured in the
   presence of mannose 6-phosphate.}},

Abstract = {{A survey is given on typical `top-down' and `bottom-up' approaches to
   design nanostructured sensors which monitor different physical and
   chemical quantities. Particular emphasis is put on new materials and
   transducers for molecular recognition by chemical sensors. These convert
   chemical information into electronic signals by making use of suitable
   `key-lock' structures. This requires the control of surface structures
   of chemically sensitive materials down to the molecular scale under
   thermodynamically or kinetically controlled conditions. This in turn
   requires the molecular understanding of sensor mechanisms which is
   deduced from comparative microscopic, spectroscopic and sensor test
   studies on `prototype materials'. Selected case studies illustrate the
   common mechanisms of molecular recognition with electron conductors, ion
   conductors, mixed conductors, molecular cages, polymers and selected
   biomolecular function units.}},

   b.c.c, solid solution phase and the AB(2) type Laves phase, is designed
   as a variation of the `Laves phase related b.c.c. solid solution'.
   Observations of microstructure show that Zr0.5Ti0.5 VMn consists of
   three phases: matrix C14, colonies of b.c.c. and small particle of
   alpha-ZrO2. In pressure-composition isotherms, a linear combination of

   found at any equilibrium pressure studied. Crystal structure and

Abstract = {{(Ti, Al) alloy nitride films have drawn much attention because of their
   excellent oxidation resistance. The purpose of this paper is to
   investigate the structure, morphology and composition of the (TiXAl1-XNY
   films prepared by r.f. reactive sputtering using a composite target
   where the area ratio of Ti to Al is unity. Nitrogen flow to total
   nitrogen and argon flow ratio (F-N2/F-total) is used as a parameter. The
   partial pressures of these gases that resulted were monitored by their
   optical emission in the glow discharge.
   The crystallographic structure of deposited films were divided into
   three groups by the F-N2/F-total that was used in their preparation. The
   first group (F-N2/F-total=0) is a Ti and Al metal mixed structure. The
   second group (0.1 less than or equal to F-N2/F-total < 0.4) has an
   amorphous structure. The last group (F-N2/F-total greater than or equal
   to 0.4) has the wurtzite structure. Under all conditions, the
   composition of the films was richer in Al than the target area ratio of
   Ti to Al, as would be expected from their sputtering yields. This ratio
   changes with admission of nitrogen because of selective poisoning (the
   formation of nitrides on the sputtering target). The plot of composition
   ratio C-Ti/C-Al vs. F-N2/F-total showed the local minimum at about
   F-N2/F-total = 0.3. The ratio of Ti to Al emission intensity, I-Ti/I-Al,
   from optical measurements shows excellent agreement with C-Ti/C-Al. It
   is concluded that the optical emission signal is very useful for the
   composition control during deposition, both of the materials being
   sputtered and of the residual atmosphere.}},

Abstract = {{1. Nitric oxide (NO), an inhibitory neurotransmitter released from
   peripheral neurones, hyperpolarizes smooth muscle cells and inhibits
   contraction. The mechanism of this hyperpolarization is unknown.
   2. We have identified three classes of K+ channels activated by NO and
   NO donors in colonic smooth muscle cells. NO and NO donors increased the
   open probability of 80 pS channels (K-NO1), very small channels (< 4 pS,
   K-NO2), and 270 pS Ca2+-activated K+ channels (BK channels) in
   cell-attached patches.
   3. Dibutyryl cGMP and 8-bromo cGMP also increased the open probability
   of K-NO1, and K-NO2, in cell-attached patches.
   4. In excised patches of membrane, direct application of NO or the NO
   donor, S-nitroso-N-acetyl penicillamine (SNAP), increased the open
   probability of K-NO1 and K-NO2, but cGMP or dibutyryl cGMP had no
   effect. SNAP had no effect on the open probability of BK channels in
   excised patches.
   5. The reducing agent dithiothreitol and the alkylating agent
   N-ethylmaleimide blocked NO-induced channel openings.
   6. In summary, the hyperpolarization response to NO in smooth muscles
   may be mediated by multiple K+ channels. At least two of these classes
   of channels may be activated by dual pathways involving direct
   activation by NO and cGMP-mediated mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Tumor suppressor protein p53 binds to DNA in a sequence-specific manner
   and activates transcription from promoters near its binding site. It is
   also known to repress promoters lacking the p53-binding site. In this
   study, we demonstrate that p53 can act as a transcriptional activator or
   repressor in vivo using the same reporter with the DNA-binding site CON
   and these effects depend on the amount of p53 expressed. Both in Saos2
   and Cos7 cells, lower concentrations of p53 lead to activation and
   higher concentrations lead to repression of the model promoter
   containing the consensus p53-binding site CON. The N-terminal part of
   p53 is necessary for the transcriptional activation. It is not needed,
   however, for the repression of the same promoter, indicating that
   different domains of p53 are involved in activation and repression.}},

Abstract = {{Prevention of hyperacute xenograft rejection in the pig-to-primate
   combination has been accomplished by removal of natural antibodies,
   complement depletion with cobra venom factor, or prevention of C3
   activation with the soluble complement inhibitor sCR1. Although these
   strategies effectively prevent hyperacute rejection, they do not address
   the relative contribution of early (C3a, C3b) versus late (C5a, C5b-9)
   activated complement components to xenogeneic organ damage. To better
   understand the role of the terminal complement components (C5a, C5b-9)
   in hyperacute rejection, an anti-human C5 mAb was developed and tested
   in an ex vivo model of cardiac xenograft rejection, In vitro studies
   demonstrated that the anti-C5 mAb effectively blocked C5 cleavage in a
   dose-dependent manner that resulted in complete inhibition of both C5a
   and C5b-9 generation, Addition of anti-C5 mAb to human blood used to
   perfuse a porcine heart prolonged normal sinus cardiac rhythm from a
   mean time of 25.2 min in hearts perfused with unmodified blood to 79,
   296, or >360 min when anti-C5 mAb was added to the blood at 50 mu g/ml,
   100 mu g/ml, or 200 mu g/ml, respectively, In these experiments,
   activation of the classical complement pathway was completely inhibited,
   Hearts perfused with blood containing the highest concentration of
   anti-C5 mAb had no histologic evidence of hyperacute rejection and no
   deposition of C5b-9, These experiments suggest that the activated
   terminal complement components C5a and C5b-9, but not C3a or C3b, play a
   major role in tissue damage in this porcine-to-human model of hyperacute
   rejection, They also suggest that targeted inhibition of terminal
   complement activation by anti-C5 mAbs may be useful in clinical
   xenotransplantation.}},

Abstract = {{An accurate calculation of bound and resonance spectra of the
   non-rotating odd O-2 exchange symmetry HO2 radical is presented. The
   calculation has been carried out by a recently developed iterative
   technique which uses filter diagonalization of a sparse matrix of the
   system Hamiltonian with absorbing boundary conditions, We were able to
   obtain 361 bound states and some 232 isolatable resonances (Gamma<0.01
   eV) in a wide energy range corresponding to the HO2-->H+O-2 unimolecular
   decomposition reaction. It is shown that all resonances found have the
   same nature as the bound states in that they ail are localized in the
   same region of space over the deep potential well, and moreover the
   extrapolated smoothed density of the bound states merges easily with the
   smoothed density of the resonance states. The level statistics for both
   bound and resonance states indicates a highly chaotic regime consistent
   with the random matrix theory. Strong mode mixing makes assignments of
   most bound and resonance states impossible because the corresponding
   wave functions do not show any simple pattern. Interestingly, the
   randomly fluctuating high resolution density of states after smoothing
   shows a structure resembling two basic frequencies corresponding to the
   O-2 stretch and HOO bend motion of the HO2 molecule. (C) 1995 American

Abstract = {{The variation of retention of a single protein, either
   positively-charged (lysozyme) or negatively-charged (bovine serum
   albumin, BSA) in a buffer solution at pH 7 was investigated by varying
   the ionic strength with unmodified or chemically-modified zirconia UF
   membranes. Chemical modification was obtained by coating
   polyvinylimidazole the amine group of which reacted further with
   bisepoxiranes in order to have, both, a partly quaternized amine group
   and a pH-stable network on the membrane surface. Zeta potentials of
   zirconia-based materials with a positive polymer coating was dependent
   on the nature of the electrolyte. For elucidating the mechanism of
   protein retention, an HPLC study with similar coatings was performed.
   Salt-promoted interactions between protein and the cross-linker used
   with the polymer were shown at high salt content in the phosphate buffer
   and displacement of these interactions was achieved with acetonitrile.
   Retention of lysozyme or BSA is well-fitted with a model of ionic
   strength controlled retention (ISCR) based on a three term equation
   corresponding roughly to size effect, electrostatic and salt-promoted
   interactions the physical meaning of which is discussed. At low ionic
   strength, when protein retention is far higher than expected on size
   retention, the free protein acts as a co-ion of the fouled membrane and
   electrostatic interactions are accounted for with the leading retention
   term depending on l(-1/2) according to the model. Protein retention with
   unmodified hydrophilic membranes is close to size retention with
   increasing ionic strength. However, protein retention is U-shaped with a
   minimum larger than size retention when ionic strength induces
   salt-promoted interactions between protein and the polymer coating on
   the membrane surface. Finally, it is pointed out that phosphate buffer
   allows lysozyme retention to be close to (or lower than) the size
   retention at low ionic strength as modified membranes are presumably
   negatively-charged. The application of the model involving attractive
   forces between protein and modified surface rather than repulsive forces
   is under investigation.}},

   different exchange-correlation functionals have been performed to

   GeH2, and SnH2. Geometrical structures as well as vibrational
   frequencies are in agreement with the available experimental data and
   compare favorably with the most sophisticated post-Hartree-Fock
   computations performed until now. Both computed Ips (9.15 and 9.25 eV
   for SiH2 and GeH2, respectively) and EA of SiH2 (1.17 eV) compare
   favorably with experimental data (9.17, 9.21, and 1.2 eV). Accurate
   values are obtained also for singlet-triplet energy gaps. We report for
   the first time the electron affinities of all neutral systems and the

   bromosulphophthalein (BSP) in rats on the biliary secretion of lipids to
   clarify the regulatory mechanism(s). Each rat was equipped with a
   bile-duct cannula to collect bile, After the endogenous bile salt pool
   was depleted, STC was infused at a constant rate (160 nmol/min per 100 g
   body wt.) with or without BSP (50, 100, or 150 nmol/min per 100 g body
   wt.). BSP reduced the biliary secretion of cholesterol and phospholipids
   dose-dependently without affecting the secretion of bile salts
   (uncoupling phenomenon), Compared with the physiological and STC-infused
   condition, the biliary cholesterol/phospholipid. ratio and
   saturated/unsaturated fatty acid ratio increased under the bile salts
   depletion and uncoupling phenomenon. Data indicate that the
   hydrophobicity of biliary lecithin increases with a decrease in the bile
   salt micelle capacity to induce biliary lipid secretion, resulting in a
   higher packing density of biliary vesicle. The cholesterol-holding
   capacity of the biliary vesicle is therefore enhanced during the
   depletion of bile salts and the uncoupling phenomenon.}},

   (n = 4, 5, and 9) in the {[}001] direction by Pb atoms. The Pb atoms in
   between are lined up in the {[}<(1) over bar 10>] direction. The p(4 x

   substitutional rows of Pb atoms and one with a simple overlayer
   structure without substituted rows of Cu atoms. Alternating succession
   of these two modifications results in p(12 x 1) domains. It is further
   shown that the p(9 x 1) structure is not a succession of p(4 x 1) and
   p(5 x 1) but a superstructure on its own. The p(5 x 1) structure
   proposed here agrees with previous x-ray-diffraction data at least as

Abstract = {{The results of renal cadaver transplants performed between 1984 and 1994
   and reported to the Collaborative Transplant Study were analyzed to
   examine the effect of rejection prophylaxis with OKT3. OKT3 prophylaxis
   with sequential (i.e., delayed) addition of cyclosporine (CsA), compared
   with immunosuppressive treatment that included CsA but not OKT3,
   resulted in a significantly higher overall S-year graft survival rate in
   recipients of first transplants (75+/-1\% vs, 71+/-1\%, respectively;
   P<0.0001) and in recipients of retransplants (68+/-2\% vs, 62+/-1\%,
   respectively; P<0.001), In contrast, the simultaneous administration of
   OKT3 and CsA from the first posttransplant day did not result in
   improved graft survival over treatment with CsA alone, Graft survival
   rates were significantly associated with matching for HLA-A, -B, and -DR
   antigens in both first and retransplant recipients treated with a
   sequential protocol of OKT3/CsA (P<0.01). Among patients with preformed
   panel reactive lymphocytotoxic antibodies >50\%, significantly better
   3-year graft survival rates were obtained with sequential OKT3/CsA than
   were achieved without OKT3 in first transplant recipients (80+/-5\% vs,
   63+/-1\%, respectively; P<0.001) and in retransplant recipients
   (73+/-5\% vs, 58+/-1\%, respectively; P<0.01), Significantly improved
   3-year graft survival rates with OKT3 and sequential CsA were likewise
   obtained in two other groups of high-risk patients: black recipients
   (P<0.001) and pediatric recipients (P<0.01), The results demonstrate an
   advantage for OKT3 prophylaxis in conjunction with delayed CsA therapy

Abstract = {{Human gelatinase B was produced from peripheral blood neutrophils and
   purified by affinity chromatography on gelatin sepharose. This material
   was used as an antigen to prepare mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAb). The
   resulting hybridomas were selected on the basis of binding to
   biotinylated antigen and by a sandwich ELISA using gelatinase-B-specific
   polyclonal rabbit antiserum and pure natural antigen, Five of these mAb
   were selected for further characterization. They al displayed variable
   epitope specificity, binding capacity and inhibitory activity. Whereas
   mAb REGA-2D9 and REGA-3G12 showed the strongest binding to biotinylated
   gelatinase B and natural gelatinase B, respectively, mAb REGA-2F9 did
   not bind biotinylated antigen. None of the mAb displayed
   cross-reactivity to gelatinase A in a direct ELISA. The mAb REGA-1G8 was
   found to cross-react with human serum albumin. The binding capacity of
   the other four mAb with leukocyte gelatinase B was compared and a
   sensitive sandwich ELISA was developed with the antibodies REGA-3G12 and
   REGA-2D9 (detection limit 0.5 ng/ml). The mAb REGA-3G12 was unique in
   that it inhibited catalysis by gelatinase B, This was shown by assaying
   the degradation of nasal septum type II gelatin in the presence and
   absence of each of the five mAb. Furthermore, mAb RECA-3G12 inhibited
   the degradation of biotinylated gelatin in a microtiterplate solution
   assay. In addition to the potential use of the inhibitory mAb REGA-3G12
   in the treatment of diseases with excessive gelatinase B production,
   several of the described mAb are useful as diagnostic probes to detect
   gelatinase B in body fluids and tissue samples of patients with multiple
   sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and cancer.}},

Abstract = {{THE aim of the present study was to describe the distribution of
   dopamine (DA) fibres in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and to determine
   their neurones of origin. Using an anti-DA antibody, we observed a
   moderate density of DA varicose fibres over the DRN and a dense plexus
   of DA fibres in the ventrolateral central grey. With a sensitive
   retrograde tracing technique combining the use of cholera toxin subunit
   b with tyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry, after tracer
   injections in the DRN, a few double-labelled cells were observed in the
   ventral tegmental area and the A10 dorsocaudal DA cell group, as already
   described. In addition, a moderate number of double-labelled cells was
   seen in the All hypothalamic DA cell group.}},

Abstract = {{Background Although intracoronary ultrasound (ICUS) has been validated
   for the early detection of transplant coronary artery disease (TxCAD),
   the prognostic importance of findings detected by this new imaging
   technique is unknown.
   Methods and Results This study examined the relation of clinical outcome
   in 145 heart transplant recipients (mean age, 45.1+/-11.1 years) with
   the amount of intimal thickness measured by ICUS during routine annual
   coronary angiography 1 to 10 years (mean, 3.1+/-2.2 years) after
   transplantation. From published autopsy data, a mean intimal thickness
   of >0.3 mm was considered significant. During a mean follow-up time of
   48.2+/-10.2 months, 23 deaths (12 cardiac) occurred, and 6 patients
   required retransplantation. Angiographic TxCAD developed in 22 of 125
   patients (17.6\%) in the subgroup with normal angiograms at the time of
   ICUS and a follow-up annual angiographic study, In the total population
   and the subgroup, mean intimal thicknesses of >0.3 and less than or
   equal to 0.3 mm, respectively, were associated with significantly
   inferior 4-year actuarial overall survival (73\% versus 96\%, P=.005;
   72\% versus 92\%, P=.05), cardiac survival (79\% versus 96\%, P=.005;
   80\% versus 98\%, P=.04), and freedom from cardiac death and
   retransplantation (74\% versus 98\%, P<.0001; 70\% versus 96\%, P=.001).
   In addition, ICUS predicted freedom from development of subsequent
   angiographic TxCAD in the subgroup that was initially normal (26\%
   versus 72\%, P=.02). A mean intimal thickness by ICUS of >0.3 mm was
   associated with inferior clinical outcome regardless of the presence of
   angiographic TxCAD and predicted the development of subsequent
   angiographic TxCAD. Despite significantly longer duration after
   transplantation, higher rejection incidence, and lower average daily
   cyclosporine dose, none of these covariates were independent risk
   factors for outcome.
   Conclusions These findings confirm the prognostic importance of mean
   intimal thickening of >0.3 mm in heart transplant recipients and suggest
   that these patients should be candidates for early interventional
   strategies.}},

   and photodesorption of H+ ions as functions of photon energy were
   measured from condensed layers of varied thicknesses (100 ML, 10 ML, I
   ML on a 1 ML Xe spacer layer). Clear evidence for repulsive (or at most
   extremely weakly bound) core excitations for NH3, and for bound core
   excitations with vibrational resolution for CH4, has been obtained.
   Surface and bulk excitations can be well distinguished using the graded
   surface sensitivity of the two signals from the various layers. For the
   surface excitations, surface symmetry breaking both in terms of
   electronic and vibronic states has been deduced from
   polarization-dependent behaviour. Possible information on Rydberg and

Abstract = {{The simplified perturbed hard chain theory (SPHCT) equation of state
   (EOS) possesses several attractive features. We have been exploring
   possible modifications to the equation to improve its performance for
   both equilibrium and volumetric property calculations. (In a companion
   study, we have outlined our strategies for modifying the SPHCT EOS.) As
   a precursor to our study of modifications to the SPHCT EOS, we (a)
   developed a robust solution algorithm for the SPHCT, (b) established a
   novel approach to solving the critical-point constraint equations, and
   (c) performed a parameter sensitivity analysis study for the equation,
   each of which is described in the present work, These results provided
   valuable guidance to our efforts in modifying the SPHCT EOS, which are
   presented in a companion article.
   The robust algorithm developed for solution of the SPHCT EOS employs a
   solution equation written in terms of the compressibility factor. This
   algorithm exhibits better behavior near both the liquid and vapor roots
   than previous solution equations. However, this robust behavior requires
   increased computation time during parameter regressions.
   The SPHCT parameter sensitivity analysis shows that the characteristic
   temperature (T{*}) and the maximum coordination number (Z(M)) have very
   strong influences on calculated vapor pressures and phase densities.
   Further, application of the critical constraints yields more stable
   parameterization than is obtained by utilizing the SPHCT equation in its
   original form.
   Simple correlations are presented for solving the critical point
   constraints. The correlations (a) significantly reduce computational
   time and complexity and (b) facilitate application of the critical point
   constraints without the need to embed complicated numerical routines
   within existing EOS computer codes.}},

   determined the concordance of diagnoses between 2 biopsy samples from

   Two core samples from the same allograft biopsy procedure were labeled
   as core A and core B and presented to both unblinded and blinded
   pathologists, and each pathologist independently assigned an acute and a
   chronic rejection grade, A set of clinical data with pertinent prebiopsy
   information was combined with either the core A or core B
   histopathological diagnosis and presented to 3 transplant nephrologists
   who made treatment recommendations for each combination, Two cores were
   obtained in 79 allograft biopsies, Core pairs differed by greater than
   or equal to 1 grade of acute rejection in 30\% and 50\% of cases for
   unblinded and blinded pathologist readings, respectively, Moderate or
   severe acute rejection would have been missed with a 1 core in 9.5\% of
   cases, increasing to 25.6\% if only biopsy pairs containing at least 1
   reading of moderate or severe acute rejection are included, Therapy
   would have failed to be increased with a single core in 7.5\% of cases,
   increasing to 10.5\% if only pairs containing at least one
   recommendation of an increase in therapy are included, The use of 2
   cores of renal allograft tissue provides better diagnostic information
   and thereby leads to appropriate increases in antirejection therapy
   without increasing the complication rate of the procedure.}},

Abstract = {{At least 30 G protein-linked receptors stimulate phosphatidylinositol
   4,5-bisphosphate phosphodiesterase (phospholipase CP, PLCP) through G
   protein subunits to release intracelylular calcium from the endoplasmic
   reticulum (Clapham, D. E. (1995) Cell 80, 259-268). Although both G
   alpha and G beta gamma G protein subunits have been shown to activate
   purified PLC beta in vitro, G alpha q has been presumed to mediate the
   pertussis toxin-insensitive response in vivo. In this study, we show
   that G beta gamma plays a dominant role in muscarinic-mediated
   activation of PLC beta by employing the Xenopus oocyte expression
   system. Antisense nucleotides and antibodies to G alpha q/11 blocked the
   ms-mediated signal transduction by inhibiting interaction of the
   muscarinic receptor with the G protein. Agents that specifically bound
   free G beta gamma subunits (G alpha-GDP and a beta-adrenergic receptor
   kinase fragment) inhibited acetylcholine-induced signal transduction to

Abstract = {{Temperature- and potential-controlled phase transitions of a thin film
   of a redox gel prepared from copolymerization of N-isopropylacrylamide,
   vinylferrocene, and N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide at a Au electrode, were
   monitored by in situ phase measurement interferometric microscopy
   (PMIM). The thickness and width of the gel film in a NaClO4 solution
   decreased from similar to 10 and similar to 160 mu m, respectively, at
   temperatures below 20 degrees C, to similar to 4 and similar to 120 mu
   m, respectively, above 30 degrees C. Electrochemical oxidation of the
   ferrocene groups in the polymer gel (to positively charged ferrocenium)
   is shown to result in a similar to 5 degrees C increase in the
   temperature at which the volume changes occurred. A reversible
   potential-dependent volume change at constant temperature was also
   observed using PMIM. The results are discussed in terms of the
   dependency of hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions of the polymer

   mobility K-o and the ratios of the longitudinal and transverse diffusion
   coefficients to mobility, D-L/K and D-T/K respectively, were calculated
   for both Rb+-Ne and Rb+-Ar systems with a Monte Carlo simulation (MCS)
   technique which used the interaction potential of Koutselos, Mason and
   Viehland (KMV) (J. Chem. Phys., 93 (1990) 7125) as input. The accuracy
   of this potential has been evaluated by comparing the D-T/K results to
   the experimentally determined values. The KMV potential appears to be a
   good representation of the actual potential in the whole E/N range
   (5-500 Td) for Rb+-Ne but only in the 5-350 Td range for Rb+-Ar. Values
   of D-L/K and D-T/K were also derived using K-o obtained from the present
   MCS calculations and from experimental data available in the literature,
   employing the generalised Einstein relations (GER) based on the
   three-temperature theory. In the E/N range studied for both Rb+-Ne and
   Rb+-Ar systems, the accuracy of the experimental measurements of D-T/K
   is estimated to be +/-3\% and that of the MCS calculations to be

Abstract = {{A comprehensive genome scan for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 33 renal
   cell carcinomas indicates that mutations of tumor suppressor genes on
   several different chromosomes are required for malignant transformation
   in this disease, In the case of nonpapillary renal carcinomas
   chromosomes 3p, 6q, 8p, 9pq, and 14q exhibit elevated levels of LOH.
   Although 3p is the most frequently lost chromosome arm, in no case is 3p
   observed as the sole allelic loss because it always occurs in
   conjunction with the loss of either 6q, 8p, or 14q, This result
   indicates that the mutation of a tumor suppressor gene on 3p, most
   likely von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL), may be necessary but is not
   sufficient for the development of nonpapillary renal cell carcinoma.
   In papillary renal tumors, LOH is observed most often for chromosomes
   6pq, 9p, 11q, 14q, and 21q. This suggests that tumor suppressor genes
   located on chromosomes 6q, 9pq, and 14q may be involved in the
   development and/or progression of both nonpapillary and papillary renal
   cell carcinomas, However, LOH in papillary tumors appears to be
   especially elevated for 11q and 21q and reduced for 3p and 8p indicating
   that there are also tumor suppressor genes specific to each form of the
   disease. There is no correlation between stage of disease and the extent
   of LOH, loss of a particular chromosome, or the number of chromosomes
   that show allele inbalance, Early and late stage tumors may exhibit
   either extensive LOB or no apparent allele loss; similarly, allelic
   imbalances are observed in both early and late stage renal cell
   carcinomas. This suggests that a gene (or genes) regulating mitotic
   chromosome stability may be mutated in some renal tumors. Preliminary
   evidence points to an association between genome instability and LOH of
   14q.
   Finally, a distinct type of microsatellite instability has been detected
   in 21\% of renal cell carcinomas and occurs at a frequency of 4.4 x
   10(-4)/ locus, The most common mutation is a 2-bp insertion in a CA
   repeat, This alteration is not restricted to a particular histopathology
   or clinical stage, and it is not associated with allelic loss of a
   specific chromosome, The frequency of this event is similar to that
   which occurs spontaneously in germline microsatellite loci and is
   probably not the result of a defect in a mismatch repair gene, It is
   possible that this type of microsatellite instability is general and may
   occur in most, if not all, carcinomas.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we used Raman spectroscopy to investigate the structural
   characteristics of as-deposited amorphous and micro-crystalline silicon
   films. For amorphous silicon films, the order (or disorder) of the
   silicon network was quantified using properties of the Raman spectra
   that were related to key deposition conditions. We found that a strong
   relationship exists between the structural order of the silicon matrix
   and the deposition temperature and deposition rate. A quantitative model
   was proposed relating the intensity ratio of transverse optical phonon
   peak to longitudinal optical phonon peak to the surface diffusion
   length, a parameter that was calculated from available data. It was
   found that optimization of the as-deposited silicon microstructure is
   possible by selecting deposition conditions yielding peak-ratio values
   in the vicinity of 0.53. For as-deposited micro-crystalline silicon
   films, Raman spectroscopy was used to estimate the initial crystalline
   fraction of the film and monitor the crystallization process during
   annealing. These data were used to confirm the crystallization mechanism
   in mixed-phase silicon films and identify the effect of different
   process parameters on the crystallization time of the annealed films.

   stocking sizes were 3.9, 10.8 and 16.0 g, respectively. Shrimp growth
   and feeding rate increased directly with temperature in each experiment,
   but the increases varied among the three size classes so that thermal
   effects on growth and feeding were size-specific. FCR of small shrimp
   was not different among the three test temperatures while FCR of
   medium-and large-sized shrimp varied with temperature. Differences in
   growth response among size classes was the basis for a fourth
   experiment, in which two size classes were, grown at three temperatures.
   Growth and feeding rate were again directly related to temperature and
   varied inversely with size. FCR was primarily related to size; larger
   shrimp grew less efficiently. Large temperature coefficients,
   particularly between 23 and 27 degrees C, demonstrate that P. vannamei
   growth is extremely sensitive to small changes in temperature. These
   data also indicate that temperature optima (temperature of fastest
   growth) is size-specific and decreases as shrimp size increases. For
   small shrimp ( < 5 g), temperature optima may be greater than 30 degrees
   C while for large shrimp, the temperature optimum is about 27 degrees C.
   These findings appear consistent with the distribution of P. vannamei
   during its natural life history. For P. vannamei farmers, these data
   indicate that for all sizes reduced growth and feeding can be expected
   when pond temperature is below 23 degrees C and for large shrimp when
   pond temperature is 30 degrees C or greater.}},

   The dependence of the magnetic moment on hydrogen content and magnetic

   maintained in the hydrides, but the curvature of the DOS curve is
   slightly modified in the beta phase (x = 1.0-1.9), and more strongly

   is related to the occupation sites of hydrogen. The electronic
   population in the 3d band is hardly changed upon hydrogenation, and it
   is about + 0.1 electron Co-1 per absorbed hydrogen atom. The electrons
   originating from hydrogen atoms are almost contained in the

Abstract = {{We have shown that the 105-kDa heat shock protein (HSP105) and the 42
   degrees C-specific heat shock protein (42 degrees C-HSP) constitute high
   molecular mass heat-shock proteins. To elucidate the structure of these
   heat shock proteins, are have screened a cDNA library constructed with
   poly(A)(+) RNA derived from mouse FM3A cells preheated at 32 degrees C
   for 2 h using an antibody against murine HSP105. Two full-length cDNA
   clones were obtained: the pB105-1 insert encoded an 858-amino acid
   protein, and the pB105-2 insert encoded an 814-amino acid protein and
   lacked 44 amino acids found in pB105-1. The two clones contained the
   amino acid sequence found in the 17-kDa polypeptide fragments from
   HSP105 and 42 degrees C-HSP by lysylendopeptidase digestion. In vitro
   translation products of the RNA transcripts from pB105-1 and pB105-2
   migrated to the same positions of HSP105 and 42 degrees C-HSP,
   respectively, on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Northern blot
   analysis showed that the transcript was similar to 4 kilobases in murine
   FM3A cells and was strongly induced by heat shock and by treatment with
   arsenite or an amino acid analog. By reverse transcription-polymerase
   chain reaction analysis using primers by which deletion of 132
   nucleotides in pB105-2 could be detected, the polymerase chain reaction
   product corresponding to pB105-2 was increased only after heat shock at
   42 degrees C, whereas the product corresponding to pB105-1 was induced
   by heat shock at-either 42 or 45 degrees C and also by other stresses.
   Thus, the cDNA clones pB105-1 and pB105-2 encode HSP105 and 42 degrees
   C-HSP, respectively, and HSP105 and 42 degrees C-HSP (a short form of
   HSP105) are suggested to be produced by alternative splicing, Here,
   HSP105 and 42 degrees C-HSP are renamed HSP105 alpha and HSP105 beta,
   respectively, A protein sequence homology search revealed that HSP105
   shares 54, 34, and 25\% amino acid identity with human HSP70RY, the sea
   urchin egg receptor for sperm, and murine inducible HSP70, respectively.
   Furthermore, by Northern blot analysis, HSP105 mRNA was revealed to be
   present in most murine tissues and to be highly expressed in the brain.}},

Abstract = {{Incubation of hepatocytes or the SV40-DNA-immortalized hepatocyte P9
   cell line with cholera toxin led to a time-dependent activation of
   adenylate cyclase activity, which occurred after a defined lag period.
   When added together with cholera toxin, each of the hormones insulin and
   vasopressin was capable of attenuating the maximum stimulatory effect
   achieved by cholera toxin over a period of 60 min through a process
   which could be blocked by the compounds staurosporine and chelerythrine.
   Attenuating effects on cholera-toxin-stimulated adenylate cyclase
   activity could also be elicited by using either the protein kinase C
   (PKC)-stimulating phorbol ester PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) or
   the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid. Alkaline phosphatase
   treatment of membranes reversed the inhibitory effect of PMA. Cholera
   toxin also stimulated the adenylate cyclase activity of intact CHO
   (Chinese-hamster ovary) and NIH-3T3 cells, but this activity was
   insensitive to the addition of PMA. Overexpression of various PKC
   isoforms in CHO cell lines did not confer sensitivity to inhibition by
   PMA upon cholera-toxin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. Rather,
   overexpression of the gamma isoform of PKC allowed PMA to stimulate
   adenylate cyclase activity in CHO cells. It is suggested that the
   PKC-mediated phosphorylation of a membrane protein attenuates
   cholera-toxin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in hepatocytes and
   P9 cells. The cellular selectivity of such an action may be due to the
   target for this inhibitory action of PKC being a particular isoform of
   adenylate cyclase which provides the major activity in hepatocytes and
   P9 cells, but not in either CHO or NIH-3T3 cells.}},

Abstract = {{This paper dears with the absorption and defocusing of a CO2 laser beam
   by the laser-induced plasma plume in deep penetration welding. To derive
   the `effective' intensity distribution in the focal plane theoretically,
   the laser beam propagation through the plasma plume is calculated by
   solving the paraxial wave equation with a finite-difference scheme.
   Corresponding to experimental results, documented in the literature, the
   properties of the plasma plume (spatial temperature distribution and
   shielding gas content) are pre-set within the calculation. Parametric
   studies demonstrate that the intensity at the focus is reduced due to
   the defocusing effect of the plasma plume, mainly, and only to a minor
   extent due to absorption within the plume. Because of refraction within
   the plume, the intensity distribution in the focal plane is dependent on
   the plasma's size, position and temperature. On studying the dependency
   of the optical properties on plasma temperature and shielding gas
   composition, it is found that, by applying a shielding gas mixture of He
   and Ar in the ratio 3:1, the variation of the focal diameter with plasma
   temperature can be significantly reduced. This shielding gas mixture,
   therefore, is recommended for enhancing process stability when welding
   with high-power CO2 lasers.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports for the first time an accurate theoretical scheme for
   obtaining directly the inner-sphere reorganization energies for the
   electron self-exchange reactions from ionization potentials and electron
   affinities. The total innersphere reorganization energy consists of two
   contributions: the reorganization energy of the oxidized species and
   that of the reduced species. The former corresponds to the relevant
   ionization potentials of the reduced species, and the latter to the
   relevant electron affinities of the oxidized species. The ionization
   potentials and electron affinities may be obtained from their
   photoelectron spectra or alternatively from the vibration-rotation
   spectroscopic data via accurate potential functions for the second row
   diatomic hydrides (redox pairs) when the relevant ionization or excited
   energies of the dissociated products (atoms) of these redox species are
   available. The inner-sphere reorganization energy values are calculated
   for the electron self-exchange reactions HA + HA(+) (A = Be, B, C, N, O
   and F) and compared with those from other classical calculation methods.}},

Abstract = {{COCAINE is a powerfully addictive substance and new strategies are
   needed to treat its abuse. Generating an active immunization(1,2) to
   cocaine offers a means of blocking the actions of the drug by preventing
   it from entering the central nervous system, and should have fewer side
   effects than treatments based on manipulation of central
   neurotransmitter function. The design and preparation of a cocaine
   immunogen requires special regard for the stability of cocaine both free
   and as a haptenic determinant. Immunochemistry and a well defined
   behavioural model were brought together to address the problem of
   inactivation of the psychostimulant actions of cocaine. We report here
   that active immunization with a new, stable cocaine conjugate suppressed
   locomotor activity and stereotyped behaviour in rats induced by cocaine
   but not by amphetamine, Moreover, following acute injection of cocaine,
   levels of cocaine in the striatum and cerebellum of the immunized
   animals were lower than those of control animals, These results suggest
   that immunopharmacotherapy may be a promising means by which to explore
   new treatments for cocaine abuse.}},

Abstract = {{Hydroperoxide formation during Maillard reaction (amino-carbonyl
   reaction) was investigated using luminol-chemiluminescence-high
   performance liquid chromatography (CL-HPLC). From the equimolar reaction
   mixture of 1 M beta-alanine/D-glucose in phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) at 95
   degrees C, two hydroperoxides and H2O2 were detected as chemiluminescent
   products in CL-HPLC, and the yields were proportional to the browning
   development. One of these hydroperoxides was isolated and identified as
   3-hydroxy-5-hydroperoxy-2-methyl-5,6-dihydropyran-4-one (HMDP, pyrone
   hydroperoxide) by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. The HMDP
   formation was also confirmed in L-lysine/D-glucose and in bovine serum
   albumin/D-glucose with the physiological incubation at 37 degrees C for
   4 days and 3 wk, respectively. Incubation at 37 degrees C of human
   plasma containing 5.5-25.0 mM of D-glucose far 60 h showed the glucose
   concentration-dependent formation of HMDP (10-35 mu M of H2O2
   equivalence). The HMDP was negative to thiobarbituric acid reaction and
   was degraded by peroxidases such as horseradish peroxidase, Athromyces
   ramosus peroxidase, heated cytochrome c, and microperoxidase. The
   results strongly suggested the formation of such hydroperoxide even in
   biological Maillard reaction termed as glycation, and implied its

Abstract = {{DEVELOPMENT and maintenance of the mammalian nervous system is dependent
   upon neurotrophic cytokines. One class of neurotrophic factor acts
   through receptor complexes involving the low-affinity leukaemia
   inhibitory factor receptor subunit (LIF-R)(1-3). Members of this family
   of cytokines, such as ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and leukaemia
   inhibitory factor (LIF), have profound effects on the survival and
   maintenance of motor neurons(4-10). Recently it was reported that mice
   lacking LIF-R die shortly after birth(11) unlike mice lacking CNTF or
   LIF which are viable. Here we describe histopathological analyses of
   lifr mutants that reveal a loss >35\% of facial motor neurons, 40\% of
   spinal motor neurons and 50\% of neurons in the nucleus ambiguus. These
   findings point to the existence of a ligand for LIF-R that is required

   distortions. Soft distortions, which result in differencies between the

   the nuclear density variation, independent of x in the range 0.001 less

Abstract = {{In any transverse section of the Dnieper-Donets basin the rift, filled
   with pre-rift and syn-rift Devonian sequences, overlain with post-rift
   Carboniferous, Permian, Mesozoic, and Palaeogene fill, is explicitly
   expressed. Within the rift boundaries the crystalline basement is
   overlain with Devonian sediments, while the shoulders are overlain by
   Carboniferous strata. The structure of the rift is characterized by
   large-scale rotational fault blocks and half-grabens, carried by the
   basin-parallel to normal marginal faults or by major horst blocks. The
   rift is conjugated with its shoulders mainly along large-amplitude
   normal faults.
   The main stage of Devonian rifting occurred during the Frasnian and
   Famennian. Post-rift basin development is characterized by the formation
   of a vast syncline, set on the rift and its shoulders, commencing in
   Tournaisian time (362.5 Ma). Carboniferous and Mesozoic sediments cover
   the rift flanks and increase in thickness towards the rift axis. Maximum
   thicknesses of the successions occur in the southern part of the axial
   zone of the basin and in the Donbas. The cumulative thickness of the
   Carboniferous sediments reaches 11 km, with the maximum depth of their
   base at about 15 km. The maximum thicknesses of sediments, accumulated
   during the whole Late Palaeozoic and Mesozoic history of the DD basin,
   constitute 2-6 km to the northwest and 15-19 km to southeast and in the
   Donbas. The axis of the maximum post-rift subsidence practically did not
   change its spatial position.
   Major post-rift tectonic events took place between the Devonian and
   Carboniferous, at the end of the Early Visean, in the middle of the
   Serpukhovian, between Early and Middle Carboniferous, in Permian time,
   and between the Mesozoic and Cenozoic Tectonic reactivations during the
   entire Carboniferous, Early Permian and the end of Mesozoic time were
   most pronounced in the southeast part of the DD basin and in the Donbas,
   whereas they were least pronounced in the northwest part of the basin
   merging the Pripyat Trough where they are barely observed. The most
   active development of salt structures and stocks correspond with the
   periods of structural reactivation.}},

Abstract = {{NADH oxidase activity from HeLa plasma membranes was inhibited by the
   antitumor sulfonylurea
   N-(4-methylphenylsulfonyl)-N'-(4-chlorophenyl)urea (LY181984). With
   sealed right side-out vesicles, the drug inhibited half maximally at
   about 30 nM and the inhibition was nearly complete. A closely related
   but growth-inactive sulfonylurea,
   N-(4-methylphenylsulfonyl)-N'-(phenyl)ur (LY181985), did not inhibit the
   activity. With plasma membranes first solubilized with 2\% Triton X-100,
   activity also was inhibited by LY181984 and not by LY181985 but the
   maximum inhibition at 10 mu M LY181984 was only 50\%. When sealed right
   side-out plasma membrane vesicles were frozen and thawed repeatedly to
   even some of the vesicles into an inside-out configuration, the NADH
   oxidase activity again was only about 50\% inhibited by 1 mu M LY181984.
   In such preparations, the right side-out vesicles exhibited an
   electrophoretic mobility greater than that of the inside-out vesicles.
   Sidedness was confirmed by measurements of ATPase latency and binding of
   immunogold-labeled concanavalin A. When the two vesicle populations were
   resolved by preparative free-flow electrophoresis, the active antitumor
   sulfonylurea LY181984 inhibited only the NADH oxidase activity of the
   right side-out vesicles. These findings suggested two NADH sites or
   activity isoforms for the plasma membrane NADH oxidase. One activity,
   inhibited by LY181984, appeared to be accessible to external NADH only
   with sealed right side-out vesicles. The other, not inhibited by
   LY181984, was accessible to NADH only with inside-out vesicles or after
   membrane disruption by Triton X-100, The findings demonstrate that the
   NADH oxidation site inhibited as a result of binding the active
   antitumor sulfonylurea LY181984 is at the external cell surface. Plasma
   membrane vesicles from HeLa cells are able to oxidize NADH supplied to
   either membrane surface but only with inside-out vesicles is NADH
   oxidation sensitive to inhibition by the antitumor sulfonylurea.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a model containing clustered peptide chains to
   evaluate coupling difficulties associated with interchain interactions
   in solid phase peptide synthesis. Our results revealed two new findings.
   First, there was a significant difference in solvation properties
   between the conventional dispersed and our clustered peptide chain
   models at a similar level of peptidyl loading. At the completion of an
   eight-residue peptide, with a peptide content of >61\%, the solvated
   volumes of a dispersed chain model increased 20-30-fold over the initial
   dry resin and were about 4-5-fold higher than those of the clustered
   chain model in both polar and nonpolar solvents. The decrease in
   solvation mimics the effect of higher cross-linking of resin supports,
   leading to poor swelling ability. Second, there was a polystyrene to
   polyamide transition when the peptide loading reached approximately 50\%
   of the peptidyl resin. In this transition phase, the swelling and growth
   of the peptidyl resin reached the lowest point in both polar aprotic and
   hydrophobic solvents. Furthermore, the phase transition was also the
   crossover point where the aprotic polar solvent N,N-dimethylformamide
   provided better resin swellability than the nonpolar solvent
   dichloromethane. A good correlation between swelling ability and the
   coupling yield in aprotic polar solvents was also found. A combination
   of the aprotic polar solvent NMP and coupling at elevated temperature
   was found to be the most efficient to increase coupling efficiency.
   Thus, our results provide evidence for coupling difficulties associated
   with the interchain interactions exacerbated by chain clustering and
   phase transition.}},

Abstract = {{Photoionization of phenothiazine (PTH) and reactions of the solvated
   electron with some electron accepters were studied with steady state and
   time-resolved EPR and transient optical absorption techniques.
   Time-resolved EPR spectra from the phenothiazine cation radical (PTH
   .(+)) and hydrated electron (e(aq)(-)) formed in sodium 1-dodecylsulfate
   (SDS) micellar solution were observed in emission. By contrast, PTH .(+)
   formed by photoionization of PTH in alcohols gives absorptive EPR
   signals. The spin polarization carried by the hydrated electron in SDS
   solutions can be transferred effectively to a stable nitroxyl free
   radical 3-carboxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-1-pyrrolidinyloxyl (N .(-))
   present in the bulk aqueous phase. EPR and flash photolysis measurements
   show that this electron spin polarization transfer process proceeds with
   a rate which is approximately five times faster than the chemical
   reaction between e(aq)(-) and N .(-). The marked difference in rates is
   attributed to differences in spin-statistical factors and difference in
   reaction radii for spin exchange compared to reaction. In alcohol
   solutions of PTH and a nitroxyl stable radical
   (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpyperidin-1-oxyl, TEMPO), excitation of PTH also
   results in emissive polarization of the EPR spectrum of the stable
   radical. In this case the polarization is produced by the interaction
   between PTH triplets and TEMPO (doublet-triplet radical pair CIDEP).
   Trapping of e(aq)(-) produced by photoionization of PTH in SDS solution
   by electron accepters such as acrylamide and chlorophenols yields free
   radicals whose formation was monitored with time-resolved EPR and flash
   photolysis.}},

Abstract = {{The fluorescent dyes 5'-(iodoacetamido)tetramethylrhodamine (5'IATR) and
   5'-(iodoacetamido)fluorescein (5'IAF) bind covalently to the reactive
   sulfhydryl (SH1) of myosin subfragment 1 (S1), the 5'IATR as a dimer and
   the 5'IAF as a monomer. The conformation of the dimer and the
   dye-protein complex was investigated by comparison of several
   spectroscopic signals of the molecules before and after their
   association into a complex and interpretation of any changes using a
   coupled dipole oscillator model adapted for this problem {[}Burghardt \&
   Ajtai (1995) Biophys. Chern. (submitted for publication)]. Absorption
   and fluorescence spectroscopies were performed on 5'IAF, 5'IATR, and
   rhodamine 6G (R6G) and rhodamine B (RB) as models of dimer conformation.
   Absorption, fluorescence, and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies
   were performed on 5'IATR-modified S1 (5'R-S1) and 5'IAF-modified S1
   (5'F-S1). Combined spectroscopic and 2-D NMR data from rhodamines in
   solution determined the conformations of the dimers. Xanthene rings from
   dimers of identical dyes (homodimers) stacked in two structures having
   very different spectroscopic signatures. Xanthene rings from the
   heterodimer of R6G and RB stacked in one conformation. The two homodimer
   conformations of 5'IATR are equally likely to form in solution. The
   other rhodamine homodimers have one dominant, but not exclusive,
   structure. Both conformations of the 5'IATR dimer were coupled to a
   tryptophan as a model of the dye-protein interaction at SH1. The
   calculated CD from one dimer conformer (dimer A) coupled to tryptophan
   is negative for the lowest energy CD absorption band. The other dimer
   (dimer B) gives positive CD on the two lowest energy CD absorption
   bands. Both dimer structures of 5'IATR contributed to the early
   time-dependent CD signal from 5'IATR binding to SH1, but at equilibrium
   the CD signal indicated only dimer B, suggesting that the SH1 binding
   pocket converts dimer A into dimer B. The time-dependent CD signal from
   5'IAF changes amplitude but not shape during the reaction with SH1. The
   model calculation accounting for the spectroscopic signals of 5'R-S1 and
   5'F-S1 indicates several likely conformations of the 5'IATR
   dimer-tryptophan and 5'IAF-tryptophan complexes embedded in S1. These
   structures fit to the a-carbon structure of the SH1 binding pocket when
   the 5'IATR dimer and 5'IAF interact closely with Trp510 {[}Rayment et
   al. (1993) Science 261, 50-58]. The additional constraints imposed by
   the known orientation of the rhodamine dimer relative to the principal
   hydrodynamic frame of S1 reject all but one of the 5'IATR
   dimer-tryptophan and 5'IAF-tryptophan structures coordinated with
   Trp510.}},

   values of approximately 6.8 x 10(-5) and 16 x 10(-5) s(-1) for GB
   (sarin) and VX, respectively, in 0.1 M Bis-Tris, 25 degrees C. The free
   energy of activation for k(3) was 19 kcal mol(-1), and measurement of pH
   dependence suggested that reactivation resulted from an acidic group
   with pK(a) 6.2. To evaluate further the importance of His in achieving
   this result, we changed the same Gly to Lys (G117K) and compared its
   substrate and inhibitor kinetics with those of G117H. Both mutants
   retained esterase activity with K-m values similar to those of WT for
   neutral ester hydrolysis, but G117K did not reactivate. Complete
   reactivation proves that G117H is not irreversibly inhibited but instead
   functions as a catalyst for OP hydrolysis. Dephosphonylation is the
   rate-limiting step, and G117H effects overall rate constant enhancements
   of approximately 100- and 2000-fold above the uncatalyzed hydrolysis of
   GB and VX, respectively, at pH 6.0, 25.0 degrees C. We conclude that an
   appropriately positioned imidazolium ion in the oxyanion hole catalyzes
   dephosphonylation and, thereby, confers a novel organophosphonus acid
   anhydride hydrolase activity upon butyrylcholinesterase.}},

Abstract = {{The RCK/P54 gene was previously isolated from the chromosome
   translocation breakpoint region on 11q23 of a human lymphoma cell line,
   RC-K8, with t(11;14)(q23;q32). It was found to encode a
   472-483-amino-acid (aa) polypeptide belonging to an RNA
   helicase/translation initiation factor family. The aim of the present
   investigation was the isolation and comparative sequence analysis of the
   mouse RCK/P54 cDNA from a BALB/c spleen cDNA library, Sequence analysis
   revealed an open reading frame (ORF) predicting a polypeptide of 483 aa
   showing 97.7\% identity to human RCK/p54, Northern analysis demonstrated
   a 7.5-kb signal in all tissues tested and in vitro translation analysis
   showed a 54-kDa polypeptide, These results indicate that both mouse and
   human RCK/P54 are highly conserved.}},

Abstract = {{Troponin C (TnC) is an 18 kDa (162-residue) thin-filament
   calcium-binding protein responsible for triggering muscle contraction
   upon the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The
   structure of TnC with two calcium ions bound has previously been solved
   by X-ray methods. Shown here is the solution structure of TnC which has
   been solved using 3D and 4D heteronuclear nuclear magnetic resonance
   (NMR) spectroscopic techniques. The H-1, C-13, and N-15 backbone
   chemical shifts have already been published {[}Slupsky, C. M., Reinach,
   F. C., Smillie, L. B., \& Sykes, B. D. (1995) Protein Sci. 4,
   1279-1290]. Presented herein are the H-1, C-13, and N-15 side-chain
   chemical shifts which are 80\% complete. The structure of
   calcium-saturated TnC was determined on the basis of 2106 NOE-derived
   distance restraints, 121 phi dihedral angle restraints, and 76 psi
   dihedral angle restraints. The appearance of calcium-saturated TnC
   reveals a dumbbell-shaped molecule with two globular domains connected
   by a linker. The structures of the N-terminal and C-terminal domains are
   highly converged {[}backbone atomic root mean square deviations (rmsd)
   about the mean atomic coordinate position for residues 10-80 and 98-155
   are 0.66 +/- 0.17 and 0.69 +/- 0.18 Angstrom, respectively]; however,
   the orientation of one domain with respect to the other is not
   well-defined, and thus each domain appears to be structurally
   independent. Comparison of the calcium-saturated form of TnC determined
   herein with the half-saturated form determined by X-ray methods reveals
   two major differences. First, there is a major structural change which
   occurs in the N-terminal domain resulting in the opening of a
   hydrophobic pocket presumably to present itself to its target protein
   troponin I. This structural change appears to involve only helices B and
   C which move away from helices N/A/D by the alteration of the backbone
   phi, psi angles of glutamic acid 41 from irregular in the crystal
   structure (-97 degrees, -7 degrees) to helical in the NMR
   calcium-saturated structure (-60 degrees, -34 degrees). The other
   difference between the two structures is the presence of a flexible
   linker between the two domains in the NMR structure. This flexible
   linker allows the two domains of TnC to adopt any orientation with
   respect to one another such that they can interact with a variety of
   targets.}},

Title = {{Identification of a common cytochrome P450 epitope near the conserved

Journal = {{BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{The cytochrome P450 (P450) proteins constitute a superfamily of enzymes
   involved in various oxidations and related activities. Polyclonal
   antibodies raised against bacterial recombinant human P450s varied in
   specificity, depending upon the individual rabbits used. Several of the
   antisera raised against P450s 2C10 and 2E1 recognized a number of P450
   family 1, 2, and 3 proteins, and two of the less selective antibodies
   were used to identify cross-reactive epitopes. P450 2C10 peptides
   reacting with anti-P450 2E1 and P450 2E1 peptides reacting with
   anti-P450 2C10 were isolated after electrophoresis/immunoblotting and
   analyzed by Edman degradation. Several of these were in a region near
   the highly conserved Cys that is a putative axial ligand to the heme.
   Peptides corresponding to the most conserved regions in this area were
   synthesized. Anti-P450 2C10 sera did not recognize 14-mer peptides
   corresponding to the heme-binding region (2C10 410-423 or 2E1 409-422)
   or the 14-mer peptides immediately C-terminal to these (2C10 425-438 or
   2E1 424-437), but anti-P450 2E1 sera showed weak reaction with the
   latter two synthetic peptides. A longer peptide (29-mer) of P450 2E1
   containing parts of both regions (412-440) reacted with both anti-P450
   2C10 and anti-P450 2E1 antisera. Antibodies raised against a conjugate
   of the 29-mer peptide (with hemocyanin) recognized this antigen, the
   more C-terminal 14-mer peptides (2C10 425-438 and 2E1 424-437), P450s
   2C10 and 2E1, and P450s 1A1, 11A1, and 17A. The 29-mer peptide showed
   considerable a-helix structure as judged by CD spectroscopy, in contrast
   to any of the 14-mers. The cross-reactivity seen in immunoblotting was
   not observed in inhibition of catalytic activity. We conclude that the
   region immediately beyond the conserved Cys region is a common epitope
   for P450 2C10 and P450 2E1 and is a common epitope for the
   immunochemical cross-reactivity seen with some other P450 proteins. The
   region appears to correspond to the L-helix of bacterial P450s on the
   basis of sequence alignments and is probably exposed to the surface of
   the proteins.}},

   tracking detectors especially in the high rate, high radiation
   environments of future colliders such as the LHC. In order to survive in
   this environment, detectors must be radiation hard. We have constructed
   charged particle detectors using high quality CVD diamond and performed
   radiation hardness tests on them. The signal response of diamond
   detectors to ionizing particles is measured before and after
   irradiation. Diamond detectors have been exposed to Co-60 photons at
   Argonne National Laboratory, 300 MeV/c pions at PSI, 500 MeV protons at
   TRIUMF and 5 MeV alpha particles at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The
   results show that CVD diamond is an extremely radiation hard material
   well suited for particle detector production.}},

Abstract = {{We present the performance of the Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) built
   for the NA50 experiment at the CERN SPS. This detector measures the
   Cherenkov light produced in silica optical fibres embedded in tantalum
   and offers the double advantage of being highly radiation resistant (up
   to several Grad) and very fast (signal width of the order of 10 ns). It
   has an active volume of 5 x 5 x 65 cm(3) with a fibre to tantalum volume
   ratio of 1/17; the fibres are positioned at an angle of 0 degrees with
   respect to the beam direction and have a diameter of 365 mu m. The
   measured energy resolution (sigma/E) is 30\% for protons at 205 GeV and
   5\% for lead ions at 160 GeV/nucleon.
   The detector exhibits also very good localising properties since it can
   detect the impact point of the lead beam on its front face with a
   precision better than 0.4 mm Mms.}},

Abstract = {{Lamin B2 modification in synchronously dividing populations of human
   diploid fibroblasts was determined by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis
   and {[}P-32]orthophosphate labelling. In quiescent (G(0)) and G(1)
   cultures of HDF, lamin B-2 migrated as 2 spots on 2-dimensional gels, In
   contrast, in S-phase populations of HDF lamin B-2 migrated as a single
   basic species, The level of lamin B-2 phosphorylation was determined
   after immunoisolation from {[}P-32]orthophosphate labelled cells, The
   results of these experiments indicated a 2-3-fold increase in the steady
   state level of lamin B-2 phosphorylation in S-phase HDF compared with
   G(0) HDF. Consistent with this evidence, tryptic peptide maps revealed
   the presence of a phosphopeptide in S-phase lamin B, which was absent
   from G(0) lamin B-2, Since all of the phosphate incorporated into
   S-phase and G(0) lamin B-2 was recovered in serine residues we conclude
   that the S-phase specific phosphopeptide did not represent either of the
   cdc2 sites associated with entry nuclear lamina breakdown.}},

Abstract = {{Ion probe techniques for measuring in situ O-18/O-16 ratios from
   insulating materials (particularly quartz) have been developed using an
   Isolab 54 ion microprobe. O-18/O-16 ratio measurements were obtained
   from a range of quartz standards for which O-18/O-16(SMOW) ratios had
   been determined by conventional fluorination techniques. The correlation
   between the ratios obtained by ion probe and by conventional
   fluorination methods is high. Accurate absolute O-18/O-16(SMOW) ratios
   can be obtained by normalisation to a well-characterised standard and
   the Is deviation between the ion probe ratio and the conventionally
   determined ratio is 1.5 parts per thousand for a single measurement on
   the standard and a single measurement on the unknown sample. This
   measured scatter in normalised ratios is consistent with the typical
   measured uncertainty on a spot measurement being of the order of 1 parts
   per thousand and the uncertainty in the absolute ratio being derived
   from uncertainties added in quadrature. The data show no large
   systematic errors, demonstrating that the trueness of the mean of a
   number of ion probe determined ratios may be improved by repeated
   measurements.
   Detector stability and instrumental fractionation yield measured ratios
   (absolute in the sense that they are not normalised from day to day)
   which show a scatter of between 1 and 2 parts per thousand over periods
   of many weeks, an instrument stability which is an order of magnitude
   better than data published elsewhere. This level of stability opens the
   possibility of `'standardless'' ion probe oxygen isotope ratio
   measurements, certainly to an accuracy of 2 parts per thousand or
   better.}},

Abstract = {{The origin of present day introns is a subject of spirited debate. Any
   intron evolution theory must account for not only nuclear spliceosomal
   introns but also their antecedents. The evolution of group II introns is
   fundamental to this debate, since group II introns are the proposed
   progenitors of nuclear spliceosomal introns and are found in ancient
   genes from modern organisms. We have studied the evolution of
   chloroplast introns and twintrons (introns within introns) in the genus
   Euglena. Our hypothesis is that Euglena chloroplast introns arose late
   in the evolution of this lineage and that twintrons were formed by the
   insertion of one or more introns into existing introns. In the present
   study we find that 22 out of 26 introns surveyed in six different
   photosynthesis-related genes from the plastid DNA of Euglena gracilis
   are not present in one or more basally branching Euglena spp. These
   results are supportive of a late origin for Euglena chloroplast group II
   introns. The psbT gene in Euglena viridis, a basally branching Euglena
   species, contains a single intron in the identical position to a psbT
   twintron from E.gracilis, a derived species. The E.viridis intron, when
   compared with 99 other Euglena group II introns, is most similar to the
   external intron of the E.gracilis psbT twintron. Based on these data,
   the addition of introns to the ancestral psbT intron in the common
   ancester of E.viridis and E.gracilis gave rise to the psbT twintron in
   E.gracilis.}},

Abstract = {{We present spectra with resolving power lambda/Delta lambda similar or
   equal to 1200 of the 4.67 mu m (2140 cm(-1)) feature of solid carbon
   monoxide in four held stars and two embedded stars in the line of sight
   to the Taurus dark cloud. Our data are consistent with the presence of
   CO in distinct polar and nonpolar ice mixtures. The profiles are fitted
   with models that use laboratory data for various astrophysical ice
   analogs. We find that the broad (polar) component of the profile in all
   sources is generally consistent with CO as a minor constituent in an ice
   matrix dominated by H2O at 10 K. The narrow (nonpolar) component
   observed in the field stars is best fitted by a dilute H2O matrix with
   CO itself as the dominant constituent. Significantly, the embedded stars
   Elias 18 and (more tentatively) Elias 1 have distinctly different narrow
   components which are best fitted by CO in a mixture dominated by CO2.
   Our results may therefore suggest that CO2 is being formed by energetic
   processing of grain mantles in the dark cloud close to the embedded
   stars.
   Column densities are deduced for solid CO in each line of sight. The
   overall solid state abundance of CO is similar to 30\% of that of H2O in
   the most highly obscured field stars. Comparison of column density
   estimates for solid and gas phases indicates that up to similar to 40\%
   of the CO is depleted from gas onto grains in quiescent regions of the
   cloud. We conclude that this is indicative of the functioning of an
   efficient desorption process throughout the cloud.
   The correlations of CO and H2O column densities with visual extinction
   are examined. Considering only field stars in Taurus, we deduce the
   following correlations: N(CO) = (0.4 +/- 0.1){[}A(V) - (6.0 +/- 4.1)] x
   10(17) cm(-2) and N(H2O) = (1.5 +/- 0.1){[}A(V) - (3.2 +/- 0.5)] x
   10(17) cm(-2). Comparing these results with data from the literature for
   other clouds, we find some uniformity in behavior: our correlation lines
   for Taurus are reasonably representative of data for sources in the
   Serpens and R CrA clouds, to within observational scatter. Sources in
   the rho Oph dark cloud show a greater degree of scatter about these
   correlation lines and exhibit a trend of lower molecular column
   densities per unit extinction toward individual embedded sources.}},

Abstract = {{We study the effect of the dynamical friction induced by the presence of
   substructure on the statistics of the collapse of density peaks.
   Applying the results of a recent paper by Antonuccio-Delogu \&
   Colafrancesco (1994), we show that within high-density environments,
   such as rich clusters of galaxies, the collapse of the low-v peaks is
   strongly delayed until very late epochs. A bias of dynamical nature thus
   naturally arises because high-density peaks preferentially collapse to
   form halos within which visible objects eventually will condense. We
   then derive a selection function for these collapsing structures. Using
   this physical selection mechanism, we can calculate the values of the
   bias coefficient on cluster scales for any hierarchical clustering
   scenario. For a standard cold dark matter model, we show here that the
   dynamical bias that we derive can account for a substantial part of the
   total bias required by observations on cluster scales.}},

Abstract = {{Stellar wind bubble dynamics are sensitive to the stellar wind velocity
   and mass-loss history. Observations of ring nebulae can thus strongly
   constrain theories of stellar winds and massive stellar evolution.
   Furthermore, ring nebulae are often observed around Wolf-Rayet stars
   likely to soon become supernovae, so their influence on the
   circumstellar medium is vital to understanding young supernova remnants
   such as Cas A. To interpret the observations, the connection between the
   input wind and the observed gas distribution must be described. This is
   our goal in this series of papers.
   In this paper, we present analytic solutions for the dynamics of bubbles
   expanding into media with power-law density distributions such as r(-2).
   We apply the solutions to Wolf-Rayet bubbles expanding into red
   supergiant winds. A semianalytic method is used to model aspherical
   bubbles resulting from nonspherical red supergiant winds. Applying this
   method, we find, for the case of steady winds, that bubbles expand at
   nearly constant velocity in each direction, keeping their shapes. We can
   then make the approximation that the bubbles have constant-eccentricity
   ellipsoidal shapes to derive a fully analytic dynamical model. From this
   we derive solutions for the diffuse X-ray luminosities from steady
   winds, using the assumption of classical conductive evaporation. Useful
   relationships between observables are also given.
   The solutions are compared to observations of the Wolf-Rayet ring nebula
   NGC 6888. We find that with either the assumption of energy conservation
   or momentum conservation, the dynamics of this nebula cannot be
   explained if the reported wind kinetic energy of the central star WR 136
   is used. The nebular kinematics require an order of magnitude less
   effective mechanical luminosity from WR 136, demanding a lower mass-loss
   rate, a lower wind velocity, or both.}},

   mapped to distal chromosome 5p, using physical methods. Our goal was to
   place SLC6A3 in the genetic linkage map and to test for linkage to
   Tourette syndrome. Genetic linkage methods were used to place SLC6A3 in
   the genetic linkage map. Four extended pedigrees (one of which overlaps

   between TS and SLC6A3 could be excluded independently in two branches of
   a large kindred segregating TS; the lod score in a third family was also
   negative, but not significant: Cumulative results show a lod score of
   -6.2 at theta = 0 and of -3.9 at theta = 0.05 (dominant model, narrow
   disease definition). SLC6A3 thus maps to distal chromosome 5p by linkage
   analysis, in agreement with previous physical mapping data. A mutation
   at SLC6A3 is not causative for TS in the two large families that
   generated significant negative lod scores (if the parameters of our
   analyses were correct) and is unlikely to be causative in the family
   that generated a negative lod score that did not reach significance.
   These results do not exclude a role for the dopamine transporter in
   influencing risk for TS in combination with other loci. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{At the Earth's surface, continents and oceans impose different thermal
   boundary conditions at the top of the mantle. Laboratory experiments are
   used to investigate the consequences of this for mantle convection. The
   upper boundary of the experimental tank was made of copper plates
   enforcing a fixed temperature and had a conductive lid of finite width
   in the middle. Beneath this lid, the thermal boundary condition was of
   the `'mixed'' type, with a Blot number depending on the dimensions and
   thermal conductivity of the lid. Experimental values of the Blot number
   were scaled to Earth values. Experiments were run for a large range of
   Rayleigh numbers, from 10(4) to 10(7), and for several lid widths. The
   effects of temperature-dependent viscosity and of the shape of the lid
   were investigated. At steady state, in all cases, there is an upwelling
   beneath the conductive lid, which feeds two symmetrical and elongated
   convective cells. Three different dynamic regimes were identified as a
   function of Rayleigh number, independently of the lid width. At Rayleigh
   numbers lower than 1.2 10(5), the upwelling is steady both in geometry
   and temperature structure. At Rayleigh numbers between 1.2 10(5) and 2
   10(6), this central upwelling is intermittent. At larger values of the
   Rayleigh number, there is no longer a simple upwelling structure, but a
   set of small plumes rising together and distorted by a cellular
   circulation of large horizontal extent. Thus the conductive lid always
   imposes a large-scale flow pattern. The length of these convective cells
   is a function of lid width. It is equal to the lid width at large values
   and decrease to the Rayleigh-Benard value as the lid width decreases to
   zero. A fluid loop model explains the most important features of this
   form of convection. The cell length is such that the upwelling
   temperature is minimized for a given Rayleigh number and lid width and
   is an increasing function of lid width and a decreasing function of
   Rayleigh number. Transient experiments demonstrate that the large-scale
   flow structure develops rapidly with even small horizontal temperature
   differences. Implications for the Earth are that large-scale convection
   cells exist in conditions which, in the absence of continents, would
   probably lead to a chaotic convection pattern dominated by plumes. At
   high Rayleigh number, continental breakup is effected by a large-scale
   line upwelling structure which includes a number of individual plumes.}},

Abstract = {{Based on density functional theory calculations of H-2 dissociation on
   Al(111), Cu(111), Pt(111) and Cu3Pt(111) we present a consistent picture
   of some key physical properties determining the reactivity of metal and
   alloy surfaces. The four metal surfaces are chosen to represent metals
   with no d-bands, with filled d-bands and with d-states at the Fermi
   level. We show that electronic states in the entire valence band of the
   metal surface are responsible for the reactivity, which consequently
   cannot be understood solely in terms of the density of states at the
   Fermi level nor in terms of the empty d-states above it. Rather we
   suggest that trends in reactivities can be understood in terms of the
   hybridization energy between the bonding and anti-bonding adsorbate
   states and the metal d-bands (when present), and we demonstrate that a
   simple frozen potential based estimate of the hybridization energy
   correlates well with the calculated variation of the barrier height for

Volume = {{304}},

Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{When more than one wave is present in a system there exists the
   possibilty of a resonant interaction. Resonant modes become nonlinear at
   smaller amplitudes than nonresonant modes. If the nonlinearity causes
   increased growth rates then it may be that, for a time at least, the
   behaviour of the resonant modes will be the dominant feature. In shear
   layers resonant triads can be found where two oblique modes resonate
   with a plane wave and this case has received much attention in the
   literature. For a given plane wave, the resonance condition selects
   oblique modes of a certain wave angle and agreement has been found
   between predicted wave angles and those measured in experiments.
   In this paper it is shown that resonance conditions can also be met
   between two planar waves in a Blasius boundary layer, where one of the
   waves is the usual unstable mode, and the other is a higher-order damped
   mode. The effects of wave modulation are modelled by performing a
   spatial analysis but allowing the frequency to become complex. It is
   found that for certain complex frequencies the strength of the nonlinear
   resonant interaction coefficients is greatly increased. Experiments have
   been performed in a low-turbulence wind tunnel in which disturbances
   with modulated and unmodulated sections were introduced into the
   boundary layer over a flat plate. It was found that disturbances with
   the frequency and modulation predicted by the theory do indeed show a
   much greater susceptibility to nonlinear breakdown than nonresonant
   disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{In the solar corona shock waves are generated by flares and/or coronal
   mass ejections. They manifest themselves in solar type II radio bursts
   appearing as emission stripes with a slow drift from high to low

   indicates that electrons are accelerated to suprathermal and/or
   relativistic velocities at these shocks. As well known by
   extraterrestrial in-situ measurements supercritical, quasi-parallel,
   collisionless shocks are accompanied by so-called SLAMS (short large
   amplitude magnetic field structures). These SLAMS can act as strong
   magnetic mirrors, at which charged particles can be reflected and
   accelerated. Thus, thermal electrons gain energy due to multiple
   reflections between two SLAMS and reach suprathermal and relativistic
   velocities. This mechanism of accelerating electrons is discussed for
   the solar corona and may be responsible for the so-called
   `'herringbones'' observed in solar type II radio bursts.}},

Abstract = {{An algorithm is presented which uses the surface waveforms originating
   from one event recorded in two stations which are located close to each
   other. The waveforms are inverted for local laterally homogeneous S
   velocity structure or for path-averaged horizontal S velocity gradients.
   In the first case the stations are situated on the same great circle to
   the source. In the second case the two stations lie at approximately the
   same epicentral distance, but with a slightly different azimuth. In both
   cases, the frequency-dependent phase differences between the two
   recordings are used as data for an inversion for S velocity values. No a
   priori knowledge about the source parameters and the medium between the
   source and the nearest receiver is needed, These factors are estimated
   in the first step of the inversion (linear). In the second step of the
   inversion (nonlinear) the S velocity information is obtained. Synthetic
   tests show that the algorithm is a powerful tool to image structure with
   only two fundamental mode surface wave recordings as data. In addition,
   they show that for the case where a horizontal gradient is determined,
   higher modes can be included in the analysis to display gradients at
   larger depths, without the need to identify the individual modes
   separately. The power of the method is illustrated with some real data
   examples that are all related to a pronounced tectonic boundary in
   western Eurasia: the Tornquist-Teisseyre zone. The results of the
   experiments with real data coincide well with previously obtained models
   for this area.}},

Abstract = {{Restenosis is the main limitation of percutaneous transluminal coronary
   angioplasty (PTCA). It occurs exclusively within the first 6 months
   after successful PTCA and leads in 25 to 30\% of the cases to repeat
   revascularization. Its pathophysiology appears to involve mainly intimal
   hyperplasia at the injury site and constrictive remodeling of the whole
   artery; the relative roles of each remain debated, Detection of
   restenosis is often simple, when typical angina reccurs after a
   symptom-free interval, but is often enhanced by a stress test, sometimes
   coupled to a thallium scintigraphy. The value of these tests is enhanced
   when a pre-PTCA test is available for comparison. The only preventive
   treatment with proven efficacy is the placement of stents, which however
   do not provide full protection against the development of restenosis,
   which suggests that ideal prevention should combine a mechanical
   approach, targeted against vessel remodeling and a biological approach
   targeted against intimal hyperplasia.}},

Abstract = {{We have shown previously that the active form of avian sarcoma virus
   integrase (ASV IN) is a multimer. In this report we investigate IN
   multimerization properties by a variety of methods that include size
   exclusion chromatography, chemical cross-linking, and protein overlay
   assays. We show that removal of the nonconserved C-terminal region of IN
   results in a reduced capacity for multimerization, whereas deletion of
   the first 38 amino acids has little effect on the oligomeric state.
   Binding of a full-length IN fusion protein to various IN fragments
   indicates that sequences in both the catalytic core (residues 50-207)
   and a C-terminal region (residues 201-240) contribute to IN
   self-association. We also observe that the isolated C-terminal fragment
   (residues 201-286) is capable of self-association. Finally, a single
   amino acid substitution in the core domain (S85G) produces a severe
   defect in multimerization. We conclude from these analyses that both the
   catalytic core and a region in the nonconserved C terminus are involved
   in ASV integrase multimerization. These results enhance our
   understanding of integrase self-association determinants and define a
   major role of the C-terminal region of Am integrase in this process.}},

Abstract = {{Axial deflection of DNA molecules in solution results from thermal
   motion and intrinsic curvature related to the DNA sequence. In order to
   measure directly the contribution of thermal motion we constructed
   intrinsically straight DNA molecules and measured their persistence
   length by cryo-electron microscopy The persistence length of such
   intrinsically straight DNA molecules suspended in thin layers of
   cryo-vitrified solutions is about 80 nm. In order to test our
   experimental approach, we measured the apparent persistence length of
   DNA molecules with natural `'random'' sequences. The result of about 45
   nm is consistent with the generally accepted value of the apparent
   persistence length of natural DNA sequences. By comparing the apparent
   persistence length to intrinsically straight DNA with that of natural
   DNA, it is possible to determine both the dynamic and the static
   contributions to the apparent persistence length. (C) 1995 Academic

   the topological sum of I copies of the convergent sequence with all

   nature of this space is what lies behind its occurrences in many
   seemingly unrelated topological problems. For example, consider the
   problem which ask us to compute the tightness of the square of S(I). We
   shall show that this is in fact equivalent to the well-known and more
   crucial topological question of W. Fleissner which asks whether, in the
   class of first countable spaces, the property of being collectionwise
   Hausdorff at certain levels implies the same property at higher levels.
   Next, we consider Kodama's question whether or not every Sigma-product
   of Lasnev spaces is normal, The sequential fan again enters the scene as
   we show S((omega 2)) X S((omega 2)) X (omega 1), which can be embedded
   in a Sigma-product of Lasnev spaces as a closed set, can be nonnormal in
   some model of set theory. On the other hand, we show that the
   Sigma-product of arbitrarily many copies of the slightly smaller fan
   S((omega 1)) is normal.}},

Abstract = {{Helicobacter pylori urease belongs to a family of highly conserved
   urea-hydrolyzing enzymes. A common feature of these enzymes is the
   presence of two Lewis acid nickel ions and a reactive cysteine residue
   in the active site. The H+/K+-ATPase inhibitor omeprazole is a prodrug
   of a sulfenamide which covalently modifies cysteine residues on the
   luminal side of the H+/K+-ATPase of gastric parietal cells., Omeprazole
   and eight analogues were selected based on their chemical, electronic,
   and kinetic properties, and each was incubated with viable H. pylori in
   phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.4 for 30 min, after which 100 mM urea
   was added and the amount of ammonia formed analyzed after a further 10
   min. Inhibition between 0\% and 100\% at a 0.1 mM concentration was
   observed for the different analogues and could be expressed as a
   function of the pK(a)-value of the pyridine, the pK(a)-value of the
   benzimidazole, the overall lipophilicity, and, most importantly, the
   rate of sulfenamide formation, in a quantitative structure-activity
   relationship. The inhibition was potentiated by a lower pH (favoring the
   formation of the sulfenamide) but abolished in the presence of
   beta-mercaptoethanol (a scavenger of the sulfenamide). Structural
   analogues incapable of yielding the sulfenamide did not inhibit ammonia
   production. Treatment of Helicobacter felis-infected mice with 230 mu
   mol/kg flufofamide b.i.d. for 4 weeks, known to potently inhibit urease
   activity in vivo, as a means of eradicating the infection, was tested
   and compared with the effect of 125 mu mol/kg omeprazole b.i.d. for 4
   weeks. Neither treatment proved efficacious.}},

Abstract = {{Crystallographic analysis and site-directed mutagenesis have been used
   to identify the catalytic and oligosaccharide recognition residues of
   peptide-N-4-(N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase F (PNGase
   F), an amidohydrolase that removes intact asparagine-linked
   oligosaccharide chains from glycoproteins and glycopeptides. Mutagenesis
   has shown that three acidic residues, Asp-60, Glu-206, and Glu-118, that
   are located in a cleft at the interface between the two domains of the
   protein are essential for activity. The D60N mutant has no detectable
   activity, while E206Q and E118Q have less than 0.01 and 0.1\% of the
   wild-type activity, respectively. Crystallographic analysis, at
   2.0-Angstrom resolution, of the complex of the wild-type enzyme with the
   product, N,N'-diacetylchitobiose, shows that Asp-60 is in direct contact
   with the substrate at the cleavage site, while Glu-206 makes contact
   through a bridging water molecule. This indicates that Asp-60 is the
   primary catalytic residue, while Glu-206 probably is important for
   stabilization of reaction intermediates. Glu-118 forms a hydrogen bond
   with O-6 of the second N-acetylglucosamine residue of the substrate and
   the low activity of the E118Q mutant results from its reduced ability to
   bind the oligosaccharide. This analysis also suggests that the mechanism
   of action of PNGase F differs from those of L-asparaginase and
   glycosylasparaginase, which involve a threonine residue as the
   nucleophile.}},

Abstract = {{In switched-angle spinning spectroscopy (SAS) a sample is spun about
   different angles, beta, relative to the magnetic field, during various
   periods of the experiment. In the present work, SAS is combined with
   two-dimensional exchange spectroscopy in order to correlate carbon-13
   chemical shift tensors of the carbonyl (1) and hydroxyl (2) carbons of
   tropolone. Experiments were performed on a sample enriched to 25 at. \%
   in each of these sites (at different molecules). At this level of
   enrichment the dominant exchange mechanism between the two sites
   involves spin diffusion, The experiment consists of a preparation period
   during which the sample spins at the magic angle and the magnetization
   of one of the sites is quenched by means of a selective pulse sequence.
   During the rest of the experiment the sample spins with its axis away
   from the magic angle except for a short period just before the detection
   where the axis is switched to the magic angle in order to select the
   magnetization to be detected. Experiments were performed for all four
   possible combinations of the initial and final magnetizations, thus
   providing chemical shift correlations between carbons 1,1',2, and 2' in
   the two magnetically inequivalent (but symmetry related) molecules in
   the unit cell. Combining these results with the known crystal structure
   of tropolone (neglecting a small tilt between the perpendicular to the
   molecular plane and the crystallographic c-axis) provides information on
   the orientation and magnitude of the chemical shift tensors of the two
   types of carbons, The principal values (in ppm) are sigma(xx)(1)=65,
   sigma(yy)(1)=33, sigma(zz)(1)=-98, sigma(xx)(2)=77, sigma(yy)(2)=17, and
   sigma(zz)(2)=-94. Assuming sigma(zz) to be perpendicular to the
   molecular plane, the orientations of the sigma(yy) s' are 12 degrees off
   the C-1=0 bond (toward the hydroxyl carbon) for carbon 1 and 10 degrees
   off the C-3=C-2 bond (away from the carbonyl carbon) for carbon 2. (C)

Abstract = {{omega-Grammotoxin SIA (omega-GsTx SIA), a peptide isolated from

   whole-cell patch-clamp was used to record glutamatergic excitatory
   post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) evoked by extracellular stimulation of
   presynaptic neurons in primary rat hippocampal cultures. EPSCs displayed
   rapid kinetics and were blocked by CNQX. omega-Conotoxin (1 mu M) GVIA
   inhibited EPSCs by 46\%, while 30 nM and 1 mu M omega-agatoxin IVA
   produced 12\% and 69\% inhibition, respectively, consistent with
   coupling of N-, P- and Q-type Ca2+ channels to glutamatergic synaptic
   transmission. omega-GsTx SIA (1 mu M) rapidly, completely, and

   evoked by bath application of kainate. Thus, omega-GsTx SIA blocks
   glutamatergic synaptic transmission by blocking presynaptic
   voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, omega-GsTx SIA is the only agent that

Abstract = {{The retinoids are reported to chemoprevent second aerodigestive tract
   cancers in patients with prior lung or head and neck cancers, Since
   those retinoids already examined in clinical trials do not induce major
   clinical responses in lung cancers, it is hypothesized that the
   beneficial chemoprevention activity in lung neoplasias occurs within
   `fields' of carcinogen-transformed epithelial cells, To begin to
   investigate this retinoid action during lung carcinogenesis, the BZR-T33
   ras transformed human bronchial epithelial cell line that grows in an
   anchorage independent manner was examined, This study reports, as
   compared to controls, that all-trans-retinoic acid (RA)-treatment
   suppresses BZR-T33 proliferation in monolayer cultures and in anchorage
   independent and cloning efficiency growth assays, RA induces RAR-gamma 2
   > RAR gamma 1 in BZR-T33 cells but expression at the total cellular RNA
   level of RAR alpha and RXR alpha is not augmented by RA-treatment, RAR
   beta mRNA expression is repressed before and after RA-treatment and is
   only detected using a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
   (RT-PCR) assay, To determine directly which of these expressed retinoid
   receptors signals growth suppression, each receptor was individually
   transfected into BZR-T33 cells using episomal expression vectors, Growth
   inhibitory effects of these transfectants were compared to a control;
   episomal vector in colony efficiency assays, RAR gamma over-expression
   in the presence or absence of RA-treatment did not suppress BZR-T33
   growth more than controls, In contrast, over-expression of the other
   examined retinoid receptors inhibited BZR-T33 cellular cloning
   efficiency prior to RA-treatment and in this decreasing order after
   RA-treatment: RAR alpha > RAR beta > RXR alpha, The findings reported
   here reveal that RA suppresses proliferation and cloning efficiency in
   this transformed human bronchial epithelial cell through specific
   retinoid receptors, Further work is needed to evaluate the role of RA or
   its nuclear receptors in inhibiting even earlier steps in lung
   carcinogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{Sub-monolayer V2O5/TiO2 catalysts were prepared by the equilibrium
   adsorption method using a high surface area TiO2 anatase powder. They
   were characterized by the following techniques: X-ray diffraction, BET
   surface area measurements, electrical conductivity, electron
   paramagnetic resonance, UV-VIS, laser-Raman spectroscopy and V-51 solid
   State nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The physico-chemical
   characterization shows that vanadium is present in the 5 + oxidation
   state and that the vanadium oxide phase is well dispersed on the surface
   of the support. The conditions of preparation markedly influence the
   nature of the surface species: alkaline pH promotes the formation of
   isolated tetrahedral species, whereas with acidic pH more condensed
   vanadium oxide species, containing octahedrally coordinated vanadium,
   are formed. The calcination gives rise to a further aggregation of the
   surface vanadium oxide phase. The activity of the catalysts in the
   selective reduction of NO by NH3 in the presence of O-2 was determined.
   The analysis of kinetic data combined with the results of
   physico-chemical characterization leads to a good relationship between
   the reaction rate and the amount of octahedrally coordinated vanadium,
   as evaluated by NMR spectra under ambient conditions.}},

   Analysis using,video microscopy reveals that single viral particles are
   propelled in vivo on the tip of actin tails, at a speed of 2.8 mu m

   outwards on actin projections at a similar rate, to contact and infect

Abstract = {{Background. Reverse-transcriptase inhibitors have only moderate clinical
   efficacy against the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).
   Ritonavir is an inhibitor of HIV-1 pretease with potent in vitro
   anti-HIV properties and good oral bioavailability.
   Methods. We evaluated the antiviral activity and safety of ritonavir in
   a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 1 and 2 study of 84
   HIV-positive patients with 50 or more CD4+ lymphocytes per cubic
   millimeter. The patients were randomly assigned to one of four regimens
   of ritonavir therapy, or to placebo for four weeks and then (by random
   assignment) to one of the ritonavir regimens.
   Results. During the first 4 weeks, increases in CD4+ lymphocyte counts
   and reductions in the log number of copies of HIV-1 RNA per milliliter
   of plasma were similar among the four dosage groups, but in the three
   lower-dosage groups there was a return to base-line levels by 16 weeks.
   After 32 weeks, in the seven patients in the highest-dosage group (600
   mg of ritonavir every 12 hours), the median increase from base line in
   the CD4+ lymphocyte count was 230 cells per cubic millimeter, and the
   mean decrease in the plasma concentration of HIV-1 RNA (as measured by a
   branched-chain DNA assay) was 0.81 log (95 percent confidence interval,
   0.40 to 1.22). In a subgroup of 17 patients in the two higher-dosage
   groups, RNA was also measured with an assay based on the polymerase
   chain reaction, and after eight weeks of treatment there was a mean
   maximal decrease in viral RNA of 1.94 log (95 percent confidence
   interval, 1.37 to 2.51). Adverse events included nausea, circumoral
   paresthesia, elevated hepatic aminotransferase levels, and elevated
   triglyceride levels. Ten withdrawals from the study were judged to be
   related to ritonavir treatment.
   Conclusions. In this short-term study, ritonavir was well tolerated and
   had potent activity against HIV-1, but its clinical benefits remain to
   be established.}},

Abstract = {{The present findings provide experimental evidence for the hypothesis
   that an impairment of mitochondrial function may be involved in
   manganese neurotoxicity. Specifically, the treatment of dopaminergic
   neuronal-derived cell line (PC12) with MnCl2 produced a significant
   inhibition of some mitochondrial complexes of the respiratory chain,
   while in the glial-derived cell line (C6) this effect was not observed.
   In PC12 the decrease in complex I activity was more pronounced than in
   other mitochondrial complexes. However treatment of cells with ZnSO4
   exerted no significant variations in enzymatic activities. A direct
   exposure of mitochondrial fraction to MnCl2 reduced enzymatic activities
   of mitochondria in both cell lines adding further support to the
   proposed theory that the different sensitivity of the cells to manganese
   may be explained by a difference in uptake or intracellular storage.
   These data indicate that manganese neurotoxicity could be the result of
   a direct effect just on complex I activity or due to a secondary effect
   of oxidative stress induced by an excess of this transition metal.}},

Abstract = {{The reactions of pyrrole and thiophene monomers in copper-exchanged
   mordenite have been investigated using EPR and UV-VIS absorption
   spectroscopy. The EPR spectra show a decrease in the intensity of the
   Cu2+ signal and the appearance of a radical signal due to the formation
   of oxidatively coupled oligomeric and/or polymeric species in the
   zeolite host. The reaction ceases when ca. 50\% of the copper has
   reacted and differences in the form of the residual Cu2+ signal between
   the thiophene and pyrrole reactions suggest a greater degree of
   penetration of the reaction into the zeolite host for pyrrole, in
   agreement with previous XPS measurements. The EPR signal intensities
   show that the average length of the polymer chain that is associated
   with each radical centre is 15-20 and 5-7 monomer units for polypyrrole
   and polythiophene, respectively. The widths of the EPR signals suggest
   that these are at least partly due to small oligomers.
   The UV-VIS absorption spectra of the thiophene system show bands in
   three main regions: 2.8-3.0 eV (A), 2.3 eV (B) and 1.6-1.9 eV (D, E, F).
   Bands A and D-F occur in regions which have previously been observed for
   small oligomers, 4-6 monomer units in length. Band B is assigned to
   longer chain polythiophene molecules. We therefore conclude that the
   reaction between thiophene and copper-loaded mordenite produces a
   mixture of short oligomers together with some long chain polythiophene.
   The UV-VIS spectra of the pyrrole system show bands in the regions 3.6
   eV (A), 2.7-3.0 eV (B, C) and 1.5-1.9 eV (D, F). Assignments of these
   bands are less certain than for the thiophene case because of the lack
   of literature data on the spectra of pyrrole oligomers.}},

Abstract = {{Liquid GaCl3 and GaCl3-NaCl mixtures oxidize bismuth metal to subvalent
   bismuth cations and such species are also formed in Bi-GaCl3-benzene and
   Bi-BiCl3-GaCl3-benzene solutions at room temperature. In Bi-GaCl3 and
   Bi-GaCl3-NaCl melts, Ga-71 NMR, UV-VIS and Raman spectroscopy identify
   Ga+, halogallate(III) ions, Bi+ and the cluster Bi-5(3+) as reaction
   products and Bi-5(GaCl4)(3) can be crystallized from Bi-GaCl3 melts.
   Furthermore, Raman spectra and powder diffraction data or quenched
   samples of the Bi-GaCl3 system give evidence for the formation of more
   reduced bismuth clusters at high formal bismuth concentrations. In
   benzene solution, Bi+ and Bi-5(3+) formed; no evidence for other, more
   reduced, species are found. In order to interpret the Ga-71 NMR and
   Raman spectra of the Bi-GaCl3-benzene system properly, a detailed
   investigation of the Ga-GaCl3-benzene system was undertaken. The
   spectroscopic data from this system support the view that the
   chlorogallate(III) ion accompanying the subvalent ions Ga+ and Bi-5(3+)
   in Bi-GaCl3-benzene solution is Ga3Cl10-. Liquid X-ray scattering (LXS)
   measurements confirm the speciation of the Bi-GaCl3-benzene system and
   show that the structure of Bi-5(3+) is virtually identical with that in
   the solid state. Interactions between Bi-5(3+) and the aromatic solvent
   are evident from a Raman band at 986 cm(-1) next to the most intense
   band of C6H6 at 992 cm(-1). However, LXS and C-13 NMR are inconclusive
   as to the nature of this interaction. Upon dilution of Bi-GaCl3-benzene
   solutions by n-heptane, a new modification of Bi-5(GaCl4)(3)
   precipitates, as shown by powder diffraction. Rietveld analysis shows
   this modification to possess cubic symmetry (Fm3c, a = 17.114 Angstrom)
   and a high degree of structural disorder.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of intermolecular hydrogen bonding on the photophysical and
   photochemical processes of a naphthalene-triethylamine system in the
   absence and presence of alcohols was studied. It is shown that the
   presence of alcohols reduces both the apparent bimolecular rate constant
   for the quenching of naphthalene fluorescence by triethylamine and the
   quantum yields of the products in the order 2-methyl-2-propanol <
   2-propanol < ethanol < methanol. It is concluded that the hydrogen
   bonding interaction between the amine and the alcohol suppresses the
   electron transfer process from triethylamine to the excited singlet
   state of naphthalene due to the decrease in the concentration of the
   free amine, and the alcohol acts as a proton donor leading to a strong
   decrease in the yield of the adduct of naphthalene with triethylamine.
   The equilibrium constants for the intermolecular hydrogen bonding of
   triethylamine with alcohols were estimated from the quenching of the
   naphthalene fluorescence by triethylamine in the absence and presence of
   alcohols.}},

Abstract = {{The present study was undertaken to characterize the contractile effects
   of vanadate on thoracic aorta rings from virgin and term-pregnant rats.
   Vanadate caused concentration-dependent contraction in rat aortic rings
   with an EC(50) (concentration producing 50\% maximum response) of 0.10
   mM. Contractions in response to vanadate were equivalent to the ones
   measured with 1 mu M phenylephrine. The effects of vanadate were not
   affected by indomethacin (up to 10 mu M), an inhibitor of prostanoid
   cyclooxygenase, but were blocked in a concentration-dependent manner by
   staurosporine (0.1-1.0 mu M), an inhibitor of protein kinase C. Vanadate
   exhibited a significant decrease of contractile responses in aorta of
   pregnant as compared to virgin rats. When aortic rings were bathed in
   presence of different concentrations of vanadate, the
   concentration-response curve to phenylephrine was shifted to the left,
   but maximum response was not affected. The potentiation of the
   contractions to phenylephrine by vanadate was significantly more
   prominent in aorta of virgin than of pregnant rats. These results
   suggest that the contractile effect of vanadate on rat aorta is
   independent of endogenous prostanoids and may be mediated by protein
   kinase C-dependent pathway. These results also show that the contractile
   response to vanadate on the rat aorta is impaired during pregnancy.}},

Abstract = {{Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major cause of chronic viral
   hepatitis and liver cirrhosis worldwide. HBV has been characterized in
   great detail and can be specifically identified by serological and
   molecular techniques. Chronic hepatitis B frequently progresses to liver
   cirrhosis with its clinical sequelae and is associated with the
   development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Strategies aimed at the
   prevention of liver cirrhosis include primary prevention of HBV
   infection by various measures as well as secondary prevention by therapy
   of acute or chronic hepatitis B as precursors of liver cirrhosis and HCC
   development. For the treatment of chronic hepatitis B interferon-alpha
   or -beta are the only drugs currently available for clinical use in
   selected patients. Given their limited efficacy, combination therapies
   of interferon-alpha or -beta with synthetic antiviral agents or other
   drugs as well-as gene therapy strategies are presently being explored.
   These molecular strategies are designed to specifically deliver
   antiviral nucleic acids to infected cells, thereby improving therapeutic
   efficacy and reducing extrahepatic side-effects.}},

Abstract = {{We have analyzed the proteolytic activity of a recombinant form of
   apolipoprotein(a) {[}r-apo(a)], A mutant 17-kringle form of r-apo(a) was
   engineered that contained a serine to arginine substitution which
   reinstates the tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) cleavage site in
   the protease domain of r-apo(a), The mutant form of r-apo(a) was cleaved
   by tPA as determined by SDS-PAGE and fluorography and by Western blot
   analysis, However, tPA cleavage did not result in an active protease as
   both wildtype r-apo(a) and the mutant, either free or incorporated into
   r-Lp(a) particles, were uniformly inactive against a variety of
   chromogenic serine protease tripeptide substrates. To assess whether the
   large number of kringle IV repeats present in apo(a) inhibits
   proteolytic activity, we generated truncated forms of the Ser-->Arg
   mutant containing one or 10 kringle IV repeats. These truncated versions
   of r-apo(a) were susceptible to cleavage by tPA but were inactive
   against the plasmin substrate S-2251. Treatment of the Ser-->Arg mutant
   of the 17-kringle r-apo(a) with tPA and diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP)
   did not result in modification of the mutant protease domain by DFP.
   Finally, we incubated r-apo(a) or r-Lp(a) particles formed in vitro with
   purified human LDL; no degradation of LDL was observed after 16 h at 37
   degrees C. The results of this study suggest that one or more of the
   substitutions present in the protease domain of apo(a), in addition to
   the Arg-->Ser substitution, render apo(a) proteolytically inactive.}},

Abstract = {{Leaves of the C4 plant maize have two major types of photosynthetic
   cells: a ring of five large bundle sheath cells (BSC) surrounds each
   vascular bundle and smaller mesophyll cells (MC) lie between the
   cylinders of bundle sheath cells. The enzyme ribulose bisphosphate
   carboxylase/oxygenase is encoded by nuclear rbcS and chloroplast rbcL
   genes, it is not present in MC but is abundant in adjacent BSC of green
   leaves, As reported previously, the separate regions of rbcS-m3, which
   are required for stimulating transcription of the gene in BSC and for
   suppressing expression of reporter genes in MC, were identified by an in
   situ expression assay: expression was not suppressed in MC until after
   leaves of dark-grown seedlings had been illuminated for 24 h. Now we
   have found that transient expression of rbcS-m3 reporter genes is
   stimulated in BSC via a red/far-red reversible phytochrome
   photoperception and signal transduction system but that blue light is
   required for suppressing rbcS-m3 reporter gene expression in MC. Blue
   light is also required for the suppression system to develop in MC.
   Thus, the maize gene rbcS-m3 contains certain sequences that are
   responsive to a phytochrome photoperception and signal transduction
   system and other regions that respond to a UVA/blue light
   photoperception and signal transduction system, Various models of
   `'coaction'' of plant photoreceptors have been advanced; these
   observations show the basis for one type of coaction.}},

Abstract = {{The promoted electro-oxidation of aqueous sulphur dioxide at platinum
   electrodes has been studied in acidic medium with the aid of cyclic
   voltammetry and in-situ FT-IR spectroscopy. Promotion of SO2 oxidation
   is achieved when adsorbed SO2 is reduced previously to adsorbed sulphur.
   On a platinum surface covered by sulphur in this way, an enhancement of
   SO2 oxidation is attained. Spectroscopic evidence demonstrates that,
   like oxidation of SO2 in the oxygen adsorption region, soluble S(VI) is
   the ultimate reaction product of the catalysed SO2 oxidation. The
   electroreduction of SO2 has been dealt with by using the same
   techniques. Besides a surface process converting adsorbed SO2 into
   adsorbed sulphur, bulk SO2 reduces irreversibly giving rise to a
   diffusion-limited voltammetric peak. The absence of significant IR bands
   in the potential region at which reduction of built SO2 takes place,
   allows discarding the generation of S-H containing species. A sulphur +
   polysulphide mixture is suggested as the ultimate product, yet whether
   this mixture is formed directly in the electron-transfer step or stems
   from chemical decomposition of sulphur-oxygen short lifetime
   intermediates is not clear. Reduction of SO2 leads to a progressive
   accumulation of sulphur on the platinum surface. An excess of adsorbed
   sulphur negatively affects the kinetic stages of both oxidation and
   reduction of bulk SO2.}},

Abstract = {{Arabidopsis thaliana mutants originally isolated as hypersensitive to
   irradiation were screened for the ability to be transformed by
   Agrobacterium transferred DNA (T-DNA), One of four UV-hypersensitive
   mutants and one of two gamma-hypersensitive mutants tested showed a
   significant reduction in the frequency of stable transformants compared
   with radioresistant controls. In a transient assay for T-DNA transfer
   independent of genomic integration, both mutant lines took up and
   expressed T-DNA as efficiently as parental lines. These lines are
   therefore deficient specifically in stable T-DNA integration and thus
   provide direct evidence for the role of a plant function in that
   process, As radiation hypersensitivity suggests a deficiency in repair
   of DNA damage, that plant function may be one that is also involved in
   DNA repair, possibly, from other evidence, in repair of double-strand
   DNA breaks.}},

Abstract = {{Microbes play an important role in the dissolution of natural and
   synthetic glasses. The frequent technical use of glass and the abundance
   of glass at the earth's surface make this process one of the most
   important weathering reactions. In particular the alteration of volcanic
   glass provides a direct pathway for mantle-derived materials into the
   hydrosphere. To begin understanding the kinetics of these processes, we
   carried out three experiments exposing to seawater polished surfaces of
   nuclear-waste glass. The durations of experiments were: 410 days with
   continuously flowing sand-filtered, unsterilized seawater (approx. 2 X
   10(6) 1; Exp. 1), 126 days with a marine cyanobacterium culture (50 ml,
   Exp. 2), and for 225 days under sterile conditions (250 ml, Exp. 3). The
   sterile experiment (Exp. 3) did not show significant signs of
   alteration. Exp. 1 resulted in development of a several mu m thick
   biofilm and surface corrosion with grooves exceeding 10 mu m in length
   and 0.5 mu m in width. Cyanobacterial cultures also developed a biofilm
   on the glass surfaces, thinner than in Exp. 1. The glass surfaces
   themselves were corroded with approximately 0.5-mu m-sized pits
   clustering in 5 mu m broad zones parallel to the polishing direction.
   These experiments show that biofilms develop within months and the
   corrosion of glass is enhanced by the presence of bacteria, The time
   scales of biologically mediated glass corrosion are fast when compared
   to most geological processes. We expect that volcanic ash is rapidly
   colonized in the oceanic water column, in deep-sea sediments, and in
   soils. The biological degradation of basaltic glass may contribute
   significantly to the oceanic nutrient cycle, the chemical exchange
   between bottom waters and marine sediments, and the fertility of
   volcanic soils.}},

Abstract = {{Liposomal delivery of gene therapy to the colonic epithelium has been
   evaluated in a rodent model. The use of beta-galactosidase as a reporter
   gene demonstrated uptake and expression in virtually 100\% of the
   epithelial cells which contacted the liposome-gene mixture. Expression
   was transient, persisting for 2-3 days, diminishing in accordance with
   normal epithelial turnover. Similar results were seen in both rats and
   mice. The method was used to deliver the APC tumor suppressor gene to
   rat colonic epithelium. Expression of RNA was verified by means of RNAse
   protection, as well as by an exon-connection strategy utilizing
   reverse-transcription. A 6-week period of bi-weekly retreatment
   established safety and minimal toxicity of this route; in particular,
   there were no obvious changes in cell growth or differentiation with

Abstract = {{The olfactory epithelium, which retains a capacity for neurogenesis
   throughout life, contains two categories of basal cells, dark/horizontal
   and light/globose, neither of which is fully characterized with respect
   to their function during the processes of neurogenesis and epithelial
   reconstitution after injury. The aim of this study was to define the
   potential biological role(s) of dark/horizontal basal cells (D/HBCs) in
   the epithelium by performing immunochemical, electron microscopic, and
   developmental analyses of this cell population. The D/HBCs express
   several specific immunochemical characteristics, which include the rat
   homologues of human cytokeratins 5 and 14, which were identified on the
   basis of staining with subunit-specific monoclonal antibodies and
   two-dimensional immunoblot analysis of the immunoreactive proteins.
   Indeed, the D/HBCs are the only cells in the olfactory mucosa that
   express these specific cytokeratins. The D/HBCs also express an
   alpha-galactose or alpha-N-acetyl galactosamine moiety to which the I
   beta(4) isolectin from Bandeiraea simplicifolia binds. Moreover, the
   D/HBCs are heavily labeled by two different antibodies against the EGF
   receptor and by a monoclonal antibody that binds to phosphotyrosine.
   These characteristics are also common to the basal cells of respiratory
   epithelium. The electron microscopic analysis of the basal region of the
   olfactory epithelium and the light microscopic immunofluorescence
   observations demonstrate that the D/HBCs provide a bridge between the
   basal processes of some sustentacular cells and the basal lamina. The
   most striking ultrastructural feature of the D/HBCs is their enfolding
   of virtually all bundles of olfactory axons within tunnels formed where
   D/HBCs arch over the basal lamina. The intimacy of the arrangement
   between D/HBCs and olfactory axons suggests that signals may pass from
   axons to D/HBCs or vice-versa. With respect to the development of
   D/HBCs, cells that express cytokeratins 5 and 14 and the EGF receptor
   first appear near the boundary with respiratory epithelium late in
   development, but do not extend throughout the olfactory epithelium until
   the middle of the first postnatal week. Taken together, the present
   findings and previously published data suggest that D/HBCs help to
   maintain the structural integrity of the olfactory epithelium,
   participate in its recovery from injury, and may also function to signal
   the status of the neuronal population of the epithelium. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{Neutron reflectometry (NR) was used to measure the concentration profile
   of a symmetric PEP/dPEP polymer blend with nanometer-scale resolution in
   the one-phase region. The shape of the profile near the surface was
   found to differ significantly from mean-field theory predictions for all
   bulk concentrations and temperatures surveyed. The profile shape is
   flattened at the surface over a distance about half the bulk correlation
   length, a length scale far greater than that of the dispersive forces
   that are the dominant microscopic interaction in such blends. We
   introduce a new method for extracting the surface energy difference that
   drives segregation based on the Gibbs adsorption equation (GAE) and
   compare it to a previous method based on mean-field theory. While both
   methods produce qualitatively similar results (the surface energy of
   pure dPEP is similar to 0.21 mJ/m(2) smaller than pure PEP), the GAE
   method is much less model dependent, requiring knowledge of only the
   free energy of mixing in the bulk and the measured integral excess and
   surface composition. The surface energy difference between dPEP and PEP
   is similar to 2.6 times larger than that for dPS and PS, a factor in
   good agreement with the expectation that the surface energy difference
   between the isotopically different polymers arises from the same van der
   Waals interaction that leads to a positive Flory segment-segment
   interaction parameter chi in these blends.}},

Abstract = {{Using antibodies recognizing the phosphorylation state of specific
   sites, phosphorylation states of tau were monitored in fetal rat primary
   cultured neurons. When cultured neurons were treated with okadaic acid
   (OA) or calyculin A (CalA) at concentrations sufficient to inhibit
   protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), phosphorylation of Ser-199/Ser-202
   (numbered according to the human tau 441) and Ser-235 increased. On the
   other hand, treatment with Ca2+ ionophore, A23187, induced
   dephosphorylation of Ser-199/Ser-202, Thr-205, Ser-396 and Ser-404, and
   this dephosphorylation was repressed by inhibitors of protein
   phosphatase 2B (PP2B), cyclosporin A and FK506. These results indicate
   that PP2A and PP2B are differentially involved in dephosphorylation of
   tau in neurons.}},

   cyclodextrins (HP-alpha-, HP-beta- and HP-gamma-CyDs) as biocompatible
   solubilizers and stabilizers for oleic acid, a lipophilic absorption
   enhancer, was assessed in the nasal absorption of buserelin, an agonist
   of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, in rats, HP-CyDs increased the
   aqueous solubility of oleic acid and protected it against oxidation
   through the formation of inclusion complexes with the efficacy
   increasing in the order: HP-gamma-CyD<<HP-alpha-CyD<HP-beta-CyD., The
   bend structure due to a cis-double bond halfway along the acyl chain of
   oleic acid provided a better fit into the cavity of HP-beta-CyD, in
   which the double bond appears to be buried, and hence becomes less
   susceptible to oxidation, The rate and extent of nasal bioavailability
   of buserelin were remarkably increased by coadministration of oleic acid
   and HP-beta-CyD, compared with the sole use of the enhancer, This
   enhancement was ascribable to the lowering of both the enzymatic and
   physical barriers of the nasal epithelium to the peptide, probably
   through the facilitated transmucosal penetration of oleic acid
   solubilized in HP-beta-CyD.}},

Abstract = {{From a sample of 1.5 million Z(0) --> <q(q)over bar> decays collected by
   the DELPHI detector during 1991, 1992 and 1993, the production cross
   section for isolated final state photons is measured and is compared
   with the O(alpha, alpha(s)) matrix element calculations implemented in
   the EEPRAD and GNJETS Monte Carlo generators. The observed photon yield
   is used to derive the electroweak couplings of charge 2/3 (u-type) and
   charge 1/3 (d-type) quarks to the Z(0) boson. The measured values C-2/3
   = 0.91(-0.36)(+0.25) and c(1/3) = 1.62(-0.17)(+0.24) are compatible with
   the Standard Model prediction, C-2/3 = 1.145 and c(1/3) = 1.477.}},

Abstract = {{Senior managers have tended to resist the incursion into their personal
   domain of computer systems meant for their use. Their main criticism is
   that technical solutions are being imposed on them without an adequate
   analysis of the problems at hand. This suggests that the way in which
   executives obtain and exchange information may not he adequately
   understood. With the help of a framework designed to identify top
   executives' networks of information Bows, the study reported in this
   paper analysed the information practices of 16 executives from four
   organizations. The findings of the research indicated that executives
   use a combination of communication Bows and information Bows in a
   proportion which varies depending upon the context of their different
   activities. It also revealed that executives initiated information and
   communication Bows of a different nature depending upon the role they
   play and the level of those with whom they deal within the organization.
   The results of the study suggest that very specific approaches are
   needed when identifying executives' needs in terms of developing systems
   aimed at supporting top managers' strategic activities.}},

Abstract = {{Whilst investigators have clearly shown that non-hereditary factors
   dominate the aetiology of human breast cancer, they have failed to
   identify quantitatively important causes, and prospects for prevention
   remain indeed limited. However, progress in epidemiological and basic
   research has taken place during the last few years. Current evidence
   suggests that breast cancer may be affected by the intra-uterine
   environment, that exposures during adolescence are particularly
   important, and that pregnancy has a dual effect on breast cancer risk:
   an early increase followed by long-term protection. Great variation
   exists in the structural development of the breast ductal system already
   in the newborn - and by inference in utero - and a pregnancy induces
   permanent structural changes in the mammary gland. We suggest that these
   observations fit into an aetiological model with the following key
   components: (1) breast cancer risk depends on the number of cells at
   risk, the susceptibility of individual cells to malignant
   transformation, and on the degree of cellular proliferation, notably
   cells which can act as founders of breast cancer; (2) the number of
   target cells is determined by the hormonal environment mainly early in
   life, perhaps already in utero; (3) in adult life, hormones which are
   non-genotoxic, increase breast cancer risk by increasing selective cell
   proliferation and thus number of target cells and the risk of retention
   of spontaneous somatic mutations; (4) while a pregnancy stimulates the
   growth of already malignant cells or cells close to malignant
   transformation (and thereby entails a short-term risk increase) the
   dominating long-term protection occurs due to permanent structural
   changes, terminal differentiation and perhaps decreased cell
   proliferation and carcinogen-binding in combination.}},

Abstract = {{Results are presented of a questionnaire survey of speed-related
   risk-taking performed on 572 British company car drivers. Reported
   risk-taking was examined in relation to risk and utility perceptions as
   well as perceived control and driver self-perceptions. The data revealed
   that over half the sample reported often exceeding the motorway speed
   limit by at least 10 mph (16 km/h). It was found that drivers who more
   frequently exceeded the speed limit on motorways were less likely to
   view speeding as an important risk factor and were much more likely to
   view being on time for appointments as desirable. They were also likely
   to view themselves as less aware, less sociable and more confident. The
   importance of the perceived utility of arriving at appointments on time,
   in relation to speeding over the legal limit, suggests that some
   organizational measures to reduce perceived time pressure within company
   vehicle drivers could be beneficial.}},

   examined. For this purpose, the critical dimensions of a family of
   composite quadratic tensor operators in the velocity gradient are found.
   Considered in the one-loop approximation, the contribution of these
   operators turns out to be less substantial (although not significantly)
   than the contribution of the linear term. The derived asymptotics of the

   patterns in multivariate data. In this study the use of neural networks
   with a single serum sample for rapid real-time recognition of recent

   implemented on the basis of data obtained by four serological
   methods-dye test, indirect fluorescence assay, indirect hemagglutination
   assay, and IgM immunosorbent agglutination assay-and was `'trained'' to
   extract features of acute infection by application to an analysis of 65
   immunocompetent patients, 10 of whom were in fact acutely infected. The
   trained model correctly classified all 10 cases of acute infection. On
   its application to 61 additional infected patients, this method
   correctly identified seven cases as potentially acute. Our study shows
   that neural networks can discern diagnostic patterns from variables that

Abstract = {{Apnea, cardiac arrhythmias, and sudden death occur occasionally in
   raptors when isoflurane is used as the sole anesthetic agent. Twelve
   bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) were each subjected to two 30-min
   sessions of anesthesia in which isoflurane was the sole anesthetic
   agent. Electrocardiograms were obtained before induction and after 30
   min of anesthesia. Continuous lead II: electrocardiographic monitoring
   was initiated before induction and continued until after recovery. Pulse
   and O-2 saturation were monitored on all birds with a plethysmograph.
   Continuous gas flow was monitored following intubation with a sidestream
   gas analyzer. In live randomly selected birds, 1 mi of venous blood was
   drawn at predetermined intervals from the ulnar vein into a syringe and
   refrigerated for subsequent blood gas and electrolyte analysis. Levels
   of venous O-2, PCO2, potassium, and pH were determined for each sample.
   In the same five birds, mean arterial and systolic blood pressures were
   monitored indirectly every 3 min. Temperatures were measured at the same
   intervals as those used for blood sampling. Arrhythmias were observed in
   75\% of the eagles and occurred during periods of induction or recovery
   in 80\% of the cases. Though hypercarbia was suspected as a contributing
   factor, paired sample t-test analysis of measured data failed to
   indicate causality.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of a selective leukotriene receptor antagonist, the peptide
   ICI 198,615, on thrombin-induced pulmonary edema was studied in rats,
   Administration of thrombin produced a significant increase in lung
   weight (p < 0.05), wet weight to dry weight ratio (WW/DW; p < 0.05), and
   relative lung water content (p < 0.05). These increases were all
   significantly reduced (p < 0.05) by ICP 198,615 (bolus 15 mg/kg,
   infusion 15 mg/kg/h). Thrombin infusion caused a significant increase in
   myeloperoxidase activity in the lung tissue (p < 0.05), This increase
   was further accentuated by ICI 198,615, indicating that the effect of
   this antagonist is not due to reduction of leukocyte infiltration in the
   lungs, The results thus show that a leukotriene receptor antagonist
   effectively counteracts the increase in lung vascular permeability to
   protein caused by thrombin, and indicate that leukotrienes are important
   mediators of thrombin-induced pulmonary edema in the rat.}},

Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1653-1656}},

Abstract = {{The oral administration of glycine remarkably decreased the blood
   ethanol level in mice which had ingested ethanol, and a large amount of
   ethanol was retained in their stomachs. These effects were observed by
   the oral administration of glycine previous to the ethanol ingestion,
   and depended on the dose of glycine. An intravenous injection of glycine
   did not affect the ethanol absorption at all. These findings indicate
   that glycine suppresses the rate of ethanol absorption from the
   gastrointestinal tract. Glycylglycine, glycylglycylglycine and alanine
   showed the same effects, but glucose did not. However, ethanol
   absorption from the ligated stomach of mouse was inhibited not only by
   glycine but also by glucose. On the other hand, the rate of ejecting a
   pigment from the stomach to the small intestine was lowered by glycine,
   but not by glucose. Thus, glycine lowers the gastric emptying rate,
   resulting in the suppression of ethanol absorption from the
   gastrointestinal tract.}},

Abstract = {{An adaptive mechanism controls the strength of innervation to the two
   eyes independently. However, under some circumstances an adjustment in
   strength of innervation to one eye is generalized to the other. The
   coupling and uncoupling of the two eyes during saccadic motor learning
   was studied using the technique of intrasaccadic target displacements to
   provide a precise visual-motor error proportional to the commanded
   movement. Early adaptive changes (saccade plus fast vergence) were
   measured within the saccadic interval and late adaptive changes
   (vergence error) were measured after the saccadic interval, When one
   viewing eye was retrained using intrasaccadic displacements, saccadic
   amplitude changes generalized to the other nonviewing eye. Thus, rapid
   adaptive changes trained monocularly were transferred to the nonviewing
   eye. But when two eyes were viewing and an adaptive stimulus was
   provided to only one eye (binocular viewing-monocular training),
   adaptive changes also occurred in both eyes. Experiments described here
   suggest that the recalibration of the saccade occurs quickly as a
   conjugate adjustment of gain which is used to balance innervation to the
   two eyes. Thereafter, disconjugate mechanisms provide a further
   recalibration to each eye independently.}},

   the phenomenon. However, some current research has been more favorable
   to the trait approach. The present research examined cross-situational
   stability in leadership by having leaders (people who held current
   formal leadership positions) interact with nonleaders on four tasks that
   required social organization and coordination. As predicted, stability
   in leadership across the four tasks and some evidence for consistency
   across groups were found, as was a high level of consensus and accuracy

Abstract = {{Eight highly variable microsatellite loci were used to examine the
   genetic variability and differentiation of grey seals (Halichoerus
   grypus) at two widely spaced British breeding colonies. Samples were
   collected from adults and pups on the island of North Rona, off the
   north-west coast of Scotland, and on the Isle of May, situated at the
   mouth of the Firth of Forth on the east coast. Highly significant
   differences in allele frequencies between these two sites were found for
   all eight loci, indicating considerable genetic differentiation. Thus,
   although grey seals are known to range over very large areas outside the
   breeding season, site fidelity of adults and philopatry of pups for
   these breeding colonies must be sufficiently common to have effects,
   through genetic drift, at the sub-population level. Migration rate was
   estimated using Wright's fixation index (F-ST), Slatkin's private
   alleles model and the new statistic, R(ST), which is analogous to F-ST
   but which takes into account the process of microsatellite mutation. An
   almost 8-fold discrepancy between the values we obtained provides
   cautionary evidence that microsatellite loci may contravene one or more
   of the assumptions on which these methods are based.}},

   per asymmetric unit, a = 9.202(4) Angstrom, b = 10.139(2) Angstrom, c =
   38.089 Angstrom alpha = 96.05(1)degrees, beta = 84.29(3)degrees, and
   gamma = 96.71(3)degrees. Molecules adopt a zigzag conformation, with the
   four alkoxy chains stretched and approximately parallel to the (yet)
   plane; the mean axis of the alkoxy chains makes an angle close to 140
   degrees with the central core, and the molecules are arranged in sheets
   of about 38 Angstrom thickness, as in a smectic C mesophase. The smectic
   C phase is analyzed by X-ray diffraction and dilatometry. The molecular
   arrangement in the mesophase is found to be very similar to that in the

   predetermines the type of mesophase observed at high temperature with
   small variations of the structural parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Tuberculosis (TB) serological testing with antigen complexes, although
   very sensitive, is not always as specific due to reactive serum
   antibodies in patients with inactive TB or nontuberculous infections.
   Since the use of recombinant M. tuberculosis proteins may enhance
   specificity, this study was designed to evaluate a novel 34 kDa
   tuberculosis complex-specific protein as a component of an antigen panel
   of recombinant proteins.
   Seventy patients with active TB (41 positive and 29 negative for
   acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in sputum) were evaluated, in comparison with 30
   tuberculin purified protein derivative skin test positive (PPD+) and 30
   PPD- normals, 20 subjects with inactive TB and 20 PPD+ subjects with
   nontuberculous pneumonia as controls. Serum antibody levels were
   quantified using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests with
   MS2-34, a fusion protein comprising the NH2-terminal 16 kDa of the 34
   kDa protein, a recombinant 38 kDa protein (p38), and PPD.
   Using MS2-34 and p38 as an antigen panel in active TB patients yielded
   higher sensitivity and negative predictive value (sensitivity 86\%;
   negative predictive value 91\%) than using PPD (sensitivity 66\%;
   negative predictive value 81\%). Importantly, the MS2-34+p38 panel
   yielded a higher sensitivity (83\%) than PPD (66\%) in the subset of
   AFB- active TB patients.
   Thus, this novel protein increases sensitivity and specificity of
   serological testing for TB when used in panels of recombinant proteins.}},

Abstract = {{Aims-To assess quantitatively variations in the extent of capillary
   basement membrane (BM) thickening between different retinal layers and
   within arterial and venous environments during diabetes.
   Methods-One year after induction of experimental (streptozotocin)
   diabetes in rats, six diabetic animals together with six age-matched
   control animals were sacrificed and the retinas fixed for transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM). Blocks of retina straddling the major
   arteries and veins in the central retina were dissected out, embedded in
   resin, and sectioned. Capillaries in close proximity to arteries or
   veins were designated as residing in either an arterial (AE) or a venous
   (VE) environment respectively, and the retinal layer in which each
   capillary was located was also noted. The thickness of the BM was then
   measured on an image analyser based two dimensional morphometric
   analysis system.
   Results-In both diabetics and controls the AE capillaries had
   consistently thicker BMs than the VE capillaries. The BMs of both AE and
   VE capillaries from diabetics were thicker than those of capillaries in
   the corresponding retinal layer from the normal rats (p less than or
   equal to 0.005). Also, in normal AE and VE capillaries and diabetic AE
   capillaries the BM in the nerve fibre layer (NFL) was thicker than that
   in either the inner (IPL) or outer (OPL) plexiform layers (p less than
   or equal to 0.001). However, in diabetic VE capillaries the BMs of
   capillaries in the NFL were thicker than those of capillaries in the IPL
   (p less than or equal to 0.05) which, in turn, had thicker BMs than
   capillaries in the OPL (p less than or equal to 0. 005).
   Conclusions-The variation in the extent of capillary BM thickening
   between different retinal layers within AE and VE environments may be
   related to differences in levels of oxygen tension and oxidative stress
   in the retina around arteries compared with that around veins.}},

Abstract = {{The present study characterizes the effect of two nitric oxide (NO)
   donors, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP), on
   the ability of neutrophils to perform different responses triggered by
   immune complexes (IC). Pretreatment of neutrophils with either GSNO or
   SNP exerted a biphasic action on antibody-dependent cellular
   cytotoxicity (ADCC) performed against erythrocytes (E) coated with IgG
   antibodies (IgG-E), depending on the amount of IgG employed. While with
   high amounts of antibodies ADCC was markedly inhibited, at low amounts
   of antibodies it was significantly increased. Both effects were
   prevented by haemoglobin, a NO scavenger. Moreover, these effects were
   reproduced by the cell-permeable analogue of cGMP, dibutyryl cGMP
   (Bt(2)cGMP). Other neutrophil functions triggered by IgG-E were also
   explained. It was found that NO donors did not affect either the
   phagocytosis of IgG-E or the emission of chemiluminescence (CL).
   Finally, neutrophil functions triggered by soluble IC (sIC) and
   precipitating IC (pIC) were analysed. It was observed that NO donors did
   not modify either cytotoxicity performed towards non-sensitized target
   cells or CL emission. The significance of these results is discussed.}},

   multivariate calibration to the on-line analysis of BTEX compounds in
   effluents has been investigated, using synthetic mixtures of toluene,
   ethylbenzene and o-xylene in aqueous solution (0-20 mg l(-1)).
   Absorbance and first- and second-derivative spectral data have been
   modelled using stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), principal
   components regression (PCR) and partial least-squares regression (PLS1).
   Predictions of individual analyte concentrations in test samples
   produced prediction errors ranging from 8.5\% for o-xylene to 45.8\% for
   toluene. The lowest prediction errors (7.0\%) were produced when
   calibrating the three compounds as a single component ('total TEX'), In
   order to analyse industrial effluents, an FI manifold incorporating a
   solvent extraction cell was used to reduce matrix interferences. This
   method was successfully used for the analysis of both aqueous standards
   and solutions of a real effluent spiked with o-xylene, In each case,
   hexane was used to extract o-xylene from the aqueous matrix.}},

Abstract = {{We have isolated specific microsatellite loci from a partial genomic
   library of brook charr Salvelinus fontinalis. Their usefulness was
   investigated by measuring intra- and inter-population genetic diversity
   at four loci among 20 individuals from each of five lakes located 3 to
   22 km apart in La Mauricie national park(Canada). These markers were
   moderately to highly polymorphic. A total of five, six, 16 and 18
   alleles per locus were detected, and their overall expected
   heterozygosity was 0.53, 0.58, 0.86 and 0.87. Strong inter-population
   diversity was detected. Highly significant differences in allelic
   frequencies were found in all but two pairwise KZ permutation tests
   between populations at all loci. Numerous population unique alleles were
   observed in all five lakes. Consequently, a highly significant component
   of total genetic diversity was due to interpopulation variance, as
   exemplified by G(ST) values of 0.33, 0.42, 0.47 and 0.84 for each
   individual locus. Altogether, the results indicated that these loci
   should be valuable in addressing fine scale population genetics
   questions in brook charr. To our knowledge, they also represent the
   first available microsatellites developed in the genus Salvelinus. (C)

Abstract = {{Transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring of the middle cerebral artery
   (MCA) permits the detection of high intensity transient signals (HITS),
   which are believed to represent microemboli. Non-valvular atrial
   fibrillation (NVAF) and prosthetic heart valves (PV) are important risk
   factors for embolic stroke. We evaluated both the prevalence and the
   frequency of microemboli in these high risk groups and the correlation
   with previous stroke. Sixty-six patients were monitored for 30 min on
   both MCAs sequentially. Twenty healthy subjects were studied as well.
   The total number of HITS recorded on both sides, expressed as HITS/h,
   was used for comparison. In NVAF patients (n = 24) the prevalence of
   HITS was 25\%, in PV (n = 16) 62\% and in those patients in whom PV
   coexisted with atrial fibrillation (PVAF) (n = 26), it was 42\%. None in
   the control group showed HITS, HITS occurred significantly more
   frequently in PVAF (12.3/h) than in both NVAF (1.4/h, p = 0.007) and PV
   (2.7/h, p = 0.011), whereas there was no difference between PV and NVAF,
   The prevalence of HITS was not statistically different in patients with
   and without previous stroke, but among HITS positive patients those with
   previous stroke had a significantly higher HITS frequency (18.9 vs
   8.5/h,p = 0.04). In conclusion, in patients with cardiac embolic sources
   the frequency of HITS increases from the classes with the lower (NVAF,
   PV) to the class with the highest (PVAF) risk factor, Patients with
   previous stroke have more HITS than asymptomatic ones. Therefore,
   embolus detection monitoring seems a promising tool in the assessment of
   the individual stroke risk in patients with cardiac embolic sources.}},

Abstract = {{An internal model control (IMC) framework using neural networks for the
   modeling and control of a nonlinear bioreactor is presented. Unlike
   existing IMC design techniques, this approach needs no mathematical
   models. It is shown that, to obtain an accurate inverse model, one needs
   to use steady-state data in addition to the transient data for training
   the networks. An integration of neural networks and an unstructured math
   model of the bioreactor is also proposed to improve the neural networks'
   modeling accuracy. This hybrid approach shows significantly better
   performance than the `'black box'' method, and almost as good a
   performance as a nonlinear IMC based on an exact mathematical model. The
   hybrid method also has other advantages, such as the use of only
   steady-state data and the need for only one neural network that can be
   used for both the process model and the inverse process model.
   Simulation results show that the neural-net strategy is superior to a PI
   controller.}},

Abstract = {{The cuticle of a new cycad, Pseudoctenis ornata Archangelsky et al., sp.
   nov. is described and discussed in relation to the physical
   paleoenvironment in which the plant lived. The specimens occur in the
   Early Cretaceous Baquero Formation, near Estancia El Verano in the Santa
   Cruz Province, Argentina. A detailed stratigraphic section records four
   facies, namely (1) fluvial channel, (2) flood plain, (3) lacustrine, and
   (4) flat and extended plains. A detail of each facies is provided.
   Pseudoctenis cuticles are found in the flood plain facies; the other
   components of the plant association are Gleichenites, Araucaria and
   Taeniopteris. The depositional history of this succession is related to
   a braided river that periodically received volcanic ash. Plants grew
   until complete burial by ash. Leaves of Pseudoctenis are pinnate,
   hypostomatic, with polycyclic stomata that form ill-defined rows.
   Abundant papillae and hair bases are present, especially on the lower
   cuticle. Comparisons are made with other Pseudoctenis species found in
   the same formation, and in other regions of the world. It is suggested
   that the paleoenvironment had a strong influence on the vegetation,
   especially the ash fall, and that it may have played a role in the
   formation of xeromorphic structures that characterize several
   gymnosperms present in this stratigraphic unit, including Pseudoctenis
   ornata. The lack of burning features on the cuticle suggests a cold ash
   fall. This fall probably was responsible for changes in edaphic patterns
   and atmospheric conditions that governed the growth and distribution of
   plant communities during the deposition of the Baquero Formation.}},

Abstract = {{The pupae of Blephariceridae develop in streams and respire by means of
   spiracular gills. Our knowledge about the morphology of these organs is
   limited, and no scanning electron microscopic analyses of their fine
   structure have been carried out. Therefore, ca. 30 representative
   species from all continents and all main taxa of the Blephariceridae
   have been comparatively investigated with respect to their pupal gills.
   This first part of a series of publications on the theme deals with the
   ground plan of the spiracular gills in the subfamily Edwardsininae, with
   special attention paid to the fine structure of the plastron and atrium.
   For this purpose, one or two species from the three geographically
   isolated subpopulations of the Edwardsininae (Madagascar, South America,
   Australia) have been examined and compared with a pupa from the
   Deuterophlebiidae, the sister-group of the Blephariceridae. The results
   are discussed with regard to phylogeny and agree well with recent
   studies on the systematics of the Nematocera. The gills of the
   Edwardsininae have a primitive construction compared with those of the
   other subfamily, the Blepharicerinae, which has a worldwide
   distribution. The supposed functional advantages of spiracular gills and
   the reason for their evolution are critically considered. The findings
   cast some doubts on the usual interpretation that the felt inside the
   atrium serves as a sealant.}},

Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{A mitochondrial plasmid, V5124, in Neurospora intermedia isolate 5124
   has a deletion in its sequence relative to the highly similar
   Mauriceville and Varkud plasmids. These insertions in the latter
   plasmids are 28 bp in length and are positioned at sites that correspond
   to their major transcript 5' termini. The 28-bp sequence is nearly
   identical to a putative processing site upstream of the ND4L gene on the
   mitochondrial genome. The absence of this 28-bp sequence in V5124
   apparently results in transcripts whose 5' termini correspond to an
   upstream consensus promoter sequence. Two variant forms of V5124 coexist
   with V5124 and have either of two similar 0.3-kb inserts positioned
   exactly as is the 28-bp insert in Varkud. These long inserts are
   chimeric, partly deriving from a newly discovered multimeric plasmid,
   MP. MP has significant similarity to a short region of the mitochondrial
   satellite plasmid VS. Another part of the 0.3-kb inserts in V5124
   variants derives from the mitochondrial genome, within restriction
   fragment EcoRI-8. Neurospora mitochondria in many isolates can have
   several types of mitochondrial plasmids belonging to different homology
   groups. We propose that a common ancestral plasmid acquired insertions
   from either the mitochondrial genome or from other plasmids. The V5124
   variants are the first instance of a chimeric mitochondrial plasmid in
   which distinct plasmids have recombined. This recombination proves that
   different plasmids coexist currently, or else did so at some point in
   their evolution, within a single mitochondrion.}},

   variations, including their relation to the net freshwater supply, The
   average salinity from 1990-1992 was approximately 37 psu (compared to 34
   psu in the ocean), while the maximum values during drought periods
   exceeded 50 psu. This hypersaline climate is different from the
   situation in 1960-1961, when the average salinity was less than 30 psu
   under similar meteorological conditions, The increase in salinity is
   most likely due to reduced river discharge, The seasonal salinity
   variation is closely related to the monsoon climate, with rapidly
   decreasing salinities during rainy seasons and increasing salinities
   during drought. Because we experienced great difficulties in obtaining
   reliable data on the river discharge, we calculated the water residence
   times during periods of reduced runoff and minimum rainfall. The average

   inhibited Langerhans cell antigen-presenting capability for elicitation
   of delayed-type hypersensitivity in immunized mice to present
   alloantigens in the mixed epidermal cell-lymphocyte reaction and to
   present a protein antigen to a responsive hybridoma. As a whole, these
   data suggest the possibility that products of nerves within the

Abstract = {{The importance of dental problems in comparison with general health
   problems and psychological problems was judged by 642 adolescents. The
   methods used were paired comparison and direct ranking of nine stimuli.
   Adolescents were quite consistent in their choices. The agreement within
   the group was statistically significant. Adolescents judged dental
   problems as less important than general health problems and as more
   important than psychological problems. The correlation between the
   methods of paired comparison and direct ranking was high. The results
   were compared retrospectively with findings from a study of 51 older
   subjects. Adolescents and adults did not differ much from each other
   except for the ordering of the nine problems. Adults ranked dental
   problems as the least important.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to derive a multivariate, quantitative
   case definition of the fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) facial phenotype
   from a dysmorphologist-derived gold standard and use it to develop an
   effective screening tool for identification of children at risk for FAS,
   The facial and physical features of a racially mixed group of children
   (0.2-10.0 years of age), evaluated by a single dysmorphologist in the
   University of Washington FAS Clinic, were used to determine which
   feature or set of features best differentiated between children with and
   without a diagnosis of FAS. The study population was divided into two
   groups balanced on gender, age at examination, race, diagnosis, and date
   of examination, Group 1 was used to identify the most differentiating
   feature(s), and group 2 was used to validate the differentiating
   capability of the feature(s), Group 1 included 97 children (20 with FAS
   and 77 without FAS), Group 2 included 97 children (19 with FAS and 78
   without FAS), Discriminant analysis identified smooth philtrum, thin
   upper lip, and short palpebral fissures as the cluster of features that
   best differentiated children with and without FAS based on the
   discriminant function {[}D = 1.7953086 + 0.8116083 (thin upper lip) +
   2.6411562 (smooth philtrum) - 3.4073780 (\% predicted right palpebral
   fissure length)]. Patients with a D-score greater than or equal to 1.5
   were classified as at-risk for FAS (screen positive), Using this cut-off
   value for the D-score, children in group 1 were classified with 100\%
   sensitivity (20 of 20 true positives) and 90.0\% specificity (70 of 77
   true negatives). The children in group 2 were classified with 100\%
   sensitivity (19 of 19 true positives) and 87.3\% specificity (68 of 78
   true negatives), Across all 194 patients, sensitivity was 100\% {[}95\%
   confidence interval (97-100)] and specificity was 89\% {[}95\%
   confidence interval (85 to 93)]. Seventy-one percent (n = 12) of the 17
   false-positives had a true classification of possible fetal alcohol
   effects, Sensitivity and specificity were unaffected by race, gender,
   and age through 10 years, This screening tool is effective at
   differentiating children with and without FAS as diagnosed by a single
   dysmorphologist (S.K.C.) at the University of Washington FAS Clinic,
   Assessment of diagnostic interrater agreement between trained
   dysmorphologists and testing in other clinic populations will be needed
   to assess the tool's external validity.}},

Abstract = {{A stable, syntrophic benzoate-degrading bacterial consortium was
   enriched from sewage sludge. It oxidized benzoate or 3-phenylpropionate
   to acetate, H-2 and CO2. As hydrogen scavengers Methanospirillum
   hungatei and Desulfovibrio sp. were present. The benzoate-degrading
   bacteria of this syntrophic culture and of Syntrophus buswellii were
   able to grow with benzoate/crotonate or crotonate alone in the absence
   of a hydrogen-utilizing partner organism. If crotonate was the only
   substrate, acetate and butyrate were produced, while during growth on
   benzoate or 3-phenylpropionate crotonate served as a reducible
   co-substrate and was exclusively converted to butyrate. In the presence
   of crotonate interspecies hydrogen transfer was not necessary as a
   hydrogen sink. The benzoate degrader was isolated as a pure culture with
   crotonate as the only carbon source. The pure culture could also grow
   with benzoate/crotonate or 3-phenylpropionate/crotonate. The effect of
   high concentrations of crotonate and of acetate or butyrate on growth of
   the benzoate degrader was investigated. The benzoate degrader was
   compared with S. buswellii for its morphology, physiology and DNA base
   composition. Except for the fact that S. buswellii was also able to grow
   on cinnamate, no differences between the two organisms were detected.
   The isolate is named S. buswellii, strain GA.}},

Abstract = {{The cyanobacteria Nostoc sp. strain Mac, Anabaena 7937, Synechocystis
   6803, and Anacystis nidulans (Synechococcus 6301) were grown and
   incubated in the light under three different oxygen regimes: Phase-A
   cells were harvested from photo autotrophic al ly growing cultures at a
   cell density of 2.8-3.2 mu l packed cell mass/ml and an oxygen
   concentration of approx. 350 mu M (corresponding to >150\% air
   saturation). Phase-B cells were harvested 24 hrs after 20 mu M
   3-(3,4-dichlorophyl)-1,l-dimethylurea had been added to the culture and
   gassing switched to 1\% oxygen (<10 mu M). Phase-C cells originated from
   phase-B cells after 12 hrs of gassing the illuminated, yet non-growing
   cultures with air (21\% oxygen or 200-220 mu M in the medium).
   Cytoplasmic membranes were isolated and purified from each of the three
   cell types. Non-covalently bound hemes were extracted and identified by
   reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Besides
   ubiquitous heme B only heme A was detected in phase-A membranes while
   phase-B and phase-C membranes contained both hemes A and O proportions

   spectra, photo-action spectra of GO-inhibited oxygen uptake, and
   polarographic determination of oxygen-affinities clearly showed that
   both hemes 4 and O were part of a functional form of cytochrome-e

   verified by immunoblotting. Also electron transport characteristics did
   not give evidence for a quinol or any other alternate oxidase
   functioning in cyanobacteria.}},

   and sublexical processes also were examined. At the initial stage,
   phonemic and pattern-recognition skills were influential for the lexical
   route, but, when formal teaching of reading began, there was a strong
   Matthew effect: Children already good at reading tended to do even
   better the following year. Similar factors affected sublexical
   development initially, but prior phonemic processes and spelling ability
   became important once formal teaching began. There appeared to be an

Abstract = {{Platelet-PMN interactions have been extensively studied and a spectrum
   of possible effects has been demonstrated. However, the physiological
   relevance of many of the observed in vitro phenomena remains obscure.
   Here we report a novel, and potentially pathophysiologically important,
   mechanism by which platelets can enhance PMN reactivity, We first
   observed that addition of platelets to PMN suspensions enhanced the
   chemiluminescence response of PMN to FMLP, This enhancement occurred
   without augmentation of superoxide generation and did not involve mutual
   platelet-PMN adhesion, The soluble material responsible was
   biochemically and immunologically identified as PF4 derived from
   platelet alpha-granules. The alpha-granule release was shown to be
   selective and required minimal platelet stimulation, Since the PF4
   effect did not influence NADPH oxidase activation, it differed markedly
   from that of other priming agents such as GM-CSF, Further studies showed
   that the PF4 effect was attributable entirely to the surface
   translocation and secretion of primary granule myeloperoxidase. There
   was marked synergy between PF4 and GM-CSF and both were required for
   maximal potentiation of PMN reactivity, These results demonstrate that
   PF4 and GM-CSF employ different pathways in PMN priming, The ease with
   which platelets could release PF4 at sites of vessel-wall damage and
   inflammation suggests that platelet-PMN interaction via PF4 is likely to
   be of major pathophysiological importance.}},

Abstract = {{Grass clippings may comprise a minimum of 35\% of yard waste. We
   investigated whether bioavailable herbicide residues in grass clippings
   used as mulch would be toxic to desirable plants. In each of three
   experiments, tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) was treated with
   a mixture of 2,4-D + dicamba + MCPP at 0.5 g total a.i./m(2). Clippings
   were collected at 1-, 5-, 10-, and 15-day postspray intervals. Clippings
   at gram equivalent weights relative to desired mulching depths were
   applied to tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L.), cucumber (Cucumis
   sativus L.), salvia (Salvia splendens F.), and marigold (Tagetes
   tenuifolia Cav.) grown in pots. Plant dry-weight comparisons were made
   at two destructive harvest intervals, from 2 to 5 weeks after mulching.
   No mulch and nontreated mulch treatments were used as controls. Growth
   of tomato and marigold was enhanced when nontreated grass mulch was used
   compared to no mulch, but growth of cucumber and salvia was not
   enhanced. The bioavailable residues relative to the postspray interval
   (1 to 15 days) influenced growth of all species. Mulching depth affected
   growth of all species, except salvia. Herbicide-treated mulch reduced
   dry weight by less than or equal to 80\% for cucumber, 73\% for tomato,
   65\% for marigold, and 34\% for salvia compared to controls. Herbicide
   residues apparently increased with mulching depth, resulting in a
   cumulative effect inhibiting plant growth. Chemical names used:
   2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D); 2-(2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxy)

Abstract = {{Endoscopic incision has become a common treatment for ureteropelvic
   junction (UPJ) obstruction, Recent reports have indicated the importance
   of crossing vessels in the success of endopyelotomy. Endoluminal
   ultrasound can define the location and size of adjacent vessels, and the
   effect of these vessels and their location on the success of
   endopyelotomy can be determined, A group of 28 patients found to have
   UPJ obstruction on excretory urography, retrograde ureteropyelography,
   radiographic nuclear scan, and clinical presentation were evaluated by
   endoluminal ultrasound at the time of endopyelotomy, which was performed
   by percutaneous nephroscopy or retrograde ureteroscopy. All patients had
   an indwelling ureteral stent postoperatively. Follow-up evaluation
   included renal ultrasound and nuclear scans. Excretory urography was
   performed in several patients, In this preliminary study, the success
   rate was lower in patients with vessels in a lateral position at the
   UPJ. The endoscopic approach did not alter the success rate. These
   factors should be considered in treating primary UPJ obstruction with
   endoluminal incision.}},

Abstract = {{A slow phase of bronchial and bronchiolar clearance ('airway retention')
   has been included in the revised dosimetric model for the human
   respiratory tract recently adopted by the International Commission on
   Radiological Protection (ICRP), based primarily on the results of the
   bolus clearance experiments conducted by Stahlhofen et al. The treatment
   of airway retention in the new ICRP model is described An analysis was
   carried out of the sensitivity of the equivalent lung dose, and the
   effective dose, to assumptions made in the new model about the extent of
   airway retention. It was shown that inclusion of airway retention of
   material deposited in the bronchial tree does have a significant effect
   on both end-points (of the order of 10-50\%) for a wide range of
   radionuclides. In some cases, notably moderately soluble forms of
   long-lived alpha-emitters, its inclusion increases these doses by up to
   a factor of three, so that it makes the dominant contribution to the
   calculated dose. The model assumes that material in transit through the
   bronchial tree, having initially deposited in the alveolar region, is
   not subject to airway retention. Including retention of this material
   would typically increase doses by a further factor similar to that
   resulting from the airway retention of the bronchial deposit.}},

   endoperoxide synthase and soybean lipoxygenase has been investigated by
   using steady-state initial rate measurements, The rate of product
   formation (conjugated diene hydroperoxy and hydroxy derivatives) was
   followed spectrophotometrically at 235 nm, and the rate of oxygen
   consumption was measured polarographically. The ratio of the two rates,
   d{[}conjugated diene]/-d{[}O-2], is 2/1 for the prostaglandin
   endoperoxide synthase catalyzed reaction and 1/1 for the lipoxygenase
   reaction, The 2/1 ratio can be explained by two interrelated routes,
   each of which results in formation of the conjugated diene hydroxy
   derivative of the acid, One route, initiated by hydrogen atom
   abstraction from the acid by Compound I, results in formation of the
   conjugated diene hydroperoxy derivative, The latter is converted to the
   hydroxy derivative by regenerating Compound I from the native enzyme,
   The other route involves direct oxygen atom insertion into the acid by
   the tyrosyl radical form of Compound I, The decrease in absorbance at
   235 nm obtained in the presteady-state phase suggests that during the
   initial contact of hydroperoxide and enzyme an epoxy-hydroxy fatty
   acid-enzyme complex may be formed.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge about land conservation exists along a spatial continuum,
   represented at the broadest level (with least depth) by
   international-level experts who have international-level expertise, and
   at the narrowest level (with most depth) by the individual farmer with
   the most site-specific knowledge at the plot level. This continuum
   covers many different aspects of knowledge about land degradation and
   its amelioration, including technical and cultural knowledge. This paper
   reports an effort (one in a series of steps) to gather, formalize,
   codify, and operationalize knowledge about land conservation from two
   different levels of the continuum. Land conservation knowledge was
   elicited from farmers and extension agents in Vilathikulam taluk (an
   area of contiguous villages) in Tamil Nadu, southeastern India, using
   semi-structured interviews. The knowledge thus gained was combined with
   knowledge from the literature on soils and land conservation for the
   area. This information was organized into factual knowledge and process
   knowledge, and implemented in the form of general recommendations,
   constraints, and specific recommendations. The process of arriving at
   these categories was organized into several steps using a spatial anchor
   and soil type as keys. These were operationalized in a rule-based
   computer program (LAnd CONservation EXpert-LACONEX), which offers land
   conservation advice at the plot level for Vilathikulam taluk, using an

Abstract = {{Changes in motor cortex excitability induced by somatosensory afferences
   were evaluated in 5 subjects by testing how the short-latency
   cortico-spinal effects evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation in
   flexor carpi radialis (FCR) motoneurones were influenced by volleys in
   median nerve afferent fibres. Transcranial magnetic stimulation induced
   two facilitatory peaks on FCR H reflex, the first at a conditioning-test
   interval of about -3 msec and the second at 0 msec, separated by a phase
   of inhibition. If an electric shock to the median nerve at the wrist,
   0.8-1 x motor threshold (MT) for thenar muscles, preceded the cortical
   stimulus by 18-25 msec, an increase in size of both facilitatory peaks
   was observed. The increase was partly due to a direct action of the
   median nerve volley on motoneurones. When this contribution was
   subtracted, two peaks of additional facilitation resulted as the effect
   of combined conditioning. Additional facilitation was present even
   during the short-lasting phase ascribed to monosynaptic cortico-spinal
   excitation of motoneurones, i.e., the first millisecond of the earliest
   facilitatory peak. This result indicates that cortical responsiveness to
   magnetic stimulation had been enhanced by the peripheral stimulus. The
   lime course of the excitability changes in motor cortex was compared
   with the cortical somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) induced by the
   same peripheral stimulus. Additional facilitation was present
   immediately after the N20 peak of SEPs and lasted 8-10 msec. Additional
   facilitation had the same threshold as N20 (0.6 x MT) and grew in
   parallel with it when grading the afferent stimulus up to 1 MT.}},

Abstract = {{This paper represents an attempt to understand, from basic principles,
   the origins of hysteresis during variant rearrangement. As a framework
   for this study, we focus on the biaxial loading experiments conducted in
   {[}7] on single crystals of gamma'(1) martensite, oriented so that two
   compound twinned variants of martensite have least energy. Our analysis
   supports the idea that hysteresis (at least in these slow cyclic
   experiments) is due to metastability: as the loads are changed, the
   current state goes from stable to metastable to unstable. The idea we
   explore is that the metastability is essentially caused by geometric
   incompatibility. That is, even though there is a state of lower energy
   than the metastable state, it is necessarily geometrically incompatible
   with it, and this gives rise to an energy barrier. We show that this
   concept of metastability (based on calculating relative minimizers of
   energy) has a close relation with the Schmid Law and reveals an
   interesting dependence on the shape of the specimen. Further details and
   background for the, ideas presented here can be found in {[}4],
   forthcoming.}},

Abstract = {{Capillary zone electrophoresis was used for the determination of
   gold(III) chloride using direct UV detection at 220 nm. By using a
   capillary column 70 cm long, the optimum applied voltage was found to be
   around -7 kV; carrier solution containing 0.1 M HCl and 0.4 M NaCl was
   used as an additive. At this pH, the electroosmotic flow-rate appears to
   be almost zero. The effects of chloride concentration and the applied
   voltage on determination efficiency are discussed. Heat generation
   appeared negligible as the electric current and migration time were
   reproducible. The analytical performance is discussed in terms of the
   detection limit, linearity and reproducibility. A single trial was
   performed in 18 min. Under these conditions, Pd(II) and Pt(IV) can also
   be determined; the order of mobility in the electropherogram was as
   follows: PdCl42- > PtCl62- > AuCl4-. The method was applied to the
   monitoring of Au concentration during a study of AuCl4- transport
   through solid-supported liquid membranes.}},

Abstract = {{Intracellular recording from lumbar motoneurons of the neonatal rat
   spinal cord in vitro was used to study how recently developed
   non-peptide antagonists such as SR-140333 and SR-48698, known to block
   distinct subtypes of tachykinin receptors peripherally, might affect
   synaptic transmission elicited by electrical stimulation of dorsal root
   fibres. SR-140333 (1 mu M) preferentially antagonized responses mediated
   by an exogenously applied agonist acting on the NK1 receptor subclass,
   while SR-48968 (0.5 mu M) preferentially reduced responses mediated by
   an exogenously applied agonist acting on the NK2 receptor subclass.
   SR-48968 did not affect fast or slow excitatory postsynaptic potentials
   (EPSPs) or `wind-up' responses induced by repetitive, low-frequency
   stimulation (mimicking certain types of nociceptive input); binding
   studies using this radiolabelled ligand disclosed specific binding
   activity (21 fmol/mg protein) selectively displaced by an NK2 receptor
   agonist. SR-140333 reduced the late component of fast and slow EPSPs,
   and of wind-up. Pharmacological block of ionotropic glutamate receptors
   abolished all dorsal root-evoked EPSPs. In comparison to glutamate
   receptor blockers, SR-140333 was a weaker antagonist of slow synaptic
   responses, though it displayed preferential antagonism towards some
   components of the wind-up phenomenon. The present results provide
   evidence obtained with a novel NK1 antagonist that a neuropeptide
   (presumably substance P), although not directly released by primary
   afferents onto motoneurons, is a neurotransmitter (acting via NK1
   receptors) in the pathway mediating slow synaptic responses of
   motoneurons, and is presumably involved in signalling nociceptive inputs
   from the periphery.}},

   district, Utah: Relation to associated iron deposits}},

Abstract = {{The Iron Springs mining district of southwestern Utah contains the
   largest iron deposits in the western United States. These are related to
   emplacement, at minimum depths of 1 to 2.3 km, of three Miocene
   laccoliths of porphyritic quartz monzonite. When emplaced, the magma was
   neatly half crystallized, on the verge of brittle behavior, and
   contained phenocrysts of plagioclase, amphibole, biotite, and
   clinopyroxene. Granophyric dikes in quartz monzonite formed from
   residual liquid, but miarolitic cavities in these dikes are lined with
   alpha quartz, indicating that deposition continued from a volatile-rich
   phase below the solidus. Pervasive high-temperature alteration led to:
   replacement of augite by diopside; oxidation of magnetite and ilmenite;
   replacement of amphibole (completely) and biotite (partially) by
   aggregates of diopside, alkali feldspars, smectite-chlorite, magnetite,
   ilmenite, and calcite; albitization of groundmass alkali feldspar; ex
   change of Mg for Fe and of F for OH in biotite; and exchange of F and OH
   for Cl in apatite. This alteration produced whole-rock enrichment in
   Fe3+, Na, and H2O, and losses in Fe2+, Ca, and K. Total Fe was
   effectively unchanged.
   A chilled, relatively impermeable margin, surrounding the pervasively
   altered interior of each laccolith, was mechanically bonded to wall rock
   more strongly than to the magmatic interior, and deformed with the wall
   rock during subsequent intrusion and structural readjustment. In this
   peripheral shell, clinopyroxene, amphibole, and biotite were less
   altered.
   Where the roof of each laccolith had a radius of curvature of less than
   2 km, a heterogeneous jointed zone formed below the peripheral shell. In
   this zone, pervasively altered quartz monzonite was fractured by renewed
   intrusion or by structural readjustment of roof rocks. Along the
   resulting joints, quartz monzonite was altered to bleached zones
   (selvages) during a second stage of alteration. Within these selvages,
   complete decomposition of biotite that had survived pervasive alteration
   was accompanied by further growth of diopside, albitization of
   feldspars, and dissolution of some apatite. Unlike early pervasive
   alteration, selvage alteration was fracture controlled and caused strong
   whole-rock depletion in light REE, total Fe, Mg, P, Rb, Y, Pa, and H2O-,
   but caused enrichment in Na. Magnetite-apatite veins commonly formed
   along the joints.
   Adjacent to zones of selvage joints, strata-bound orebodies of
   magnetite, hematite, and apatite formed in limestone around the three
   laccoliths. Iron-bearing fluid was derived by subsolidus alteration from
   quartz monzonite; there is no evidence supporting immiscible separation
   of iron-oxide-rich liquid from silicate magma. Mass balance calculations
   indicate that the Fe, P, Si, Al, and Mg in the orebodies could have been
   entirely supplied by selvage alteration of 40 km(3) of quartz monzonite,
   in agreement with the exposed and confidently inferred volume of altered
   intrusive rock.
   A fourth pluton, lacking magnetite veins, orebodies, and selvages, was
   emplaced closer to the surface and against sandstone and shale rather
   than limestone. Iron liberated from hydrous mafic phenocrysts in this
   body was oxidized in place, forming disseminated hematite.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate a dental adhesive system that uses a single

   enamel and dentin bonding sites were prepared to 600 grit on human molar
   teeth. The Clearfil Liner Bond 2 adhesive system was used to bond
   Clearfil AP-X composite to both enamel and dentin. After 24 hours of
   water storage, shear bond strengths were determined using an Instron
   testing machine. Fifty V-shaped cavity preparations were prepared in
   human molar teeth with an enamel and cementum margin. Composite
   restorations were placed using the new adhesive system. The teeth were
   stored for 24 hours, thermocycled, stained with AgNO3, sectioned and
   examined for microleakage. SEM examinations were also completed to
   evaluate the effects of the treatment steps on enamel and dentin
   surfaces. Results: Mean shear bond strengths for the experimental
   adhesive to enamel and dentin were 28.2 +/- 4.9 and 19.4 +/- 3.1 MPa. A
   t-test revealed that the enamel bond strength was significantly greater
   (P < 0.05) than the dentin strength. No marginal leakage was observed
   from the enamel margins of the restorations. Three restorations showed
   minimal leakage from the cementum margins. SEM examinations showed resin
   penetration into both the conditioned enamel and dentin surfaces. The
   adhesive system produced high bond strengths to both enamel and dentin,
   exhibited very minimal microleakage and was easy to use.}},

Abstract = {{We report the discovery of a new highly magnetic DA white dwarf, RE
   J0317 - 853, through its detection as an EUV source by the ROSAT Wide
   Field Camera. A combination of far-UV and optical spectra indicates that
   the star has an effective temperature approximate to 50 000 K, making it
   the hottest known white dwarf with a measurable magnetic field.
   Furthermore, the magnetic field is exceptionally intense, having a value
   approximate to 340 MG, sufficient to shift and broaden the Balmer line
   features almost beyond recognition. A field of this value is also among
   the highest known. While these parameters already make this star unique,
   we have also found that, alone among the magnetic DA white dwarfs, it is
   a large-amplitude (approximate to +/- 0.1 mag) oscillator at optical
   wavelengths with a period of 725.4 s. Since there is no known
   pulsational instability strip in this temperature range, the most
   plausible explanation is that the modulation of the optical flux is due
   to rotation of the star. If the star is at the same distance as another
   DA star, some 16 arcsec away, it must have an unusually small radius
   and, consequently, a mass approaching the Chandrasekhar limit. The two
   stars would also comprise one of only three known visual double
   degenerate systems with hot white dwarf components. ROSAT data indicate
   that heavy elements detected in the IUE spectrum are mainly attributable
   to circumstellar material, and we suggest this may arise from a wind
   driven by cyclotron radiation pressure from the intense magnetic field.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{PURPOSE: tron overload unexplained by dietary or medicinal iron excess,
   transfusion, or sideroblastic anemia has been described infrequently in
   Americans of African descent. The purpose of this study was to
   characterize iron overload attributable to excessive iron absorption in
   African Americans.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: in a community hematology and medical oncology
   practice during the interval 1990 to 1993, we identified and evaluated a
   series of cases comprised of 6 men and 1 woman, with a mean age of 55
   +/- 14 (SD) years (range 33 to 69). Data on clinical features', serum
   iron parameters, liver and body iron stores, evaluations of anemia,
   human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing, and family studies were analyzed.
   RESULTS: Among our patients, the serum iron parameters were: iron
   concentration 26 +/- 13 mu mol/L, transferrin saturation 59 +/- 21\%,
   and ferritin concentration 1,588 +/- 1,053 mu g/L. Clinical
   abnormalities observed included weakness and fatigue, decreased libido
   and impotence, hepatopathy, arthropathy, diabetes mellitus,
   hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, and hyperpigmentation. Hepatic
   parenchymal cell iron deposits were increased in each of the 6 patients
   studied, and Kupffer cell iron deposits were prominent in 4. The
   occurrence of iron overload was verified by liver iron quantification
   and therapeutic phlebotomy. Four subjects had alpha-thalassemia minor; 2
   others had hemoglobin S and C traits. No proband had HLA-A3 positivity.
   Four probands had other family members with iron overload.
   CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with Caucasians with hemochromatosis, our
   patients have slightly lower mean values of serum iron concentration and
   transferrin saturation, more Kupffer cell iron deposits, a higher
   incidence of thalassemia and hemoglobinopathy, and infrequent positivity
   for HLA-A3. Iron overload in African Americans appears to be more
   similar to that in certain sub-Saharan African natives than to
   hemochromatosis.}},

Abstract = {{Direct losses of ions trapped in the toroidal field ripple of Tore Supra
   were studied, using two techniques. The first (DRIPPLE I) correlates the
   ion loss current measured by an electric probe with the ion loss power
   measured by a calorimeter. As the calorimeter integrates over all
   particle energies and time, it yields only the averaged lost ion energy.
   The second technique (DRIPPLE II), still under development, uses a
   Faraday cup positioned and filtered so as to select ions by their Larmor
   radius. Preliminary results are useful but the currents measured are
   small (1-100 nA), and improvements in instrumentation are needed to take
   full advantage of the data. During ICRH (hydrogen minority regime,
   resonance on-axis), a direct correlation between the lost ion mean
   energy and the density of hydrogen (n(H)) is observed. The energy
   increases when the hydrogen minority density decreases. Moreover, the
   line integrated density and the lower hybrid (LH) heating also affect
   the fast ion losses.}},

Abstract = {{In a long-term evaluation of the injection of treated wastewater into an
   alluvial aquifer near El Paso, TX, the boron (B) concentration and B
   stable isotopic values were investigated as potential intrinsic tracers
   of recharge-water source. The B stable isotopic values (delta(11)B) of
   background groundwater (14 parts per thousand) and water from
   anthropogenic sources such as treated municipal wastewater (6-10 parts
   per thousand) and irrigation-affected water (> 40 parts per thousand)
   were distinctly different. The B concentrations in combination with the
   B stable isotope values distinguished these water types and natural
   saline water as sources of recharge to groundwater. Boron is suited for
   use as a conservative tracer in groundwater because of its high
   solubility in aqueous solution (predominantly as boric acid), its
   natural presence in nearly all water, and the lack of effects by
   evaporation or volatilization, by oxidation-reduction reactions, or by
   mineral precipitation or dissolution in all but extremely saline waters.
   The variability of any observed isotopic ratio in groundwater can be
   from several processes, such as variability in the B source, mixing, and
   partitioning reactions, including sorption, which cause isotopic
   fractionation. For rocks and minerals, a range in delta(11)B values of
   more than 70 parts per thousand has been reported. Water sources sampled
   to date have a similarly broad range. In this injection test, B
   concentrations in all samples were below 1 mg/l, and differences between
   individual sources of salinity were indistinct based on analytical
   concentration alone. In contrast, a hypothetical, nonlinear mixture
   between solutions with different delta(11)B values and different B
   concentrations demonstrated a detectable isotopic shift for smalt volume
   percent contributions of the source water with the largest boron
   concentration. The Hueco Bolson aquifer at the injection site is
   geologically heterogeneous, and the cost to establish a sufficient
   density of monitoring wells to describe the flow of injected water in
   groundwater is prohibitive. For this and other sites, chemical and
   isotopic tracers such as B and delta(11)B may be used to identify the
   influence of various water sources with potentially adverse
   environmental consequences.}},

Abstract = {{Platelet volume is a measure of platelet function, An increased platelet
   volume is found in acute vascular syndromes and may have a causative
   role and predict outcome, Patients with autosomal dominant polycystic
   kidney disease (APKD) are at increased risk of developing, and dying
   from, premature vascular disease, We hypothesized that platelet volume
   might be altered in patients with APKD, Platelet volume was measured in
   16 normotensive APKD patients with normal renal function and 16 normal
   volunteers pair-matched for age, gender, race and body mass index.
   Mean platelet volume was increased by 0.4 fl (95\% confidence limits 0.1
   to 0.9, 2P = 0.017) in patients with APKD as compared with normal
   subjects: median 8.4 fl (0.7) versus 8.0 fl (0.3) respectively, In
   contrast, platelet count was lower by 63 x 10(9)/l (-5 to -108, 2P =
   0.031): 225 (40) x 10(9)/l versus 280 (35) x 10(9)/l while the platelet
   mass was not different, -0.36 ml/l (-0.81 to 0.02, 2P = 0.070): 1.82
   (0.30) ml/l versus 2.28 (0.38) ml/l, Platelet volume and count were
   inversely correlated across the two groups, r(s) = -0.342 (2P = 0.055),
   Serum levels of erythropoietin, a hormone that contributes to the
   regulation of thrombopoeisis, were not different between the APKD
   patients and normal controls, 35 U/l (-71 to 120, 2P = 0.42): 107 U/l
   (53) versus 84 U/l (57), Although erythropoietin did not correlate with
   platelet volume, r(s) = -0.185 (2P = 0.36), it was positively associated
   with platelet count, r(s) = 0.465 (2P = 0.029) and platelet mass, r(s) =
   0.466 (2P = 0.028).
   Since an increased platelet volume is associated with platelet
   hyperactivity, the increased platelet volume in APKD may be a marker, or
   even contribute to the development, of premature vascular disease and
   sudden cardiac death in patients with APKD.}},

Abstract = {{Thrombolysis offers several advantages over surgery in the treatment of
   thrombosed dialysis access grafts, This study was undertaken to compare
   the results obtained when thrombolysis was used as the preferred
   treatment (Thrombolysis Period) for this problem in comparison with the
   results that had been obtained when surgical therapy had been the
   preferred treatment (Surgery Period), Each period of study lasted 12
   months and the two periods ran consecutively, All data were collected
   prospectively. No significant problems were encountered when
   thrombolysis was substituted for surgical therapy as the preferred
   treatment of thrombosed dialysis access grafts, During the Surgical
   Period there were 580 thrombotic episodes, a rate of 0.86 per patient,
   During the Thrombolysis Period there were 568 episodes, a rate of 0.76,
   These differences were not statistically significant, During the
   Thrombolysis Period, thrombolysis was found to be as effective as
   surgery had been during the Surgical Period in the initial treatment of
   thrombosed grafts, The rate of surgical revision was decreased by
   two-thirds during the Thrombolysis Period, but the rate of graft
   replacement was not altered, Long-term patency after therapy by
   thrombolysis during the Thrombolysis Period was superior to that for
   surgical thrombectomy performed during the Surgical Period, and was
   equal to that for revision and graft replacement, The complication rate
   for thrombolysis was low and complications were managed easily without
   sequelae, It is concluded that thrombolysis is safe and, when used as
   the preferred treatment for thrombosed dialysis access grafts, is as
   effective as surgical therapy, Since it preserves potential vascular
   access sites and yields long-term patency rates superior to those for
   surgical thrombectomy, it should be regarded as the treatment of choice
   for this problem.}},

Abstract = {{An abnormal degree of attention to one's body shape has been implicated
   in the development and maintenance of eating pathology. This article
   reports on three preliminary reliability and validity studies of the
   Attention to Body Shape Scale (ABS). Although brief, the ABS was found
   to be internally consistent and relatively stable over 2 weeks for both
   women and men. As expected, women were more body-focused on the ABS than
   were men. Preliminary validation studies on college women had
   encouraging results. Lending evidence of convergent validity, the ABS
   correlated with measures of eating pathology and dietary restraint.
   Moreover, although the ABS correlated with a measure of
   general-appearance orientation, regression analyses showed that the
   former was more closely linked than the latter to eating pathology. As
   evidence of discriminant validity, the ABS failed to correlate with
   dysphoria, body weight, or the tendency to eat in response to emotional
   or environmental pressures. As predicted by theory, high scores on the
   ABS were associated with body-image distortion. However, contrary to
   predictions, the ABS failed to moderate the impact of induced anxiety on
   body image on two of three measures. The implications of these findings
   and suggestions for future work are discussed.}},

   the MAGIC model. The model outputs were compared with measured
   responses. Over the wide span in site conditions among the three sites
   MAGIC successfully reproduced the observed effects in the `clean rain'
   treatments. Seasalt influence caused single year discrepancies but the
   long term trends were well reproduced. in particular the significant
   decreases in SO4 output were well reproduced. A simultaneous change in
   base cation leaching was observed, which in the long run will be the
   basis for the recovery of these acidified systems. The rate of recovery
   at the 3 studied sites was very slow.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive ethology, a relatively new interdisciplinary and integrative
   science, is under attack with respect to its scientific status. However,
   there also are strong supporters of research in this area. In this paper
   I consider (1) some of the topics in which cognitive ethologists are
   interested, (2) possible connections between cognitive analyses of
   social behavior and philosophical concepts including intentionality and
   representation, (3) recent work on vigilance or scanning behavior in
   highly social birds, Evening Grosbeaks (Coccothraustes uespertinus),
   that benefits from taking a cognitive perspective, and (4) what may be
   gained by taking a cognitive approach to the study of social behavior
   and what may be lost by not doing so. My study of vigilance indicates
   that the way in which individuals are positioned with respect to one
   another influences their behavior, and that when a flock contains four
   or more birds there are large changes in scanning and other patterns of
   behavior that may be related to how grosbeaks attempt to gather
   information about other flock members. When birds are arranged in a
   circular array so that they can see one another easily compared to when
   they are arranged in a line that makes visual monitoring of flock
   members more difficult, birds who have difficulty seeing one another are
   (i) more vigilant, (ii) change their head and body positions more often,
   (iii) react to changes in group size more slowly, (iv) show less
   coordination in head movements, and (v) show more variability in all
   measures. These differences in behavior argue against the pooling of
   data collected on individuals feeding in different geometric arrays. The
   variations in behavior also may say something about if and how
   individuals attempt visually to represent their group to themselves-how
   they form, store, and use records of the behavior of others to inform
   their own future behavior.}},

Abstract = {{We show that the Bergman, Szego, and Poisson kernels associated to an
   n-connected domain in the plane are not genuine functions of two complex
   variables. Rather, they are all given by elementary rational
   combinations of n + 1 holomorphic functions of one complex variable and
   their conjugates. Moreover, adl three kernel functions are composed of
   the same basic n + 1 functions. Our results can be interpreted as saying
   that the kernel functions are simpler than one might expect. We also
   prove, however, that the kernels cannot be too simple by showing that
   the only finitely connected domains in the plane whose Bergman or
   Poisson kernels are rational functions are the simply connected domains
   which can be mapped onto the unit disc by a rational biholomorphic
   mapping. This leads to a proof that the classical Green's function
   associated to a finitely connected domain in the plane is one half the
   logarithm of a real valued rational function if and only if the domain
   is simply connected and there is a rational biholomorphic map of the
   domain onto the unit disc. We also characterize those domains in the

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE Increased levels of free thyroid hormones have been previously
   described in prepubertal blind subjects and have been thought to be a
   consequence of a partial target organ refractoriness due to the early
   and prolonged lack of light perception. The aim of this study was to
   clarify whether this abnormality is permanent or transient and the
   interrelationships between melatonin and thyroid hormone secretion.
   MEASUREMENTS Total and free thyroid hormones, TSH, thyroxine-binding
   globulin (TBG), reverse triiodothyronine (rT3) and melatonin were
   measured in plasma samples obtained at 0800 h (two hours after
   lights-on) in a group of 11 totally (group 1) and 16 partially (group 2)
   blind adult patients and in 10 age-matched healthy subjects.
   RESULTS Both totally and partially blind patients showed melatonin
   levels higher than in controls (330 +/- 106 pmol/l, group 1 and 361 +/-
   159 pmol/l, group 2, respectively; controls: 53 +/- 12 pmol/l, P < 0.001
   vs both groups), but fT4, fT3, T4, T3 TSH, rT3 and TBG concentrations
   showed no significant differences from controls.
   CONCLUSIONS A possible resetting of pituitary-thyroid axis regulation
   can occur in blindness after puberty; variations of melatonin secretion
   could play a role in this. The inhibitory effect of melatonin on thyroid
   gland function found in animals does not seem to occur in humans.
   Elevated melatonin levels, both in patients with total blindness and in
   those with light perception only, suggest that more complex mechanisms
   other than light signalling are involved in the changes of melatonin
   secretion in blindness.}},

Abstract = {{An alternative process scheme for dry local oxidation is presented. It
   has several advantages when compared with the conventional wet process.
   For example, dry local oxidation of silicon reduces the bird's beak

   submicrometre mask openings. Furthermore, it avoids detrimental gate
   oxide thinning and reduces the complexity of the process, because it can
   be performed at the same time as the well drive-in (DW-LOCOS).
   Preliminary results demonstrate that there is no degradation in the
   electrical characteristics of diodes and MOS capacitor test structures,
   thus permitting DW-LOCOS to be advantageously incorporated into
   CMOS-VLSI processing sequences.}},

   heteroarylmethanethiols (including 2-furyl-, 2-thienyl-, and

   investigated in benzene solution both at 100 degrees C in the presence
   of AIBN and at room temperature in the presence of BEt(3)/O-2. Under
   both of these conditions the above thiols generally furnished transient
   2-sulfanylvinyl radicals through regioselective addition of
   corresponding sulfanyl radicals to the terminal alkyne carbon, but
   2-benzo{[}b]furanthiol failed to react with either alkyne in the

   2-(ethylsulfanyl)benzo{[}b]furan to a significant extent. The produced
   2-(2-heteroarylsulfanyl) vinyl radicals largely preferred to undergo
   intermolecular H-abstraction reaction rather than intramolecular 5-endo
   cyclization onto the heteroaryl moiety of the 2-sulfanyl substituent.
   The 2-{[}(2-thienylmethyl)sulfanyl]- and, especially,
   2-{[}(2-furylmethyl)sulfanyl]vinyl radicals, besides H-abstraction,
   promptly underwent intramolecular B-exo cyclization to give spiro
   radicals that interestingly underwent beta-scission of their respective
   C-S and C-O bond resulting in ring cleavage of the original heteroaryl
   group. The 2-{[}(3-thienylmethyl)sulfanyl]vinyl radicals did not exhibit
   any similar B-exo cyclization, but did undergo a 6-endo cyclization to a

Abstract = {{Control of preemergence damping-off caused by Phytophthora parasitica
   Dastur was investigated on three bedding plant species in a 1 peat : 1
   vermiculite medium (v/v) limed at 3 kg . m(-3) and drenched with
   aluminum at 10, 25, or 50 meg Al/100 cm(3) medium. Aluminum as
   Al-2(SO4)(3) was applied as a drench at 0.75, 1.9, or 3.75 g/150 mi
   water to the surface of infested medium in 650-cm(2) plug trays
   (1300-cm(3) tray volume). All concentrations of aluminum were effective
   in controlling preemergence damping-off of snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus
   L.) and vinca (Catharanthus roseus G. Don, Madagascar periwinkle), but
   only 50 meg Al+3/100 cm(3) medium was effective for petunia (Petunia x
   hybrida Hort. Vilm.-Andr.). At 4 days after seeding and drenching with
   aluminum sulfate, exchangeable aluminum was 0, 0.5, and 2.03 meg
   Al+3/100 g medium, respectively, for the three concentrations used.
   Control of damping-off of snapdragon and vinca with 10 meg Al+3/100
   cm(3) medium with no detectable exchangeable aluminum 4 days after
   application suggests that P. parasitica was suppressed by aluminum early
   in the host-pathogen interaction, whereas petunia was susceptible to
   damping-off for a longer period before seedling emergence. Aluminum was
   not phytotoxic to vinca, snapdragon, or petunia grown in a limed medium.}},

Abstract = {{Observations from pediatric epidemiology studies over the past 20 years
   document that atherosclerosis and essential hypertension begin in
   childhood. Evidence of coronary artery disease and hypertensive
   cardiovascular renal disease is found and relates strongly to clinical
   cardiovascular risk factors. Obesity, especially central obesity, and
   hyperinsulinemia are commonly found, and these cluster with other risk
   factors, Lifestyles, such as poor eating behavior and tobacco usage,
   also begin early and influence cardiovascular risk, The implication from
   these pediatric observations is that intervention should begin early to
   prevent unhealthy lifestyles and encourage adoption of healthy
   behaviors, Where adult heart diseases pervade the major part of the
   United States population and other industrialized cultures, various
   epidemiologic strategies of prevention are needed, A high-risk, clinical
   approach can be applied to individuals with heart disease or to
   individuals with underlying risk factors and their families. Primary and
   secondary prevention are both important and should be implemented by
   primary care physicians, A population approach is also needed because of
   the widespread occurrence of heart disease. A public health approach to
   prevention can occur through health education and health promotion
   programs. Physicians should play a role in encouraging prevention for
   the general population. The future direction of Preventive Cardiology
   for our nation rests on educating children to adopt and maintain healthy
   lifestyles, The Bogalusa Heart Study has made a major contribution in
   providing the background information for that direction.}},

Abstract = {{Abscess formation at the site of drug injection is the commonest
   infectious complication in drug addicts. This study characterizes the
   clinical presentation of the condition, its current microbiology, and
   treatment outcome. All patients presenting for treatment of soft tissue
   abscesses associated with parenteral drug abuse over a 21-month period
   were studied. Sixty-six patients with 70 subcutaneous abscesses after
   injection of cocaine (85\%), heroin (5\%), or unreported drugs (10\%)
   were identified. Only 42\% were febrile (T > 37.5 degrees C), 54 percent
   had leukocytosis, and 47 percent had wound fluctuance. Wound cultures
   (243 isolates in 57 patients) grew predominately anaerobes (143
   isolates) and facultative gram-positive cocci (88 isolates). Twenty-six
   blood cultures were obtained, and five (19\%) were positive, two with
   the same bacteria isolated from the wound. Of the patients tested, 29
   percent were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen and 9 percent for
   HIV. Simple incision and drainage was effective in all cases. Classical
   signs and symptoms of infection and abscess formation may be absent in
   this patient population. Many of these patients carry other blood-borne
   infections which the health professional must guard against. Cocaine
   injection, and `'mixed'' aerobic-anaerobic infections predominated, in
   contrast to earlier reports, when narcotics and aerobes predominated.
   Simple incision and drainage is adequate treatment; antibiotics, when
   given, should cover gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria; gram-negative
   coverage is unnecessary.}},

   with a mechanism in which 7-M (NI = Cr, W) undergoes a rapid, reversible
   deprotonation of the alpha-carbon to form 7-M-, followed by
   rate-limiting reaction of 7-M(-) with water, H3O+, or buffer acids. This
   latter step most likely involves protonation of the carbene carbon
   concerted with cleavage of the C-Cr bond. The hydrolysis of both 7-Cr
   and 7-M is strongly accelerated by light; a limited study of this
   photochemical pathway at high pH, which also leads to
   beta-methoxystyrene as the principal organic product, suggests a

Journal = {{THYROID}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{443-447}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In some patients with severe hypothyroidism thyroxine replacement
   therapy precipitates or aggravates angina pectoris, whereas in other
   patients angina pectoris is ameliorated or even disappears, The reason
   for this paradox is unknown, It has been attributed either to reversible
   endocrine cardiomyopathy in the form of asymmetric septal hypertrophy
   (ASH) or reversible anatomical narrowing of the coronary arteries, The
   results of a recent investigation, in which myocardial performance was
   surveyed by radionuclide ventriculography throughout early thyroxine
   replacement therapy in severe hypothyroidism, were compatible with the
   presence of reversible coronary dysfunction rather than of ASH. The aim
   of the present investigation was to confirm these findings. In six
   severely hypothyroid patients, without echocardiographic evidence of ASH
   or evidence of concomitant coronary artery disease (CAD), exercise and
   redistribution tomographic myocardial thallium-201 imaging (SPECT) was
   performed before thyroxine replacement therapy and repeated after 10
   days and again after 2 months during therapy, In four patients
   substantial regional perfusion defects were demonstrated after exercise
   that were normalized at rest both before, and in one subject also after
   10 days, on thyroxine, With restoration of euthyroidism, exercise and
   redistribution SPECT were normal in every patient, Determination of
   exact confidence limits reveals that the proportional incidence of
   myocardial perfusion defects in hypothyroidism, indicating hemicardia
   ischemia, will at least be 22\% with 95\% probability, Despite the
   relatively low specificity of SPECT it seems pertinent to conclude that
   impaired myocardial perfusion as assessed by SPECT probably is due to
   reversible coronary dysfunction inherent in the hypothyroid state, and
   that this is not an infrequent manifestation of severe hypothyroidism.}},

Abstract = {{Acid groundwater can corrode plumbing systems and solubilize metals in
   the soil or in the plumbing systems. Since the soluble forms of some
   metals are toxic, concerns regarding the effects of groundwater
   acidification on human health have been raised. A number of new methods
   for treating acidified groundwater have been developed and tested during
   the last decade. In addition conventional filter devices have been
   tested and evaluated. Seven methods of in situ alkalization, i.e.
   treatment of the soil around the well with an alkalizer, have been
   tested for 1-8 years. These methods involve the application of limestone
   or slaked lime in the recharge area of the well or in/near the well.
   Target values set for the tests were: pH>6,5 and alkalinity >60 mg/l.
   Almost all of these methods have]ed to improvements in water quality,
   but in some cases target values were not reached. Most of the treatments
   have resulted in significant reductions in iron and aluminium contents
   in drinking water. Eight types of more conventional devices for
   processing acidified well water have been tested for a couple of years.
   These de-acidification filters are installed indoors or in some cases
   inside the well. The majority of them performed well, providing
   acceptable values of pH and alkalinity under normal water flows.
   However,after periods of more intense water flushing, some of the
   filters showed a decreased capacity to neutralize the water. Inexpensive
   types of equipment, e.g. some of the filters placed inside the well,
   performed just as well as the more expensive types.}},

   1 (''feel fine'') to 5 (''intermittent vomiting, with or without
   nausea''). Results: Five subjects with motion sickness initially

   improvement (3.6 +/- 0.6 to 3.4 +/- 1.1)(mean, +/- SD), whereas the

   the P6 position, symptoms improved in each subject (3.4 +/- 1.1 to 1.0
   +/- 0.7)(p < 0.01). Conclusions: Motion sickness symptoms were
   suppressed by portable acustimulation in field studies of seasickness.

Abstract = {{Drainage of the continuous phase plays an important role in the collapse
   of foams and concentrated liquid-liquid emulsions. A general model for
   the drainage in initially homogeneous (uniform volume fraction of each
   phase) foams and concentrated emulsions is presented. Separation of the
   dispersed phase is accounted for by considering the collapse of films in
   the upper part of the system. Expressions for the movement of the two
   boundaries (emulsion/continuous phase and emulsion/dispersed phase) are
   formulated as a function of the velocity of the continuous phase fluid.
   The model successfully predicts the trend of drainage lag times observed
   in initially homogeneous foams. Phase behavior based on a drainage
   equilibrium, which implies a balance between the opposing effects of
   gravity and the plateau border suction gradient, is investigated. There
   are three possibilities: separation of a single phase (continuous or
   dispersed), separation of both phases, and no phase separation. It is
   shown that the phase behavior depends oh a single dimensionless group
   which is a measure of the relative magnitudes of the gravitational and
   capillary forces. A generalized `'phase'' diagram is presented which can
   be used to determine the phase behavior. It is shown that separation of
   both phases occurs only if the column length exceeds a critical value.}},

Abstract = {{Low microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) activity is associated with an
   increased risk of a teratogenic outcome caused by a wide variety of
   anti-epileptic drugs. In this study, we examined the relationship
   between mEH activity and pregnancy outcome, demonstrated the range of
   mEH activity in fibroblast and amniocyte samples and proposed mEH
   activity transmission patterns that are compatible with partially
   dominant inheritance. The mEH activity was measured by a thin-layer
   chromatographic assay. In 30 samples where the pregnancy outcome was
   known, all 15 children diagnosed with fetal anti-epileptic drug effects
   (FADE) had mEH activities of less than 40\% of a control standard.
   Fourteen of the children who failed to exhibit any of the FADE
   dysmorphic stigmata had mEH activity levels of greater than 40\%. These
   results demonstrate that low levels of mEH activity in amniocytes can be
   used to identify fetuses at risk for FADE. mEH enzyme activities were
   additionally determined for eight families complicated by maternal
   anti-convulsant drug therapy. A pattern of transmission was observed
   that corresponds to a two-allele single-locus genetic model, where
   phenotype activity can be described as high (>70\%), intermediate
   (40-70\%) and low (<40\%). This model could be used in pre-pregnancy
   counseling of epileptic women to assess their relative risk for having a

Abstract = {{Although previous studies have confirmed the safety of dobutamine stress
   echocardiography, complex ventricular arrhythmias have been reported.
   Our aim was (1) to identify the markers of increased arrhythymic risk
   during dobutamine stress echocardiography and (2) to assess whether the
   occurrence of major ventricular arrhythmias during the test may
   represent a clinically useful marker of electrical instability. Three
   hundred and seventy-seven consecutive survivors from acute myocardial
   infarction, off cardioactive therapy, underwent dobutamine stress
   echocardiography 11.4 days after the acute event, Holter monitoring with
   assessment of heart rare variability and echocardiographic determination
   of left ventricular ejection fraction. In addition, exercise stress
   testing, signal averaged ECG and coronary angiography were carried out,
   respectively, in 357, 150 and 273 patients. Ten subjects showed complex
   ventricular arrhythmias (eight non-sustained and one sustained
   ventricular tachycardia and one ventricular fibrillation) during
   dobutamine stress echocardiography (group A), whilst 366 did not (group
   B). Complex ventricular arrhythmias were detected by Holter monitoring
   in 8/10 patients in group A and 45/367 patients in group B (odds ratio
   28.6, 95\% CI 5.4-92.2) and by exercise testing in 4/10 patients in
   group A and 33/347 patients in group B (odds ratio 6.3, 95\% CI
   1.4-27.2). Ejection fraction <40\% was present in 3/10 patients in group
   A and 50/367 in group B (odds ratio 2.7, 95\% CI 0.3-12.2), whilst
   multivessel disease was present, respectively, in 8/10 and 176/263
   patients (odds ratio 1.9, 95\% CI 0.3-25.5). Reduced heart rate
   variability and the presence of late potentials on signal averaged ECG
   were found in, respectively, 40/367 and 13/140 patients in group B, but
   none were found in group A. A total of 61 events (35 CABG, 15 PTCA, four
   cardiac deaths and seven non-fatal reinfarctions) occurred during the
   follow-up (11.4 months, range 6 to 20): four in group A and 57 in group
   B. No documented major arrhythmic event was reported. We conclude that
   (1) complex arrhythmias during dobutamine stress may occur in patients
   early after acute myocardial infarction, (2) the preexisting evidence of
   frequent, as well as repetitive, arrhythmias repesents a potential
   marker of increased risk in this connection and finally, (3)
   dobutamine-included arrhythmias seem to represent an uncommon, even
   though potentially dangerous, event but not a useful new `window' on
   electrical instability of post-MI patients.}},

Abstract = {{Around 76\% of the world's population lives in developing countries
   where more fertilizer-N is currently applied than in developed
   countries. Fertilizers are applied preferentially in regions where
   irrigation is available, and soil and climatic conditions are favorable
   for the growth of crop plants. Due to low N application rates during the
   last 3 or 4 decades, negative N balances in the soil are a
   characteristic feature of the crop production systems in developing
   countries. In the future, with increasing fertilizer-N application
   rates, the possibility of nitrate pollution of groundwater in developing
   countries will be strongly linked with fertilizer-N use efficiency. A
   limited number of investigations from developing countries suggest that,
   in irrigated soils of Asia or in humid tropics of Africa, the potential
   exists for nitrate pollution of groundwater, especially if fertilizer-N
   is inefficiently managed. In a large number of developing countries in
   West and Central Asia and North Africa, the small amount of fertilizer
   applied to soils (mostly Aridisols) that remain dry almost all the year,
   do not constitute a major threat for nitrate pollution of groundwater,
   except possibly when soils are irrigated. In Asia and the Pacific
   regions, where 70\% of the fertilizers are used to grow wetland rice on
   soils with low percolation rates, leaching of nitrates is minimal.
   Climatic water balance and soil moisture conditions do not favor
   leaching of nitrates from the small amount of fertilizer-N applied to
   Oxisols and Ultisols in Latin America:rn developing countries located in
   the humid tropics, attempts have not been made to correlate fertilizer-N
   use with nitrate level in groundwater; however, fertilizers are being
   increasingly used. Besides high rainfall, irrigation is becoming
   increasingly available to farmers in the humid tropics and substantial
   leaching of N may also increase.}},

   biodynamics, hydrodynamics, and aerodynamics. Observers described events
   in a free-response task or by circling properties in a list. Cluster
   analyses performed on descriptor frequencies reflected the dynamics.
   Observers discriminated hydro- versus aerodynamic events and animate
   versus inanimate events. The latter result was confirmed by using a
   forced-choice task. Dynamical models of the events led us to consider
   energy flows as a determinant of kinematic properties that allowed
   animacy to be distinguished. Orientation was manipulated in 3 viewing
   conditions. Descriptions varied with absolute display orientation rather
   than the relative orientation of display and observer.}},

Abstract = {{The infection of Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa ssp. pekinensis cv.
   Granaat) with the causal agent of the club root disease, Plasmodiophora
   brassicae Wor., leads to tumorous swellings of the root as a result of
   increased cell division and hypertrophy. An increased auxin formation in
   infected tissue by enzymatic hydrolysis of the precursor
   indole-3-acetonitrile has previously been postulated. Based on a
   recently published nitrilase cDNA sequence of Arabidopsis thaliana, we
   have amplified a partial nitrilase cDNA fragment from Chinese cabbage
   1.strand cDNA, synthesized from hypocotyl total RNA, by polymerase chain
   reaction. Also, genomic nitrilase fragments from Chinese cabbage and
   Brassica oleracea, another host for P. brassicae, were amplified with
   the same set of primers. Sequence comparisons indicate high homology in
   exon and intron regions. The sequenced isoform of Chinese cabbage is
   most closely related to the NIT isoforms 1 and 2 of A. thaliana. Using
   the homologous nitrilase cDNA fragment (504 bp of coding region) as a
   probe, nitrilase mRNA was determined in total RNA from P.
   brassicae-infected and healthy root tissue of Chinese cabbage. In both
   tissues a mRNA of approx. 1.3 kB was detected with similar amounts in
   infected and healthy tissues. Our results suggest that the biotrophic
   pathogen P. brassicae does not affect expression of NIT 1/2-related
   nitrilase(s) at the transcriptional level.}},

Abstract = {{Seed production in buckwheat, Fagopyrum esculentum Moench, can be lower
   than expected from the plant biomass. Low seed production is often
   blamed on inadequate pollination. Honey bees, Apis mellifera L., were at
   least 95\% of the insect visitors to buckwheat flowers in fields of
   central New York State. The number of times each flower was visited by a
   honey bee ranged from zero to >40, but the number of honey bee visits
   did not increase daily seed initiation if each flower was visited at
   least twice. Pollen delivery sometimes limited seed set, but limitation
   was not associated with low honey bee visitation frequency. The yield
   and genetic quality of buckwheat is best with pollen deliveries of at
   least 10 grains, but honey bees delivered less pollen. The time between
   delivery of the Ist and 10th pollen grain was approximate to 1 h, which
   is more than enough for fertilization to occur. Buckwheat in New York is
   pollinated primarily by honey bees, but bee behavior is not well adapted
   to the crop, and the effectiveness of bees as pollinators was not
   improved at higher bee populations.}},

Abstract = {{Programming languages generally provide a `string' or `text' type to
   allow manipulation of sequences of characters. This type is usually of
   crucial importance, since it is normally mentioned in most interfaces
   between system components. We claim that the traditional implementations
   of strings, and often the supported functionality, are not well suited
   to such general-purpose use. They should be confined to applications
   with specific, and unusual, performance requirements. We present `ropes'
   or `heavyweight' strings as an alternative that, in our experience leads
   to systems that are more robust, both in functionality and in
   performance.
   Ropes have been in use in the Cedar environment almost since its
   inception, but this appears to be neither well-known, nor discussed in
   the literature. The algorithms have been gradually refined. We have also
   recently built a second similar, but somewhat lighter weight, C-language
   implementation, which is included in our publically released garbage
   collector distribution.' We describe the algorithms used in both, and
   give some performance measurements for the C version.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium insertion into amorphous thin films of tungsten trioxide (a-WO3)
   prepared by thermal vacuum evaporation of WO3 powder has been studied
   experimentally by chronoamperometry, cyclic voltammetry and ac impedance
   spectroscopy associated with electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance
   (EQCM). During cathodic polarization of the electrode and at short times
   two antagonistic processes. occur. One is a non faradaic process and is
   associated with the expulsion of anions from the electrode surface under
   the effect of the electric field built in the electrolyte when a
   potential difference is imposed between the electrodes. The other one is
   the faradaic insertion of non-solvated lithium ions into the oxide.
   These two processes occur simultaneously. Under application of a
   cathodic overvoltage the former one leads to a loss of mass of the
   electrode and the latter one to a gain of mass. These two processes may
   explain the experimental data. From these data the diffusion coefficient
   of lithium ions into the oxide is determined and it is shown that it
   varies as insertion proceeds. A thermodynamic study of lithium insertion
   into a-WO3 is also performed to solve the equations of the theoretical
   model proposed in Part I of this paper. This thermodynamic study allowed
   us to determine the repulsive and/or attractive interactions between the
   inserted species and the host matrix as insertion occurs and the
   influence of the electronic term on the potential.}},

Abstract = {{The bovine leukemia virus transactivator, BLV Tax, augments
   transcription from three imperfect 21-bp repeats in the viral
   transcriptional regulatory region. Each BLV 21-bp repeat contains a cAMP
   response element (CRE) in the center and unique 5' and 3' neighboring
   sequences which are crucial for the transcriptional activation by BLV
   Tax. Here we describe the interactions of recombinant BLV Tax with
   cellular bZip proteins. The recombinant BLV Tax, tagged at the carboxy
   terminus with a hexahistidine extension, was prepared by solubilization
   in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and renaturation on the Ni2+-chelating
   Sepharose gel matrix. The renatured BLV TaxH(6) activates the BLV LTR
   when introduced into HeLa cells by scrape loading. Furthermore, the
   purified BLV TaxH(6) enhances binding of members of the CREB/ATF family
   of bZip proteins to CRE motifs by interacting with their bZip domains in
   vitro. Chemical cross-linking indicates that dimerization of bZip
   proteins such as CREB becomes greatly facilitated in the presence of BLV
   Tax These results suggest that BLV Tax interacts directly with
   CREB/ATF-like factors to activate viral mRNA transcription. (C) 1995

   two-kidney, one-clip Goldblatt hypertension (2K1C, for 3 and 40 days,
   sham operation for controls), 2) furosemide treatment (150 mg . kg(-1).
   day(-1) ip for 5 days), 3) chronic low-salt diet (0.02\%) vs. high-salt
   diet (3\%; both for 11 days), and 4) chronic blockade of NOS by
   nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 40 mg . kg(-1). day(-1) for 2
   mo). NOS and renin gene expression, NOS enzyme activity and renin IR
   were semiquantitatively evaluated with histochemical methods (NADPH
   diaphorase, in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry). In 2K1C,
   marked increases were induced in NOS and renin in the ischemic vs.
   contralateral kidneys both after 3 and 40 days, respectively (P < 0.05).
   Related to controls, significant increases in the ischemic kidney were
   encountered after 3 and 40 days, whereas contralateral suppression of
   NOS and renin was found only after 40 days. Furosemide treatment
   resulted in a marked increase of both NOS and renin levels compared with
   controls (P < 0.05). Salt restriction induced a significant elevation of
   NOS levels compared with salt loading (P < 0.05), whereas only minor
   changes were evident in renin levels. L-NAME treatment resulted in a
   moderate reduction of NOS activity (not significant), whereas renin
   levels were markedly reduced (P < 0.05). These results show that NOS
   activity and gene expression are inversely related to chronic changes in
   renal perfusion, salt balance, and salt transport at the distal tubule
   in parallel with the known response of renin to these changes.
   Inhibition of NOS decreases renin levels at the JGA. The histochemical
   findings support previous concepts that MD-derived NO is involved in the
   control of renin synthesis.}},

   FRANCE, MAY   13, 1995}},
Abstract = {{Since 1993, with ICD-10 (WHO), and 1994, with DSM IV (APA),
   practitioners have had at their disposal two (practically compatible)
   classifications of mental disorders containing operational criteria for
   diagnosis, and helpful in guiding clinical and therapeutic approach.
   Moreover, the use of one of these classifications (ICD-IO) is compulsory
   in French state psychiatric institutions.
   We shall try to convince that these manuals are useful, and indeed
   unavoidable, henceforth, not only for researchers but also for
   practitioners, for the following reasons :
   `'Any form of order is preferable to chaos'' (Levi Strauss);
   An implicit classification is always at work, even where the clinician
   feels he is working by intuition and treating each patient as a unique
   and individual case. It is not necessarily a bad thing to compare one's
   own stereotypes with currently held beliefs;
   All efforts to evaluate treatments, both psychotherapeutic and
   chemotherapeutic, are now based on these clinical definitions and
   models.
   Particularly as regards mood disorders, DSM III and DMS IV have managed
   to rid us of the uncertainties and contradictions surrounding
   etiopathogenesis (endogenous ? psychogenic ? reactive ? defensive ?
   adaptive ? biological ? etc.) which previously ruled out any explanatory
   classification. There still remain a number of pathological pictures of
   proven existence but with different levels of significance and different
   treatments.
   The bipolar/unipolar distinction (BP/UP) has been strengthened. Major
   depression (actual `'depression'', of moderate severity) remains the
   central model, and exists in both the unipolar and bipolar forms. There
   is also chronic (more than 2 years) progressive dysthymia (UP) which
   corresponds almost exactly to `'Depressive personality''.
   For bipolar disorders, the distinction between bipolar I disorders and
   bipolar II disorders, which is now well-documented, has been retained.
   Cyclothymia (lasting over 2 years) is in a sense the bipolar equivalent
   of dysthymia. Mixed disorders are distinguished from rapid-cycling
   bipolar disorders. It is now known that the range of bipolar disorders
   requires treatment with thymoleptic drugs and that antidepressants
   should be used only in unipolar disorders, and occasionally in bipolar
   forms to treat certain acute episodes of depression.
   Furthermore, many specific clinical forms are defined: post-natal
   depression, seasonal depression, adaptive difficulties with depressive
   mood or anxiety and depression, iatrogenic depression or depression
   related to medication or to inter-current illnesses.
   Moreover, criteria are also suggested `'for future studies'' of
   post-psychotic depression in schizophrenic patients, minor depression,
   brief recurrent depressive episodes and anxio-depressive syndrome.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to assess in vitro the heat generated
   within the implant body when preparing titanium implants of the ITI(R)
   Dental Implant System to estimate the potential risk of tissue damage of
   individual abutment preparation. The speed and the pressure were applied
   according to routine clinical procedures used in the patients mouth.
   Much attention was paid to ensure optimal cooling at the point where the
   implant and secondary part were being cut. For each of 3 preparations
   the change from the original temperature was measured over a period of
   40 s. Each type of preparation was repeated on 5 implants fitted with
   temperature probes. Three different preparatory procedures performed
   with rotating diamond burs and stainless steel finishing burs under
   cooling with spray from the dental unit may result in a maximal increase
   in temperature of 10 degrees, 7 degrees and 3 degrees measured
   coronally, both at the implant shoulder and at the coronal extent of the
   plasma-sprayed surface after 10 s. The use of additional spray and
   pressured air significantly reduced this maximal increase to 5 degrees
   C, 5 degrees C and 4 degrees C, respectively at 10 s, At the 30-s and
   40-s time points, all the measured temperatures were significantly
   lower. Preparation of implants or abutments does not lead to detrimental
   effects on peri-implant tissues provided that adequate cooling with
   spray is used. However, without cooling, extreme overheating could be
   provoked, reaching the critical temperature that would lead to
   irreversible bone damage within only a few seconds.}},

Abstract = {{Remote sensing and geographical information systems are used to analyze
   landscapes important to species of conservation concern. The accuracy of
   the methods depends on how closely habitat mapping classes are linked to
   population demography Habitat use by Florida Scrub Jays (Aphelocoma c.
   coerulescens) was quantified using circular plots. Habitat variation was
   mapped using high-resolution aerial photography on a site where all
   Florida Scrub Jays were color-banded. Nest site selection, nest success,
   yearling production, and breeder survival were measured within Florida
   Scrub Jay territories. Habitat use was lowest in areas without scrub
   oaks or areas within 136 m from forests. Open oak, dominated by scrub
   oaks and open sandy areas, had the highest use and nest success among
   habitats. Open oak occurred as narrow patches (<20 m wine) in landscapes
   dominated by matrix habitat (palmetto-lyonia and swale marshes). Most
   wide patches (>50 m) of open oak were potential population sources,
   where reproduction exceeded mortality. Areas with patches of open oak of
   less than 1 ha were usually population sinks. Open oak occurred as less
   flammable patches in a landscape subject to frequent fires. Population
   sources varied temporally and spatially with fires and sire potential to
   support scrub oaks (soils). Analyses of landscape patterns and dynamics
   indicated that habitat mapping should not only include patches of
   currently optimal habitat but should also include landscapes associated
   with open oak. The influences of landscape patterns on habitat use,
   reproductive success, survival, and territory size can be quantified at
   different scales starting with attributes associated with habitat
   patches, nest sites, and territories. Potential mapping errors occur,
   however, when habitats are used to quantify the areal extent of sources
   and sinks and similar population attributes important for species
   persistence.}},

Abstract = {{The medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) relays auditory
   information important for sound source localization. MNTB neurons
   faithfully preserve the temporal patterning of action potentials (APs)
   occurring in their single giant input synapse, even at high frequencies.
   The aim of this work was to examine the postsynaptic potassium
   conductances that shape the transfer of auditory information across this
   glutamatergic synapse. We used whole cell patch techniques to record
   from MNTB neurons in thin slices of rat brainstem. Two types of
   potassium conductance were found which had a strong influence on an MNTB
   neuron's postsynaptic response. A small low voltage threshold current,
   I-d, limited the response during each EPSP to a single brief AP. I-d was
   specifically blocked by dendrotoxin (DTX), resulting in additional APs
   during the tail end of the EPSP. Thus DTX degraded the temporal fidelity
   of synaptic transmission, since one presynaptic AP then led to several
   postsynaptic APs. A second conductance was a fast delayed rectifier with
   a high voltage activation threshold, that rapidly repolarised APs and
   thus facilitated high frequency AP responses. Together, these two
   conductances allow high frequency auditory information to be passed
   accurately across the MNTB relay synapse and separately, such
   conductances may perform analogous functions elsewhere in the nervous
   system.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL THERAPY}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{1082-1088}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background and Purpose. Although auscultation is routinely used in the
   assessment of respiratory status, the ability of the rater to accurately
   and consistently identify lung sounds has been questioned. The
   literature on this issue is sparse and has focused on reliability of
   auscultation of tape-recorded rather than in vivo lung sounds. The
   purpose of this study were to determine the interrater reliability of
   physical therapists in the direct auscultation of lung sounds based on
   their clinical experience in chest physical therapy and to determine
   whether the adoption of standardized nomenclature and education on
   proper technique and interpretation affects reliability. Subjects and
   Methods. A group of 57 registered physical therapists were stratified by
   clinical experience into four groups. Sixteen therapists (ie, 4 in each
   stratum) were randomly chosen using a random number table. The following
   criteria were developed to delineate clinical experience. Group 1
   subjects were senior chest physical therapists with at least 5 years of
   experience in this area of practice. Group 2 subjects were experienced
   therapists who had a minimum of 2 years of experience in chest physical
   therapy and were currently practicing in this area. Group 3 subjects
   were experienced physical therapists in other areas who were also
   practicing in chest physical therapy on occasional weekend service.
   Group 4 subjects were new graduates. Ten patients were evaluated by each
   group of 4 physical therapists using a teaching stethoscope with one
   diaphragm/bell and four pairs of earpieces. The education session
   consisted of discussion of the adoption of standardized nomenclature and
   education on proper technique and interpretation of auscultation.
   Interrater reliability was assessed before and after the education
   session using kappa (kappa) values. Comparisons were made between kappa
   values before and after the education session to determine the effect of
   education and between groups to determine the effect of clinical
   experience. Results. The kappa values before the education session were
   low, indicating poor reliability in detecting specific abnormal sounds
   (kappa = -.02-.59). Following the education session, there was a general
   improvement in reliability (kappa = -.30-.77), especially for group 3
   (specialists in other areas). The most improvement was noted for the
   detection of the quality of breath sounds (kappa = -.08-.50). Conclusion
   and Discussion. Reliability of auscultation was poor to fair, in
   general, before the education session. There was a definite improvement
   in reliability after the education session. There was no clear effect of
   clinical experience on reliability, and the agreement among observers
   appeared to depend on the abnormal lung sound present. Limitations of
   this study and recommendations for future research are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Poxviruses are unique among viruses in encoding members of the serine
   proteinase inhibitor (serpin) superfamily. Orthopoxviruses contain three
   serpins, designated SPI-1, SPI-2, and SPI-3. SPI-1 encodes a 40-MDa
   protein that is required for the replication of rabbitpox virus (RPV) in
   PK-15 or A549 cells in culture (A. N. Ali, P. C. Turner, M. A. Brooks,
   and R. W. Moyer, Virology 202:305-314 1994). Examination of
   nonpermissive human A549 cells infected with an RPV mutant disrupted in
   the SPI-1 gene (RPV Delta SPI-1) suggests there are no gross defects in
   protein or DNA synthesis. The proteolytic processing of late viral
   structural proteins, a feature of orthopoxvirus infections associated
   with the maturation of virus particles, also appears relatively normal.
   However, very few mature virus particles of any kind are produced
   compared with the level found in infections with wild-type RPV.
   Morphological examination of RPV Delta SPI-1-infected A549 cells,
   together with an observed fragmentation of cellular DNA, suggests that
   the host range defect is associated with the onset of apoptosis.
   Apoptosis is seen only in RPV Delta SPI-1 infection of nonpermissive
   (A549 or PK-15) cells and is absent in all wild-type RPV infections and
   RPV Delta SPI-2 mutant infections examined to date. Although the SPI-1
   gene is expressed early, before DNA replication, the triggering
   apoptotic event occurs late in the infection, as RPV Delta
   SPI-1-infected A549 cells do not undergo apoptosis when infections are
   carried out in the presence of cytosine arabinoside. While the SPI-2
   (crmA) gene, when transfected into cells, has been shown to inhibit
   apoptosis, our experiments provide the first indication that a poxvirus
   serpin protein can inhibit apoptosis during a poxvirus infection.}},

Abstract = {{The pattern of tumour invasion of the mandible depends on the extent of
   invasion. Both the width (P = 0.02) and depth (P = 0.01) in patients
   with an invasive or infiltrative pattern of disease were greater than in
   tumours showing the less aggressive erosive pattern in which the tumour
   mass is separated from the resorbing bone by a connective-tissue layer.
   Evidence in this study suggests that the erosive pattern develops
   through a mixed pattern to the invasive pattern of disease as the tumour
   progresses through the bone. The invasive pattern of disease was evident
   at a much shallower depth in the molar region of the mandible (mean 9
   mm), with a decreased ratio of alveolar to basal bone, than in the
   premolar and parasymphyseal region (mean 25 mm) (P = 0.02). The
   hypothesis to explain this phenomenon is that the more superficial
   alveolar bone responds by resorbing in advance of the tumour, but the
   basal bone is unable to respond in the same way and becomes widely
   infiltrated. The attached mucosa with its firm collagen attachment to
   bone is proposed as the main route of tumour entry into the mandible in
   both dentate and edentulous mandibles.}},

Abstract = {{The amino acid and gross compositions of three benthic diatoms
   (Cylindrotheca fusiformis Reimann and Lewin, Navicula jeffreyi

   three chain-forming diatoms (Lauderia annulata Cleve, Skeletonema
   costatum (Greville) Cleve and a tropical Skeletonema sp. (CS-252)), were
   determined during late-logarithmic growth phase.
   Four of the six species were rich in protein, ranging from 31\% (S.
   costatum) to 38\% (N. closterium) of the dry weight, and contained 4.9
   to 6.5\% carbohydrate and 9.4 to 18\% ash. The other two species, C.
   fusiformis and L. annulata contained only 16\% protein but had nearly
   twice the total carbohydrate (11 to 12\%) and two to three times the ash
   (29 to 35\%) of the other species. All species contained a similar
   percentage of lipid (18 to 20\%), and a high protein quality based on
   their total amino acid composition.
   The usefulness of these diatoms for mariculture will be determined by
   growth rates, gross composition and acceptability to the animal. N.
   closterium had the fastest growth rates of the benthic mat-forming
   diatoms, it was rich in protein, and it may be a good candidate for
   abalone culture. The two Skeletonema spp. had the fastest growth rates
   of the chain-forming diatoms, and are already widely used for prawn
   larval culture in Australia. Feeding trials are now necessary to confirm
   the high nutritional value of these diatom species for specific animals.}},

Abstract = {{The midstage spermatid of Monoclea gottschei subsp. elongata displays
   typical features of the subclass Marchantiidae. The multilayered
   structure (MLS) is four-layered (S-1-S-4). The spline (S-1) is comprised
   of 26 microtubules at its maximum width and has a closed aperture with a
   predominant width of 3 microtubule diameter equivalents. The outline of
   the spline is spatulate, resulting from the presence of shorter
   microtubules on the left martin. The underlying lamellar strip (LS,
   S-2-S-4) is longitudinally elongate and ovate, 1.8 mu m in length and
   0.8 mu m in width, with a right lateral offset or notch. The basal
   bodies are staggered in insertion and overlapping. The anterior basal
   body (ABB), at 0.7 mu m, diverges outward from the longitudinal axis of
   the spline while the posterior basal body (PBB), at 0.8 mu m, is
   essentially parallel with the spline microtubules. These data indicate a
   relationship of the monotypic order Monocleales, with the subclass
   Marchantiidae and also with the genus Blasia. The compact blepharoplast,
   overlapping basal bodies of similar lengths, LS with right lateral notch
   and the three-microtubule aperture are shared features that characterize
   this alliance of liverworts.}},

Title = {{Effect of cycloheximide and mRNA synthesis inhibition on death of
   trophically deprived ciliary ganglion neurons in culture}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{74}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2487-2499}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. The relationship between cycloheximide (CHX) and RNA synthesis
   inhibitors on trophic-deprived neuronal survival was studied with the
   use of primary cultures of stage (St) 34 chick ciliary ganglion (CG)
   neurons, to analyze the biological process of neuronal death caused by
   trophic factor withdrawal. Tissue culture conditions were refined by
   characterizing the additional medium components required to obtain 100\%
   survival, for at least 1 wk, in the presence of an eye extract
   {[}choroid, ciliary body, iris, and pigment epithelium (CIPE)] as a
   trophic support for the neurons. Highly enriched neuronal cultures
   almost devoid of nonneuronal cells were used.
   2. The time at which trophically deprived neurons cannot be rescued by
   the addition of trophic support, `'commitment point,'' was established
   to be between 11 and 17 h after trophic deprivation.
   3. CHX, an inhibitor of protein translation, reduced H-3-leucine
   incorporation by 90-95\%, at a concentration of 10-100 mu g/ml. The
   effect of the RNA transcription blockers actinomycin D (Act-D),
   alpha-amanitin, and 5,6 dichlorobenzimidazole riboside (DRB) on
   H-3-uridine incorporation into macromolecules was evaluated, Total RNA
   synthesis was inhibited by 10-25\% by alpha-amanitin, whereas Act-D and
   DRB inhibited 80-97.5\% of the H-3-uridine incorporation.
   4. The effect of short- and long-term incubation with CHX on neuronal
   survival was analyzed. Continuous application of CHX promoted survival
   for 2-3 days, but thereafter neurons died regardless of whether CIPE was
   present or absent. Application of CHX for 6 h from the onset of the
   culture was enough to delay the committment point up to 24 h after
   plating, and the addition of CIPE at this time maintained survival and
   promoted differentiation of CHX treated neurons.
   5. The RNA transcription blockers Act-D, alpha-amanitin, and DRB were
   applied to both trophically deprived and trophically supported neurons,
   and the survival of each was evaluated. Neither drug was effective in
   supporting the survival of trophically deprived neurons in culture, and
   in most cases neurons even when cultured with CIPE died within 1-2 days
   in the presence of either drug.
   6. Experiments using both CHX and mRNA synthesis blockers were performed
   to determine the effect of blocking mRNA transcription in trophically
   deprived neurons rescued by CHX. The addition of mRNA synthesis
   inhibitors precluded the effect of CHX on neuronal survival.
   7. The effect of CHX (20 mu g/ml) on RNA and protein synthesis was
   studied by measuring the incorporation of radiolabeled metabolic
   precursors (H-3-leucine or H-3-uridine) into macromolecules. A 95\%
   reduction in the protein synthesis was observed after 1 h of application
   of the drug, and by 24 h, H-3-leucine incorporation was reduced to
   15-20\% of the control values. Wash out of CIM after 6 h of incubation
   produced a recovery of protein synthesis up to 50\% of control values 18
   h later. CHX did not affect the synthesis of RNA for up to 12 h;
   however, it impaired the ability of the cell to take up metabolic
   precursors.
   8. In conclusion, the present results support the hypothesis that the
   CHX effect on neuronal survival is due to its ability to induce the
   expression of survival or protective genes rather than to block the
   expression of killer proteins. This view is supported by 1) the 24-h
   delay of the commitment point following the short-term application of
   CHX, 2) the impaired ability of CHX to rescue trophic-deprived neurons
   by the addition of mRNA synthesis blockers, and 3) the fact that
   neuronal survival caused by trophic factors like CIPE, is blocked by
   blocking RNA transcription.}},

Abstract = {{The recently inaugurated World Trade Organization (WTO) formally
   specifies and protects intellectual property rights as it sets the rules
   for a global open-market economy. It does so by advancing a culturally
   specific notion of property rights as private and exclusive. In so
   doing, the WTO also promotes the defining concepts of liberalism-rights
   and property-and extends them globally in the service of open-market
   principles. Liberalism, originally a seventeenth-century European
   political theory, is now recognizable as a distinct ensemble of cultural
   practices and meanings. As international interactions are increasingly
   defined by liberal concepts and conform to liberal principles a nascent
   global culture of liberalism develops distinctively from its national
   forms. This article places these events in several broad contexts,

Abstract = {{Achieving component-level thermal characterization using computational
   fluid dynamics (CFD) is assessed using a case study approach, A
   commercial CFD code (FLOTHERM(R)(1)) is used to simulate the thermal
   performance of three plastic-based microelectronic packages (68-lead and
   84-lead plastic leaded chip carriers or PLCC's, and a 164-lead plastic
   quad flat pack or PQFP) under forced air cooling conditions, Predictions
   of junction-to-ambient thermal resistance (theta(j alpha)) are compared
   to experimental measurements, One aspect of the work is to use results
   from a single situation (84-PLCC and an approach air velocity of 1.52
   m/s) to develop a set of `'modeelng guidelines.'' These modeling
   guidelines are then applied to the other components (68-PLCC and
   164-PQFP) and flow conditions (0.76-3.05 m/s) to test their validity,
   Guideline parameters include near component flow field nodalization,
   geometric detail in representing conduction paths and code user options
   such as turbulent flow models, The average deviation of predicted versus
   measured values of theta(j alpha) was 7.5\% using the derived
   guidelines, An additional component design sensitivity investigated was
   the effect of the introduction of a heat spreading `'heat post'' in the
   high temperature regions of the 164-PQFP.}},

Abstract = {{The growth suppressor protein p53 is abnormally expressed in a variety
   of different human tumor cells. We have analyzed the expression of p53
   in cell cultures derived from tissues of radical prostatectomies and in
   the permanent prostate carcinoma cell line PC-3 using two different p53
   specific monoclonal antibodies. With the wild-type specific monoclonal
   antibody PAb1620 we found p53 localized in nucleoli whereas only a few
   cells were positively stained in the nucleus with the mutant specific
   monoclonal antibody PAb240. Control experiments with p53 from SV80 cells
   which express wild-type p53 and HT29 cells expressing mutant p53
   documented the specificity of the monoclonal antibodies. The specificity
   of the antibodies in recognizing indeed p53 was demonstrated further by
   immunoprecipitation analysis of p53 from the same cell cultures. Since
   p53 is usually localized to the nucleus our results may represent a
   specific feature of the wild-type phenotype of p53 in prostate carcinoma
   cells. The localization of p53 in nucleoli may be another mechanism of
   the inactivation of wild-type p53.}},

Abstract = {{In this article a model for the evolution of a spherically symmetric,
   nonnecrotic tumor is presented. The effects of nutrients and inhibitors
   on the existence and stability of time-independent solutions are
   studied. With a single nutrient and no inhibitors present, the trivial
   solution, which corresponds to a state in which no tumor is present,
   persists for all parameter values, whereas the nontrivial solution,
   which corresponds to a tumor of finite size, exists for only a
   prescribed range of parameters, which corresponds to a balance between
   cell proliferation and cell death. Stability analysis, based on a
   two-timing method, suggests that, where it exists, the nontrivial
   solution is stable and the trivial solution unstable. Otherwise, the
   trivial solution is stable. Modification to these characteristic states
   brought about by the presence of different types of inhibitors are also
   investigated and shown to have significant effect. Implications of the
   model for the treatment of cancer are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Fluid venting in accretionary prisms, which feeds chemosynthetic
   biological communities, occurs mostly on the marginal thrust ridge. New
   seismic data for the marginal ridge of the Cascadia prism show
   significantly lower velocity than that in the adjacent oceanic basin and
   place important constraints on the interpretations of why fluid venting
   occurs mostly on the marginal ridge. We employed a finite-element method
   to analyze a typical fault-bend folding model to explain the phenomenon.
   The fault in the model is simulated by contact elements. The elements
   are characterized not only by finite sliding along a slide line, but
   also by elastoplastic deformation.
   We present the results of a stress analysis which show that the marginal
   ridge is under subhorizontal extension and the frontal thrust is under
   compression. This state of stress favors the growth of tensile cracks in
   the marginal ridge, facilitates fluid flow and reduces seismic
   velocities therein; on the other hand, it may close fluid pathways along
   the frontal thrust and divert fluid how to the marginal ridge.}},

Abstract = {{In 1935, 32 ha of a pine-hardwood forest were set aside from future
   timber management in southern Arkansas, U.S.A. Old-growth timber had
   been cut to a 36-cm stump diameter before 1915. Between 1952 and 1993,
   four inventories were made of the overstory and midstory components
   (number of live trees greater than or equal to 9 cm in diameter breast
   height (DBH) taken at 1.37 m, by 2.54-cm DBH classes). Between 1954 and
   1992, four corresponding inventories were made of the woody vegetation
   (>15 cm tall but <9 cm DBH) by counting rootstocks within 52
   systematically spaced 8-m(2) circular quadrats. Understory species
   importance values (relative density + relative height + relative
   frequency) were used to compute diversity and similarity indices. During
   38 years of assessment, no catastrophic disturbances occurred within the
   32-ha forest. Although loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) and shortleaf pine
   (Pinus echinata Mill.) dominated the overstory (64\% of basal area in
   1954 and 63\% in 1993), pines were absent from the understory in all but
   seedling size classes for the last 38 years. Woody understory diversity
   indices were essentially stable for 38 years, but the similarity of
   understory species tended to decline as the time between inventories
   increased. Relative importance values for woody understory species
   tended to increase for the more shade-tolerant genera and decrease for
   less tolerant genera. Survival and height growth of woody understory
   species were also found to be positively correlated with shade
   tolerance.}},

Abstract = {{Subjects rated the overall perceived intensity of concentrations of the

   smelled alone and in binary mixtures. The subjects also rated intensity
   of specified constituents (e.g. amount of cineole in cineole, and in
   mixtures of cineole and linalyl acetate). The intensity of the stronger
   component alone offered a close description of perceived intensity. In
   addition to the Stronger Component model, two other psychological models
   (Vector and U model) and two psychophysical models (UPLZ and Equiratio
   Mixture model) offered descriptions ranging from fair to very good.
   Psychological models gave better fits, but lack explanatory power. Some
   results indicated that weaker odors add more potently than stronger
   odors, an outcome incompatible with these models. The psychophysical
   models, based on the additivity of single components, generally

Abstract = {{This paper is devoted to VLSI implementation of a staged decoder for
   Block-Coded Modulation (BCM). We first review a general parallel and
   pipelined implementation of the decoder and we identify the parameters
   to be considered for optimization. A particular BCM scheme, based on the
   8-PSK signal set, is chosen for a case study. Several ideas are
   described leading to a code-optimized design, and hardware
   implementation is shown, Next, we evaluate the performance of our
   design. In particular it is shown that, by exploiting regularity, a
   simple structure which achieves a throughput rate of 10 Mbps can be
   implemented by using 23 K transistors and 2 mu standard cells CMOS
   technology. Further optimization and simple stacking of ten processors
   on a single chip in a block-processing structure allows us to achieve a
   throughput rate of 100 Mbps with about 150 K transistors (38 K gates).}},

Abstract = {{Dilemmas about resuscitation and life-prolonging treatment for severely
   compromised infants have become increasingly complex as skills in
   neonatal care have developed. Quality of life and resource issues
   necessarily influence management. Our Institute of Medical Ethics
   working party, on whose behalf this paper is written, recognises that
   the ultimate responsibility for the final decision rests with the doctor
   in clinical charge of the infant. However, we advocate a team approach
   to decision-making, emphasising the important role of parents and nurses
   in the process. Assessing the relative burdens and benefits cart be
   troubling, but doctors and parents need to retain a measure of
   discretion; legislation which would determine action in all cases is
   inappropriate. Caution should be exercised in involving committees in
   decision-making and, where they exist, their remit should remain to
   advise rather than to decide. Support for families who bear the
   consequences of their decisions is often inadequate, and facilitating
   access to such services is pan of the wider responsibilities of the
   intensive care team. The authors believe that allowing death by
   withholding or withdrawing treatment is legitimate, where those closely
   involved in the care of the infant together deem the burdens to be
   unacceptable without compensating benefits for the infant. As pan of the
   process accurate and careful recording is essential.}},

Abstract = {{Mature trees of a single clone of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.)
   Carr.) growing in the field were exposed to simulated acid mist at pH
   2.5 over three successive years. The growth of each tree in the acid
   mist treatment, in terms of the stem area increment was related to the
   pattern of growth of the untreated trees at the site during 1991 and
   1992. In 1993, the effects of stopping the acid mist treatment on half
   of the treated trees was investigated by comparing the actual growth
   against that predicted relative to the untreated trees on the basis of
   the previous years' data. The prediction of growth from one year to the
   next was consistently too small for the smallest acid-misted trees,
   suggesting that the growth rates relative to the untreated trees were
   increasing with time. Relative to the trees which continued to receive
   acid mist, however, the smaller trees which received no further acid
   mist in 1993 grew less than predicted, but there was a significantly
   greater growth than predicted for the largest `recovering' trees.
   Results from the individual tree modelling approach showed that a 10\%
   change in relative stem area increment would be detectable at the 5\%
   level, using a block of 4 trees as a treatment unit. The statistical
   techniques used are alternatives to conventional ANOVA calculations in.
   determining statistically significant treatment effects where numbers of
   replicates are small.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to determine whether there are
   stimulus-response (S-R) compatibility effects in a manual tracking task
   for male and female subjects of different ages. 20 healthy men and 20
   healthy women in each of three different age groups (20 to 39, 40 to 59,
   and 60 to 79 years) participated (total N = 120). Subjects performed
   extension and flexion movements of the index finger metacarpophalangeal
   joint to track a computer-screen cursor along a target sine wave. The
   hand and forearm were positioned so that the finger movement was either
   vertical or horizontal, and the computer monitor was positioned so that
   the voluntary cursor movement was either vertical or horizontal. Each
   subject performed four different tracking tests corresponding to the
   four different ensembles of hand-forearm position and monitor position.
   There were significant differences in tracking performance between test
   ensembles in both women and men aged 60 to 79 years, and the compatible
   ensembles showed the superior performance. The results suggest that S-R
   compatibility effects exist in elderly women and elderly men performing
   a finger-movement tracking task, and these effects ate consistent with
   impaired information processing in elderly persons. More research is
   needed on how S-R compatibility affects performance in persons with
   cerebral lesions.}},

Abstract = {{The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) has the
   responsibility for safeguarding the food supply from authorised and
   accidental releases of radioactivity to the environment. MAFF funds a
   radiological research programme to assist in the achievement of its
   objectives and has recognised that there is a continuing requirement to
   develop cost effective and sensitive analytical methods for the
   detection of very low levels of radioactivity in foodstuffs. High
   resolution gamma spectrometry is often the most appropriate analytical
   method for the determination of Ru-103, Ru-106, Cs-134 and Cs-137 but
   the detection limits for these radionuclides in bulk foodstuffs do not
   permit the acquisition of accurate data at very low levels. Beta
   counting techniques offer inherently higher sensitivities but the
   development of radiochemical separation techniques is essential to
   provide appropriate counting sources. A radiochemical separation method
   has been developed for the determination of radiocaesium and
   radioruthenium in 0.5 kg fresh wt samples of a variety of foodstuffs.
   The method was shown to be robust and specific and mean method
   recoveries of 75\% were obtained for both radiocaesium and
   radioruthenium. MDA's for the 1000 min counts on a gas-flow proportional
   counter were determined to be 0.015 Bq/kg fresh wt for both Cs-137 and

Abstract = {{Theoretical and experimental studies are undertaken of the feasibility
   of an air-breathing supersonic combustor based on a stabilized,
   conically configured (oblique) detonation wave. The conical wave is the
   result of the interaction of a train of spherical detonation waves, each
   directly initiated by a brief, localized deposition of energy from a
   very-rapidly-repeated pulsed laser. The laser is tightly focused on a
   fixed site (in the combustor) where there is a steady uniform supersonic
   stream of combustible gas. Simple analysis of the requirements for
   (nonintrusive) direct initiation of an individual spherical detonation
   wave by a single laser pulse relates the pulse-energy and pulse-duration
   parameters. Then, an estimate is given of the entropy production
   associated with the early-time interaction of spherical detonations
   created in a supersonic reactive stream by a train of laser pulses. The
   entropy production, which arises from reflected shocks in the already
   detonated mixture, is reduced by increasing the repetition rate of the
   laser. Finally, the fuel/air mixing is inevitably imperfect in practical
   high-speed combustors. We investigate that portion of the throughput
   which is compressed, but not reacted, during transit of the conical
   detonation wave, because of imperfect mixing. Specifically, we estimate
   the spatial scale of the cold-mixture inhomogeneity that still permits
   diffusive burnup, prior to exhaust from the nozzle of the combustor.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we report that two human long-term endometrial cancer cell
   lines, Ishikawa and HEC-1A, exhibit quite different abilities in
   metabolizing estrogens. As a matter of fact, incubation of Ishikawa
   cells with close-to-physiological concentrations of estradiol (E(2)) as
   precursor resulted in: (1) elevated formation (up to 90\%) of
   E(2)-sulphate (E(2)-S), using lower precursor concentrations; (2) very
   limited conversion to estrone (E(1)) (<10\% at 24 h incubation), as
   either free or sulphate; and (3) low but consistent production of other
   estrogen derivatives, such as 2-hydroxy-estrogens and estriol.
   Conversely, scant amounts (if any) of E(2)-S were found in HEC-1A cells,
   while no detectable formation of other estrogen metabolites could be
   observed after 24h. On the other hand, E(1) production was significantly
   greater (nearly 60\% at 24 h) than in Ishikawa cells, a large proportion
   of E(1) (over 50\% of the total) being formed after only 6 h incubation
   using time-course experiments. The hypothesis that E(2) metabolism could
   be minor in Ishikawa cells as a consequence of the high rate of E(2)-S
   formation encountered is contradicted by the evidence that conversion to
   E(1) also remains limited in the presence of much lower E(2)-S amounts,
   seen using higher molar concentrations of precursor. Overall, we observe
   that 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17 beta-HSD) activity
   diverges significantly in intact Ishikawa and HEC-1A endometrial cancer
   cells. This difference could not merely be accounted for by the diverse
   amounts of substrate (E(2)) available to the cells, nor may it be
   imputed to different levels of endogenous estrogens. It should rather be
   sought in different mechanisms controlling 17 beta-HSD activity or,
   alternatively, in the presence of distinct isoenzymes in the two
   different cell types.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to compare the protein isoform composition of
   the contractile apparatus at different levels of the fetoplacental
   vessel musculature at term.
   STUDY DESIGN: Umbilical, chorionic, and stem villi vessel protein
   extracts were run on one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis;
   previously characterized human myometrium proteins were used as the
   smooth muscle proteins of reference.
   RESULTS: Fetoplacental vessel musculature exhibited a high actin/myosin
   ratio. The presence, in varying quantities, of myosin heavy chain and
   actin isoforms of smooth muscle type in the different vessels reflected
   their degree of differentiation. The presence of nonmuscle protein
   isoforms, particularly in stem villi vessels, indicated a certain degree
   of immaturity.
   CONCLUSIONS: The presence of smooth muscle contractile protein isoforms
   indicates that fetoplacental vessel musculature is highly
   differentiated. Regional modulation of fetoplacental blood flow could
   be, in part, the result of local differences in contractile apparatus
   protein composition.}},

Abstract = {{Gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha
   (TNF-alpha) have been suggested as possible effector molecules of the
   cytotoxic beta-cell injury leading to Type I (insulin-dependent)
   diabetes mellitus. In this study we evaluated the cytotoxicity induced
   by gamma-IFN and TNF-alpha on a human insulinoma cell line infected with
   mumps virus and compared this with non-infected cells, A reduction of
   50\% in the viability of non-infected cells was observed with 100 IU/ml
   of gamma-IFN or with 25 IU/ml gamma-IFN + 25 IU/ml TNF-alpha in
   combination, Cells infected with mumps virus showed a 50\% reduction of
   viability with 25 IU/ml of gamma-IFN, and with 12 IU/ml gamma-IFN + 12
   IU/ml TNF-alpha in combination, Up to 1000 IU/ml of TNF-alpha alone was
   not cytotoxic to beta-cells in vitro, but TNF-alpha at a concentration
   of 100 IU/ml reduced viral infected cell viability by 50\%, The
   reduction in cell viability due to the infection alone was < 5\%, These
   data demonstrate that mumps virus infected beta-cells are more
   susceptible to the cytotoxic damage caused by cytokines, The high
   susceptibility of infected beta-cells to cytokine-mediated injury
   following viral infection may contribute to beta-cell damage occurring
   in vivo in Type I diabetes.}},

   Like chlordiazepoxide (5 and 10 mg/kg) and diazepam (1.25 and 2.5
   mg/kg), 0.125 mg/kg 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT),
   a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, and 5 and 10 mg/kg ipsapirone, a partial
   agonist at these receptors, increased the rates of punished responding,
   whereas (8)-WAY 100135, a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, had no effect at
   doses from 1 to 10 mg/kg. 8-OH-DPAT and ipsapirone, like
   benzodiazepines, significantly reduced unpunished responding. The
   5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonists ritanserin (2 mg/kg), mianserin (8
   mg/kg), and mesulergine (0.1 mg/kg) significantly increased the rates of
   punished responding, whereas 0.5-2 mg/kg ketanserin, that has higher

   (0.001-0.1 mg/kg), had no effect on punished or unpunished responding.
   The results show that agents acting as full or partial agonists at
   5-HT1A receptors and blockers of postsynaptic 5-HT2C receptors have
   anxiolytic-like effects in a model of punished operant responding,

Abstract = {{We report the results of observations of AE Aquarii made on 25 occasions
   between July 1992 and October 1993 with the University of Durham very
   high energy (VHE) gamma-ray telescopes at Narrabri, N.S.W., Australia.
   The observations lasted for a total of 78 h and no persistent low-level
   pulsed emission was detected above an energy threshold of 350 GeV.
   However, an excess of pulsed VHE gamma-rays was observed on 1993 October
   11. The burst lasted for approximately 4200 s and occurred at phase
   0.62-0.74 in the 9.88 h orbital cycle. The count rate excess was
   significant at the 0.99997 level and the periodicity was at the second
   harmonic of the 33 s period.
   The hadron-induced background in the burst data has been suppressed by
   applying simple imaging techniques to those events recorded by an
   individual telescope and using trigonometric height of maximum analysis
   for the events recorded by two telescopes. These two independent results
   together provide evidence at a probability of chance occurrence of
   10(-7) after allowing for degrees of freedom, for the emission of a
   burst of pulsed gamma-rays from AE Aquarii with threshold energy > 350
   GeV, which show the characteristic features of gamma-ray induced
   cascades. There is also some evidence to suggest that the brightness
   spectrum of Cerenkov events recorded during the burst is harder than
   that recorded in a sample of the background. The flux during the burst
   was approximately 4\% of the total cosmic ray background at E > 350 GeV,
   corresponding to a peak pulsed luminosity of 10(32) erg s(-1).}},

Abstract = {{Non-ulcer dyspepsia is a common disorder in clinical practice. The
   pathogenesis and predisposing factors that lead to the development of
   Helicobacter pylori infection are still unclear. The aim of the present
   study was to evaluate the prevalence of H. pylori infection in non-ulcer
   dyspepsia patients with delayed gastric emptying and those with normal
   gastric emptying, and to determine if delayed gastric emptying
   predisposes to H. pylori infection. A total of 70 patients (29 males, 41
   females) aged 18-59 years (mean +/- S.D. 40.5 +/- 11.2 years) took part
   in the study. A solid-phase scintigraphic gastric emptying study and
   C-14 urea breath test were performed on each patient. There was no
   statistically significant difference in age between those patients with
   and without delayed gastric emptying (40.8 +/- 11.9 vs 40.4 +/- 10.5
   years), or between those with and without H, pylori infection (40.5 +/-
   12.6 vs 40.5 +/- 9.8 years). Of the 70 patients, 45 (64.3\%) had delayed
   gastric emptying and 25 (35.7\%) had normal gastric emptying. The
   overall incidence of H. pylori infection was 58.6\%. The incidence of H.
   pylori infection among patients with delayed gastric emptying was 60\%
   (27/45 patients) and among patients with normal gastric emptying 56\%
   (14/25 patients). The incidence of H. pylori infection in the two groups
   was not significantly different. The incidence of H. pylori infection in
   the non-ulcer dyspepsia patients in this study was similar to that of
   age-matched asymptomatic volunteers in Taiwan. In conclusion, based on
   the results of this study, delayed gastric emptying does not lead to a
   predisposition to H. pylori infection in non-ulcer dyspepsia patients.}},

Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{100}},

Abstract = {{Experiments were carried out at different times of hibernation to
   ascertain whether prostaglandin is produced by Rana ovarian follicles
   during gonadotropin- or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate
   (TPA)-induced in vitro ovulation. Ovarian fragments were cultured in
   amphibian Ringer in the presence or absence of frog pituitary homogenate
   (FPH, 0.05 gland/ml) or TPA (1 or 10 mu M). After various periods of
   culture, incidence of ovulation was determined and prostaglandin F-2
   alpha (PGF(2 alpha)) accumulated in culture medium was measured by
   radioimmunoassay. FPH and TPA increased PGF(2 alpha) levels in medium in
   a dose-dependent manner. The time course of PGF(2 alpha) secretion and
   ovulation by FPH or TPA treatment varied during the hibernation period.
   In early-hibernation, FPH stimulated neither PGF(2 alpha) secretion nor
   ovulation while TPA stimulated PGF(2 alpha) secretion, although it
   failed to induce ovulation. In mid-hibernation, FPH and TPA effectively
   stimulated PGF(2 alpha) secretion and ovulation, but both events took
   place several hours later than those observed in late-hibernation. Some
   fragments obtained in mid-hibernation and most obtained in
   late-hibernation spontaneously produced PGF(2 alpha) in vitro without
   FPH or TPA treatment and in some instances spontaneously ovulated.
   Furthermore, FPH or TPA increased PGF(2 alpha) levels further or
   accelerated the time course of secretion by such fragments. In late
   hibernation, PGF(2 alpha) secretion induced with FPH or TPA increased
   simultaneously with or later than onset of ovulation. Exogenous cAMP
   (2.5 mu M) or 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7, 100
   mu M), a PKC inactivator, markedly suppressed FPH- or TPA-stimulated
   PGF(2 alpha) secretion and ovulation in mid-hibernation. Indomethacin
   (IM, 5 mu g/ml) strongly suppressed TPA- or FPH stimulated PGF(2 alpha)
   production by fragments but its effect on ovulation varied among animals
   and at different times. IM suppressed ovulation of some ovarian
   fragments obtained in mid-hibernation, but failed to suppress
   hormone-induced ovulation in late-hibernation. Cycloheximide (5 mu g/ml)
   and actinomycin D (1 mu g/ml) effectively suppressed FPH stimulated
   PGF(2 alpha) production and ovulation, whereas actinomycin D reduced but
   failed to significantly suppress TPA-induced PGF(2 alpha) production in
   mid-hibernation. In general, effects of ovulation inhibitors exhibited
   strong seasonal variations and were less efficient as the breeding
   season approached. Taken together, the data suggest that elevated levels
   of PGF(2 alpha) are associated with spontaneous and hormone-induced
   ovulation, and PKC mediates gonadotropin induction of PGF(2 alpha) but
   not steroid synthesis in Rana ovaries. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) has become the choice of
   treatment for symptomatic gallbladder stones. The goal of this study was
   to predict the necessity for ERCP before LC using the noninvasive method
   of liver function testing (LFT) and sonography. Methods: Before LC, 115
   symptomatic gallbladder stone patients, whose diagnoses were confirmed
   by sonography, were studied by both LFT and ERCP. Patients who were
   already found to have either turners or intrahepatic biliary stones on
   sonogram were excluded. Patients were classified into normal and dilated
   biliary tree groups by sonographic findings and normal and abnormal LFT
   (including bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyl transferase
   and amylase) groups. Results: In patients with both normal biliary
   sonogram and LFT, 97.6\% of patients had a negative ERCP study. Biliary
   tree dilation on sonogram had an 87\% positive predictability for ductal
   pathology on ERCP (40/46). A normal biliary tree on sonogram had a
   17.4\% incidence of positive ductal pathology on ERCP (12/69). A single
   abnormal LFT equated to a 68.8\% positive predictability for ductal
   pathology on ERCP. Conclusion: ERCP is not necessary before LC for
   patients with symptomatic gallbladder stones who have both a normal
   biliary tree on sonogram and normal LFT. A patient with either a dilated
   bile duct on sonogram or an abnormal liver function test does require
   ERCP study.}},

   library constructed from a human tumoral brain. This library was
   screened with an antibody raised against the cytochrome P450tu that was
   shown to be over-expressed in chemically induced mouse hepatic tumors.
   Using this cDNA as a probe, a full-length cDNA was characterized. its
   nucleotide sequence shows no significant similarity with any of the gene
   sequences collected in the various DNA data bases. The translation of
   the larger open reading frame leads to a putative protein of 1972 amino

   blot and on metaphase chromosomes indicate that this gene is present as
   a single copy in the genome and is localized on the short arm of
   chromosome 11. ch-TOG transcripts are present in several human tissues.
   Over-expression of ch-TOG in neoplastic liver and colon compared with

Abstract = {{Cambodia's deepwater (floating rice) area was actively suppressed during
   1975-1979 when political emphasis on irrigation and high-yielding
   lowland rice was pushed beyond rational limits, and many varieties were
   lost. Deepwater rice production is ecologically far more complex and
   challenging than irrigated rice. Breeding programmes must utilize
   testing in farmers' fields at early stages of the breeding cycle in
   order to ensure local adaptation to the diverse environments. Since
   1987, introductions of previously existing varieties and breeding
   materials from ecologically related areas have been emphasized for
   Cambodia. The combined vertical support from IRRI headquarters with
   lateral support from the. Thai-IRRI breeding programme has helped to
   start the Cambodian breeding programme. Its variety field testing work
   in Cambodia has been carried out by a unique informal network linking
   Ministry of Agriculture officials with farmers, supported by appropriate

   (HTAFR77022-45-3-2-1), Khao Tah Petch, and Tewada were released to

Abstract = {{Most theories of open ionic channels ignore heat generated by current
   flow, but that heat is known to be significant when analogous currents
   flow in semiconductors, so a generalization of the Poisson-Nernst-Planck
   theory of channels, called the hydrodynamic model, is needed. The
   hydrodynamic theory is a combination of the Poisson and Euler field
   equations of electrostatics and fluid dynamics, conservation laws that
   describe diffusive and convective flow of mass, heat, and charge (i.e.,
   current), and their coupling. That is to say, it is a kinetic theory of
   solute and solvent flow, allowing heat and current flow as well, taking
   into account density changes, temperature changes, and electrical
   potential gradients. We integrate the equations with an essentially
   nonoscillatory shock-capturing numerical scheme previously shown to be
   stable and accurate. Our calculations show that 1) a significant amount
   of electrical energy is exchanged with the permeating ions; 2) the local
   temperature of the ions rises some tens of degrees, and this temperature
   rise significantly alters the ionic flux in a channel 25 Angstrom long,
   such as gramicidin-A; and 3) a critical parameter, called the saturation
   velocity, determines whether ionic motion is overdamped
   (Poisson-Nernst-Planck theory), is in an intermediate regime (called the
   adiabatic approximation in semiconductor theory), or is altogether
   unrestricted (requiring the full hydrodynamic model). It seems that
   significant temperature changes are likely to accompany current flow in
   the open ionic channel.}},

Abstract = {{High-n toroidal Alfven eigenmodes (TAEs) are studied on the basis of a
   kinetic model that includes full thermal ion finite Larmor radius
   effects, trapped electron collisions and fast particle instability
   drive. Lower kinetic TAEs (KTAEs) are shown to be non-existent in the
   nearly collisionless limit. Like TAEs, upper KTAEs are shown to exist
   because of thermal ion finite Larmor radius effects in the
   dissipationless limit. Dissipation effects on the stability of both TAEs
   and upper KTAEs can be treated perturbatively. However, owing to their
   extended mode structure in the ballooning space, upper KTAEs usually
   remain stable or weakly unstable even with large fast particle free
   energy. On the other hand, TAEs can be strongly destabilized. A new
   resonant TAE (RTAE) can be excited when the fast particle drive is
   significantly large. The RTAE is a beam-like mode, with its frequency
   determined mainly by the wave-particle resonance condition. The
   frequency of the RTAE can be much less than the TAE gap frequency and
   may be interpreted as the BAE observed in DIII-D experiments. As plasma
   beta increases, the TAE, RTAE and kinetic ballooning modes strongly
   couple; the TAE changes into the RTAE and eventually connects to the
   kinetic ballooning mode. Numerical results and analytical analysis on
   the stability of the RTAEs and KTAEs will be presented and compared with
   the TAE stability.}},

   The development of arthritis in SCID animals can be prevented by

   In addition, a vector engineered to express a polycystronic mRNA with
   TNF-R and the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSVtk) gene, while
   producing low levels of TNF-R, had a limited effect which could be
   blocked by treating the animals with ganciclovir. A retroviral vector
   expressing the HSVtk gene alone had no effect on this arthritis transfer
   model with or without ganciclovir. Serum levels of TNF-R did not
   correlate with clinical signs, however, lower anti-collagen antibody
   levels corresponded with lack of clinical symptoms. These results

   dehydrogenase/isomerase (3 beta-HSD) and cytochrome P450(scc) (cyt.
   P450(scc)) in the inner membrane and in the intermembrane contact sites
   of adrenocortical mitochondria. This observation raises the question of
   a possible functional association between the two proteins. Isolated
   bovine adrenocortical mitochondria are able to convert cholesterol to
   progesterone without the need of exogenous cofactors. An association of
   3 beta-HSD and cyt. P450(scc) is observed during the purification of 3
   beta-HSD from mitochondria. The behaviour of 3 beta-HSD on a column of
   Heparin-Sepharose is modified by the presence of cyt. P450(scc).
   Immunoprecipitations from mitochondria with either anti-cyt. P450(scc)
   or anti 3 beta-HSD antibodies result in a co-precipitation of the two
   proteins. Both proteins engaged in these immunocomplexes are
   catalytically active. The interaction was further demonstrated by the
   surface plasmon resonance method using purified components. An affinity
   constant of 0.12 mu M between 3 beta-HSD and P450(scc) was obtained.
   These observations suggest that P450(scc) and 3 beta-HSD may associate
   into a molecular complex in the mitochondrial compartment and may
   constitute a functional steroidogenic unit, thus opening new
   possibilities in the regulation of the production of progesterone and
   its flow in the adrenocortical cell.}},

   Recently, trisomy 7 has been identified in squamous cell carcinoma of

   squamous cell carcinoma with KA-like features (SCC-KA) (n=8) for trisomy
   7 by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) to determine if this
   chromosomal abnormality is unique to squamous lesions diagnosed as
   WDSCC, or shared by both KA and SCC. In addition, the pertinent
   clinical-histopathologic findings were summarized. Trisomy 7 was
   identified in one KA, one SCC-KA and two WDSCC. This study by KA and
   SCC, providing further evidence that KA is most likely a form of SCC.
   Further studies are required to determine if trisomy 7 in these lesions

Abstract = {{The response to parthenogenetic activation (calcium ionophore A23187) of
   bovine oocytes after 30 hr of culture in different maturation conditions
   was evaluated. The activation rates of oocytes in response to 10 mu M
   A23187 were similar (86\% +/- 4 vs. 89\% +/- 8) when the oocytes matured
   with or without cumulus cells were cultured in TCM-199 + 10\% fetal calf
   serum (maturation medium {[}MM]) alone. However, the activation rates
   were significantly lower in oocytes matured with than without cumulus
   cells (48\% +/- 10 vs. 79\% +/- 16; P < 0.05) when MM was supplemented
   with 0.5 mu g/ml follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), 5.0 mu g/ml
   luteinizing hormone (LH), and 1.0 mu g/ml estradiol-1 beta (E(2)). When
   oocytes with cumulus cells were cultured in different media, MM alone,
   MM + 0.5 mu g/ml FSH, MM + 5.0 mu g/ml LH, MM + 1.0 mu g/ml E(2), and MM
   + all three hormones, the percentages of activated oocytes were 91\% +/-
   3, 52\% +/- 14, 83\% +/- 7, 83\% +/- 13, and 54\% +/- 7, respectively.
   Oocytes with or without cumulus cells during culture began to form a
   pronucleus 5 hr after activation (5\% +/- 1 and 7\% + 1, respectively).
   Finally, the proteins synthesized by oocytes matured with or without
   cumulus cells before (3 hr) and after (10 hr) activation was labeled
   with {[}S-35]methionine for analysis. Before activation, a 47 kD protein
   complex was produced by cumulus cell-intact oocytes. An active protein
   synthesis of 60 kD was characteristic for the oocytes with cumulus cells
   cultured in MM containing 0.5 mu g/ml FSH. After activation, there was
   an appearance of proteins at 75 kD and 47 kD in the oocytes with cumulus
   cells but not in the oocytes without cumulus cells during the maturation
   period. These results indicate that bovine oocytes matured in vitro have
   different capacities for parthenogenetic activation depending on the
   presence or absence of cumulus cells and the presence of FSH in MM
   during culture. (C) 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a single-stranded DNA virus that can
   either integrate or replicate in host cells, Production of recombinant
   viral particles (rAAV) requires expression of the viral structural genes
   and the viral inverted terminal repeats in cis. By using an SV40
   replicon to amplify the structural genes, the yield of recombinant viral
   particles was increased 60-fold over a nonreplicating helper plasmid.
   The rAAV particles produced by this system have similar physical
   properties to wild-type particles, including buoyant density, size, and
   morphology. This novel rAAV packaging system was used to produce rAAV
   particles that contain the gene for the T cell co-stimulatory protein
   B7-2. Transduction of the human nonadherent lymphoid cell line LP-1 with
   these particles significantly increased the percentage of cells
   expressing B7-2 from 6.8\% to 78.0\%. Expression of B7-2 in the human
   lymphoid cell line RPMI-8226 was also substantially increased. Targeting
   of tumor cells grown in suspension was hampered by low-efficiency
   transduction using other viral or nonviral vector systems, Our new
   packaging system for recombinant AAV should allow generation of
   sufficient quantities of B7-2 containing particles to develop tumor
   vaccines for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of changing pH and electrolyte concentration on the
   dispersion and zeta potential of Na-and Ca-forms of kaolinite, illite
   and smectite was investigated in relation to changes in their net
   negative charge.
   The percentage of dispersible Na-clay and the percentage increase in net
   negative charge was positively correlated with pH, but the slopes varied
   from clay to clay. In general, the net negative charge was the primary
   factor in clay dispersion, and the pH affected clay dispersion by
   changing the net charge on clay particles. Na-smectite had larger net
   charge at all pHs than Na-illite and Nakaolinite, and it always had
   larger flocculation values. The role of electrolyte concentration could
   be due to its effect both on flocculation and variable charge component
   of the clay minerals. The zeta potential at different pHs also reflected
   the same trend of clay dispersion with net particle charge.
   In Ca-clays the trends were similar to Na-clays up to pH 7.0. In more
   alkaline solution CaCO3 formation led to charge reduction on clay
   particles, resulting in flocculation and reduction of zeta potential. At
   similar pHs the electrophoretic mobilities of all the clays showed
   constant potential behaviour. However, the zeta potentials of Ca-clays
   were always smaller than those of sodic clays because the clays were
   more aggregated. Net particle charge was the most important factor in
   controlling clay dispersion for the whole range of pH and ionic strength
   and for all types of cations.}},

   well as the ABS methods. By repeatedly applying the formula to reduce
   ranks, a biconjugation process analogous to the Gram-Schmidt process
   with oblique projections can be developed. This process provides a
   mechanism for constructing factorizations such as LDM(T), QR, and SVD
   under a common framework of a general biconjugate decomposition V-T AU =
   Omega that is diagonal and nonsingular. Two characterizations of
   biconjugation provide new insight into the Lanczos method and its
   breakdown. One characterization shows that the Lanczos algorithm (and
   the conjugate gradient method) is a special case of the rank-one
   process; in fact, these processes can be identified with the class of
   biconjugate direction methods so that history is pushed back by about
   twenty years.}},

Abstract = {{Excessive bilirubin levels in newborn infants result in long term
   neurologic deficits that remain after bilirubin levels return to normal.
   Much of the observed neurologic deficits can be attributed to
   bilirubin-induced, delayed neuronal cell death. Inhibition of
   calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaM kinase II1) activity that
   precedes cell death is observed in conditions such as seizure activity,
   stroke, and glutamate excitotoxicity. Because neonatal bilirubin
   exposure results in neuronal loss in developing brain systems, we tested
   whether bilirubin exposure would induce an immediate inhibition of CaM
   kinase II activity, in vitro. P-81 filtration assay of basal and
   calcium-stimulated kinase activity was performed under standard kinase
   assay conditions. Bilirubin and/or albumin was added to the reaction
   vessels to determine the effect of these agents on kinase activity.
   Bilirubin exposure resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of
   CaM kinase II activity (IC50 = 16.78 mu M). At concentrations above 50
   mu M, bilirubin exposure resulted in a 71 +/- 8\% (mean +/- SD)
   inhibition of kinase activity (p < 0.001, t test, n = 10). Bilirubin
   exposure did not results in kinase inhibition if excessive bilirubin was
   removed by albumin binding before stimulation of kinase activity (106.9
   +/- 8.6\% control activity, n = 5), However, removal of bilirubin by
   binding with albumin after calcium addition did not restore kinase
   activity, (36.1 +/- 3.8\% control activity, n = 5). Thus, once
   inhibition was observed, the activity could not be restored by addition
   of albumin. The data suggest that bilirubin exposure resulted in a
   calcium-dependent inhibition of CaM kinase II activity that, once
   induced, was not reversible by removing bilirubin by the addition of
   albumin, Because inhibition of CaM kinase II activity has been
   correlated with delayed neuronal cell death in many neuropathologic
   conditions, bilirubin-induced inhibition of this enzyme may be a
   cellular mechanism by which bilirubin exposure results in delayed
   neuronal cell death in developing brain.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Detection of subclinical recurrence after surgical resection
   of esophageal cancer would allow earlier treatment of recurrent disease
   and potentially offer a better outcome for rescue therapy.
   METHODS: The utility of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) assay was
   evaluated in the management of patients with esophageal cancer.
   RESULTS: Serum carcinoembryonic antigen was measured preoperatively in
   74 patients. Elevation of the CEA level (25 ng/mL) was present in 14
   patients (19\%). There was no relationship between preoperative CEA
   elevation and the stage of the tumor or the patients' survival.
   Eighty-three patients had CEA assay at regular followup intervals after
   resection. Objective evidence of recurrent disease was determined at
   similar intervals by chest radiography and abdominal and thoracic
   computed tomography scans. During follow-up, 53 of 83 patients developed
   recurrence. Postoperative elevation of CEA levels occurred in 32
   patients, resulting in a sensitivity of 55\% for detecting recurrent
   disease. Twenty-nine of the 32 patients who developed CEA elevation had
   objective evidence of metastatic disease. In 13 patients, the rise in
   CEA levels predated objective evidence of recurrence by a median of 4
   months (range 3 to 35), and in 16 patients, it occurred concomitantly.
   The specificity with which an elevated postoperative CEA level indicated
   recurrence was high, 90\%, with a positive predictive value of 91\%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative CEA elevation is highly predictive of
   recurrent disease. In 16\% of patients, elevation of CEA was the
   earliest objective sign of recurrence; such elevation should prompt
   consideration of adjuvant therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Tryptase, a mast cell serine protease, has been implicated in the
   pathophysiology of allergic asthma, but formal evidence to support this
   hypothesis has been limited by the lack of specific inhibitors for use
   in vivo. Therefore, in this study we examined the effects of two
   inhibitors of tryptase, APC 366
   {[}N-(1-hydroxy-2-naphthoyl)-L-arginyl-L-prolinamide hydrochloride] and
   BABIM {[}bis(5-amidino-2-abenzimidazolyl)methane] on antigen-induced
   early and late responses, airway responsiveness as measured by carbachol
   provocation, microvascular permeability as measured by bronchoalveolar
   lavage (BAL) albumin concentrations, and tissue eosinophilia from
   biopsies in allergic sheep. APC 366 and BABIM were administered by
   aerosol in all experiments. In vehicle control trials, antigen challenge
   resulted in peak early and late increases in specific lung resistance
   (SR(L)) of (mean +/- SE, n = 6) 259 +/- 30\% and 183 +/- 27\% over
   baseline, respectively. Treatment with APC 366 (9 mg/3 ml H2O given 0.5
   h before, 4 h after, and 24 h after antigen challenge) slightly reduced
   the peak early response (194 +/- 41\%), but significantly inhibited the
   late response (38 +/- 6\%, p < 0.05 versus control trials). Twenty-four
   hours after challenge, APC 366 also completely blocked the
   antigen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness to inhaled carbachol observed
   in the control trial. In the APC 366 trial, PC400 (the cumulative number
   of carbachol breath units {[}BU] that increased SR(L) by 400\%) was 22.3
   +/- 3.3 before and 22.6 +/- 3.6 BU after challenge as compared with the
   control trial where PC400 was 20.4 +/- 3.2 before and fell to 7.0 +/-
   1.5 BU after challenge (p < 0.05 versus baseline and drug treated).
   Similar results were obtained with BABIM (9 mg/3 ml) using the same
   treatment regimen. APC 366 also showed antiinflammatory activity by
   significantly inhibiting post antigen-induced BAL albumin and tissue
   eosinophilia when compared with control trials. Prophylactic
   administration of APC 366 (18 mg twice a day for 3 d plus 18 mg 0.5 h
   before antigen challenge) provided a significantly greater reduction in
   the early response (SR(L) 310 +/- 62 control trials and 100 +/- 10 drug
   treated, p < 0.05) as compared with the acute treatment. This multiple
   treatment regimen also blocked the late airway response and the
   postchallenge airway hyperresponsiveness as well. These results suggest
   that mast cell tryptase plays an important role in airway responses,
   including airway inflammation, to inhaled antigen. Inhibition of this
   enzyme may represent a new target for therapeutic intervention in the
   treatment of asthma.}},

Abstract = {{The incoherent second-order nonlinear light scattering in a
   macroscopically isotropic molecular liquid has emerged as a simple and
   widely applicable technique for the experimental determination of the
   first hyperpolarizability of nonlinear optical molecules in solution.
   The technique has become widely known as hyper-Rayleigh scattering.
   Until recently, electric-field-induced second-harmonic generation was
   the only solution technique to determine molecular
   hyperpolarizabilities. Apart from being more complex a technique, the
   applied field also limits its applicability to neutral and dipolar
   solutions. In this paper, we present the specific advantages of the new
   hyper-Rayleigh scattering technique and exemplify its wider scope with
   results from three different kinds of molecular materials: octopoles,
   biological chromophores, and quantum colloids.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Findings of pelvic relaxation have been reported in up to
   50\% of older adult female squirrel monkeys. To evaluate further the
   potential use of the squirrel monkey as an animal model of pelvic
   relaxation, we objectively observed and described the perineal findings
   of 160 adult females. The aim of this study was to examine the
   relationship of perineal findings to age and parity, factors thought to
   predispose women to pelvic relaxation.
   STUDY DESIGN: The urethra, cervix, and anterior and posterior segments
   of the vagina were evaluated. The degree of support loss at each site
   was documented. Genital measurements were obtained by previously
   reported methods. The findings were tested for association with elements
   of obstetric history, age, and subspecies.
   RESULTS: The females represented three subspecies and ranged from 3 to
   17 years old with parities of 0 to 10. The proportion of females with
   normal support was inversely related to increasing parity and age.
   Although birth weights, frequency of dystocia at term, and requirement
   for cesarean section did not differ significantly between females with
   and without evidence of prolapse, animals with multiple sites of
   prolapse tended to have infants with higher birth weights. Animals
   without prolapse were significantly younger and less likely to have been
   delivered of a term infant (p < 0.001). Subspecies differences unrelated
   to age or parity were found for each of the genital measurements.
   Differences were also found between animals with normal perineal
   findings and those with findings of prolapse. Animals with prolapse had
   shorter perineal bodies (p < 0.001), greater genital hiatal ratios (p <
   0.001), and wider genital hiatal measurements (p < 0.001). Females with
   abnormal pelvic findings were of increased parity (4.0 vs 1.6, p <
   0.001) and age (9.4 vs 6.3 years, p < 0.001) compared with those with
   normal pelvic findings.
   CONCLUSION: Analysis of genital prolapse in a large population of
   breeding squirrel monkeys demonstrated an association of loss of pelvic
   support with age and parity. A tendency for loss of support at multiple
   sites was associated with obstetric complications. These observations
   support continuing investigation into the nature and cause of
   spontaneous pelvic relaxation in this species and support the potential
   use of this nonhuman primate as an animal model.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of a constant magnetic field, applied at an angle psi the
   easy axis of magnetization, on the Neel relaxation time tau of a single
   domain ferromagnetic particle (with uniaxial anisotropy) is studied by
   calculating the lowest nonvanishing eigenvalue lambda(1) (the escape
   rate) of the appropriate Fokker-Planck equation using matrix methods.
   The effect is investigated by plotting lambda(1) versus the anisotropy
   parameter alpha for various values of psi, and the ratio h=xi/2 alpha,
   where xi is the external field parameter and lambda(1) versus psi for
   various h values (for rotation of the magnetization vector M both in a
   plane and in three dimensions). If M rotates in a plane the curve of
   lambda(1) versus psi is symmetric about psi=pi/4 in the range 0 < psi <
   pi/2 and significant decrease in tau with increasing psi is predicted
   for large xi and alpha. The maximum decrease in tau occurs at psi=pi/4
   whereupon tau increases again to the psi=0 value at psi=pi/2. For
   rotation of M in three dimensions, the curve of lambda(1) versus psi, (0
   < psi < pi) is symmetric about psi=pi/2. Thus the maximum decrease in
   tau again occurs at psi=pi/4 with maximum increase to a value exceeding
   that at psi=0 (i.e., with the field applied along the polar axis with
   that axis taken as the easy axis), at psi=pi/2 (field applied along the
   equator), the psi=0 value being again attained at psi=pi. The results
   are shown to be consistent with the behavior predicted by the Kramers
   theory of the rate of escape of particles over potential barriers. This
   theory when applied to the potential barriers for the equatorial
   orientation of the field for rotation in three dimensions yields a
   simple approximate formula for the escape rate which is in reasonable
   agreement with the exact lambda(1) calculated from the Fokker-Planck
   equation. Pfeiffer's approximate formula for the barrier height as a
   function of alpha {[}H. Pfeiffer, Phys. Status Solidi 122, 377 (1990)]
   is shown to be in reasonable agreement with our results.}},

Abstract = {{Studies into the partitioning of trace metals between the dissolved

   estuaries, the Mersey and the Humber. Aqueous phase trace metal
   concentrations were determined, along with partitioning data (K-p)
   determined from both laboratory equilibration experiments and by
   chemical leaching techniques.
   Dissolved trace metals in the Humber essentially exhibited conservative
   behaviour (or a slight positive deviation). In the Mersey, however,
   removal of zinc, chromium, and, in particular, copper and cadmium
   occurred in the low salinity region.
   Sequential extraction data gave an indication of the nature of trace
   metal bindings to suspended sediment, and revealed total extractable
   trace metals on the Mersey suspended sediment to be a factor of two
   greater than that found in the Humber. Similarly, partition coefficients
   in the Mersey were approximately an order of magnitude greater than in
   the Dumber, Chloro-complexation was shown to control the partitioning of
   cadmium within estuaries. Copper, however, exhibited a distinct trend of
   increasing K-p with increasing salinity.}},

Abstract = {{A glucose biosensor has been developed by entrapment of glucose oxidase
   in a polythianaphthene film formed onto a platinum surface. Glucose has
   been measured by H2O2 detection at +400 mV (vs. SCE). Electrochemical
   kinetic constants for the enzyme electrode have been calculated and
   indicated that in the unsaturated region the rate limiting step is the
   diffusion of the substrate through the polymer. The biosensor exhibited
   a linear response in the range 0.05-7.4 mmol/L with a response time of
   30-60 s and a relative standard deviation of 5.4\%. The presence of the
   film onto the electrode prevents the oxidation of interfering agents
   such as ascorbic and uric acid. The use of additional polycarbonate
   membranes onto the electrode surface extended the linearity of the
   response allowing the probe to be used in blood glucose analysis. The
   amount of glucose in two control sera was measured using the biosensor.
   Results correlated well with the glucose nominal values.}},

Abstract = {{Vascular endothelial cells (EC) play a key role in viral tropism in
   vivo. Since conflicting reports have been published on the capability of
   HIV to infect EC in vitro, we analyzed some factors potentially capable
   of influencing the susceptibility of human umbilical vein endothelial
   cells (HU VEC) to HIV-1. Both primary cultures and differentiated
   immortalized HUVEC lines were used. HUVEC were negative for the
   expression of CD4, but weakly CD26- and galactosylceramide-positive.
   Although binding of HIV to EC was substantial, the virus was apparently
   incapable of replicating in nonproliferating cultures. In resting
   cultures, the content of cell-associated HIV disappeared 4-6 days after
   infection without pro duction of p24 and infectious progency. In
   contrast, infection of proliferating EC cultures led to the transient
   release of p24 and infectious virus (10(2.5)-10(3.5) SFU/ml) peaking 2-6
   days postinfection. Antibody neutralization of cytokines that may be
   produced by EC (IL1, IL6, IL8, TNF, IFN-beta) failed to modify virus
   adsorption and replication, whereas treatment with IL1-beta plus
   TNF-alpha stimulated both virus binding and virus release. As seen by
   gag polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the viral genome persisted up to 15
   days in untreated EC cultures, but over 20 days in cultures exposed to
   IL1-beta plus TNF-alpha. This study shows that: (a) CD4-negative HUVEC
   are capable of binding substantial amounts of HIV-1; (b) binding is
   enhanced by proinflammatory cytokines; (c) the establishement of
   productive infection is favored by cell proliferation; and (d) exposure
   to IL1-beta plus TNF-alpha enhances virus replication. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{Aim - To determine whether the fluorescent in situ hybridisation
   technique (FISH) using a total human DNA genomic probe can be used to
   enumerate semen leucocytes.
   Methods - Semen samples from five donors were subjected to a mild KCL
   solution. These samples were then biotin labelled under FISH conditions
   using a total human DNA genomic probe and the leucocyte counts were
   determined. To check the accuracy of the technique a monoclonal antibody
   against the common leucocyte antigen CD45 {[}KC56(T-200)] sewed as a
   control. An isotypic control for {[}KC56(T-200)], the immunoglobulin
   {[}MsIgG1], served as a secondary control.
   Results - Semen leucocytes stained by the FISH technique were easily
   detected because of their distinct bright yellow colour, while the sperm
   cells were red. The leucocyte count ranged from 0.5 to 4.9 x 10(6) per
   mi of semen. KC56(T-200) and its isotypic control MsIgG1, which served
   as control for the FISH technique, accurately identified 94\% and 97\%
   of the semen leucocytes of a control donor, respectively.
   Conclusions - The FISH technique using a total human DNA probe can
   accurately and effectively enumerate the overall leucocyte population in
   semen.}},

   corresponding variables in healthy cows. The cows had a well-documented
   history of udder infection caused by major mastitis pathogens. Analysis
   of PMN functions revealed a deficiency in the luminol-enhanced
   chemiluminescence responses that seemed to be associated with the
   mobilization of myeloperoxidase (MPO) in the PMN of the patient group,
   as compared with the healthy controls. The migratory capacity of the PMN
   in response to a variety of chemotactic substances was enhanced in the
   patients. However, there were no significant differences between the two
   groups in the expression of surface-adhesion proteins (CD11a/CD18). It
   is proposed that the migratory activity of PMN cells was enhanced in
   order to compensate for their depressed respiratory-burst activity.
   Studies are under way to assess whether the defective mobilization of
   MPO in PMN of mastitis-prone cows is an acquired transient defect or a

   who were tested on both the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-hue test and the
   Color Screening Inventory. Analysis showed that inventory scores also
   predict continuous variations in and individuals' ability to
   discriminate colors, with an eta of .69, which explains 48\% of the
   predictive variance. It was possible to describe the data using a
   quadratic regression equation which has a corrected correlation of .52.
   Using this, a conversion table was generated to allow rapid estimation
   of 100-hue test scores from the inventory. On the basis of the results,
   the Color Screening Inventory appears to be a quick and effective means

   first childbirth, for some years after puberty, until the parents are
   better established as providers. Phimosis and preputial adhesions are
   common in human males because they have selective advantage, tending to
   impede and therefore delay the onset of sexual activity. The physical
   signs of female virginity have an analogous function, and have been
   selected for in the same way. This hypothesis also provides a consistent
   explanation for the worldwide tradition of circumcision and for the
   common practice of masturbation by human males.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine the influence of teenage smoking habits on
   nutrient intake, food choice and body size.
   Design: Data was collected cross-sectionally: smoking habits were
   evaluated by questionnaire; heights and weights were measured and
   dietary intakes were quantitatively assessed via 4-day unweighed dietary
   diaries.
   Subjects: The subjects studied (n = 3430) were participants in the 1970
   Longitudinal Birth Cohort, and were nationally distributed throughout
   Britain.
   Results: Male and female smokers consumed significantly (P < 0.005) more
   alcohol and less fibre, thiamin and vitamin C than occasional or never
   smokers. Male smokers also consumed significantly more fat when
   expressed as a percentage of energy intake, and significantly less
   non-milk extrinsic sugar (P < 0.01) and iron (P < 0.005) than occasional
   or never smokers. Regular and occasional female smokers consumed
   significantly (P < 0.005) less protein and calcium than never smokers,
   and regular smokers also reported lower intakes of zinc, selenium,
   riboflavin, carotene and folates (P < 0.005) and iodine (P < 0.01) than
   never or occasional smokers. Both male and female smokers were less
   likely to be consumers of puddings, biscuits and wholemeal bread, but
   were more likely (P < 0.005) to consume alcoholic beverages and coffee.
   Intakes of chips, alcoholic beverages and coffee were significantly (P <
   0.005) higher among smokers and intakes of puddings, fruit, fruit juices
   and breakfast cereals lower. Regular female smokers also consumed
   significantly (P < 0.005) fewer vegetables. Smoking habit did not appear
   to be related to body size in this cohort.
   Conclusion: The diets of teenage smokers, particularly teenage girls,
   appear to be significantly different to thsoe of non-smokers, but
   smoking was not related to body size. Lower intakes of antioxidant
   nutrients, fruits, vegetables and cereals by teenage smokers are of
   particular concern.}},

Title = {{Predicted pollen dispersal by honey-bees and three species of
   bumble-bees foraging on oil-seed rape: A comparison of three models}},
Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{829-841}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. Comparisons among animal pollinators of the spatial distributions of
   pollen that they produce have typically been made among morphologically
   disparate pairs of species. In contrast, we investigated the potential
   extent of pollen dispersal by honey-bees (Apis mellifera) and
   bumble-bees (Bombus lapidarius, B. pascuorum and B. terrestris) foraging
   in rows of oil-seed rape (Brassica napus cv Westar).
   2. We estimated the pollen carryover attributable to individual bees by
   using particulate fluorescent dye as a pollen analogue. Most of the dye
   was deposited at the first few flowers probed and smaller proportions
   were deposited up to the 20th successively probed flower. We found no
   significant interspecific differences in dye carryover mediated by
   individuals of A. mellifera, B. lapidarius and B. terrestris with
   respect to either the amount deposited or the rate of decline in
   deposition across successively probed flowers. We present evidence that
   the dye produced a reasonably good analogue of pollen transfer.
   3. Bees typically flew from one plant to another nearby in the same row
   and were strongly directional in their movements. Bee species differed
   significantly in their movement patterns, with B. terrestris having the
   greatest mean move length and directionality.
   4. We used three kinds of model (a numerical simulation and two
   different sets of diffusion-advection equations) to attempt to emulate
   bee movements. The predictions from all models were reasonably
   consistent with the observed bee movements, although the numerical
   simulation invariably made the most accurate predictions, particularly
   over the first few moves.
   5. Predicted bee movements were combined with least-squares models of
   dye deposition to estimate the spatial dispersal of pollen by each bee
   species. All models ranked the bees in the same order of decreasing
   effectiveness in dye dispersal: B. terrestris, A. mellifera, B.
   lapidarius, B. pascuorum, although, except for long-distance dispersal,
   there was only minor variation among the bee species in the predicted
   extents of dye dispersal (e.g. the models predicted that the median
   dispersal distance would be approximately two intervening plants
   irrespective of the species of bee). Overall, the consensus of the
   models' predictions is that most of the pollen from a source plant is
   deposited on immediate neighbours, but that long-distance pollen
   dispersal in this system extends over approximately 20-40 intervening
   plants from the originating plant, depending on the identity of the
   pollinator.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this study was to review our 10-year experience
   with carotid-axillary artery bypass in the treatment of occlusive
   lesions of the proximal subclavian artery.
   Methods: Our 10-year experience with 26 carotid axillary bypasses for
   occlusive disease of the subclavian artery was reviewed retrospectively.
   The review focused on the indication for the operation, the surgical
   technique used, and the development of immediate and late postoperative
   complications. Long-term bypass graft patency and clinical success were
   determined on the basis of information gleaned from the office records
   of all patients. Only three patients were lost to follow-up at 12, 36,
   and 38 months.
   Results: There were no operative deaths. Two patients had small cervical
   wound hematomas, and two others experienced transient symptoms of
   brachial plexus irritation, which subsided spontaneously. Permanent
   nerve or lymphatic complications did not occur. In a mean follow-up of
   47 months, carotid-axillary bypass graft patency was 96\%, and 88\% of
   the patients enjoyed symptom-free sustained clinical success.
   Conclusions: This retrospective review demonstrates that a
   carotid-axillary bypass constructed with ringed synthetic graft material
   tunneled under the clavicle performs well and can be considered a
   reasonable alternative to the more standard carotid-subclavian bypass
   for the same indications.}},

   protocol conducted in six right-handed subjects. Applied to
   single-subject data. HMSD reveals activation located in the left
   inferior frontal gyrus in three subjects (two in the pars opercularis,
   one in the pars triangularis), and in the pars opercularis of the right
   inferior frontal gyrus in one case, the latter being combined to a
   crossed cerebellar activation, Overall, single case results were
   consistent with the analyses of stereotactically averaged data. Despite
   a 2D implentation. HMSD detection performances of averaged data were
   better than that obtained with the 2D version of statistical parametric

   Disruption of the normal activity budget in the laboratory environment

Abstract = {{Recently Kellermann has presented evidence in favour of the Universe
   being at critical density (q(0) = 0.5), based upon the angular-diameter
   (theta) versus redshift (z) relation for a sample of 82 milliarcsecond
   radio sources. Relativistic beaming is important in such sources and
   therefore any flux-limited sample of them has a projected-size
   distribution that is biased. Here we investigate the effects of flux
   selection on the value of go derived using the theta - z method, and
   show that it can lead to a large shift in the implied value of go. Using
   the subset of those 59 sources from Kellermann for which information is
   available to us, we find that no useful bounds on the value of go can be
   derived. Finally, we carry out simulations to estimate the number of
   milliarcsecond sources needed to constrain go with reasonable error and
   comment upon the likelihood of such a sample being available in the
   forseeable future.}},

   method validation and application of methods to studies. The focus of
   selectivity testing should address the question: Above what level will
   interference significantly impact on study conclusions? Four key issues
   will be addressed: the statistical relevance of any selectivity test
   performed; a criterion for significant interference; experimental
   methods to establish selectivity; and criteria for acceptance.
   To ensure that compound integrity is maintained throughout the work-up
   process, statistically meaningful methods of stability evaluation which
   are associated with specific acceptance criteria are required. Suitable
   methods for evaluating stability of analyte and/or solutions of analyte,
   in process stability, processed sample stability, long term stability
   and freeze-thaw stability, as well as meaningful acceptance criteria,

Abstract = {{1. Using the whole-cell patch clamp technique, the voltage-gated

   2. The spinal neurons possessed a very fast Na+ current, which activated
   with time constants that ranged from 0.1 to 0.25 ms. It was also subject
   to rapid inactivation with time constants ranging from 0.3 to 8 ms. This
   current could only be fitted with Hodgkin-Huxley equations once the
   rapid inactivation that occurs by the time of the peak current had been
   taken into account.
   3. Xenopus embryo neurons also possessed a mixture of kinetically
   similar Ca2+ currents, which activated with time constants that ranged
   from 0.3 to 0.8 ms. Sometimes the Ca2+ currents showed very slow
   inactivation at more positive voltages (>20 mV). The Ca2+ current was
   modelled as a single non-inactivating current.
   4. As might be expected, the embryonic neurons possessed a mixture of
   outward currents that were hard to separate either pharmacologically or
   through differences in voltage dependence. The delayed rectifier seemed
   to consist of varying proportions of two currents: a fast-activating K+
   current (with time constants of activation ranging from 0.6 to 2 ms) and
   a slow K+ current (with time constants of activation ranging from 5 to
   25 ms). The slow current was occasionally seen in isolation.
   5. For the Ca2+, fast K+ and slow K+ currents the rate of deactivation
   was faster than would be predicted from the kinetics of activation. This
   was modelled by allowing the closing rate constant of the channels to be
   described by one of two different functions of voltage that between them
   covered the whole range of transmembrane voltage. Although this was done
   for empirical reasons, it could be interpreted to suggest that the
   channels have more than one open state and predominantly close from a
   state that is distinct from the one to which they originally opened.}},

Abstract = {{The isopycnal transport parameterization of Gent and McWilliams has been
   implemented in the GFDL ocean general circulation model, replacing the
   physically unjustifiable horizontal mixing of tracers. The effects of
   this parameterization are investigated in a global domain. A comparison
   of its results with those of the conventional horizontal diffusion shows
   substantial and significant improvements in several climatically
   important aspects of the ocean circulation. These improvements include a
   sharper main thermocline, cooler abyssal ocean, elimination of the
   Deacon cell as a tracer transport agent, zonally integrated meridional
   heat transport and surface heat fluxes in better agreement with
   observations, and better confinement of the locations where deep
   convection occurs. The sensitivity of the model to the magnitude of the
   horizontal and isopycnal diffusion coefficients is also studied, showing
   that the domain averages of potential temperature and salinity, the mass
   transport of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, and the meridional mass
   transport in the Northern Hemisphere all increase with decreasing
   diffusivity. The northward beat and freshwater transports also reveal
   significant sensitivities to these coefficients. In addition, the
   effects of spatially and temporally varying transport and of unequal
   values of the eddy-induced transport and isopycnal diffusion
   coefficients are examined.}},

Abstract = {{Spectroscopic analysis of X-ray emission lines from hot astrophysical
   plasmas. such as solar and cosmic X-ray sources, is a powerful tool in
   the determination of elemental abundances and temperature and density
   diagnostics of the emitting gas. This same analysis can be used to model
   high-temperature laboratory plasmas associated with magnetic and
   inertial confinement fusion as well as with the study of X-ray laser
   research. Accurate determination of atomic rates is crucial for a
   reliable analysis. Dielectronic recombination is the dominant
   recombination process for incompletely ionized plasmas. The rate
   coefficients for dielectronic recombination of several ionization stages
   of the astrophysically abundant element iron (Fe XVI-Fe XIX) are
   presented at the fine-structure levels of the n = 3 excited states at
   several temperatures. The rate coefficients are calculated for a
   Maxwellian electron distribution in a low-density corona approximation.
   The dielectronic recombination process involves a large number of doubly
   excited states of the recombined ions and computations of many radiative
   as well as autoionization rates from these states. In this calculation
   we include doubly excited states that are formed by the free electron
   captured up to very high Rydberg states and detailed calculations of all
   possible dipole allowed radiative transitions and all dipole as well as
   nondipole autoionization transitions. Transitions to excited states of
   the recombining ion from all open autoionization channels, which have a
   significant effect in reducing the rate coefficients (as presented in
   the works of Jacobs et al.), are also included in our calculations.
   These calculations were carried out in the isolated resonance
   approximation using the Hartree-Fock method with relativistic
   corrections (as described by Cowan). The dielectronic recombination rate
   coefficients were evaluated at many temperatures encompassing the range
   around the temperature of maximum abundance. These J-resolved data will
   be extremely useful for accurate ionization balance calculations for
   astrophysical as well as laboratory iron plasmas.}},

   the exponent of regular variation of the innovation distribution) based
   on <(phi)over cap>, provided that the ratio of the bootstrap sample size
   m and the original sample size n converges to zero. This result enables
   us to construct a totally nonparametric confidence interval for the
   autoregressive parameter. We also consider bootstrapping a normalized

   To obtain the bootstrap validity results, we develop a continuous

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND. Laser skin resurfacing is growing in popularity in both the
   professional as well as lay populations. Freehand delivery of impacts is
   relatively time consuming. Accurate and precise placement of impacts to
   avoid unwanted overlaping and the superimposing of multiple impacts is
   difficult.
   OBJECTIVE. To evaluate a new computerized scanning device, the
   computerized pattern generator (CPG), and to compare it with freehand
   delivery of multiple laser impacts over large areas.
   METHODS. Sixty-one patients were treated using the CPG by surgeons who
   are experienced with freehand laser resurfacing.
   RESULTS. CPG delivery provides move vapid resurfacing with more uniform,
   accurate, and precise distribution of impacts.
   CONCLUSION. Combining the CPG with the Ultrapulse laser is a valuable
   addition making the procedure faster and more controllable.}},

Abstract = {{A simple analytical elastodynamic model for interpreting impact tests on

   theoretical model, based on a mass spring dashpot analogue, are
   expressed in terms of simple equations; this facilitates their use in
   practice. The theoretical model is validated by comparison of its
   predictions with those obtained from the rigorous elastodynamic theory
   of the impact dynamics of discs on an elastic half-space. The
   theoretical predictions agree reasonably well with observed behaviour in
   laboratory and field tests, The model indicates the importance of
   inertial effects and identifies the factors which induce non-linear soil
   response, Suggestions for further refinement of the model are made.}},

Abstract = {{The Hairy/Enhancer of split/Deadpan family of basic helix-loop-helix
   (bHLH) proteins function as transcriptional repressors. We have examined
   the mechanisms of repression used by the Hairy and E(SPL) proteins by
   assaying the antagonism between wild-type or altered Hairy/E(SPL) and
   Scute bHLH proteins during sex determination in Drosophila melanogaster.
   Domain swapping and mutagenesis of the Hairy and E(SPL) proteins show
   that three evolutionarily conserved domains are required for their
   function: the bHLH, Orange, and WRPW domains. However, the suppression
   of Scute activity by Hairy does not require the WRPW domain. We show
   that the Orange domain is an important functional domain that confers
   specificity among members of the Hairy/E(SPL) family. In addition, we
   show that a Xenopus Hairy homology conserves not only Hairy's structure
   but also its biological activity in our assays. We propose that
   transcriptional repression by the Hairy/E(SPL) family of bHLH proteins
   involves two separable mechanisms: repression of specific
   transcriptional activators, such as Scute, through the bHLH and Orange
   domains and repression of other activators via interaction of the
   C-terminal WRPW motif with corepressors, such as the Groucho protein.}},

Abstract = {{The finding that the link between polymorphism at the vitamin D receptor
   (VDR) gene and rates of bone loss from the femoral neck In
   postmenopausal women is enhanced at low calcium intakes suggests that
   intestinal calcium absorption is a site of differential action of the
   VDR alleles. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D {[}1,25-(OH)(2)D] and its receptor
   mediate active calcium transport, the major mechanism of calcium
   absorption at low calcium intakes. We compared fractional calcium
   absorption in healthy late postmenopausal women with (bb) and without
   (BE) the BSM-1 restriction site. In 60 women (26 BB and 34 bb), we
   measured calcium absorption and plasma 1,25-(OH)(2)D after 2 weeks on a
   high (1500 mg/day) and 2 weeks on a low (<300 mg/day) calcium intake.
   The mean Ca-45 absorption indexes were similar in the two groups on the
   high calcium intake {[}19.01 +/- 1.12\% (+/-SEM)/L in BB and 20.45 +/-
   0.97\%/L in bb; P = 0.346] and differed significantly on the low calcium
   intake (20.57 +/- 1.10\%/L vs. 23.66 +/- 0.95\%/L; P = 0.044). Calcium
   restriction induced similar percent increases in plasma 1,25-(OH)(2)D,
   but the BB group had a smaller increase in the fractional Ca-45
   absorption index {[}7.8 +/- 3.8\% (+/-SEM) vs. 20.7 +/- 3.3\% in bb; P =
   0.016; increments adjusted for initial absorption value].
   In conclusion, compared to women with the bb variants, women with BB
   allelic variants of the VDR have reduced calcium absorption efficiency
   on low calcium intake, consistent with a functional defect in the
   intestinal VDR. The impact of this heritable difference is reduced at
   higher calcium intakes.}},

Abstract = {{According to XRD, DTA, geochemistry and electron microscopy data of a
   few selected samples, three categories of smectitic clay minerals occur
   in the Cenomanian and Turonian chalks sampled in several sections of
   northern France. The first one corresponds to detrital illite-smectite
   mixed-layers reworked from pedogenic blankets. The second category,
   characterized by crystalline overgrowths around detrital particles, is
   especially well-developed in slowly deposited sediments. The third
   category, located in thin marry horizons, corresponds to
   Cheto-montmorillonite derived from the submarine alteration of volcanic
   glass. Smectitic minerals having distinct origins may therefore occur at
   different levels of a given formation. From these examples, the
   smectite-rich clay sedimentation of the Late Cretaceous is tentatively
   explained by the combination of favourable factors induced mainly by
   highstand of the sea-level. The climatic conditions, the reduction of
   continental areas, the development of carbonate platforms and the
   decrease in sedimentation rates constitute the most relevant of these
   factors.}},

Abstract = {{Although there is growing interest in studies of teachers' actions and
   conceptions, little is known about content-related teaching problems
   arising in science classrooms. This article presents a case study of
   problems which can occur when teaching the topic of redox reactions to
   Grade 11 students. Two chemistry teachers, a senior and a junior
   teacher, were involved in the study. Their reflective comments on the
   teaching problems were also investigated. Research data were obtained
   from classroom observations and audiotaped recordings of classroom
   practice. After the lessons, we conducted semistructured interviews with
   the teachers. The teaching problems are reported in terms of teaching
   activities causing difficulties for students in considering new
   conceptions to be necessary, intelligible, plausible, or fruitful.
   Analyses of the teachers' comments on these teaching activities
   clarifies a number of reasons why they acted as they did. It can be
   concluded that teachers' scientific expertise is an important source of
   difficulties when teaching redox reactions. Implications for an
   improvement of current chemistry classroom practice and content-related
   teacher training are offered.}},

   a flexible peptide linker. Using Immobilized Metal Affinity
   Chromatography, the recombinant protein was purified from bacterial
   insoluble membrane fractions. After refolding of the bispecific protein.
   it was affinity-purified. As demonstrated by flow cytometry, both
   binding sites ale retained in the refolded protein. Retargeted

Abstract = {{As is well known, the determination of plutonium isotopes in the marine
   environment is of great importance to calculate the contamination due to

   In the last 20 years sea sediment cores have been collected in different
   areas of the Mediterranean Sea by four Italian research teams. The
   sampling depth ranged from 50 to 2800 m and the core lengths were 10-30
   cm. The radioanalytical procedures were based on plutonium separation by
   anion exchange resins or by extraction chromatography with
   Microthene-TOPO; plutonium electroplating was performed before
   alpha-spectrometry. The final chemical yields were determined by spiking
   with Pu-236 or Pu-242. In some cases Pu-238 could be detected. As far as
   the vertical profiles are concerned, no significant subsurface maxima
   resulted for the cores collected at greatest depth; on the contrary
   interesting peaks were found for cores collected at 50-100 m depth.}},

Abstract = {{We use Boulware's Hamiltonian formalism of quadratic gravity theories in
   order to analyse the classical behaviour of Bianchi cosmological models
   for a Lagrangian density L = R + beta(c)R(2) in four spacetime
   dimensions. For this purpose we define a canonical transformation which
   leads to a clear distinction between two main variants of the general
   quadratic theory, i.e. for L = R + beta(c)R(2) or conformal L =
   alpha(c)C(alpha beta mu nu)C(alpha beta mu nu) Lagrangian densities. in
   this paper we restrict the study to the first variant. For the
   Bianchi-type I and IX models, we give the explicit forms of the
   super-Hamiltonian constraint, of the ADM Hamiltonian density and of the
   corresponding canonical equations. In the case of a pure quadratic
   theory L = beta(c)R(2), we solve them analytically for the Bianchi I
   model. For the Bianchi-type IX model, we reduce the first-order
   equations of the Hamiltonian system to three coupled second-order
   equations for the true physical degrees of freedom. This discussion is
   extended to isotropic FLRW models.}},

Abstract = {{Major research questions in the held of social stratification and
   mobility deal with similarities and differences in the patterns of
   social mobility in space and time. Answers are typically given by means
   of regression or log-linear models. Kelley (1990) argues for the
   superiority of the former in detecting differences in bivariate
   correlations between two populations, and characterizes log-linear
   modelling of social mobility tables for contextual comparisons as a
   paradigm that has failed. In this paper we show that, other things being
   equal, log-linear models and OLS regression models have about the same
   statistical power provided that the statistical tests involved are based
   on the same number of degrees of freedom. This is true for detecting
   differences in linear as well as in non-linear relationships between two
   populations. Thus, there are no statistical grounds for choosing between
   OLS regression analysis and log-linear analysis. Kelley's substantive
   arguments against log-linear modelling in social stratification research
   can be matched by relatively new developments on multinomial logistic
   regression analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Transmission of the opAFPGHc gene construct from parental transgenic
   coho salmon to F-1 progeny has been observed. Just prior to first
   feeding, these offspring were found to fall into two distinct phenotypic
   classes on the basis of morphology and external colouration, One group
   possessed the normal brown colouration typical of coho salmon alevins,
   whereas the other had a distinct green colouration and showed signs of
   cranial deformities and opercular overgrowth. Polymerase chain reaction
   analysis revealed that green phenotype was correlated with the presence
   of the opAFPGHc gene construct, and thus colouration could be used to
   identify transgenic progeny, On this basis, frequencies of transgene
   transmission to F-1 progeny from four individuals ranged from 2.2 to
   18.9\%, while a fifth male produced no transgenic progeny. Prior to
   first feeding, the transgenic progeny were found to be 21.2\% heavier
   and 11.9\% longer than their non-transgenic siblings, suggesting that
   the expression of GH in early development can influence the rate or
   efficiency of conversion of yolk energy reserves. After 1 year of
   development of F-1 progeny, the atypical phenotype associated with
   overgrowth of cartilage in the cranial and opercular regions became
   progressively more severe and resulted in reduced viability.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction of the pea (Pisum sativum L.) lectin (PSL) gene into white
   clover (Trifolium repens L.) hairy roots facilitates nodulation by the
   nitrogen-fixing bacterium Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae, which
   normally nodulates pea and not white clover (C.L. Diaz, L.S. Melchers,
   P.J.J. Hooykaas, B.J.J. Lugtenberg, and J.W. Kijne {[}1989] Nature 338:
   579-581). Here, we show that PSL is functionally expressed in transgenic
   white clover hairy roots transformed with the PSL gene. PSL could be
   isolated from these roots by affinity chromatography. Immunoanalysis of
   PSL showed the presence of polypeptides corresponding to the PSL
   precursor and its beta subunits. In addition, we developed a highly
   sensitive localization technique based on specific binding of a glycan
   moiety of rat IgE to PSL. Similar to the situation in pea roots, PSL
   appeared to be localized on the external cell surface of elongated
   epidermal cells and on the tips of emerging and growing root hairs of
   transgenic white clover hairy roots. PSL was not observed on normal
   white clover roots and on hairy roots without the PSL gene. These
   results show that (a) in transgenic white clover hairy roots, PSL is
   correctly processed and targeted to root cells susceptible to rhizobial
   infection, and (b) like in pea roots, PSL is surface bound with at least
   one of its two sugar-binding sites available for (rhizobial) ligands.}},

Abstract = {{The feeding habits and nutritional state of the spiny lobster (Panulirus
   interruptus) were studied; 71 specimens, ranging from 57-132.2 mm
   cephalothoracic length, were collected on a seasonal basis in August and
   November 1986 and February and May 1987, in Bahia Tortugas, Baja
   California The index of relative importance, which combines the
   frequency and weight of the different components, was used to analyze
   the diet composition. The nutritional state was assessed by means of a
   condition factor, calculated by dividing the Individual total weight by
   the caparace length, and the reserve food index, which is the
   hepatopancreas weight divided by the individual total weight. Panulirus
   interruptus showed an omnivorous diet, changing from carnivorous to
   herbivorous or even scavenger, depending on the environmental
   conditions. The diet consisted mainly of gastropods, fish remains,
   decapods and red and brown algae. Seasonal variation was observed in the
   feeding patterns of both sexes. Apparently, this variation was
   associated with the fluctuations in the availability of food items and
   with the home range of each sex. The condition factor registered the
   maximum value during the winter (x = 407.7, s.d. = 30.27), whereas the
   reserve food index showed the lowest value in the spring (x = 1.55, s.d.
   = 0.48). The differences observed are apparently related to the
   reproductive stage and to the cyclical movements of the lobster
   population, from shallow to deeper waters, throughout the year.}},

Title = {{An experimental study of water and carbon dioxide solubilities in
   mid-ocean ridge basaltic liquids .2. Applications to degassing}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLOGY}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Degassing processes in basaltic magmas rich in both water and carbon
   dioxide can be modeled using the solubilities of the end-member systems
   and the assumption of Henry's law. Suites of vapor-saturated basaltic
   melts having a range of initial CO2/H2O ratios and erupted over a narrow
   depth interval will define negatively sloped arrays on an H2O vs CO2
   plot. It is important that all of the major volatile species be
   considered simultaneously when interpreting trends in dissolved volatile
   species concentrations in magmas.
   Based on measured concentrations of water and carbon dioxide in basaltic
   glasses, the composition of the vapor phase at 1200 degrees C that could
   coexist with a basaltic melt and the pressure at which it would be vapor
   saturated can be calculated. The range in vapor compositions in
   equilibrium with submarine basalts reflects the range in water contents
   in the melts characteristic of each environment. The ranges in the molar
   proportion of CO2 in vapor phases (X(CO2)(U)) calculated to be in
   equilibrium with submarine tholeiitic glasses are 0.93-1.00 for
   mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) 0.60-0.99 for glasses from Kilauea
   {[}representative of ocean island basalts (OIB)] and 0-0.94 far glasses
   from back-are basins (BABE). MORE glasses from spreading centers ranging
   from slow (e.g. the Mid-Atlantic Ridge) to fast (e.g. East Pacific Rise,
   9-13 degrees N) are commonly supersaturated with respect to CO2-rich
   vapor, resulting from magma ascent rates so rapid that magmas erupt an
   the sea-floor without having been fully degassed by bubble nucleation
   and growth during ascent. In contrast to the MORE glasses, volatile
   contents in submarine glasses from Kilauea are consistent with having
   been in equilibrium with a vapor phase containing 60-100 mol \% CO2 at
   the pressure of eruption, reflecting differences in average magma
   transport rates during eruptions at mid-ocean ridges and hotspot
   volcanoes.
   Degassing during decompression of tholeiitic basaltic magma is
   characterized by strong partitioning of CO2 into the vapor phase. During
   open system degassing, CO2 is rapidly removed from the melt with
   negligible loss of water, until a pressure is reached at which the melt
   is in equilibrium with nearly pure water vapor. From this pressure
   downward, the water content of the melt follows the water solubility
   curve. During closed system degassing, water and CO2 contents in
   vapor-saturated basaltic map mas will depend strongly an the vapor
   composition as determined by the initial volatile concentrations.
   Deviation from open system behavior, toward lower dissolved H2O and CO2
   saturation concentrations at a given pressure, will be greatest in melts
   having high total volatile concentrations and high CO2:H2O ratios.
   Closed system degassing of basaltic melts having the low initial H2O and
   CO2 contents typical of MORE and GIB, however, are similar to the open
   system case.}},

Abstract = {{The Sry gene functions as a genetic switch initiating testicular
   development of the indifferent mammalian gonad. The Mus musculus
   molossinus Sry open reading frame (ORF) encodes a 395-amino acid
   transcription factor (mSry) that specifically binds and bends DNA
   through its N-terminal HMG domain and activates transcription through
   its long C-terminal (residues 144-366) glutamine/histidine-rich
   activation domain. The M. m. domesticus Sry ORF encodes a highly
   homologous, truncated protein (dSry) of approximately 230 amino acids,
   and the molecular basis for truncation is a point mutation that creates
   an amber stop codon within the activation domain. The mSry protein
   activates transcription of a Sry-responsive reporter gene in HeLa cells,
   but dSry does not. Gene swapping and in vitro DNA binding experiments
   revealed that lack of transcriptional activation by dSry was not the
   result of polymorphisms within the first 137 amino acids of the protein.
   Direct analysis of the C-terminal glutamine/histidine-rich domain
   revealed that dSry lacked a functional transcriptional activation
   domain. Fusion of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain to the C-terminal region
   of mSry created a potent transactivator. By contrast, a similar
   GAL4-dSry protein exhibited severely reduced activity. Analysis of a
   series of C-terminal deletion mutants of the GAL4-mSry chimeric protein
   indicated that residues 263-345 of the glutamine/histidine-rich domain
   were necessary for high level transactivation. Furthermore, readthrough
   of the premature amber stop codon by transfer RNA suppression resulted
   in a strong GAL4-dSry transactivator. This demonstrated that the
   premature stop codon is the only polymorphism responsible for the
   inability-of the dSry glutamine/histidine-rich region to transactivate.}},

Abstract = {{The elemental composition of microorganisms varies widely with respect
   to the N, S, P and ash content as well as many trace elements depending
   on microorganism and growth conditions. As a consequence, the mass of 1
   C-mol of biomass can differ considerably from one microorganism to
   another. Experimental results show that sulfur is completely volatilized
   during combustion, so that the calculation of the mass fraction of
   oxygen is affected when S is not measured. However, its neglect does not
   seriously affect the elemental composition and the degree of reduction
   of biomass. Phosphorus is found in ash after combustion at the same
   degree of reduction as in biomass. Therefore, oxygen bound to it should
   be included in the elemental formula, so that the degree of reduction of
   biomass remains unchanged by inclusion of P into elemental formula. No
   external oxygen is incorporated into biomass during combustion and thus
   the measured ash fraction is correct.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the extent of biochemical changes in the zona
   pellucida (ZP) and cortical granule release in eggs failing to fertilize
   in IVF.
   Design: After insemination, unactivated eggs without two pronuclei (PN)
   were studied by high resolution microscopy and fluorescent probes to
   determine cortical granule density and meiotic stage. After ZP
   isolation, proteins from individual ZPs were biotinylated,
   electrophoresed, and visualized by western blots with
   avidin-chemiluminescence. Controls included mouse unfertilized and
   fertilized eggs and human germinal vesicle stage oocytes and greater
   than or equal to 3PN eggs.
   Setting: University medical center and hospital tertiary care IVF-ET
   program.
   Results: Many of the unfertilized eggs were in metaphase and had
   relatively low cortical granule densities indicative of cortical granule
   loss. Approximately one half of the ZPs showed evidence of biochemical
   hardening with a modification of a 90 to 100 x 10(3) molecular (weight)
   ratio (M(r)) ZP protein. The 3PN eggs had few cortical granules and
   their ZPs had a pronounced 90 to 100 x 10(3) M(r) modification that was
   not detected in germinal vesicle stage ZP controls.
   Conclusion: The observed changes in ZP biochemistry and cortical granule
   quantitation demonstrate that failed fertilization is frequently
   associated with spontaneous cytoplasmic, but not nuclear, activation. In
   affected eggs, these changes could prevent fertilization in routine IVF
   and in cases of reinsemination. The relationship of changes in the ZP
   and cortical granules to infertility and in vitro culture requires
   further investigation. The 90 to 100 x 10(3) M(r) ZP protein
   modification can be detected biochemically with 1/10 of a human ZP.}},

Abstract = {{Since electrostatic motors require very high voltages and do not exert
   great efforts on the usual dimensional scale, their design and
   optimisation are not well-known. But on the millimeter and micrometer
   scales, this kind of motor seems to present interesting qualities. The
   optimisation of electrostatic micromotors is generally based on the use
   of numerical finite element methods. Because of the numerous possible
   geometrical combinations, this type of optimisation takes a lot of time
   and must be reperformed for each application. In this paper, we present
   an optimisation of variable capacitance motors based solely on an
   analytical model of the stator/rotor capacity. For each application,
   this model allows determining the optimal geometrical dimensions of the
   electrostatic micromotor depending on the fabrication process used.}},

Abstract = {{Thermomechanical training was carried out on a newly developed
   Fe-20Mn-6Si-7Cr-1Cu shape memory alloy. It was observed that the
   effectivene:ss of thermomechanical training largely depends on the
   recovery annealing temperature and the pre-strain during training. Based
   on the analysis of the changes in critical stress for martensite
   formation, the critical stress for (lip deformation, the phase
   transformation temperatures and microstructural development during
   training, it was concluded that the mechanism of thermomechanical
   training is based on the following two factors: (1) lowering of the
   critical stress for martensite formation, making stress induced
   gamma-->epsilon transformation easier; and (2) decreasing the Af
   temperature and refining the epsilon martensite structure, thus reducing
   the energy barrier for the epsilon-gamma reverse transformation. The
   optimum thermomechanical training conditions have been determined for
   the alloy studied.}},

Abstract = {{Type II pulmonary epithelial cells in primary culture synthesize and
   deposit an extracellular matrix which has reciprocal biological effects
   on cellular differentiation. The present work establishes conditions for
   metabolic labeling of matrix constituents and for separation of cells
   from the associated matrix; it also defines matrix composition, which
   does not appear to change qualitatively between days 2 and 6 of primary
   culture. Type II cells synthesize and deposit a spectrum of radiolabeled
   components on the culture surface. These include fibronectin, laminin,
   type IV collagen, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, along with
   additional unidentified proteins. Few radiolabeled proteins in medium
   conditioned by type II cells bind nonspecifically to the culture surface
   in the absence of cells. Fibroblasts and macrophages, which may
   contaminate the primary cultures, do not appear to contribute
   substantially to the type II cell matrix. These results demonstrate that
   type II cells synthesize and deposit a complex multicomponent
   extracellular matrix. The work provides a basis for further
   investigations of bidirectional interactions between type II cells and

Abstract = {{A study was conducted on the arc and melting efficiency of the plasma
   arc, gas tungsten arc, gas metal arc, and submerged arc welding
   processes. The results of this work are extended to develop a
   quantitative method for estimating weld metal dilution in a companion
   paper. Arc efficiency was determined as a function of current for each
   process using A36 steel base metal. Melting efficiency was evaluated
   with variations in arc power and travel speed during deposition of
   austenitic stainless steel filler metal onto A36 steel substrates.
   The arc efficiency did not vary significantly within a given process
   over the range of currents investigated. The consumable electrode
   processes exhibited the highest arc efficiency (0.84), followed by the
   gas tungsten are (0.67) and plasma arc (0.47) processes. Resistive
   heating of the consumable GMAW electrode was calculated to account for a
   significant difference in arc efficiency between the gas metal arc and
   gas tungsten arc processes.
   A semi-empirical relation was developed for the melting efficiency as a
   function of net arc power and travel speed, which described the
   experimental data well. An interaction was observed between the arc and
   melting efficiency. A low arc efficiency factor limits the power
   delivered to the substrate which, in turn, limits the maximum travel
   speed for a given set of conditions. High melting efficiency is favored
   by high arc powers and travel speeds. As a result, a low arc efficiency
   can limit the maximum obtainable melting efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Prolactin (PRC) is well known for its stimulatory effects on various
   components of the immune response. Experimentally induced high levels of
   FRL have been shown to correlate with the worsening of several
   autoimmune diseases. In contrast, lowering PRL levels may protect from
   the autoimmune process. We investigated in both sexes of NOD mice a
   spontaneous model of autoimmune type 1 diabetes, the effects of two
   drugs, a dopaminergic agonist, bromocriptine (BRC, 10 mg/kg), which is
   assumed to inhibit PRL secretion, and a dopaminergic antagonist,
   metoclopramide (MCP, 5 mg/kg), which in contrast stimulates PRL
   secretion, on the incidence of diabetes, the severity of insulitis, and
   PRC and glucose levels. Chronic treatment of NOD mice with MCP slightly
   aggravated development of diabetes. The dopamine antagonist tended to
   accelerate the onset of diabetes in females and significantly increased
   the number of islets with peri-insulitis in both sexes. The weak
   deleterious effects exerted by MCF in NOD mice may be related to its
   stimulatory action on PRL release. Contrary to the expected results, the
   dopamine agonist BRC did not protect from autoimmune diabetes. In
   contrast, the drug appeared to accelerate diabetes onset in males and
   significantly increased the number of islets showing insulitis in both
   sexes. This study underlines the complexity of the action of BRC which
   in NOD mice only transiently inhibits the release of PRL. Moreover, the
   aggravating actions of BRC may be related to the marked hyperglycemic
   effect of the drug observed in male and female NOD mice. (C) 1995

   shearless conditions. It is assumed that aircraft induced turbulence has
   ceased. The exhaust plumes of aircraft are represented by line sources
   with Gaussian cross-sections. The stratification has been varied between
   0.006 s(-1) and 0.03 s(-1). The computed effective horizontal diffusion
   coefficient lies between II +/- 2 m(2)s(-1) and 21 +/- 4 m(2)s(-1),
   depending on the level of stratification. Likewise the vertical
   diffusivity ranges from 2.3 +/- 0.6 m(2)s(-1) to 0.37 +/- 0.04 m(2)s(-1)
   in the beginning of the diffusion process, and amounts almost
   independently of the stratification to about 0.15 +/- 0.01 m(2)s(-1)
   later on. The plume cross-sections increase with time and
   stratification. The scattering of the results for a given stratification
   reflects the action of decaying, anisotropic, and homogeneous
   turbulence. The results confirm very well data from recent in-situ
   flight measurements in the North-Atlantic flight corridor in the
   tropopause region.}},

Abstract = {{Different antibiotic classes vary considerably in their modes of action
   and hence in their effects on the bacterial cell. Flow cytometry was
   used to analyse E. coli cells treated with five antibiotics differing in
   their modes of action, The ratio of protein content, as measured by
   fluorescence, to forward light scatter (i.e., FL1:FSC) provided a simple
   and reliable way of detecting within 2 h of treatment antimicrobial
   activity at a 0.5 minimum inhibitory concentration, This ability to
   detect antimicrobial activity rapidly offers considerable advantages in
   drug research for the rapid detection of novel antimicrobials and may,
   with further development, find a use in the clinic for rapid
   susceptibility testing as an aid to the selection of therapy. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia type I was diagnosed in three
   unrelated families from Martinique (French West Indies), and linkage to
   the locus far spinocerebellar ataxia 2 (SCA2) was established
   Neuropathological findings in two patients were those of
   olivopontocerebellar atrophy without oligodendroglial cytoplasmic
   inclusions. Cerebellar ataxia was associated with hyporeflexia in 68\%
   of 31 examined patients, with slowed and/or limited eye movements in
   65\% and with dementia in. 29\%. No patients had optic atrophy,
   pigmentary retinal degeneration, spasticity or parkinsonism. Mean age at
   onset was 33+/-16 years, and onset before the age of 20 years was
   correlated with a move rapid and severe course of the disease. Movement
   disorders, oculomotor disturbances, sphincter disturbances and cognitive
   impairment were significantly more frequent in early than in late onset
   patients. This explains why the phenotype was strikingly different in
   one family, in which mean age at onset was much earlier. Comparison with
   previously described SCA2 families indicated similarities, such as
   reduced saccade velocity, supranuclear ophthalmoplegia and decreased
   reflexes, although phenotypic heterogeneity remains the outstanding
   feature of this disorder.}},

Abstract = {{The CD-ROM technology allows the production of multimedia works which
   costs far less than books do. The creation of Internet and the servers
   World Wide Web has the advantage of distributing those works world wide,

   The Teachers' Council of Radiology of France (CERF) and the French
   Society of Radiology (SFR) have opted to use these new media and these
   information highways to spread a part of their radiology teaching work.
   Iconocerf(TM) is a software program which allows to create, store, read
   and to exchange digitized radiological cases. It's available free of
   charge, within the CERF and SFR. The CD-ROMs Iconocerf-Medimag contain 3
   500 radiological files with 15 000 images, previously on the videodisc
   Medimag.
   The Server of the French Radiology is a W3 server which includes:
   the CERF directory,
   a guide for the teachers, the research workers and the students in
   Radiology and Medical Imaging.
   It also contains the teaching works on Radiology, and some Iconocerf
   clinical cases translated onto HTML. The aim of this project is to
   create an evaluation system for radiology. By using key words, this
   system allows to consult :
   radiological clinical cases, located on the server or on CD-ROMs;
   reference texts;
   and to have access to the experts' addresses to be able to send them
   eventually a difficult case through electronic mail.}},

Abstract = {{Anti-DNA autoantibodies are the hallmark of the autoimmune disease
   systemic lupus erythematosus. Although these antibodies are both
   diagnostic and pathogenic, little is known about their structures and
   the manner in which they recognize DNA antigens. To address the first of
   these points we have predicted the three-dimensional structures of 40
   monoclonal anti-DNA F(ab) fragments derived from lupus-prone mice. These
   antibodies were chosen to encompass several different autoimmune strains
   along with the known variable region gene families that encode anti-DNA.
   We find that the structures of the antigen binding regions of these
   antibodies fall into three main classes, irrespective of both the mouse
   strain and genetic origins of the antibody. Specifically, high-affinity
   anti-ssDNA appear to possess a narrow channel that is presumably used
   for ligand recognition, whereas the binding site on anti-dsDNA is an
   open surface that is large enough to accommodate a DNA duplex. These
   findings provide structural data to support the hypothesis that anti-DNA
   arise by DNA-driven B cell activation and clonal expansion. (C) 1995

Abstract = {{The RN46A cell line was derived from embryonic day 13 rat medullary
   raphe cells by infection with a retrovirus encoding the
   temperature-sensitive mutant of SV40 large T antigen (tsT-ag). The RN46A
   cell line is neuronally restricted and constitutively differentiates
   following a shift to nonpermissive temperature, Differentiated RN46A
   cells express low levels of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) but no
   detectable levels of serotonin (5-HT). Treatment of cultures with the
   adrenocorticotropic hormone peptide ACTH(4-10) up-regulates the
   expression of TPH immunoreactivity in differentiated RN46A cells, but
   5-HT synthesis requires initial treatment with ACTH(4-10), followed by
   partial membrane depolarizing conditions, Up-regulation of TPH by
   ACTH(4-10) is apparently due to activation of adenylate cyclase, whereas
   the increased 5-HT synthesis with membrane depolarization can be blocked
   with the voltage-sensitive Ca2+-channel blockers nifedipine and
   omega-conotoxin. ACTH(4-10) treatment also markedly up-regulates the
   expression of the 5-HT reuptake transporter, as do dibutyryl cyclic AMP
   and forskolin; chronic membrane depolarization has no effect on 5-HT
   reuptake. The expression of the high-affinity 5-HT1A receptor is
   increased threefold by ACTH(4-10) treatment during differentiation and
   fivefold by differentiation under partial membrane depolarizing
   conditions. Combining ACTH(4-10) treatment and membrane depolarization
   does not increase expression of the 5-HT1A receptor further. 5-HT
   release is constitutive in ACTH-treated RN46A cells and linked to
   spontaneous synaptic vesicle fusion in RN46A cells, Considered with
   previous results, these data indicate that multiple effecters, ACTH,
   brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and membrane depolarization, have
   both distinct and overlapping effects that regulate specific elements of
   the serotonergic neuronal phenotype during differentiation and
   maturation. (C) 1995 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

   healthy volunteers were used as controls, studied once at rest. During
   the 2-tone task there was a bilateral posterior (occipito-) temporal and
   medial frontal activation, a left pericentral increase, and posterior
   cingulate suppression. During the 3-sound task activation was again
   found in posterior (occipito-) temporal, medial frontal cortex, left
   pericentral, with a small non-significant reduction in posterior
   cingulate uptake. Compared with the 2-tone task, there was a trend
   towards higher activity in left medial frontal, right posterior temporal
   and posterior cingulate cortex in the 3-sound task. P3b amplitudes were
   negatively correlated with posterior cingulate tracer uptake during both
   tasks. Positive correlations with P3b amplitudes were found in various
   frontal and temporal regions. These results are consistent with more
   invasive localisation studies of P3b. Posterior cingulate cortex appears
   to be inhibited during the oddball tasks, the more so, the more
   restricted the range of stimuli, and the greater the task-related
   recruitment of neurones (P3b amplitude). As expected from its more
   frontal distribution, P3a amplitude was positively correlated with
   anterior cingulate tracer uptake, and negatively correlated with
   temporal cortical activity.}},

Abstract = {{Six percent of the FK5 stars of fundamental proper motion pass the
   convergent point test for membership in the IC 2391 supercluster if
   stars within 30 degrees of the convergent and anticonvergent points (sin
   lambda<0,5) and values of V-TOT < 25 km/s are dismissed and a tolerance
   of 0.1 V-TOT (0.1/sin lambda) is placed on tau/nu. One third of these
   stars are eliminated by the luminosity test, using calibrations of
   available photometry, and an additional 40\% are removed by the
   imposition of the requirement that rho(Clus)-rho(Obs)<3 km/s. This
   leaves 1\% of the FK5 stars as supercluster members, which show a spread
   of about 10(7) yr, if 5x10(7) is the upper age limit of the early-type
   stars or 10(8) yr, if 5x10(7) is the minimum age. An age spread is also
   reflected in the lower main sequence stars. Interesting supercluster
   members include the spectroscopic triple HD 21364 (HR 1038), the
   ellipsoidal variable HD 1061 (UU Psc), the light variable HD 27290 (HR
   1338) which lies in the Bohm-Vitense decrement (BVD), the red variable

   underabundant and calcium, silicon, and helium overabundant, star HD
   143459 (HR 5959). The FK5 stars were also tested with the contrived

Abstract = {{A method based on the principles of dynamic programming is developed and
   applied to digital soil images to determine tortuosity, effective
   porosity, and the shortest paths available for flow. Pathways for flow
   are determined by minimizing a resistance factor. Analysis of two
   numerically simulated soils finds that a platy soil has greater
   effective porosity and smaller tortuosity than a layered soil. The
   ability of the dynamic programming model to analyse large digital images
   with complex pore structure is subsequently demonstrated by the analysis
   of a digital image of an agricultural soil. The results from the
   agricultural soil point to the need for digital soil image analysis to
   be three-dimensional if convective and diffusive soil properties are to
   be examined. It is demonstrated that, because determination of Row paths
   can be treated as a routing problem solved by applying a few simple
   rules, dynamic programming analysis is not limited by complexity of pore
   structures.}},

Abstract = {{One of the major concerns with detecting global climate change is the
   quality of the data. Climate data are extremely sensitive to errant
   values and outliers. Prior to analysis of these time series, it is
   important to remove outliers in a methodical manner.
   This study provides statistically derived bounds for the uncertainty
   associated with surface temperature and precipitation measurements and
   yields a baseline dataset for validation of climate models as well as
   for a variety of other climatological uses. A two-step procedure using
   objective analysis was used to identify outliers. The first step was a
   temporal check that determines if a particular monthly value is
   consistent with other monthly values for the same station. The second
   step utilizes six different spatial interpolation techniques to estimate
   each monthly time series. Each of the methods is ranked according to its
   respective correlation coefficients with the actual time series, and the
   technique with the highest correlation coefficient is chosen as the best
   estimator. For both temperature and precipitation, a multiple regression
   scheme was found to be the best estimator for the majority of records.
   Results from the two steps are merged, and a combined set of quality
   control flags are generated.}},

Abstract = {{Gravid females of Lucilia cuprina (Wiedeman) in a laboratory cage
   orientated positively to samples of fleece. Newly-wetted fleece was
   significantly more attractive than dry fleece, an effect resulting from
   the action of water on the fleece and not just addition of water vapour
   to the volatile fleece kairomones. Fleece contaminated with serous
   exudate, resulting from myiasis by L. cuprina, was much more attractive
   than wet, uncontaminated fleece from the same sheep. Kairomones from
   wetted fleece consistently augmented the attractive effects of
   2-mercapto-ethanol and indole in separate experiments, and of hydrogen
   sulphide (released from saturated aqueous sodium sulphide solution) in
   one trial out of three, but not overall. It is suggested that volatile
   fleece kairomones play a part in eliciting orientation to sheep by
   gravid L. cuprina. Fleece kairomones may augment the efficacy of
   kairomones released by putrefactive conditions in the fleece, which are
   known to predispose sheep to fly strike. They may also provide an input

Abstract = {{In this report, we show that ionizing radiation (IR) at a clinically
   relevant dose (4 Gy) causes apoptosis in macrovascular and microvascular
   human endothelial cells. Treatment of irradiated cells with a low dose
   of bacterial endotoxin (LPS), similar to the levels observed in serum
   during endotoxemia, enhanced the rate of apoptosis, although LPS alone
   was unable to induce programmed cell death. The cytokine and endotoxin
   antagonist interleukin-10 (IL-10) reduced the rate of LPS + IR-induced
   apoptosis to levels obtained with irradiation alone. Using neutralizing
   antibodies against tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF), we could show
   crucial involvement of TNF in the LPS-mediated enhancement of IR-induced
   apoptosis. but not in the IR-induced apoptosis per se. However, further
   analysis strongly suggested the transmembrane form of TNF (mTNF), but
   not soluble TNF, to be accountable for the LPS-mediated cytotoxic
   effects. Studies with anatagonistic receptor specific antibodies clearly
   showed that TNF receptor type I (TR60) is essential and sufficient to
   elicit this effect. These findings are of potential clinical importance
   because they may disclose a relevant mechanism that leads to endothelial
   damage after radiotherapy or total body irradiation used for
   conditioning in bone marrow transplantation and that may thus contribute
   to transplant related complications, especially in association with
   endotoxemia or related inflammatory states. (C) 1995 by The American

Abstract = {{Reexamination of the hexapeptide GH-releasing peptide (GHRP-6)
   structure/function has lead to the development of four novel classes of
   compound that stimulate GH release. Each class is represented as
   follows: a pentapeptide, G-7039; a tetrapeptide, G-7134; a
   pseudotripeptide, G-7502; and a rigid cyclic heptapeptide, G-7203. The
   EC(50) values for these compounds, determined by GH dose-response curves
   using primary cultures of rat pituitary cells, were 0.18, 0.34, 10.6,
   and 0.43 nM, respectively. To demonstrate that these compounds were
   acting at the putative GHRP receptor, challenges were made using
   combinations that included GHRP-6 and GH-releasing hormone (GHRH). All
   four new classes further increased GH release in combination with GHRH,
   but not with GHRP-6. Homologous desensitization occurred after 45 min of
   exposure to the new compounds while the cells remained sensitive to
   GHRH. Somatostatin inhibited all of these compounds. Additionally,
   G-7039 elevated free calcium, as occurs with GHRP-6. All four classes
   elicited a robust GH release, a small increase in PRL, and no change in
   LH, FSH, ACTH, or TSH. We conclude that these novel compounds are potent
   and direct stimulators of pituitary GH release, with in vitro attributes
   that suggest mediation via a specific GHRP-like mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is aimed at determining the number of screws and the
   dimensions of the appliance components of a hip nail-plate screw implant
   such that their sizes are a minimum (i.e. the implant weight is
   minimum), without the stresses in the appliance components as well as in
   the bone shaft exceeding the allowable limits. The implant-bone
   structure is idealized as a hybrid frame, composed of appliance
   components and the supporting femur bone elements, which act integrally
   to support the maximal load (during the gait cycle) at the hip joint.
   For various configurations of the implant, entailing different numbers
   of screws, the optimization technique is employed to determine the size
   of the members (nail, plate and screws) for a lightweight design.
   Implant configurations are analyzed for two, three, four and five nail
   configurations. The analysis of the hybrid (implant femur) frame, during
   each integrative object function and design parameter evaluation, is
   done by the Finite Element Method. The optimization problem is solved by
   the sequential unconstrained minimization technique (with the
   introduction of interior penalty function terms). It is found, from the
   results of analyses of the four hybrid frames, that the appliance frame,
   with two screws, yields the minimum-weight structurally safe design.}},

Abstract = {{Ten field tests were conducted to determine if the suppression of
   Fusarium crown and root rot of asparagus by NaCl was associated with
   changes in the densities and characteristics of root-colonizing
   bacteria. A total of 1,114 strains of root-colonizing bacteria were
   isolated from NaCl-treated and nontreated feeder roots (80 to 200 per
   test) and rated for their ability to reduce Mn on a Mn-dioxide medium,
   for UV fluorescence, and for antagonism against Fusarium oxysporum and
   F. proliferatum. In addition, bacterial densities on roots, levels of Mn
   in roots, and marketable yield were measured. In seven out of 10 tests,
   NaCl-treated roots had a greater percentage of Mn-reducing bacteria than
   control roots. Overall, the combined data revealed a significant
   increase in the small fraction of Mn-reducing bacteria on NaCl-treated
   roots compared to control roots (P = 0.006). In five out of six tests,
   roots from NaCl-treated plots had an average of 19\% more Mn per gram of
   root than roots from control plots (P = 0.08). The NaCl treatment did
   not affect the densities of bacteria on roots or the percentage of
   strains that were antagonistic to the Fusarium spp. The percentage of
   strains that fluoresced under UV light on King's B medium was
   significantly higher in half of the tests and, overall, was significant
   at P = 0.097. Fluorescent pseudomonads were more likely to be
   Mn-reducing strains than were nonfluorescing bacteria (P = 0.019).
   Twenty-eight out of 30 Mn-reducing strains were Pseudomonas spp. (64\%
   fluorescent pseudomonads) and two were Serratia spp. Only seven out of
   20 Mn-reducing strains suppressed disease on asparagus transplants in
   greenhouse tests. The disease-suppressive strains of Serratia spp. and
   P. corrugata were associated with higher levels of Mn in the roots of
   asparagus transplants grown in noninfested soils than in nontreated
   roots, but there were other Mn-reducing strains that did not affect
   disease or Mn levels. The interrelationships among NaCl treatments,
   suppression of Fusarium crown and root rot, and increases in Mn-reducing
   rhizobacteria tended to support the hypothesis that increased Mn
   availability contributes to disease resistance in asparagus.}},

Abstract = {{Endurance exercise training reduces glucose-stimulated insulin secretion
   while elevating insulin action on target tissues. Under some conditions,
   hormone action is enhanced by pulsatile delivery to tissues. We tested
   the hypothesis that different insulin secretory pulse profiles would be
   observed in endurance-trained vs. sedentary men. Seven endurance-trained
   {[}T; maximal O-2 consumption 62.5 +/- 4.3 (SD) ml . kg(-1). min(-1))]
   and seven untrained (UT; maximal O-2 consumption 40.3 +/- 3.3 ml .
   kg(-1). min(-1)) age- and weight-matched men were studied. All subjects
   had normal oral glucose-tolerance tests; however, the insulin responses
   for the T subjects were significantly lower than for the UT subjects (P
   < 0.05). After 2 days of no exercise and an overnight fast, arterialized
   venous blood was sampled at 1-min intervals for 120 min and assayed for
   insulin. Characteristics of the insulin pulse profile were quantified
   with deconvolution analysis. The mass of insulin secreted per burst was
   significantly lower for the T than for the UT subjects (50.1 +/- 14 vs.
   107.4 +/- 35 pM; P < 0.05), as was the peak height per burst (14.3 +/- 5
   vs. 37.5 +/- 3.2 pM), rate of insulin production (429.6 +/- 161 vs.
   1,002.4 +/- 393 pmol/90 min), and mean plasma insulin concentration
   (32.2 +/- 17 vs. 53.7 +/- 35 pM). The interpulse interval between bursts
   and the half-duration of insulin secretory bursts were not significantly
   different between the groups. Nonpulsatile basal insulin secretion was
   similar for the T and UT subjects (3.58 +/- 1.6 vs. 5.55 +/- 2.3
   pM/min). These data show that regular endurance exercise in young men is
   associated with an insulin pulse profile in the resting fasted state
   characterized by less insulin secreted per burst but a similar number of
   bursts over a 90-min period. As a working hypothesis, we suggest that
   training-induced elevations in target-tissue sensitivity to insulin
   reduce the requirement for pulsatile insulin secretion.}},

   in male Lewis rats with adjuvant arthritis were studied following
   once-daily oral administration of these drugs for 21 days. All the drugs
   dose-dependently inhibited hind paw swelling. For equal activity against
   hind paw swelling caused by the secondary reaction, the required daily
   dose of piroxicam was about twice that of meloxicam; those of diclofenac

   and cartilage destruction induced by adjuvant arthritis were inhibited
   by meloxicam at low daily doses and by piroxicam at doses approximately
   four times those of meloxicam. Diclofenac and tenidap had only a wreak

   produced similar effects, at 3-4 times higher doses. Diclofenac and

Abstract = {{The effect of {[}H+] on the rate of glycolysis was investigated in
   glioma C6 and fibroblast BHK-21 cells and in synaptosomes from rat
   brain. The rates of lactate production at an extracellular pH (pH(e)) of
   6.2, 7.4, and 7.8 were correlated with intracellular {[}ATP], {[}ADP],
   and {[}P-i] ({[}ATP](i), {[}ADP](i), and {[}P-i](i), respectively) and,
   when relevant, creatine phosphate (PCr) as well as with the levels of
   several glycolytic intermediates. In C6 cells cytosolic {[}H+] was
   measured simultaneously together with {[}Ca2+], {[}K+], {[}Na+], and
   membrane potentials. In all three systems studied, an increase in
   {[}H+](e) suppressed whereas a fall enhanced the rate of lactate
   generation. Changes in pH(e) produced no simple correlation between the
   amount of lactate formed and alterations either in the absolute {[}ATP],
   {[}ADP], {[}P-i], and {[}PCr] or their ratios but did correlate with the
   levels of glycolytic intermediates. Higher {[}fructose-1,6-bisphosphate]
   and {[}glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate] and lower {[}glucose-6-phosphate] and
   {[}fructose-6-phosphate] accompanied faster glycolytic activity,
   Addition of rotenone markedly enhanced glycolysis at all pH(e) values
   studied. The increases were larger at higher {[}H+] so that the rate of
   lactate generation was only slightly lower at pH 6.2 than at 7.4 or 7.8.
   With rotenone present, {[}ATP] (and where relevant {[}PCr]) fell and
   {[}ADP] and {[}P-i] rose under all pH(e) conditions. Simultaneously
   {[}glucose-6-phosphate] and {[}fructose-6-phosphate] decreased whereas
   {[}fructose-1,6-bisphosphate] and {[}glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate]
   increased; the levels of the last two were similar at pH 6.2 and 7.4.
   Alterations in concentrations of cations other than H+ were small and
   unlikely to contribute to the regulation of glycolysis. It is concluded
   that (a) under intracellular conditions, in the presence of a high
   {[}ATP] and a low {[}ADP] and {[}AMP], a fall in {[}H+] powerfully
   inhibits phosphofructokinase; lactate production correlates with the
   levels of glycolytic intermediates. (b) A small decline in cellular
   energy state is sufficient to release phosphofructokinase inhibition by
   protons. (c) Once activated by the decrease in energy level, the
   steady-state glycolytic rate is dependent on other factors, such as
   glycolytic intermediates and enzymes.}},

Abstract = {{Amitriptyline caused decreased concentrations in rat plasma of the amino
   acids tyrosine and tryptophan, which are precursors to monoaminergic
   neurotransmitters, and also of those other large neutral amino acids
   (LNAAs) (valine, phenylalanine, leucine and isoleucine) with which
   tyrosine and tryptophan compete for the carrier-mediated transport from
   plasma into the brain.
   The various LNAAs were, however, not decreased to the same extent. Thus,
   the relative concentrations, calculated as the ratio of each one of them
   to the total concentration of LNAAs, were also influenced by
   amitriptyline. The relative concentrations of tryptophan were decreased
   while the relative concentrations of phenylalanine and leucine were
   increased. Those of tyrosine, valine and isoleucine were not influenced
   by amitriptyline. The relative concentrations of the LNAAs in plasma are
   considered to be of importance to how much of each of them that will be
   transported into the brain. Based on this assumption one would have
   expected that the amitriptyline-induced changes in the relationships
   between different LNAAs would have caused changes in their brain
   concentrations in accordance with their relative concentrations in
   plasma. However, amitriptyline caused decreased concentrations of all
   LNAAs in rat whole brain.
   This finding cannot be explained by altered relationships between the
   LNAAs but must be explained by other mechanisms. Nevertheless, this
   effect of amitriptyline on brain LNAA concentrations might be of
   importance to monoamine function.}},

Abstract = {{Deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) characterization was performed
   after forming iron silicides on silicon by a solid state reaction at
   450-850 degrees C. No deep levels were discovered in n-type silicon when
   the reaction took place on cleaned previously unprocessed wafers. When
   the silicide formation was applied to samples given a standard silicon
   oxidation procedure, two defect levels, correlated to the presence of
   iron, were detected by DLTS. None of the levels could with any degree of
   certainty be identified. The levels observed in n-type oxidized silicon
   had activation energies of approximately 0.30 and 0.33 eV. In p-type
   silicon a defect level appeared with activation energy of 0.40 eV both
   in chemically cleaned previously unprocessed and in oxidized silicon
   samples. The observed defect levels at 0.33 eV in n-type silicon and at
   0.40 eV in p-type silicon showed defect profiles with lower
   concentration towards the silicide/silicon interfaces. All observed
   traps both on n- and on p-type silicon were removed by prolonged
   annealing or increased annealing temperature. This suggests that the
   formation of iron silicides on silicon may be compatible with silicon
   integrated circuit technology when considering electrically active

Abstract = {{Dopa decarboxylase (DDC) is involved directly in the synthesis of
   dopamine and serotonin and indirectly in the synthesis of noradrenaline.
   The present study investigated two Danish families for linkage between
   manic depressive illness, a marker at the DDC locus which has been
   mapped to 7p11-p13 and 10 microsatellite markers covering chromosome
   7q11-p15. No evidence of linkage was found assuming a dominant or a
   recessive mode of inheritance. We have earlier reported evidence against
   linkage between manic depressive illness and tyrosine hydroxylase and
   dopamine beta-hydroxylase. Mutations of major importance in the genes
   encoding the three enzymes involved in the synthesis of dopamine and
   noradrenaline seem less likely in the families we have studied. Further
   investigations of genetic and other pathophysiological mechanisms in
   relation to the monoamine hypotheses for manic depressive illness are
   still of relevance. There is a need for further linkage and association
   studies as well as a search for possible mutations in the relevant genes
   involved in the monoaminergic pathways to clarify their possible role in
   the aetiology of manic depressive illness.}},

Abstract = {{Several authors have articulated the need for broader theories or models

   Development of these broader theories requires more information

   compulsive buying and eating disorders involving binge eating. Study 1
   found that women diagnosed as having binge eating disorder had
   significantly greater compulsive buying tendencies than nonbinge eaters
   of similar weight. Study 2 showed that compulsive buyers were more
   likely to have engaged in binge eating, had more symptoms characteristic
   of both binge sating disorder and bulimia nervosa, and were more likely
   to be clinically diagnosed as having an eating disorder than a matched
   control group.}},

Abstract = {{Cardiac responsiveness to beta-adrenergic stimulation changes with age.
   Developmental changes in expression of guanine nucleotide-binding
   coupling protein (G protein) subunits may account for these physiologic
   changes, We measured steady-state levels of mRNA encoding the
   alpha-subunit of the specific G protein that stimulates adenylyl cyclase
   (G(s) alpha) and three isoforms of beta-subunit of G proteins (G beta)
   in developing myocardium. Total RNA prepared from the right and left
   ventricles of fetal, neonatal, juvenile, and adult rabbits was
   size-fractionated, blotted, and probed with P-32-labeled cDNAs encoding
   rat G(s) alpha, bovine G beta-1, human G beta-2, and human G beta-3, For
   standardization, these blots were subsequently hybridized with a
   P-32-labeled cDNA encoding glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
   (GAPD). Two-dimensional densitometric analysis of autoradiographs was
   used to quantify relative hybridization intensities. An age-dependent
   decrease in mRNAs encoding G(s) alpha, G beta-1, and G beta-2 relative
   to mRNA encoding GAPD was observed in both ventricles, while G beta-3
   mRNA was not detected. At all ages studied, levels of G(s) alpha and G
   beta-1 mRNA were similar in the two ventricles. However, G beta-2 mRNA
   declined more in the left ventricle than in the right ventricle during
   maturation. Our results demonstrate developmental control in heart for
   mRNAs encoding several G protein subunits, In addition, differential
   declines in G beta-1 and G beta-2 mRNA in the right ventricle suggest
   that these G beta isoforms are regulated uniquely and may reflect
   functional roles for these G beta isoforms in different signaling
   cascades. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{In a pharmacokinetics context deconvolution facilitates the following:
   (i) Given data obtained after intravascular (generally intravenous)
   input one may estimate the disposition function; (ii) given the
   disposition function and data obtained after extravascular
   administration one may estimate the extravascular to vascular input rate
   function. In general if the data can be represented by the convolution
   of two functions, of which one is unknown, deconvolution allows the
   estimation of the unknown one. Attention has been given in the past to
   deconvolution and in particular to its nonparametric variants. However,
   in a population context (multiple observations collected in each of a
   group of subjects) the use of nonparametric deconvolution is limited to
   either analyzing each subject separately or to analyzing the aggregate
   response front the population without specifying subject-specific
   characteristics. To our knowledge a fully nonparametric deconvolution
   method in which subject specificity is explicitly taken into account has
   not been reported. To do so Ive use so-called `'longitudinal splines.''
   A longitudinal spline is a nonparametric function composed of a template
   spline, in common to all subjects, and of a distortion spline
   representing the difference of the subject's function from the template.
   Using longitudinal splines for input rate or disposition function one
   obtains a solution to the problem of taking subject specificity into
   account in a nonparametric deconvolution context. To obtain estimates of
   longitudinal splines we consider three different methods: (1) parametric
   nonlinear mixed effect, (2) least squares, and (3) two-stage. Results
   obtained in one simulated and two real data analyses are shown.}},

Abstract = {{Although both morphologic cerebral damage and cognitive dysfunction are
   known to occur in patients on chronic hemodialysis (CHD) their extent
   and possible relation have been rarely studied. We therefore performed
   magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and neuropsychological testing
   in 30 consecutive CHD patients (mean age 58 years; range 37-69) and in
   an equal number of asymptomatic volunteers matched for age, sex and
   major cerebrovascular risk factors. Twenty-four (80\%) of the CHD
   patients were demented according to the criteria of the Diagnostic and
   Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IIIR and their mean scores on the
   Mini Mental State Examination (22.9 +/- 4 vs. 27.9 +/- 1.4; p < 0.001)
   and Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (112.3 +/- 21.5 vs. 141.9 +/- 2.3); p <
   0.001) were significantly lower than those of controls. The brains of
   CHD patients showed significantly more atrophy on visual rating and
   semiquantitative morphometric measures. Multiple lacunes or confluent
   white matter hyperintensities predominated in 10 (33\%) patients, three
   showed territorial infarcts and two a combination of both. Clinically
   these findings were unexpected in almost half of individuals. Marked
   cognitive impairment was associated with more extensive enlargement of
   the third ventricle (5.8 +/- 1.8 vs. 7.3 +/- 2 mm; p < 0.04) and the
   temporal hems (3.5 +/- 1.6 vs. 5.1 +/- 1.8 mm; p < 0.02) but not with
   the presence of cerebral ischemic lesions or any difference in
   laboratory data. These results call attention to a very high rate of
   cerebral damage in individuals undergoing CHD and suggest brain
   degeneration of probably toxic-metabolic etiology to be associated with
   severe cognitive impairment of these patients.}},

Abstract = {{We performed a retrospective analysis of thirty-three consecutive total
   hip and knee (twenty-three hip and ten knee) revision arthroplasties
   during which intraoperative frozen sections were analyzed. Data for the
   study were collected by means of a review of the charts, radiographic
   analysis, and evaluation of both frozen and permanent histological
   sections. The frozen sections, of periprosthetic tissue at the
   bone-cement interface or the pseudocapsule, were considered positive for
   active infection if there were more than five polymorphonuclear
   leukocytes per high-power field in at least five distinct microscopic
   fields.
   All patients were available for follow-up, at an average of thirty-six
   months (range, seventeen to seventy-nine months) after the initial
   revision operation. The frozen sections from ten patients were positive
   for infection, and those from twenty-three patients were negative.
   Comparison of the results of the analyses of the frozen sections (both
   positive and negative) with those of the analyses of the permanent
   histological sections of similar tissue showed a correlation of 100 per
   cent (sensitivity, 1.00; specificity, 1.00; and accuracy, 1.00). Nine
   patients had positive intraoperative cultures, and all of them had
   positive frozen sections (sensitivity, 1.00). Of the twenty-four
   patients who had negative intraoperative cultures, twenty-three had
   negative frozen sections (specificity, 0.96). Of the nine patients who
   had positive intraoperative cultures, only two were found to have
   infection on intraoperative gram-staining. The surgeon's operative
   assessment regarding the presence of infection, compared,vith the final
   pathological diagnosis, demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.70, a
   specificity of 0.87, and an accuracy of 0.82.
   All ten patients who had positive frozen sections were managed with
   excision arthroplasty; six of them subsequently had reimplantation, and
   the excision was the definitive procedure in the remaining four. One
   patient who had had a delayed reimplantation had with an arthrodesis of
   the knee. In the group that had negative frozen sections, eighteen
   patients had a primary exchange revision arthroplasty and five had a
   delayed reimplantation. At the time of follow-up, one patient who had
   had a delayed reimplantation had radiographic loosening of the femoral
   component and was asymptomatic. One patient who had had a primary
   exchange arthroplasty was managed,vith a second revision because of
   aseptic loosening. There was no clinical recurrence of infection in any
   patient.
   The data indicate that analysis of frozen sections of periprosthetic
   tissue is a reliable predictor of the presence of active infection
   during revision joint arthroplasty. We recommend its use to
   differentiate aseptic from septic loosening.}},

Abstract = {{Intracellular polyamine pools are partially maintained by an active
   transport apparatus that is specific for and regulated by polyamines.
   Although mammalian transport activity has been characterized by kinetic
   studies, the actual protein itself has yet to be identified, purified,
   or cloned. As one approach to this problem, we attempted photoaffinity
   labeling of plasma membrane proteins using two specifically designed and
   synthesized polyamine conjugates as photoprobes. The first is a
   spermidine conjugate bearing the photoreactive moiety 4-azidosalicylic
   acid at the N-4 position via an alkyl linkage, and the second is a
   norspermine conjugate with 4 azidosalicylic acid at the N-1 position via
   an acyl linkage, Labeling of murine L1210 lymphocytic leukemia cells was
   carried out at 4 degrees C to promote selective alkylation of cell
   surface proteins, Separation of plasma membrane proteins from cells
   cross-linked with the N-4-spermidine conjugate by SDS-polyacrylamide gel
   electrophoresis revealed two heavily labeled proteins at similar to 118
   and similar to 50 kDa (designated p118 and p50, respectively). Band p118
   was more well defined and much more intensely labeled. Analogous
   proteins were also observed in human U937 lymphoma cells, Specificity of
   labeling was strongly suggested by competition with polyamines and
   analogs during labeling and further indicated by the nearly identical
   labeling of the same protein by the N-1-norspermine photoprobe but not
   by the unconjugated photoreagent. Neuraminidase pretreatment of L1210
   cells increased mobility of the p118, suggesting that it was
   glycosylated and, thus, of plasma membrane origin. In transport
   deficient L1210 cells, p118 and p50 were found to have a slightly higher
   molecular mass and were accompanied by a less distinct protein band
   (similar to 100 kDa), These findings indicate the presence of a poly
   amine binding protein at the surface of murine and human leukemia cells,
   which could be directly or indirectly related to the polyamine transport
   apparatus.}},

   recording was carried out with induction coils, MCG is now approaching
   the threshold of clinical use. During the last 5 years, in fact, there
   has been a growing interest of clinicians in this new method which
   provides an unrivalled accuracy for noninvasive, three-dimensional
   localization of intracardiac source. An increasing number of
   laboratories are reporting data validating the use of MCG as an
   effective method for preoperative localization of arrhythmogenic
   substrates and for planning the best catheter ablation approach for
   different arrhythmogenic substrates. In this article, available data
   from literature have been reviewed. We consider the clinical use of MCG
   to localize arrhythmogenic substrates in patients with
   Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and in patients with ventricular
   tachycardia in order to assess the state-of-the-art of the method on a
   large number of patients. This article also addresses some suggestions

Note = {{7th European Meeting on Hypertension, MILAN, ITALY, JUN 09-12, 1995}},
Abstract = {{Aim: Previous studies have demonstrated that the hypothalamus of the
   adult Milan hypertensive rat strain (MHS) contains a higher proportion
   of ouabain-like factor than Milan normotensive (MNS) controls. The
   present study was designed to demonstrate that the rat standard diet
   contains a ouabain-like factor similar to that extracted from rat tissue
   and to investigate the influence of low or high dietary ouabain-like
   factor content on tissue ouabain-like factor levels at different ages in
   MHS and MNS rats.
   Materials and methods: MHS and MNS rats were reared on two controlled
   batches of standard rat diet containing low (batch A 0.09 mu g/kg) and
   high (batch B 0.7 mu g/kg) concentrations of ouabain-like factor. The
   mothers of these rats had also been fed with the diet throughout
   pregnancy and lactation. The hypothalamic content of ouabain-like factor
   was measured in both strains at 21, 30 and 90 days of age by high
   performance liquid chromatography fractionation.
   Results: (1) The dietary ouabain-like factor content did not influence
   either the hypothalamic ouabain-like factor yield or systolic blood
   pressure, either in MHS or MNS rats. (2) As a function of age, the
   hypothalamic ouabain-like factor content was constant between 21 and 30
   days of age in MHS rats, and then decreased by 60\% at 90 days. In MNS
   rats, ouabain-like factor was decreased by 80 and 90\%, respectively, at
   30 and 90 days, compared to the age of 21 days. (3) At the age of 21
   days, MHS rats had 30\% lower levels of ouabain-like factor than MNS
   rats, but 60\% higher levels at 30 and 90 days.
   Conclusions: Hypothalamic ouabain-like factor and systolic blood
   pressure are not influenced by dietary ouabain-like factor, thus
   excluding a process of passive tissue accumulation. Different mechanisms
   regulate the age-dependent endogenous ouabain-like factor production and
   accumulation in MHS and MNS rats, suggesting that the maintenance of
   higher ouabain-like factor levels in MHS than in MNS at the age of 30
   and 90 days contributes to the development and maintenance of
   hypertension in this strain.}},

Abstract = {{This paper compares three insect inspired controllers which were
   implemented on an autonomous hexapod robot. There is a growing interest
   in using insect locomotion schemes to control walking robots.
   Researchers' interest in insect-based controllers ranges from
   understanding the biological basis of locomotion control in insects to
   building real-time walking machines which require relatively little
   computational power. Several models for insect locomotion exist, and
   robotics researchers tend to adopt one approach and experiment with it.
   In contrast, this paper offers a comparison of three insect inspired
   controllers - all of which were implemented and tested on the same
   autonomous hexapod robot. Some of the controllers used reflex-based
   mechanisms whereas others used pattern-based mechanisms. Reflexive
   controllers exploit sensory stimulus and response reactions to produce
   leg motion and gait coordination. In contrast, pattern-based controllers
   depend more upon pre-programmed patterns of behavior which may be
   influenced by external events. Typically, these pre-programmed patterns
   of behavior are implemented using central pattern generators (CPGs),
   In this work, we compare gait coordination performance of three
   controllers on flat terrain. We extend the comparison to include leg
   loading considerations, disabled leg compensation, and externally
   applied leg perturbations. We discuss the differences between
   controllers with respect to inconsistent leg retraction velocities, leg
   design issues, sensing requirements, and computational issues, The robot
   performed quite differently under varying experimental conditions
   depending upon which controller was used. We found that controller
   performance was the most sensitive to robot design parameters. For our
   case, we had the most success with pattern-based mechanisms given the
   leg design of our robot and its limitations in controlling the
   retraction velocity of its legs. The pattern-based mechanisms allowed
   the robot to remain stable over a variety of gaits while the robot was
   subjected to loading the legs, disabling a leg, and physically
   disturbing the legs. The reflexive mechanisms were less successful at
   maintaining stability when the robot's legs were increasingly disrupted.}},

Abstract = {{The absorptive surface of epithelial cells from chicken small and large
   intestine was studied at the day of hatch (1 d group) and at 2 and 6 wk
   after hatch. The segments considered were duodenum, jejunum, ileum,
   cecum (proximal, medial, and distal regions), and rectum. The length,
   diameter, and density of microvilli as well as cell apical diameter were
   measured in tip-villous enterocytes by transmission electron microscopy.
   The results obtained showed that during development: 1) microvillus
   length remained constant in duodenum and jejunum and decreased in the
   other segments; 2) microvillus diameter increased only in the jejunum
   and the rectum; 3) microvillus density increased in duodenum, ileum,
   distal cecum, and rectum (especially from 1 d to 2 wk) and did not
   change in the other segments; 4) cell apical diameter did not change; 5)
   apical surface area increased both in the duodenum (2nd to 6th wk) and
   in the jejunum (1 d to 2 wk) but did not change in the ileum. In the

   based on his own anatomical studies of 1958. Other authors have
   published their experience in wrist denervations with similar results,

   the wrist.
   We have studied the innervation of the wrist by dissection under
   magnification on 20 cadaver limbs and by histological examination of
   five human foetal wrists. Based in our anatomical findings, we have
   demonstrated that Wilhelm's technique does not achieve total denervation

Abstract = {{The performance of several genotypes of sorghum, corn, rice, and barley
   as adjunct material was investigated. The wort viscosity of waxy sorghum
   and waxy corn adjuncts was lower than that of floury or starchy sorghum,
   rice, and barley malt. The viscosity of sorghum adjunct worts varies
   from 1.42 cP for waxy endosperm to 1.48 cP for normal type endospem,
   much lower than the corresponding value for barley malt wort (1.56 cP)
   under the same conditions. Waxy and heterowaxy materials had shorter
   conversion times than did normal sorghum. Studies of starch
   characteristics shaw that sorghum starches gelatinize at around 72
   degrees C, whereas barley gelatinizes at about 60.6 degrees C. The waxy
   sorghum exhibited a lower gelatinizatian temperature (69.6 degrees C)
   and higher peak viscosity (114 relative viscosity units) than that of
   the normal sorghum. A significant correlation was found among
   gelatinization temperature and conversion time and wort viscosity.
   High-performance liquid chromatography analyses revealed that the sugars
   present in sorghum, corn, rice, and barley malt worts are fructose,
   glucose, maltose, maltotriose, and maltotetraose. Peaks corresponding to
   glucose and fructose were absent or at trace levels in the chromatograms
   of diluted worts (6.5 degrees P) of waxy and heterowaxy sorghum and of
   waxy corn, which seems to indicate that those adjuncts may produce a
   wort rich in complex carbohydrates and low in fermentable sugars.}},

Abstract = {{Two approaches of compartmental toxicokinetic modeling of gaseous
   compounds are presented which are suitable for kinetic analysis of
   concentration-time data measured in the air of closed exposure systems.
   The first approach is based on a two-compartment model with
   physiological gas uptake, the second on a physiologically-based
   toxicokinetic model. Both models can be used for the description of
   inhalation, accumulation, exhalation and metabolism of gaseous compounds
   together with the toxicokinetics of metabolites. Interspecies
   extrapolation is based on physicochemical, physiological and biochemical
   parameters. The advantage of the two-compartment model is its limited
   number of variables and its experimentally easy applicability. Its
   disadvantage is the impossibility to predict tissue specific
   concentrations. The advantage of the physiologically-based model is its
   usability for predictions and for the description of tissue specific
   concentrations. However, it entails great effort, since a series of
   parameters has to be determined before meaningful model calculations can
   be carried out.}},

Abstract = {{Ligands of the Delta/Serrate/lag-2 (DSL) family and their receptors,
   members of the lin-12/Notch family, mediate cell-cell interactions that
   specify cell fate in invertebrates and vertebrates. In C. elegans, two
   DSL genes, lag-2 and apx-1, influence different cell fate decisions
   during development. Here we show that APX-1 can fully substitute for
   LAG-2 when expressed under the control of lag-2 regulatory sequences, In
   addition, we demonstrate that truncated forms lacking the transmembrane
   and intracellular domains of both LAG-2 and APX-1 can also substitute
   for endogenous lag-2 activity. Moreover, we provide evidence that these
   truncated forms are secreted and able to activate LIN-12 and GLP-1
   ectopically. Finally, we show that expression of a secreted DSL domain
   alone may enhance endogenous LAG-2 signalling. Our data suggest ways
   that activated forms of DSL ligands in other systems may be created.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: This study examines the role of digital subtraction magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) of the breast in the interpretation of the
   morphology and characteristics of breast disease.
   Methods: Thirty-one patients with an abnormal mammogram or clinically
   palpable abnormality underwent MRI of the breast prior to surgical
   excision of the lesion. FLASH 3-D images of the breast were acquired
   before and after IV contrast injection of Gd-DTPA, Digital subtraction
   was performed on selected images, The images were independently assessed
   by two radiologists experienced in both mammography and MRI.
   Results: Accurate diagnosis was possible in 29 out of 31 patients using
   the subtraction technique compared to 23 cases using the pre-subtraction
   images alone. The actual extent of disease and multicentricity were also
   better appreciated on the subtracted image, Subtraction also provided
   better identification of tumour recurrence in the post-operative and
   post-radiotherapy breast, Chest wall and lymph node involvement were
   more easily appreciated on the subtraction images.
   Conclusion: Digital subtraction is a simple, effective and relatively
   cheap technique which can aid in the interpretation of magnetic
   resonance imaging of the breast.}},

Abstract = {{Native speakers of Mandarin who learn English as a second language (L2)
   frequently misidentify unreleased tokens of /t/ and /d/ in the final
   position of English words. The purpose of this study was to evaluate two
   training methods that might be used to increase Mandarin adults'
   accuracy in identifying such stops. Subjects were assigned to receive
   training using a two-alternative forced-choice procedure or a
   categorical same/different discrimination procedure. Small but
   significant increases in the percentage of correct identifications of
   /t/ and /d/ tokens were obtained for both groups of native Mandarin
   subjects, although their gains did not differ significantly. These gains
   were still evident for both groups 2 months after completing the
   training. The effect of training for both groups generalized to words
   that were not used in training. Contrary to the hypothesis that
   identification training promotes more robust long-term memory
   representations than same/different training, the magnitude of
   generalization observed for the two groups did not differ significantly.
   However, subjects seemed to maintain the effects of the same/different
   training better than the effects of the identification training. Taken
   together, the results obtained here challenge the view that
   identification training is superior to same/different training as a
   means for training novel phonetic contrasts.}},

Abstract = {{A fluorimetric assay which enables direct and accurate analysis of the
   adhesion of bacteria to solid particles was developed, The assay is
   based on labeling of the bacteria with fluorescamine, which reacts with
   primary amino groups on the cell surface to yield a yellow fluorescence
   that is easily detectable by both fluorescence microscopy and
   spectrofluorimetry, As an example, fluorescent labeling of Rhodococcus
   strain GIN-1 (NCIMB 40340) cells enabled the detection and quantitative
   determination of their adsorption to TiO2 and coal fly ash particles,
   Exposure of the cells to 10\% acetone during the labeling reaction
   affected neither their viability nor their ability to adhere to these
   particles, Only a small fraction (similar to 2\%) of the total cell
   protein was labeled by fluorescamine upon staining of intact bacterial
   cells, which may indicate preferential labeling of certain proteins,
   Specificity studies carried out with the fluorescence assay confirmed
   previous findings that Rhodococcus strain GIN-1 cells possess high
   affinities for TiO2, ZnO, and coal fly ash and low affinities for other
   metal oxides. In principle, the newly developed fluorimetric assay may
   be used for determination of cell adhesion to any solid matrix by either
   microscopic examination or epifluorescence measurements, In the present
   work, the adhesion of several other microorganisms to TiO2 particles was
   tested as well, but their ability to adhere to these particles was
   significantly lower than that of Rhodococcus strain GIN-1 cells.}},

Abstract = {{Ascending and descending efferent pathways from the nuclei of
   serotonergic neurones located in brainstem raphe nuclei project to all
   regions of the central nervous system. Therefore, in considering the
   major physiological roles played by this neurotransmitter system, it is
   not surprising that serotonin is implicated in the aetiologies of many
   CNS dysfunctions which underlie psychiatric and neurological disorders.
   The presynaptic serotonin uptake mechanism and the many receptor
   subtypes that mediate the neurotransmitter roles of serotonin have been,
   and continue to be, targeted by drug discovery programmes aimed at
   identifying improved therapies for CNS disorders. Here we review the
   radioligands available for the important task of visualizing and
   characterizing these targets in the living human brain using either
   positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission tomography
   (SPECT). Such studies are crucial for extending our knowledge of the
   involvement of serotonin neurotransmission in the aetiologies of these
   disorders and for the development of new and more effective therapies.
   Particularly important recent advances in the methodologies for imaging
   the 5-HT transports the 5-HT2A receptor and the 5-HT1A receptor will
   almost certainly lead to important clinical research into the changes
   occurring in serotonergic neurotransmission during the onset,
   progression and treatment of affective and neurodegenerative disorders.}},

Abstract = {{The right frontal quadrant of Hurricane Iniki crossed the southeast
   coast of Kaua'i on the afternoon of September 11, 1992 and produced
   marine overwash with excursion distances of approximately 20-250 m and
   elevations in the range 4-9 m (mllw). Using a combination of field data,
   empirical relationships, and theory, we estimate that the effective
   maximum sustained wind velocity (V-theta max) was in the range 52.4+/-2
   m/s. We also analyze the meteorological and oceanographic components of
   marine flooding under the right frontal quadrant of the storm. Overwash
   was principally a function of eye-relative position and orientation of
   the coast, tan theta (slope), the friction-controlled wave run-up, and
   the wave set-up. Maximum overwash was adjacent to a major bathymetric
   channel and a slightly embayed coastline which reduced wave-energy
   dissipation in the nearshore, affording greater landward translation of
   deep-water wave characteristics. Total combined calculated overwash on
   the south shore of Kaua'i at Kukuiula (similar to 5.2 m mllw) is the sum
   of pressure set-up (0.39 m), wave set-up (1 m), wind stress set-up (0.06
   m), run-up (2.9 m) and tidal stage (similar to 0.8 m). Measured
   debris-line and still-water mark elevations there ranged from 3.91-5.90
   m (mllw). To the east on the steeper Koloa Landing coast, the calculated
   overwash components equaled approximately 6.6 m (mllw), and measured
   debris-line elevations ranged from 6.84 to 9.16 m (mllw). We present and
   discuss maps of the Iniki debris line relative to the FEMA V-zone and
   100-yr flood zone, and major transportation arteries along the shoreline
   at five major coastal population centers on Kaua'i.}},

Abstract = {{Lymphotoxin (LT)-alpha beta heterotrimer is a membrane-anchored ligand
   expressed by activated T cells which binds specifically to the LT beta
   receptor (LT beta R), a member of the TN beta R family. The LT beta R is
   implicated as a critical element in controlling lymph node development
   and cellular immune reactions. To address this hypothesis we have
   isolated a mouse cDNA encoding a single transmembrane protein of 415
   amino acids with 76\% identity to human LT beta R. The receptor function
   of this molecule was demonstrated by the ability of the extracellular
   domain, constructed as a chimera with the Fc region of IgG1, to bind to
   LT alpha beta complexes expressed on the surface of activated T cells or
   insect cells infected with baculoviruses containing LT alpha and LT beta
   cDNAs. The gene encoding mouse LT beta R, Ltbr, contains 10 exons
   spanning 6.9 kb and maps to mouse chromosome 6, which is closely linked
   to Tnfr1, consistent with the tight linkage of the human homologue of
   these genes on chromosome 12p13. Mouse LT beta R mRNA is expressed by
   cell lines of monocytic and epithelial origin but not by a CTL line, and
   in vivo it is constitutively expressed in visceral and lymphoid tissues.
   The delineation of the structure of the mouse LT beta R will aid
   investigations into the role of this cytokine-receptor system in immune
   function and development.}},

Journal = {{ANNALS OF SURGERY}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{222}},

Abstract = {{Objective The authors' objective was to quantitatively assess
   angiogenesis or neovascularity within node-negative colon cancers and to
   determine ii increased angiogenesis correlated with higher recurrence
   and lower survival rates.
   Summary Background Data Neovascularization promotes rapid tumor growth
   by facilitating nutrient and metabolite exchange. Recent work with
   breast and nonsmall cell lung cancers has shown that low angiogenic
   activity imparts a lower risk of recurrence and metastasis. Although
   adjuvant therapy is beneficial for patients with node-positive colon
   cancers, no such benefit has been demonstrated for patients with
   node-negative lesions. Nevertheless, up to 30\% of this latter group
   will experience recurrence. We sought to identify a subset of patients
   with node-negative colon cancers at high risk for recurrence who might
   benefit from such therapy.
   Methods One hundred five node-negative colon cancers were immunostained
   for endothelial cell factor VIII-related antigen. Blood vessels within
   three microscopic fields at 100X magnification were counted, the mean
   calculated, and an angiogenesis score assigned. A subjective
   angiogenesis grade (1-4) was assigned after each slide was surveyed in
   its entirety. Score and grade were then assessed with respect to cancer
   recurrence and patient survival.
   Results Mean patient age was 71 years (range, 41-90 years) and mean
   tumor size, 516 cm (range, 2-12 cm). Mean follow-up was 6.5 years; mean
   angiogenesis score, 27.9 (range, 4-50); and mean grade, 2.0 (range,
   1-4). Patients living 5 years had significantly lower angiogenesis
   scores than did nonsurvivors (22.8 vs. 43.2, p = 0.0004). Each 10-vessel
   increase in score imparted a 2.0-fold greater hazard of death and a
   2.7-fold greater hazard of recurrence. The probability of surviving 5
   years is estimated by:
   P(survival)=e(2.6290-.0976.AS.)/1+e(2.6290-0.976.AS).
   and the probability of recurrence is estimated by:
   P(recurrence)=e(-3.5527+.08556.A.S.)/1+e(-3.5527+.08556.A.S.)
   Conclusions Angiogenesis within colon cancer is an important predictor
   of tumor behavior and may identify patients at higher risk for
   recurrence and early death.}},

Abstract = {{The paper focuses on methods for injecting prior knowledge into adaptive
   recurrent networks for sequence processing. In order to increase the
   flexibility needed for specifying partially known rules, a
   nondeterministic approach for modelling domain knowledge is proposed.
   The algorithms presented in the paper allow time-warping
   nondeterministic automata to be mapped into recurrent architectures with
   first-order connections. These kinds of automata are suitable for
   modeling temporal scale distortions in data such as acoustic sequences
   occurring in problems of speech recognition. The algorithms output a
   recurrent architecture and a feasible region in the connection weight
   space. It is demonstrated that, as long as the weights are constrained
   into the feasible region, the nondeterministic rules introduced using
   prior knowledge are not destroyed by learning. The paper focuses
   primarily on architectural issues, but the proposed method allows the
   connection weights to be subsequently tuned to adapt the behavior of the
   network to data.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A 103-cm core from a high arctic lake (80 degrees 49'N, 15 degrees 00'W)
   on Amdrup Land, NE Greenland has been analysed for pollen and other
   microfossils, as well as bulk samples from 10 cores for macrofossils.
   AMS C-14-dating of aquatic mosses (Drepanocladus exanmulatus and
   Scorpidium scoipioides) revealed that the lowermost 90 cm of the core
   was deposited during a 1.5-2 ka interval in the early Holocene, before
   the appearance of Salix aictica which immigrated to N Greenland c. 7 ka
   BP. Armeria scabra, now extinct in the area, larval cases and apotomes
   of Apatania zonella, today not known north of c. 77 degrees N, and other
   indices point to a climate warmer than that of today. A thin, sandy
   layer 13 cm below the lake bottom, accompanied by marked changes in the
   content of pollen and macrofossils, such as the sudden occurrence of
   large amounts of Salix pollen and leaves, indicates a large hiatus. This
   is confirmed by the dating to c. 7 ka BP of mosses just below the sand,
   and of Salix leaves just above it to c. 1 ka BP. The hiatus must be
   caused by sediment slumping which transported all the sediment from the
   intervening period to the deeper part of the lake. A similar, sandy
   layer in the uppermost 2-6 cm may be caused by younger, (sub-)recent
   slumping, or both may be the result of the same disturbance. The
   possibility of a reservoir effect causing too old C-14-ages for the moss
   is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Although hormone replacement therapy is an effective treatment for
   menopausal symptoms, it is contraindicated for some women with an
   increased risk of cancer. It has previously been shown that
   postmenopausal women with hot flashes have elevated levels of central
   sympathetic activation. We therefore developed a behavioral relaxation
   procedure that significantly reduced hot flash frequency, presumably
   through the reduction of central sympathetic activation. Twenty-four
   postmenopausal women with at least five hot flashes per day were
   randomly assigned to receive eight 1-h sessions of training in paced
   respiration or alpha-EEG biofeedback (placebo). Pre- and posttreatment
   assessments of respiratory parameters and measurements of plasma
   3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG; the main metabolite of brain
   norepinephrine), norepinephrine, epinephrine, and platelet
   alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors were performed. Ambulatory monitoring of
   skin conductance level and tidal volume (24 h) were used to assess the
   effects of treatment. Hot flash frequency declined significantly (p <
   0.001) for the paced-respiration group (9.5 +/- 1.4/day pre vs. 5.5 +/-
   1.5 post) but not for the placebo group. There were no significant
   changes in any biochemical measure. In addition to the decline in hot
   flash frequency, the 24-h pattern of skin-conductance level was
   significantly altered for the paced respiration group. Thus the effects
   of paced respiration training do not appear to be mediated through
   reduced sympathetic activation but do result in thermoregulatory changes
   over a 24-h period.}},

Abstract = {{Biophysical inversion oi remotely sensed data is con strained by the
   complexity of the remote sensing process. Variations in sensor response
   associated with solar and sensor geometries, surface directional
   reflectance, topography, atmospheric absorption and scattering, and
   sensor electrical-optical engineering interact in complex manners that
   are difficult to deconvolve and quantify in individual images or in time
   series of images. We have developed a model of the remote sensing
   process to allow systematic examination of these factors. The model is
   composed of three main components, including a ground scene model, an
   atmospheric model, and a sensor model, and may be used to simulate
   imagery produced by instruments such as the Landsat Thematic Mapper and
   the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer. Using this model, we
   examine the effect of subpixel variance in leaf area index (LAI) on
   relationships among LAI, the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically
   active radiation (FPAR), and the normalized difference vegetation index
   (NDVI). To do this, we use data from the first ISLSCP Field Experiment
   (FIFE) to parameterize ground scene properties within the model. Our
   results demonstrate interactions between sensor spatial resolution and
   spatial autocorrelation In ground scenes that produce a variety of
   effects in the relationship between both LAI and FPAR and NDVI.
   Specifically, sensor regularization, nonlinearity in the relationship
   between LAI and NDVI, and scaling the NDVI all influence the range,
   variance, and uncertainty associated with estimates of LAI and FPAR
   inverted from simulated NDVI data. These results have important
   implications for parameterization of land surface process models using
   biophysical variables such as LAI and FPAR estimated from remotely

Abstract = {{Oxygen plays an important role in cardiac function. Many methods have
   been applied to measure tissue oxygen tension (Po-2). Electron
   paramagnetic resonance (EPR) oximetry appears to have some significant
   advantages for use in the beating heart. This study presents the serial
   measurement of myocardial Po-2 by EPR oximetry in the isolated
   crystalloid perfused heart during changes of influent Po-2, coronary now
   rate, oxygen consumption and end-diastolic pressure. Baseline myocardial
   Po-2 was 198 +/- 12 mmHg (mean +/- S.E.). Myocardial Po-2 increased as
   expected with increased delivery (concentration or now) or decreased
   consumption. With increasing flow rate, myocardial Po-2 increased in a
   sigmoid Fashion. A critical now or pressure was reached when myocardial
   Po-2 rapidly increased to a higher level. Increased left ventricular
   end-diastolic pressure caused local vascular compression and resulted in
   a decrease of myocardial Po-2. Myocardial capillary density in the
   intact contracting heart was calculated to be 2300 +/- 110/mm(2), using
   local myocardial Po-2 and a cylindrical model for oxygen diffusion in
   tissue. Relative capillary density did not change with mild to moderate
   hypoxia, increased with increasing flow and increasing oxygen
   consumption and decreased with elevated diastolic pressure, We conclude
   that the application of EPR oximetry with LiPc to the isolated heart
   provides accurate and dynamic evaluation of local myocardial Po-2 in the
   contracting heart. Using various models of oxygen delivery and diffusion
   in tissue, these data may also be used to serially follow capillary
   density. (C) 1995 Academic Press Limited}},

Abstract = {{It is commonly thought that patients receiving exogenous glucocorticoids
   have suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and need
   high supplemental doses of exogenous glucocorticoids (so-called stress
   steroids) to meet the demands of operative stress, Several reports have
   suggested that clinically important suppression of the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is extremely uncommon and that the
   levels of glucocorticoids required for stress are much lower than
   previously believed.
   A prospective study of twenty-eight patients who had thirty-five major
   orthopaedic operations was conducted, No patient received stress
   steroids; they were given only the baseline immunosuppressive doses of
   glucocorticoids (mean dose, ten milligrams of prednisone), Clinical
   information (based on regular physical examinations for signs and
   symptoms of hypotension, myalgia, arthralgia, ileus, and fever) and
   laboratory data (serum sodium levels, eosinophil count, and
   twenty-four-hour urinary free-cortisol levels, determined at
   perioperative and non-stress postoperative time-periods) were obtained
   to document any evidence of adrenocortical insufficiency, There was no
   such evidence in amy of the patients, who were monitored during their
   entire hospitalization. The levels of twenty-four-hour urinary free
   cortisol showed that all patients had endogenous adrenocortical function
   and, when this information was considered together with the clinical
   outcome, it was concluded that this level of function was sufficient to
   meet the demands of operative stress.
   Adrenocortical insufficiency in patients who have orthopaedic operations
   without receiving supplemental stress steroids appears to be much less
   common than previously thought, While biochemical testing of the
   function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis may sometimes reveal
   evidence of adrenal insufficiency, these tests do not predict the
   clinical outcome and may be too sensitive to guide decisions regarding
   treatment, Supplemental exogenous stress glucocorticoids may not be
   needed to meet the demands of operative stress in these patients.}},

Abstract = {{Since the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident, a striking increase of
   thyroid carcinoma has been reported in children exposed to radiation in
   Belarus. Because of its unprecedented scale and its emotional
   implications, this finding has raised concern and called the attention
   of the scientific community to this major health problem. Although
   epidemiologically documented, a direct correlation between thyroid
   cancer and radiation exposure has not been definitely proven at the
   molecular level. On the assumption that ionizing radiation could cause
   specific and common cancer-associated genetic lesions, an analysis of
   oncogene activation and/or tumor suppressor gene inactivation would help
   to define radiation-induced thyroid carcinomas.
   Therefore, we have analyzed by different molecular approaches, including
   Southern blotting, DNA transfection assay on NIH-3T3 cells, and reverse
   transcription-PCR analysis, six papillary carcinomas from children
   living in the region of Belarus at the time of the Chernobyl nuclear
   accident to identify tumor-specific gene rearrangements of the
   protooncogenes RET and TRK, previously found activated in a tumor
   type-specific manner in papillary thyroid carcinoma. Using Southern blot
   analysis in four casts, we could detect specific rearranged bands
   indicating an oncogenic activation of RET that in three cases resulted
   in rearranged sequences provided by the same activating gene. Moreover,
   the DNA of the last three cases showed a biological activity in
   transforming NIH-3T3 cells after the DNA-mediated transfection assay,
   and the respective NIH-3T3 transfectants were found to express the
   oncogenic fusion transcripts.
   These results support the possibility that RET oncogenic activation
   could represent a major genetic lesion associated with thyroid carcinoma
   in children exposed to the Chernobyl nuclear accident.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the trend to equilibrium of solutions to the
   space-homogeneous Boltzmann equation for Maxwellian molecules with
   angular cutoff as well as with infinite-range forces. The solutions are
   considered as densities of probability distributions. The Tanaka
   functional is a metric for the space of probability distributions, which
   has previously been used in connection with the Boltzmann equation. Our
   main result is that, if the initial distribution possesses moments of
   order 2 + epsilon, then the convergence to equilibrium in his metric is
   exponential in time. In the proof, we study the relation between several
   metrics for spaces of probability distributions, and relate this to the
   Boltzmann equation, by proving that the Fourier-transformed solutions
   are at least as regular as the Fourier transform of the initial data.
   This is also used to prove that even if the initial data only possess a
   second moment, then integral(\textbackslash{}upsilon\textbackslash{} >

   --> 0 as R --> infinity, and this convergence is uniform in time.}},

   contradictory results in published reports have left questions about the
   fertility of these hybrids. We produced backcrosses between male
   diploid, male triploid, and female diploid F-1 At X Bn hybrids and both
   parental species. Additionally, half of the eggs from each cross were
   heat-shocked to induce second polar body retention. The hybrid nature of
   the F-1 broodstock and the backcross progeny was confirmed with protein
   electrophoretic analyses, including use of two loci (FDHG{*} and
   PGK-2{*}) heretofore unreported as diagnostic for these species. These
   crosses produced either nonviable or sterile triploid progeny,
   Introgression between the two species' genomes via hybridization appears

   function of white dwarf stars by a change of the gravitational constant
   during the life of the Universe. A decrease of G induces the expansion
   of the star and accelerates the cooling process. This effect has
   noticeable effects on the luminosity function and can be used to set
   upper bounds on the rate of change of G. The values of the derived upper
   limit depend on the adopted age of the galactic disc, the position of
   the cut-off of the white dwarf luminosity function, and the physics of
   cooling - such as the degree of previous stratification of the chemical
   constituents of white dwarfs and the phase diagram of the carbon/oxygen
   (C/O) mixture. For reasonable ages of the solar neighbourhood this
   method provides G/G less than or equal to -(1 +/- 1) x 10(-11) yr(-1) if
   previously stratified models are adopted and G/G less than or equal to
   -(3(-3)(+1)) x 10(-11) yr(-1) if the distribution of carbon and oxygen
   is assumed to be constant through the white dwarf. These values are
   comparable with the upper bound obtained from the binary pulsar, which
   is considered to be the best constraint on the rate of variation of the
   gravitational constant.}},

Abstract = {{This study deals with the design, trials and evaluation of a
   co-education programme at the Volvo Uddevalla plant in Sweden, Involving
   operators, manufacturing engineers and managers, the programme served as
   a support for the creation of a participatory ergonomics process,
   intended for continuous use at the plant, It consisted of a basic
   ergonomics knowledge package, and a dialogue model defining the roles
   and relations of actors involved, As a practical part of the programme,
   trial development projects were also carried out by the participants,
   The main and long term objective of the project was to start the
   participants cooperating in a continuous change and development process
   on the shop-floor.
   The outcome of the co-education programme was evaluated immediately
   after the first two regular courses, and, as a longterm follow-up, after
   seven subsequent courses shortly after the closing of the Uddevalla
   plant, The co-education programme was shown to be successful, Later on,
   the expertize of both operators and manufacturing engineers became
   obvious to everyone at the plant, and the cooperation between operators
   and manufacturing engineers increased steadily, The main conclusion
   drawn was that the co-education programme is a good starting point for a
   process of participation and industrial change work, However, in order
   to get a permanent impact, the whole organization must nurse and nourish
   the further development, and implementation of the process.}},

Abstract = {{Phase sensitive alternating current (AC) voltammetry with o-nitrophenol
   (ONP) as a probe is used asa simple nondestructive method for a rough
   characterization of organic substances in natural seawater samples. This
   is based on the measurement of the effects of adsorbed organic
   substances on the peak height and the potential of the ONP reduction
   peak. In this work further improvements are presented of the method
   which is achieved by introducing the measurement of the prepeak of ONP
   reduction obtained upon scan reversal. The height of the prepeak is
   extremely sensitive to the type of organic matter adsorbed on the
   mercury electrode at the pH of natural seawater. The ONP prepeak
   increases in the presence of adsorbed layers of negatively charged
   organic substances, such as humic and fulvic acids and proteins. In the
   presence of adsorbed polysaccharides of dextran type there is no
   increase of the ONP prepeak height. With increasing concentrations of
   the polysaccharides a small decrease of the prepeak is observed. The
   application of the method is demonstrated on different seawater samples
   from the north Adriatic sea.}},

Abstract = {{The nutritional implications of the purchase and consumption of
   reduced-fat foods at home were assessed in normal-weight, free-living
   consumers in a 6-week intervention study. Control (n = 14) and
   experimental (n = 15) subjects kept 4-day weighed food diaries to
   establish energy and macronutrient intake at baseline and experimental
   weeks 2, 4 and 6. The control group continued their habitual diet
   throughout the study whereas the experimental group used reduced-fat
   foods ad libitum in place of the traditionally high-fat counterparts
   that they usually consumed. All subjects purchased the majority of their
   groceries from the same food store and were reimbursed for a proportion
   of their grocery bill. Repeated-measures analysis of variance indicated
   that the experimental group, compared to the control group,
   significantly reduced their percentage of energy from fat (from 38.3 +/-
   1.8 to 30.4 +/- 1.7), but increased the percentage of energy from
   protein (p = 0.06) and carbohydrate (p = 0.019) such that changes in
   total energy intake were not statistically significantly different
   between conditions. Nevertheless, the experimental group lost 1.1 kg
   (while the control group gained 0.4 kg) in the first 4 weeks of the
   study, consistent with the observed reduction in energy intake, though
   no further body weight changes were seen in week 6. This study suggests
   that although use of reduced-fat foods may have short-term effects on
   energy balance, long-term sustained reduction in energy intake may be
   limited if this dietary strategy is used in isolation. (C) 1995 Academic

Abstract = {{The influence of endogenous viral (ev) genes on avian leukosis virus

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine short-term pituitary and ovarian hormonal
   responses to GnRH agonist (GnRH-a) administered during various phases of
   the menstrual cycle, in the absence of controlled ovarian
   hyperstimulation (COH), to determine its independent effect on hormonal
   parameters previously demonstrated to influence assisted reproductive
   technology cycle outcome.
   Design: Prospective, randomized, controlled crossover study of five
   regularly cycling women. The GnRH-a, leuprolide acetate (LA), was
   administered 1 mg SC daily for 5 days beginning on cycle day 3 (early
   follicular); 8 days post LH surge (midluteal); or 13 days post-LH surge
   (late-luteal).
   Setting: Clinical research unit at a tertiary care medical center.
   Main Outcome Measures: Serum gonadotropins (LH and FSH) and gonadal
   steroids (E(2), estrone {[}E(1)], P, A, and T) measured daily during
   GnRH-a administration begun in the early follicular, midluteal, or late
   luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Gonadotropin pulse amplitude and
   frequency were determined after frequent serum sampling on the 2nd day
   of GnRH-a administration in each treatment cycle.
   Results: Serum LH elevations, 4- to 10-fold greater than observed for
   FSH, did not differ by cycle day of GnRH-a initiation. Initial increases
   in FSH did not differ by cycle day, however, early follicular initiation
   resulted in a more pronounced suppression of FSH. Mean LH pulse
   amplitude and frequency increased to a similar extent in all three
   groups, however, FSH pulse amplitude and frequency varied significantly
   by cycle day of GnRH-a initiation. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone
   agonist initiated in the early follicular phase resulted in significant
   increases in E(2), E(1), and P levels compared with both midluteal or
   late luteal. Increases in serum androgens were significantly greater
   after early follicular and late luteal initiation as compared with
   midluteal GnRH-a initiation.
   Conclusions: Relative FSH suppression and marked androgen elevations in
   both late luteal and early follicular groups, which may have potential
   detrimental effects on oocytes of the developing cohort, suggest little
   advantage of late luteal or early follicular over midluteal initiation
   of GnRH-a for COH.}},

   adhesion molecule 1, ELAM-1) intercellular adhesion molecule 1, ICAM-1),
   and the intercellular relationships in the early phase of the disease.
   Methods. Quantitative immunohistochemistry and electron-microscopy were
   performed on specimens of five subjects, aged 45 to 63 years. These
   studies were repealed in two patients after treatment with topical
   corticosteroid (betamethasone valerate cream 0.1\%) and
   psoralen-ultraviolet A (PUVA).
   Results. The infiltrate consisted mainly of CD4+ lymphocytes and CD1a+
   dendritic cells. Electron-microscopic investigation showed typical
   lymphocytes and two distinct types of dendritic cells. In the very early
   phase of the disease the adhesion receptors LFA-1 and ICAM-1 were
   expressed in tensely by all infiltrating cells; the adhesion receptors
   ICAM-1 and ELAM-1 were expressed by endothelial cells. Close contact
   occured between lymphocytes and dendritic cells. After puva (120 J per
   cm(2)) and topical steroid therapy the infiltrate disappeared
   completely.
   Conclusions. These data suggest that a cell-mediated immune mechanism
   may be important in progressive pigmented purpura and that the early
   endothelial expression adhesion receptors may determine the pattern of
   organization of the pericapillary infiltrate.}},

   on coulombic interactions of charges at the interface. The second model
   is based on Healy's site binding model {[}4, 5]. The field effect at the
   oxide-electrolyte interface has been demonstrated experimentally as
   well. A silica capillary filled with electrolyte is employed as the
   oxide electrode. Application of an electric field across the length of
   the capillary and perpendicular to the wall of the capillary, at the

Abstract = {{In Drosophila melanogaster, most of the sperm stored in a female is
   often displaced by the sperm from a subsequent mating. The exact
   mechanism of sperm displacement in D. melanogaster is unknown. It is
   thought, however, that the process is mediated largely by the male
   accessory gland fluid that is passed to the female, with sperm, during
   mating. If a sperm incapacitation process is involved, a male's
   accessory gland fluid would have to be able to distinguish between self
   and nonself sperm, Otherwise a male would incapacitate his own sperm as
   well as the sperm already stored in the female. Accordingly, if
   displacement occurs by an incapacitation mechanism, a male should be
   able to displace his own sperm less than that of another male. This
   experiment investigated whether males differentially displaced stored
   sperm when it was their own as opposed to that of another male. Females
   were remated to the same or a different male that had been sterilised
   between matings, allowing the degree of displacement of first male sperm
   to be determined unambiguously. Although no differential displacement
   was observed, further evidence was obtained that sperm displacement is
   caused by accessory gland fluid. The results also suggest that sperm
   displacement is directed primarily against sperm stored in the seminal
   vesicle rather than the spermathecae.}},

Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{541-572}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Recent work in macroeconomics argues that imperfections in capital
   markets may lead to business cycle fluctuations by propagating
   relatively modest shocks. Evidence for such a mechanism (also known as
   the `financial accelerator') consists largely of firm-level studies
   showing that cash flow is an important predictor of investment. But this
   evidence is often viewed with skepticism because cash flow is also a
   good indicator of investment opportunities. In this paper, we develop a
   framework for estimating the extent to which the predictive power of
   cash how can be attributed to its role as a `fundamental' versus its
   role in alleviating credit frictions. For firms with access to
   commercial paper and bond markets, we find that the perfect capital
   markets model of investment can fully account for the role of cash flow.
   For firms with only limited access to capital markets (as indicated by
   lack of participation in public debt markets) however, investment
   appears to be `excessively' sensitive to fluctuations in cash flow.
   These results thus clarify the role of cash flow in investment equations
   and provide support for the existence of a financial accelerator.}},

Abstract = {{Women and women's issues have a place in sport psychology today, but

   contributions of Harris and other women sport psychologists have roots
   in earlier work in both psychology and physical education. Pioneering
   women psychologists conducted research and challenged sexist assumptions
   and practices since psychology's earliest days. At the same time,
   prominent women leaders developed women-oriented programs and
   contributed to the professional literature in physical education. Women
   and women's issues have a place in sport psychology today, but too often
   that is an `'other'' or special interest place. By taking steps to
   re-place women in history and by engendering current research and

Abstract = {{The present experiment was undertaken to verify if the demand of tissues
   for pteroylglutamic (folic) acid, evaluated by serum clearance and
   urinary excretion of folates, is different between multiparous dairy
   cows in late gestation (five gestating dry cows, 52.6 (so 8.4)d before
   parturition), and in early lactation (four lactating non-gestating cows,
   18.0 (so 5.9)d after parturition). On day 1 the cows received one
   intravenous (i.v.) injection of 50 mu g pteroylmonoglutamic acid/kg body
   weight (BW). Blood samples mere taken at 0, 5, 15, 30 min, 1, 2, 4, 8
   and 24 h after the i.v. injection. On day 3 the cows received one
   intramuscular (i.m.) injection of 0 3 mg pteroylmonoglutamic acid/kg BW.
   Blood and urine samples, as well as urine volume, were taken at 0, 1, 2,
   4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h after the i.m. injection. On days 5, 6 and 7 a
   daily i.m. injection of 0 5 mg pteroylmonoglutamic acid/kg BW was given
   in an attempt to saturate tissues with folates. Then the cows received
   one i.v. (day 8) and one i.m. (day 10) injection of pteroylmonoglutamic
   acid according to the same procedures described previously for days 1
   and 3. On day 12 plasma volume was determined. Before tissue saturation,
   serum clearance of folates during the 24 h following an i.v. injection
   was similar for gestating and lactating cows but after tissue saturation
   serum clearance was slower for lactating than gestating cows (stage x
   saturation, P = 0.04). The percentage of folates excreted in urine was
   not affected by the physiological stage (P greater than or equal to 0.6)
   or the level of tissue saturation (P greater than or equal to 0.5). In
   conclusion, serum clearance and urinary excretion of pteroylmonoglutamic
   acid seem to support the hypothesis that, in multiparous cows, although
   there are no deficiency symptoms, tissue demand for folic acid is high,
   especially during gestation.}},

   protein (IP-10), was previously shown to be closely related to the onset
   of clinical signs ofmurine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
   (EAE). Chemokine mRNAs accumulated in a striking, transient burst within
   astrocytes, near inflammatory leukocyte infiltrates. It remained unclear
   if chemokines functioned to initiate leukocyte entry into CNS tissues,
   or to amplify the intrathecal inflammatory reaction. To address this
   issue, wt determined the expression of chemokine mRNAs at the earliest
   evidence of CNS immune-mediated inflammation. For these experiments,
   mice were sacrificed in pairs al varying times after immunization. Only
   one member of each pair was symptomatic for EAE at the time of
   sacrifice. Symptom presence correlated well with histological
   inflammation at the time of sacrifice. RNA was prepared from two CNS
   sites, brain and spinal cord, and expression of chemokine mRNAs was
   analyzed by a sensitive and quantitative reverse
   transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction dot-blot hybridization assay.
   CNS expressions of MCP-1 and IP-10 gene were correlated tightly with
   histological inflammation; indeed, chemokine expression was never
   detected in the absence of leukocyte infiltrates. In situ hybridizations
   showed that astrocytes expressed chemokine transcripts. These findings
   provide new information about mechanisms controlling chemokine mRNA
   expression during immune-mediated inflammation in EAE and are consistent
   with a role for chemokines as amplifiers of CNS inflammatory reactions.

Abstract = {{We propose a method to analyse competing risks survival data when

   a standard proportional hazards structure for each of the failure types,
   and involves the solution to estimating equations. We present consistent
   and asymptotically normal estimators of the regression coefficients and
   related score tests. An appealing feature is that individuals with known
   failure types make the same contributions as they would to a standard
   proportional hazards analysis. Contributions of individuals with unknown
   failure types are weighted according to the probability that they failed
   from the cause of interest. Efficiency and robustness are discussed.

Abstract = {{Na channel gating parameters in a number of preparations are translated

   rather, develop rapidly on excision with stationary kinetics thereafter.
   Average currents were constructed from single-channel records from
   neuroblastoma N1E 115 at various times after excision, excluding the
   first 5 min, in eight inside-out excised patches. Single exponentials
   were fitted to the current decay of the average records, and the mean
   time constant for each patch was determined. Values were plotted as the
   percentage difference from these means for each patch against time from
   excision. Collected results show no obvious trend in values from 5 min
   to 2 h. Kinetics are stationary, and shifts in Na channel gating
   parameters along the Voltage axis seen in excised as compared to whole
   cell configuration in neuroblastoma must be complete by the first few
   minutes after excision. Raising the internal Na concentration reduced
   the single channel current amplitude, confirming that these are Na

Abstract = {{A preliminary analysis was made of ionospheric slab thickness, tau, and
   total electron content, TEC, for southern Australia using GPS satellite
   measurements. It was found that at mid-latitudes tau has similar overall
   diurnal, seasonal and latitudinal variations in the southern hemisphere
   as in the northern hemisphere. However, there are appreciable
   differences between tau in the two hemispheres which would justify
   appropriate modifications to ionospheric models based on northern
   hemisphere data before being applied confidently to the southern
   hemisphere. The usefulness of GPS satellites together with ionosondes
   over a spread of latitudes was demonstrated in determining long-term
   variations of TEC and tau over a large area. It was concluded that as
   few as four GPS receivers could provide TEC for the whole of Australia
   in real-time, though approximately six receivers in convenient locations
   would be required in practice.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines phenotypic plasticity in relation to rearing density
   in larvae of the moth, Mamestra brassicae. Larval phase, growth rate,
   weight at moulting and susceptibility to disease were quantified when
   reared at five densities. Larvae develop more quickly, but attain a
   smaller size and are more susceptible to disease, when reared at high
   than at intermediate densities. They also exhibit a higher degree of
   melanisation than larvae reared at intermediate densities, or singly. A
   review of the literature suggests that a switch to a rapidly developing
   dark phase at high densities is a widespread phenomenon within the
   Lepidoptera. Rapid development at the expense of attaining a large size,
   and increased melanisation, are interpreted as adaptive responses to
   reach pupation before food supplies are depleted, as is likely when
   larval density is high. High susceptibility to viral infection at high
   density may be a result of physiological stress associated with rapid
   development, or due to a shift in allocation of resources from
   resistance to development: larvae that developed quickly were more
   susceptible to infection. Larvae reared singly appeared to be less fit
   than larvae reared at intermediate densities: they exhibited many of the
   characteristics of larvae reared at high density, particularly low
   weight, a right-hand skew in their weight frequency distribution, and
   high susceptibility to disease. I hypothesise that expression of
   resistance may be phenotypically plastic with regard to environment.
   Contact with other larvae may, up to a point, stimulate both growth and
   resistance to infection, for the risk of infection will increase with
   the density of conspecifics.}},

Abstract = {{Substance use patterns and predictors of substance use by women aged 65
   and over were examined using data from the Canadian National Alcohol and
   Other Drugs Survey (1989). Use patterns were consistent with findings
   from previous surveys: that older women drink less alcohol, smoke less
   and use less illicit drugs than other age-gender groups. Also consistent
   with previous surveys, older women reported the highest rate of
   psychoactive prescription drug use of all groups. Bivariate analyses
   indicated significant relationships between some social and demographic
   variables and substance use. Drinking was associated with being single,
   younger, not religious, in better health, and smoking. Smoking was
   associated with being younger, not religious, in poorer health, having
   less social support, drinking, and use of psychoactive prescription
   drugs. Use of psychoactive prescription drugs (especially sleeping
   pills) tended to be associated with being widowed, older, less educated,
   more religious, in poorer health, experiencing higher stress, having
   lower income and less social support, smoking, and use of other
   psychoactive prescription drugs. When data were analysed using principal
   component analysis, two very consistent dimensions of substance use
   emerged for older women: greater religiosity associated with less
   drinking and smoking, and a dimension involving use of all types of
   psychoactive prescription drugs. These findings are discussed in terms
   of projected use patterns for future older women and the need for a
   better understanding of the social context of older women's substance
   use that involves light to moderate alcohol use but a higher rate of use
   of psychoactive prescription drugs than other age-gender groups.}},

Abstract = {{The Mechanic Settlement Pluton, located at the northern margin of the
   Caledonian Highlands in southern New Brunswick, is composed of rocks
   ranging from ultramafic (Iherzolite, plagioclase-bearing Iherzolite)
   through mafic (mainly olivine gabbronorite and gabbro) to intermediate
   (quartz diorite and monzodiorite). Spatial distribution of these
   lithologies, textural features, and geochemistry are consistent with
   evolution of a tholeiitic mafic parent magma by crystal fractionation
   processes, with some evidence for magma mingling between evolved
   gabbroic and quartz dioritic magmas. The dioritic rocks form most of the
   southwestern (upper?) part of the pluton, whereas the varied gabbroic
   rocks with ultramafic layers form the northeastern part. U-Pb (zircon)
   dating of a quartz diorite sample from the southwestern part of the
   pluton indicates crystallization at 557 +/- 3 Ma. Amphibole and
   phlogopite in two Iherzolite samples from the northeastern part of the
   pluton gave Ar-40/Ar-39 dates of 550 +/- 5 and 539 +/- 5 Ma,
   respectively, indicating that the pluton cooled rapidly through the
   closure temperature for amphibole, with subsequent slower cooling to the
   time of phlogopite closure. The pluton is interpreted to be the
   intrusive equivalent of basaltic units in the host Coldbrook Group,
   analogous to granitic plutons elsewhere in the Caledonian Highlands
   which appear to be the intrusive equivalents of felsic volcanic rocks in
   the group. These plutonic and volcanic rocks represent a major,
   short-lived (ca. 560-550 Ma), dominantly bimodal igneous event,
   apparently related to late Precambrian extension within the Avalon
   terrane of southern New Brunswick.}},

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to determine the potential antidepressant, and
   alprazolam after single- and multiple-dose administration in a
   randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study in 48
   healthy male volunteers. A group of 12 subjects received either placebo
   twice daily, 1 mg of alprazolam twice daily, 200 mg of nefazodone twice
   daily, or the combination of 1 mg of alprazolam and 200 mg of nefazodone
   twice daily for 7 days. Serial blood samples were collected after dosing
   on day 1 and day 7 and before the morning dose on days 4, 5, and 6 for
   the determination of alprazolam and its metabolites
   alpha-hydroxyalprazolam (AOH) and 4-hydroxyalprazolam (4OH) and
   nefazodone and its metabolites hydroxynefazodone (HO-nefazodone),
   m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), and a triazole dione metabolite (dione)
   by validated high-performance liquid chromatography methods.
   Steady-state levels in plasma mere reached by day 4 for alprazolam, 4OH,
   nefazodone, HO-nefazodone, mCPP, and dione. Noncompartmental
   pharmacokinetic analysis showed that at steady state, alprazolam C-max
   and AUC(tau) values significantly increased approximately twofold and
   4OH C-max and AUC(tau) values significantly decreased by 40 and 26\%,
   respectively, when nefazodone was coadministered with alprazolam. There
   was no effect of alprazolam on the single-dose or steady-state
   pharmacokinetics of nefazodone, HO-nefazodone, or done after the
   coadministration of alprazolam and nefazodone. However, the mean
   steady-state mCPP C-max and AUC(tau) significantly increased by
   approximately threefold and t(1/2) values significantly increased by
   approximately twofold after the coadministration of alprazolam and
   nefazodone in comparison to those when nefazodone was given alone.
   Competitive inhibition between alprazolam and nefazodone metabolism at
   cytochrome P450 3A4 may be responsible for the pharmacokinetic
   interaction when alprazolam and nefazodone were coadministered. No
   adjustment of nefazodone dosage is required when nefazodone and
   alprazolam are coadministered. Because alprazolam concentrations in
   plasma are increased in the presence of nefazodone, a reduction in
   alprazolam dosage is recommended when the two agents are coadministered.}},

Abstract = {{Flexible esophagogastroscopy (EG) and external beam radiotherapy (EER)
   have become important means of diagnosing and treating both squamous and
   adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastroesophageal (GE) junction.
   Recently, new technology, termed high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDRB),
   utilizing the placement of radioisotopes in the esophagus by endoscopic
   techniques has been introduced. This report describes the endoscopic
   application of the brachytherapy afterloading catheters and the
   additional role of EG in the posttreatment assessment of these patients.
   Twenty-four patients (21 esophageal, 3 GE junction) were treated using
   HDRB delivered by afterloading catheter techniques utilizing flexible
   EG. Radiation dosages ranged from 5 Gy (500 rads) to 8 Gy (800 rads)
   delivered to the tumor bed over an average of three applications. All
   patients were followed to assess swallowing ability, endoscopic evidence
   of tumor reduction, and complications resulting from intraluminal
   radiation therapy. Fifteen patients had reduction in intraluminal tumor
   based on endoscopic evaluation. Seven had partial or complete relief of
   dysphagia. Nine patients required gastrostomy tube placement for
   alimentation before or after therapy. Four patients had complications of
   perforation (1), fistula (1), or bleeding (2) after HDRB. Overall
   survival ranged from 2 to 27 months (mean = 8.9 months) after the first
   HDRB treatment. EG proved to be an efficient and safe technique for the
   introduction of intraluminal esophageal radiation therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine the association of nocturnal eating (getting up
   out of bed to eat) with overweight, binge eating, and negative mood or
   anxiety. Method: Forty overweight women diagnosed with binge eating
   disorder (BED) and 39 overweight controls monitored their nocturnal
   eating for an average of eight nights. Results: Seven instances of
   nocturnal eating were recorded by 6 patients, all of whom were binge
   eaters. Foods consumed nocturnally tended to be selected from those
   favored for binge episodes, and reported control over nocturnal eating
   was low. Patients reported tiredness, but not poor mood or anxiety, at
   the nocturnal eating episodes. Discussion: In this sample, nocturnal
   eating was associated more with eating disorder than overweight. This
   report should provide the basis of future work to determine whether
   nocturnal eating should be evaluated and treated among eating disordered
   or overweight groups of patients. (C) 1995 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The 60 kDa tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR(60)) is regarded as the
   major signal transducer of TNF-induced cellular responses, whereas the
   signal capacity and role of the 80 kDa TNFR (TNFR(80)) remain largely
   undefined, We show here that the transmembrane form of TNF is superior
   to soluble TNF in activating TNFR(80) in various systems such as T cell
   activation, thymocyte proliferation, and granulocyte/macrophage
   colony-stimulating factor production, Intriguingly, activation of
   TNFR(80) by membrane TNF can lead to qualitatively different TNF
   responses such as rendering resistant tumor cells sensitive to
   TNF-mediated cytotoxicity. This study demonstrates that the diversity of
   TNF effects can be controlled through the differential sensitivity of
   TNFR(80) for the two forms of TNF and suggests an important
   physiological role for TNFR(80) in local inflammatory responses.}},

Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{The signal transduction pathways regulated by somatostatin receptor
   subtype 1 (sst1) have been difficult to define because of the
   variability observed when this receptor is expressed in different cell
   types by transfection and because pharmacological approaches are
   inadequate to distinguish sst1 receptor function in tissues or cells
   that express multiple sst receptor subtypes. To study the sst1 receptor
   in its endogenous environment, we developed a polyclonal antibody to a
   15-amino acid peptide corresponding to a unique sequence in the receptor
   carboxyl terminus. The peptide antibody routinely precipitated 70\% of
   the soluble {[}I-125-Tyr(11)]somatostatin/receptor complex prepared from
   Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells expressing the sst1 receptor but
   precipitated <1\% of the complex from cells expressing other sst
   receptor subtypes. Photoaffinity-labeled sst1 receptor was also
   specifically immunoprecipitated and migrated as a broad 60-kDa band on
   sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels. The observation that sst
   receptors from GH(4)C(1) pituitary cells were immunoprecipitated by the
   antibody and that receptors from AR4-2J pancreatic acinar cells were not
   indicated that only the former expressed sst1 receptor protein. Because
   reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed that GH(4)C(1)
   cells contained both sst1 and sst2 receptor mRNA, immunoprecipitation
   permitted the sst1 receptor to be separated from the other receptors
   present. Two observations showed that G proteins were coprecipitated
   with sst1 receptors from GH(4)C(1) cells. First, pertussis toxin
   pretreatment markedly decreased hormone binding in the
   immunoprecipitate. Second, the addition of 20 mu M
   guanosine-5'-(gamma-thio)triphosphate to the immunoprecipitated
   {[}I-125-Tyr(11)]somatostatin/receptor complex stimulated the rate of
   dissociation of bound ligand by 10-fold. Interestingly, however, the
   dissociation rate of similar to 30\% of the ligand/receptor complex was
   unaffected by guanosine-5'-(gamma-thio)triphosphate. In summary, we have
   developed an sst1 receptor-specific antibody and used it to show that
   sstl receptors endogenously expressed in GH(4)C(1) pituitary cells
   couple primarily to pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. Furthermore,
   these receptors exist in two distinct high affinity states distinguished
   by their GTP sensitivity.}},

Abstract = {{Radioimmunoscintigraphy (RIS) using human monoclonal antibodies offers
   the important clinical advantage of repeated imaging over murine
   monoclonal antibodies by eliminating the cross-species antibody
   response. This article reports a Phase I-II clinical trial with
   Tc-99m-labeled, totally human monoclonal antibody 88BV59H21-2 in
   patients with colorectal carcinoma.
   The study population consisted of 34 patients with colorectal cancer (20
   men and 14 women; age range, 44-81 years), Patients were administered
   5-10 mg antibody labeled with 21-41 mCi Tc-99m by the i,v. route and
   imaged at 3-10 and 16-24 h after infusion using planar and single-photon
   emission computed tomographic (CT) techniques, Pathological confirmation
   was obtained in 25 patients who underwent surgery. Human antihuman
   antibody (HAHA) titers were checked prior to and 1 and 3 months after
   the infusion.
   RIS with Tc-99m-labeled 88BV59H21-2 revealed a better detection rate in
   the abdomen-pelvis region compared with axial CT, The combined use of
   both modalities increased the sensitivity in both the liver and
   abdomen-pelvis regions, Ten patients developed mild adverse reactions
   (chills and fever), No HAHA response was detected in this series.
   Tc-99m-labeled human monoclonal antibody 88BV59H21-2 RIS shows promise
   as a useful diagnostic modality in patients with colorectal cancer, RIS
   alone or in combination with CT is more sensitive than CT in detecting
   tumor within the abdomen and pelvis, Repeated RIS studies may be
   possible, due to the lack of a HAHA response.}},

Abstract = {{L-Val-L-boroPro, a potent DP IV (CD26) inhibitor, and its non-inhibitory
   diastereomer L-Val-D-boroPro, were studied by 1D H-1 and B-11 NMR and by
   2D H-1 NMR methods in aqueous solution, Complete 1D H-1 NMR fine
   structures were computer analyzed to obtain the H-1 chemical shifts and
   spin-coupling constants, Dihedral angles were derived from coupling
   constants on the basis of the Altona equation (i.e. an improved Karplus
   equation). The structures and populations of proline ring conformations
   were determined with the aid of pseudo-rotation analysis, Good agreement
   between the distances derived from NOESY data and dihedral
   angle-constrained force-field calculations was obtained, Structural
   analysis allowed the identification of the absolute stereochemistry of
   the a-carbon of the proline residue, and showed that the active
   inhibitor is the diastereomer which is homochiral with L-proline.
   L-Val-L-boroPro exists largely in a single conformer, in contrast to
   L-Val-D-boroPro, which adopts two proline conformations in a 2:1 ratio,
   Analysis of H-1 and B-11 NMR spectra proves that inactivation of the
   inhibitor at physiological pH results from a cyclization reaction in
   which the free N-terminal nitrogen atom forms a covalent bond with the B
   atom.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POLICY MODELING}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{639-657}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this paper a computable general equilibrium model of the Canadian
   economy with a disaggregated agricultural sector was constructed and
   calibrated for 1984 base-year data. The model included agricultural and
   non-agricultural prices, trade, incomes, demands for inputs and outputs.
   The model was solved using the General Algebraic Modeling Systems (GAMS)
   language. The price, quantity and income effects of exchange-rate
   changes on Canadian agricultural sectors were analyzed by shocking the
   exchange rate under different simulations. The results obtained in the
   study indicate that exchange-rate changes have important consequences
   for Canadian agriculture. These effects can be summarized as fluctuation
   of prices, sectoral outputs, factor incomes, and agricultural household
   incomes. The devaluation of the dollar would change the relative prices
   between agricultural and non-agricultural sectors of the economy. There
   would be an improvement in terms of trade in favor of agricultural
   sectors. Hence, return to factors of production in agricultural sectors
   would increase, and agricultural sectors would have a tendency to pull
   mobile factors of production from other sectors. This, in turn, would
   mean an increase in the factor incomes in agricultural sectors. General
   equilibrium results indicated that overall the agricultural sectors
   would gain from a devaluation, but the effects on various sectors of the
   economy would be quite different. It is also found that revaluation of
   the Canadian dollar would harm the agricultural households through
   decreased prices, outputs, and incomes. These results indicate that
   exchange-rate and macroeconomic policy changes may be one of the causes
   of agricultural price and income instability in Canada.}},

Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{1-2}},

Abstract = {{The effect of interrupting aeration on itaconic acid fermentation by A.
   terreus NRRL 1960 has been studied. Under the conditions used, stopping
   aeration for 5 min led to a complete cessation of itaconic acid
   production, which was only slowly restored after 24 h when aeration was
   resumed. After a 5-min break in aeration and in the presence of 0.1 mM
   cycloheximide no itaconic acid was formed even after 3 days. It seems
   that, upon oxygen shortage, a rapid destruction of the
   itaconic-acid-producing mechanism takes place, which is restored only
   aerobically in a slow process involving protein synthesis. Itaconic acid
   fermentation is also effectively stopped by metabolic inhibitors of ATP
   formation, pointing to the need for biochemical energy in maintaining
   the fermentation. ATP is possibly needed to maintain a proper
   physiological (i.e. near neutral) pH inside the cells, counteracting the
   acid produced in the fermentation process and the low external pH (below
   2.0). Inhibitors of plasma membrane ATPase have no effect on itaconic
   acid fermentation. This indicates that the plasma membrane might be
   impermeable to H+ and that ATP might rather be involved in the transport
   of itaconic acid out of the cell. It is suggested that insufficient
   aeration may lead to insufficient production of ATP which, in turn,
   leads to damage of the metabolic machinery by acid produced in the
   fermentation process.}},

Abstract = {{To determine the effect of routine repeat testing in serum screening for
   Down's syndrome, we compared estimates of the detection and
   false-positive rates. Five serum markers were measured-alpha-fetoprotein
   (AFP), unconjugated oestriol (uE(3)), human chorionic gonadotrophin
   (hCG), and its mio subunits, free alpha and free beta-hCG. First and
   repeat test marker levels were available from 142 women whose samples
   had been routinely collected and stored in an antenatal serum bank.
   Different repeat testing policies were compared for various combinations
   of the markers. If all women had repeat tests using the four markers
   AFP, uE(3), and free alpha and free beta-hCG, the detection rate for a 5
   per cent false-positive rate was 69 per cent compared with 65 per cent
   if no women were repeated. Policies of repeating selected women gave
   similar results. The small gain in screening performance with repeat
   testing performed routinely is not worthwhile. If a woman does happen to
   have a repeat test, her risk estimate should, however, be based on both
   results, not just the second.}},

   by 5-HT (10 mg/kg, s.c.), 2-methyl-5-HT (30 mg/kg, s.c.), neostigmine
   (0.03-0.1 mg/kg, s.c.), corticotropin releasing factor (CRF; 1 mu g

   in a dose-dependent manner. Ondansetron (10 mg/kg, p.o.) and granisetron
   (1 mg/kg, p.o.) also inhibited the stress-accelerated colonic transit,
   but azasetron was more effective than these two drugs. Atropine
   methylbromide (0.1 mg/kg, s.c) and tetrodotoxin (0.01 mg/kg, sc.)
   inhibited the accelerated colonic transit under stress conditions, but
   methysergide (10 mg/kg, s.c.), SDZ205-557 (10 mg/kg, s.c.), domperidone
   (30 mg/kg, p.o.), trimebutine (300 mg/kg, p.o.), and metoclopramide (30
   mg/kg, p.o.) did not. Azasetron (10 mu g) administered
   intracerebroventricularly did not inhibit the stress-induced
   acceleration. These results suggest that endogenous 5-HT which is
   released through stress accelerates the colonic transit via the 5-HT3
   receptors and finally a cholinergic mechanism. It is considered that
   azasetron inhibits colonic transit particularly under stress conditions
   through the blockade of the peripheral 5-HT3 receptors. Azasetron may
   improve bowel function in stress-related colonic dysfunction like
   irritable bowel syndrome.}},

   ability to inhabit mesic or very cold environments by such species is
   achieved through different morphological, physiological or behavioural

   certain kinds of inquiry to increase our understanding of how mentoring
   enhances the individual's and organization's capacity to change and

Abstract = {{Measurements of the kinetics of activity loss by rabbit muscle lactate
   dehydrogenase in acetate-chloride buffer, pH 5.0, I 0.20, have shown
   that the enzyme exhibits greater stability against irreversible
   inactivation when the buffer is supplemented with sucrose (0.1 M-0.5 M).
   On the basis of sedimentation equilibrium distributions obtained for
   enzyme in the absence and presence of sucrose (0.5 M), the lactate
   dehydrogenase is essentially dimeric in both environments. The observed
   stabilization of enzyme activity has therefore been considered in terms
   of the space-filling effects of sucrose on an isomerization equilibrium
   between native and unfolded forms of dimeric lactate dehydrogenase,
   which precedes irreversible inactivation of the unfolded isomer.
   Interpretation of the kinetic results on that basis has led to the
   conclusion that the initial stage of enzyme unfolding entails a minor
   change in volume and/or asymmetry of the lactate dehydrogenase that
   gives rise to a 4\% increase in the second virial coefficient describing
   excluded volume interactions between dimeric enzyme and sucrose.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to investigate whether learning benefits
   in multiple-task learning situations are a result of contextual
   interference or of schema enhancement related to the amount of
   variability in the practice session. Two experiments were designed that
   replicated and extended the experiment reported by Wulf and Schmidt
   (1988). In a 2 (same vs. different relative time) x 2 (blocked vs.
   random practice schedule) design, 48 right-handed subjects were randomly
   assigned to one of four experimental conditions. A tapping task was
   employed that required a right-handed tap of three small brass plates
   arranged in a diamond pattern. Each segment had a specific time
   requirement. Target times and response times were provided on a computer
   screen directly in front of the subject. Each subject participated in
   two acquisition sessions (i.e., 198 practice trials) and was tested for
   learning on several different retention and transfer tests. In
   Experiment 2, a control group was added that received no acquisition
   phase. Results of both experiments showed a typical centextual
   interference effect, with depressed scores by the random groups during
   acquisition but significantly better scores than the blocked groups on
   several retention and transfer tests. Certain characteristics of the
   tests were found to influence the demonstration of the practice schedule
   effects. These results were consistent with predictions from Magill and
   Hall (1990) that the learning benefits of contextual interference are
   more likely to occur when skill variations are from different classes of
   movement and that the amount of variability in practice is more
   influential when the to-be-learned tasks are parameter modifications of
   the same generalized motor program.}},

Abstract = {{We mapped the hardness of the rock surrounding shaped-charge
   perforations with an indentation technique based on the Brinell method.
   We fired conventional perforators (3.2-g explosive weight) into a
   friable sandstone (approximately 6.9 MPa unconfined compressive
   strength) under 10.3 MPa effective stress. We observed substantial
   reductions in hardness extending more than 10 cm away from the
   perforation tunnel. The severity and extent of the damage was not
   uniform and was greatest near the perforation at the entrance hole,
   decreasing toward its tip. A comparison with a similar test with a
   drilled hole demonstrated that the observed damage was caused by the
   impact of the shaped-charge jet on the reek. The extent of the damage
   was independent of the diameter of the rock specimen used during the
   test. By assuming that permeability reduction is proportional to
   mechanical damage (i.e., hardness reduction), we obtained numerical
   simulations of flow rate and distribution. The calculated flow rates
   were consistent with those measured after perforating the samples.
   Careful analysis of the data suggested that the mechanical damage and
   permeability reduction were related to increases in finer particle sizes
   and smaller pore sizes that were observed by other workers. These led to
   increased tortuosity in the flow paths.
   The classic vision of a thin, uniform crushed zone with reduced
   permeability surrounding the perforation tunnel did not seem to apply in
   the case of more friable materials. The calculated permeability map
   suggested that much of the flow occurred at the perforation tip for such
   rocks, indicating that downhole conditions were probably better
   simulated by linear-flow-rather than radial-flow-model targets. Finally,
   the radial extent of the damaged zone around the perforation tunnel
   raised questions concerning the interaction between adjacent
   perforations in a vertical plane when large shot densities were used.}},

Abstract = {{The fiber distributed data interface (FDDI) is suitable for real-time
   communication because of the high speed and the performance guarantees
   it provides. However, these guarantees are achieved at the expense of
   non-real-time traffic because the real time messages are given higher
   priority over non-realtime messages, resulting in excessive delays for
   non-real-time messages. In this paper, we propose a scheme for reducing
   the response time of non real-time messages while still providing the
   same guarantees to real-time messages. In particular, the proposed
   approach gives higher priority to real-time messages only when it is
   absolutely necessary in order for them to meet their deadlines.
   Non-real-time messages are thus transmitted ahead of real-time messages
   whenever possible, We present an algorithm for determining when and by
   how much the transmission of a real-time message can be deferred without
   jeopardizing its deadline, The proposed approach is evaluated through
   simulation. The simulation results show that a substantial reduction in
   the mean response time of non-real-time messages is achieved when using
   the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{The -3/2 power rule, or -3/2 self-thinning rule, was accepted 10 years
   ago as an important generalization, but has recently been questioned by
   a number of authors. This paper assesses what remains of the rule. While
   it has been empirically established that size-density trajectories
   followed by self-thinning plant populations do not necessarily follow a
   -3/2 slope, a more general power rule describing a density-dependent
   upper limit to mean shoot biomass per plant (the ` -3/2 boundary rule')
   remains largely intact.
   Principal component analysis (PCA) overestimates the steepness of the
   thinning slope if y:x variance ratio is greater than 1:1. Lonsdale's
   (Ecology 71: 1373-1388) overall mean PCA slope of - 0.6 for
   biomass-density suggests a true mean slope close to the theoretical
   value of -0.5. Reduced major axis (RMA) regression appears a reasonable
   approximation for the -3/2 but not the -1/2 formulation of the rule.
   Fitting of a linear functional relationship (LFR) is a more appropriate
   slope estimation procedure, not previously used for data on thinning.
   None of these procedures estimates a boundary line that is not
   transgressed by any data point except through errors of measurement.
   Mortality due to overcrowding ensues when a small, suppressed plant no
   longer holds its leaves high enough in the canopy to maintain a positive
   carbon balance. It follows that LAI should remain constant during
   thinning, and that self-thinning theory should be developed in terms of
   maximum leaf area index and the biomass required to support it. A
   derivation is presented and some of its consequences are examined. (C)

Abstract = {{A preliminary report questioning the efficacy of zidovudine (AZT) in the

   questions the expedited process by which AZT was approved, While the
   public historically has influenced drug policy, recent changes were
   brought about by activists threatening civil insurrection to expand
   access to unapproved treatments. Turner's social conflict theory is used
   to explain the recent structural changes in the drug approval process in
   terms of the overt struggle for control over access to potentially
   life-saving drugs, This passion for change is shown to be a result of
   the stigma of the disease itself. Challenging the hegemony of the FDA
   was a mechanism by which activists coped with the imputed stigma of
   AIDS, While controversial, activism has increased access to new drugs
   and will have a far-reaching impact on how future drugs are approved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The time course and reversibility of sodium nitroprusside's
   in vivo inhibition of platelet function are unclear.
   Methods: Platelet aggregation and P-selectin expression as measures of
   platelet dense and alpha-granule release, respectively, were examined
   before and after administration of sodium nitroprusside (18 mg) to human
   volunteers and in in vitro studies. Hypotension occurring with sodium
   nitroprusside administration was treated with intravenous crystalloid
   and/or phenylephrine.
   Results: Compared with preinfusion studies, platelet aggregation to
   epinephrine was significantly inhibited immediately and 4 min after
   discontinuation of the sodium nitroprusside infusion but returned to
   baseline at 8 and 12 min after discontinuing sodium nitroprusside.
   However, both dense and alpha-granule release to adenosine diphosphate
   after in vivo sodium nitroprusside were never significantly inhibited
   even at the time when sodium nitroprusside infusion was maximal. In
   contrast to our in vivo findings, in vitro incubation of platelet-rich
   plasma with sodium nitroprusside resulted in significant inhibition of
   dense and alpha-granule release to adenosine diphosphate. These in vitro
   inhibitory effects of sodium nitroprusside were reversed by pretreatment
   with epinephrine but not phenylephrine.
   Conclusions: In normal volunteers, sodium nitroprusside inhibits
   platelet aggregation to epinephrine but not adenosine diphosphate;
   inhibition was reversed within 8-12 min after discontinuing sodium
   nitroprusside, Sodium nitroprusside in vitro inhibition of platelet
   function to adenosine diphosphate was reversed by epinephrine
   pretreatment. Because of the rapid reversibility of its antiplatelet
   effect, sodium nitroprusside may be clinically useful even when there is
   the potential for impaired coagulation.}},

Abstract = {{After an injury to the vascular endothelium, certain blood proteins
   collect rapidly at the site of damage to prevent blood loss and maintain
   blood flow. The uptake of fibrinogen, plasminogen, and antithrombin-but
   not prothrombin-have been measured previously at the rabbit aorta wall
   after injury in vivo. This report describes the clearance of rabbit
   iodine (131)-labeled prothrombin from the rabbit circulation to measure
   the distribution and fractional catabolic rate and compares the behavior
   of I-131-labeled prothrombin with either iodine 125-labeled fibrinogen
   I-125-labeled antithrombin at the balloon catheter-injured aorta wall.
   When injected into young rabbits, I-131-labeled prothrombin was cleared
   from the intravascular space to yield a plasma curve that was best
   described by three exponentials, Fractional plasma and whole body
   catabolic rates were 2.0 day(-1) and 0.41 day(-1), respectively,
   equivalent to a catabolic half-life of 1.7 days. Fractional distribution
   of prothrombin amounted to 0.21, 0.24, and 0.55 within the
   intravascular, vascular endothelial, and extravascular compartments,
   respectively. Samples of I-131-labeled prothrombin and either
   I-125-labeled fibrinogen or I-125-labeled antithrombin were injected
   into anaesthetized rabbits before balloon de-endothelialization of the
   thoracic aorta. The uptake of each radiolabeled protein by the aorta
   intima-media was measured at various times (5 to 60 minutes) after
   injury. Whereas uptake of plasma fibrinogen by the balloon-injured
   intima-media was maximal (20 pmol/cm(2)) in less than 5 minutes after
   injury, maximum uptake of prothrombin (5 to 6 pmol/cm(2)) took
   approximately 15 minutes. Uptake of prothrombin was initially faster
   than that of antithrombin, although approximately equimolar amounts of
   prothrombin and antithrombin were bound by the intimamedia by 60
   minutes. The results are discussed in relation to thrombin production
   and the demand for antithrombin by the damaged aorta wall in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To compare the type and incidence of morbidity encountered by
   two groups of patients with maxillary fractures, one treated by closed
   reduction and maxillomandibular fixation and the other by open reduction
   and rigid internal fixation.
   Study design. This was a retrospective review of records for all
   patients with maxillary fractures treated over a 10-year period. Age,
   sex, mechanism of injury, anatomic location of fracture, treatment
   modality, and complications were identified. Two populations of
   patients, those treated with closed reduction and maxillomandibular
   fixation and those treated with open reduction and rigid internal
   fixation, that were similar in size (n = 50), age, sex, and anatomic
   distribution of fractures were compared.
   Results and conclusions. This study indicates that patients with
   maxillary fractures treated with either closed reduction and
   maxillomandibular fixation or open reduction and rigid internal fixation
   will encounter postoperative problems with a near equal frequency (60\%
   to 64\%). Regardless of the technique used, no relationship could be
   established between age, sex, or cause of injury. The more superior the
   level of the fracture, the higher the rate of adverse sequelae.}},

Abstract = {{We describe our implementation of an extremely detailed model atom of
   singly ionized iron for NLTE computations in static and moving
   astrophysical plasmas. Our model atom includes 617 levels, 13,675
   primary permitted transitions and up to 1.2 million secondary
   transitions. Our approach guarantees that the total iron opacity is

   that special wavelength points inserted along the detailed profile

Abstract = {{Third-stage (dauer) juveniles of the entomopathogenic nematode
   Steinernema feltiae from 3 laboratory populations were tested for
   infectivity to larvae of the sciarid fly Lycoriellia solani. Bioassay
   experiments were done to assess the effects of nematode application
   density, exposure time and host density on the proportion of individuals
   that established infection. When dauer stages were presented to a host
   singly, establishment rates of 28, 26 and 18\% were obtained for the 3
   populations, but the presence of conspecifics consistently increased the
   rate of establishment to 42, 33 and 21\%, respectively, at 20 nematodes
   per host. A modified binomial model was del eloped to show that nematode
   establishment was not related to application density in a linear
   fashion, as initial infection facilitated secondary colonization. The
   data suggest that 3 subpopulations of nematodes may be distinguished by
   their infection behaviour: a first group of individuals with the
   behavioural propensity to initiate infection in unparasitized insects, a
   second that only invaded infected hosts, and a third group of
   non-invaders that failed to establish in L. solani.}},

Abstract = {{We present the results of a study of interstellar extinction in the
   visible to near-infrared, based on a photometric study of 154 highly
   obscured OB stars in the southern Milky Way. Absolute visual extinctions
   (A(V)) of individual stars are deduced by three distinct methods, with
   extrapolation to zero frequency based on (1) the van de Hulst
   theoretical curve 15, (2) the empirical formula of Cardelli, Clayton, \&
   Mathis, and (3) the power law of Martin \& Whittet. Results agree to
   within 3\%, and we conclude that the relation A(V) = 1.1 E(V-K), based
   on the van de Hulst curve, provides a reliable and straightforward way
   to estimate A(V) for individual stars. Results lie in the range 2 mag <
   A(V) < 6 mag for stars in our sample. Our catalog of highly reddened
   stars provides a potentially valuable source list for future studies of
   interstellar phenomena within 10 kpc of the Sun, such as gas-phase
   atomic and molecular abundances, cloud kinematics, polarization, and the
   morphology of the Galactic magnetic field, as well as interstellar
   extinction.
   In this paper we use the data to refine various parameters which
   characterize the extinction law. We derive a mean extinction curve,
   yielding a ratio of total to selective extinction R(V) = A(V)/E(B-V) =
   3.08 +/- 0.05. Values for individual stars lie in the range 2.5-4.7.
   Stars with R(V) substantially greater than the mean value tend to lie
   relatively close to the Sun, suggesting that their extinctions may be
   dominated by dust in local dark clouds. The mean value of R(V) for stars
   beyond 2 kpc is 2.97 +/- 0.03. We confirm previous results which suggest
   that extinction curves converge to a single functional form in the
   infrared (lambda > 0.90 mu m), well described by a power law of index
   1.73 +/- 0.04 and further characterized by a color excess ratio
   E(J-H)/E(H-K) similar or equal to 1.64. We also show that visual
   extinctions may, in principle, be estimated purely from measurements in
   the infrared using the relation A(V) = rE(J-K), where r similar to
   1.87/(0.65 - R(V)(-1)). This result may be applied to the problem of
   determining A(V) for highly obscured objects lacking optical
   counterparts in regions where R(V) is known.}},

Abstract = {{The obese gene product, leptin, regulates adiposity. Mice homozygous for
   a nonfunctional obese gene become massively obese and develop diabetes
   mellitus due to overeating and increased metabolic efficiency. The cDNA
   sequence of obese was recently reported (Zhang, Y., Proenca, R., Maffei,
   M., Barone, M., Leopold, L., and Friedman, J. L. (1994) Nature 372,
   425-432; Correction: (1995 Nature 374, 479). We have determined the
   genomic organization of the 5' end of the mouse obese gene. The coding
   sequence is in exons 2 and 3, A single TATA-containing promoter was
   found upstream of exon 1. A minority (probably similar to 5\%) of the
   obese mRNA contained an extra, untranslated exon between exons 1 and 2.
   Transcription of the obese gene was detected only in adipose cells. A
   762 base pair obese gene promoter driving a luciferase gene yielded
   abundant activity in transiently transfected rat adipose cells in
   primary culture. The obese promoter was inactive in erythroid K562
   cells. Deletion of bases from -762 downstream to -161 did not affect
   promoter activity in transfected adipose cells. The -161 minimal
   promoter contained consensus Spl and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein
   (C/EBP) motifs. Cotransfection with C/EBP alpha (a transcription factor
   important in adipose cell differentiation) caused 23-fold activation.
   These data suggest that the obese promoter is a natural target of C/EBP
   alpha.}},

Abstract = {{Specimens of penile erectile tissue from the corpus cavernosum (CC) and
   corpus spongiosum (CS) of beagle dogs were investigated with reference
   to morphological and functional aspects of the nitric oxide (NO) system.
   Using immunohistochemistry, the smooth muscle bundles of the CC were
   found to contain a rich innervation, as seen by the pan-neuronal marker,
   protein gene product 9.5. A large number of nerves also stained
   positively for acetylcholine esterase. There was a moderate to rich
   supply of nerves containing NO synthase, which was frequently
   co-localized with vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. CS preparations
   from the proximal penis (the spongious bulb) had an innervation similar
   to that of the CC. However, CS preparations from the distal penis had a
   distinctly lower density of nerves than the proximal part, and spongious
   tissue from the glans penis was practically devoid of nerves. In
   isolated preparations of proximal and distal CC and CS, contracted by
   noradrenaline, electrical field stimulation (EFS) produced
   frequency-dependent relaxations. The responses were less pronounced in
   preparations from the distal penis, particularly in the CS.
   Pre-treatment with the NO-synthesis inhibitor N-G-nitro-L-arginine
   abolished all relaxations. Carbachol effectively relaxed
   noradrenaline-contracted strips. The responses were similar in proximal
   preparations from the CC and CS, and significantly less pronounced in
   strips from the distal penis. N-G-nitro-L-arginine significantly reduced
   the relaxant effect of carbachol. Preparations of spongious tissue from
   the glans penis did not react to high potassium solution, addition of
   noradrenaline, or EFS. The results demonstrate regional differences
   within the CS, both in innervation and functional responses.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a spectral element-fourier algorithm for
   simulating incompressible turbulent flows in complex geometries using
   unstructured quadrilateral meshes. To this end, we compare two different
   interface formulations for extending the conforming spectral element
   method in order to allow for surgical mesh refinement and still retain
   spectral accuracy: the Zanolli iterative procedure and variational
   patching based on auxiliary `'mortar'' functions. We present an
   interpretation of the original mortar element method as a patching
   scheme and develop direct and iterative solution techniques that make
   the method efficient for simulations of turbulent flows. The properties
   of the new method are analyzed in detail by studying the eigenspectra of
   the advection and diffusion operators. We then present numerical results
   that illustrate the flexibility as well as the exponential Convergence
   of the new algorithm for nonconforming discretizations. We conclude with
   simulation studies of the turbulent cylinder wake at Re = 1000 (external
   flow) and turbulent flow over riblets at Re = 3280 (internal flow). (C)

Abstract = {{CD8(+) cytotoxic T cell (CTL) clones with specificity for defined minor
   and major histocompatibility (H) antigens were used to monitor antigen
   presentation in human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-infected skin fibroblasts.
   At the immediate early stage of virus replication antigen presentation
   was intact, but was abolished during the early and late phase. Lack of
   CTL recognition was not selective for certain antigens but was
   associated with decreased steady state levels of nascent MHC class I
   complexes and unassembled MHC class I heavy chains, whereas free
   beta(2)-microglobulin remained abundant. HCMV also affected the
   stability of both immature endoglycosidase H (Endo H)-sensitive and
   mature Endo H-resistant MHC class I molecules, suggesting that the virus
   interferes with antigen presentation at more than one step during
   maturation of the MHC class I complex. The action of interferon-gamma
   (IFN-gamma) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) lifted the
   block of MHC class I complex formation by stimulating synthesis,
   assembly and stability of MHC class I molecules. This resulted in
   restored antigen presentation provided that cells were exposed to the
   factors before HCMV infection. Because few MHC molecules suffice for CTL
   recognition these cytokines compensated for the negative viral effect on
   the antigen presentation function. Nevertheless, the viral interference
   with MHC class I complex formation was still active. The data imply that
   specific cytokines limit the immune evasion potential of HCMV from
   CD8(+) T lymphocyte control.}},

Abstract = {{Infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV), a birnavirus, is an
   important pathogen in fish farms. Analyses of viral proteins showed that
   VP2 is the major structural and immunogenic polypeptide of the virus.
   All neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against IPNV are specific
   to VP2 and bind to continuous or discontinuous epitopes. In order to
   determine which parts of the protein are involved in antigenic
   variations, five IPNV strains were sequenced over the VP2 coding region.
   Comparison of the sequences obtained with three previously published
   strains revealed a central variable domain (positions 183 to 335) which
   encompasses two hydrophilic hypervariable segments. Viral mutants which
   escaped neutralization were then selected with anti-VP2 mAbs directed
   against discontinuous epitopes. Sequencing of three mutants revealed a
   single amino acid mismatch in each of them. All of these substitutions
   occurred in the hypervariable segments, suggesting that these regions
   are involved in the formation of a discontinuous epitope. Finally,
   expression of different truncated VP2s in Escherichia coli allowed
   localization of the binding site for neutralizing mAbs which recognize
   continuous epitopes. One of these mAbs bound to the region adjacent to
   the C-terminus of the variable domain of VP2, while two others reacted
   with the central and C-terminal parts of the variable domain. No
   antibody reacted with the N-terminus of VP2. These results suggest that
   the variable domain of VP2 and the 20 adjacent amino acids of the
   conserved C-terminal part are the most important in inducing an immune
   response for the protection of animals. (C) 1995 Academic Press, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The cellular distribution of 65 and 70 kD heat shock proteins (HSPs) was
   studied in the normal rat kidney and after acute tubular necrosis (ATN)
   induced by inorganic mercury (HgCl2). In the normal kidney the 65 kD HSP
   was found in the cytoplasm of podocytes and proximal convoluted tubules,
   whereas the 70 kD HSP was located in nuclei and cytoplasm of podocytes,
   cortical convoluted, and collecting tubules. The distribution of both
   HSPs along ATN changed as a function of time. In the early phase, before
   evidence of histological damage, both HSPs were found in the
   pielocalyceal epithelium and medullary collecting tubules. During the
   necrotic phase, HSPs coexisted with sites of severe damage (i.e.
   cortical tubules). With immunoelectron microscopy, damaged cells showed
   an abundance of 65 kD HSP-I in mitochondria, as well as in chromatin and
   nucleoli, while 70 kD HSP-I was overexpressed in the cytoplasm,
   mitochondria, lysosomes, cytoskeleton, chromatin, and nucleoli, and
   coincided with urinary excretion of HSPs. In the postregenerative phase,
   the distribution of HSPs was similar to that found in the normal kidney.
   HSPs of 65 and 70 kD were encountered constitutionally and their
   immunolabeling is correlated with the magnitude of cell injury.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the association
   between several dimensions of perfectionism and measures of eating
   disorder symptoms, body image, and appearance self-esteem in college
   students. Method: A sample of 81 female university students completed
   the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale, the Perfectionistic
   Self-Presentation Scale, the Eating Attitudes Test, the Bulimia Test,
   the Body Image Avoidance Questionnaire, and two measures of self-esteem.
   Results: It was found that whereas self-oriented perfectionism was
   related only to anorexic symptoms, the social facets of perfectionism,
   especially socially prescribed perfectionism and the perfectionistic
   self-presentation dimensions, were related to eating disorder symptoms
   as well as body image avoidance and self-esteem. Discussion: The
   findings support the usefulness of differentiating personal and
   interpersonal dimensions of perfectionism as well as trait versus
   self-presentational aspects of perfectionism in investigating
   personality and attitudes and behaviors related to eating disorders. (C)

Abstract = {{This pulse-exposure model (PULSETOX) is based on the simple
   one-compartment first-order kinetics (1CFOK) equation. It tracks the
   accumulation of waterborne organic chemicals by fish and predicts acute
   toxicity by means of previously established relationships between
   whole-body residues and lethality. The predictive capabilities of the
   model were tested with a data set of 27 acute pulse-exposure lethality
   tests with larval fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) exposed to
   pentachlorophenol (PCP). Tests included eight single exposures (2 to 96
   h) and 19 multiple exposures, which varied in the number (2 to 15) and
   duration (2 to 24 h) of pulses, and time interval between pulses (6 to
   24 h). Experimental work included determination of 1CFOK kinetics
   parameters from {[}C-14]PCP uptake and clearance, and from time-toxicity
   curves. Lethality was expected in any exposure regime where the fish
   reaches or exceeds the critical body residue (CBR) of 0.30 mmol PCP/kg
   fish (so, +/-0.02; n = 11). Using the CBR endpoint, the model accounted
   for between 90 and 93\% of variability in the observed lethality data,
   depending on the toxicokinetic parameters employed. Predictive power of
   the model was optimized by using kinetics parameters derived from the
   toxicity curve for pulse-toxicity tests as shown by the regression:
   predicted LC50 = 1.04 (observed LC50) + 0.01 (p < 0.001, r(2) = 0.94, n
   = 27).}},

   degrees C. On the other hand temperature and humidity changes
   respectively caused wavelength shifts of 0.9 and 5 nm in the

Abstract = {{These studies were designed to determine the role of arachidonic acid
   metabolites in catecholamine secretion from adrenal chromaffin cells.
   Inhibitors of the cytochrome P450-dependent metabolism of arachidonic
   acid were shown to interfere with stimulus-secretion coupling in
   cultured chromaffin cells. Ketoconazole (10 mu M), clotrimazole (20 mu
   M) and piperonyl butoxide (50 mu M) inhibited carbachol-dependent
   catecholamine secretion by 44\%, 83\%, and 100\%, respectively;
   histamine-dependent secretion by 25\%, 60\%, and 81\%, and secretion
   induced by 59 mM KCl depolarization by 25\%, 55\%, and 89\%. Uptake of
   Ca-45(2+) into the cells in response to carbachol was inhibited 63\% by
   ketoconazole, 86\% by clotrimazole, and 95\% by piperonyl butoxide;
   KCl-dependent uptake was inhibited 7\%, 56\%, and 85\%, respectively.
   However, cytochrome P450 inhibitors did not inhibit catecholamine
   secretion when cells were stimulated with the calcium ionophores
   ionomycin or lasalocid. These results indicated the involvement of a
   cytochrome P450 product in controlling Ca2+ influx in response to
   membrane depolarization. Cells prelabeled with {[}H-3]arachidonic acid
   formed a H-3-labeled metabolite which comigrated with authentic
   5,6-epoxyeicosatrienoic (5,6-EET) acid on reverse phase and normal phase
   HPLC. Pretreatment with clotrimazole inhibited the production of this
   H-3-labeled metabolite. Addition of synthetic 5,6-EET (1 nM) to cells
   pretreated with piperonyl butoxide resulted in catecholamine secretion.
   These data suggest a role for a cytochrome P450 metabolite of
   arachidonic acid in agonist-stimulated catecholamine secretion.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this retrospective analysis was to search for possible
   associations between snoring and arousals. We searched our data base
   containing more than 2,000 records and selected only patients who 1) had
   objective measurements of snoring, 2) were not raking sedating
   medication, 3) did not have sleep apnea (apnea/ hypopnea index (10) and
   3) did not have periodic leg movements (myoclonus index <5). This
   procedure loft 367 patients available for analysis. We hypothesized that
   arousals observed in these patients were associated with snoring, and we
   performed univariate and multivariate regression analysis with arousals
   as the dependent variable, and age, body mass index, snoring, maximum
   nocturnal sound intensity and nocturnal oxygen saturation as the
   independent variables. The results showed that only snoring and mean
   nocturnal oxygen saturation were significant (p < 0.05) but weak
   determinants of arousals, accounting for only 7\% of their variance. To
   examine whether snorers have more arousals than non-snorers, we compared
   a control group of non-snorers (<50 snores/hour of sleep), with a group
   of heavy snorers (>400 snores/hour of sleep). We found that the arousal
   index was significantly but weakly higher in snorers than non-snorers
   {[}mean +/- standard deviation (SD) = 14 +/- 8 vs. 10 +/- 6, p < 0.002].
   Conversely, patients within the highest arousal quartile snored
   significantly more than those within the lowest quartile (snoring index
   293 +/- 292 vs. 179 +/- 282, p < 0.008, respectively). We conclude that
   despite the limitations of this retrospective analysis, there appears to
   be an association between snoring and arousals, warranting further,
   properly designed prospective studies.}},

Abstract = {{In this study we examine male song output as a measure of nest site
   quality in blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla). Song rate, breeding success,
   predation on nests and reaction to playbacks were investigated in
   individual males. Habitat features determining nest site and song post
   quality in terms of vegetation cover were compared between successful
   nests and nests that had suffered predation. We thee related song rate
   of unmated males to habitat factors in territories and nesting sites in
   order to examine a possible predictor function of blackcap song for
   habitat quality. Several habitat features are responsible for variation
   in nesting success. These features also correlate with song rate of
   unmated males. The study indicates a potential role of song rate in the
   advertisement of territory quality. Furthermore, the data suggest that
   females use song rates rather than territory quality in mating
   decisions. The information females may gain about male quality in
   relation to territory quality are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{An inventory was conducted of small (less than or equal to 2 ha)
   freshwater wetlands composed of some combination of open water and
   emergent marsh in the metropolitan area of Portland, Oregon to (1)
   document changes in the wetland resource since the National Wetlands
   Inventory (NWI) was conducted (1981/1982 aerial photograph dates) and
   (2) identify patterns in wetland loss and degradation over a 10-year
   period in a rapidly urbanizing area. Wetlands identified on NWI maps
   were visited during summer 1992, and data on the location, wetland type,
   and surrounding land use or the cause of loss were collected. Of the 233
   wetlands identified by NWI in 1981/1982, approximately 40\% had been
   destroyed by human activities or were missing due to drought. Although
   conversion to urban land uses was the predominant cause of wetland loss
   from human activities, agricultural conversion accounted for about 31\%.
   Drier-end wetlands (e.g., seasonally flooded) were missing from the
   landscape most frequently. Of the 141 wetlands still existing, 25\% were
   severely degraded by human activities. Approximately half of those
   wetlands not severely degraded were affected by noise, and about 40\%
   were disturbed, primarily by grazing and littering. We suggest that
   because land uses change quickly in rapidly urbanizing areas, leading to
   increased pressures to convert wetlands, resource agencies and urban
   planners should conduct similar inventories in other metropolitan areas.
   Then, demographic projections could be used in conjunction with
   information on patterns in wetland loss to identify and prioritize areas
   for wetland protection before development takes place.}},

Abstract = {{The nonhuman primate, Macaca fascicularis, was used to study the role of
   immunization with selected members of the periodontopathic microbiota in
   the longitudinal progression of ligature-induced periodontitis. Animals
   were immunized with cell envelope antigens prepared from Porphyromonas
   gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia, and a mixture prepared from
   Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, and Actinomyces viscosus.
   Serum immunoglobulin G-(IgG), IgM and IgA isotype antibodies increased
   significantly in all immunization groups and were specific for each of
   the immunogens. P. gingivalis and P. intermedia immunization resulted in
   a stabilization of the proportions of these species throughout most of
   the experiment. The high P. gingivalis antibody titer resulted in low P.
   gingivalis numbers being recovered. P. gingivalis immunization, while
   lowering recoverable viable P. gingivalis, resulted in significantly
   increased levels of Prevotella la loescheii, Prevotella buccae,
   Bacteroides macacae and Prevotella melaninogenica compared with
   preligation and preimmunization levels. Actinobacillus
   actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga spp. and Eikenella spp. remained
   at preligation levels postimmunization. Campylobacter spp. increased
   significantly during the course of the experiment in all groups, whereas
   the levels of Fusobacterium spp. decreased. Plaque indices and bleeding
   on probing showed significant increases in all groups following
   ligation, with the placebo group showing the greatest increase. Pocket
   depth measurements revealed that, whereas the placebo animals showed an
   approximate 5\% increase, the P. gingivalis- and P. intermedia-immunized
   groups showed nearly a 20\% increase in pocket depth. Attachment level
   measurements showed significantly greater attachment loss in the P.
   gingivalis- and P. intermedia-immunized groups, and the F. nucleatum + C
   rectus + A. viscosus immunization appeared to prevent significant
   changes in pocket depth/ attachment level loss. Radiographic measurement
   of bone loss by computer-assisted densitometric image analysis revealed
   that the placebo group lost bone throughout the experiment. P.
   gingivalis- and P. intermedia-immunized groups showed an exacerbated
   loss of bone density and the group immunized with F. nucleatum + C.
   rectus + A. viscosus exhibited significantly lower amounts of bone loss
   when analyzed by computer-assisted densitometric image analysis,
   compared with the other immunized groups. Although immunization with P.
   gingivalis and P. intermedia cell envelope antigens had an effect on
   their emergence in the complex microbiota of the developing periodontal
   pocket, this immunization also resulted in greater bone loss than
   immunization with F. nucleatum + C. rectus + A. viscosus, suggesting
   that, whereas selected members of the putative periodontopathic
   microbiota may play a direct role in periodontal tissue destruction, the
   complexity of the subgingival microbiota dictates that considerable
   scrutiny is required to select useful immunogens that can elicit
   functional protection from periodontal tissue destruction induced by
   oral microorganisms that already colonize or infect the host.}},

   functions (MTFs) of a binocular objective system made in Korea. The MTFs
   were measured for fields of view (FOV) of 0 degrees and 1.5 degrees. The
   phase modulation was carried out by giving a phase retardation pi to the
   aperture. The area where the phase was not retarded was of a double
   annular type. The MTF curves for the phase-modulated aperture were
   compared with those for an unmodulated aperture. We found an
   aberration-compensation effect in the aberration-loaded system. The
   results of this research indicate that the performance of many optical
   systems can be improved without any loss of light energy by properly
   modulating the phase on the aperture.}},

Abstract = {{We report measurements of the equilibrium D/H fractionation factor
   (alpha) between methane and hydrogen in the temperature range 200-500
   degrees C, Isotopic equilibrium was achieved by recycling the gases over
   a Ni-Thoria catalyst, using an in-line sampling volume for sequestering
   aliquots of the gas mixture without contributions from adsorbed gases on
   the catalyst, Equilibrium values of cr were approached from both sides
   by use of (1) enriched CH3D in the initial mixture and (2)
   pre-equilibration of the gases at temperatures below that of the final
   equilibrium mixture. The measured values of alpha are linear vs. 1/T-2
   and fit the equation alpha = 0.8994 + 183,540/T-2, with a standard
   deviation sigma = +/-12.5\%.
   The D/H fractionation factors for water vapor-hydrogen exchange measured
   by Suess (1949) and by Cerrai et al. (1954) are also linear in alpha vs.
   1/T-2 over the temperature range of the data: comparison with published
   D/H ratios in high-temperature (1127 degrees C) volcanic gases at
   Surtsey volcano shows that the Suess (1949) data are much closer to the
   observed ratios in H-2 and H2O. The Suess (1949) measurements (80-200
   degrees C) are also much closer to the theoretical values calculated by
   Bardo and Wolfsberg (1976), which fit the observed Surtsey
   fractionations slightly better than the extrapolated Suess (1949)
   results. We conclude that (1) the Suess (1949) measurements are the
   better set of experimental data, (2) the Surtsey gases are close to
   isotopic equilibrium at the vent temperatures, and (3) the Bardo and
   Wolfsberg (1976) theoretical equation gives the best representation of
   the H2O-H-2 fractionation factors. This equation is combined with the
   Horita and Wesolowski (1994) equation for H2O liquid-vapor fractionation
   factors and can be used with the CH4-H-2 alpha values to determine
   whether concordant temperatures are observed in the system CH4H2-H2O.
   Application to the D/H ratios in the East Pacific Rise hydrothermal
   vents measured by Welhan and Craig (1979) shows that concordant
   temperatures are obtained for both CH4-H-2 and H2O-H-2 data, and are
   close to the approximate vent temperatures (similar to 350 degrees C).
   We note that fractionation equations in which alpha, rather than 1n
   alpha, is fit to powers of T are much more useful for geochemical
   studies because the precision estimate is uniform over the entire
   temperature range of the data..}},

   revealed that participants' were knowledgeable about tattoos and the
   process, and were aware that viral transmission and physical
   disfigurement were possible results. Generally, attitudes toward tattoos
   were negative, with almost all participants associating them with
   illicit type activities. However, a more favorable attitude toward small
   tattoos was discernible among females during early adolescence.
   Participants suggested that because of the location of tattoos, they
   might be embarrassing in some instances, and that because of their

Abstract = {{The CELIAS experiment on SOHO is designed to measure the mass, ionic
   charge and energy of the low and high speed solar wind, of suprathermal
   ions, and of low energy flare particles. Through analysis of the
   elemental and isotopic abundances, the ionic charge state, and the
   velocity distributions of ions originating in the solar atmosphere, the
   investigation focuses on the plasma processes on various temporal and
   spatial scales in the solar chromosphere, transition zone, and corona.
   CELIAS includes 3 mass- and charge-discriminating sensors based on the
   time-of-flight technique: CTOF for the elemental, charge and velocity
   distribution of the solar wind, MTOF for the elemental and isotopic
   composition of the solar wind, and STOF for the mass, charge and energy
   distribution of suprathermal ions. The instrument will provide detailed
   in situ diagnostics of the solar wind and of accelerated particles,
   which will complement the optical and spectroscopic investigations of
   the solar atmosphere on SOHO. CELIAS also contains a Solar Extreme
   Ultraviolet Monitor, SEM, which continuously measures the EUV flux in a
   wide band of 17-170 nm,and a narrow band around the 30.4 nm He II line.}},

Abstract = {{We have examined sources of error and techniques for error avoidance in
   Schottky barrier surface photovoltage measurements. In particular we
   have used a computer simulation approach to gauge the errors in the
   method A formalism, which is applied to analyzing constant open-circuit
   voltage measurements, and in the method B formalism, which is applied to
   analyzing constant light flux measurements. As a result of this
   analysis, we have shown we can eliminate the extreme measurement
   precautions necessitated by method B through the use of a new method C
   formalism which is introduced here. We also show that, for measured
   diffusion lengths less than one-third the sample thickness, the
   measurement is shown to be forgiving of the state of the back contact if
   that surface has flat or accumulated bands; however, if the back surface
   is rectifying, the range of the measurement validity can be affected by
   the magnitude of the front contact barrier height, even with the
   measured diffusion length less than one-third the sample thickness.}},

   a response-moment method, in which response moments are solved through a
   series of simultaneous equations. This approach requires that a general
   response moment equation suitable for non-Gaussian/Gaussian,
   parametric/external excitations be developed. Two problems related to
   second-order linear systems are explored and their closed-form solutions
   for response moments up to fourth order are obtained. The first problem
   considers systems subjected to `'physical'' Gaussian white-noise
   parametric excitations together with non-Gaussian delta-correlated
   external excitations. The second problem considers both parametric and
   external excitations that are non-Gaussian and delta-correlated.}},

Abstract = {{The reverse cholesterol transport is initiated by the uptake of

   beta(1)-LpA-I and gamma-LpE, respectively, cell-derived cholesterol is
   transferred to LDL via the bulk of HDL termed alpha-LpA-I, In this study
   we analyzed the effect in plasma of the genetically determined apoE
   polymorphism on the formation of gamma-LpE, uptake and transfer of
   cell-derived cholesterol to LDL, gamma-LpE was immunologically
   detectable in plasmas of individuals carrying at least one apoE3-allele
   but not in apoE3-free plasmas. During one minute incubation with {[}H-3]
   cholesterol-labeled fibroblasts, gamma-LpE of plasmas from apoE3/3
   subjects accumulated 7-and 13-fold more radioactivity than the
   respective fractions in plasmas from apoE2/2- and apoE4/4-subjects,
   respectively, Totally, 30\% less {[}3H]cholesterol was released into
   plasmas of apoE2/2 and apoE4/4-individuals as compared with plasmas of

   50\% and 65\% more cell-derived {[}H-3] cholesterol in alpha-LpA-I-2

Abstract = {{Three synthetic peptides (Nos 9, 10 and 18) representing
   surface-esposed, linear B-cell epitopes of outer membrane protein F of
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa were each conjugated to the carriers keyhole
   limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and bovine serum albumin (BSA), with the
   conjugates being used to immunize mice intranasally, Mice were also
   immunized intranasally with a KLH/BSA carrier control or with a peptide
   No. 8 conjugate as a negative control. An immunoglobulin G response
   reactive with P. aeruginosa whole cells was demonstrated by
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of sera from mice immunized
   with peptide 9, 10 or 18, whereas no whole-cell reactivity by ELISA was
   detected in sera from mice immunized with peptide 8. Upon pulmonary
   challenge of immunized mice with a Fisher-Devlin immunotype 4 strain of
   P. aeruginosa, only those mice immunized with peptide 9 or peptide 10
   had a significantly greater survival rate compared to control mice
   immunized with the carriers alone, Peptides 9 (TDAYNQKLSERRAN) and 10
   (NATAEGRAINRRVE) have potential for further development as a protective
   vaccine against P, aeruginosa infections.}},

Abstract = {{Because metals occur in various forms in the environment, speciation is
   an issue which must be addressed in regulatory health risk assessment
   programs. The manner in which speciation was addressed in a federal
   program in Canada is discussed in this article. Under the Canadian
   Environmental Protection Act, four metals, including arsenic, cadmium,
   chromium, and nickel, and their compounds were assessed as priority
   substances to determine the risk to human health associated with
   exposure to levels present in the general environment in Canada. The
   extent to which the speciation of these metals could be considered in
   these assessments was largely determined by the nature of available
   data. Very few data were identified on speciation in environmental media
   to which humans are exposed. Based on available data on health effects,
   it was possible to conduct assessments on only one form each of arsenic
   and cadmium (i.e., inorganic arsenic and inorganic cadmium), two forms
   of chromium (trivalent and hexavalent), and four forms of inorganic
   nickel (oxidic, sulfidic, soluble, and metallic). (C) 1995 Academic

Abstract = {{A number of dramatic changes have been documented in the insulin-like
   growth factors (IGFs-I and -II) and their binding proteins (IGFBPs)
   during pregnancy. In this study we have tested the hypothesis that a
   failure of the normal proteolytic modification of IGFBP-3 is responsible
   for gestational diabetes by examining serum samples taken in the third
   trimester from 29 women with uncomplicated pregnancies, 21 women with
   established Type 1 diabetes and 20 women with gestational diabetes.
   Analysis of IGFBP-3 by Western immunoblotting revealed that it was
   present in a modified form, migrating at around 29 kDa, in the
   circulation of all of the women investigated. Semi-quantification of the
   activity of the protease which modifies the IGFBP-3 demonstrated
   considerable variation between individuals in their ability to fragment
   radiolabelled IGFBP-3 following a 45-min co-incubation. Surprisingly, in
   one individual (with gestational diabetes) there was no detectable
   protease activity even though her endogenous IGFBP-3 had been modified.
   However, overall there was no clear-cut difference in protease activity
   between the different groups. Radioimmunometric analysis of IGF-I
   revealed significantly higher levels in women with gestational diabetes
   than either of the other two groups (P<0.05). Similarly IGFBP-3 levels
   were also increased in these same women (P<0.05). In contrast, IGF-II
   levels did not alter between the three groups.
   In conclusion, our hypothesis was not supported by these data and
   gestational diabetes was found not to be associated with any reduction
   in the activity of the circulating IGFBP-3 protease which could have
   decreased the availability of the IGF nor with any alteration in IGFs
   which could explain the onset of diabetes in these women.}},

Abstract = {{It has long been recognized that conflict within channels of
   distribution can be either functional or dysfunctional. What is lacking

   processing to the channel literature to explain how channel members form
   schema against which new information about a specific channel member is
   compared. The comparison of new information against an existing schema
   influences whether a specific conflict episode has the potential of
   being viewed as functional or dysfunctional. This article develops the
   notion that both individual boundary personnel and the organization form
   schema. In addition, this article contends that the organization's
   schema is a `'superordinate'' schema that is conveyed to the individual
   boundary personnel, and acts as the primary mechanism used to compare
   incoming information. A model of this process and managerial
   implications are presented. Propositions are developed throughout the

   Effects of range substructure}},
Journal = {{HEREDITY}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{549-560}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Gene flow in the annual aquatic plant, Eichhornia paniculata, was
   inferred from estimates of genetic differentiation at 24 isozyme loci
   among 44 populations from north-east Brazil. Population differentiation,
   estimated as the correlation among genes of different individuals (phi),
   was 0.45 (range among loci, 0.10-0.69). Based on Wright's island model,
   this heterogeneity would result from gene flow equivalent to 0.31
   immigrants (Nm) entering each population per generation. The
   distribution of E. paniculata in north-eastern Brazil is geographically
   and genetically subdivided, and therefore, the assumption that migrants
   are a random draw from all populations is likely to be violated for this
   range-wide estimate of gene flow. We investigated the importance of
   range subdivision on indirect estimates of gene flow through computer
   simulation and through a hierarchical analysis of F-ST and Nm in
   populations of E. paniculata from northeastern Brazil.
   Simulations indicated that estimates of Nm in the presence of range
   substructure consistently underestimated the actual values of gene flow.
   The degree to which Nm was underestimated increased in proportion to the
   magnitude of genetic differentiation among range subdivisions. In E.
   paniculata, northern and southern regions of the geographical range and
   local clusters within regions were genetically differentiated (phi =
   0.10, phi = 0.14, respectively) and there was a strong negative
   relationship between Nm estimated for pairs of populations and the
   geographical distance between them. Average estimates of population
   differentiation decreased and gene flow increased with successive
   reductions in spatial scale, from the complete range sampled (Nm =
   0.31), to regions (Nm = 0.44), to local areas within regions (Nm =
   0.64), and to neighbouring population pairs within local areas (Nm =
   0.58). Similarity in estimates for neighbouring pairs and local areas
   suggests that, below the spatial scale of local area, gene flow
   estimates are not influenced by range substructure and can be considered
   to occur at random. Our results suggest that range substructure can have
   a substantial influence on gene flow estimates, and that ecologically
   relevant rates are likely to be higher than those indicated by
   range-wide analyses in organisms with geographical subdivision.}},

Abstract = {{A chromogenic mimic of phenlyalanyl-dipeptide,
   L-phenylalanyl-L-2-sulfanilylglycine (PSG), was synthesized and examined
   for its usability in leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) assay. The enzyme
   activity was easily determined by measuring the amount of diazotized
   adduct of sulfanilic acid released upon hydrolysis of PSC
   (epsilon(420)=18,000/M/cm). Under the experimental conditions employed,
   PSG showed a Km of 0.063 mM and a Kcat of 1683/min, assessable less than
   0.1 mu g of LAP per milliliter. And the presence of aminopeptidase M
   (APM) was suggested to be negligible in LAP assay. This novel assay can
   circumvent the occasional yellow background in biological systems, i.e.,
   serums, etc..}},

Abstract = {{We investigated expression of macrophage
   galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine-specific C-type lectin (MMGL) in normal
   mouse lung tissue and in lungs with metastatic nodules produced by
   OV2944-HM-1 mouse metastatic ovarian tumour cells. Cells expressing MMGL
   were detected in tissue sections using a rat monoclonal antibody (mAb)
   specific for MMGL, mAb LOM-14. The regions containing cells
   immunostained using mAb LOM-14 were restricted to the connective tissue
   surrounding blood vessels and respiratory epithelia, whereas alveolar
   regions of lung parenchyma were essentially devoid of these cells. In
   contrast, a significant number of cells in the alveolar regions was
   shown to express Mac-1 antigen (CD11b/CD18) and leucocyte common antigen
   (CD45). Immunoelectron microscopic study revealed the presence of MMGL
   in the intracellular vesicles of cells residing in connective tissue. In
   the tumour-bearing mice, MMGL-positive cells were also present within
   metastatic nodules. Their localization outside of the nodules was
   restricted to connective tissue. Cells with Mac-1 antigens were seen
   both in the nodules and in the alveolar regions. These results indicate
   that MMGL serves as a unique macrophage marker in mouse lung tissue due
   to its topographical site-dependent pattern of expression. The present
   results also suggest a possible involvement of macrophages expressing
   MMGL in the immune response directed against metastatic tumour cells.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new design methodology, complexity tailored
   degn, for databases containing incomplete information. The novelty of
   the approach is that it introduces query complexity as a consideration
   in database design. In general, the problem of evaluating queries in
   databases with incomplete information is intractable. Complexity
   tailored design consists in setting the values of database design
   parameters so as to guarantee the efficient (polynomial time)
   evaluability of selected queries. We develop this approach for
   OR-databases, which are obtained by extending relational databases with
   OR-objects that express restricted disjunctions; OR-objects occur
   naturally in planning. scheduling and design applications. We consider
   two design parameters: (i) typing that delimits the columns in which
   OR-objects may occur, and (ii) degree of co-reference that determines
   how OR-objects may be repeated within the database. We establish, for a
   broad class of queries in OR-databases, a complete syntactic
   characterization that classifies the data complexity of each query as
   being either in PTIME or co-NP complete, given a setting of the database
   design parameters. This characterization can then be used in complexity
   tailored design to determine `'maximal'' schemata for which the queries
   of interest to the user are evaluable in PTIME. (C) 1995 Academic Press,

Journal = {{MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS JIM}},

Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{The composition ranges of Zr-Cu-B and Zr-Cu-Ga amorphous alloys and
   their supercooled liquid region (Delta T-x) and reduced glass transition
   temperature(T-g/T-m) were examined in comparison with those for Zr-Cu-Al
   amorphous alloys. The glass formation range, Delta T-x and T-g/T-m
   decrease in the order Al>Ga>B. However, the addition of a small amount
   (5 at\%) of B or Ga for the Zr-TM (TM=Co, Ni, Cu) base alloys is
   effective for the increase in a Delta T-x and the largest Delta T-x
   value is 65 K for Zr65Ni10Cu20B5 and 73 K for Zr65Co5Cu25Ga5 which are
   larger than that (60 K) for Zr65Ni10Cu20Al5. The crystallization of the
   B- or Ga-containing alloy takes place through a single stage due to the
   polymorphous precipitation of bct Zr-2(Ni, Cu, B) or bet Zr-2(Co, Cu,
   Ga) while the Al-containing alloy shows a two-stage process of Am-->Am'
   + metastable cubic Zr-2(Ni, Al)-->bct Zr-2(Ni, Al)+ bct Zr-2(Cu, Al).
   The addition of B, Ga or Al to the Zr-65(Co, Ni, Cu)(30)Al-5 alloy
   causes the further increase in a Delta T-x to 84, 90 and 104 K
   respectively, and the crystallization process consists of the
   polymorphous-type single stage. The reason why the Zr-Cu-B ternary
   amorphous alloys have the lower glass-forming ability and smaller Delta
   T-x value among the three Zr-Cu-M (M=B, Ga or Al) ternary systems is
   presumably because Cu-B pair has a positive heat of mixing and the
   atomic size ratios between B and Zr or Cu are too large to construct a
   higher degree of dense random packed structure. This is consistent with
   the previous result that the dissolution of Al with large negative heats
   of mixing and different atomic size ratios causes the formation of a
   higher degree of dense random packed structure and the Delta T-x value
   increases further for the Zr-Cu-Al amorphous alloys containing a larger
   amount of Al. These results support the previous concept that the
   simultaneous satisfaction of the significantly different atomic size
   ratios and large negative heats of mixing is necessary for the formation
   of an amorphous alloy with a wide supercooled liquid region before
   crystallization.}},

Abstract = {{Digital signal processing algorithms are repetitive in nature. These
   algorithms are described by iterative data-flow graphs where nodes
   represent computations and edges represent communications. For all
   dataflow graphs, there exists a fundamental lower bound on the iteration
   period referred to as the iteration bound. Determining the iteration
   bound for signal processing algorithms described by iterative data-flow
   graphs is an important problem. In this paper we review two existing
   algorithms for determination of the iteration bound. Then we propose
   another novel method based on the minimum cycle mean algorithm to
   determine the iteration bound with a lower polynomial time complexity
   than the two existing techniques, It is convenient to represent many
   multi-rate signal processing algorithms by multi-rate data-flow graphs,
   The iteration bound of a multi-rate data-flow graph (MRDFG) can be
   determined by considering the single-rate data-flow graph (SRDFG)
   equivalent of the MRDFG. However, the equivalent single-rate data-flow
   graph contains many redundant nodes and edges. The iteration bound of
   the MRDFG can be determined faster if these redundancies in the
   equivalent SRDFG are first removed. A previous approach has considered
   elimination of edge redundancy. In this paper we present an approach to
   eliminate node redundancy in the MRDFG. We combine elimination of node
   and edge redundancies to propose a novel algorithm for faster
   determination of the iteration bound of the MRDFG.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the effect of operational sex ratio on female reluctance and
   male persistence to mate as well as on the length of copulation and
   postcopulatory guarding in Gen's lacustris by adding five surplus males
   or females to the basin with a pair in tandem. In the control treatment,
   a pair alone was tested. According to the copulatory guarding hypothesis
   (CGH), males should prolong mating and guard females in the presence of
   surplus males. According to the convenience polyandry hypothesis (CPH),
   females should show lower levels of resistance to prolonged mating in
   the presence of surplus males because the mating male protects the
   female against harassment from other males. As expected on the basis of
   both the CGH and CPH, mating (copulation + guarding) averaged longer in
   the male-biased treatment. The behavior of males and females during
   mating suggested that both hypotheses hold true: females showed less
   resistance to prolonged mating (as predicted from CPH), and male
   behavior suggested stronger efforts to stay on the female when surplus
   males were present (as predicted from CGH). Comparisons of the treatment
   with surplus females with the results from the mating pair without
   surplus individuals suggested that the capabilities of water striders in
   tandem to assess the sex of nearby nonmating striders are limited.}},

Abstract = {{We present models of the microstructure of martensite that occurs when
   twinned layers of martensite meet a pure variant. This microstructure
   often occurs below the A(s) temperature, with loading that favors the
   passage from one pure variant of martensite to another. This
   microstructure gives a mechanism for variant rearrangement. In this
   microstructure, the layers are observed to pinch down to sharply pointed
   needles. If the laminate is sufficiently long, branching of the needles
   is observed. In materials with a reasonably large transformation strain,
   the needles exhibit a characteristic bent shape; the bending is in the
   opposite sense as might be expected from the overall shear. Our
   analytical and numerical results imply that this microstructure forms as
   a result of energy minimization in the transition layer between the
   martensite laminate and the pure variant. The bending of the needles
   plays a key role in lowering the energy of this transition layer.}},

Abstract = {{We present an integrated device fabrication sequence for GaAs/AlGaAs
   resonant tunneling diodes and the results of de and microwave
   characterization of the integrated devices. The development of an
   integrated structure represents a first step toward monolithic or hybrid
   integration for applications such as oscillators in the 100 GHz-1 THz
   range. The use of a proton implant in addition to a mesa etch for device
   isolation allows low parasitic capacitance connections to bond pads,
   interconnects, or radiating elements. The dc and microwave measurement
   procedures and an equivalent circuit topology for the integrated device
   are described. Several features associated with the integrated geometry,
   including a decrease in peak current density with increasing device
   diameter, are observed in a study of the current-voltage characteristics
   of devices with various diameters. Contact resistances are determined
   from a physically based model and compared with experimental results.
   Microwave characterization techniques are used to obtain microwave
   equivalent circuit parameters for the integrated diodes. Device
   capacitance and conductance are presented as functions of device
   dimension and bias voltage. Parasitic circuit elements, including series
   resistance and a capacitance and resistance associated with the proton
   bombardment used to define the mesa, are also determined from the
   microwave analysis. The results obtained from microwave impedance
   measurements are compared with parameters obtained from de
   characterization and numerical simulations of comparable device

Abstract = {{EMS-186318 is a member of the recently discovered `'aminodiol'' class of
   HIV protease inhibitors. A simple but sensitive method was developed for
   the determination of EMS-186318 in dog plasma and then applied to monkey
   and rat plasma. The compound was extracted from dog plasma with methyl
   tert-butyl ether at basic pH. The dried extract was reconstituted in
   mobile phase and injected into a 150 x 2.1 mm i.d. Zorbax Rx-C-18 HPLC
   column. A portion of the effluent was directed into the LC-ionspray MS
   system, where the {[}M + H](+) ion of the secondary amine compound was
   monitored. The HPLC conditions were chosen in order to achieve a short
   run time and large sample throughput, with both analyte and internal
   standard eluting within 1.5 min. The liquid-liquid extraction procedure
   provided very clean extracts so that sufficient signal-to-noise ratio
   was obtained with single-stage mass spectrometry instead of the more
   costly tandem mass spectrometry. The required lower limit of
   quantitation of 2.5 ng ml(-1) was easily achieved. The method has also
   been validated for EMS-186318 in monkey plasma without modification. The
   method has been modified for rat plasma. Owing to irreproducibility
   observed when applying the liquid-liquid extraction method to rat
   plasma, a solid-phase extraction method was developed. The addition of
   phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was necessary to stabilize EMS-186318 in
   rat blood and plasma.}},

Abstract = {{We examined interspecies differences in the function of the platelet
   fibrinogen receptor, GPIIb-IIIa, by comparing platelet aggregation
   responses to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) added alone or in combination
   with a GPIIIa specific monoclonal antibody (mAb), D3. D3 can activate
   the GPIIb-IIIa receptor in the absence of platelet activation, and it
   preferentially binds to a region on the GPIIIa subunit after the
   GPIlb-IIIa complex is occupied by ligand. Using human, monkey, dog,
   rabbit and pig platelets, we examined whether all species' platelets
   bound the D3 mAb similarly, and if the binding of Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS)
   peptides induced the exposure of the anti-LIES (D3) epitope as
   previously described for human platelets. We also evaluated how blocking
   of this neoantigenic region by the D3 mAb affected clot retraction, a
   process that requires linkage of GPIIb-IIIa with fibrin(ogen) and the
   platelet cytoskeleton. We found that all species tested bound the D3
   mAb. Only in human and monkey platelets did D3 cause aggregation as well
   as inhibit clot retraction. However, in all species tested, except for
   pig, D3 prevented disaggregation of platelets typically observed when
   platelets are treated with low dose ADP. With the exception of pig
   platelets, there was increased D3 binding to platelets in the presence
   of RGDS peptides. We propose that this region of GPIIIa is important in
   the conformational changes that GPIIb-IIIa undergoes during the binding
   of ligand in most species tested. Our studies suggest 1) there are
   measurable inter-species differences in GPIIb-IIIa mediated platelet
   aggregation and clot retraction, 2) LIES expression due to receptor
   occupancy is a common but not all-inclusive response and 3) interspecies
   comparisons may be useful in understanding structural and functional
   aspects of platelet GPIIb-IIIa.}},

Abstract = {{Neisseria meningitidis, but not Haemophilus influenzae, damage cultured
   human endothelial cells. We have undertaken a study to generate
   genetically and structurally defined lipopolysaccharide (LPS) mutant
   strains of meningococci for functional studies to assess the role of
   surface exposed oligosaccharides in imparting specificity of toxic
   damage to human endothelial cells. The lsi1 gene, which had been shown
   to be involved in LPS biosynthesis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, was
   amplified by PCR and cloned. Nucleotide sequence analysis confirmed the
   identity of the clone and revealed homology with lsi1 of N. gonorrhoeae
   and the rfaF gene of Salmonella typhimurium which encodes a
   heptosyl-2-transferase involved in LPS biosynthesis. The identity of the
   cloned Isi1 gene, as a functional rfaF homologue, was confirmed by the
   complementation of a S. typhimurium rfaF mutant using a P22 phage
   sensitivity test. An lsi1 mutant meningococcal strain was constructed,
   and structural analysis of the mutant LPS molecule revealed a single
   heptose in the core structure, consistent with a heptosyl-2-transferase
   deficient mutant. In order to investigate the relative cytotoxicities of
   meningococci expressing native and altered LPS, wild type, lsi1, and
   galE strains were compared in cytotoxicity assays using human umbilical
   vein endothelial cells (Huvecs) in culture. Analysis using Huvecs
   derived from several individuals (cords) showed that the three
   phenotypes were almost equally cytotoxic. Removal of the terminal
   portion (galE mutant) or the majority (Isi mutant) of the
   oligosaccharide did not effect LPS-mediated cytopathic damage to Huvecs
   in a culture suggesting that the oligosaccharide portion did not play a
   major role in cytotoxicity. (C) 1995 Academic Press Limited.}},

   lens was sutured in an aphakic eye and 20 lenses were sutured after
   removal of an anterior chamber lens, Postoperative follow-up averaged 13
   months (2-39 months). Visual acuity improved in 20 patients (95\%) and
   remained the same in 1 patient (5\%). Postoperative visual acuity was
   less than 0.1 in 5 patients (23.8\%), 0.1 to 0.33 in 14 patients
   (66.7\%) and better than 0.33 in 2 patients (9.5\%). Twelve patients
   (57.1\%) expressed a substantial reduction in ocular pain, 7 patients
   (33.3\%) had no pain either before or after the operation, 2 patients
   (9.5\%) expressed no reduction in pain, No cases of endophthalmitis,
   choroidal hemorrhage or retinal detachment were found. In one case, the
   sutured lens was dislocated without disturbing vision. Intraocular
   pressure increased in 3 of 9 patients with preoperative glaucoma,
   New-onset glaucoma developed in 1 patient. We find transscleral fixation
   of a posterior chamber lens to be an acceptable procedure in penetrating
   keratoplasty with IOL implantation where capsular support is inadequate
   for conventional implantation of a posterior chamber lens.}},

Abstract = {{To study the population structure of tusk Brosme brosme in the North
   Atlantic, samples from six fishing grounds were collected: St Kilda;
   Storegga; Faroe Islands; Rockall bank; Davis Strait and East Greenland.
   In addition two samples from the Norwegian coast; Kragero and Oygarden,
   were included. Nine enzymes and haemoglobin were analysed by starch gel
   and agar gel electrophoresis. In addition isoelectric focusing (IEF) was
   carried out. At least 22 loci were represented. Polymorphisms were shown
   in eight loci and average heterozygosity was found to be about 0.05.
   Highest heterozygosity was found in haemoglobin analysed by Smithies
   buffer pH 8.6. Malate dehydrogenase (MDH-2) analysed in IEF (pH
   3.5-9.5), and haemoglobin were found as valuable tools for studies of
   stock structure in tusk. In the Greenland samples only one of the MDH-2
   heterozygotes was found, while in the East Atlantic both the observed
   heterozygotes were more frequent. The frequencies of the the Hb{*}b
   allele were about 0.40 and 0.70 in the samples from east and west
   Atlantic respectively. (C) 1995 The Fisheries Society of the British

   groups are both staggered relative to the central SiH2 group, but a
   twist of about 13 degrees of the SiBr3 groups relative to the exactly
   staggered position reduces the symmetry to C-2. From the vibrational
   spectra a distinction between C-2 Or C-2v symmetry is possible, and
   point group C-2v can be ruled out by arguments based on the selection
   rules. Bond lengths (r(g)) and valence angles (angle(a)lpha) are:
   r(Si-Si) = 2.344(18)Angstrom, r(Si-Br) = 2.205(4)Angstrom angle SiSiSi =

   Error limits are given as 2 sigma where sigma includes estimates of
   uncertainties in voltage/height measurements and correlation in the

   The infrared and Raman vibrational spectra have been assigned using
   normal coordinate calculations as well as ab initio calculations, and

Title = {{The use of a virtual configuration in formulating constitutive equations

Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{41}},

Pages = {{177-215}},

Abstract = {{Residual stress is the stress present in the unloaded equilibrium
   configuration of a body. Because residual stresses can significantly
   affect the mechanical behavior of a component, the measurement of these
   stresses and the prediction of their effect on mechanical behavior are
   important objectives in many engineering problems. Common methods for
   the measurement of residual stresses include various destructive
   experiments in which the body is cut to relieve the residual stress. The
   resulting strain is measured and used to approximate the original
   residual stress in the intact body. In order to predict the mechanical
   behavior of a residually stressed body, a constitutive model is required
   that includes the influence of the residual stress.
   In this paper we present a method by which the data obtained from
   standard destructive experiments can be used to derive constitutive
   equations that describe the mechanical behavior of elastic residually
   stressed bodies. The derivation is based on the idea that for each
   infinitesimal neighborhood in a residually stressed body, there exists a
   corresponding stress free configuration. We refer to this stress free
   configuration as the `virtual' configuration of the infinitesimal
   neighborhood. The derivation requires that the constitutive equation for
   the stress free material be known and invertible; it is used to relate
   the residual stress to the deformation of the virtual configuration into
   the residually stressed configuration. Although the concept of the
   virtual configuration is central to the derivation, the geometry of this
   configuration need not be determined explicitly, and it need not be
   achievable experimentally, in order to construct the constitutive
   equation for the residually stressed body.
   The general mathematical forms of constitutive equations valid for
   residually stressed elastic materials have been derived previously for a
   number of cases. These general forms contain numerous unknown
   material-response functions or material constants that must be
   determined experimentally. In contrast, the method presented here
   results in a constitutive equation that is an explicit function of
   residual stress and includes only the material parameters required to
   describe the stress free material.
   After presenting the method for the derivation of constitutive
   equations, we explore the relationship between destructive experiments
   and the theory used in the derivation. Specifically, we discuss the use
   of the theory to improve the design of destructive experiments, and the
   use of destructive experiments to obtain the data required to construct
   the constitutive equation for a particular material.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to determine the comparative efficacy and
   safety of intra-articular (i/a) triamcinolone hexacetonide (TH) and i/a
   hyaluronic acid (HA) in inflammatory knee osteoarthritis. A randomized
   double-blind comparative trial was carried out in a rheumatology
   outpatient department. There were 63 patients (24 male, 39 female, mean
   age 70.5 years) with bilateral symptomatic knee osteoarthritis with
   effusion. Each was given five RA injections at weekly intervals; or 20
   mg TH followed by four placebo (saline) injections. Patients were
   examined weekly during the treatment period and then at monthly
   intervals for a further 6 months. Assessment included recording of:
   visual analog scores (VAS) for pain; duration of stiffness; range of
   movement; joint effusion; local heat; synovial thickening; joint-line
   and periarticular tenderness. The principal outcome measure was pain on
   a self-selected activity assessed by VAS. The two groups were comparable
   at entry and no significant differences between the groups developed at
   any time during the treatment period. However there was a high drop-out
   rate and intention to treat analysis failed to demonstrate statistically
   significant differences between the groups. In patients remaining in the
   study, significantly less pain was experienced by the HA group during
   the 6 month follow-up period. Other parameters showed a similar trend in
   favor of HA. We could not, however, demonstrate significant differences
   between the placebo and active treatments. HA may therefore be a useful
   additional therapy for symptomatic knee osteoarthritis and may have a
   long duration of action.}},

Abstract = {{Human furin catalyzes the proteolytic maturation of many proproteins in
   the exocytic and endocytic secretory pathways by cleavage at the
   C-terminal side of the consensus sequence -ArgXaaLys/ArgArg down arrow-.
   Both the trans-Golgi network (TGN) concentration and intracellular
   routing of furin require sequences in its 56 amino acid cytoplasmic
   tail, Here, we show that the furin cytoplasmic tail contains multiple
   trafficking signals. Localization to the TGN requires a cluster of
   acidic amino acids that, together with a pair of serine residues, forms
   a casein kinase II (CK II) phosphorylation site, We show that CK II
   efficiently phosphorylates these serines in vitro, and using a
   permeabilized cell system we provide evidence that CK II is the in vivo
   furin kinase, Analysis by mass spectrometry shows that, in vivo, furin
   exists as di-, mono- and nonphosphorylated forms, Finally, employing (i)
   furin constructs that mimic either non-phosphorylated or phosphorylated
   furin and (ii) the phosphatase inhibitor tautomycin, we show that the
   phosphorylation state of the furin cytoplasmic tail modulates retrieval
   of the endoprotease to the TGN, Thus, routing of furin is a two-tiered
   process combining a set of trafficking signals comprised of the primary
   amino acid sequence of the tail with its phosphorylation state.}},

   compositions has been explored to understand the oxidation protection
   mechanisms and the role of structure and composition in the oxidation
   behavior. Thin films of (Ti-1-x,Al-x) N have been sputter deposited on
   silicon substrates and the nature of oxides resulting from air oxidation
   at various temperatures has been evaluated using Auger electron
   spectroscopy. In most of the films, layered oxide structures Al2O3/TiO2
   readily form on the nitride surface at about 800 degrees C and higher
   temperatures. At about 700 degrees C and below, the oxidation product is
   primarily a mixed oxide, such as Al2O3 + TiO2. Oxides forming at
   elevated temperatures, with a top layer of Al2O3, protect the underlying
   nitride from further oxidation. Thus, for low and intermediate
   temperature applications, the titanium-aluminium nitride films may be
   first treated at an elevated temperature to form a protective oxide. The
   role of aluminum content in the film oxidation behavior has been
   explored for x values ranging from 0.25 to 0.67. Despite its higher
   aluminum content, the (Ti-0.33,Al-0.67) N film exhibited lower oxidation

   proportional to M(-0.8). Further, matrix dissolution is considered
   similar to the dissolution of an object immersed in a fluid. As a
   result, a diffusion layer separating the matrix from the bulk solution
   is incorporated into the transport regime. An anisotropic expansion
   model is also introduced to account for the anisotropic expansion of the
   matrix where surface area in the radial direction dominates over the
   axial surface area. The model predicts that the overall tablet size and
   the characteristic swelling time correlate with rho(p,dis)
   qualitatively. Two scaling laws are established for fractional polymer
   (m(p)(t)/m(p)(infinity)) and drug (m(d)(t)/m(d)(infinity)) released as
   m(p)(t)/m(p)(infinity) proportional to M(-1.05) and
   m(d)(t)/m(d)(infinity) proportional to M(-0.24), consistent with the
   limiting polymer molecular weight effect on drug release. Model
   predictions for polymer and drug release agree well with observations,
   within 15\% error. Evolution of water concentration profiles and the
   detailed structure of a swollen matrix are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the design and implementation of a knowledge-based
   decision support system (KBDSS) in the facility location domain. The
   KBDSS for locating a manufacturing facility is intended to support
   facilities planners in improving the quality of strategic
   decision-making in facility location. A survey of past location studies
   was conducted to identify the major considerations of location analysts
   and to develop a hierarchy of factors for locating a manufacturing
   facility in the USA. Location evaluation is accomplished via a location
   model that is formulated as a linear additive multiattribute utility
   model. The microcomputer-based DSS developed integrates an
   object-oriented expert system with other modeling tools, such as a
   database management system and a C-based interactive graphical user
   interface. The system incorporates subjective, judgemental evaluations
   from management with objective, factual location data to recommend the
   best location for a new manufacturing facility. The system also makes
   transparent the justification for its recommendations by providing
   appropriate textual and graphical explanation facilities.}},

Abstract = {{To identify the factors influencing the serum concentrations and the
   peritoneal clearances of low molecular weight proteins (LMWP), fourteen
   patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) for 1 to 57
   (mean 9.4) months were examined. LMWP {[}beta(2)-microglobulin
   (beta(2)m, molecular wt 11.8 kD), cystatin C (cyst C, molecular wt 13.2
   kD). Clara cell protein (CCl6, molecular wt 15.8 kD), retinol-binding
   protein (REP, molecular wt 21 kD) and alpha 1-microglobulin (alpha(1)m,
   molecular wt 33 kD)] and high molecular weight proteins (HMWP)
   {[}albumin (Alb, molecular wt 66 kD), immunoglobulins (IgG, molecular wt
   170 kD and IgM, molecular wt 600 kD) and alpha 2-macroglobulin
   (alpha(2)m, molecular wt 718 kD)] were determined by latex immunoassay
   in the serum and dialysate collected during the peritoneal equilibration
   test (PET) with 2.27\% dextrose (N = 14), and in dialysate from 56
   standard exchanges, performed the day preceding PET, with 1.36\% (N =
   21), 2.27\% (N = 23) and 3.86\% (N = 12) dextrose. Determinants of serum
   concentrations and transperitoneal clearances of the proteins were
   traced by stepwise regression analysis using as possible contributors
   age, sex, residual diuresis, duration of the therapy (for serum
   concentrations), molecular radius of the protein and peritoneal membrane
   characteristics (for peritoneal clearances). LMWP serum concentrations
   were markedly increased whereas serum concentrations of HMWP were within
   the normal range. Residual diuresis, age and duration of dialysis
   emerged as significant determinants of serum concentration of some
   proteins, whereas transperitoneal clearance was dependent mainly on the
   size of the protein and, only for HMWP, on the dwell time. Residual
   diuresis was inversely related to the serum concentrations of four LMWP.
   Age was negatively correlated to the serum concentrations of beta(2)m,
   CCl6 and REP. REP and Alb were the only proteins whose serum
   concentration significantly decreased with time on CAPD. The
   relationship between peritoneal clearance and M(r) shows two slopes
   suggesting the existence of two populations of pores in the peritoneal
   capillary wall: small pores of about 20 to 25 Angstrom radius and large
   pores exceeding 100 Angstrom radius. A long dialysis cycle is associated
   with significant loss of HMWP only. Daily peritoneal protein losses, in
   mg (mean +/- SD), were as follows: beta(2)m 43.4 +/- 4.5; cyst C 9.6 +/-
   1.8; CCl6 1.8 +/- 0.3; REP 58.9 +/- 11.1; alpha(1)m 149.5 +/- 15.7; Alb
   6570 +/- 530; IgG 750 +/- 111; IgM 46.4 +/- 14.9; and alpha(2)m 67.0 +/-
   12.7. In conclusion, LMWP concentrations in the serum of patients on
   CAPD were markedly increased and influenced mainly by patient-related
   factors (residual diuresis and age). Serum albumin and REP declined with
   the duration of dialysis. Peritoneal protein loss was determined by the
   size of the protein and, for large proteins, by the dwell time. The
   peritoneum behaves as a membrane with at least two populations of pores.}},

   studies whether, or to what extent, observed put-call parity violations
   are due to market inefficiency or due to the value of early exercise. We
   avoid the early exercise problem by testing put-call parity using

Abstract = {{Studies were carried out to determine the predilection sites of
   Trichinella nativa muscle larvae in arctic foxes (Alopex lagopus) caught
   in Greenland. The highest number of larvae per gram of tissue was found
   in the muscles of the eyes and the legs. With regard to predilection
   sites no significant differences were demonstrated either between age
   groups or between foxes with high and low total parasite burdens.
   Predilection sites were comparable with those recorded earlier in
   experimentally infected caged foxes and in other carnivorous species.
   Hypotheses on predilection sites of Trichinella muscle larvae are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The experimental study of the energy-loss spectra of charged particles
   penetrating through various kinds of molecular films revealed a
   universal picture: a broad high peak in the energy region (h) over bar
   omega(r) similar or equal to 21-22 eV with the ratio Delta
   omega/omega(tau) similar or equal to 0.15. The laser induced excitations
   in small metal clusters (Na-n) manifested a broad peak in the energy
   region (h) over bar omega similar or equal to 2.5 eV for Na-n clusters
   and with a ratio of width to resonance energy Delta omega/omega(tau)
   similar or equal to 0.16. The absorption of gamma rays by nuclei is also
   characterized by a broad resonance peak in the 25-12 MeV region with a
   ratio Delta omega/omega(tau) similar or equal to 0.3-0.4 These
   experimental findings are attributed to the collective nature of the
   states excited in the energy-absorption process. We discuss the striking
   similarity in the nature of the collective states excited in atomic,
   molecular and nuclear systems, and also the differences in the possible
   channels of their decay.}},

Abstract = {{Plug-flow biofilm reactors were colonized by microorganisms indigenous

   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in streamwater. We performed experiments
   to determine the influence of physical, chemical, and biological factors

   months and the biological removal of DOC within the reactors was
   influenced by hydraulic residence time, dissolved organic carbon
   concentration, and water temperature. The large microbial biomass within
   a bioreactor buffered bioreactor performance from changes in chemical
   and physical parameters.}},
