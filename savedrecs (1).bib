Abstract = {{Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive tumour that grows
   in the pleural cavity. MPM spheroids released in the pleural fluid can
   form new tumour foci. Cell-cell, cell-extracellular matrix (ECM)
   interactions in 2D and 3D impact malignant cell behaviour during cell
   adhesion, migration, proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition
   (EMT). In this study, epithelioid, biphasic and sarcomatoid MPM cell
   types as well as benign mesothelial cells were tested with regards to
   the above phenotypes. Fibronectin (FN) and homologous cell-derived
   extracellular matrix (hcd-ECM) treated substratum differentially
   affected the above phenotypes. 3D MPM spheroid invasion was higher in
   FN-collagen matrices in the epithelioid and biphasic cells, while 3D
   cell cultures of epithelioid and sarcomatoid MPM cells in FN-collagen
   showed a higher contractility compared to hcd-ECM-collagen. Cell
   aggregates demonstrated invasive behaviour in hcd-ECM matrices alone.
   Our results suggest that ECM and the dimensionality affect malignant
   cell behaviour during cell culture studies.}},

Title = {{Social Security Uncertainty and Demand for Retirement Saving}},
Journal = {{REVIEW OF INCOME AND WEALTH}},
Abstract = {{The life-cycle model predicts an association between increased demand
   for retirement saving and the level of expected future social security
   benefits. The precautionary saving model shows that the risk associated
   to future benefits also matters. If social security benefits become more
   uncertain, individuals should react by increasing their demand for
   retirement saving. To assess the empirical relevance of this mechanism,
   we relate individual level measures of social security risk to demand
   for retirement saving vehicles. Using the Bank of Italy Survey of
   Household Income and Wealth, we find higher participation in private
   pension funds among individuals who expect lower and more uncertain
   social security benefits.}},

Abstract = {{Background The aim of this cross-sectional study to assess the
   proportions of anxiety and depression in patients with CuTS, and to
   explore the associated demographic and clinical features. Methods From
   May 2011 to January 2017, 246 patients diagnosed with CuTS were
   recruited. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to assess
   the proportions of depression and anxiety. Patient demographic and
   clinical data were collected. Univariate analysis and multivariate
   regression were carried out to identify the variables that were
   independently associated with anxiety and depression. Results The
   proportions of depression and anxiety were 17.9\% (n = 44) and 14.2\% (n
   = 35), respectively. Five patients had both possible/probable anxiety
   and depression. Logistic regression analysis revealed that diabetes
   mellitus was independently associated with depression; and the modified
   McGowan grade was independently associated with anxiety. Conclusions In
   patients with CuTS, the proportions of depression and anxiety were
   17.9\% and 14.2\%, respectively. Early screening for anxiety and
   depression is beneficial for patients with CuTS.}},

Abstract = {{Quantum clusters with target specificity are suitable for
   tissue-specific imaging. In the present work, amorphous zinc insulin
   quantum clusters (IZnQCs) had been synthesised to promote and monitor
   wound recovery. Easy synthesis, biocompatibility, stability, enhanced
   quantum yield, and solubility made the cluster suitable for
   preclinical/clinical exploration. Zn2+ is known for its binding to
   insulin hexamer. Here we report the reformation of the structure in a
   quantum cluster form in the presence of Zn2+. The formation of IZnQCs
   was confirmed by the change in zeta potential from -25.6 mV to -17.9 mV
   and also the formation of protein metal interaction was confirmed in
   FTIR bands at 450, 480, and 613 cm(-1) for Zn-O, Zn-N, and Zn-S,
   respectively. HRTEM-EDS and SAED data analysis showed an amorphous
   nature of the cluster. The binding of IZnQCs to the cells has been
   confirmed using confocal microscopy. IZnQCs showed a synergistic effect
   in wound recovery than insulin or Zn2+ alone. Further due to high
   fluorescence this recovery process can be monitored under an appropriate
   setup. Wound healing promotional activity, target specificity, and
   fluorescence properties make the IZnQCs ideal to use for bioimaging
   along with promoting and monitoring of wound recovery agent.}},

Abstract = {{Protection of isolated pancreatic islets against hypoxic and oxidative
   damage-induced apoptosis is essential during a pretransplantation
   culture period. A beneficial approach to maintain viable and functional
   islets is the coculture period with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).
   Hypoxia preconditioning of MSCs (Hpc-MSCs) for a short time stimulates
   the expression and secretion of antiapoptotic, antioxidant, and
   prosurvival factors. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the
   survival and function of human islets cocultured with Hpc-MSCs.
   Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs were subjected to hypoxia (5\% O-2: Hpc) or
   normoxia (20\% O-2: Nc) for 24 hours and then cocultured with isolated
   human islets in direct and indirect systems. Assays of viability and
   apoptosis, along with the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS),
   hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1 alpha), apoptotic pathway
   markers, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the islets,
   were performed. Insulin and C-peptide secretions as islet function were
   also evaluated. Hpc-MSCs and Nc-MSCs significantly reduced the ROS
   production and HIF-1 alpha protein aggregation, as well as
   downregulation of proapoptotic proteins and upregulation of
   antiapoptotic marker along with increment of VEGF secretion in the
   cocultured islet. However, the Hpc-MSCs groups were better than Nc-MSCs
   cocultured islets. Hpc-MSCs in both direct and indirect coculture
   systems improved the islet survival, while promotion of function was
   only significant in the direct cocultured cells. Hpc potentiated the
   cytoprotective and insulinotropic effects of MSCs on human islets
   through reducing stressful markers, inhibiting apoptosis pathway,
   enhancing prosurvival factors, and promoting insulin secretion,
   especially in direct coculture system, suggesting the effective strategy
   to ameliorate the islet quality for better transplantation outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{A scheme to quantify surface coverages of reactants at triple phase
   boundary (TPB) by electrochemical measurements was constructed to
   evaluate the electrode performance of solid oxide fuel cells and
   electrolysis cells (SOFC/EC). The developments of electrode requires
   that the intrinsic properties of materials separated from the effect of
   geometric structure of the electrode. The proposed reaction model at TPB
   of H-2/H2O electrodes is composed of competitive adsorptions and
   Langmure-type surface reactions under the relationship between oxygen
   activity (a(O)) and the electrode potential. To determine the reaction
   constant (k(a)) and four adsorption equilibrium constants at TPB (K-H,
   K-H2O, K-O and K-OH), a mashine learning approach with a genetic
   algorithm as an optimization method and the experimental data of
   reversible SOFC/ECs with different H-2/H2O partial pressures as the
   learning data was developed. As a result, even though all experimental
   curves of the current density vs. a(O) in SOFC operation were fitted by
   numerous sets of the five constants, the coverages under different
   conditions could be uniquely determined. Results suggest that TPB at 900
   degrees C was almost vacant with a small amount of H2O in SOEC
   operation, and was not vacant and the OH coverage increased with
   increasing a(O) in SOFC operation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we study the question of parallelization of a variant of
   Branch-and-Bound method for solving of the subset sum problem which is a
   special case of the Boolean knapsack problem. The following natural
   approach to the solution of this question is considered. At the first
   stage one of the processors (control processor) performs some number of
   algorithm steps of solving a given problem with generating some number
   of subproblems of the problem. In the second stage the generated
   subproblems are sent to other processors for solving (one subproblem per
   processor). Processors solve completely the received subproblems and
   return their solutions to the control processor which chooses the
   optimal solution of the initial problem from these solutions. For this
   approach we define formally a model of parallel computing (frontal
   parallelization scheme) and the notion of complexity of the frontal
   scheme. We study the asymptotic behavior of the complexity of the
   frontal scheme for two special cases of the subset sum problem.}},

Abstract = {{Chiral magnets possess topological line excitations where the
   magnetization within each cross section forms a skyrmion texture. We
   study analytically and numerically the low-energy, nonlinear dynamics of
   such a skyrmion string in a field-polarized cubic chiral magnet, and we
   demonstrate that it supports solitary waves. These waves are in general
   nonreciprocal, i.e., their properties depend on the sign of their
   velocity v, but this nonreciprocity diminishes with decreasing vertical
   bar v vertical bar. An effective field-theoretical description of the
   solitary waves is derived that is valid in the limit v -> 0 and gives
   access to their profiles and their existence regime. Our analytical
   results are quantitatively confirmed with micromagnetic simulations for
   parameters appropriate for the chiral magnet FeGe. Similarities with
   solitary waves found in vortex filaments of fluids are pointed out.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Elderly patients having a permanent pacemaker frequently
   have atrial remodeling. We examined the association between routine
   biomarkers and atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients receiving a
   dual-chamber pacemaker for sinus node disease (SND) or
   second-/third-degree atrioventricular block.
   Methods: We recorded clinical, laboratory, and electrocardiographic
   parameters as well as pacemaker lead parameters at implantation. The
   final analysis included 217 patients with SND and 393 patients with
   atrioventricular block. Notably, 102/217 (47\%) of the SND patients
   (median age: 77 years, 54\% men) and 54/393 (14\%) of the
   atrioventricular block patients (median age: 79 years, 54\% men) had AF
   history (paroxysmal or persistent).
   Results: Multivariable analysis showed that red blood cell distribution
   width (RDW) (OR: 1.17; 95\% CI: 1.05-1.36; P = .05) and serum
   gamma-glutamyl transferase (gamma GT) levels (OR: 1.15; 95\% CI:
   1.03-1.28; P = .04) were independently associated with AF history in
   patients with SND. In ROC curve analysis, the area under the curve (AUC)
   was 0.648; P < .01 for RDW, and 0.753; P < .01 for gamma GT. A RDW
   cut-off point of 14 was associated with AF with a sensitivity of 67\%
   and a specificity of 68\%, while a gamma GT cut-off point of 21 was
   associated with AF with a sensitivity of 80\% and a specificity of 65\%.
   In patients with second-/third-degree atrioventricular block, there were
   no significant independent correlations between AF and the parameters
   studied.
   Conclusions: In elderly patients with SND, RDW and gamma GT have an
   independent association with AF history. Our study failed to show any
   corresponding associations in patients with advanced disorders of
   atrioventricular conduction.}},

Pages = {{29-40}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This contribution takes reference to the question from a structural
   design point of view how rapid advances in 3D printing might be also
   transferred to the domain of structural connection design in buildings
   (metal construction) and which new opportunities may follow for the
   designing structural engineer. In this context, the approach of digital
   fabrication, design and calculations is proofing useful namely via a
   digital software parametric design, where 3D geometries can directly be
   processed by the 3D printing device - a seamless link from early design
   all the way to the work bench. Dependent on the project, also free-form
   structures might be programmed economically, because also screwing and
   other connecting parts to adjacent construction layers can directly be
   integrated, hence reducing fabrication steps. Currently only few built
   examples with 3D printed nodes are available, with some temporary ones
   described further below. In addition, initial axial tension and three-
   point- bending tests for synthetic probes without and with fiber
   reinforcement are presented, including their observed failure modes.
   From a metal construction point of view therefore a variety of open
   questions related to material strength, durability, long-term weather
   resistance and fire protection of such 3D printed nodes need to be
   researched further, such that suitable materials and reliable printing
   processes in the near future can also be officially approved by the
   building authorities to allow for broader industry applications.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To evaluate the effect of music in reducing pain during outpatient
   hysteroscopy under no anesthesia.
   Methods We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial From June
   2019 to December 2019 in Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital in
   Hong Kong. A total of 107 patients were randomized to music group (n =
   54) or non-music group (n = 53). Music was played during outpatient
   hysteroscopy in the music group. Patients in the non-music group had the
   procedure done in the same setting without music. Primary outcome was
   the level of pain measured using the visual analog scale (VAS) score
   before and during the procedure. Secondary outcomes were vital
   parameters that reflect the level of pain including blood pressure and
   heart rate.
   Results Patients in the music group experienced significantly less pain
   during outpatient hysteroscopy (VAS score 4.54 +/- 2.89 vs 5.88 +/-
   2.90; P = 0.02). The anticipated pain level was similar in both groups
   (VAS score 5.59 +/- 2.27 vs 6.11 +/- 2.43; P = 0.27). There was no
   statistically significant difference between the two groups in all the
   vital parameters.
   Conclusion Listening to music during outpatient hysteroscopy under no
   anesthesia significantly reduces pain in a well-matched Chinese
   population. Music is easy to provide with low-cost equipment and
   manpower. We recommend the routine use of music during outpatient
   hysteroscopy to improve patient care.}},

Abstract = {{As a result of bacterial infection with viruses, bacteria have developed
   CRISPR-Cas as an adaptive immune system, which allows them to destroy
   the viral genetic material introduced via infection. However, viruses
   have also evolved to develop multiple anti-CRISPR proteins, which are
   capable of inactivating the CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune system to combat
   bacteria. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms
   associated with anti-CRISPR proteins by determining a high-resolution
   crystal structure (1.3 angstrom) of Type I-E anti-CRISPR protein called
   AcrIE2. Our structural analysis revealed that AcrIE2 was composed of
   unique folds comprising five antiparallel beta-sheets (beta 1 similar to
   beta 5) surrounding one alpha-helix (alpha(1)) in the order,
   beta(2)beta(1)alpha(1)beta(5)beta(4)beta(3). Structural comparison of
   AcrIE2 with a structural homolog called AcrIF9 showed that AcrIE2
   contained a long and flexible beta 4-beta 5 connecting loop and a
   distinct surface feature. These results indicated that the inhibitory
   mechanism of AcrIE2 might be different from that of AcrIF9. This unique
   structure of AcrIE2 indicates its special mode of CRISPR-Cas inhibitory
   activity. Therefore, this study helps us understand the diversity in the
   inhibitory mechanisms of Acr family. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Curricular tracking is common in many countries, yet this school
   practice might have unintended consequences for students' attitudes
   toward school. We examined the changes in adolescents' school belonging
   among sixth graders placed in honors versus regular math, with academic
   identity as a mediator in this relation. Early adolescents (N = 322;
   72\% White; 164 girls) in the southeastern United States completed
   measures of school belonging and academic identity at the beginning and
   end of their sixth-grade year. With parent education, prior math
   achievement, and prior school belonging controlled, honors math
   placement predicted increases in school belonging from the beginning to
   the end of students' sixth-grade year, and this association was
   positively mediated by academic identity. Results of this study are
   important for further understanding the influences of tracking on
   students' motivational beliefs.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, we investigate the activity of defective graphene
   catalyze acetylene hydration reaction via density functional theory
   calculations at M062X/cc-pVDZ level. We calculated Fukui function in
   order to predict the adsorption sites and reaction sites. The adsorption
   ability of C2H2 and H2O on three kinds of defective graphene (single
   vacancy defective graphene {[}SVG], double vacancy defective graphene
   {[}DVG] and Stone-Wales defective graphene {[}SWDG]) were all enhanced
   compared with pure perfective graphene (PG), indicating the key role of
   defects. In addition, the adsorption strength of the two adsorbates
   decreased followed by the order of SVG > DVG > SWDG, and the strength of
   C2H2 is tougher than H2O adsorbed on SVG and DVG, while opposite in
   SWDG. We calculated Mayer bond order of the reaction process, which help
   us to confirm the bonding between the atoms in the reaction process and
   better understood the reaction mechanism. The rate-limiting step of all
   the three pathways possess was H2O dissociation. SVG possessed the
   lowest activation barrier of 40.44 kcal/mol, lower than DVG and SWDG.
   Thus, the significant catalytic contribution of graphene defects for
   acetylene hydration reaction should not be ignored. As a novel
   non-metallic catalyst, SVG may have research value in hydration of
   acetylene.}},

Title = {{A Study on the Mechanism of Impact between Curved Bridge Segments Using
   Nonsmooth Dynamics}},
Journal = {{SHOCK AND VIBRATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{It has been observed in many previous earthquakes that impact often
   occurs between the main girders in curved bridges. An earthquake can
   result in deck-unseating leading to catastrophic destruction of the
   structure. In this paper, the nonsmooth multirigid body dynamics method
   and the set-valued formulation were used to model and analyze the
   mechanism of impact between the curved bridge segments. The analysis
   demonstrated that these impacts are the major cause of segment rotation.
   The main contribution of this paper is to use Newton's impact law and
   Coulomb's friction law to describe the interaction between the curved
   bridge segments in the form of a set-valued function and to express
   impacts with friction as a linear complementary problem. For
   frictionless and frictional contact, the paper considers the
   single-point and multipoint impacts using the linear complementary
   formula to detect the unique actual slip-stick conditions of these
   states. A variety of criteria for distinguishing each case are presented
   and the results provide the kinetic characteristics of each contact
   case. The analysis has shown that the impact between the segments of a
   curved bridge and the tendency of the segments to rotate (and thus
   detach) are related to the overall geometry, the coefficient of
   restitution, the coefficient of friction, and the preimpact conditions
   in the plane of motion. Finally, a theoretical relationship diagram of
   the impact, rotation slip, and stick condition of the curved bridge
   segments at the contact point is given. The presented results will be
   useful for the seismic design of curved bridges.}},

Abstract = {{There is a need to clarify the coupling characteristics of
   terrain-induced wind fields and wind turbine-induced wake in wind farm
   micrositing. However, research investigating the effect of hill shape on
   this interaction is lacking. In addition, during the optimization of the
   layout of the turbines over topographies, the flow behind the turbines
   should be predicted in a fast way. After obtaining the wake flow of the
   turbine mounted on flat terrain and the flow over the topographies,
   there are mainly two superposition methods to predict the turbine wake
   flow over the topographies. One is to add the wind deficit following the
   location with a vertical distance of the hub height (D-line). The other
   is to add the wind deficit following the streamline starting from the
   turbine center (B-line). It remains unknown to what extent these two
   superposition methods can be adopted. Therefore, the effects of hill
   shape, wind turbine size, and turbine location are investigated. When
   the wind deficit, obtained from modeling the wake flow of the turbine
   mounted on flat terrain, is superposed following B-line, the results are
   overall better than those when following D-line.}},

Abstract = {{Molybdenum (Mo) in marine sediments has been used as a paleoproxy to
   provide evidence for past oceanic euxinic and sulfidic conditions
   through its association with pyrite. Here, we examine the adsorption of
   Mo to the pyrite precursors mackinawite and greigite and assess the
   robustness of this association during iron sulfide phase
   transformations. Tetrathiomolybdate (MoS42-) adsorption experiments were
   done using mackinawite and greigite that had been characterized using
   powder X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Adsorption of
   tetrathiomolybdate to mackinawite and to a primarily greigite mixture
   was similar. Both showed little change to the mineral phase upon
   adsorption. Relative to previously published data on pyrite, there was a
   much greater amount of Mo adsorption and a different mode of adsorption.
   A mackinawite/greigite mixture was also synthesized through an
   alternative method that more closely mimicked environmental conditions
   with a brief in situ aging to form an initial phase of iron sulfide,
   likely highly disordered mackinawite, and the near-immediate addition of
   MoS42-. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results support the adsorption
   of tetrathiomolybdate and its concomitant reduction to Mo(IV). The
   Mo-adsorbed mackinawite/greigite mixture was transformed through heating
   into a greigite/pyrite mixture while monitoring Mo release to the
   aqueous phase. Here, the sorption of Mo on the solid phase promoted the
   transformation of mackinawite into pyrite upon heating without
   diagenetic loss of Mo to the aqueous phase. These results support the
   early capture of MoS42- to less-stable forms of iron sulfide with
   negligible diagenetic loss during subsequent transformation. This work
   continues to point to Mo(VI) as a plausible oxidant of FeS to FeS2
   within natural euxinic settings.}},

Abstract = {{An assessment of mood or emotion is important in developing mental
   health measures, and facial expressions are strongly related to mood or
   emotion. This study thus aimed to examine the relationship between
   levels of negative mood and characteristics of mouth parts when moods
   are drawn as facial expressions on a common platform. A cross-sectional
   study of Japanese college freshmen was conducted, and 1,068 valid
   responses were analyzed. The questionnaire survey consisted of
   participants' characteristics, the Profile of Mood States (POMS), and a
   sheet of facial expression drawing (FACED), and the sheet was digitized
   and analyzed using an image-analysis software. Based on the total POMS
   score as an index of negative mood, the participants were divided into
   four groups: low (L), normal (N), high (H), and very high (VH). Lengths
   of drawn lines and between both mouth corners were significantly longer,
   and circularity and roundness were significantly higher in the L group.
   With increasing levels of negative mood, significant decreasing trends
   were observed in these lengths. Convex downward and enclosed figures
   were significantly predominant in the L group, while convex upward
   figures were significantly predominant and a tendency toward
   predominance of no drawn mouths or line figures was found in the H and
   VH groups. Our results suggest that mood states can be significantly
   related to the size and figure characteristics of drawn mouths of FACED
   on a non-verbal common platform. That is, these findings mean that
   subjects with low negative mood may draw a greater and rounder mouth and
   figures that may be enclosed and downward convex, while subjects with a
   high negative mood may not draw the line, or if any, may draw the line
   shorter and upward convex.}},

Abstract = {{With the rise of opioid deaths and methadone maintenance treatment (MMT)
   being the ``gold standard,{''} evidence lacks the quality of life for
   those on Methadone.
   Objective This study aimed to develop educational materials for
   communities and clinics about MMT and abstinence, utilizing the
   PhotoVoice technique to represent the voice of those on Methadone
   treatment (MMT) and abstinence for recovery from opioid use disorder
   (OUD). Participants shared firsthand experiences of life on Methadone
   and abstinence, resulting in a short video clip and a poster.
   Design Participants were recruited following meetings of Alcoholics
   Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous. An introduction letter was handed
   out, and questions were answered. After COVID-19 Pandemic, further
   communications were delivered through Email. Five participants on
   Methadone and four who were abstinent were recruited. Participants were
   18 years and over, male and female, were on MMT or abstinent for 6
   months or more.
   Results Common themes among participants were extracted and discussed

Title = {{Maternal diabetes and risk of multiple sclerosis in the offspring: A
   Danish nationwide register-based cohort study}},
Journal = {{MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS JOURNAL}},
Abstract = {{Background:
   Previous studies suggest a 3- to-10-fold increased risk of multiple
   sclerosis (MS) in offspring of mothers with diabetes mellitus (DM).
   Objectives:
   To examine MS risk in offspring of diabetic mothers, overall and
   according to type of maternal DM, that is, pregestational DM or
   gestational DM, as well as to examine MS risk among offspring of
   diabetic fathers.
   Methods:
   The study cohort included all 1,633,436 singletons born in Denmark
   between 1978 and 2008. MS diagnoses were identified in the Danish
   Multiple Sclerosis Registry, and parental DM diagnoses in the National
   Patient Register. We used Cox proportional hazards regression analyses
   to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs)
   for the association of parental DM with MS risk in the offspring.
   Results:
   MS risk among individuals whose mothers had pregestational DM was
   2.3-fold increased compared with that among individuals with nondiabetic
   mothers (HR = 2.25; 95\% CI: 1.35-3.75, n = 15). MS risk was
   statistically non-significant among offspring of mothers with
   gestational DM (HR = 1.03 (95\% CI: 0.49-2.16), n = 7) and among
   offspring of diabetic fathers (HR = 1.40 (95\% CI: 0.78-2.54), n = 11).
   Conclusion:
   Our nationwide cohort study utilizing high-quality register data in
   Denmark over several decades corroborates the view that offspring of
   diabetic mothers may be at an elevated risk of developing MS.}},

Abstract = {{Findings from previous psychotherapy research suggest that the majority
   of improvement takes place in the initial phase of treatment with the
   relative effectiveness dropping at a negatively accelerating rate.
   However, the evidence for this pattern of change comes from
   investigations of short-term treatments and it is unclear whether this
   also holds for more flexible and long-term psychotherapy. We provided
   open-ended treatments under routine-care conditions for a representative
   sample of 362 patients, including a large proportion characterized by
   severe psychopathology. Patients attended 52 sessions on average (SD =
   59, range = 1-364, Mdn = 36). Our results indicated that the degree of
   improvement was linearly associated with time spent in psychotherapy and
   contingent upon the severity of psychological problems at intake. The
   least severely afflicted received the shortest treatments, experienced
   the most rapid change but demonstrated smaller overall magnitudes of
   improvement. More severely suffering patients received longer
   treatments, had slower rates of change but in general received greater
   overall benefits. We argue that previous suggestions of psychotherapy
   dosage have been less appropriate for patients suffering from moderate
   to severe psychopathology.}},

Abstract = {{The existence of nonlinearity in a spintronic device is indispensable
   for spin-based complex signal-processing operations. Here we measure the
   presence of electron-spin-dependent nonlinearity in a van der Waals
   heterostructure spintronic device. We further demonstrate its
   application for basic analog operations such as essential elements of
   amplitude modulation and frequency sum (heterodyne detection) on pure
   spin signals, by exploiting the second-harmonic generation of the spin
   signal due to nonlinear spin injection. Furthermore, we show that the
   presence of nonlinearity in the spin signal has an amplifying effect on
   the energy-dependent conductivity-induced nonlinear spin-to-charge
   conversion effect. The interaction of the two spin-dependent nonlinear
   effects in the spin-transport channel leads to a highly efficient
   modulation of the spin-to-charge conversion effect, which in principle
   can also be measured without using a ferromagnetic detector. These
   effects are measured both at room and low temperatures, and are suitable
   for their applications as nonlinear circuit elements in the fields of
   advanced spintronics and spin-based neuromorphic computing.}},

Abstract = {{Anti-D is the most common cause of hemolytic disease of the newborn
   (HDN) in the developing countries even after the introduction of anti-D
   immunoprophylaxis. Still, ABO incompatibility and other alloantibodies
   against minor blood group antigens have emerged as significant causes of
   HDN. Moreover, ABO incompatibility acts as a protective barrier to the
   expression of Rh isoimmunization. Here we are presenting a case of HDN
   where both Rh and ABO incompatibility co-existed with their
   manifestations in a B positive neonate born to an O positive mother. Use
   of appropriate elution technique can aid in the diagnosis of such cases.
   Hence, antenatal screening of all mothers irrespective of their Rh D
   status can help in early diagnosis and proper management that can
   decrease the neonatal morbidity and mortality.}},

Abstract = {{A new composite from graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and NiFe layered

   nanocomposite displays a specific capacitance of 712.7 F g(-1) and
   excellent cycle life after 2500 cycles by applying 10 A g(-1) of the
   current density in 1 M KOH electrolyte, which confirms that the
   nanocomposite has superb capacitance retention (similar to 94.8 \%) and

Abstract = {{GaAs/AlGaAs semiconductor nanoheterostructures have found attractive
   application in the field of biosensing based on the effect of digital
   photocorrosion (DIP). The sensitivity of
   semiconductor-nanoheterostructure-based biosensors depends on the
   precision of controlling the process of DIP, which is highly sensitive
   to the surface presence of electrically charged biomolecules. To explore
   further this process, we have investigated the role of a galvanic
   displacement (GD) reaction on DIP of GaAs/Al0.35Ga0.65As (001)
   nanoheterostructures. Deposition of ionic gold on the GaAs surface
   induces spontaneous electron transfer between the semiconductor and
   ionic gold, which affects the photocorrosion of GaAs/AlGaAs layers
   observed simultaneously with the photoluminescence effect. The immediate
   consequence of the electron transfer from GaAs toward Au3+ is a
   significantly increased rate of DIP. At the same time, the formation of
   neutralized gold nanoparticles and Au-Ga alloy takes place on the
   surface of photocorroding nanoheterostructures. In the presence of 2.8\%
   solution of ammonia and 0.1 mM gold chloride, a significantly reduced
   rate of deposition of gold nanoparticles is observed. This allows
   achieving layer-by-layer removal of the investigated material, which is
   sensitive to perturbations induced by surface immobilized electrically
   charged molecules. We have elaborated various factors stimulating
   photocorrosion of the GaAs/Al0.35Ga0.65As nanoheterostructures and we
   demonstrate the biosensing potential of an innovative GD-based DIP
   sensor.}},

Abstract = {{Rice is a particularly widely consumed food crop globally, but its yield
   is seriously damaged by bacterial blight due to Xanthomonas oryzae pv.
   oryzae (Xoo) and bakanae disease due to Fusarium fujikuroi (F.
   fujikuroi). However, broad-spectrum resistance (BSR) to both Xoo and F.
   fujikuroi remains largely elusive. In this study, we showed that rice
   monothiol glutaredoxin GRXS15 localizes in mitochondria and the nucleus,
   and its transcription is induced by Xoo. Transgenic rice lines
   constitutively expressing OsGRXS15 showed enhanced disease resistance to
   Xoo and F. fujikuroi, while CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout mutants showed
   reduced resistance compared with the wild-type plants. The transcription
   of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes was significantly induced in
   OsGRXS15-expressing plants. The rice transcription factor OsWRKY65 was
   identified as a binding partner, and it directly interacted with
   OsGRXS15 in the nucleus. Moreover, we revealed that the interaction of
   OsGRXS15 and OsWRKY65 results in the upregulation of OsPR1. These
   results suggested that OsGRXS15 interacts with transcription factors,

Title = {{The effect of income, family and socio-religious affiliations on
   self-rated health of the aged in India}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS}},
Abstract = {{This research sought to examine whether economic dependence, immediate
   family characteristics and socio-religious affiliation predict the
   health status of the elderly in India. Towards this objective,
   Government of India's unit-level Round 71 NSSO data containing responses
   from more than 27,245 persons aged above 60 were employed. We used
   ordered logistic regression owing to the categorical and ordinal nature
   of the output variable. Our findings suggest a direct relationship
   between income and healthy ageing. Conversely, financial dependence
   negatively affects health status. With respect to immediate family
   characteristics, loss of spouse negatively influences health status,
   while presence of children and presence of at least a son (as opposed to
   none) positively influence the health status of the Indian elderly.
   While the increment in the number of sons has no effect, an increase in
   the number of daughters has a negative influence on elderly health
   status. Finally, our findings in regards to socio-religious affiliations
   suggest that Buddhist elderly report positive and Muslim elderly report
   negative health status, in comparison with other religions. Furthermore,
   elderly persons classified as scheduled tribes report positive and those
   classified as scheduled castes report negative health status, as
   compared to other social groups. Policy and research implications are
   discussed. Limitations are acknowledged.}},

Title = {{Salmonella Effector SpvB Disrupts Intestinal Epithelial Barrier
   Integrity for Bacterial Translocation}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR AND INFECTION MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{Salmonella are common enteric bacterial pathogens that infect both
   humans and animals. Intestinal epithelial barrier, formed by a single
   layer of epithelial cells and apical junctional complex (AJC), plays a
   crucial role in host defense against enteric pathogens to prevent
   bacterial translocation. However, the underlying mechanisms of
   intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction caused by Salmonella are
   poorly understood. It is found that a locus termed Salmonella plasmid
   virulence (spv) gene exists extensively in clinically important
   Salmonella serovars. SpvB is a key effector encoded within this locus,
   and closely related to Salmonella pathogenicity such as interfering with
   autophagy and iron homeostasis. To investigate the interaction between
   SpvB and intestinal epithelial barrier and elucidate the underlying
   molecular mechanism, we used the typical foodborne disease agent
   Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Salmonella typhimurium)
   carrying spvB or not to construct infection models in vivo and in vitro.
   C57BL/6 mice were orally challenged with S. typhimurium wild-type strain
   SL1344 or spvB-deficient mutant strain SL1344-Delta spvB. Caco-2 cell
   monolayer model, as a widely used model to mimic the human intestinal
   epithelium in vitro, was infected with SL1344, SL1344-Delta spvB, or
   spvB complementary strain SL1344-c-Delta spvB, respectively. The results
   showed that SpvB enhanced bacterial pathogenicity during S. typhimurium
   infection in vivo, and contributed to intestinal epithelial barrier
   dysfunction in both infection systems. This SpvB-mediated barrier
   dysfunction was attributed to the cellular redistribution of Claudin-1,
   Occludin, and E-cadherin junctional proteins. Moreover, by using
   pharmacological inhibitors, we found that F-actin rearrangement and
   suppression of protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathway were involved in
   SpvB-mediated barrier dysfunction. In conclusion, the study reveals the
   contribution of Salmonella effector SpvB to the dysfunction of
   intestinal epithelial barrier integrity, which facilitates bacterial
   translocation via the paracellular route to promote Salmonella systemic
   dissemination. Our findings broaden the understanding of host-pathogen
   interactions in salmonellosis, and provide new strategies for the
   therapy in limiting bacterial dissemination during infection.}},

Abstract = {{Benthic diatoms are often included in bioassessment programs of river
   health as sensitive indicators of nutrient status and pollution. Many
   diatom-based indices have been developed and are frequently used to
   infer conditions in water quality. However, concerns have been raised
   regarding the robustness of these indices in riverine systems that have
   natural variability in environmental conditions, including seasonal
   change of water quality parameters, especially in terms of physical and
   chemical characteristics of water, which also influence diatom community
   composition. Here, we used three diatom-based indices (Diatom-based
   eutrophication/pollution index, EPI-D; Biological Diatom Index, IBD;
   Watanabe's Index, WAT), which have previously been validated as robust
   for water quality assessment in China, to explore their response to
   temporal changes in water quality and diatom community structure in a
   riverine network over time. Concentrations of total nitrogen (TN),
   nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), total phosphorus (TP), temperature (t), and
   turbidity in April 2010 were significantly higher than in November 2007.
   The 141 diatom taxa we found in April 2010 were fewer than the 194 taxa
   we found in November 2007. On both occasions, the three diatom indices
   responded to same water quality variables (phosphorus and chloride or
   nitrogen) as reported in previous studies. Of the three diatom indices
   tested, EPI-D provided the most robust measure of natural seasonal
   changes in water quality and indicated the phosphorus and chloride. Our
   study confirms that these three diatom indices are effective for
   evaluating long-term water quality in large rivers.}},

Abstract = {{The readout of a microwave qubit state occurs using an amplification
   chain that enlarges the quantum state to a signal detectable with a
   classical measurement apparatus. However, at what point in this process
   is the quantum state really ``measured{''}? To investigate whether the
   ``measurement{''} takes place in the amplification chain, in which a
   parametric amplifier is often chosen as the first amplifier, it is
   proposed to construct a microwave interferometer that has such an
   amplifier added to each of its arms. Feeding the interferometer with
   single photons, the interference visibility depends on the gain of the
   amplifiers and whether a measurement collapse has taken place during the
   amplification process. The visibility as given by standard quantum
   mechanics is calculated as a function of gain, insertion loss, and
   temperature. A visibility of 1/3 is found in the limit of large gain
   without considering losses, which is reduced to 0.26 in case the
   insertion loss of the amplifiers is 2.2 dB at a temperature of 50 mK. It
   is shown that if the wave function collapses within the interferometer,
   the measured visibility is reduced compared with its magnitude predicted
   by standard quantum mechanics once this collapse process sets in.}},

   process model to understand the complex dynamics among technology,
   society, and the environment via seven interactive elements:
   technologies, actors, receiving bodies, natural contexts, social
   contexts, temporal-spatial contexts, and outcomes. The model was applied
   to agricultural and water technology development in China from 8000 bc
   to 1911 ad. Our findings show that these elements did not play equally
   important roles in different periods of the development in ancient
   China, with social contexts most dominating during the earlier periods
   and both social and environmental concerns arising towards the later
   periods. The proposed model, by identifying the elements in the
   technology development that should be strengthened, can act as an
   analysis device to assist in reconfiguring a more sustainable
   socio-technological system.}},

   Pembrolizumab: A Case Report}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{Chordoma is a rare primary bone tumor that exhibits insensitivity to
   radiotherapy and chemotherapy and has a poor prognosis. Currently,
   resection is the primary treatment for affected patients, but the
   subsequent rate of recurrence is high, and both overall survival (OS)
   and progression-free survival (PFS) are consequentially relatively
   short. This case report describes a patient who was diagnosed with
   metastatic chordoma that was found to possess the A1209fs mutation of
   the PBRM1 gene, which may be associated with beneficial responses to
   immunotherapies. The patient received pembrolizumab, an immune
   checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) that targets the PD-1 receptor of
   lymphocytes, as second-line therapy, which he tolerated well (the most
   frequent adverse events were abnormal liver function and hyperglycemia,
   both of which were only grades 1-2), and achieved a PFS duration of 9.3
   months. We hope these results will promote further research that will
   clarify the mechanisms underlying this beneficial response and that will
   further explore the use of immunotherapies in this population.}},

Title = {{Half-minute-scale atomic coherence and high relative stability in a

Abstract = {{The preparation of large, low-entropy, highly coherent ensembles of
   identical quantum systems is fundamental for many studies in quantum
   metrology(1), simulation(2) and information(3). However, the
   simultaneous realization of these properties remains a central challenge
   in quantum science across atomic and condensed-matter systems(2,4-7).
   Here we leverage the favourable properties of tweezer-trapped
   alkaline-earth (strontium-88) atoms(8-10), and introduce a hybrid
   approach to tailoring optical potentials that balances scalability,
   high-fidelity state preparation, site-resolved readout and preservation
   of atomic coherence. With this approach, we achieve trapping and
   optical-clock excited-state lifetimes exceeding 40 seconds in ensembles
   of approximately 150 atoms. This leads to half-minute-scale atomic
   coherence on an optical-clock transition, corresponding to quality
   factors well in excess of 10(16). These coherence times and atom numbers
   reduce the effect of quantum projection noise to a level that is
   comparable with that of leading atomic systems, which use optical
   lattices to interrogate many thousands of atoms in parallel(11,12). The
   result is a relative fractional frequency stability of 5.2(3) x
   10(-17)tau(-1/2) (where tau is the averaging time in seconds) for
   synchronous clock comparisons between sub-ensembles within the tweezer
   array. When further combined with the microscopic control and readout
   that are available in this system, these results pave the way towards
   long-lived engineered entanglement on an optical-clock transition(13) in
   tailored atom arrays.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The whole world was hit hard by the coronavirus disease-19
   (COVID-19). Given that angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the
   viral entry molecule, understanding ACE2 has become a major focus of
   current COVID-19 research. ACE2 is highly expressed in the gut, but its
   role has not been fully understood and thus COVID-19 treatments
   intending to downregulate ACE2 level may cause untoward side effects.
   Gaining insight into the functions of ACE2 in gut homeostasis therefore
   merits closer examination, and is beneficial to find potential
   therapeutic alternatives for COVID-19. Methods: We took advantage of
   Ace2 knockout out mice and isolated intestinal organoids to examine the
   role of ACE2 in intestinal stemness. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
   mouse model was established by 4\% dextran sodium sulfate. LGR5 and KI67
   levels were quantitated to reflect the virtue of intestinal stem cells
   (ISCs). FITC-dextran 4 (FD-4) assay was used to assess intestinal
   barrier function. Results: Western blotting identified the expression of
   ACE2 in colon, which was consistent with the results of
   immunofluorescence and RT-PCR. Moreover, Ace2(-/-) organoids showed
   decreased LRG5 and KI67 levels, and elevated calcium concentration.
   Furthermore, the permeability of ace2(-/-) organoids was markedly
   increased compared with ace2(+/+) organoids. Collectively, ace2(-/-)
   mice were more susceptible than ace2(+/+) mice to IBD, including earlier
   bloody stool, undermined intestinal architecture and more pronounced
   weight loss. Conclusions: Our data reveal that ACE2 contributes to the
   proliferation of intestinal stem cells and hence orchestrates the
   mucosal homeostasis. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Private Set Intersection Cardinality (PSI-CA) and Private Set Union
   Cardinality (PSU-CA) are two cryptographic primitives whereby two or

   sets is preserved. In this paper, we propose a three-party protocol to
   finish these tasks by using quantum resources, where every two, as well
   as three, parties can obtain the cardinalities of the intersection and
   the union of their private sets with the help of a semi-honest third
   party (TP). In our protocol, GHZ states play a role in encoding private
   information that will be used by TP to compute the cardinalities. We
   show that the presented protocol is secure against well-known quantum
   attacks. In addition, we analyze the influence of six typical kinds of
   Markovian noise on our protocol.}},

Abstract = {{The nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing family
   pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is involved in various
   acute and chronic liver diseases, however, it is not clear whether NLRP3
   contributes to D-Galactosamine (D-GalN) plus lipopolysaccharide
   (LPS)-induced acute liver failure (ALF). This study aims to investigate
   the role of NLRP3 inflammasome in D-GalN/LPS-induced fatal hepatitis. We
   found that Nlrp3(-/-) and WT mice showed similar mortality against a
   lethal dose of D-GalN/LPS treatment. Serum ALT and AST levels, as well
   as liver necrosis area and hepatocyte apoptosis, were not significantly
   different between Nlrp3(-/-) and WT mice at 6 h after D-GalN/LPS
   injection. Moreover, the numbers of intrahepatic F4/80(+) cells and
   Ly6G(+) cells were comparable in two genotype mice following D-GalN/LPS
   treatment. Besides, Nlrp3(-/-) mice had reduced IL-1 beta levels but
   similar TNF-alpha, IL-6, and MCP-1 levels compared with WT mice upon
   D-GalN/LPS administration. Our findings revealed that NLRP3 ablation
   does not protect mice from D-GalN/LPS-induced fatal hepatitis and has a
   marginal effect on intrahepatic inflammatory response upon D-GalN/LPS
   treatment. This suggests that NLRP3 inflammasome does not appear to be a
   major contributor to D-GalN/LPS-induced ALF. (C) 2020 Published by

Abstract = {{Background: Neuropathic pain (NPP) is a common clinical symptom, its
   pathological mechanism is complex, and there is currently no good
   treatment method. Therefore, exploring the treatment method of NPP is a
   critical issue that needs to be urgently solved.
   Methods: Neural stem cells (NSC) and microencapsulated neural stem cells
   (MC-NSC) were transplanted into the site of sciatic nerve injury, and
   behavioral methods were used to detect changes in pain. Expression
   levels of P2X7R were detected in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) by
   molecular biological methods.
   Results: After sciatic nerve injury, mechanical withdrawal thresholds
   (MWT) and thermal withdrawal latency (TWL) of rats were significantly
   reduced, the expression levels of P2X7R in the DRG were significantly
   increased. After transplantation of NSC and MC-NSC, it was found that
   expression levels of P2X7R were significantly reduced and pain was
   significantly suppressed. Importantly, compared with NSC
   transplantation, MC-NSC could better reduce the expression levels of
   P2X7R and inhibit pain.
   Conclusion: MC-NSC can better decrease the expression levels of P2X7R
   and relieve NPP. Our results provide a novel method and data support for
   the treatment of NPP. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{10298-10305}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{One may expect that isotopic exchange has no influence on charge carrier
   lifetime and perovskite solar cell performance because isotopic effects
   do not affect the fundamental electronic structure of materials.
   Experiments defy this expectation. By performing nonadiabatic (NA)
   molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that hydrogen and
   deuterium exchange significantly enhances the excited-state lifetime and
   stability of CH3NH3PbI3. Replacing lighter hydrogen with heavier
   deuterium suppresses the collective motions of organic and inorganic
   components, thus enhancing lattice stiffness and decreasing the NA
   coupling. Isotopic exchange further reduces NA coupling by localizing
   electron wave functions for separation of electrons and holes, which
   beats the extended coherence time, slowing down nonradiative
   electron-hole recombination from CH3ND3PbI3 to CD3ND3PbI3 with respect
   to the pristine system. The unchanged fundamental electronic structure
   together with the prolonged carrier lifetime and enhanced stability
   rationalize the improvement of the deuterated CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells.
   Our work provides valuable insights into isotope effects for the design
   of high-performance perovskite photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{Background: In high-risk patients with cervical incompetence,
   laparoscopic cerclage is a promising treatment option. However, the
   procedure exhibits relevant surgical risks. Aims: The purpose of this
   study was to evaluate a surgical ``needle-free{''} technique for
   minimally invasive, laparoscopically placed cervico-isthmic cerclage in
   high-risk patients. Methods: This was a retrospective observational
   study over a 10-year period of pre- and postconceptional cerclage
   placement. The included patients either experienced previous
   transvaginal cerclage (TVC) failure or were not eligible for TVC.
   Laparoscopic transabdominal cerclage using a needle-less mersilene tape
   was performed via a broad ligament window lateral to the uterine
   vessels. Results: Laparoscopic transabdominal cerclage was successfully
   performed in all included women with a median operation time of 62 min.
   We did not observe any intra- or postoperative complications,
   particularly no bleeding complications. Nine of 11 women became pregnant
   and/or carried out a successful pregnancy, respectively. Importantly, we
   did not observe any cases of miscarriage or mid-trimester loss. Two
   patients did not conceive; however, their medical histories did include
   Asherman's syndrome and advanced maternal age. Conclusion:
   Transabdominal laparoscopic ``needle-free{''} cerclage is a safe and
   effective treatment option for a well-selected group of women at high
   risk of cervical incompetence. It provides good obstetric results
   without increasing perioperative morbidity.}},

   has been optimised by a design of experiment using Box and Behnken model
   with three variables such as concentration of TiO2 nanoparticles,
   padding time and curing temperature at three levels. The ultraviolet
   protection factor, tensile strength, air permeability, bending length,
   water absorbency and surface morphology of finished fabrics were
   evaluated; followed by regression analysis for optimisation in
   statistical software Design Expert 8.1. The optimum condition for UV
   protection finishing on silk/lyocell blended fabric was 5.85\% TiO2, 35

Title = {{Preoperative platelet distribution width-to-platelet count ratio as a
   prognostic factor in patients with glioblastoma multiforme}},
Journal = {{BRITISH JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY}},
Abstract = {{Backgrounds
   The prognostic significance of the platelet volume indices (PVIs),
   including the platelet distribution width (PDW), mean platelet volume
   (MPV), and platelet distribution width-to-platelet count ratio (PDW/P)
   has been demonstrated in a variety of malignancies. This study aimed to
   evaluate the prognostic value of PVIs in patients with a newly diagnosed
   glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).
   Methods
   We retrospectively evaluated the clinical data of 143 patients with GBM
   who managed at our center between May 2010 and May 2019. Receiver
   operating characteristic curves (ROC) for cutoff value determination,
   Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and univariate and multivariate Cox
   regression analyses were performed.
   Results
   The corresponding cutoff values for MPV, PDW, and PDW/P were 9.05, 14.7,
   and 0.51, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier survival analyses showed that
   patients with an MPV < 9.05 and those with PDW p < 0.51 had a longer
   overall survival (OS) (p < 0.05). Based on univariate analysis, age,
   Karnofsky Performance Status scores (KPS), tumor focality, MPV, PDW, and
   PDW/P were predictors of OS (p < 0.05). Final multivariate Cox
   regression analyses showed age (HR 1.040, 95\% CI 1.009-1.071, P,0.011),
   KPS (HR 2.208, 95\% CI 1.107-4.405, P,0.025), tumor focality (HR 4.596,
   95\% CI 1.988-10.626, p < 0.001), and PDW/P (HR 1.786, 95\% CI
   1.103-3.072, P,0.037) as the independent predictors of OS in patients
   with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.

Abstract = {{Background Suboptimal feeding practices have a negative impact on
   children's health and growth in the first 2 years of life and increase
   their risk of undernutrition, morbidity, and mortality. The aim of the
   study was to assess the factors that influence infant and young child
   feeding practices among urban mothers in a hospital setting at Karachi,
   Pakistan. Methods A longitudinal multi-center cohort study was conducted
   in four countries, MULTICENTER BODY COMPOSITION REFERENCE STUDY (MBCRS)
   to produce normal body composition reference data in healthy infants
   from 3 months to 24 months of age. Repeated anthropometric (weight,
   length and head circumference) and body composition measurements using
   ``deuterium dilution method{''} along with 24-h dietary recall
   questionnaires were performed on 250 healthy term infants at 3, 6, 9,
   12, 18, and 24 months of age. The 24-h dietary recall data from this
   study was used to assess the breastfeeding and complementary feeding
   practices in children aged 6-24 months. Results A total of 250 healthy
   infants were enrolled in the study. A majority of newborns (75.4\%) were
   exclusively breastfed till 3 months of age; however, by 6 months of age,
   only 30.2\% of infants were exclusively breastfed. Only 44.1\% of
   children aged 6-24 months achieved minimum dietary diversity (MDD),
   84.7\% achieved minimum meal frequency (MMF), and 44.1\% achieved a
   minimum acceptable diet (MAD). 71.4\% achieved MDD and MAD and 100\%
   achieved MMF at 24 months. The bivariate analysis found that breastfed
   children (OR 3.93, 95\% CI 2.72-5.68), with employed mothers (OR 1.55,
   95\% CI 1.06-2.27) who had graduated from secondary school (OR 1.45,
   95\% CI 1.08-1.94) were more likely to meet minimum dietary diversity.
   The multivariable analysis showed that only the child's age was
   significantly associated with MDD (p value< 0.0001), with the likelihood
   of meeting MDD increasing as the children aged; 9 months (OR 18.96, 95\%
   CI 6.63-54.19), 12 months (OR 40.25, 95\% CI 14.14-114.58), 18 months
   (OR 90.02, 95\% CI 30.84-262.77) and 24 months (OR 82.14, 95\% CI
   27.23-247.83). Conclusion Our study revealed that Infant and young child
   feeding practices are significantly associated with maternal education,
   employment, and the child's age. Therefore, it is essential that
   investments be made towards protective breastfeeding and complementary
   feeding policies and legislations, emphasis on female education and
   ensuring the availability of affordable nutritious and diverse foods.}},

Title = {{Anti-tumour immunity induces aberrant peptide presentation in melanoma}},
Journal = {{NATURE}},
Abstract = {{Tryptophan depletion in melanoma cells after prolonged treatment with
   interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) results in ribosomal frameshifting and the
   production of aberrant peptides that can be presented to T cells and
   induce an immune response.
   Extensive tumour inflammation, which is reflected by high levels of
   infiltrating T cells and interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) signalling,
   improves the response of patients with melanoma to checkpoint
   immunotherapy(1,2). Many tumours, however, escape by activating cellular
   pathways that lead to immunosuppression. One such mechanism is the
   production of tryptophan metabolites along the kynurenine pathway by the
   enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), which is induced by IFN
   gamma(3-5). However, clinical trials using inhibition of IDO1 in
   combination with blockade of the PD1 pathway in patients with melanoma
   did not improve the efficacy of treatment compared to PD1 pathway
   blockade alone(6,7), pointing to an incomplete understanding of the role
   of IDO1 and the consequent degradation of tryptophan in mRNA translation
   and cancer progression. Here we used ribosome profiling in melanoma
   cells to investigate the effects of prolonged IFN gamma treatment on
   mRNA translation. Notably, we observed accumulations of ribosomes
   downstream of tryptophan codons, along with their expected stalling at
   the tryptophan codon. This suggested that ribosomes bypass tryptophan
   codons in the absence of tryptophan. A detailed examination of these
   tryptophan-associated accumulations of ribosomes-which we term
   `W-bumps'-showed that they were characterized by ribosomal frameshifting
   events. Consistently, reporter assays combined with proteomic and
   immunopeptidomic analyses demonstrated the induction of ribosomal
   frameshifting, and the generation and presentation of aberrant
   trans-frame peptides at the cell surface after treatment with IFN gamma.
   Priming of naive T cells from healthy donors with aberrant peptides
   induced peptide-specific T cells. Together, our results suggest that
   IDO1-mediated depletion of tryptophan, which is induced by IFN gamma,
   has a role in the immune recognition of melanoma cells by contributing
   to diversification of the peptidome landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Pollen viability is crucial for wheat breeding programs. The unique
   potential of the protoplasm of live cells to turn brown due to the
   synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) through rapid photoreduction
   of Ag+, was exploited for testing wheat pollen viability. Ag+-viability
   test medium (consisting of 0.5 mM AgNO3 and 300 mM KNO3) incubated with
   wheat pollen turned brown within 2 min under intense light (similar to
   600 mu mol photon flux density m(-2)s(-1)), but not in dark. The brown
   medium displayed AgNPs-specific surface plasmon resonance band in its
   absorption spectrum. Light microscopic studies showed the presence of
   uniformly stained brown protoplasm in viable pollen incubated with
   Ag+-viability medium in the presence of light. Investigations with
   transmission electron microscope coupled with energy dispersive X-ray
   established the presence of distinct 5-35 nm NPs composed of Ag. Powder
   X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that AgNPs were crystalline and
   biphasic composed of Ag-0 and Ag2O. Conversely, non-viable pollen and
   heat-killed pollen did not turn brown on incubation with Ag(+-)medium in
   light. We believe that the viable wheat pollen turn brown rapidly by
   bio-transforming Ag+ to AgNPs through photoreduction. Our findings
   furnish a novel simplest and rapid method for testing wheat pollen
   viability.}},

Abstract = {{Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide. Even
   if 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is used as the first-line chemotherapeutic
   drug, responsiveness is only 20-30\%. Acquired resistance to 5-FU
   contributes to both poor patient prognosis and relapse, emphasizing the
   need to identify biomarkers. Sortilin, a vacuolar protein sorting 10
   protein (Vps10p), implicated in protein trafficking, is over expressed
   in CRC cell lines cultured 72 hours in presence of 5-FU. This
   overexpression was also observed in 5-FU-resistant cells derived from
   these cell lines as well as in CRC primary cultures (or patients derived
   cell lines). A significantly higher expression of sortilin was observed
   in vivo, in 5-FU-treated tumours engrafted in Nude mice, as compared
   with non-treated tumour. A study of transcriptional regulation allowed
   identifying a decrease in ATF3 expression, as an explanation of sortilin
   overexpression following 5-FU treatment. In silico analysis revealed
   SORT1 expression correlation with poor prognosis. Moreover, sortilin
   expression was found to be positively correlated with CRC tumour grades.
   Collectively, our findings identify sortilin as a potential biomarker of
   5-FU resistance associated with poor clinical outcomes and
   aggressiveness in CRC. As a new prognostic factor, sortilin expression
   could be used to fight against CRC.}},

Title = {{Streptococcus thermophilus growth in soya milk: Sucrose consumption,
   nitrogen metabolism, soya protein hydrolysis and role of the cell-wall
   protease PrtS}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{335}},
Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{Societal demand for plant-based foods is increasing. In this context,
   soya products fermented using lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are appealing
   because of their potential health and nutritional benefits. The
   thermophilic LAB Streptococcus thermophilus is an essential starter
   species in the dairy industry. However, while its physiology is well
   characterized, little is known about its general metabolic activity or
   its techno-functional properties when it is grown in soya milk. In this
   study, S. thermophilus LMD-9 growth, sugar production, and lactic acid
   production in soya milk versus cow's milk were measured. Additionally,
   the main metabolic pathways used by the bacterium when growing in soya
   milk were characterized using a proteomic approach. Streptococcus
   thermophilus LMD-9 growth decreased soya milk pH, from 7.5 to 4.9, in 5
   h. During fermentation, acidification thus occurred in tandem with
   lactate production and increasing population size (final population: 1.0
   x 10(9) CFU/ml). As growth proceeded, sucrose was consumed, and fructose
   was produced. The proteomic analysis (LC-MS/MS) of the strain's
   cytosolic and cell envelope-associated proteins revealed that proteins
   related to amino acid transport and nitrogen metabolism were the most
   common among the 328 proteins identified (63/328 = 19.2\% of total
   proteins). The cell-wall protease PrtS was present, and an LMD-9
   deletion mutant was constructed by interrupting the prtS gene
   (STER\_RS04165 locus). Acidification levels, growth levels, and final
   population size were lower in the soya milk cultures when the AprtS
   strain versus the wild-type (wt) strain was used. The SDS-PAGE profile
   of the soluble proteins in the supernatant indicated that soya milk
   proteins were less hydrolyzed by the AprtS strain than by the wt strain.
   It was discovered that S. thermophilus can grow in soya milk by
   consuming sucrose, can hydrolyze soya proteins, and can produce
   acidification levels comparable to those in cow's milk. This study
   comprehensively examined the proteomics of S. thermophilus grown in soya
   milk and demonstrated that the cell-wall protease PrtS is involved in
   the LAB'S growth in soya milk and in the proteolysis of soya proteins,

Abstract = {{In the technician dispatching problem, a given number of repair teams
   must visit different locations to provide service support. Considering
   that there is a fixed vehicle capacity and variations in the demand, not
   all requests can be satisfied on time and therefore some of them must be
   delayed. Most implementations of the dispatching problem consider a
   penalty that might vary depending on the customers to internalize that
   they have heterogeneous costs for being postponed. In this research we
   analyze how such variations in costs affect the outcome of service
   planning in the context of an efficient technician dispatching problem.
   We focus our analysis on two objectives: first, to understand how cost
   heterogeneity affects the performance of optimal solutions, and second
   to illustrate how a firm could implement an ad-hoc methodology even in
   cases where only observable customers' features can be traced.
   Specifically, we explore how the distribution of costs affects optimal
   solutions of allocating teams during a daily operation of the service
   provider, and then we propose a Markovian model to capture
   cost-heterogeneity for the case where the cost of failure can be traced
   to observable operational characteristics. In this model we explicitly
   consider the cost faced by the customer by having inferior service
   quality. Our results indicate that when customers are sufficiently
   different, transportation and total penalty costs decrease gaining in
   operational efficiency. Moreover, results from the Markovian model
   indicate that firms can take advantage of these operational gains even
   in cases where only few customer characteristics are observed. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{Purpose To evaluate the anti-haze effect and visual outcome after
   intraoperative mitomycin C (MMC) use during photorefractive keratectomy
   (PRK) in myopia or myopic astigmatism patients.
   Methods We searched in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Google
   Scholar comprehensively to obtain studies comparing the clinical effects
   after PRK with and without MMC published until February 2020.
   Meta-analysis of primary outcome (corneal haze rate) and secondary
   outcomes {[}predictability, efficacy, safety and corneal endothelial
   cell density (ECD)] were conducted. We used trial sequential analysis
   (TSA) in an effort to collect firm evidence supporting our conclusion.
   Results Of the included 11 randomized controlled trials, five cohort and
   one case-control studies, 3536 eyes (2232 and 1304 in the MMC and
   control groups, respectively) were enrolled for meta-analysis. The TSA
   disclosed strong evidence of decline in corneal haze rate in the MMC
   group compared with that of the control group. In the subgroup analysis
   of duration, MMC seemed to reduce corneal haze rate in early-onset and
   late-onset haze. Predictability of refraction and visual acuity were
   greater in the MMC groups, not significantly though. The proportion of
   patients losing at least two lines of best corrected visual acuity
   postoperatively in the MMC groups was lower than that in the control
   groups. The corneal postoperative ECD showed no significant difference
   between the MMC and control groups.
   Conclusion Our meta-analysis revealed that MMC is an important anti-haze
   agent in PRK for reducing both early- and late-onset haze and can also
   help improving predictability of refraction and subjective postoperative
   visual acuity.}},

Abstract = {{Treatment of hyperkalemia with intravenous insulin-dextrose is
   associated with a risk of hypoglycemia. We aimed to determine the
   factors associated with hypoglycemia (glucose<3.9 mmol/L, or<70 mg/dL)

   retrospective cohort study in a tertiary hospital network, we included
   421 adult patients with a serum potassium >= 6.0 mmol/L who received
   insulin-dextrose treatment. The mean age was 70 years with 62\% male
   predominance. The prevalence of diabetes was 60\%, and 70\% had chronic
   kidney disease (eGFR<60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). The incidence of hypoglycemia
   was 21\%. In a multivariable logistic regression model, the factors
   independently associated with hypoglycemia were: body mass index (per 5
   kg/m(2), OR 0.85, 95\% CI: 0.69-0.99, P=0.04), eGFR<60 mL/min/1.73 m(2)

Journal = {{POLITICAL STUDIES}},
Abstract = {{In The Fable of the Bees, Bernard Mandeville declared that `it is
   impossible we could be sociable Creatures without Hypocrisy'. Mandeville
   set out his ideas of sociability against Anthony Ashley Cooper, Third
   Earl of Shaftesbury, whose notions of virtue he dismissed as `a vast
   Inlet to Hypocrisy'. The main goal of this article is to reconstruct
   Mandeville's account of hypocrisy, first by explaining why he accords it
   such a prominent role in understanding our moral and social norms, and,
   second, by piecing together his criticisms of Shaftesbury's rival
   ethical theory. In doing so, the article outlines a more general
   Mandevillean framework for assessing when hypocrisy is likely to prove
   either socially beneficial or pernicious, while also examining what is
   at stake in choosing to expose rather than tolerate other people's
   hypocrisy.}},

Journal = {{ACS CHEMICAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{4262-4269}},
Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is an important barrier that separates
   brain tissue from peripheral blood. The permeability of the BBB can be
   destroyed by external harmful factors, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS),
   which contributes to neuroinflammation and central nervous system
   diseases. The present study aims to investigate the protective effects
   of Omarigliptin against LPS-induced neuroinflammation and the underlying
   mechanism using a series of both in vivo and in vitro experiments. A
   neuroinflammation model was established by intraperitoneal injection of
   LPS into mice. We found that administration of Omarigliptin reduced
   LPS-induced inflammatory responses by inhibiting the expressions of
   interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and tumor necrosis
   factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Importantly, we found that Omarigliptin
   protected the integrity of the BBB against LPS by increasing the
   expression of the tight junction proteins claudin-1 and claudin-5. Our
   results also demonstrate that Omarigliptin reduced LPS-induced increase
   in expressions of matrix matalloproteinases-2 ( P-2) and matrix
   matalloproteinases-9 (MMP-9) at both the mRNA and protein levels.
   Notably, Omarigliptin showed a powerful beneficial effect against
   LPS-induced cell damage in bEnd.3 brain endothelial cells by reducing
   the release of high mobility group box chromosomal protein 1 (HMGB-1).
   Consistently, Omarigliptin ameliorated LPS-induced exacerbation of
   endothelial permeability by increasing the expressions of claudin-1 and
   claudin-5 and reducing the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9.
   Mechanistically, Omarigliptin inhibited the activation of the toll-like
   receptor 4 (TLR4)/myeloid differentiation factor 88/nuclear factor KB
   (TLR4/Myd88/NF-kappa B) signaling pathway. On the basis of these
   findings, we concluded that Omarigliptin might mitigate LPS-induced
   neuroinflammation and dysfunction of the integrity of the blood-brain
   barrier.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED NETWORK SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{Successful navigation of the Covid-19 pandemic is predicated on public
   cooperation with safety measures and appropriate perception of risk, in
   which emotion and attention play important roles. Signatures of public
   emotion and attention are present in social media data, thus natural
   language analysis of this text enables near-to-real-time monitoring of
   indicators of public risk perception. We compare key epidemiological
   indicators of the progression of the pandemic with indicators of the
   public perception of the pandemic constructed from similar to 20 million
   unique Covid-19-related tweets from 12 countries posted between 10th
   March and 14th June 2020. We find evidence of psychophysical
   numbing:Twitter users increasingly fixate on mortality, but in a
   decreasingly emotional and increasingly analytic tone. Semantic network
   analysis based on word co-occurrences reveals changes in the emotional
   framing of Covid-19 casualties that are consistent with this hypothesis.
   We also find that the average attention afforded to national Covid-19
   mortality rates is modelled accurately with the Weber-Fechner and power
   law functions of sensory perception. Our parameter estimates for these
   models are consistent with estimates from psychological experiments, and
   indicate that users in this dataset exhibit differential sensitivity by
   country to the national Covid-19 death rates. Our work illustrates the
   potential utility of social media for monitoring public risk perception
   and guiding public communication during crisis scenarios.}},

Title = {{Evidence of no horizontal or vertical transmission of tomato severe
   rugose virus by Bemisia tabaci MEAM1}},
Journal = {{PLANT PATHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{70}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{987-993}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Bemisia tabaci is important in agriculture worldwide, mainly because it
   is a vector of numerous plant viruses, probably the most important of
   which are members of the genus Begomovirus. Dozens of begomoviruses have
   been reported to infect tomato plants in Brazil, although tomato severe
   rugose virus (ToSRV) predominates in tomato crops. ToSRV, found so far
   only in Brazil, is efficiently transmitted by B. tabaci MEAM1. However,
   no studies have assessed the occurrence of vertical and horizontal
   transmission of the virus in the insect, which may have epidemiological
   consequences affecting disease management. This study evaluated the
   possibility of transmission of ToSRV between whiteflies during
   copulation and transovarial transmission from viruliferous females of B.
   tabaci MEAM1 to their progeny. Transmission of ToSRV did not occur
   during mating between males and females of B. tabaci MEAM1.
   Aviruliferous males and females confined with viruliferous insects of
   the opposite sex were also unable to transmit the virus to tomato
   plants. ToSRV was detected, by PCR, in the ovaries of viruliferous
   females of B. tabaci MEAM1 but not in eggs, nymphs, or adults of the
   progeny of viruliferous females. Adult progeny of viruliferous females
   also did not transmit ToSRV to tomato plants. Together, the results
   indicate that vertical and horizontal transmission of ToSRV by B. tabaci
   MEAM1 is unlikely. Sustainable management of the tomato golden mosaic
   disease caused by ToSRV should continue to focus on using resistant
   varieties, managing sources of inoculum around tomato fields, and

Abstract = {{Cyclic distillation can increase the column efficiency that is evident
   from either more separation with the same number of stages or fewer
   stages for the same separation. Cyclic flash distillation, the single
   stage limit of cyclic distillation without reflux, is batch distillation
   with repeated charges of feed. Continuous flash distillation is normally
   a single stage separation technique, but one variant, column flash
   distillation, has multiple stages. Column flash distillation is not a
   common separation process, but it is used commercially during partial
   condensation of hydrocarbon gas mixtures. In traditional batch
   distillation, the still pot is heated, and some of the batch is boiled
   away. A second batch operating method first loads the still pot with
   liquid feed, and then, vapor feed is added. A third method combines the
   previous two methods. Although traditional simple batch distillation
   requires significantly less energy than continuous flash distillation,
   batch distillation is rarely employed because it is believed that it is
   difficult to interface batch operations with the continuous processes in
   continuous plants. In this paper, binary separations by the following
   systems are compared: batch distillation, conventional flash
   distillation, continuous column flash distillation, and cyclic column
   flash distillation. The results show significant improvement when batch
   distillation or continuous column flash distillation replaces continuous
   conventional flash distillation and very modest improvement when cyclic
   column flash distillation replaces continuous column flash distillation.}},

Abstract = {{Sawdust is a natural composite obtained from natural resources such as
   shrubs and trees and in a large amount from the wood industry as a
   waste. This study aimed to evaluate the mechanical and water absorption
   properties of alkaline-treated wood sawdust-reinforced polypropylene
   composite. The composites were manufactured by the melt-mixing method
   followed by compression molding with amounts of wood sawdust ranging
   from 10, 20, 30, and 40 to 50 wt. \% by volume. The produced composites
   were characterized for their mechanical and water absorption
   characteristics. The results indicated that increasing the amount of
   wood sawdust content up to 40\% improves the tensile, flexural, impact,
   and compressive strength of the composites but after the wood sawdust
   contents reach 40\%, the mechanical properties of the composite were
   decreased. Water absorption rate has increased with an increase in the
   wood sawdust proportion; this is due to the presence of -OH groups on
   the surface of wood particles. From the result of this study, it can be
   also concluded that the optimal mechanical and water absorption
   properties were attained at 40\% wood sawdust content. Therefore,
   sawdust can be used as filler and reinforcement in the PP matrix, which
   will reduce cost and give environmental benefits.}},

Abstract = {{Cancer phototheranostics in the second nearinfrared window (NIR-II,
   1000-1700 nm) has recently attracted much attention owing to its high
   efficacy and good safety compared with that in the first near-infrared
   window (NIR-I, 650-950 nm). However, the lack of theranostic nanoagents
   with activetargeting features limits its further application in cancer
   precision therapies. Herein, we constructed platelet-camouflaged
   nanoprobes with active-targeting characteristics for NIR-II cancer
   phototheranostics. The as-prepared biomimetic nanoprobes can not only
   escape phagocytosis by macrophages but also specifically bind to CD44 on
   the surface of most cancer cells. We evaluated the active-targeting
   performance of biomimetic nanoprobes in pancreatic cancer, breast
   cancer, and glioma mouse models and achieved NIR-II photoacoustic
   imaging with a high signal-to-background ratio and photothermal
   treatment with excellent tumor growth inhibition. Our results show the
   great potential of platelet-camouflaged nanoprobes with NIR-II
   active-targeting features for cancer precision diagnosis and efficient

Abstract = {{In the 1970's, a controversy arose about a probability problem posed by
   Irving Copi. One side argued that a common spontaneous intuition about
   the problem is correct; the other side argued that this intuition is
   mistaken. Here, I argue (1) that the naive intuition yields the correct
   answer, but accidentally and for a wrong reason; (2) that a more
   reflective intuition yields a wrong answer, and hence, is also mistaken;
   and (3) that an even more reflective intuition yields the correct answer
   for a correct reason. This warrants what I call optimistic fallibilism
   concerning intuitions about probability: although intuition is certainly
   prone to error in this domain, intuition has the capacity for
   self-correction. A naive intuition that is mistaken can be replaced by a
   distinct, reflective intuition; and a reflective intuition that is
   mistaken can be replaced by another reflective intuition - with the
   process ultimately yielding a sound intuition.}},

Abstract = {{The risk of extensive exposure of the human epidermis to solar
   ultraviolet radiation is significantly increased nowadays. It not only
   induces skin aging and solar erythema but also increases the possibility
   of skin cancer. Therefore, a simply prepared, highly sensitive, and
   optically readable device for monitoring the solar ultraviolet radiation
   is highly desired for the skin health management. Because of the
   photoinitiated polymerization triggered by graphene-carbon nitride
   (g-C3N4) under ultraviolet radiation, g-C3N4 is homogeneously
   distributed in the hybrid hydrogels containing N-isopropylacrymide
   (NIPAM), poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (OEGMA(300)),
   and sodium alginate (SA). By further immersing the hybrid hydrogels into
   calcium chloride solution, hybrid
   alginate-Ca2+/P(NIPAM-co-OEGMA(300))/g-C3N4 interpenetrating polymeric
   network (IPN) hydrogels are obtained. Due to the homogeneous
   distribution of g-C3N4 and the existence of thermoresponsive polymers,
   the hybrid IPN hydrogels present good adsorption capability and high
   degradation efficiency for methylene blue (MB) especially at high
   temperature under ultraviolet radiation. Based on this unique property,
   the bracelet monitoring skin health is prepared by simply immersing the
   hybrid IPN hydrogels into the MB solution and then wrapping it with PET
   foil. Because the immersion time for the top, middle, and bottom parts
   of the hybrid IPN hydrogels is gradually increased, their colors vary
   from light to dark blue. A longer time is required for the discoloration
   of the darker part under solar ultraviolet radiation. Thus, the bracelet
   can be used to conveniently monitor the dose of solar ultraviolet
   radiation by simply checking the discoloration in the bracelet under
   sunshine. Due to the facile preparation and low cost of the bracelet, it
   is a promising candidate for wearable devices for skin health
   management.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for the treatment of
   rotator cuff disease is still controversial. The purpose of the present
   study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of a fully
   characterized allogeneic pure PRP injection into the subacromial space
   of patients with rotator cuff disease in comparison with corticosteroid
   injection.
   Methods: A 2-group, parallel, assessor-blinded, randomized controlled
   trial was conducted. A total of 60 patients with clinically and
   structurally diagnosed rotator cuff disease were randomly assigned to
   receive a subacromial injection of either 4mL of allogeneic pure PRP or
   a 4-mLmixture of 1mL of 40-mg/mL triamcinolone acetonide and 3mL of 2\%
   lidocaine under ultrasonographic guidance. The primary outcomes were
   safety and the Constant score at 1 month. The secondary outcomes were
   pain, range of motion, muscle strength, functional scores, and overall
   satisfaction and function.
   Results: There were no treatment-related adverse events. The Constant
   score at 1 month did not significantly differ between the PRP and
   corticosteroid groups. At 6 months, the DASH (Disabilities of the Arm,
   Shoulder and Hand) score, overall function, and external rotation were
   significantly better in the PRP group than in the corticosteroid group,
   and the other clinical outcomes did not show significant differences.
   All pain measurements, the strength of the supraspinatus and
   infraspinatus, and 5 functional scores also improved slowly and steadily
   after injection, becoming significantly better at 6 months compared with
   those before the injection, whereas those in the corticosteroid group
   responded promptly but did not further improve.
   Conclusions: Allogeneic PRP injections for the treatment of rotator cuff
   disease are safe but are not definitely superior to corticosteroid
   injections with respect to pain relief and functional improvement during
   6 months. The DASH score, overall function, and external rotation were
   significantly better in the PRP group than in the steroid group at 6
   months. Generally, PRP slowly but steadily reduced pain and improved
   function of the shoulder until 6 months, whereas corticosteroid did not.}},

Abstract = {{Ensuring the provision of essential ecosystem services in systems
   affected by multiple stressors is a key challenge for theoretical and
   applied ecology. Trait-based approaches have increasingly been used in
   multiple-stressor research in freshwaters because they potentially
   provide a powerful method to explore the mechanisms underlying changes
   in populations and communities. Individual benthic macroinvertebrate
   traits associated with mobility, life history, morphology, and feeding
   habits are often used to determine how environmental drivers structure
   stream communities. However, to date multiple-stressor research on
   stream invertebrates has focused more on taxonomic than on functional
   metrics. We conducted a fully crossed, 4-factor experiment in 64 stream
   mesocosms fed by a pristine montane stream (21 days of colonization, 21
   days of manipulations) and investigated the effects of nutrient
   enrichment, flow velocity reduction and sedimentation on invertebrate
   community, taxon, functional diversity and trait variables after 2 and 3
   weeks of stressor exposure. 89\% of the community structure metrics,
   59\% of the common taxa, 50\% of functional diversity metrics, and 79\%
   of functional traits responded to at least one stressor each. Deposited
   fine sediment and flow velocity reduction had the strongest impacts,
   affecting invertebrate abundances and diversity, and their effects
   translated into a reduction of functional redundancy. Stressor effects
   often varied between sampling occasions, further complicating the
   prediction of multiple-stressor effects on communities. Overall, our
   study suggests that future research combining community, trait, and
   functional diversity assessments can improve our understanding of
   multiple-stressor effects and their interactions in running waters.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, the coupling of biofuel fermentation broths and pervaporation
   has been receiving increasing attention. Some challenges, such as the
   destructive effects of constituents of the real fermentation broth on
   the membrane performances, the lethal effects of the membrane surface
   chemical modifiers on the microorganisms, and being expensive, are
   against this concept. For the first time, a continuous study on the
   one-step and low-cost preparation of superhydrophobic membranes for
   bioethanol separation is made to address these challenges. In our
   previous work, spraying as a fast, scalable, and low-cost procedure was
   applied to fabricate the one-layered active-layer hydrophobic (OALH)
   silicalite-1/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane on the low-cost
   mullite support. In this work, the spraying method was adopted to
   fabricate a two-layered active-layer superhydrophobic (TALS)
   silicalite-1/PDMS membrane, where the novel active layer consisted of
   two layers with different hydrophobicities and densities. Contact-angle
   measurements, surface charge determination, scanning electron
   microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and pervaporation separation using
   a 5 wt \% ethanol solution were used to statically evaluate the
   fouling/biofouling resistance and pervaporation performances of OALH and
   TALS membranes in this study. The TALS membrane presented a better
   resistance and performance. For dynamic experiments, the Box-Behnken
   design was used to identify the effects of substrates, microorganisms,
   and nutrient contents as the leading indicators of fermentation broth on
   the TALS membrane performances for the long-term utilization. The
   maximum performances of 1.88 kg/m(2). h, 32.34, and 59.04 kg/m(2).h
   concerning the permeation flux, separation factor, and pervaporation
   separation index were obtained, respectively. The dynamic
   fouling/biofouling resistance of the TALS membrane was also
   characterized using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy of all the
   tested membranes. The TALS membrane demonstrated the synergistic
   resistance of membrane fouling and biofouling. Eventually, the novel
   TALS membrane was found to have potential for biofuel recovery,
   especially bioethanol.}},

Abstract = {{Importance While regression is a commonly reported microscopic feature
   of melanoma, its prognostic significance is unclear.
   Objective To examine the impact of regression on sentinel node status
   and the likelihood of recurrence in primary cutaneous melanoma of the
   head and neck.
   Design Retrospective analysis of 191 adults who underwent surgical
   management for primary cutaneous melanoma of the head and neck between
   May 2002 and March 2019.
   Setting Tertiary academic center.
   Participants Patients appropriate for the study were identified by the
   Academic Health Center Information Exchange using a list of current
   procedural terminology codes. One hundred and ninety-one cases of
   invasive melanoma of the head and neck were included from 830 patients
   identified. Clinical features assessed for each patient included age,
   sex, location of primary lesion, date of diagnosis, and current disease
   status (alive with or without disease). Histologic features assessed
   were histological melanoma subtype (nodular vs non-nodular), Breslow
   thickness, Clark level, presence/absence of ulceration, mitotic rate per
   square millimeter, and regression. If applicable, sentinel lymph node
   biopsy (SLNB) status, date of recurrence, interval treatments, and date
   of death related to melanoma were recorded. Exclusion criteria included
   melanoma outside the anatomic parameters of head and neck, ocular or
   choroidal melanoma, mucosal melanoma, metastatic melanoma to the head or
   neck with no known primary tumor, melanoma of the head or neck with no
   surgical intervention, and non-melanoma skin cancers of the head and
   neck.
   Intervention/Exposure Surgery for cutaneous melanoma of the head and
   neck.
   Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s) The association between presence of
   regression and Breslow thickness, sentinel node status, and recurrence.
   Results Of the 191 patients identified, 30.9\% were female and 69.1\%
   were male with a mean age at diagnosis of 62.6 (range 20-97) years. Mean
   Breslow thickness was 1.2 mm in those with regression and 2.0 mm in
   those without regression. In patients with regression, 17.6\% had a
   positive sentinel node, and 13.0\% experienced a recurrence. In patients
   without regression, 26.5\% had a positive sentinel node, and 31.4\%
   experienced a recurrence. When adjusted for other factors above,
   regression was not associated with positive sentinel node (odds ratio
   {[}OR] = 0.59, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] = 0.13-2.00) or
   recurrence (OR = 0.33, CI = 0.07-1.01). Mitotic rate >2 was associated
   with recurrence (OR = 2.71, CI = 1.11-6.75, P = .03).
   Conclusions and Relevance Patients with presence of regression had
   thinner melanomas and trended toward decreased rates of sentinel node
   positivity and recurrence, suggesting regression may not be a negative
   prognostic indicator in patients with cutaneous melanoma of the head and
   neck.}},

Title = {{Check the gap: Facemask performance and exhaled aerosol distributions
   around the wearer}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{Current facemask research focuses on material characterization and
   efficiency; however, facemasks are often not tested such that aerosol
   distributions are evaluated from the gaps in the sides, bottom, and nose
   areas. Poor evaluation methods could lead to misinformation on optimal
   facemasks use; a high-throughput, reproducible method which illuminates
   the issue of fit influencing aerosol transmission is needed. To this
   end, we have created an in vitro model to quantify particle transmission
   by mimicking exhalation aerosols in a 3D printed face-nose-mouth replica
   via a nebulizer and quantifying particle counts using a hand-held
   particle counter. A sewn, sewn with pipe cleaner nose piece, and sewn
   with a coffee filter facemask were used to evaluate current common
   homemade sewn facemask designs, benchmarked against industry standard
   surgical, N95 respirator tightly fit, and N95 respirator loosely fit
   facemasks. All facemasks have significantly reduced particle counts in
   front of the facemask, but the side and top of the facemask showed
   increases in particle counts over the no facemask condition at that same
   position, suggesting that some proportion of aerosols are being
   redirected to these gaps. An altered size distribution of aerosols that
   escape at the vulnerable positions was observed; escaped particles have
   larger count median diameters, with a decreased ratio of smaller to
   larger particles, possibly due to hygroscopic growth or aggregation. Of
   the homemade sewn facemasks, the facemask with a coffee filter insert
   performed the best at reducing escaped aerosols, with increased
   efficiency also observed for sewn masks with a pipe cleaner nose piece.
   Importantly, there were minimal differences between facemasks at
   increasing distances, which supports that social distance is a critical
   element in reducing aerosol transmission. This work brings to light the
   importance of quantifying particle count in positions other than
   directly in front of the facemask and identifies areas of research to be
   explored.}},

   whether mind-mindedness generalizes to representations of unknown

   adults' tendency to interpret others' behavior with reference to their
   internal states: the Unknown Mother-Infant Interaction Task (UMIIT). We
   compared UMIIT performance with measures of mind-mindedness from (a)
   adults' descriptions of close friends and partners (Study 1, N = 96) and
   (b) mothers' appropriate versus nonattuned comments on their infants'
   internal states (Study 2, N = 56). In line with the proposal that
   mind-mindedness is a relational construct, UMIIT performance was
   unrelated to mind-mindedness in both studies.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Systemic inflammation is associated with alterations in complex brain
   functions such as learning and memory. However, diagnostic approaches to
   functionally assess and quantify inflammation-associated alterations in
   synaptic plasticity are not well-established. In previous work, we
   demonstrated that bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced systemic
   inflammation alters the ability of hippocampal neurons to express
   synaptic plasticity, i.e., the long-term potentiation (LTP) of
   excitatory neurotransmission. Here, we tested whether synaptic
   plasticity induced by repetitive magnetic stimulation (rMS), a
   non-invasive brain stimulation technique used in clinical practice, is
   affected by LPS-induced inflammation. Specifically, we explored brain
   tissue cultures to learn more about the direct effects of LPS on neural
   tissue, and we tested for the plasticity-restoring effects of the
   anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 (IL10). As shown previously,
   10 Hz repetitive magnetic stimulation (rMS) of organotypic
   entorhino-hippocampal tissue cultures induced a robust increase in
   excitatory neurotransmission onto CA1 pyramidal neurons. Furthermore,
   LPS-treated tissue cultures did not express rMS-induced synaptic
   plasticity. Live-cell microscopy in tissue cultures prepared from a
   novel transgenic reporter mouse line {[}C57BL/6-Tg(TNFa-eGFP)] confirms
   that ex vivo LPS administration triggers microglial tumor necrosis
   factor alpha (TNF alpha) expression, which is ameliorated in the
   presence of IL10. Consistent with this observation, IL10 hampers the
   LPS-induced increase in TNF alpha, IL6, IL1 beta, and IFN gamma and
   restores the ability of neurons to express rMS-induced synaptic
   plasticity in the presence of LPS. These findings establish organotypic
   tissue cultures as a suitable model for studying inflammation-induced
   alterations in synaptic plasticity, thus providing a biological basis
   for the diagnostic use of transcranial magnetic stimulation in the
   context of brain inflammation.}},

Abstract = {{The molecular alterations that initiate the development of multiple
   myeloma (MM) are not fully understood. Our results revealed that TJP1
   was downregulated in MM and positively related to the overall survival
   of MM patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and patient
   samples. In parallel, cell adhesion capacity representing MM metastasis
   was decreased in MM patients compared with healthy samples, together
   with the significantly activated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
   (EMT) transcriptional-like patterns of MM cells. Further analyses
   demonstrated that TJP1 negatively regulated EMT and consequently
   positively regulated cell adhesion in MM from TCGA database and MM1 s
   cells. Furthermore, the methylation level of each CpG site on the TJP1
   promoter was negatively correlated with TJP1 expression levels.
   Quantitative real-time P CR and western blot assays demonstrated that
   methylase DNMT1 regulated the methylation of TJP1. Finally, treatment
   with a combination of the MM clinical medicine bortezomib, methylation
   inhibitor, or TJP1 overexpression significantly suppressed the viability
   and progression of tumor cells of MM orthotopic models. In summary, our
   results indicate that DNMT1 promotes the methylation of TJP1 promoter,
   thereby decreasing its expression and regulating the development of
   EMT-inhibited MM cell adhesion. Therefore, methylation of TJP1 is a
   potential therapeutic agent to prevent the progression of MM disease.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new direct vertex-centred finite volume method (CV-FEM)
   has been developed for the thermoelastic problem in functional graded
   material (FGM) based on Lord-Shulman theory. The heat conduction
   equation in Lord-Shulman theory is modified by considering the product
   term of spatial gradient of relaxation time and the heat flux rate, and
   it makes the present method more accurate to capture characteristics of
   a thermoelastic wave in inhomogeneous and FGM compared with previous
   methods. Some benchmark examples are used to demonstrate the capability
   of the present method for hyperbolic heat conduction and thermoelastic
   coupled problems. The effects of the `product-term' on the wave
   propagation are studied by a heat conduction problem in inhomogeneous
   material and a thermoelastic problem in FGM. The FGM results show that
   its effect on the thermoelastic response is significant even for a
   linear variation of material properties.}},

Abstract = {{CeO2-coated Pd core-shell units with thin shell was synthesized and

Title = {{Growth and changes in the pediatric medical subspecialty workforce

Journal = {{PEDIATRIC RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Background To inform discussions of pediatric subspecialty workforce
   adequacy and characterize its pipeline, we examined trends in first-year
   fellows in the 14 American Board of Pediatrics (ABP)-certified pediatric
   medical subspecialties, 2001-2018. Methods Data were obtained from the
   ABP Certification Management System. We determined, within each
   subspecialty, the annual number of first-year fellows. We assessed for
   changes in the population using variables available throughout the study
   period (gender, medical school location, program region, and program
   size). We fit linear trendlines and calculated chi(2) statistics.
   Results The number of first-year pediatric medical subspecialty fellows
   increased from 751 in 2001 to 1445 in 2018. Fields with the growth of 3
   or more fellows per year were Cardiology, Critical Care, Emergency
   Medicine, Gastroenterology, Neonatology, and Hematology Oncology (P
   value <0.05 for all). The number of fellows entering Adolescent
   Medicine, Child Abuse, Infectious Disease, and Nephrology increased at a
   rate of 0.5 fellows or fewer per year. Female American Medical Graduates
   represented the largest and growing proportions of several
   subspecialties. Distribution of programs by region and size were
   relatively consistent over time, but varied across subspecialties.
   Conclusions The number of pediatricians entering medical subspecialty
   fellowship training is uneven and patterns of growth differ between
   subspecialties. Impact
   The number of individuals entering fellowship training has increased
   between 2001 and 2018. Growth in the number of first-year fellows is
   uneven. Fields with the greatest growth: Critical Care, Emergency
   Medicine, and Neonatology. Fields with limited growth: Adolescent
   Medicine, Child Abuse, Infectious Disease, and Nephrology. Concerns
   about the pediatric medical subspecialty workforce are not explained by
   the number of individuals entering the fellowship.}},

Title = {{Characterization of very wide companion candidates to young stars with
   planets and disks}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{644}},
Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{Discovering wide companions of stellar systems allows us to constrain
   the dynamical environment and age of the latter. We studied four
   probable wide companions of four different stellar systems. The
   candidates were selected mainly based on their similar kinematic
   properties to the central star using Gaia DR2. The central stars are
   V4046 Sgr, HIP 74865, HIP 65426, and HIP 73145, and their probable wide
   companions are 2MASS J18152222-3249329, 2MASS J15174874-3028484, 2MASS
   J13242119-5129503, and 2MASS J14571503-3543505 respectively. V4046 Sgr
   is a member of beta -Pictoris Moving Group while the rest of the stellar
   systems are acknowledged as members of the Scorpius-Centaurus
   association. The selected stellar systems are particularly interesting
   because all of them are already known to possess a low-mass companion
   and/or a spatially resolved disk. Identifying wider companions of these
   stars can improve their eligibility as benchmarks for understanding the
   formation channels of various triple systems, and can help us to
   determine the orbits of their possibly undiscovered inner, wider
   companions in case of higher multiplicity. By analyzing the X-shooter
   spectra of the wide companion candidates of these stars, we obtained
   their stellar parameters and determined their ages. We find that 2MASS
   J15174874-3028484 (0.11 M-circle dot, 7.4 +/- 0.5 Myr), an already
   recognized pre-main sequence (PMS) member of Scorpius-Centaurus
   association, is a highly probable wide companion of HIP 74865. 2MASS
   J13242119-5129503 (0.04 M-circle dot, 16 +/- 2.2 Myr) is ruled out as a
   plausible wide companion of HIP 65426, but confirmed to be a new
   sub-stellar member of the Scorpius-Centaurus association. 2MASS
   J14571503-3543505 (0.02 M-circle dot, 17.75 +/- 4.15 Myr) is a probable
   sub-stellar member of the same association, but we cannot confirm
   whether or not it is gravitationally bound to HIP 73145. 2MASS
   J18152222-3249329 (0.3 M-circle dot, older than 150 Myr) is determined
   to be a mildly active main sequence star, much older than members of
   beta -Pictoris Moving Group, and unbound to V4046 Sgr despite their
   similar kinematic features. PMS wide companions such as 2MASS
   J15174874-3028484 might have formed through cascade fragmentation of
   their natal molecular core, hinting at high multiplicity in shorter
   separations which can be confirmed with future observations.}},

Abstract = {{Background Classical frequentist statistics, including null-hypothesis
   significance testing (NHST), dominates nursing and medical research
   analysis. However, there is increasing recognition that null-hypothesis
   Bayesian testing (NHBT) merits inclusion in healthcare research
   analysis.
   Aim To recommend that researchers complement the P-value from NHST from
   NHBT in their research analysis.
   Discussion Reporting the P-value and a Bayes factor clarifies results
   that may be difficult to interpret using the P-value alone.
   Conclusion NHBT offers statistical and practical advantages that
   complement NHST.}},

Abstract = {{Studies in laboratory animals have shown that male offspring from dams,
   exposed to nicotine during pregnancy and postnatal periods, show
   alterations in fertility, although the origin of this is still
   uncertain. In this study, we examined in a mouse model if the process of
   gonocyte maturation to spermatogonia was affected in male offspring from
   dams with nicotine administration during pregnancy and postnatal
   periods. BALB/C mice, with and without nicotine administrations in
   pregnancy and postnatal periods, were studied. The animals were
   euthanized at 3, 7, 10, 16, and 35 days postpartum (dpp). Testicular
   tissue samples were processed for histological, ultrastructural, and
   immunohistochemical studies; and testicular lipoperoxidation was
   determined. It was observed that in the nicotine-exposed animals, there
   was increased apoptosis and a reduction in the number of gonocytes that
   matured to spermatogonia. This gonocyte-spermatogonia maturation
   reduction was associated with a greater immunoreactivity to nicotinic
   acetylcholine receptors in the germ cells. Lipoperoxidation was similar
   in both groups until 16 dpp, with significant reduction at 35 dpp. Our
   findings suggest that nicotine intake during pregnancy and postnatal
   periods can affect the process of maturation of gonocytes to
   spermatogonia and the pool of available spermatogonia for
   spermatogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{To ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns, alternative

   have a next-generation reaction process, which will be reactor and

   with reactions flasks, including contamination and alteration of the
   reactants. Here, polymerization, click chemistry, and enzymatic
   reactions can proceed effectively in a floating droplet at a node of
   standing wave generated by ultrasonic levitation. These results
   demonstrate that floating droplets levitated by acoustic waves can
   represent a revolutionary containerless reactor for performing various

Abstract = {{Paediatric heart transplantation recipients suffer an increased
   incidence of infectious, autoimmune and allergic problems. The relative
   roles of thymus excision and immunosuppressive treatments in
   contributing to these sequelae are not clear. We compared the
   immunological phenotypes of 25 heart transplant recipients (Tx), 10
   children who underwent thymus excision during non-transplantation
   cardiac surgery (TE) and 25 age range-matched controls, in two age
   bands: 1-9 and 10-16 years. Significant differences from controls were
   seen mainly in the younger age band with Tx showing lower CD3 and CD4
   cell counts whilst TE showed lower CD8 cell counts. Naive T cell and
   recent thymic emigrant proportions and counts were significantly lower
   than controls in both groups in the lower age band. T cell recombination
   excision circle (TREC) levels were lower than controls in both groups in
   both age bands. There were no differences in regulatory T cells, but in
   those undergoing thymus excision in infancy, their proportions were
   higher in TE than Tx, a possible direct effect of immunosuppression. T
   cell receptor V beta spectratyping showed fewer peaks in both groups
   than in controls (predominantly in the older age band). Thymus excision
   in infancy was associated with lower CD8 cell counts and higher
   proportions of Tregs in TE compared to Tx. These data are consistent
   with thymus excision, particularly in infancy, being the most important
   influence on immunological phenotype after heart transplantation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an enhanced compensation strategy for distributed
   generation (DG) systems to simultaneously achieve accurate power sharing
   and harmonics compensation at the point of common coupling (PCC). In the
   proposed control strategy, the output impedance is modified at the
   fundamental and harmonic frequencies to compensate for the line
   impedance mismatches among DG units, which results in accurate power
   sharing. In addition, load harmonic currents are effectively adjusted by
   the DG units to effectively compensate the PCC voltage harmonics.
   Additionally, the DG equivalent impedance is regulated adaptively to
   ensure accurate harmonic power sharing even in the presence of sudden
   load changes. Furthermore, a distributed communication network is
   adopted instead of a central controller to increase the reliability and
   stability of the microgrid system. The proposed control strategy is
   applied to a prototype microgrid system, and its effectiveness and
   reliability are experimentally validated.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction Good oral health during the prenatal period translates into
   better oral and overall health for women and their infants. Although the
   importance of oral health during pregnancy is well established, oral
   health assessments are not routinely included in prenatal care visits.
   The purpose of this study was to explore prenatal care providers'
   practices regarding oral health assessments and identify reasons for the
   gap in oral health integration in prenatal care. Data were gathered from
   midwives in Virginia, United States. Information on midwives' knowledge
   about oral health, education, practices, and awareness of oral health
   guidelines and the pregnancy-related Medicaid dental benefit policy in
   Virginia was collected.
   Methods An online survey was distributed to midwives practicing in
   Virginia through their state-level professional organization. The data
   were collected online, and descriptive data analyses were conducted.
   Results A total of 30 midwives (mean age 51.9 years) participated in the
   survey for an overall response rate of 13.6\%. Among survey
   participants, knowledge of oral health was high (score of 4.69 out of
   5). Nearly 20\% of participants reported receiving no education about
   oral health during professional training, and 72.4\% reported no receipt
   of continuing education about oral health in the past year. Although
   86\% of the participants reported discussing oral health in clinical
   practice, only 10.3\% reported conducting oral health assessments.
   Awareness of Virginia's Medicaid dental benefit policy was high
   (75.9\%), but less than half of the participants were aware of oral
   health guidelines (44.1\%). Although many midwives did not conduct oral
   health assessments, 79.3\% reported that they provided oral health
   referrals to pregnant patients.
   Discussion Enhancing and integrating education about oral health in the
   academic curriculum for midwives and providing them with opportunities
   for continuing education about oral health can improve their engagement
   with oral health. Sharing of evidence-based guidelines through
   organizational newsletters, meetings, and other venues can be ways to
   increase awareness of new guidelines and health coverage benefits among
   midwives.}},

Abstract = {{It is evident that the exhaustive use of fossil fuels for decades has
   significantly contributed to global warming and environmental pollution.
   To mitigate the harm on the environment, lithium-oxygen batteries (LOBs)
   with a high theoretical energy density (3458 Wh kg(-1) Li2O2) compared
   to that of Li-ion batteries (LIBs) have been considered as an attractive
   alternative to fossil fuels. For this purpose, porous carbon materials
   have been utilized as promising air cathodes owing to their low cost,
   lightness, easy fabrication process, and high performance. However, the
   challenge thus far lies in the uncontrollable formation of Li2CO3 at the
   interface between carbon and Li2O2, which is detrimental to the stable
   electrochemical performance of carbon-based cathodes in LOBs. In this
   work, we successfully protected the surface of the free-standing carbon
   nanofibers (CNFs) by coating it with a layer of iridium metal through
   direct sputtering (CNFs@Ir), which significantly improved the lifespan
   of LOBs. Moreover, the Jr would play a secondary role as an
   electrochemical catalyst. This all-in-one cathode was evaluated for the
   formation and decomposition of Li2O2 during (dis)charging processes.
   Compared with bare CNFs, the CNFsgIr cathode showed two times longer
   lifespan with 0.2 V, lower overpotentials for the oxygen evolution
   reaction. We quantitatively calculated the contents of CO32- in Li2CO3
   formed on the different surfaces of the bare CNFs (63\% reduced) and the
   protected CNFsgIr (78\% reduced) cathodes after charging. The protective
   effects and the reaction mechanism were elucidated by ex situ analyses,
   including scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron
   microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Evidence on the reliability of using procalcitonin (PCT)
   and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) as diagnostic markers
   for early-onset neonatal bacterial infections is still insufficient
   because of their physiological elevation during the early neonatal
   period. This study aimed to assess the respiratory influence of serum
   PCT and hs-CRP levels and evaluate their predictive value for bacterial
   infections during the first 72 h of life in preterm neonates. Methods:
   The preterm neonates enrolled in this single-center retrospective cohort
   study were categorized into 3 groups: reference, infection-unlikely
   respiratory failure, and probable bacterial infection; their serum PCT
   and hs-CRP levels were assessed. Subsequently, age-specific 95th
   percentile curves were plotted and the median and cutoff PCT and hs-CRP
   levels for predicting bacterial infections at birth and 7-18, 19-36, and
   37-72 h after birth were determined. Moreover, the analysis of PCT and
   hs-CRP with a neonatal sequential organ failure assessment (nSOFA) score
   was performed in very low birth weight neonates. Results: Serum PCT
   levels were influenced by respiratory failure. A significant difference
   was found in the median PCT and hs-CRP levels among the 3 groups at each
   time point. PCT sensitivities for predicting bacterial infection were
   slightly higher than those of hs-CRP in each time frame during the first
   72 h of life. In both PCT and hs-CRP, there was no significant
   difference between infants with nSOFA scores of >4 and those with nSOFA
   scores of <= 4. Discussion/Conclusion: Age-specific evaluation showed
   that PCT has better predictive value than hs-CRP for early-onset
   bacterial infections in preterm neonates.}},

Abstract = {{Higher cortisol levels due to a hyperactive
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis have been reported in patients with
   major depressive disorder (MDD). Increased cortisol levels change both
   the brain morphology and function in MDD patients. The multivariate
   source-based morphometry (SBM) technique has been applied to investigate
   neuroanatomical changes in some neuropsychiatric diseases, but not MDD.
   We aimed to examine the alterations in gray matter (GM) networks and
   their relationship with serum cortisol levels in first-episode,
   drug-naive MDD patients using SBM. Forty-two patients with MDD and 39
   controls were recruited via interviews. Morning serum cortisol levels
   were measured, and high-resolution T1-weighted imaging followed by SBM
   analysis was performed in all participants. The patients had
   significantly higher serum cortisol levels than the controls. We found
   two GM sources, which were significantly different between patients with
   MDD and controls (prefrontal network, p<.01; insula-temporal network,
   p<.01). Serum cortisol levels showed a statistically significant
   negative correlation with the loading coefficients of the prefrontal
   network (r=-0.354, p=0.02). In conclusion, increased serum cortisol
   levels were associated with reductions in the prefrontal network in the
   early stage of MDD, and SBM may be a useful approach for analyzing
   structural MRI data.}},

Title = {{Patient-Level Factors Influencing Palliative Care Consultation at a
   Safety-Net Urban Hospital}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HOSPICE \& PALLIATIVE MEDICINE}},
Abstract = {{The influence of patient-level factors on palliative and hospice care is
   unclear. We conducted a retrospective review of 2321 patients aged >= 18
   that died within 6 months of admission to our institution between 2012
   and 2017. Patients were included for analysis if their chart was
   complete, their length of stay was >= 48 hours, and if based on their
   diagnoses, they would have benefited from palliative care consultation
   (PCC). Bayesian regression with a weakly informative prior was used to
   find the odds ratio (OR) and 99\% credible interval (CrI) of receiving
   PCC based on race/ethnicity, education, language, insurance status, and
   income. 730 patients fit our inclusion criteria and 30\% (n = 211)
   received PCC. The OR of receiving PCC was 1.26 (99\% CrI, 0.73-2.12) for
   Blacks, 0.81 (99\% CrI, 0.31-1.86) for Hispanics, and 0.69 (99\% CrI,
   0.19-2.46) for other minorities. Less than high school education was
   associated with greater odds of PCC (OR 2.28, 99\% CrI, 1.09-4.93)
   compared to no schooling. Compared to English speakers, non-English
   speakers had higher odds of receiving PCC when cared for by medical
   services (OR 3.01 {[}99\% CrI, 1.44-5.32]) but lower odds of PCC when
   cared for by surgical services (0.22 {[}99\% CrI, <0.01-3.42]).
   Insurance status and income were not associated with differences in PCC.
   At our institution, we found no evidence of racial/ethnic, insurance, or
   income status affecting PCC while primary language spoken and
   educational status did. Further investigation is warranted to examine
   the system and provider-level factors influencing PCC's low utilization
   by medical and surgical specialties.}},

   Hg in >= 75-year-olds vs. -12.3 mm Hg in <75-year-olds) between baseline
   and week 12, with no significant differences between the groups. In
   addition, there were significant reductions in glycated hemoglobin, body
   weight, and uric acid during 12 weeks of empagliflozin treatment in the
   two age groups. The incidences of hypoglycemic episodes, hypotension,
   and metabolic adverse events were similar in the two groups. Thus,
   empagliflozin was effective and well tolerated in elderly diabetic

   Entrainment data collected from 7 December 2015 to 22 November 2016 at
   the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station (DNGS) using automated
   sampling methodology are discussed in this article, including numbers of
   fish eggs and larvae entrained. We used a more robust sampling design
   than previously used in 2004 and 2006, which involved more frequent
   sampling over a longer, 12 month period. The design allowed collection
   of daily samples with a longer sampling duration and higher total sample
   volumes that reduced variability compared to previous studies with less
   robust sampling throughout a day. Our study resulted in the capture of
   deepwater sculpin and burbot that were not observed in previous
   entrainment studies. The maximum entrainment density for eggs was about
   17 times higher than that for larvae. The entrainment of fish eggs was
   highest in the summer months (June and July) and did not vary diurnally.
   The highest entrainment rates for larvae occurred during the months of
   August and September, with higher densities entrained at night. We
   recommend the use of both increased sampling frequency and sampling
   volumes to characterize fish entrainment for water users in the Great
   Lakes watershed.}},

Abstract = {{People use many kinds of mitigation strategies to resolve human-wildlife
   conflict issues, and their preferences for lethal or non-lethal
   techniques are influenced by socio-cultural factors and their attitudes
   toward the conflict species. We conducted studies in two regions in
   India to investigate factors related to people's choice of conflict
   mitigation strategies against commensal monkey species. We conducted
   qualitative and quantitative, face-to-face interviews to collect data
   and analyzed the relationships among socio-demographic variables,
   strategies used, and duration of conflict. Respondents' choice of
   mitigation strategies was related to their religion, education, and
   conflict history, but not occupation. A small percentage of respondents
   recommended monkey culling as a mitigation strategy, but the majority
   preferred that government authorities use translocation or sterilization
   as a mitigation measure. A deeper understanding of socio-cultural
   beliefs and traditions at regional levels is necessary before mitigation
   strategies are instituted in a generalized manner against conflict
   wildlife.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose Efficacy of current antimalarial treatments is
   declining as a result of increasing antimalarial drug resistance, so new
   and potent antimalarial drugs are urgently needed. Azithromycin, an
   azalide antibiotic, was found useful in malaria therapy, but its
   efficacy in humans is low.
   Experimental Approach Four compounds belonging to structurally different
   azalide classes were tested and their activities compared to
   azithromycin and chloroquine. in vitro evaluation included testing
   against sensitive and resistant Plasmodium falciparum, cytotoxicity
   against HepG2 cells, accumulation and retention in human erythrocytes,
   antibacterial activity, and mode of action studies (delayed death
   phenotype and haem polymerization). in vivo assessment enabled
   determination of pharmacokinetic profiles in mice, rats, dogs, and
   monkeys and in vivo efficacy in a humanized mouse model.
   Key Results Novel fast-acting azalides were highly active in vitro
   against P. falciparum strains exhibiting various resistance patterns,
   including chloroquine-resistant strains. Excellent antimalarial activity
   was confirmed in a P. falciparum murine model by strong inhibition of
   haemozoin-containing trophozoites and quick clearance of parasites from
   the blood. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that compounds are
   metabolically stable and have moderate oral bioavailability, long
   half-lives, low clearance, and substantial exposures, with blood cells
   as the preferred compartment, especially infected erythrocytes. Fast
   anti-plasmodial action is achieved by the high accumulation into
   infected erythrocytes and interference with parasite haem
   polymerization, a mode of action different from slow-acting
   azithromycin.
   Conclusion and Implications The hybrid derivatives described here
   represent excellent antimalarial drug candidates with the potential for
   clinical use in malaria therapy.}},

Title = {{Diatom diversity and distribution in Madeira Island streams (Portugal)}},
Journal = {{BIODIVERSITY DATA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Here, we present the data obtained from the samples collected in a field
   campaign during the spring of 2015 which aims for a better understanding
   of the diversity and distribution patterns of freshwater diatoms in
   Madeira Island. Following European and Portuguese standards and
   recommendations for routine diatom sampling and analysis, we collected
   samples in 40 sites, distributed in 27 permanent streams and identified
   the diatom species present, using general diatom floras and studies in
   Portuguese freshwater diatoms.
   New information
   Little is known about the diversity and distribution of freshwater
   diatom assemblages from Madeira Archipelago. This study reports a survey
   in 40 sites in Madeira Island distributed in 27 permanent streams. A
   total of 965 diatom (Bacillariophyta) occurrences were recorded,
   belonging to 130 different taxa from 44 genera and 27 families. The
   families with the highest number of occurrences were Bacillariaceae
   (176), Achnanthidiaceae (135) and Naviculaceae (133). The two diatom
   endemisms, described previously in Madeira Island (Lange-Bertalot 1993),
   Nitzschia macaronesica Lange-Bertalot and Navicula madeirensis
   Lange-Bertalot, were only observed in a small number of sites, located
   mostly at Laurissilva forest. Sixty species are new records, not only to
   Madeira Island, but also to the Madeira Archipelago.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoencapsulated drug delivery to solid tumors is a promising approach
   to overcome the pharmacokinetic limitations of therapeutic drugs.
   However, encapsulation leads to complex drug biodistribution and
   delivery making analysis of delivery efficacy challenging. As proxies,
   nanocarrier accumulation or total tumor drug uptake in the tumor are
   used to evaluate delivery. Yet these measurements fail to assess the
   delivery of active, released drug to the target, and thus it commonly
   remains unknown if drug-target occupancy is achieved. Here, an approach
   to evaluate the delivery of encapsulated drug to the target is
   developed, where residual drug target vacancy is measured using a
   fluorescent drug analog. In vitro measurements reveal that burst release
   governs drug delivery independent of nanoparticle uptake, and highlight
   limitations of evaluating nanoencapsulated drug delivery in these
   models. In vivo, however, the approach captures successful
   nanoencapsulated delivery, showing that tumor stromal cells drive
   nanoparticle accumulation and mediate drug delivery to adjacent cancer
   cells. These results, and generalizable approach, provide a critical
   advance to evaluate delivery of encapsulated drugs to the drug
   target-the central objective of nanotherapeutics.}},

Abstract = {{In vertebrates, DNA methylation predominantly occurs at CG dinucleotides
   however, widespread nonCG methylation (mCH) has been reported in
   mammalian embryonic stem cells and in the brain. In mammals, mCH is
   found at CAC trinucleotides in the nervous system, where it is
   associated with transcriptional repression, and at CAG trinucleotides in
   embryonic stem cells, where it positively correlates with transcription.
   Moreover, CAC methylation appears to be a conserved feature of adult
   vertebrate brains. Unlike any of those methylation signatures, here we
   describe a novel form of mCH that occurs in the TGCT context within
   zebrafish mosaic satellite repeats. TGCT methylation is inherited from
   both male and female gametes, remodelled during midblastula transition,
   and re-established during gastrulation in all embryonic layers.
   Moreover, we identify DNA methyltransferase 3ba (Dnmt3ba) as the primary
   enzyme responsible for the deposition of this mCH mark. Finally, we
   observe that TGCT-methylated repeats are specifically associated with
   H3K9me3-marked heterochromatin suggestive of a functional interplay
   between these two gene-regulatory marks. Altogether, this work provides
   insight into a novel form of vertebrate mCH and highlights the substrate
   diversity of vertebrate DNA methyltransferases.}},

Abstract = {{Developments in recent electronics result in electronic components that
   produce heat, namely, Central Processing Units (CPUs). One solution to
   this problem is using a heat pipe. In this study, a cascade straight
   heat pipe (CSHP) is analyzed as a CPU cooling system with three
   effective lengths: 20 cm, 23 cm, and 26 cm. The first workload provided
   was Idle; the processor only ran the operating system without a software
   load, so that the processor utilization was only 1-10\%. The second was
   full load, where the processor utilization was 95-100\%. The CSHP-based
   CPU-cooling system with an effective length of 20 cm was able to reach
   processor temperatures of up to 43.32 degrees C (idle) and 63.62 degrees
   C (full load). For the effective length of 23 cm, processor temperatures
   of 46.99 degrees C idle) and 64.81 degrees C full load was attained.
   Lastly, while using the effective length of 26 cm, processor
   temperatures of 50.67 degrees C idle and 65.21 degrees C full load were
   reached. CPU cooling systems using CSHP are thermally resistant when in
   idle conditions; respectively, the temperatures for the effective
   lengths of 20 cm, 23 cm, and 26 cm are 0.168 degrees C/W, 0.197 degrees
   C/W, and 0.223 degrees C/W. In contrast, for the same effective lengths,
   the thermal resistance at full load was 0.262 degrees C/W, 0.236 degrees
   C/W, and 0.224 degrees C/W, respectively. Overall, the cascade heat pipe
   shows better cooling performance than a stock cooler.}},

Title = {{YY1-mediated long non-coding RNA Kcnq1ot1 promotes the tumor progression
   by regulating PTEN via DNMT1 in triple negative breast cancer}},
Journal = {{CANCER GENE THERAPY}},
Abstract = {{Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive cancer, and
   rapidly progresses following relapse in advanced stage. This cancer is
   usually associated with worse overall survival, so the carcinogenesis of
   TNBC needs to be further explored to find more effective therapies. In
   this study, we intended to identify the roles of YY1-mediated long
   non-coding RNA Kcnq1ot1 in TNBC. First, the paired samples of tumor
   tissues and adjacent tissues were collected to determine YY1, lncRNA
   Kcnq1ot1, and PTEN expression using RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis
   followed by analysis of the relationship between them and patient
   survival. The results revealed that YY1 and lncRNA Kcnq1ot1 were
   upregulated in TNBC tissues, and high expression of YY1 and lncRNA
   Kcnq1ot1 was associated with poor patient survival. Then, ChIP and MSP
   assays were employed to explore interactions between YY1, lncRNA
   Kcnq1ot1, and PTEN gene. We obtained that YY1 upregulated lncRNA
   Kcnq1ot1, which mediated PTEN methylation via DNMT1, thus decreasing
   PTEN expression. Afterward, TNBC cells were examined for their viability
   using functional assays with the results displaying that overexpression
   of YY1 facilitated TNBC cell proliferation, invasion, and migration.
   Mechanistically, upregulated YY1 repressed tumor growth by inhibiting
   PTEN via upregulation of lncRNA Kcnq1ot1. Mouse models were also
   constructed, and the above effects of YY1, lncRNA Kcnq1ot1, and PTEN on
   TNBC were also established in vivo. Taken together, this study
   demonstrates that the silencing of YY1 exerted tumor-suppressive effects
   on TNBC by modulating lncRNA Kcnq1ot1/DNMT1/PTEN pathway, in support of
   further investigation into anti-tumor therapy for TNBC.}},

Abstract = {{Previously, it has been demonstrated that aging is associated with
   nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B)-mediated hypothalamic
   gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) decrease. The hypothalamus is one
   of the brain regions that are vulnerable to ischemia-reperfusion injury.
   However, it is unclear whether ischemia-reperfusion has an influence on
   the hypothalamic GnRH release. In the current study, GT1-7 cells, which
   are a cell line of hypothalamic GnRH neurons, were subjected to
   hypoxia-reoxygenation to mimic ischemia-reperfusion. The effect of
   hypoxia-reoxygenation on the hypothalamic GnRH release was investigated.
   It was found that GnRH secretion from GT1-7 cells was decreased under
   the hypoxia-reoxygenation condition. Mechanistic studies revealed that
   hypoxia-reoxygenation activated nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) via
   the protein kinase B (Akt)/forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) pathway,
   thereby inhibiting gnrh1 gene. The results of the current study
   suggested that hypoxia-reoxygenation injury may facilitate the
   hypothalamic programming of system aging through impairment of
   hypothalamic GnRH release.}},

Abstract = {{High vigor seeds have greater yield potential than those with low vigor;
   however, long-term storage leads to a decline in this trait. The
   objective of this study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs)
   for seed vigor-related traits under artificial aging conditions using a
   high-density genetic linkage map of wheat (Triticum aestivum) and mine
   the related candidate genes. A doubled haploid population, derived from
   a cross between Hanxuan 10xLumai 14, was used as the experimental
   material. Six controlled-environment treatments were set up, i.e. the
   seeds were aged for 0, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 h at a high temperature
   (48 degrees C) and under high humidity (relative humidity 100\%). Eight
   traits including seed germination percentage, germination energy,
   germination index, seedling length, root length, seedling weight, vigor
   index, and simple vigor index were measured. With the prolongation of
   artificial aging treatment, these traits showed a continuous downward
   trend and significant correlations were observed between most of them. A
   total of 49 additive QTLs for seed vigor-related traits were mapped onto
   12 chromosomes (1B, 2D, 3A, 3B, 3D, 4A, 4D, 5A, 5B, 5D, 6D, and 7A); and
   each one accounted for 6.01-17.18\% of the phenotypic variations.
   Twenty-five pairs of epistatic QTLs were detected on all chromosomes,
   except for 5D, 6A, and 7D, and each epistasis accounted for 7.35-26.06\%
   of the phenotypic variations. Three additive QTL hot spots were found on
   chromosomes 5A, 5B, and 5D, respectively. 13 QTLs, QGEe5B, QGIe5B,
   QSLc5B, QSLd5B, QSLf5B, QRLd5B, QRLe5B, QRLf5B, QVId5B, QVIe5B, QVIf5B,
   QSVId5B, and QSVIe5B, were located in the marker interval AX-94643729
   similar to AX-110529646 on 5B and the physical interval
   707,412,449-710,959,479 bp. Genes including TRAESCS5B01G564900,
   TRAESCS5B01G564200, TRAESCS5B01G562600, TraesCS5B02G562700,
   TRAESCS5B01G561300, TRAESCS5B01G561400, and TRAESCS5B01G562100, located
   in this marker interval, were found to be involved in regulating the
   processes of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, transcription, and cell
   division during the germination of aging seeds, thus they were viewed as
   candidate genes for seed viability-related traits. These findings
   provide the basis for the seed-based cloning and functional
   identification of related candidate genes for seed vigor.}},

Abstract = {{Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is an atomic targeted radiotherapy
   that shows fantastic suppression impact on locally intrusive threatening
   tumors. One key factor for effective BNCT is to aggregate an adequate
   concentration (>20 ppm) of B-10 in the cytoplasm of the tumor.
   Carborane-loaded polymer nanoparticles are promising because of their
   outstanding biocompatibility and plasma steadiness. In this study, a new
   class of carborane-loaded nanoscale covalent organic polymers (BCOPs)
   was prepared by a Schiff base condensation reaction, and their
   solubility was greatly improved in common solvents via alkyl chain
   engineering and size tailoring. The obtained BCOP-ST was further
   functionalized by biocompatible
   1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-{[}amino(polyethylene-
   glycol)2000] (DSPE-PEG, molecular weight 2000) to form stable
   aqueous-phase nanoparticles with a hydrodynamic diameter of around 100
   nm. After chelating with radioactive copper-64, DSPE-BCOP-ST was tracked
   by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and showed significant
   accumulation in the tumor. DSPE-BCOP-5T + neutron radiation showed
   remarkable tumor suppression in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice (murine breast
   cancer). No obvious physical tissue damage and abnormal behavior were
   observed, demonstrating that the boron delivery was successful and
   tumor-selective. To conclude, this study presents a theranostic
   COP-based platform with a well-defined composition, good
   biocompatibility, and satisfactory tumor accumulation, which is
   promising for PET imaging, drug delivery, and BNCT.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The effects of ethanolic extract of Diospyros kaki (EED) on diabetic
   cognitive impairment were investigated in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced
   mouse. After HFD was fed to mouse for 16 weeks, EED was administrated to
   mouse for 4 weeks. EED reduced fasting blood glucose level and improved
   cognitive and behavioral dysfunction. EED improved serum biomarkers
   related to lipid and liver damage better than positive control (PC). In
   addition, EED ameliorated impaired cholinergic system, increased
   oxidative stress as well as mitochondrial dysfunction compared with HFD
   group. In the molecular study, EED downregulated the phosphorylation of
   c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK), which phosphorylates the serine residue
   of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1pSer). Finally, various
   physiological compounds such as tannin-based ingredients were identified
   using UPLC-QTOF/MS2. These results suggest that EED can help improve
   cognitive impairment caused by HFD.
   Practical applications Recently, cognitive impairment caused by type 2
   diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has become a problem. T2DM, mainly derived from
   HFD, is characterized by hyperglycemia, which is associated with insulin
   resistance. In this study, EED not only improved hyperglycemia and
   insulin resistance, but also restored diabetes-related cognitive
   dysfunction in HFD-induced diabetic mice. Finally, the decrease in
   cholinergic and antioxidant systems related to cognitive impairment was
   recovered by consumption of EED via improvement of insulin signaling
   pathway. Therefore, this study suggests that persimmon (Diospyros kaki)
   containing diverse physiological compounds has potential and industrial
   value as a functional food material for cognitive improvement.}},

Abstract = {{Recognition of aspiring states from established countries is central to
   becoming a member state of the international system. Previous research
   suggests that great power recognition decisions regarding aspiring
   states rapidly converge toward either recognition or non-recognition,
   yet great power convergence has still not occurred in the case of Kosovo
   after more than ten years. Unilateral secessions typically remain wholly
   unrecognized, since they violate the norm of home state consent, yet
   Kosovo has now been recognized by more than 100 countries. Why do some
   countries extend recognition to unilateral secessions, and do so early,
   whereas others delay recognition or withhold it altogether? In the case
   of Kosovo, great power influence and contestation, rather than
   convergence, have played a key role in shaping recognition decisions. We
   argue that countries in the US sphere of influence, with strong economic
   and military ties, are more likely to recognize Kosovo and to do so
   relatively fast, whereas countries influenced by Russia are less likely
   to recognize Kosovo at all, or to do so only after an extended delay.
   However, great powers are not equal in influencing other states to adopt
   their preferred position, since the USA is more powerful than Russia and
   can benefit from working alongside allies within the Western-oriented
   world order. We estimate a non-proportional Cox model with new
   time-varying data on Kosovo recognition and provide evidence that US
   military ties influenced other countries in extending recognition to
   unilateral secession.}},

Abstract = {{The recent proliferation of resilience discourses invited critical
   inquiries into the concept and its ability to construct policy
   narratives of ``certainty.{''} Critical works have deconstructed and
   debated the instrumentalist notions of resilience as overly simplified,
   raised to the forefront questions of power, emphasised the linkages of
   the concept to dominant political and economic regimes, and underscored
   the absence of any real call for transformative action, hence leading to
   the reproduction of perpetuating crises over the long run. To explore
   the structure of the critical literature on resilience, we map the ways
   in which critical trajectories developed and travelled across thematic
   communities. We use bibliometric analysis to examine 49 years of
   resilience literature from international relations, geography, political
   ecology, and other social science disciplines that foremost focused on
   questions of power, inequality, and social justice. As a result, this
   paper delves into the composition of different types of critique
   mobilised in resilience scholarship and identifies the interdependencies
   between modes of critical thought and their degree of interdisciplinary
   connectivity.}},

Abstract = {{Cities in the USA and around the world have begun to take an active role
   in responding to climate change. A central requirement for effective
   urban climate strategies is the capacity to understand and measure how
   the climate is changing, the physical, environmental, and social impacts
   of the changes, and whether adaptation and resiliency policies and
   programs put in place in response are working. The objective of this
   paper is to review and assess how urban climate change and resiliency
   efforts can be measured and to define what might serve as meaningful
   indicator and monitoring protocols. The New York City Panel on Climate
   Change (NPCC) is used as a case study along with a reviews of the
   emerging literature of urban climate change indicators to analyze the
   requirements and processes needed for a successful urban climate
   resiliency indicator and monitoring (I and M) system. In the paper, the
   basic requirements of a proposed Urban Climate Resilience Indicators and
   Monitoring System are presented. A specific illustration of an I and M
   system for tracking the urban heat island highlights challenges as well
   as potential solutions embedded within such systems. Discussions how
   these protocols can be translated to other locales and settings, as well
   as the relationship to the US National Climate Assessment indicator
   process, are presented.}},

Abstract = {{When addressing environmental health-related questions, most often, only
   observational data are collected for ethical or practical reasons.
   However, the lack of randomized exposure often prevents the comparison
   of similar groups of exposed and unexposed units. This design barrier
   leads the environmental epidemiology field to mainly estimate
   associations between environmental exposures and health outcomes. A
   recently developed causal inference pipeline was developed to guide
   researchers interested in estimating the effects of plausible
   hypothetical interventions for policy recommendations. This article
   illustrates how this multistaged pipeline can help environmental
   epidemiologists reconstruct and analyze hypothetical randomized
   experiments by investigating whether an air pollution reduction
   intervention decreases the risk of multiple sclerosis relapses in Alsace
   region, France. The epidemiology literature reports conflicted findings
   on the relationship between air pollution and multiple sclerosis. Some
   studies found significant associations, whereas others did not. Two
   case-crossover studies reported significant associations between the
   risk of multiple sclerosis relapses and the exposure to air pollutants
   in the Alsace region. We use the same study population as these
   epidemiological studies to illustrate how appealing this causal
   inference approach is to estimate the effects of hypothetical, but
   plausible, environmental interventions.}},

   retrospective study}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{Background. Spinal fibroblastic and myofibroblastic tumors (FMTs) are
   extremely rare. Few studies have reported on the features and outcomes
   of this condition that affects the axial skeleton. We explored the
   clinical characteristics and factors affecting the prognosis of spinal
   FMTs.
   Methods. We retroactively assessed the survival of 51 patients with
   spinal FMTs who underwent surgical and adjuvant treatments in our center
   between April 2006 and September 2018. Factors affecting disease-free
   survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed using the
   Kaplan-Meier method. Variables with p value < 0.05 were subjected to
   multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards regression
   model. A two-sided P value < 0.05 was considered statistically
   significant.
   Results. The mean follow-up period was 50.8 +/- 35.6 months (Range
   4.2-172.6). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that the 5-year DFS was
   10\% (95\% CI {[}31.0942.56]) and the 5-year OS was 53\% (95\% CI
   {[}61.28-97.20]). Multivariate analysis showed that en bloc excision was
   associated with better DFS (HR 0.214, 0.011) and OS (HR 0.273, 0.043),
   radiotherapy negatively affected OS (HR 0.353, 0.033), and the
   recurrence and Ki-67 index <5\% significantly affected DFS (HR 3.008,
   0.008 and 2.754, 0.029).
   Conclusions. Spinal FMTs are rare. Surgery is the treatment of choice
   and en bloc excision is strongly recommended to improve outcomes.
   Disease recurrence and the Ki-67 marker are correlated with the
   progression of these tumors.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on optimization of the substrate feeding profile for
   enhanced production of ranibizumab, a recombinant therapeutic protein,

   spectroscopy, was deployed to monitor the production process and to
   estimate real-time biomass. A validated mechanistic model was employed
   to formulate a multiobjective optimization (MOO) problem. The substrate
   flow rate during the fed-batch phase (F) was taken as the decision
   variable for MOO. The Pareto front resulting from MOO revealed that for
   a minimum broth volume (V) of 1.96 L, a maximum of 58.8 g of total
   biomass (XV) could be generated. The total biomass obtained from the
   optimal substrate feeding profile was 20.6\% higher than the
   experimentally achieved total biomass. Enhanced productivity was
   achieved by the proposed MOO formulation, which facilitates the choice
   of any operating point from the Pareto front based on downstream
   expenses of the therapeutic product.}},

Abstract = {{Contents
   Sperm morphology and morphometry are considered parameters in fertility
   diagnosis. They are especially important in the case of species for
   which there is no standard with respect to morphometric sperm
   parameters. It is then crucial to apply the staining technique that has
   the least influence on the sperm structure and provides the most
   detailed image, so as to enable measurements. The aim of the research
   was to assess the morphometric parameters of rabbit sperm using silver
   nitrate staining. The staining process revealed a detailed image of the
   spermatozoon head and tail, thus enabling precise measurements. From
   these basic morphometric parameters, four additional shape indices
   characterizing the sperm head were calculated: ellipticity, elongation,
   roughness and regularity. These parameters more precisely characterize
   the shape of the sperm head. Silver nitrate staining can be used as an
   independent technique in assessment of sperm structure or to supplement
   routine diagnostics.}},

Abstract = {{DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX21 (also named nucleolar RNA helicase 2) is a
   nuclear autoantigen with undefined roles in cancer. To explore possible
   roles of autoimmune recognition in cancer immunity, we examined DDX21
   protein expression in colorectal cancer tissue and its association with
   patient clinical outcomes. Unbiased deep proteomic profiling of two
   independent colorectal cancer cohorts using mass spectrometry showed
   that DDX21 protein was significantly upregulated in cancer relative to
   benign mucosa. We then examined DDX21 protein expression in a validation
   group of 710 patients, 619 of whom with early stage and 91 with late
   stage colorectal cancers. DDX21 was detected mostly in the tumor cell
   nuclei, with high expression in some mitotic cells. High levels of DDX21
   protein were found in 28\% of stage I, 21\% of stage II, 30\% of stage
   III, and 32\% of stage IV colorectal cancer cases. DDX21 expression
   levels correlated with non-mucinous histology in early stage cancers but
   not with other clinicopathological features such as patient gender, age,
   tumor location, tumor grade, or mismatch repair status in any cancer
   stage. Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed that high DDX21 protein levels was
   associated with longer survival in patients with early stage colorectal
   cancer, especially longer disease-free survival in patients with
   microsatellite instability (MSI) cancers, but no such correlations were
   found for the microsatellite stable subtype or late stage colorectal
   cancer. Univariate and multivariate analyses also identified high DDX21
   protein expression as an independent favorable prognostic marker for
   early stage MSI colorectal cancer.}},

Title = {{Fate of glyphosate in wheat during milling and bread production}},

Abstract = {{Background and objectives: Glyphosate is an active ingredient in widely
   used herbicides; its residues have been observed in grain and
   grain-based foods. This work investigated the fate of glyphosate and its
   degradation product aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) in milling
   fractions of wheat and during the bread making process. Samples of wheat
   were pearled to obtain successive fractions representing outer kernel
   layers. Straight grade flour and bread were prepared from the two
   samples with the highest glyphosate concentration (2.1 and 2.8 mg/kg).
   Findings: All pearling and milling product fractions, dough, fermented
   dough, bread crust, and bread crumb were analyzed for glyphosate and
   AMPA using solvent extraction with derivatization and liquid
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Glyphosate was the only residue
   detected in samples. On average, the pearling experiment demonstrated
   that 50\% of the total glyphosate mass resided in the outer 17\% of the
   kernels. Similarly, 81\% of the total glyphosate mass in the wheat was
   associated with the bran, shorts, and feeds milling fractions. No
   changes in glyphosate concentration were observed during the preparation
   of dough, fermented dough, and bread.
   Conclusions: Milling provides the best opportunity for reducing exposure
   to glyphosate, as the baking process did not affect glyphosate residues.
   Concentrations in bread made from straight grade flour will be
   approximately 4x lower than that made from whole grain flour.
   Significance and novelty: The use of Canada Western Red Spring from
   commercial wheat shipments provide realistic glyphosate residue
   concentrations and also reflect the predominance of this type of wheat
   used in Canada and elsewhere for bread. Therefore, the outcomes from
   this study are particularly relevant for estimating consumers' dietary
   exposure.}},

Abstract = {{Leptodeira is one of the most widespread and taxonomically problematic
   snake taxa in the Americas. Here we describe a new species of Leptodeira
   from the Andes of southern Ecuador based on morphological and molecular
   data. The new species is geographically close and morphologically
   similar to L. ornata and L. larcorum, from which it can be distinguished
   by having smaller dorsal body blotches, a longer tail, and shorter
   spines on the hemipenial body. The shortest genetic distances between
   the new species and its congeners are 0.02 (16S), 0.05 (cytb), and 0.18
   (ND4). The new species is restricted to the Jubones River Basin in
   southern Ecuador, an area of endemism for other reptile species. Our
   phylogenetic analysis based on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence
   data also supports recognition of the names L. larcorum (restricted to
   Peru) for ``L. septentrionalis larcorum{''}, and L. ornata for
   populations of ``L. s. ornata{''} from central and eastern Panama,
   western Colombia, and western Ecuador. However, some samples of ``L. s.
   ornata{''} from Panama and Costa Rica, as well as the new species
   described herein, are not included within or more closely related to L.
   ornata, which is sister to the Glade (L. bakeri, L. ashmeadii).}},

Title = {{Emotional Reactivity and Regulation in Preschool-Age Children Who Do and
   Do Not Stutter: Evidence From Autonomic Nervous System Measures}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: This experimental cross-sectional research study examined the
   emotional reactivity and emotion regulation in preschool-age children
   who do (CWS) and do not stutter (CWNS) by assessing their
   psychophysiological response during rest and while viewing pictures from
   the International Affective Picture System (Lang et al., 2008).
   Method: Participants were 18 CWS (16 boys and two girls; mean age 4
   years, 5 months) and 18 age- and gender-matched CWNS. Participants'
   psychophysiological responses were measured during two baselines and two
   picture viewing conditions. Skin conductance level (SCL) and heart rate
   were measured to assess emotional reactivity. Respiratory sinus
   arrhythmia (RSA) was measured to assess emotional regulation.
   Participants' shyness and executive function were assessed via parent
   report and considered for their effects on participants'
   psychophysiological responses.
   Results: First, CWNS and CWS did not differ in their initial baseline
   SCL, heart rate, or RSA, but all participants had higher SCL and lower
   RSA in the second baseline, subsequent to the first challenge condition,
   compared to the first baseline. Second, during the challenge conditions,
   CWS did not differ from CWNS in their SCL, but showed a significantly
   higher heart rate than CWNS. Third, CWS exhibited a significantly lower
   RSA during the challenge conditions compared to CWNS. Lastly, the
   temperamental quality of shyness was associated with preschool-age
   children's SCL, such that participants who were rated higher in shyness
   had a higher SCL during the challenge conditions. Participants'
   executive function had a marginally significant effect on the RSA, such
   that the participants who had higher executive function composite scores
   exhibited lower RSA during the challenge conditions.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that CWS and CWNS did not differ in
   their emotional reactivity and emotional regulation abilities at rest.
   During challenge conditions, however, CWS tended to be more emotionally
   reactive, as indicated by a higher heart rate, and also employed more
   emotional regulation, indexed by a greater decrease in RSA, compared to
   CWNS. Preschool-age children's behavior is largely dominated by
   reactivity, but there is the emergence of regulation, which can help
   children adjust to various contextual demands. For CWS who are more
   emotionally reactive, regulatory skills may be particularly critical to
   their prognosis and treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Background Meat grilled with wood charcoal is the most popular meal in
   Central Asia, but little is known about the grillers' occupational
   exposure to fine particulate matter (PM) in fumes. Objectives The aim of
   this study was to provide a quantitative analysis of occupational
   exposure to fine PM in grillers in the workplace. Methods We assessed
   exposure to PM2.5 from barbecue fumes using SidePak AM520 in six popular
   cafes in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Grillers wore devices for 8 h of work shift
   for 7 days in each place. Within- and between-place variances of PM2.5
   mass concentrations were calculated using analysis of variance, and we
   also calculated the fold range of the 95\% variance within (R-w(0.95))
   and between places (R-b(0.95)), as well as exceedance (gamma) and the
   probability of overexposure (theta). Results Two modes of exposure were
   identified, including intermittent and continuous. The median of daily
   geometric mean PM2.5 concentrations was 0.143 (interquartile range
   (IQR): 0.213) and 0.404 (IQR: 0.243) mg/m(3), accordingly. R-b(0.95) was
   very large (20.2), but R-w(0.95) was even greater (47.8), illustrating
   extremely high fluctuations in PM2.5 concentrations; gamma was 0.116,
   and theta was 0.095. Significance Very high occupational exposure to
   barbecue fumes in grillers is overlooked and likely causes elevated
   health risks.}},

Abstract = {{Microcolonial black fungi are a group of ascomycetes that exhibit high
   stress tolerance, yeast-like growth and constitutive melanin formation.
   They dominate a range of hostile natural and man-made environments, from
   desert rocks and salterns to dishwashers, roofs and solar panels. Due to
   their slow growth and a lack of genetic tools, the underlying mechanisms
   of black fungi's phenotypic traits have remained largely unexplored. We
   chose to address this gap by genetically engineering the rock-inhabiting
   fungus Knufia petricola (Eurotiomycetes, Chaetothyriales), a species
   that exhibits all characteristics of black fungi. A cell biological
   approach was taken by generating K. petricola strains expressing green
   or red fluorescent protein variants. By applying: (1) traditional gene
   replacement; (2) gene editing and replacement via plasmid-based or
   ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-based CRISPR/Cas9, and (3) silencing by RNA
   interference (RNAi), we constructed mutants in the pathways leading to
   melanin, carotenoids, uracil and adenine. Stable single and double
   mutants were generated with homologous recombination (HR) rates up to
   100\%. Efficient, partially cloning-free strategies to mutate multiple
   genes with or without resistance cassettes were developed. This
   state-of-the-art genetic toolkit, together with the annotated genome
   sequence of strain A95, firmly established K. petricola as a model for
   exploring microcolonial black fungi.}},

Abstract = {{Urchin-type cobalt phosphide microparticles assembled by nanorod were
   encapsulated in a graphene framework membrane (CoP@GF), and used as a
   binder-free electrode for alkali metal ion batteries. Electrochemical
   measurements indicate that this membrane exhibits enhanced reversible
   lithium, sodium, and potassium storage capabilities. Moreover, the
   energy storage properties of CoP@GF electrodes in alkali metal ion
   batteries display an order of Li>Na>K. DFT calculations on adsorption
   energy of CoP surfaces for Li, Na, and K indicated that CoP surfaces
   were more favorable to transfer electrons to Li atoms than Na and K, and
   the surface reactivity can be ordered as Li-CoP>Na-CoP>K-CoP; thus,
   CoP@GF exhibits better storage capacity for lithium. This work provides
   experimental and theoretical basis for understanding the electrochemical

Title = {{An Immune Gene-Related Five-lncRNA Signature for to Predict Glioma
   Prognosis}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN GENETICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{Background
   The tumor immune microenvironment is closely related to the malignant
   progression and treatment resistance of glioma. Long non-coding RNA
   (lncRNA) plays a regulatory role in this process. We investigated the
   pathological mechanisms within the glioma microenvironment and potential
   immunotherapy resistance related to lncRNAs.
   Method
   We downloaded datasets derived from glioma patients and analyzed them by
   hierarchical clustering. Next, we analyzed the immune microenvironment
   of glioma, related gene expression, and patient survival. Coexpressed
   lncRNAs were analyzed to generate a model of lncRNAs and immune-related
   genes. We analyzed the model using survival and Cox regression. Then,
   univariate, multivariate, receiver operating characteristic (ROC), and
   principle component analysis (PCA) methods were used to verify the
   accuracy of the model. Finally, GSEA was used to evaluate which
   functions and pathways were associated with the differential genes.
   Results
   Normal brain tissue maintains a low-medium immune state, and gliomas are
   clearly divided into three groups (low to high immunity). The stromal,
   immune, and estimate scores increased along with immunity, while tumor
   purity decreased. Further, human leukocyte antigen (HLA), programmed
   cell death-1 (PDL1), T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (TIM-3),
   B7-H3, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA4)
   expression increases concomitantly with immune state, and the patient
   prognosis worsens. Five immune gene-related lncRNAs (AP001007.1,
   LBX-AS1, MIR155HG, MAPT-AS1, and LINC00515) were screened to construct
   risk models. We found that risk scores are related to patient prognosis
   and clinical characteristics, and are positively correlated with PDL1,
   TIM-3, and B7-H3 expression. These lncRNAs may regulate the tumor immune
   microenvironment through cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions,
   complement, and coagulation cascades, and may promote CD8 + T cell,
   regulatory T cell, M1 macrophage, and infiltrating neutrophils activity
   in the high-immunity group. In vitro, the abnormal expression of
   immune-related lncRNAs and the relationship between risk scores and
   immune-related indicators (PDL1, CTLA4, CD3, CD8, iNOS) were verified by
   q-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC).
   Conclusion
   For the first time, we constructed immune gene-related lncRNA risk
   models. The risk score may be a new biomarker for tumor immune subtypes
   and provide molecular targets for glioma immunotherapy.}},

Abstract = {{Kiwifruit (Actinidia spp.) is native to China. Viral disease-like
   symptoms are common on kiwifruit plants. In this study, six libraries
   prepared from total RNA of leaf samples from 69 kiwifruit plants were
   subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS). Actinidia virus 1
   (AcV-1), a tentative species in the family Closteroviridae, was
   discovered in the six libraries. Two full-length and two near-full
   genome sequences of AcV-1 variants were determined by Sanger sequencing.
   The genome structure of these Chinese AcV-1 variants was identical to
   that of isolate K75 and consisted of 12 open reading frames (ORFs).
   Analyses of these sequences together with the NGS-derived contig
   sequences revealed high molecular diversity in AcV-1 populations, with
   the highest sequence variation occurring at ORF1a, ORF2, and ORF3, and
   the available variants clustered into three phylogenetic clades. For the
   first time, our study revealed different domain compositions in the
   viral ORF1a and molecular recombination events among AcV-1 variants.
   Specific reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays
   disclosed the presence of AcV-1 in plants of four kiwifruit species and
   unknown Actinidia spp. in seven provinces and one city.}},

Title = {{The role of sport-based social networks in the management of long-term
   health conditions: Insights from the World Transplant Games}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL REVIEW FOR THE SOCIOLOGY OF SPORT}},
Abstract = {{In the context of an increasing clinical need to better support
   self-managemt for people living with long-term health conditions an
   interest in the role of social networks has emerged. Given that sport
   participation often provides opportunities for social engagement, a
   space to explore Self-managemt at the intersection of medical sociology
   and the sociology of sport has opened up. This article presents findings
   from an exploratory qualitative study with organ transplant recipients
   who have participated in Transplant Games events - national and
   international multi-sport competitions for organ transplant recipients.
   Our findings illustrate how sport-based Social networks serve as
   resources for health-related knowledge, provide participants with
   additional affective support and help shape health expectations for the
   future. Although sport-based Social networks were seen as an
   overwhelmingly positive resource for our participants, it is plausible
   that harmful unintended consequences could arise for patients with
   existing Self-managemt issues. As such, it is recommended that people
   seeking to use sport as a tool to enhance illness Self-managemt should
   consider the various and powerful ways that Social networks can be
   impactful and anticipate the potential consequences accordingly.}},

Abstract = {{COVID-19 outbreak has significantly changed all aspects of general
   practice in Europe. This article focuses on the academic challenges for
   the discipline, mainly in the field of education, research, and quality
   assurance. The efforts of the European Region of the World Organisation
   of National Colleges, Academies, and Academic Associations of General
   Practitioners/Family Physicians (WONCA Europe) to support academic
   sustainability of the discipline in the time of pandemic are presented.
   Medical education was affected by the pandemic, threatening both its
   productivity and quality. Emerging new educational methods might be
   promising, but the results of their rapid implementation remain
   uncertain. A relatively small number of publications related to COVID-19
   and general practice is available in the medical literature. There is a
   shortage of original data from general practice settings. This contrasts
   with the crucial role of GPs in fighting a pandemic. COVID-19 outbreak
   has opened widely new research areas, which should be explored by GPs.
   Maintaining the quality of care and safety of all patients during the
   COVID-19 pandemic is the utmost priority. Many of them suffer from poor
   access or inadequate management of their problems. Rapid implementation
   of telemedicine brought both threats and opportunities. The COVID-19
   pandemic also challenged doctors' safety and well-being. These aspects
   will require discussion and remedy to prevent deterioration of the
   quality of primary care. WONCA Europe is making a multi-faceted effort
   to support GPs in difficult times of the pandemic. It is ready to
   support future efforts to uphold the integrity of family medicine as an
   academic discipline.}},

Journal = {{EDUCATIONAL MANAGEMENT ADMINISTRATION \& LEADERSHIP}},
Abstract = {{Educational leadership is essential to implement information and

   role that supports teachers to implement information and communications

   perspective to leadership and investigates aspects of information and
   communications technologies coordinator context that would facilitate
   leadership. Twenty-seven information and communications technologies
   coordinators were surveyed on their schools' structures and mechanisms
   that mediate their leadership practice. Descriptive statistics show that
   a wide range of structures and mechanisms in different quantities and
   with different qualities can be available to coordinators. The majority
   of coordinators have neither additional position roles nor a teaching
   load, but the coordinators have organizational unit assignments and
   attend daily, routine interactions. A case study illustrates how
   specific structures and mechanisms would facilitate leadership for
   information and communications technologies implementation. It is
   recommended to design an information and communications technologies
   coordinator role as a formal position role, for a school to employ more
   than one information and communications technologies coordinator, and to
   develop an information and communications technologies coordinator's
   teaching load, organizational unit assignments and routine interactions

Abstract = {{The specific impact of ecological environment quality at a regional
   scale due to the rubber plantations expansion is still unclear in
   Xishuangbanna, Yunnan province, China. First, we used a pixel and
   phenology-based multiple normalization approach to map rubber

   high-quality Landsat imagery. Second, a pixel-based optimized algorithm
   was developed to reduce the commission and omission errors of the rubber
   plantations maps and we mapped the rubber plantations expansion area.
   Third, a remote sensing-based ecological index (RSEI) was employed to
   assess the rubber plantations expansion area ecological environment
   quality. RSEI value decreased with the lowest value in 2007 (0.511) and
   increased with the highest value in 2016 (0.727). This study
   demonstrated that the ecological environment quality degraded from 1995

Title = {{Functional skeletal muscle constructs from transdifferentiated human

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{Transdifferentiation of human non-muscle cells directly into myogenic
   cells by forced expression of MyoD represents one route to obtain highly
   desirable human myogenic cells. However, functional properties of the
   tissue constructs derived from these transdifferentiated cells have been
   rarely studied. Here, we report that three-dimensional (3D) tissue
   constructs engineered with iMyoD-hTERT-NHDFs, normal human dermal
   fibroblasts transduced with genes encoding human telomerase reverse
   transcriptase and doxycycline-inducible MyoD, generate detectable
   contractile forces in response to electrical stimuli upon MyoD
   expression. Withdrawal of doxycycline in the middle of 3D culture
   results in 3.05 and 2.28 times increases in twitch and tetanic forces,
   respectively, suggesting that temporally-controlled MyoD expression
   benefits functional myogenic differentiation of transdifferentiated
   myoblast-like cells. Treatment with CHIR99021, a Wnt activator, and
   DAPT, a Notch inhibitor, leads to further enhanced contractile forces.
   The ability of these abundant and potentially patient-specific and
   disease-specific cells to develop into functional skeletal muscle
   constructs makes them highly valuable for many applications, such as
   disease modeling.}},

Abstract = {{Taking two typical grain producing areas of southern (Dongting Lake
   Region) and northern China (Shandong Province) as examples, this study
   used fault tree analysis and parametric estimation to provide a
   comparative analysis for environmental risks of intensive arable land
   use. The results show that (1) in the risks of eutrophication, toxicity,
   soil structure, greenhouse effect and air pollution, the greenhouse
   effect was the most prominent with the highest discharge; (2) the
   Dongting Lake Region discharged less pollutants annually than did
   Shandong Province, while surpassing Shandong in cumulative pollutant
   discharge in 2007-2018; (3) the spatial distribution of environmental
   risk in the Dongting Lake Region was mostly concentrated in the northern
   area, whereas that in Shandong Province displayed a scattered pattern;
   (4) in the Dongting Lake Region, Yueyang, Changde, and Yiyang were high
   environmental risk cities in 2007-2018, whereas in Shandong Province,
   Zaozhuang, Heze, Liaocheng, and Dezhou exhibited higher comprehensive
   environmental risk indexes in 2007-2008, while Rizhao replaced them in
   2018. The results indicated that ago-production material use must be
   controlled, reasonable zoning for areas posing environmental risks must
   be employed and cities with high environmental risk must be dynamically
   monitored to prevent the intensification of environmental risks of
   arable land use.}},

Abstract = {{Aging is a fundamental and fascinating process. Anti-aging research
   tried to find the mysteries about the human lifespan. To investigate the
   longevity-extending role of caffeic acid phenethylester (CAPE) and
   reveal the possible regulation mechanism, the long-term cultivation
   under well-defined environments, real-time monitoring, and live imaging
   is highly desired. In this paper, a well-designed microfluidic device
   was proposed to analyze the anti-aging effect of CAPE in Caenorhabditis
   elegans. With the combined use of multiple functional units, including
   micro-pillar, worm responder, a branching network of distribution
   channels, and microchambers, the longitudinal measurements of the exact
   number of worms throughout the whole lifespans is possible. Meanwhile,
   the brief cooling function of temperature-controllable system can
   achieve temporary and repeated immobilization of nematodes for
   fluorescence imaging. Our research data showed that CAPE can increase
   the survival of worms under normal and stress condition, including heat
   stress and paraquat-induced oxidative stress. The further studies
   revealed the anti-aging mechanism of CAPE. This proposed strategy and
   device would be a useful platform to facilitate future anti-aging
   studies and the finding of new lead compounds.}},

Title = {{A Multiclass Detection System for Android Malicious Apps Based on Color
   Image Features}},
Journal = {{WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{The visual recognition of Android malicious applications (Apps) is
   mainly focused on the binary classification using grayscale images,
   while the multiclassification of malicious App families is rarely
   studied. If we can visualize the Android malicious Apps as color images,
   we will get more features than using grayscale images. In this paper, a
   method of color visualization for Android Apps is proposed and
   implemented. Based on this, combined with deep learning models, a
   multiclassifier for the Android malicious App families is implemented,
   which can classify 10 common malicious App families. In order to better
   understand the behavioral characteristics of malicious Apps, we conduct
   a comprehensive manual analysis for a large number of malicious Apps and
   summarize 1695 malicious behavior characteristics as customized
   features. Compared with the App classifier based on the grayscale
   visualization method, it is verified that the classifier using the color
   visualization method can achieve better classification results. We use
   four types of Android App features: classes.dex file, sets of class
   names, APIs, and customized features as input for App visualization.
   According to the experimental results, we find out that using the
   customized features as the color visualization input features can
   achieve the highest detection accuracy rate, which is 96\% in the ten
   malicious families.}},

Journal = {{ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{Rapid urbanization in China has led to an excessive urban expansion of
   built-up areas, which makes quantitative research on compact city
   important. We adopted density and the degree of mixed land use to
   measure the compactness of 160 Chinese cities. Spatial autocorrelation
   analysis was performed to identify spatial clustering patterns, and the
   relationships between compactness and five variables were explored
   through regression models. The result shows that in nearly half of the
   cases, the calculated values of two indices are less than the average.
   The high or low values of density and the degree of mixed land use tend
   to be spatially clustered. The hot spot regions of density and the
   degree of mixed land use lie mainly in the south of China, while the
   north present as cold spots or the insignificant regions. Urban
   compactness can be affected by multifaceted factors and the
   relationships between compactness and five variables are not consistent
   throughout the areas of analysis. The GWR model can identify this
   phenomenon and provides a better fit than the OLS model. This study
   proposed a new approach to measure the compactness, and the results of
   GWR analysis can conducive to appropriate policy-making based on
   different local conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Upregulation of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) helps tumor cells
   escape from immune surveillance, and therapeutic antibodies targeting
   PD-1/PD-L1 have shown better patient outcomes only in several types of
   malignancies. Recent studies suggest that the clinical efficacy of
   anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatments is associated with PD-L1 levels; however, the
   underlying mechanism of high PD-L1 protein levels in cancers is not well
   defined. Here, we report that the deubiquitinase OTUB1 positively
   regulates PD-L1 stability and mediates cancer immune responses through
   the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that OTUB1
   interacts with and removes K48-linked ubiquitin chains from the PD-L1
   intracellular domain in a manner dependent on its deubiquitinase
   activity to hinder the degradation of PD-L1 through the ERAD pathway.
   Functionally, depletion of OTUB1 markedly decreases PD-L1 abundance,
   reduces PD-1 protein binding to the tumor cell surface, and causes
   increased tumor cell sensitivity to human peripheral blood mononuclear
   cells (PBMCs)-mediated cytotoxicity. Meanwhile, OTUB1 ablation-induced
   PD-L1 destabilization facilitates more CD8(+) T cells infiltration and
   increases the level of IFN-gamma in serum to enhance antitumor immunity
   in mice, and the tumor growth suppression by OTUB1 silencing could be
   reversed by PD-L1 overexpression. Furthermore, we observe a significant
   correlation between PD-L1 abundance and OTUB1 expression in human breast
   carcinoma. Our study reveals OTUB1 as a deubiquitinating enzyme that
   influences cancer immunosuppression via regulation of PD-L1 stability
   and may be a potential therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy.}},

Title = {{Struggling for normality: experiences of patients with diabetic lower
   extremity amputations and post-amputation wounds in primary care}},
Journal = {{PRIMARY HEALTH CARE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{21}},
Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{Aim:
   To explore the experiences of patients living with diabetic lower
   extremity amputation (DLEA) and its post-amputation wound in primary
   care.
   Background:
   DLEA, including both minor and major amputation, is a life-altering
   condition that brings numerous challenges to an individual's life.
   Post-amputation physical wound healing is complicated and challenging
   because of wound dehiscence and prolonged healing times. Understanding
   patients' experiences after DLEA with a post-amputation wound will
   enable healthcare professionals to develop interventions to assist
   patients in physical healing and psychosocial recovery.
   Methods:
   This study employs a qualitative design using interpretative
   phenomenological analysis (IPA). A purposive maximum variation sample of
   nine patients who had had lower extremity amputations and
   post-amputation wound attributed to diabetes in the previous 12 months
   was recruited from a primary care setting in Singapore. Semi-structured
   audio recorded one-to-one interviews with a duration of 45-60 min each
   were conducted between September 2018 and January 2019. The interviews
   were transcribed verbatim and analysed using IPA.
   Findings:
   The essential meaning of the phenomenon `the lived experiences for
   patients with DLEA and post-amputated wound' can be interpreted as
   `struggling for ``normality{''}' which encompasses four domains of sense
   making: physical loss disrupted normality, emotional impact aggravated
   the disrupted normality, social challenges further provoked the
   disrupted normality, and attempt to regain normality. The study
   highlights the complex physical and psychosocial transition facing
   patients after DLEA before post-amputation wound closure. In primary
   care, an amputation, whether minor or major, is a life-altering
   experience that requires physical healing, emotional recovery, and
   social adaptation to regain normality. Patients living with DLEA and a
   post-amputation wound may benefit from an interdisciplinary team care
   model to assist them with physical and psychosocial adjustment and
   resume normality.}},

Abstract = {{Flexible sensors based on conductive hydrogel show great potential in
   electronic skin and human-machine interface. However, pure water in
   hydrogel inevitably freezes or rapidly evaporates under extreme
   temperatures, leading to inadequate fulfillment of sensor performances.
   Herein, a well-designed strategy is reported for fabricating extreme
   temperature-tolerant gel-based sensors. By immersing a
   gelatin/polyacrylamide (PAAm)-clay composite (GC) hydrogel into a
   ZnCl2/water/glycerol system, a phase-transition-tunable gel (PTTGC gel)
   is obtained with outstanding antifreezing (-82 degrees C) and
   long-lasting moisture (70 degrees C, more than 40 days) properties.
   Meanwhile, the gel also presents good antibacterial activity and
   biocompatibility attributing to Zn2+ and gelatin, respectively. Then, a
   dual-response sensor with a wide operating temperature (-60 to 60
   degrees C) is proposed, presenting high stress and temperature
   sensitivities and long-term stability. The sensor will meet the needs of
   the human-machine interface for scientific investigation and data
   monitoring in polar, desert, etc.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of the contamination of living organisms by actinide elements
   has been a constant subject of attention since the 1950s. But to date
   still little is understood. Ferritin is the major storage and regulation
   protein of iron in many organisms, it consists of a protein ring and a
   ferrihydric core at the center. This work sheds light on the
   interactions of early actinides (Th, Pu) at oxidation state +IV with
   ferritin and its ability to store those elements at physiological pH
   compared to Fe. The ferritin-thorium load curve suggests that Th-IV
   saturates the protein (2840 Th atoms per ferritin) in a similar way that
   Fe does on the protein ring. Complementary spectroscopic techniques
   (spectrophotometry, infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption
   spectroscopy) were combined with molecular dynamics to provide a
   structural model of the interaction of Th-IV and Pu-IV with ferritin.
   Comparison of spectroscopic data together with MD calculations suggests
   that Th-IV and Pu-IV are complexed mainly on the protein ring and not on
   the ferrihydric core. Indeed from XAS data, there is no evidence of Fe
   neighbors in the Th and Pu environments. On the other hand, carboxylates
   from amino acids of the protein ring and a possible additional carbonate
   anion are shaping the cation coordination spheres. This thorough
   description from a molecular view point of Th-IV and Pu-IV interaction
   with ferritin, an essential iron storage protein, is a cornerstone in
   comprehensive nuclear toxicology.}},

Title = {{Amelioration of testosterone-induced benign prostatic hyperplasia using
   febuxostat in rats: The role of VEGF/TGF beta and iNOS/COX-2}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{889}},

Abstract = {{Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common male disorder. Febuxostat
   is a non-purine, selective inhibitor of xanthine oxidase (XO), which has
   a strong antioxidant capacity and pleiotropic pharmacological
   properties. This study's objective was to explore the potential
   ameliorative effects of febuxostat against testosterone-induced BPH in
   rats. Febuxostat (10 mg/kg/day, per os {[}p.o.]) prevented increased
   prostate index levels, serum levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA),
   and testosterone levels compared to animals treated with testosterone
   alone, when administered for 28 days. Histological examination indicated
   that febuxostat dramatically ameliorated pathological changes in the
   prostate architecture compared to the testosterone group. Similarly,
   febuxostat markedly improved testosterone-induced oxidative stress by
   inhibiting the increase in lipid peroxide and nitrite content, and by
   reducing the level of depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH) and
   superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, which significantly reduced the
   prostate content of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis
   factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Furthermore,
   febuxostat significantly reduced the prostatic content, both in terms of
   inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)
   messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels, and of protein levels.
   Moreover, compared to the testosterone group, febuxostat's beneficial
   effects prevented the increase in growth factors, comprising vascular
   endothelial cell growth factor A (VEGF-A) and transforming growth factor
   beta (TGF-beta) protein levels. Its ameliorating effects were equal to
   those of finasteride, which is the most widely used remedy for BPH. In
   conclusion, this study provides novel evidence that febuxostat
   experimentally attenuates testosterone-induced BPH in rats, at least in
   part by inhibiting iNOS/COX-2 and VEGF/TGF-beta pathways.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines institutional activism between 2011 and 2018 in
   two Brazilian government programs, `Green Grants' and the `Stork
   Network'. Institutional activism is defined as collective action in the
   defense of contentious causes conducted within the boundaries of state
   institutions. The two policies were designed and implemented by
   bureaucrats committed to social movement causes, environmentalism and
   women's health, respectively. The environmentalist bureaucrats were
   mostly permanent public employees with few ties to movement networks,
   while the women's health group included mostly temporary employees with
   long histories of civil society activism. I argue that diverse locations
   in state institutions and movement networks gave these groups access to
   different combinations of institutional and relational resources. In
   dialogue with theories of situated agency and activist strategy, I show
   how those differences both led actors to engage in different kinds of
   strategies and influenced the way those strategies changed as political
   conditions became increasingly hostile.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose As exploratory research, this project aimed to develop and
   assess the effect of implementing a food waste reduction program at a
   restaurant on a university campus. Design/methodology/approach Data
   collection consisted of an audit of both pre and postconsumer food waste
   to determine the effectiveness of various reduction strategies and a
   survey to assess attitudes of employees toward food waste. As
   exploratory research, a personalized database was created to track
   current food waste amounts and reasons for waste in the restaurant
   operation to determine if the same method could be employed in future
   research. Findings Overall, the restaurant in this study implemented
   various effective food waste reduction practices that were inexpensive
   and simple, resulting in a weekly average reduction of 14.3 pounds of
   food waste. The top five food item products wasted by the kitchen were
   also identified for both pre and postintervention phases as well as the
   reasons for generating kitchen waste. Furthermore, data reported on
   postconsumer waste included weight quantities and product types.
   Originality/value The project resulted in evidence that a personalized
   food tracking system is useful for identifying and quantifying food
   waste in foodservice operations. Therefore, the research design and data
   collection methods used in this project can be used in future research
   on a larger scale.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed at investigating two strategies to enhance the
   bioaccessibility of phenolic compounds from whole-wheat breads:
   enzymatic bioprocessing and addition of green coffee infusion. Although
   both strategies had a significant effect on increasing the contents of
   total soluble phenolic compounds in breads, the addition of green coffee
   infusion was much more relevant (19.1-fold) than enzymatic bioprocessing
   (1.8-fold). The phenolic compounds present as soluble forms were
   completely released from all breads' matrix already at the oral phase of
   digestion. While gastric digestion did not promote the release of
   insoluble phenolic compounds, intestinal conditions led to a slight
   release. All bread samples showed maximum phenolic compounds
   bioaccessibility after 4 h of gut fermentation. Upon the end of in vitro
   digestion and gut fermentation, the difference between the strategies
   was that enzymatic bioprocessing accelerated ferulic acid release, while
   the addition of green coffee infusion increased 10.4-fold the overall
   phenolic compounds bioaccessibility.}},

Abstract = {{This overall study is about one hospital food system that supports meals
   for patients, retail customers, special events, and school catering. The
   estimated food prepared is 90\% for patients and retail. The goal is to
   quantify food purchase, consumption, and waste, as well as energy use in
   this food system. The input to the overall food system was estimated as
   a total of about 1200 food item codes per year (Sysco codes) which weigh
   about 1,200,000 lbs. Waste in the kitchen where food preparation and
   patient meals are handled consists of solids (peels, seeds, etc.) or
   liquids (pickle juice, canned fruit liquid, etc.), and fully prepared
   food kept warm but for which no patient requests are made and so are
   declared as leftover waste. The study addressed the food waste per tray
   and per patient and the retail waste (unused leftovers), which averages
   48,180 lbs/year. So, the actual hospital food waste is about three-fold
   higher than the patient tray waste, which is often the only studied
   aspect of the hospital food system. Thus this study provides a new
   perspective on hospital food waste as it measures food waste and energy
   use in the kitchen, patient, and retail areas for improvements.}},

Journal = {{LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{607}},

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to study some features of slice semi-regular
   functions S epsilon M(Omega) on a circular domain Omega contained in the
   skew-symmetric algebra of quaternions H via the analysis of a family of
   linear operators built from left and right {*}-multiplication on S
   epsilon M(Omega); this class of operators includes the family of
   Sylvester-type operators S-f,S-g. Our goal is achieved by a strategy
   based on a matrix interpretation of these operators as we show that S
   epsilon M(O) can be seen as a 4-dimensional vector space on the field S
   epsilon M-R(Omega). We then study the rank of S-f,S-g and describe its
   kernel and image when it is not invertible, finding meaningful
   differences in the cases when the rank is either 2or 3. By using these
   results, we are able to characterize when the functions fand gare either
   equivalent under {*}-conjugation or intertwined by means of a zero
   divisor, thus proving a number of statements on the behaviour of slice
   semi-regular functions. In this way, information aboutthe operator
   obtained by linear algebra techniques give as a significant application
   the solution of a problem in an area of function theory which had
   aremarkable development in the last decade (see{[}16]). We also provide
   a complete classification of idempotents and zero divisors on product

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BORDERLANDS STUDIES}},
Abstract = {{This paper uses Mexico's 2015 Inter-census Survey, the US's American
   Community Survey, and publicly available data on health, education, and
   the economy to update the Border Human Development Index (BHDI). The
   purpose of this index is to provide time series and cross sections of
   comparative measures of well-being in the states, counties and
   municipios that line the US-Mexico Border. For the time period spanned
   by the sample, 1990-2015, we find that both sides of the border have
   experienced steady gains in the BHDI at all regional levels. The largest
   gains are observed in border counties and municipios. During this 25
   year period, the BHDI for Mexican border municipios increased slightly
   more than US border counties, indicating a small narrowing of the
   development gap. A slightly smaller narrowing of the gap is also seen at
   the national level. Nonetheless, the gap in human development between
   the two countries, as well as US counties and Mexican municipios remains
   large, particularly in the area of education.}},

Abstract = {{Jean Monnet was the inventor of the community method; by placing
   economic integration before the political one, he reversed the criteria
   of unification that had characterised the development of nation-states

   this, he engaged on an equal footing with the most prestigious statesmen
   of the twentieth century, influencing their choices: from Viviani in
   1914 to Giscard d'Estaing in 1975, passing through Schuman, Spaak, De
   Gasperi, Adenauer and Kennedy. Monnet favoured the creation of
   supranational community institutions. Through his foresight he was able
   to combine ideas and pragmatism and in this way he taught a whole
   generation of European leaders to debate issues of common interest, thus
   overcoming national selfishness; from the Schuman Declaration of which
   he was the main `inspirer' (as he was sarcastically called by Charles de
   Gaulle) which led to the European Coal and Steel Community (1951) to the
   first election by universal suffrage of the European Parliament (1979),
   passing through the failure of the European Defence Community (1954),
   the Rome Treaties establishing the European Economic Community and

Title = {{Geochemical evolution of the lithospheric mantle beneath the Styrian
   Basin (Western Pannonian Basin)}},
Journal = {{LITHOS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{378}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The Styrian Basin is located at the westernmost part of the
   Carpathian-Pannonian region, in the transition zone between the
   Pannonian Basin and the Eastern Alps. The lithospheric mantle beneath
   the Styrian Basin (SB) was sampled by Plio-Pleistocene alkali basalts,
   which brought mantle xenoliths to the surface. Mantle xenoliths from the
   SB are mostly coarse granular, amphibole-bearing spinel
   lherzoliteswithmicrostructures indicating extensive annealing. Three
   geochemical events were recorded in the SB xenoliths. The initial,
   ancient partial melting event was followed by an old metasomatism, which
   formed lithological heterogeneities (e.g. websterite, dunite) occurring
   as veins, bands and layers. The most recent geochemical event recorded
   in the SB xenoliths is the migration of a hydrous alkaline melt
   originating from a nephelinitic melt source. This melt migrated from the
   asthenosphere, forming melt channels in the lithospheric mantle. Close
   to the channels, the metasomatic agent caused extensive amphibole and
   sparse phlogopite formation. This particular pargasite-phlogopite
   equilibrium mineral assemblage in the spinel facies was not described
   before in the literature based on our knowledge. The reaction caused
   significant enrichment in basaltic elements (such as Ti, Fe), K, light
   rare earth elements and incompatible trace elements such as Zr and Hf.
   Further fromthe channels, the metasomaticmelt became enriched in
   volatiles (mainly H2O and CO2) and fluidmobile elements (e.g. U, Pb, Cl
   and P), but depleted in basaltic elements, K and LREE, which resulted in
   modal decrease of amphiboles. Previous studies suggested a dehydrating
   subducted slab beneath the Styrian Basin, however geochemical
   fingerprints of subducted slab derived fluidswere recognized only in one
   xenolith. Mantle portionswith different geochemical characteristics
   developed in the lithosphere laterally, however metasomatic fingerprints
   were erased later due to annealing and chemical re-equilibration at
   ambient mantle conditions. The Neogene evolution of the lithosphere
   overwrote the previous state of the upper mantle beneath the region,
   thus the signs of the most recent metasomatism by nephelinitic melts
   could have been only preserved due to this extensive annealing event.

Abstract = {{Aim: To assess the efficacy of rectally administered misoprostol in the
   improvement of bowel function recovery after cesarean delivery (CD).
   Methods: This prospective randomized trial was conducted among 171
   pregnant women subjected to term elective CD. Patients were divided
   equally into 3 groups by simple randomization. Participants in group A
   were given misoprostol 200 mu g rectally; those in group B were given
   misoprostol 400 mu g rectally just after CD but before leaving the
   operating theater, while the participants in group C did not receive any
   rectal drug. The study outcome measures were: duration before first
   bowel movement and start of the regular oral diet. Adverse effects, need
   for additional analgesics, and post-CD hospital stay period were also
   recorded. Results: The mean times to first audible intestinal sounds and
   to the first passage of flatus were significantly lower in group B (14.1
   +/- 1.4 h and 16.7 +/- 2.3 h, respectively) when compared to both groups
   A and C {[} 21.9 +/- 5.3 h and 24.9 +/- 5.7 h (A) vs. 23.6 +/- 6.9 h and
   27.1 +/- 7.9 h (C)] (p = 0.001). It was found that notably, patients in
   group B resumed diet more quickly, with a mean period of 20.5 h, which
   was significantly faster than the remaining groups (29.8 h and 33.1 h in
   groups A and C, respectively Of great interest, patients in group B had
   a lower post-CD hospital stay (38.5 h vs. 59.2 h in group A and 64. 8 h
   in group C). Conclusion: For the recovery of bowel functions after CD,
   rectal administration of 400 mu g misoprostol appears to be more
   effective than 200 mu g of rectally administrated misoprostol or
   traditional feeding regimens.}},

Title = {{Is the thermal transmittance of air-filled inclined multi-glazing
   windows similar to that of vertical ones?}},
Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{229}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{By focusing on the effect of inclination angle on the thermal
   transmittance of glazing systems, this paper investigates the flow
   structure and heat transfer of air-filled uncoated multi glazed windows
   since the design of inclined windows are mostly considered as vertical
   ones in the construction sector. Revealing the influences of tilt angle
   on the energy saving performance of these type of window units is one of
   the main objectives of this study in which the examined parameters are
   not limited to inclination angle, which is considered from theta = 0 to
   90 degrees, but also includes air layer thickness ranging from L = 6 to
   18 mm and number of panes (namely, double, triple and quadruple pane
   window units, without considering the window frames and edge seals). The
   outcomes of the computations are presented by streamline and isotherm
   contours which give a solid opinion about the flow and heat transfer
   inside the gap of the glazed windows, and also U-values which provide a
   quantitative understanding. The results showed that the air layer
   thickness optimized for vertical glazing units can be considered for
   inclined installation on condition that theta >= 45 degrees. However, at
   lower inclination angles the air layer thickness should be optimized
   considering the inclination angle and number of panes as increasing the
   layer thickness above L > 9 mm may increase the thermal transmittance of
   glazing unit. The risk of increasing U-value with larger air layer
   applied to inclined surface reduces by using more panes. (C) 2020

Title = {{Reservoir trophic state confounds flow-ecology relationships in
   regulated streams}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{748}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Cultural eutrophication and river regulation have been identified as two
   of the most pressing threats to global freshwater biodiversity. However,
   we know little about their combined ecological effects, raising
   questions over biomonitoring practices that typically consider such
   stressors in isolation. To address this inconsistency, we examined a
   decade-long dataset of macroinvertebrate samples and environmental data
   collected downstream of three reservoirs spanning a broad gradient of
   trophic states, from mesotrophic to hypereutrophic. We analysed the
   responses of routine macroinvertebrate biomonitoring indices and
   community composition to antecedent flow, temperature and water quality,
   including parameters associated with eutrophication (total phosphorous,
   nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, chlorophyll a). Multi-model comparisons of
   linear regressor combinations, variation partitioning and distance-based
   redundancy analyses all revealed shifts in the relative significance of
   flow and water quality predictors across the trophic state gradient. At
   the mesotrophic site biomonitoring indices and community composition
   were most sensitive to seasonal flow variability- particularly high-flow
   conditions- whereas in the hypereutrophic system stronger associations
   with nutrient concentrations emerged, notably nitrite and nitrate.
   Patterns at the eutrophic site were broadly intermediate between these,
   with significant biotic responses to antecedent flows mediated by water
   quality. Based on these results we suggest that nutrient regimes should
   be regarded as an integral component of environmental flows science. We
   therefore call on practitioners to look beyond the stressor-specific
   indices widely used to assess ecological status in rivers to consider
   the interactive effects of flow and water quality. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Title = {{Microstructural characterization, mechanical property and corrosion
   behavior of VNbMoTaWAl refractory high entropy alloy coatings: Effect of
   Al content}},
Journal = {{SURFACE \& COATINGS TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{403}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Recently, the refractory high entropy alloy coatings have drawn lots of
   attention due to their high temperature strength and stable thermal
   properties. In this study, the VNbMoTaW and three Al contained
   VNbMoTaWAl refractory high entropy alloy coatings were fabricated using
   a pulsed direct current magnetron co-sputtering system. Al addition into
   the VNbMoTaW coatings was chosen for this study since Al is an important
   material known for its lightweight. The BCC phase of the VNbMoTaWAl
   coating was kept as 8.54 at.\% Al was added. The surface roughness,
   grain size and density of VNbMoTaW and VNbMoTaWAl coatings decreased
   with increasing Al content. The addition of Al element into VNbMoTaW
   coating can increase its hardness up to 18.1 GPa due to the solution
   hardening effect. The corrosion resistance of the 304 stainless steel
   substrate in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution was improved by the refractory
   VNbMoTaW and VNbMoTaWAl coatings. Furthermore, the best corrosion
   resistance of VNbMoTaWAl coatings was obtained by the addition of 2.37
   at.\% Al. The equivalent circuit of the VNbMoTaWAl coatings in 0.5 M
   H(2)SO(4 )solution was also proposed. However, the oxygen contamination
   in excess of 3 at.\% in the VNbMoTaWAl coatings had detrimental effects
   on the mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of the coatings
   due to formation of oxide phases.}},

Abstract = {{The current study aims to check various behavioural, developmental,
   cytotoxic, and genotoxic effects of Fe3O4-GG nanocomposite (GGNCs) on
   Drosophila melanogaster. Fe3O4 nanoparticles were prepared by the
   chemical co-precipitation method and cross-linked with guargum
   nanoparticles to prepare the nanocomposites. The nanocomposites were
   characterized by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), and FTIR techniques. To investigate the biomolecular
   interaction, GGNCs was further tagged with Fluorescein isothiocyanate.
   Various concentrations of nanocomposites were mixed with the food and
   flies were allowed to complete the life cycle. The life cycle of the
   flies was studied as a function of various concentrations of GGNCs. The
   1st instar larvae after hatching from the egg start eating the food
   mixed with GGNCs. The 3rd instar larvae were investigated for various
   behavioural and morphological abnormalities within the gut. The 3rd
   instar larva has defective crawling speed, crawling path, and more
   number of micronuclei within the gut. Similarly, in adult flies thermal
   sensitivity, climbing behaviour was found to be altered. In adult flies,
   a significant reduction in body weight was found which is further
   correlated with variation of protein, carbohydrate, triglyceride, and
   antioxidant enzymes. Altogether, the current study suggests GGNCs as a
   non-genotoxic nanoparticle for various biological applications. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{Molecular architecture plays a key role in the self-assembly of block
   copolymers, but few studies have systematically examined the influence
   of chain connectivity on tetrahedrally close-packed (TCP) sphere phases.
   Here, we report a versatile material platform comprising two blocks with
   substantial conformational asymmetry, A = poly(trifluoroethyl acrylate)
   and B = poly(dodecyl acrylate), and use it to compare the phase behavior
   of AB diblocks, ABA triblocks, and (AB)(n) radial star copolymers with n
   = 3 or 4. Each architecture forms TCP sphere phases at minority A block
   compositions (f(A) < 0.5), namely, sigma and AlS, but with differences
   in the location of order-order phase boundaries that are not anticipated
   by mean-field self-consistent field theory simulations. These results
   expand the palette of polymer architectures that readily self-assemble
   into complex TCP structures and suggest important design considerations
   when targeting specific phases of interest.}},

Title = {{Anti-VEGF-therapy of fibrovascular and serous-vascularized pigment
   epithelial detachment in neovascular AMD A retrospective
   five-year-analysis}},
Journal = {{OPHTHALMOLOGE}},
Abstract = {{Background Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) is the
   most frequent cause of pigment epithelial detachment (PED). In the
   clinical routine the treatment of fibrovascular PED (fPED) and serous
   vascularized PED (svPED) with intravitreal vascular endothelial growth
   factor (VEGF) inhibitors has a restricted prognosis. Objective There are
   limited data on the long-term outcome of PED under anti-VEGF therapy.
   Therefore, this study recorded the course of treated PEDs in nAMD eyes
   over a period of 5 years. Methods All eyes with fPED or svPED that
   underwent anti-VEGF medication between 2006 and 2015 were
   retrospectively analyzed regarding the clinical course and the
   morphology seen on optical coherence tomography (OCT). The inclusion
   criteria were the detection of a PED on OCT, the angiographic
   verification of nAMD, a documented clinical history over 5 years and a
   good image quality. Results A total of 23 eyes from 22 patients met the
   inclusion criteria. After 5 years a significant deterioration of visual
   acuity (VA) was seen in all eyes (p = 0.007) and in the subgroup of
   cases with fPED (p = 0.045). In the eyes with svPED the decline of VA
   was not significant (p = 0.097). In the collective study group a
   statistically significant reduction of PED height (p = 0.006) and an
   increase of PED diameter was measured (p = 0.002). In the subgroup
   analysis the decrease of PED height and increase of PED diameter were
   significant for cases with svPED (p = 0.004, p = 0.013, respectively)
   but were not statistically significant for fPED eyes (height: p = 0.616;
   diameter: p = 0.097). In 17 (74\%) eyes fibrosis or atrophy were seen on
   the final assessment of OCT images. Discussion After 5 years of
   anti-VEGF therapy for nAMD-associated PED the VA declined in half of the
   eyes and the OCT showed an unfavorable morphology in 3/4 of the cases.
   The average number of visits and injections was distinctly lower than in
   clinical trials and other real-life analyses. In summary, we observed an
   undertreatment with a worse functional and anatomical outcome in our
   clinical routine compared to other studies.}},

Title = {{A binary social spider algorithm for uncapacitated facility location
   problem}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{161}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{In order to find efficient solutions to real complex world problems,
   computer sciences and especially heuristic algorithms are often used.
   Heuristic algorithms can give optimal solutions for large scale
   optimization problems in an acceptable period. Social Spider Algorithm
   (SSA), which is a heuristic algorithm created on spider behaviors are
   studied. The original study of this algorithm was proposed to solve
   continuous problems. In this paper, the binary version of the Social
   Spider Algorithm called Binary Social Spider Algorithm (BinSSA) is
   proposed for binary optimization problems. BinSSA is obtained from SSA,
   by transforming constant search space to binary search space with four
   transfer functions. Thus, BinSSA variations are created as BinSSA1,
   BinSSA2, BinSSA3, and BinSSA4. The study steps of the original SSA are
   re-updated for BinSSA. A random walking schema in SSA is replaced by a
   candidate solution schema in BinSSA. Two new methods (similarity measure
   and logic gate) are used in candidate solution production schema for
   increasing the exploration and exploitation capacity of BinSSA. The
   performance of both techniques on BinSSA is examined. BinSSA is named as
   BinSSA(Sim\&Logic). Local search and global search performance of BinSSA
   is increased by these two methods. Three different studies are performed
   with BinSSA. In the first study, the performance of BinSSA is tested on
   the classic eighteen unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions. Thus,
   the best variation of BinSSA and BinSSA (Sim\&Logic) is determined as
   BinSSA4(Sim\&Logic). BinSSA4(Sim\&Logic) has been compared with other
   heuristic algorithms on CEC2005 and CEC2015 functions. In the second
   study, the uncapacitated facility location problems (UFLPs) are solved
   with BinSSA(Sim\&Logic). UFL problems are one of the pure binary
   optimization problems. BinSSA is tested on low-scaled, middle-scaled,
   and large-scaled fifteen UFLP samples and obtained results are compared
   with eighteen state-of-art algorithms. In the third study, we solved UFL
   problems on a different dataset named M{*} with BinSSA(Sim\&Logic). The
   results of BinSSA (Sim\&Logic) are compared with the Local Search (LS),
   Tabu Search (TS), and Improved Scatter Search (ISS) algorithms. Obtained
   results have shown that BinSSA offers quality and stable solutions. (c)

Abstract = {{A fiber Bragg grating (FBG) accelerometer suitable for health monitoring
   of electrical machines has been proposed. A polymer composite material
   is used to design the cantilever of the accelerometer. Thus it is
   ensured that there are no conducting parts in the accelerometer.
   Detailed finite element analysis of the cantilever is done to optimize
   the sensitivity and the resonant frequency. The sensitivity is
   significantly improved compared to the conventional FBG accelerometer
   having similar bandwidth of operation. Two different configurations, one
   having sensitivity 14.4 pm/g with resonant frequency 444 Hz, and the
   other having sensitivity 7.5 pm/g with resonant frequency 940 Hz have
   been designed and fabricated. The wide band optical accelerometers will
   enable monitoring of vibration modes of critical components of
   electrical machines and more importantly using commercially available
   standard FBG interrogators, instead of using any complex interrogation
   techniques. A good match between the simulation and experimental results
   was observed.}},

   deltas}},
Journal = {{PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{560}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{We examine the nature and number of event beds preserved in heterolithic
   prodelta and delta-front strata in five proximal-accumulation-dominated
   (PAD) North American delta systems including the Quaternary Gulf of
   Mexico and the Late Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway. We also explore
   the continuum between PAD, more distal deposits of mud belts, and
   thicker subaqueous-delta-clinoforms (SDC). Sediment accumulation rates
   in modern PAD and SDC systems are commonly on the order of several to
   severaltens of centimeters per year. They also show that several event
   beds may be created annually, with preservation depending on supply and
   reworking. The PAD heterolithics commonly comprise interbedded sand,
   silt and clay. These show normal and inverse grading and Bouma
   sequences, indicating deposition from turbidity currents and hyperpycnal
   flows that are interpreted as the products of river plumes generated
   during flood episodes. Re-equilibrated Rosselia socialis in stacked
   delta front turbidite bedsets in the Cretaceous examples show that
   floods may occur as a cluster of events over several months. Shelf areas
   adjacent to river mouths may experience high rates of sediment delivery
   from rivers, but oceanographic processes are instrumental in moving much
   of the silt and clay farther along the shelf. Direct, hyperpycnal
   delivery from a river mouth on a low gradient shelf (i.e.,
   typically<0.05 degrees) is rare, owing to the difficulty of maintaining
   a high suspended sediment concentration, but sedimentation rates are
   nevertheless high. Shelf facies show evidence for extensive and frequent
   remobilization during storms and other meteorological events.
   Storm-wave-enhanced sediment-gravity flows (WESGFS) may form under
   favorable conditions, such as strong waves, high suspended sediments,
   and convergent currents, and can be significant in building SDC and
   other shelf deposits. The proximal portions of PAD and SDC systems
   typically show low intensity and diversity of bioturbation (BI 0-1). The
   bioturbation styles encountered in these deposits record: 1) high
   sedimentation rates, which preclude wholesale biogenic reworking; 2)
   high-frequency river floods and storm reworking, expressed by reduced
   colonization windows; 3) soupy substrates, likely reflecting formation
   of a permanent fluid-mud lutocline; and 4) elevated turbidity near the
   sediment-water interface, which may cause further suppression of
   trace-making.}},

   support scale was conducted on a sample of 252 university students and
   278 community samples. Findings indicated that the 4-factor model fit
   the data well and support construct validity. Results also provided
   preliminary support for convergent validity. Low correlations (.21
   to.45) between two-way social support sub-scales and altruism scale
   suggested the existence of divergent validity. Internal consistency
   reliability analyses revealed Cronbach's alpha values between.80 and.90

Title = {{Ebola separations: trust, crisis, and `social distancing' in West Africa}},

Abstract = {{The Ebola outbreak in West Africa involved the introduction of new forms
   of social and physical separation that aimed to curtail the spread of
   the disease. People changed the ways they lived to avoid contact with
   those who might be sick. A suite of governmental instruments was
   introduced, ranging from by-laws and public health campaigns to the use
   of specialist treatment centres and military force. These events
   transformed social connections and affected possibilities for trust in
   intimate, governmental, and therapeutic relations. Drawing upon
   fieldwork in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea, this article explores
   these forms of separation and social distance ethnographically, with a
   focus on material objects, touch, and spaces of separation. In doing so,
   we contribute to discussions on the constitution of trust and distance
   within social relations, and the ways in which separation can enable
   certain kinds of closeness. Our analysis offers insights for those
   seeking to understand the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on the
   ways that people relate to, and care for, others.}},

Abstract = {{Nano fibrillated cellulose (NFC) has turned into a material widely
   studied due to its desirable performance for numerous organic systems.
   Nevertheless, its surface is not very compatible with most organic
   systems; hence, chemical functionalization methods offer a path to solve
   this problem. In this study, NFC is successfully functionalized with two
   silane coupling agents: 3-glycidyloxypropyl trimethoxysilane (GPS) and
   3-glycidyloxypropyl dimethylethoxysilane (GPMES) by a simple, direct,
   and environmentally friendly method. Different analyses have been
   carried out in order to confirm the chemical modification of NFC.
   ATR-IR, XPS, and Si-29 NMR spectroscopies confirmed the chemical
   modification that allowed the understanding of the structure and the
   conformation onto the modified NFC surface. SEM and AFM microscopies
   were performed to study possible alterations in morphology; a slight
   change was observed. Thermal properties were also analyzed by TGA
   analysis. It remains stable after chemical functionalization. Grafted
   NFC showed good performance compared to the pristine one. It allows a
   better dispersion into organic systems improving their properties. (C)

Title = {{Graphene/high-oriented polypyrrole foam enables new-type ultrasensitive
   micro-distance detection}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{402}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Micro-resolution range finder (MRRF) is an essential tool in various
   cuffing-edge fields such as shooting macro, precision instrument,
   vibration monitoring and micro-collision-avoidance systems. Desirable
   MRRF requires micro-scale precision, high accuracy, rapid response, and
   long-term cycling stability. Yet conventional MRRFs based on optical
   feedback, precise machining, piezoelectric effects and magnetostriction
   are still limited by complicated designs, precise sequence of tasks, and
   cumbersome device volume. As such, for the first time, we present a
   new-type of micro-distance sensor consisting of reduced graphene
   oxide/high-oriented polypyrrole foam (rGO/HOPPyF) for MRRF. Based on the
   distance-resistance property of the as-prepared foam, the microdistance
   sensor has shown advantages of easy operation, low cost, miniaturized
   device. Here, large-rate resistance change and great mechanical
   stability are realized in rGO/HOPPyF, thus allowing precise and accurate
   micro-distance detection. The micro-distance sensor demonstrates
   ultrahigh sensitivities of 386.7, 1260 and 546.7 m(-1) within the
   step-length regions of 10 similar to 80, 80 similar to 290, 290 similar
   to 570 mu m, respectively. Remarkably, both the precision and accuracy
   of our sensor are superior over those of the commercial micrometer and
   laser rangefinders, providing a new technological advance towards
   practical MRRF.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we investigate continuous linear operators between Banach

   characterize finite dimensionality of Banach spaces with the help of
   minimum norm attainment of continuous linear operators. We introduce a
   property called weak minimizing property for Banach spaces related to
   minimum norm attainment of continuous linear operators. We further study
   Lindentrauss type properties AM and BM of Banach spaces for minimum norm
   attaining operators and show that Radon Niko dym property of Banach
   spaces is a sufficient condition for both the properties to hold. We
   also investigate a weaker version of minimum norm attaining operators.

Abstract = {{Detection of hypochlorite ions (ClO-) in the organisms is of great
   significance for finding effective treatments for inflammations and
   diseases. Recently, fluorescent probes have aroused wide public concern
   as one of the effective tools for detecting molecules and ions.
   Nevertheless, due to low sensitivity and poor biocompatibility, the
   effect of fluorescent probes for biological imaging is still not ideal.
   For this, we developed a novel ratiometric fluorescent probe,
   7-(diethylamino)-3((E)-3-(9-ethyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)aayloyl)-2H-chromen-2
   -one (DCC), which could be used for colorimetric detection of ClO-.
   Study showed that, the detection mechanism of DCC is that probe can be
   rapidly oxidized to an enoic acid by ClO-, resulting in a series of
   changes in spectral properties. This mechanism was confirmed
   experimentally and verified by theoretical calculations. It is worth
   mentioning that DCC has not only been successfully applied to the
   detection of exogenous and endogenous OCl- in living cells, but also
   used for the detection of ClO- in zebrafish, and Arabidopsis. (C) 2020

Title = {{A new and rigorous SPN theory - Part IV: Numerical qualification of
   GSP(3)((0)) and the generalized transverse integration nodal method}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF NUCLEAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{149}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{GSP(N)((0)) is the lowest level approximation in the GSPoKTHORN N
   theory, whose highest level GSPoNTHORN N is equivalent to PN.
   GSP(N)((0)) has the same differential equations as the traditional SPN
   but with different interface and boundary conditions. In this paper we
   show that GSP(3)((0)) can be practically implemented and can indeed
   provide much improvement over SP3. The very popular traditional
   transverse integration nodal method cannot be applied to GSP(3)((0))
   because of not being able to theoretically derive the non-flat shape of
   the surface current profile. The GSP(3)((0)) flux continuity condition
   requires at least a linear surface current profile, while its current
   continuity condition requires at least a quadratic surface current
   profile. For practical applications we have developed the generalized
   transverse integration nodal (GTIN) method, where in addition to
   uniformly weighted transverse integration linearly weighted transverse
   integration is used as well. GTIN contains a theoretically derived
   linear profile of the surface current so that it can fully support the
   GSP(3)((0)) flux continuity condition, although only partially
   supporting the GSP(3)((0)) current continuity condition. Numerical
   results for numerous two-dimensional problems are reported to confirm
   the theoretical analysis and expectation, and demonstrate the
   superiority of the GTIN model of GSP(3)((0)) to SP3. Detailed nodal
   coupling equations are derived for the two-dimensional case so that they
   can be directly used by interested readers for code development. (C)

   for wastewater treatment due to their mechanical strength, chemical
   stability, and antifouling ability. Currently, the membranes are
   prepared by SiC-particle sintering at a high temperature. The production
   suffers from long production time and high costs. In this paper, we
   demonstrated a more economical way to produce SiC ultrafiltration
   membranes based on low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD). SiC
   was deposited in the pores of alumina microfiltration supports using two
   precursors (SiH2Cl2 and C2H2/H-2) at a relatively low temperature of 750
   degrees C. Different deposition times varying from 0 to 150 min were
   used to tune membrane pore size. The pure water permeance of the
   membranes only decreased from 350 Lm(-2)h(-1)bar(-1) to 157 Lm(-2)h(-1
   )bar(-1) when the deposition time was increased from 0 to 120 min due to
   the narrowing of membrane pore size from 71 to 47 nm. Increasing the
   deposition time from 120 to 150 min mainly resulted in the formation of
   a thin, dense layer on top of the support instead of in the pores.
   Oil-in-water emulsion filtration experiments illustrated that both the
   reversible and irreversible fouling of the SiC-deposited UF membrane was
   considerably lower as compared to the pristine alumina support. The
   unique feature that pore sizes decrease linearly as a function of SiC
   deposition time creates opportunities to produce low-fouling SiC
   membranes with tuned pore sizes on relatively cheap support.}},

Title = {{3D printing of extended-release tablets of theophylline using
   hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) hydrogels}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{591}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{An extrusion based 3D printer was used to prepare the semi-solid tablets
   with different drug loading dosages (75, 100, 125 mg) under ambient
   temperature. The active pharmaceutical ingredient, theophylline, was
   uploaded within the hydrogels prepared of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose
   (HPMC) K4M or E4M. The HPMC concentrations were adjusted to different
   levels (10 and 12\% w/w) to fulfill the requirements for 3D printing.
   Rheological and textural properties, as well as release profiles, were
   significantly affected by the type and concentration of excipient
   regardless of theophylline doses used. The printing material should
   exhibit shear-thinning behavior, keeping yield stress less than 4000 Pa
   and a loss factor (tans = G `'/G') between 0.2 and 0.7, especially for
   3D printing purposes using the current platform. The SEM images
   demonstrated that the hydrogel matrix exhibited a porous structure,
   which had the potential to encapsulate the theophylline clusters within
   its microstructure. The in vitro dissolution test showed that the
   release of all tablets was extended over 12 h, and the calculation of
   drug release kinetic models revealed that the 3D printed HPMC matrices
   release the theophylline by diffusion and erosion mechanisms. The
   excipient HPMC K4M 12\% w/w hydrogel was optimal to load the
   theophylline with flexible dosage combinations due to the great
   extrudability and shape retention ability. The exploration of
   rheological properties was investigated in this study, and the results
   revealed that it is a feasible method to predict the SSE 3D printability
   and quality of hydrogel-API blend materials for the drug delivery
   system.}},

Title = {{In-situ deformation measurement of Zircaloy-4 cladding tube under
   various transient heating conditions using optical image analysis}},
Journal = {{NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{370}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{In a loss of coolant accident (LOCA), fuel cladding deformation is an
   important factor in terms of maintaining coolable geometry. In order to
   simulate the cladding deformation behavior, experimental research and
   the development of a fuel performance code have been conducted. In
   addition, relevant experimental data concerning the major phenomena for
   validating the developed code are required. Therefore, in this study, an
   experimental apparatus named `DIMAT' (Deformation In-situ Measurement
   Apparatus by image-analysis Technique) is developed to produce high
   temperature cladding tube deformation data. In order to simulate various
   accident conditions, an infrared (IR) furnace and pressure injection
   equipment were assembled. Additionally, the cladding specimen in the IR
   furnace was clearly recorded by application of high temperature
   resistant black spray paint and modification of a quartz tube. Some
   uncertainty factors that might arise due to the paint application were
   considered and evaluated. After the deformation behavior in a scenario
   was recorded, the in-situ hoop strain of the cladding was calculated
   through the developed image analysis method. To ensure accuracy of the
   established image analysis system, a validation experiment and
   uncertainty evaluation were performed. Finally, the burst experiments
   were carried out at low and high heating rates of 1, 14, and 28 degrees
   C/s, and consequently the in-situ high temperature strain rate was
   successfully measured in each experimental case.}},

Title = {{Combination of fuzzy and cognitive theories for adaptive e-assessment}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{161}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{A crucial factor for successful educational results in computer-based
   educational systems and e-learning systems is the learner's assessment.
   Assessment is more effective when it is tailored to each individual
   student's learning needs and abilities. Therefore, a significant
   research challenge is to create tests that include
   exercises/questions/activities etc., which conform to each learner's
   knowledge level and learning needs and abilities. This goal constitutes
   the need for creating adaptive tests. However, the area of adaptive
   e-assessment has not yet been explored sufficiently and thus there is
   scope for a lot of improvement. To this end, in this paper we present a
   novel solution for adaptive e-assessment. The novelty and significance
   lie in the blending of fuzzy logic and cognitive theories for further
   enhancing the personalization and adaptivity in e-assessment.
   Particularly, fuzzy sets are used to describe the knowledge level of
   students in a more realistic way. Furthermore, the cognitive theory of
   Revised Bloom Taxonomy is used to express the learning objectives that
   are required to be assessed through the created test. In addition, a
   fuzzy rule-based reasoner, which decides about the number and the
   difficulty level of the test items that have to be included into the
   created personalized test for each level of the Revised Bloom Taxonomy,
   is used. The fuzzy rules are applied to the fuzzy sets that describe the
   learners' knowledge level. For the formation of the fuzzy sets and
   rules, the opinion of several tutors, holding experience in the
   educational process and instruction, was taken into consideration. The
   created adaptive test comprises distinct test items based on the
   individual learning needs of each student. The presented method has been
   used in two tutoring systems and has been fully evaluated. The
   evaluation results show great accuracy in the selection of test items
   for each individual student. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE
   To evaluate the prognostic value of PCV and blood glucose concentration
   in chelonians presented for veterinary care and to develop risk
   categories on the basis of the interaction of these analytes.
   ANIMALS
   954 client-owned chelonians (34 genera).
   PROCEDURES
   Medical records of 1,059 client-owned chelonians presented to 2
   veterinary institutions between 2014 and 2018 were reviewed. Logistic
   regression models were developed to evaluate factors associated with
   death, including PCV and blood glucose concentrations.
   RESULTS
   There were 954 chelonians (34 genera) for which the data required to be
   included in the analysis were available. Both PCV and blood glucose
   concentration were significant prognostic indicators of death. Odds of
   death for chelonians with severe anemia (PCV, < 10\%) and moderate
   anemia (PCV, 11\% to 20\%) were 6.8 times (adjusted odds ratio {[}aOR],
   6.8; 95\% CI, 3.8 to 12.3) and 1.6 times (aOR, 1.6; 95\% CI, 1.01 to
   2.7), respectively, the odds of death for chelonians with PCV within
   reference range. Odds of death for chelonians with severe hypoglycemia
   (< 30 mg/dL), moderate hyperglycemia (91 to 150 mg/dL), and severe
   hyperglycemia (> 181 mg/ dL) were 5.3 times (aOR, 5.3; 95\% CI; 2.4 to
   11.4), 3 times (aOR, 3.0; 95\% CI, 1.4 to 6.3), and 4.3 times (aOR, 4.3;
   95\% CI, 2.4 to 7.6), respectively, the odds of death for chelonians
   with blood glucose concentration within reference range. Five risk
   categories were identified on the basis of PCV and blood glucose
   concentration.
   CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE
   Derangements in PCV and blood glucose concentration in client-owned
   chelonians were associated with increased odds of death. On the basis of
   these results, more aggressive diagnostic testing and treatments may be
   indicated in chelonians with similar alterations.}},

Title = {{Enhancing the strength of symphonic orchestra in an opera house}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ACOUSTICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{170}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Nowadays, historical opera houses are also employed for symphonic music,
   especially in a country like Italy where they are far more widespread
   than concert halls. The aim of the work presented here is to modify the
   acoustic conditions of an opera house by introducing an overhead
   reflector array and removing drapes from the stage, so to meet the
   requirements for an orchestral performance. The design process and the
   shape optimisation of the canopy layout were developed with a
   Geometrical Acoustic (GA++) model. In-situ acoustic measurements were
   used to calibrate the model, to adjust the tilt angles of the panels and
   to validate the software-aided design. Combining theoretical studies
   with practical needs, the results of this work give the opportunity to
   investigate the consequences of placing a reflector array in an opera
   house. A multi-decay analysis on measured impulse responses shows that
   the reflector array enhances the acoustic coupling between the stage
   house and the main hall. Finally, the blending effect on the orchestral
   sections caused by the reflector array was estimated through a
   simulation employing calibrated virtual instruments. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The genus Phyllodytes comprises 15 species, ten of them having their
   tadpole external morphology described in the literature. However, there
   are few descriptive studies on chondrocranium and hyobranchial skeleton.
   In this work, we describe the chondrocranium and hyobranchial skeleton
   of Phyllodytes larvae and discuss shared features and interspecific
   variation. Our findings suggest that the skeletal morphology is mostly
   conserved in the genus, with common features including a single
   suprarostral cartilage, short infrarostral cartilages, and overall short
   irabecular horns. Main intrageneric variations include the arrangement
   of the ascending process, the presence of larval otic process, and the
   configuration of the crista parotica. These variations are not
   correlated with the phylogenetic structure of the genus. Some
   distinctive aspects of P. praeceptor and P. gyrinaethes are also
   described in tadpoles of Osteopilus ocellatus, and could be related to
   oophagous habits in these tadpoles.}},

Abstract = {{1,2-Hydroxypyridinone (1,2-HOPO) forms very stable transition metal
   complexes that may be useful in various ways, among these the iron
   complexes have been long used for the treatment of iron overload
   diseases like beta-Thalassemia. A new tetradentate chelator,
   1-hydroxy-N-{[}3-{[}2-{[}2-{[}3-{[}(1-hydroxy-6-oxopyridine-2carbonyl)am
   ino]propoxy]ethoxy]ethoxylpropyl]-6-oxo-pyridine-2-carboxamide (L)
   having two 1,2-HOPO units with long chain amine backbone has been
   synthesized and characterized through various techniques like TLC,
   solubility, melting point, FT-IR, H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, ESI-MS, UV-Vis and
   emission spectroscopy. The protonation constants of the ligand were
   determined by both potentiometrically as well as spectrophotometrically
   in aqueous medium at 25 degrees +/- 1 degrees C. The solution
   thermodynamics of the ligand its Fe(III) complexes in aqueous solution
   were also studied. The pK(a) values for ligand are found to be 7.34 and
   6.06 and the formation constant of metal complex (M2L3) is found to be
   log beta(230) = 42.45. To support the experimental data, theoretical
   calculation at DFT level of theory was done using GGA (Gradient
   Generalized Approximation) with BLYP functional and DZP basis set. The
   results of calculated thermodynamic properties suggest that, Delta G
   follows the same trend of protonation as determined by potentiometry and
   spectrophotometry. Studies of the DFT optimized structures of LH2, LH-
   shows that, there is pi stacking interaction between the
   hydroxypyridinone rings in the species and the intramolecular
   pi-stacking interaction decreases as the distance between two pyridine
   ring increases upon deprotonation and was found to be 2.7, 3.2 and 14.6
   A for LH2, LH- and L-2 respectively. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Towards a more balanced combination of multiple traits when computing

Journal = {{METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{443-448}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Functional trait differences between species are key drivers of
   community assembly and ecosystem functioning. Quantifying these
   differences routinely requires using approaches like the Gower distance
   to combine various types of traits into a multi-trait dissimilarity.
   Without special care, the Gower distance can however produce a
   multi-trait dissimilarity with a disproportional contribution of certain
   traits, particularly categorical traits and bundle of correlated traits
   reflecting similar ecological functions. These effects persist even
   after applying multivariate analyses traditionally used to reduce trait
   dimensionality.
   We propose the `gawdis' R function, and corresponding package, to
   produce multi-trait dissimilarity with more uniform contributions of
   different traits, including fuzzy coded ones. The approach is based on
   minimizing the differences in the correlation between the dissimilarity
   of each trait, or groups of traits, and the multi-trait dissimilarity.
   This is done using either an analytical or a numerical solution, both
   available in the function.
   Properly taking into account the contribution of multiple traits into
   multi-trait dissimilarity is key for interpreting the ecological effects
   of complex species differences. The gawdis r package in CRAN can be
   further applied to improve equitability in distance-based measures in
   other field of research, such as social sciences or marketing surveys,
   which routinely analyse mixed type data.}},

Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: After the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines,
   community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae
   has decreased whereas Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes
   could be increasing. These bacteria have been associated with high rates
   of complications.
   Aims: (1) To describe the characteristics of pediatric bacterial CAP
   requiring hospitalization. (2) To compare outcomes according to
   causative microorganisms. (3) To analyze changes in bacterial CAP rate
   and etiology over time.
   Patients and Methods: Retrospective single-center study of inpatients
   aged 1 month-16 years with culture-confirmed bacterial CAP in 2010-2018
   in Madrid, Spain.
   Results: We included 64 cases (42 S. pneumoniae, 13 S. pyogenes and 9 S.
   aureus). Culture-confirmed CAP represented 1.48-2.33/1,000 all-cause
   pediatric hospital admissions, and its rate did not vary over time.
   However, there was a significant decrease in pneumococcal CAP in the
   last 3 years of the study (78\% of CAP in 2010-2015 vs. 48\% in 2016-18,
   p = 0.017). Median hospital stay was 10.5 days (interquartile range
   5-19.5), 38 patients (59\%) developed complications and 28 (44\%) were
   admitted to the intensive care unit. Outcomes were similar among
   children with S. pneumoniae and S. aureus CAP, whereas S. pyogenes was
   associated with a higher risk for complications (OR 8 {[}95\%CI
   1.1-57.2]) and ICU admission (OR 7.1 {[}95\%CI 1.7-29.1]) compared with
   pneumococcal CAP.
   Conclusion: In a setting with high PCV coverage, culture-confirmed
   bacterial CAP did not decrease over time and there was a relative
   increase of S. pyogenes and S. aureus. Children with CAP caused by S.
   pyogenes were more likely to develop complications.}},

Abstract = {{A nonconjugated radical polymer poly
   (4-glycidyloxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl) (PTEO) is explored

   time. The PTEO exhibits a high electrical conductivity of 0.13 S m(-1),
   far exceeding other organic cathode materials ranging from 10 to 10 to
   10(-5) S m(-1). It offers high redox potentials with platueas at similar
   to 3.6 V vs. Li+/Li and 3.3 V vs. Na +/Na, respectively. The PTEO
   cathode with only 30 wt\% carbon additive agent delivers a capacity of
   over 200 mAh g(-1) and energy density of more than 500 Wh kg(-1) for
   both Li/Na ion batteries. Reaction mechanism of the PTEO proceeds
   through the neutral state nitroxide radical (N-O.) to oxoammonium cation
   (+N=O) and the aminoxy anion (N-O center dot). The PTEO is the only
   radical polymer that can deliver a capacity over 200 mAh g(-1) for
   organic cathodes with no more than 50\% carbon additive agent, making it
   a promising organic cathode material for Li/Na ion batteries.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{With Kriging interpolation, analytic hierarchy process and grey
   relational analysis, this paper evaluates the regionalized benefit of
   China's sloping cropland erosion control (SCEC) during 2011-2015,
   including the ecological, economic, social benefit and the comprehensive
   benefit. The results show that, in the ecological benefits, the
   distribution of soil erosion control degree presents patchy
   characteristics. The reduction of runoff modulus gradually decreases
   from southeast to northwest. The reduction of soil erosion modulus is
   the largest in the Northwest Loess Plateau and the smallest in the
   Northeast Black Soil Zone. In the economic benefits, the increase in the
   annual output value per unit land area is characterized by ``high in the
   south and low in the north{''}, but there are patchy high-value areas in
   central Loess Plateau and the Northern Earthy-Rocky Mountain Zone. The
   increase in the agricultural population's per capita income is higher in
   the western area than that in the eastern area. In the social benefits,
   the per capita grain increase in most of the northern China is larger
   than that in the south, while the characteristic agricultural
   development in the south is more advantageous than that in the north.
   The comprehensive benefit is ``high in the south and low in the north;
   highest in the southwest and lowest in the northeast{''}. The spatial
   heterogeneity implies the necessity to specify the influencing factors
   for the SCEC benefit in different areas and take pointed measures to
   improve the benefit.}},

Title = {{Investigation of the microstructure evolution of alpha uranium after in
   pile transient}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{542}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{This work describes the microstructural evolution of textured alpha
   uranium (alpha-U) specimens under different reactor transients achieving
   very low burn-up. The understanding of the behavior of this single phase
   will provide important information to further the material knowledge of
   metallic fuels (e.g. UPu-Zr, U-10Zr). Such alloys are of interest for
   their application in advanced reactor concepts. In metallic fuels a-U
   is, indeed, a relevant phase. Moreover, data on fuel behavior during
   early-stage irradiation are generally lacking and are important to
   validate and develop modelling and simulation tools. Characterization of
   grain boundaries, texture evolution, and phase transformation were
   obtained through scanning electron microscopy coupled with electron
   backscattered diffractometry and transmission electron microscopy.The
   data obtained indicates that phase transformation and microstructural
   change (e.g. recrystallization/grain growth) can occur during rapid
   transient even at low burn up. It is likely that the residual strain in
   the as-fabricated alpha-U specimens and the thermal strain introduced by
   reactor transients played an important role in the recrystallization of
   the alpha-U phase, as well as retaining the beta-U phase at room
   temperature. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Organ-specific effects on glycolysis by the dioxin-activated aryl
   hydrocarbon receptor}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) by the environmental
   toxin dioxin (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, TCDD) causes diverse
   toxicities, including thymus atrophy and hepatosteatosis. The mechanisms
   by which AHR activation by TCDD leads to these toxicities are not fully
   understood. Here we studied the effects of TCDD on a major energy
   pathway, glycolysis, using the chick embryo close to hatching, a
   well-established model for studying dioxin toxicity. We showed that 24
   hr of TCDD treatment causes changes in glycolysis in both thymus and
   liver. In thymus glands, TCDD decreased mRNAs for glycolytic genes and
   glucose transporters, glycolytic indices and levels of IL7 mRNA,
   phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) and HIF1A, stimulators of glycolysis and
   promoters of survival and proliferation of thymic lymphocytes. In
   contrast, in liver, TCDD increased mRNA levels for glycolytic genes and
   glucose transporters, glycolytic endpoints and pAKT levels. Similarly,
   increases by TCDD in mRNA levels for glycolytic genes and glucose
   transporters in human primary hepatocytes showed that effects in chick
   embryo liver pertain also to human cells. Treatment with the glycolytic
   inhibitor 2-deoxy-d-glucose exacerbated the effects on thymus atrophy by
   TCDD, supporting a role for decreased glycolysis in thymus atrophy by
   TCDD, but did not prevent hepatosteatosis. NAD(+) precursors abolished
   TCDD effects on glycolytic endpoints in both thymus and liver. In
   summary, we report here that dioxin disrupts glycolysis mediated energy
   metabolism in both thymus and liver, and that it does so in opposite
   ways, decreasing it in the thymus and increasing it in the liver.
   Further, the findings support NAD(+) boosting as a strategy against
   metabolic effects of environmental pollutants such as dioxins.}},

Abstract = {{Highly thermally conducive polyimide (PI) composites have great
   potential application in the heat-resistance electronic packaging field,
   but the poor interface between the PI matrix and fillers limits their
   application. Herein, we prepared the polydopamine (PDA) modified
   hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN@PDA)/polyimide (PI) composites by a simple
   ``vacuum filtration - hot pressing{''} method. In this composite, the
   interfacial interaction between the PI matrix and h-BN micro-sheets was
   greatly enhanced after PDA modification, and a 2D-aligned structure was
   successfully constructed. In this work, the effect of PDA modification
   on the thermal conductivity, thermal stability and mechanical properties
   of PI composites was fully investigated. The thermal conductivity of the
   h-BN@PDA/PI composites rises as the modified filler increases, and
   reflects a distinct anisotropy on in-plane and through-plane direction.
   The highest in-plane thermal conductivity, 3.01 W m(-1) K-1, is obtained
   in the 20 vol\% h-BN@PDA modified for 6 h (h-BN@PDA(6h))/PI composite,
   about 1405\% higher than pure PI sample, while its T(10\% )reaches 525.2
   degrees C, and the tensile strength and Young's modulus are still high,
   about 38.80 MPa and 8.33 GPa. Our study provides a feasible fabrication
   technology for the high-performance thermal management materials.}},

Abstract = {{Pressure always plays an important role in influencing the structure
   configuration and electronic properties of materials. Here, combining
   density function theory and structure prediction algorithm, we
   systematically studied the Mg3Sb2 system from its phase transition to
   thermodynamic and electronic properties under high pressure. We find
   that two novel phases, namely Cm and C2/m, are stable under high
   pressure. Calculation results of phonon dispersions showed that both
   novel phases have no imaginary frequency, which indicates that the novel
   phases are thermodynamically stable. Due to the larger ionic radius of
   Sb compared to N, P, and As elements, the Mg3Sb2 compound shows a
   different electronic property at high pressure. The electronic
   calculations show that the novel phases of Cm and C2/m of Mg3Sb2 possess
   metallic behavior under high pressure. These results provide new
   insights for understanding the Mg3Sb2 compound.}},

Journal = {{SPECTROCHIMICA ACTA PART A-MOLECULAR AND BIOMOLECULAR SPECTROSCOPY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{243}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{A novel isatin derivative (1) is UV-Visible active and displays about 90
   nm bathochromic shift upon interaction with only Hg2+ and Cu2+, but not
   with other common metal ions. Also, the colorless probe 1 turns to
   brick-red and yellow in the presence of Hg2+ and Cu2+, respectively.
   Addition of increasing amounts of Hg2+ or Cu2+ to 1 leads to the
   emergence of a new absorption at similar to 470 nm (due to LMCT), with a
   concomitant decrease in the intensity of absorption of 1 at similar to
   380 nm, and thereby provides a ratiometric response. Common metal ions
   and anions do not interfere with the interactions of 1 with Hg2+ or Cu2+
   ions. Probe 1 shows very high sensitivity and selectivity towards Hg2+
   and Cu2+ as revealed by their very low detection limits 0.95 x 10(-9) M
   and 1.5 x 10(-9) M, respectively. Formation of 1:1 complex with Hg2+ and
   2:1 complex with Cu2+ is confirmed using NMR, ESI-MS and FT-IR
   techniques, Job plot and DFT calculations. Selective detection of Hg2+
   from Cu2+ is established from the ratiometric response caused by
   beta-mercaptoethanol. Advantages of the probe 1 in terms of high
   sensitivity, stability in the physiological pH and suitability for dual
   detection are presented. Probe impregnated silica plates for onsite
   detection of Hg2+ and Cu2+ present in environmental samples is also
   demonstrated. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{Essential oils mediated antivirulence therapy against vibriosis in
   Penaeus vannamei}},
Journal = {{AQUACULTURE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{529}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The emergence of new virulent Vibrio strains resistant to common
   antibiotics has caused significant economic losses to shrimp farming
   worldwide. It is mandatory to adopt new strategies to control shrimp
   farming related vibriosis. Essential oils (EOs) have several biological
   properties among of which the quorum sensing (QS) inhibitory activity is
   appealing for vibriosis control. In this work, we evaluated QS
   inhibitory activity of five EOs obtained from oregano (Organum vulgare),
   tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia), lemongrass (Cymbopogon citrates),
   cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum) and thyme (Thymus vulgaris), at sublethal
   doses. EOs involvement in bioluminescence shutdown, biofilm formation
   and swarming motility was evaluated in four Vibrio strains of
   aquaculture interest including V. harveyi, V. campbellii, V. vulnificus,
   and V. parahaemolyticus. Oregano oil (EOOv) and tea tree oil (EOMa) were
   further tested in in vivo assays due to their significant effects (P <
   0.05) on QS inhibition. EOOv was the most efficient one and exerted a
   comparable QS inhibitory effect to EOMa at a lower concentration in vivo
   (2.5 mu g mL -1 of EOMa versus 1.0 mu g mL(-1) of EOOv). The lowest
   active doses of EOOv and EOMa that inhibited QS had no toxic effects on
   hemocytes and larvae of P. vannamei. A challenge test was performed in
   P. vannamei postlarvae (PL8) with V. campbellii, grown previously in the
   presence of EOOv or EOMa at sublethal active doses. Our results
   indicated that both EOs affected the virulence of V. campbellii and were
   able to significantly (P < 0.05) reduce shrimp mortality (EOOv in a 40\%
   while EOMa in a 32\%). A field bioassay was also carried in earthen
   ponds to test two different concentrations of EOOv and EOMa for feed
   supplementation (2.5 and 5.0 mg kg(-1) respectively). EOOv increased
   significantly (P < 0.05) shrimp survival and yield at both doses,
   whereas EOMa increased shrimp survival and yield only at the highest
   dose. In conclusion, EOOv and EOMa constitute suitable alternatives to
   reduce vibrios virulence and to increase yield in shrimp culture
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{The sensitivity to contaminants of natural populations varies greatly
   depending on their historical exposure and on the sex of the individual.
   These factors result in great uncertainty in ecotoxicological risk
   assessments and challenge the protection of marine biodiversity. This
   study investigated the role of background pollution in the environment
   in shaping the sensitivity of males and females of the common marine
   amphipod Allorchestes compressa to the common trace marine pollutant,
   copper (Cu). Female and male amphipods were collected from two sites:
   Geelong (the polluted site) and Clifton Springs (the clean site).
   Amphipods were exposed to Cu treatments of 0, 50, 100, and 250 mu g/L
   for 10 days, followed by a 10-day recovery period. Cu-exposed males from
   Geelong showed a reduction in feeding rate at a higher Cu concentration
   than males from Clifton Springs, suggesting that they have a higher
   tolerance to Cu than males from Clifton Springs. This can be explained
   by their higher base level of metallothioneins (MTs) and
   glutathione-S-transferase (GST), the key physiological responses for
   detoxification and defence against damages from Cu toxicity. Males
   showed a higher tolerance to Cu than females. This pattern was similar
   in both populations, which may be associated with a higher level of GST.
   During the recovery period, only males from Geelong fully recovered to
   the control level. Our results emphasize the importance of considering
   population- and sex-specific sensitivity of invertebrates to
   contaminants in eco-toxicological risk assessments.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, the multi-targeting antivirulence activity of
   tannic acid (TA) was explored against Proteus mirabilis through MS-based
   proteomic approach. The in vitro biofilm biomass quantification assay
   and microscopic analysis demonstrated the antibiofilm activity of TA
   against P. mirabilis in which, minimum biofilm inhibitory concentration
   (MBIC) of TA was found to be 200 mu g/mL concentration. Moreover, the
   nanoscale liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry
   (nano LC-MS/MS) analysis revealed that TA (at MBIC) differentially
   regulated the proteins involved in fimbrial adhesion, flagellar
   motility, iron acquisition, Fe-S cluster assembly, heat shock response,
   virulence enzymes, and toxin secretion. Further, the transcriptomic
   analysis validated the outcomes of proteomic analysis in which, the
   expression level of virulence genes responsible for MR/P fimbrial
   adhesion (mrpA), flagellar transcriptional activation (flhD),
   biosynthesis of urease (ureR), hemolysin (hpmA), non-ribosomal peptide
   siderophore system (Nrp), oxidative stress responsible enzymes and
   fitness factors proteins were down-regulated in TA exposed P. mirabilis.
   These observations were also in correspondence with the in vitro
   bioassays. Thus, this study reports the feasibility of TA to act as a
   promising therapeutic agent against multifactorial P. mirabilis
   infections. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Coastal palaeoenvironments and hunter-gatherer plant-use at Waterfall
   Bluff rock shelter in Mpondoland (South Africa) from MIS 3 to the Early

Abstract = {{Waterfall Bluff, in Eastern Mpondoland (Eastern Cape Province, South
   Africa), is a recently excavated archaeological site with deposits
   spanning Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 to the Middle Holocene. Here, we
   present preliminary results of a multi-proxy palaeoenvironmental study
   combining macro-botanical remains, charcoal, phytoliths, pollen and
   plant waxes derived from the same archaeological record. We aim to
   understand the interactions between hunter-gatherer plant foraging and
   climate and environmental change in coastal Mpondoland from MIS 3 to the
   Early Holocene at Waterfall Bluff. The charcoal and pollen records at
   Waterfall Bluff show the gathering of a variety of woody taxa
   characterised by their combustion and medicinal properties (e.g.,
   Millettia grandis and Apodytes dimidiate). The leaves identified in the
   macrobotanics and in the phytolith record might belong to some of these
   taxa and it is likely that they were used for medicinal purposes. From a
   palaeoenvironmental perspective, our results indicate low precipitation
   and low rainfall seasonality under cool conditions during MIS 3 and the
   Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Under these conditions, open woodlands
   interspersed with dry and hygrophilous grasslands and bushveld
   vegetation with significant representation of fynbos elements occurred
   in the local landscapes probably along Podocarpus/Afrocarpus forests.
   The latter could have been (1) present along river valleys and scarps on
   the Mpondoland exposed continental shelf towards the south and west of
   Waterfall Bluff, supported by palaeo-rivers and cool temperatures
   favouring low evapotranspiration, or (2) present in the interior with
   pollen grains possibly transported to the site by intensified westerly
   winds. These forests contracted as a result of the post-glacial marine
   transgression or reduced westerlies following the LGM. During the Early
   Holocene, the palaeoenvironmental signal points to higher summer
   rainfall and higher (summer) seasonality than during MIS 3, the LGM and
   the LGIT. These changes are coeval with an increase of coastal forests
   and C-4 mesic grasslands with localized wetland vegetation around
   Waterfall Bluff. These multi-proxy archaeobotanical and biochemical data
   show that landscapes surrounding Waterfall Bluff changed in relation to
   marine transgressions/regressions and changes in rainfall intensity and
   seasonality. The people of Waterfall Bluff foraged the coasts during
   glacial periods to collect wood. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Patients undergoing radiation treatment for head and neck cancer
   experience significant side-effects that can impact a wide range of
   daily activities. Patients often report receiving insufficient
   information during and after treatment, which could impede
   rehabilitation efforts; they may also encounter practical and logistical
   barriers to receipt of supportive care. Thus, we developed a web-based
   program, My Journey Ahead, to provide information and strategies for
   managing symptom-focused concerns, which may be easily accessed from the
   patient's home. The purpose of this study was to evaluate patient
   acceptability and satisfaction with the My Journey Ahead program. In
   Phase 1, five patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
   (HNSCC) reviewed the web-based program and provided initial feedback,
   which informed program modifications. In Phase 2, 55 patients were
   recruited to evaluate the program. Patient assessments were obtained
   prior to and after use of the web-based program, and included measures
   of psychological distress, self-efficacy in coping with cancer-related
   issues, and satisfaction with the website. Among the 55 patients
   enrolled, 44 logged in and viewed the web-based program. Participants
   reported high levels of satisfaction with the information received, and
   indicated that the website was interesting and easy to use. Older age
   and higher levels of self-efficacy in coping were each associated with
   higher levels of satisfaction with the website. In summary, the
   web-based program was well-received by patients, the majority of whom
   found it to be informative and useful. An easy-to-use web-based program,
   particularly for older patients who may have difficulty locating
   reliable evidence-based information on the internet, may be helpful in
   addressing survivors' needs in symptom management and coping with
   cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Amine-terminated self-assembled monolayers are molecular nanolayers,
   typically formed via wet-chemical solution on specific substrates for
   precision surface engineering or interface modification. However,
   homogeneous assembling of a highly ordered monolayer by the facile, wet
   method is rather tricky because it involves process parameters, such as
   solvent type, molecular concentration, soaking time and temperature, and
   humidity level. Here, we select 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APTMS) as
   a model molecule of aminosilane for the silanization of nanoporous
   carbon-doped organosilicate (p-SiOCH) under tightly controlled process
   environments. Surface mean roughness (R-a) and the water contact angle
   (theta) of the p-SiOCH layers upon silanization at a 10\%
   humidity-controlled environment behave similarly and follow a
   three-stage evolution: a leap to a maximum at 15 min for R-a (from 0.227
   to 0.411 nm) and theta (from 25 to 86 degrees), followed by a gradual
   decrease to 0.225 nm and 69 degrees, finally leveling off at the above
   values (>60 min). The -NH3+ fraction indicating monolayer disorientation
   evolves in a similar fashion. The fully grown monolayer is highly
   oriented yielding an unprecedented low -NH3+ fraction of 0.08 (and 0.92
   of upright -NH2 groups). However, while having a similar thickness of
   approximately 1.4 +/- 0.1 nm, the molecular layers grown at 30\%
   relative humidity exhibit a significantly elevated -NH3+ fraction of
   0.42, indicating that controlling the humidity is vital to the
   fabrication of highly oriented APTMS molecular layers. A
   bonding-structure evolution model, as distinct from those offered
   previously, is proposed and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Overexpression of the MYC oncoprotein is an initiating step in the
   formation of several cancers. MYC frequently recruits
   chromatin-modifying complexes to DNA to amplify the expression of
   cancer-promoting genes, including those regulating cell cyde,
   proliferation, and metabolism, yet the roles of specific modifiers in
   different cancer types are not well defined. Here, we show that GCN5 is
   an essential coactivator of cell-cycle gene expression driven by MYC
   overexpression and that deletion of Gcn5 delays or abrogates
   tumorigenesis in the E mu-Myr mouse model of B-cell lymphoma. Our
   results demonstrate that Gcn5 loss impacts both expression and
   downstream functions of Myc.
   Significance: Our results provide important proof of principle for Gcn5
   functions in formation and progression of Myc-driven cancers, suggesting
   that GCN5 may be a viable target for development of new cancer
   therapies.}},

Title = {{Analysis of a LBLOCA with FLEX actuations in a PWR-W}},
Journal = {{NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{370}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{After the Fukushima-Daiichi accident, different methods, strategies and
   guidelines were developed to improve the Severe Accident Management
   Guidelines (SAMG). One of these additions, named the FLEX strategies,
   relies on portable equipment to obtain power or water to restore key
   safety functions in the reactor.
   In the present study, the FLEX strategies are studied under an in-vessel
   molten core retention scenario; these actions will try to avoid the
   reactor pressure vessel failure when the core is in a degraded or molten
   state. In order to analyze this sequence, a large break LOCA is
   simulated in a three loops PWR-W using the MELCOR 2.2 code.
   During the simulated sequences different configurations are assessed;
   the water injection by the ECCS during the recirculation phase is
   supposed to fail at different times, and the water injection with
   portable equipment subsequently occurs also at different times after the
   ECCS failure. Additionally, different water injection rates are also
   analyzed to compare different portable pumps capabilities.
   The obtained results agree with previous literature, i.e. the reactor
   vessel failure could be precluded if the water injection with portable
   equipment starts before there is a large amount of corium in the lower
   head. No significant differences are found between different water
   injection rates (20-60 kg/s) to prevent vessel failure, but it does have
   an impact on the containment pressure and hydrogen generated.}},

Title = {{Glassdoor's best places to work internationally: Are they best for

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCE \& ECONOMICS}},
Abstract = {{In 2015, Glassdoor published its first international Best Places to Work
   list in the United Kingdom. Since then, Glassdoor has begun publishing
   10 different Best Places to Work lists in 9 different countries.
   Glassdoor's Best Places to Work lists are unique in that rankings are
   solely based upon employee reviews and are not influenced by
   self-nominations or a cost paid by a company. With 64 million unique
   visitors each month, these Glassdoor lists have the potential to impact
   investors. In this paper, we explore whether firms appearing on lists
   for Canada, France, Germany and the United Kingdom result in short-term
   announcement effects or long-term abnormal returns on a raw- and
   risk-adjusted basis. We find that the Canadian sample earns
   statistically significant abnormal returns in the announcement window 5
   days after the announcement date. In the long run, we find that the
   Canadian sample also outperforms its matched sample and local index on a

Title = {{Estimation of vineyard soil structure and preferential flow using dye

Journal = {{GEODERMA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{380}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The appearance and distribution of soil pores have a significant
   influence on water flow and solute transport in the soil vadose zone.
   The pore system is highly variable in arable soils where crop rotation,
   tillage, trafficking, soil amendments, and various management practices
   are commonly implemented. The aim of this study was to assess the porous
   system and preferential flow pathways in a vineyard soil using
   undisturbed soil columns, and by combining laboratory and numerical
   methods with dye staining and X-ray imaging. It was hypothesized that
   the integration of various methods could reveal more information about
   soil structure, and flow and transport behavior of structured arable
   soil. Soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves were
   obtained using the evaporation method, while water flow was assessed
   using intermittent leaching experiments. Water flow and the transport of
   Brilliant Blue were simulated using HYDRUS-1D. A single-porosity model
   of soil hydraulic properties provided a good description of data
   collected during the evaporation experiments. Data collected during
   leaching experiments did not provide enough experimental evidence for
   the occurrence of nonequilibrium flow patterns and the differentiation
   between the single- and dual-permeability models of soil hydraulic
   properties. However, dye staining and X-ray imaging revealed a complex
   pore-architecture network with large vertical and horizontal biopores.
   The staining patterns (Brilliant Blue FCF) within the vertical column
   sections documented the extent of preferential flow. The study showed
   that the bi-modal character of pore structure could often be hidden when
   a limited number or non-adequate methods are applied for its
   quantification from water flow behavior. The impact of preferential
   pathways on dye transport can be investigated with observations and
   simulations. A combination of various methods enabled us to adequately
   assess vineyard soil structure and fine-tune the description and extent
   of preferential water flow.}},

Title = {{Dielectric Elastomer Actuator Driven Soft Robotic Structures With
   Bioinspired Skeletal and Muscular Reinforcement}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ROBOTICS AND AI}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Natural motion types found in skeletal and muscular systems of
   vertebrate animals inspire researchers to transfer this ability into
   engineered motion, which is highly desired in robotic systems.
   Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) have shown promising capabilities
   as artificial muscles for driving such structures, as they are soft,
   lightweight, and can generate large strokes. For maximum performance,
   dielectric elastomer membranes need to be sufficiently pre-stretched.
   This fact is challenging, because it is difficult to integrate
   pre-stretched membranes into entirely soft systems, since the stored
   strain energy can significantly deform soft elements. Here, we present a
   soft robotic structure, possessing a bioinspired skeleton integrated
   into a soft body element, driven by an antagonistic pair of DEA
   artificial muscles, that enable the robot bending. In its equilibrium
   state, the setup maintains optimum isotropic pre-stretch. The robot
   itself has a length of 60 mm and is based on a flexible silicone body,
   possessing embedded transverse 3D printed struts. These rigid bone-like
   elements lead to an anisotropic bending stiffness, which only allows
   bending in one plane while maintaining the DEA's necessary pre-stretch
   in the other planes. The bones, therefore, define the degrees of freedom
   and stabilize the system. The DEAs are manufactured by aerosol
   deposition of a carbon-silicone-composite ink onto a stretchable
   membrane that is heat cured. Afterwards, the actuators are bonded to the
   top and bottom of the silicone body. The robotic structure shows large
   and defined bimorph bending curvature and operates in static as well as
   dynamic motion. Our experiments describe the influence of membrane
   pre-stretch and varied stiffness of the silicone body on the static and
   dynamic bending displacement, resonance frequencies and blocking forces.
   We also present an analytical model based on the Classical Laminate
   Theory for the identification of the main influencing parameters. Due to
   the simple design and processing, our new concept of a bioinspired DEA
   based robotic structure, with skeletal and muscular reinforcement,
   offers a wide range of robotic application.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives We analyzed growth rates of benign ovarian serous
   cystadenomas and cystadenofibromas to understand what percentage would
   show a volume doubling time (DT) of less than 3 years, between 3 and 5
   years, or greater than 5 years.
   Methods We retrospectively reviewed pathology records (January 1, 2014,
   to June 30, 2019) to find all surgically excised ovarian serous
   cystadenomas and cystadenofibromas. Imaging records were then reviewed
   to identify those that had been confidently identified with ultrasound
   imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, or computed tomography at least
   twice before surgical removal, with at least a 60-day interval between
   studies. Three orthogonal measurements were recorded on the first and
   last imaging studies on which the mass was detected, with volume
   calculations by the prolate formula (product of 3 measurements
   multiplied by 0.52). The volume DT was calculated and grouped into 1 of
   5 categories: (1) DT of less than 1 year; (2) DT of 1 to 3 years; (3) DT
   of 3 to 5 years; (4) DT of 5 to 10 years; and (5) no growth (any mass
   with a DT >10 years or showing a decrease in volume).
   Results A total of 102 of 536 cystadenomas and 44 of 227
   cystadenofibromas met inclusion criteria. Of the 146 tumors, 40 (27.4\%)
   had a DT of less than 1 year; 38 (26.0\%) had a DT of 1 to 3 years; 22
   (15.1\%) had a DT of 3 to 5 years; 10 (6.8\%) had a DT of 5 to 10 years;
   and 36 (24.7\%) showed no growth.
   Conclusions A total of 53.4\% of ovarian serous
   cystadenomas/cystadenofibromas have a DT of less than 3 years; 15.1\%
   have a DT between 3 and 5 years; and 31.5\% have a DT of greater than 5
   years or show no growth.}},

Title = {{Microwave deposition synthesis of Ni(OH)(2)/sorghum stalk biomass carbon
   electrode materials for supercapacitors}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Recycling of biomass wastes is an effective strategy to maximize
   resource utilization. Bio-waste derived carbon is a typical example of
   waste reuse, which has been used as supercapacitor electrode materials.
   Unfortunately, bare carbon usually possesses low specific capacitance
   and energy density. Combination of carbon and pseudocapacitive materials
   has been proved effective to achieve ideal capacitive performances. In
   this work, biomass carbon is firstly prepared using sorghum stalk as raw
   materials, and Ni(OH)(2) is grown on sorghum stalk biomass carbon by a
   microwave deposition method. The resulting Ni(OH)(2)/sorghum stalk
   biomass carbon exhibits specific capacitances of 889.2 and 490.1 F g(-1)
   at current densities of 2 and 20 A g(-1), respectively. Moreover, 95.9\%
   of capacitance is maintained over 30,000 cycles at 20 A g(-1), unveiling
   exceptional cycling performances. Effective disposal of bio-wastes and
   preparation of electrode materials are both accomplished in this work.
   The microwave deposition allows fast growth of uniform Ni(OH)(2) on
   sorghum stalk biomass carbon, ensuring outstanding capacitive
   performances. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Implantable fibrous scaffold with hierarchical microstructure for the
   `on-site' synergistic cancer therapy}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{402}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The tissue-targeting delivery and intracellular transportation of
   therapeutics have been highly demanded for effective cancer therapy, but
   remains challenging. We hereby report an implantable scaffold consisting
   of composite fibers with unique particle-on-fiber microstructure for
   localized synergistic chemo-/starvation therapy. In this system, silica
   nanoparticles are loaded with glucose oxidase (GOx) and protected by a
   poly dopamine (PDA) coating. A hypoxia-activated prodrug (banoxantrone,
   AQ4N) is absorbed at the particle surface (MGPA). Meanwhile,
   biodegradable fibrous scaffold, composed of polycaprolactone (PCL) and
   gelatin, are incorporated with hyaluronidase (HAase), and self-assembled
   with MGPA nanoparticles. When the composite scaffold is implanted at the
   tumor site, particle liberation occurs in a pH-dependent manner. HAase
   released effectively decomposes extracellular matrix (ECM), and thereby
   promote the cellular uptake of MGPA nano particles. Subsequently, MGPA
   exhausts intracellular glucose and O-2, and in turn activates AQ4N to
   toxic AQ4. The findings indicate that this scaffold can significantly
   enhance accumulation of therapeutics at tumor site for a prolonged
   period and resulted in promoted tumor inhibition. This study has
   therefore proposed an alternative design of therapeutic device,
   potentially combining advantages of nanoparticle-form and implantable
   drug delivery systems, for cancer treatment with high efficacy.}},

Journal = {{CYBERSECURITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Software vulnerabilities, when actively exploited by malicious parties,
   can lead to catastrophic consequences. Proper handling of software
   vulnerabilities is essential in the industrial context, particularly
   when the software is deployed in critical infrastructures. Therefore,
   several industrial standards mandate secure coding guidelines and
   industrial software developers' training, as software quality is a
   significant contributor to secure software. CyberSecurity Challenges
   (CSC) form a method that combines serious game techniques with
   cybersecurity and secure coding guidelines to raise secure coding
   awareness of software developers in the industry. These cybersecurity
   awareness events have been used with success in industrial environments.
   However, until now, these coached events took place on-site. In the
   present work, we briefly introduce cybersecurity challenges and propose
   a novel platform that allows these events to take place online. The
   introduced cybersecurity awareness platform, which the authors call
   Sifu, performs automatic assessment of challenges in compliance to
   secure coding guidelines, and uses an artificial intelligence method to
   provide players with solution-guiding hints. Furthermore, due to its
   characteristics, the Sifu platform allows for remote (online) learning,
   in times of social distancing. The CyberSecurity Challenges events based
   on the Sifu platform were evaluated during four online real-life CSC
   events. We report on three surveys showing that the Sifu platform's CSC
   events are adequate to raise industry software developers awareness on
   secure coding.}},

   transforms to the fcc structure and the dhcp structure is the second

Title = {{Effect of Broken Coffee Beans Particle Size, Roasting Temperature, and
   Roasting Time on Quality of Coffee Beverage}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FOOD QUALITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Optimum flavor and aroma of the coffee are developed during the roasting
   process. However, certain problems exist in the coffee roasting process
   such as partial charring, over roasting, and poor temperature
   distribution across the coffee bean (due to the low thermal conductivity
   of bean), if conditions are not optimized. Hence, uniform temperature
   distribution across the coffee bean in the roasting process is highly
   desirable. To achieve these requirements, the broken coffee beans were
   positioned in a single layer packed bed arrangement using the closed
   system by circulating hot air. In this experiment, three factors were
   arranged in a completely randomized design with three levels and three
   replications. The first factor considered was roasting temperature (200
   degrees C, 230 degrees C, and 260 degrees C), second factor was roasting
   time (5 min, 10 min, and 15 min), and third was particle size (4-6 mm,
   2.36-3.35 mm, and 1.7-2.36 mm). The initial moisture content of raw
   beans (cv. Limu) was determined. The data were collected on selective
   physical properties of roasted coffee beans and sensory acceptability of
   prepared beverage. The results showed that the physical properties and
   sensory acceptability are significantly high (P<0.001). It depends on
   the interaction effect of all the studied factors. Among the studies
   parameters, roasting temperature of 230 degrees C with a particle size
   range of 4-6 mm showed the steady transition in dry mass loss and change
   in bulk density with increase in roasting duration. Coffee roasted at
   230 degrees C for 10 min with a particle size of 4-6 mm showed the
   highest sensory acceptability score (89.21). In conclusion, it can be
   said that a temperature of 230 degrees C, a time of 10 min, and a
   particle size between 2.36-3.35 mm and 4-6 mm are recommended conditions
   for the roasting process of coffee beans.}},

Title = {{On the impact of C-band in place of L-band radar for SMAP downscaling}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{251}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Soil Moisture
   Active Passive (SMAP) mission was launched on 31st January 2015, with
   the aim of providing global soil moisture maps at 9 km spatial
   resolution by combining L-band radar and radiometer observations.
   However, after the SMAP radar became inoperable, NASA decided to utilize
   the Sentinel 1A/1B C-band SAR data in its place. The new version of
   baseline brightness temperature (Tb) downscaling algorithm for SMAP is
   tested using L-band airborne data to evaluate the cap-abilities of the
   C-band Sentinel-1A SAR relative to L-band radar data in downscaling the
   SMAP Tb for achieving high resolution brightness temperature. In this
   study, the downscaling algorithm used L-band airborne Synthetic Aperture
   Radar (SAR) backscatter (sigma) collected from the fifth Soil Moisture
   Active Passive Experiment (SMAPEx5) in south-eastern Australia to
   downscale 36 km L-band SMAP radiometer Tb pixels to 3 km and 9 km. The
   downscaling results were then compared with the published results using
   Sentinel-1A C-band backscatter, and evaluated against airborne 1 km
   resolution L-band passive microwave brightness temperature collected
   from SMAPEx-5. The results show that for vertical polarization the
   average Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of downscaled Tb when compared
   with reference airborne Tb across 4 days at 9 km resolution were 4.9 K
   for L band and 6.0 K for C-band, and increased to 9.3 K for L-band and
   9.6 K for C-band at 3 km spatial resolution. Moreover, the correlation
   coefficient (R) of downscaled and reference Tb across the 4 days was
   0.92 for L-band and 0.88 for C-band at 9 km, decreasing to 0.75 for
   L-band and 0.72 for C-band at 3 km spatial resolution. Accordingly, the
   RMSE increased and the correlation coefficient decreased when using
   C-band radar data in place of that at L-band. However, overall there is
   expected to be only a slight decrease in performance of the downscaling
   algorithm by using the Sentinel 1A data in place of the SMAP radar.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work is to prepare nanofibrous scaffolds based on poly
   (L-lactide-D, L-lactide)/poly (acrylic acid) {[}PLDLLA/PAAc] blends in
   the presence of Dexamethasone {[}Dexa]-loaded poly (2-hydroxyethyl
   methacrylate) {[}HEMA] as molecular imprinted polymer {[}MIP]
   nanoparticles {[}NPs] for enhancing osteogenesis. By adding 10 wt\% of
   PAAc to the PLDLLA and employing response surface methodology, the
   average diameter of the electrospun nanofibers is approximately 237 nm.
   To increase the osteogenesis performance of the optimized nanofibrous
   scaffolds, the MIP nanoparticles are synthesized using HEMA monomer and
   Dexa template with a molar ratio of 10 to 1. Accordingly, these
   crosslinked drug nanocarriers exhibit an average diameter of around 122
   nm and imprinting factor of approximately 1.8, enabling to adsorb Dexa
   molecules around 57\%. Afterward, the Dexa-loaded MIP NPs have
   capability of a controlled drug release with ultimate value of 60\%
   during 72 h. The simultaneous use of PLDLLA/PAAc-10 nanofibrous scaffold
   and Dexa-loaded MIP NPs within the cultivation media of fibroblast
   andmesenchymal stem cells is carried out by thiazolyl blue assay and
   acridine/ethidiumbromide staining as well as alkaline phosphate/calcium
   content test, and alizarin red staining. The results reveal the
   remarkable efficiency of the blend nanofibers besides the MIP containing
   Dexa, thereby using for bone tissue engineering applications,
   potentially. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is associated with hippocampal
   alterations that can increase the risk of short-term memory impairments
   later in life. Despite the role of hippocampal neurogenesis in learning
   and memory, research into the long-lasting impact of IUGR on these
   processes is limited. We aimed to determine the effects of IUGR on
   neuronal proliferation, differentiation and morphology, and on memory
   function at adolescent equivalent age. At embryonic day (E) 18 (term
   similar to E22), placental insufficiency was induced in pregnant Wistar
   rats via bilateral uterine vessel ligation to generate IUGR offspring (n
   = 10); control offspring (n = 11) were generated via sham surgery. From
   postnatal day (P) 36-44, spontaneous location recognition (SLR), novel
   object location and recognition (NOL, NOR), and open field tests were
   performed. Brains were collected at P45 to assess neurogenesis
   (immunohistochemistry), dendritic morphology (Golgi staining), and
   brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression (BDNF; Western blot
   analysis). In IUGR versus control rats there was no difference in object
   preference in the NOL or NOR, the similar and dissimilar condition of
   the SLR task, or in locomotion and anxiety-like behavior in the open
   field. There was a significant increase in the linear density of
   immature neurons (DCX+) in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate
   gyrus (DG), but no difference in the linear density of proliferating
   cells (Ki67+) in the SGZ, nor in areal density of mature neurons (NeuN+)
   or microglia (Iba-1+) in the DG in IUGR rats compared to controls.
   Dendritic morphology of dentate granule cells did not differ between
   groups. Protein expression of the BDNF precursor (pro-BDNF), but not
   mature BDNF, was increased in the hippocampus of IUGR compared with
   control rats. These findings highlight that while the long-lasting
   prenatal hypoxic environment may impact brain development, it may not
   impact hippocampal-dependent learning and memory in adolescence.}},

Abstract = {{Background: To mitigate increased risk of premature cardiovascular
   disease in antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppressed adults living with
   HIV (PWH), low-dose methotrexate (LDMTX) was evaluated in a multicenter
   randomized placebo controlled clinical trial of 176 PWH taking various
   ART regimens (ACTG A5314). Given shared methotrexate (MTX) and tenofovir
   (TFV) pharmacokinetic (PK) pathways, a substudy was conducted to
   investigate whether LDMTX alters TFV exposure.
   Methods: Adults virally suppressed on ART for >24 weeks were randomized
   to LDMTX or placebo. The first 66 participants taking a tenofovir
   disoproxil fumarate-containing regimen underwent intensive PK sampling
   over 24 hours after the second dose of LDMTX 10 mg or placebo. TFV and
   MTX levels were quantified using validated mass spectrometry methods.
   TFV PK between LDMTX and placebo groups were compared and MTX PK was
   characterized.
   Results: Forty-eight participants completed this substudy (n = 20 on
   LDMTX and 28 on placebo). Baseline characteristics were balanced except
   for protease inhibitor (PI)-use (25\% in LDMTX and 43\% in placebo
   groups). For TFV, AUC(6) (primary endpoint), and AUC(24,imputed), C-max,
   and C-min (secondary endpoints) were on average 22\%, and 24\%, 27\%,
   and 31\% less in the LDMTX versus placebo groups, with reductions in
   secondary endpoints reaching statistical significance. Additional
   analyses suggested a greater reduction in the absence of PI although not
   significant.
   Conclusion: Lower TFV AUC(24, imputed) and C-max indicates that LDMTX
   reduces TFV exposure in PWH. However, this change was modest, not
   warranting a change in TFV dosing at this time. Further studies of TFV
   PK with LDMTX, especially without PI coadministration, are warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Three different composites were produced, based on zinc oxide and
   biochar (ZnO/biochar), varying the type of biomass (Salvinia molesta:
   SM; exhausted husk of black wattle: EH; and sugarcane bagasse: SB), with
   pyrolysis under mild conditions at 350 and 450 degrees C. Evaluation was
   made of the capacities of the composites for photocatalytic degradation
   of sulfamethoxazole antibiotic (SMX) andmethyl orange dye (MO). The
   properties of the prepared compositeswere influenced by the biomass
   source, with larger crystallite size (SB), lower band gap energy (SM),
   higher specific surface area (SB), and larger pore size (SM) resulting
   in higher photocatalytic efficiency. Good degradation results were
   obtained using these innovative photocatalysts prepared at low
   temperatures, when compared to ZnO/biocharmaterials reported in previous
   studies. The best degradation capacities were obtained for the
   composites produced at 450 degrees C from SB and SM, with 99.3 and 97\%

Title = {{Long-term setup of a displacement pile in clay: An analytical framework}},
Journal = {{OCEAN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{218}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper integrates the effects of pile installation, reconsolidation,
   pile loading and soil ageing into an analytical framework to predict the
   long-term setup of a displacement pile in clay. The increase of mean
   effective stress and the decrease of void ratio of surrounding clay
   during reconsolidation and soil ageing are determined to quantify the
   changes in undrained shear strength and shear modulus, which are the two
   key soil parameters controlling load carrying behaviours of piles. The
   bearing capacity factors and load-transfer curves are developed by
   incorporating the developed soil parameters. The analytical framework is
   then proposed and validated by predicting a well-documented pile field
   test. Good agreements between the analytical results and the measured
   data demonstrate that the pile setup can bereasonably predicted by the
   proposed framework. Comprehensive parametric studies are conducted to
   investigate the influences of overconsolidation ratio, secondary
   compression index and pile loading on the pile setup. The results
   indicate that a displacement pile in clay with a smaller
   overconsolidation ratio or a larger secondary compression index, or
   subjected to a larger load, exhibits a larger long-term bearing
   capacity.}},

Abstract = {{The Peruvian sea represents one of the most productive ocean ecosystems
   and possesses one of the largest elasmobranch fisheries in the Pacific
   Ocean. Ecosystem-based management of these fisheries will require
   information on the trophic ecology of elasmobranchs. This study aimed to
   understand the diet, trophic interactions and the role of nine
   commercial elasmobranch species in northern Peru through the analysis of
   stomach contents. A total of 865 non-empty stomachs were analysed. Off
   northern Peru, elasmobranchs function as upper-trophic-level species
   consuming 78 prey items, predominantly teleosts and cephalopods. Two
   distinctive trophic assemblages were identified: (a) sharks (smooth
   hammerhead shark Sphyrna zygaena, thresher shark Alopias spp. and blue
   shark Prionace glauca) that feed mainly on cephalopods in the pelagic
   ecosystem; and (b) sharks and batoids (Chilean eagle ray Myliobatis
   chilensis, humpback smooth-hound Mustelus whitneyi, spotted houndshark
   Triakis maculata, Pacific guitarfish Pseudobatos planiceps, copper shark
   Carcharhinus brachyurus and school shark Galeorhinus galeus) that feed
   mainly on teleosts and invertebrates in the benthonic and pelagic
   coastal ecosystem. This study reveals for the first time the diet of T.
   maculata and the importance of elasmobranchs as predators of abundant
   and commercial species (i.e., jumbo squid Dosidicus gigas and Peruvian
   anchovy Engraulis ringens). The results of this study can assist in the
   design of an ecosystem-based management for the northern Peruvian sea
   and the conservation of these highly exploited, threatened or poorly
   understood group of predators in one of the most productive marine
   ecosystems.}},

Title = {{A panel path analysis approach to the determinants of coronavirus
   disease 2019 transmission: does testing matter for confirmed cases?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES}},
Abstract = {{Purpose The main purpose of this study is to examine the role of the
   coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) test on transmission data globally
   to reveal the fact that the actual picture of transmission history
   cannot be exposed if the countries do not perform the test adequately.
   Design/methodology/approach Using Our World in Data for 212 countries
   and areas and 162 time periods daily from December 31, 2019, to June 09,
   2020, on an unbalanced panel framework, we have developed a panel-based
   path analysis model to explore the interdependence of various actors of
   COVID-19 cases of transmission across the globe. After controlling for
   per capita gross domestic product (GDP), age structure and government
   stringency, we explore the proposition that COVID-19 tests affect
   transmission positively. As an anecdote, we also explore the direct,
   indirect and total effects of different potential determinants of
   transmission cases worldwide and gather an idea about each factor's
   relative role in a structural equation framework. Findings Using the
   panel path model, we find that a 1 standard deviation change in the
   number of tests results in a 0.70 standard deviation change in total
   cases per million after controlling for several variables like per
   capita GDP, government stringency and age population (above 65).
   Research limitations/implications It is not possible to get balanced
   data of COVID-19 for all the countries for all the periods. Similarly,
   the socioeconomic, political and demographic variables used in the model
   are not observed daily, and they are only available on an annual basis.
   Practical implications Countries which cannot afford to carry out more
   tests are also the countries where transmission rates are suppressed
   downward and negatively manipulated. Social implications Cross country
   collaboration in terms of COVID-19 test instruments, vaccination and
   technology transfer are urgently required. This collaboration may be
   sought as an alternative to foreign development assistance.
   Originality/value This article provides an alternative approach to
   modeling COVID-19 transmission through the panel path model where the
   test is considered as an endogenous determinant of transmission, and the
   endogeneity has been channeled through per capita GDP, government
   stringency and age structure without using any regression-based modeling
   like pooled ordinary least squares (OLS), fixed-effects, two-stage least
   squares or generalized method of moments (GMM). Endogeneity has been
   handled without using any instruments.}},

Abstract = {{Magnesium isotopic analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a
   potentially interesting approach for studies on neurodegeneration.
   However, this type of analysis is challenging because of the
   invasiveness of the sampling and small sample volume. In this work, a
   novel analytical method was developed for ultrasensitive Mg isotopic
   analysis of CSF microsamples via multicollector inductively coupled
   plasma-mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) using high-gain 10(13) Omega
   Faraday cup amplifiers. The intermediate and internal errors on the
   delta Mg-26 value were improved up to fourfold using 10(13) Omega
   resistors for the monitoring of both the Mg-24 and Mg-26 isotopes and up
   to twofold using a 10(11) Omega resistor for the most abundant Mg-24
   isotope and a 10(13) Omega resistor for the Mg-26 isotope. Magnesium
   isotope ratios measured at a concentration level of 7-10 mu g L-1 were
   in good agreement with those obtained using the conventional method at a
   concentration level of 150 mu g L-1. The expanded uncertainty for the
   quality control CSF material obtained at the ultratrace level was +/-
   0.16 parts per thousand. Ultrasensitive Mg isotopic analysis was carried
   out for CSF from hydrocephalus patients using only 5 mu L of sample.
   delta Mg values thus obtained were not significantly different from
   those obtained using the conventional method using a sample volume of
   400 mu L instead (p <= 0.05). The Mg isotopic composition of the CSF
   from hydrocephalus patients ranged between -0.65 and 0.30 parts per
   thousand, with a mean delta Mg-26 value of -0.14 +/- 0.27 parts per
   thousand.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution and abundance of polyploids has intrigued biologists
   since their discovery in the early 20th century. A pattern in nature
   that may give insight to processes that shape the distribution and
   abundance of polyploids is that polyploid populations are sometimes
   associated with peripheral habitats within the range of a species of
   mixed ploidy. Here, adaptation and competition of a diploid versus an
   autotetraploid population in a peripheral habitat are examined
   theoretically. It is shown that a nascent autotetraploid population
   adapts to and outcompetes a diploid population in the periphery when the
   rate of gamete dispersal is high, and when the mode of gene action is
   recessive for moderate to high rates of selfing. With additive or
   dominant modes of gene action, the conditions for an autotetraploid to
   outcompete a diploid in the periphery appear determined more by the rate
   of selfing and less by gamete dispersal. All of these results are based
   on empirical work that suggests inbreeding depression is higher in
   diploids versus autotetraploids. Generally, the results indicate that,
   although autotetraploids incur minority cytotype exclusion, diploids
   face burdens themselves. In the case of adaptation to a peripheral
   habitat, this burden is migration load from gamete and propagule
   dispersal.}},

Abstract = {{Turkey is located in a highly active earthquake zone. Many geodynamic
   and seismic activities occur during a day, such as earthquakes,
   landslides, sinkholes and creep movements. In addition to seismicity,
   Turkey has unique physical features like being surrounded by seas on
   three sides, affected by different climate types. It is located on mid
   latitudes, which makes Turkey very suitable for atmospheric studies. For
   this reason, Turkey serves as a natural laboratory for geodesy,
   geophysical and atmospheric scientists. Therefore, Global Navigation
   Satellite System (GNSS) data are used in many areas. However, not all
   the scientists can reach or process the data for coordinate-based
   studies. Within the scope of the study, a GNSS-based Earth Crust and
   Atmosphere Monitoring Service is established at the Zonguldak Bulent
   Ecevit University. Using the results of the GNSS processing, time series
   of GNSS station positions are produced and used to infer strain
   solutions related to earthquakes. Estimates of the Precipitable Water
   Vapour (PWV) and the Total Electron Content (TEC) in the ionosphere are
   made available for tropospheric and ionospheric studies, respectively.
   Visualisation of the results are intended to be provided to the
   scientific community. Results show that the root mean square (RMS)
   differences of the PWV between GNSS and radiosondes are in the range of
   1-3 mm. RMS differences of the TEC is in the range of 2-3 TEC units when
   comparing our GNSS estimates with the Global Ionospheric Maps (GIM) from
   the International GNSS Service (IGS). One of the main results obtained
   from the analysis centre is near real-time strain rates and their
   relations to actual earthquakes. Results show that near real-time strain
   rates can be assessed as a precursor parameter for earthquakes. (c) 2020

Abstract = {{In this study, two grades of high speed steel (HSS), having different
   carbon content and processing treatment (i.e. cryo-milling and
   atomization), were used as a metallic binder for NbC cemented carbides.
   Thermoanalytical methods were used to investigate the outgassing and
   sintering of the two NbC cemented carbides during heat treatment. For
   this mean, thermogravimetry (TG), differential scanning calorimetry
   (DSC) and evolved gas (EG) analysis during thermal heat treatment were
   carried out. The results indicated that the processing treatment has a
   great impact on the thermal behavior of the steel powders, which later
   can be traced in the thermal behavior of the compacts. Higher
   decarburization was traced during the thermal analysis on the powder
   prepared via cryo-milling compared to the one made by the atomization
   process. From the TG analysis of the green compacts, it was evident that
   intensive outgassing occurs at temperatures above 850 degrees C. This
   phenomenon is associated with the activation of several mechanism in NbC
   and steel above this temperature which was realized from the evaluation
   of the initial powders. To gain a deeper understanding on the basic
   reactions and the effect of carbon content on phase transformations
   during the thermal process, thermodynamic studies was performed using
   commercial software (Thermo-Calc). It was evident that decreasing the
   carbon content shifts the transformation temperatures (e.g. liquid
   formation) to higher levels. This is especially important in adjusting
   the sintering temperature in NbC-high speed steel system as sufficient
   portion of liquid phase should be presented during the sintering process
   in order to obtain a satisfactory sintering.}},

Abstract = {{Although copper is an effective heat-dissipation material, a material
   with a higher thermal conductivity is required to meet the demands of
   future electronics. Carbon materials (CMs) are of great interest owing
   to their excellent thermal conductivities; however, it is difficult to
   apply CMs individually because of their brittleness and low formability.
   CM/copper composites are expected to overcome these drawbacks. Diamond
   is of special interest for preparing composites because they do not
   require control of orientation owing to their isotropic thermal
   conductivity, but unfortunately, diamond and copper generally show poor
   interfacial adhesion. Therefore, designing an interface to improve their
   adhesion is essential to realizing high thermal conductivity. In this
   study, SiC-coated diamonds were adopted to fabricate diamond/copper
   composite platings by electro-deposition for the first time.
   Electrodeposition was carried out in a copper sulfate bath containing
   pristine and SiC-coated diamonds. The formation of SiC slightly
   decreased the current efficiency but did not significantly affect the
   diamond content of the plating. The sample with the nano-diamond/copper
   composite plating containing 1.07 mass\% (2.72 vol\%) of SiC-coated
   nano-diamonds exhibited a thermal conductivity 46 Wm(-1) K-1 higher than
   that of the sample with pure copper plating. From observations of the
   diamond/copper interface using micron-sized diamonds as a model, an
   obvious gap was observed between the diamonds and the copper when using
   pristine diamonds, whereas no gaps were observed when using the
   SiC-coated diamonds. SiC formation significantly improved the adhesion
   between the diamonds and copper. In addition, copper was directly
   deposited onto the surfaces of the SiC-coated diamonds in contrast to
   pristine diamonds, which showed no sign of deposition.}},

Abstract = {{Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is a highly contagious and notifiable
   avian disease leading to grave economic losses in the poultry industry.
   Although the immune responses against NDV have been widely investigated,
   little is known regarding the virus interaction with the host innate
   immune responses. In this study, we tested the effect of different
   commercially applied Newcastle disease vaccines as well as virulent NDV
   genotype VIId on the expression pattern of the upstream regulator and
   downstream effector genes related to chicken interferon-alpha (chIFN
   alpha) signalling transduction pathway. Using quantitative real-time PCR
   analysis, mild transient induction of chIFN alpha-inducible genes was
   detected in bird spleen 72 h post-vaccination (hpv) with either live
   LaSota (respiratory) or VG/GA (enteric) strains. Vaccination with the
   enteric VG/GA strain led to stimulation of the investigated pathway as
   early as 24 hpv which continued up to 7 days in bird caecal tonsils.
   Subcutaneous injection with inactivated LaSota oil adjuvant-based
   vaccine led to continual stimulation of the investigated pathway up to 7
   days post-vaccination (dpv). The recombinant herpesvirus of turkey
   (rHVT) - NDV vaccine led to remarkable stimulation of all the tested
   cytokines up to 17 dpv in comparison with LaSota and VG/GA NDV vaccines.
   Stronger but transient activation of all the tested cytokines was
   detected in spleens during the first 24 h post-challenge with virulent
   NDV (vNDV) which reduced gradually and diminished later due to the
   virus-induced lymphocytic depletion. This study will aid in the
   discovery of new approaches to control NDV.}},

Abstract = {{Composting is a microbiological process that converts organic waste into
   organic soil amendment. We reveal enhanced biodiversity and microbial
   population with subsequent enhancement of composting efficiency of
   lignocellulosic waste using thermoacidophilic effective microorganisms
   (tEM). Composting with tEM + shading (tEMA) or tEM without shading
   (tEMB) increased the average microbial population by 12.0\% or 6.7\%,
   respectively compared to non-tEM composting without shading/control (C).
   The biodiversity in tEMA or tEMB treated groups was increased by 34.7\%
   or 43.7\%, respectively, compared to C. The highest increase in
   population (31.7\% and 9.4\%) and diversity (91.2\% and 91.6\%) were
   observed in tEMA and tEMB at 30 d, respectively. Regarding microbial
   structure, the most dominant phylum shifted from Proteobacteria to
   Bacteroidetes during composting. From 60 to 120 d, tEM notably improved
   the average abundance of Firmicutes (mainly Bacillus) by 166.7\% and
   75.8\% in tEMA and tEMB groups, respectively. The overall gradation rate
   of large compost granules (<2 mm) increased by 36.4\% and 24.7\%,
   following tEMA and tEMB treatment, respectively. The average rate of
   increase in bulk density was 42.6\% or 33.3\% by tEMA or tEMB,
   respectively, compared to C. We reveal the major differences in
   microbial structure, including a higher abundance of beneficial microbes
   like Bacillus in tEM treated composts. The study revealed that tEM could
   improve biodiversity and population of microbes, especially during
   thermophilic phase (above 45 degrees C), with a subsequent increase in
   composting rate, mineralization, and product quality. The results of
   this study are particularly invaluable in the areas of environmental
   conservation and organic agriculture.}},

   is a significant lack of research on the plant and biotechnological
   techniques are in their infancy. Developing and applying modern

   challenges to increase productivity and improve our knowledge about this
   plant. With regulatory environments relaxing in many parts of the world,
   there has been a significant increase in biotechnological research with
   this species. The current manuscript reviews the advances in Cannabis
   biotechnology, including molecular markers, microRNA, omics-based
   methods, and functional genes related to the terpene and cannabinoid
   biosynthesis as well as fiber quality. The foremost aim of this study is
   to a comprehensive review of the available literature to guide future
   cannabis studies in the field of genetic engineering and biotechnology.}},

Title = {{Sampling insulin in different tissue compartments using microdialysis:
   methodological aspects}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Sampling the concentration of insulin in human skin using microdialysis
   is challenging because of low intracutaneous concentrations and low
   recovery, presumably due to adsorption of insulin to the microdialysis
   system. In this study, we aimed to (1) measure how the concentration of
   insulin varies in three different tissue compartments (intracutaneous,
   subcutaneous and intravenous) and (2) to study how much insulin is
   adsorbed to the microdialysis catheter membranes and tubing during a
   typical microdialysis experiment, both in vivo and in vitro. We
   hypothesized that (1) the concentration of insulin decreases from the
   intravenous compartment to the intracutaneous and subcutaneous tissue,
   and that (2) adsorption of insulin to the microdialysis membrane and
   tubing impairs the recovery of insulin from the tissue. In this
   experimental study, microdialysis catheters were inserted
   intracutaneously, subcutaneously and intravenously in 11 healthy
   subjects. Systemic endogenous hyperinsulinemia was induced by intake of
   an oral glucose load. Insulin concentration was measured in the
   dialysate and in the extracted samples from the catheter membrane and
   tubings. In vitro microdialysis was performed to investigate the
   temporal resolution of the adsorption. After an oral glucose load
   insulin concentration increased intravenously, but not in the
   intracutaneous or subcutaneous compartments, while glucose, lactate and
   pyruvate concentrations increased in all compartments. The adsorption of
   insulin to the microdialysis membrane in vivo was highest in the
   intravenous compartment (p=0.01), compared to the intracutaneous and
   subcutaneous compartments. In vitro, the adsorption to the microdialysis
   membrane was highest one hour after sampling, then the concentration
   gradually decreased after three and five hours of sampling. The
   concentration of insulin in peripheral tissues is low, probably due to
   decreasing tissue vascularity. Adsorption of insulin to the
   microdialysis membrane is modest but time-dependent. This finding
   highlights the importance of a stabilization time for the microdialysis
   system before sampling tissue analytes.}},

Title = {{An experimental investigation into active structural acoustic cloaking
   of a flexible cylinder}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ACOUSTICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{170}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The ability to acoustically cloak an object, effectively making the
   object acoustically invisible to an outside observer, is of interest in
   many applications where the presence of an object has an undesirable
   impact on the sound-field. If a suitable disturbance signal can be
   measured, an active control system can be used to directly minimise the
   scattered acoustic pressure, which fully characterises the presence of
   the body. In this paper, a broadband feedforward active control system
   is used to minimise the scattered acoustic pressure at a far-field
   microphone array using an array of structural control sources affixed to
   the flexible scattering body. The performance of this system is assessed
   using measured data corresponding to a hollow cylindrical shell subject
   to an incident acoustic field, and the causality of the control filters
   is investigated. It is shown that the practical causality constraint
   limits the performance of the active cloak at lower frequencies, but the
   causally constrained controller is able to achieve approximately 10 dB
   of attenuation in the far-field scattered acoustic power, using an array
   of 9 control actuators. The influence that the number of control
   actuators has on the attenuation performance is investigated, the
   practicability of the system is discussed, and a number of potential
   implementation challenges are identified, including the increased level
   of structural vibration caused by the active structural acoustic
   cloaking system. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{TOXICOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{446}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Toluene intoxication produces deleterious effects on cognitive function,
   which has been associated with the inhibition of N-methyl-D-aspartate
   receptor (NMDAR). The present study determined whether
   N,N-dimethylglycine (DMG), a nutrient supplement and a partial agonist
   for NMDAR glycine binding site, could counteract recognition memory
   deficits and hippocampal synaptic dysfunction after acute toluene
   exposure. Male ICR mice were treated with toluene (250-750 mg/kg) for
   monitoring the sociability and social novelty in three-chamber test and
   long-term potentiation (LTP) of hippocampal synaptic transmission.
   Moreover, the combined effects of DMG (30-100 mg/kg) pretreatment with
   toluene (750 mg/kg) on three-chamber test, novel location and object
   recognition test and synaptic function were determined. Toluene
   decreased the sociability, preference for social novelty, hippocampal
   synaptic transmission and LTP in a dose-dependent manner. DMG
   pretreatment signifi-cantly reduced the toluene-induced memory
   impairment in social recognition, object location and object recognition
   and synaptic dysfunction. Furthermore, NMDAR glycine binding site
   antagonist, 7-chlorokynurenic acid, abolished the protective effects of
   DMG. These results indicate that DMG could prevent toluene-induced
   recognition memory deficits and synaptic dysfunction and its beneficial
   effects might be associated with modulation of NMDAR. These findings
   suggest that DMG supplementation might be an effective approach to
   prevent memory problems for the workers at risk of high-level toluene
   exposure or toluene abusers.}},

Title = {{Leveraging the water electrolysis reaction in bipolar electrophoresis to
   form robust and defectless chitosan films}},
Journal = {{CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{250}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Electrophoresis of chitosan and its composites are widely used to form a
   coating on selective substrates, but the parasitic water electrolysis
   causes structural defects that weaken the resulting film. In this work,
   we demonstrate a bipolar electrophoresis technique that leverages the
   water electrolysis to produce a chitosan film with less porosity and
   surface cavities. The process involves a negative bias to deposit the
   protonated chitosan molecules from the solution, followed by a positive
   bias to remove the entrapped hydrogen bubbles via the re-protonation of
   chitosan deposit. Since water electrolysis occurs for both positive and
   negative bias, the bipolar profile is designed to engender pH changeup
   near the electrode for ``surface conditioning{''} of chitosan film. The
   bipolar electrophoresis route demonstrates better coulomb efficiency
   than that of conventional potentiostatic electrophoresis, resulting in a
   free-standing chitosan film with sufficient mechanical strength and
   large area.}},

Abstract = {{Eddy current based approaches have been investigated for a wide range of
   inspection applications. Dodd-Deeds model and the truncated region
   eigenfunction expansion (TREE) method are widely applied in various
   occasions, mostly for the cases that the sample is relatively larger
   than the radius of the sensor coil. The TREE method converts the
   integral expressions to the summation of many terms in the truncated
   region. In a recent work, the impedance of the co-axial air-cored sensor
   due to a plate of finite radius was calculated by the modified
   Dodd-Deeds analytical approach proposed by authors. In this paper,
   combining the modified analytical solution and the TREE method, a new
   finite region eigenfunction expansion (FREE) method is proposed. This
   method involves modifying its initial summation point from the first
   zero of the Bessel function to a value related to the radius of the
   plate, therefore makes it suitable for plate with finite dimensions.
   Experiments and simulations have been carried out and compared for the
   verification of the proposed method. Further, the planar size
   measurements of the metallic circular plate can be achieved by utilising
   the measured peak frequency feature.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) is
   characterized by chronic pain in pelvic area and lower urinary tract
   symptoms (LUTS). Previous neuroimaging studies demonstrated that chronic
   pain was associated with the altered brain activity. However, the
   pathological mechanisms associated with altered brain control of CP/CPPS
   are not well-understood. Therefore, we sought to investigate the
   topological properties of white matter brain networks in patients with
   CP/CPPS and whether the topological configuration of frontal-parietal
   control network was disrupted. We collected 19 patients with CP/CPPS and
   32 matched healthy controls (HCs). Diffusion tensor imaging data of all
   participates were used to map the white matter structural networks.
   Graph theoretical method was applied to investigate the alterations of
   topological properties of brain network in patients. Moreover, we also
   investigated whether the alerted brain regions might be correlated with
   any clinical features of patients by the method of Pearson correlation
   analysis. Both CP/CPPS patients and HCs exhibited a `small-world'
   behavior or economical small-world architecture of the white matter
   brain networks. In addition, CP/CPPS had a lower global efficiency in
   the right middle frontal gyrus (orbital part) and a higher global
   efficiency in the left middle cingulate and paracingulate gyri. CP/CPPS
   also showed increased local efficiency in the left middle cingulate and
   paracingulate gyri and paracentral lobule. Moreover, the local
   efficiency of the left middle cingulate gyrus was positively correlated
   with the scores of the influence of symptoms on the quality of life. The
   local efficiency of the left precuneus and right supplementary motor
   area were positively correlated with the total scores of NIH-CPSI and
   the scores of pain and discomfort symptoms, respectively. Together, we
   found that patients with CP/CPPS had alterations of connections within
   the frontal-parietal control network, which suggested that the altered
   connectivity involved in the executive control processing procedures
   might contribute to the pathogenesis of the pelvic pain and LUTS in
   CP/CPPS. Thus these results provided new insights into the understanding
   of CP/CPPS.}},

Abstract = {{Intake of probiotics is associated with many health benefits, which has
   generated an interest in formulating viable probiotic supplements. The
   present study had two aims. The first aim was to achieve
   gastrointestinal protection and delayed release of viable probiotics by
   pelletizing and coating freeze-dried probiotic strains, using riboflavin
   as a marker for release. The second aim was to set up a dynamic
   three-step in vitro model simulating the conditions in the human
   gastric, duodenum/jejunum and ileum compartments using physiologically
   relevant media to evaluate delayed release of the formulations. To
   simulate lowered bile acid concentrations in the ileum area of the
   gastrointestinal tract, a novel method using the bile acid sequestrant
   cholestyramine to lower bile acid concentrations in the small intestinal
   medium to physiologically relevant levels was attempted. Granulation,
   extrusion and spheronization was used to develop pellets containing
   viable probiotics using freeze-dried Lactobacullus reuteri as a model
   strain. Fluid bed coating the pellets with the pH-sensitive polymers
   Eudragit S100 or Eudragit FS30D resulted in targeted release in the
   ileum step of the three-step in vitro model based on release of the

Title = {{Distributed fault diagnosis of rotor-bearing system using dimensional
   analysis and experimental methods}},
Journal = {{MEASUREMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{166}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Distributed defects in rolling element bearing arise due to the
   progression of small localized pits. If not monitored on time, this
   leads to premature or may turn into catastrophic failure of a rotor
   system and thus increases the cost of maintenance of machinery in
   industries. This research work introduced a novel method for the
   diagnosis of rolling element bearings to detect distributed defects
   using Dimensional Analysis (DA). The rolling element bearing system is
   modeled using DA with Buckingham's theorem to study the vibration
   characteristics theoretically. Significant geometrical and response
   parameters are considered for modeling the rotor-bearing system. The
   in-house experimental test rig is designed and fabricated to study the
   vibration characteristics of distributed defects experimentally.
   Geometrical imperfections are created intentionally on the bearings
   surfaces using electro-discharge machining and vibration signatures
   generated are studied under different operating conditions. Experimental
   results are compared with analytical models developed using the DA. A
   comparison is made between distributed and localized defects and
   vibrations signatures from both are correlated with healthy bearings. It
   is noticed that there is a good correlation between theoretical and
   experimental results. The present study contributes as a simple and
   effective diagnosis of rolling element bearings for distributed defects
   and useful for condition monitoring of industrial machinery. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{Background
   The aim of the study is to evaluate the performance of emergency
   departments in hospitals affiliated to Urmia University of Medical
   Sciences following the implementation of Specialist Residency Program as
   a part of the Health Transformation Plan.
   Methods
   This is an applied type and descriptive-analytic study. The data related
   to performance indicators of publics in Iran were collected through
   forms for 2six-month periods before and after implementation of
   Specialist Residency Program analyzed with Repeated Measure ANOVA test
   using SPSS 18. The interview data were analyzed using MAXQDA 10 and
   framework analysis technique.
   Results
   The execution of Specialist Residency resulted in relative improvement
   of performance indicators such as `mean time of triage (level 1)' (0.17
   min decrease) and `the percentage of patients released in 6hours'
   (1.36\% increase, p-value > 0.05). Results of the interviews showed that
   the factors that affect the overall improvement of ED performance
   include the permanent presence of emergency's, management method in
   emergency department, patient triage and counseling methods, providing
   necessary facilities and physical spaces, training classes for staff
   members, availability of diagnostic facilities and personnel motivation.
   Conclusions
   Appropriate implementation of the Specialist Residency Program results
   in improvement of performance indicators in Emergency Departments.
   Meanwhile, physicians' motivation is a requirement for successful
   implementation of this program.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{188}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a progressive damage model was proposed to predict the
   flexural behavior of pultruded fibre-reinforced composite (PFRC). The
   model consists of the 3D strain-based damage criteria, the cohesive
   model and the damage evolution model, which has been validated by
   experiment with acoustic emission technology. The dominated failure mode
   and the damage evolution of PFRC were clarified. The predicted flexural
   elastic modulus, flexural strength, damage modes and the damage
   evolution by the proposed model agree much better to the experimental
   results than the existing model. It is found that the damage of the PFRC
   includes three stages: the undamaged elastic stage, the damage
   initiation stage dominated by the matrix damage and delamination, the
   damage propagation stage including the fibre damage, the matrix damage
   and the delamination. The tensile matrix damage and delamination
   occurred first before the peak load, followed by the tensile fibre
   damage. The distributions of each damage modes are similar for each
   layer. The outer layer of glass/epoxy damaged worst, and followed by the
   middle layer of the wound glass/epoxy and the internal layer of
   carbon/epoxy.}},

Journal = {{MEASUREMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{166}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{In order to eliminate vibration harmonic interference and solve the
   measurement problem of the co-frequency signal that the flow signal and
   vibration interference are at the same or similar frequency, a signal
   processing method combining frequency variance with amplitude feature is
   proposed for the vortex flowmeter with a single piezoelectric sensor.
   The method uses multiple peak frequencies to calculate the frequency
   variance, and then rapidly outputs the frequency of the flow signal. The
   ratio of the spectral amplitude to the dynamic cut-off amplitude is used
   as an auxiliary criterion to eliminate vibration harmonic interference.
   The maximum difference among spectral amplitudes of the co-frequency
   signal is used to solve the measurement problem of the co-frequency
   signal. A low-power and two-wire vortex flowmeter system was developed,
   and the gas calibration experiment and anti-vibration experiment were
   performed to validate the effectiveness and measurement accuracy of the
   anti-vibration method. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the authors propose robust automatic modulation

   identify features directly from a received signal when appropriately
   trained. They trained the classifier by taking the magnitude, phase,
   real, and imaginary parts of the received signal for CNN-based automatic
   modulation classification, which is insensitive to phase and frequency
   deviation. Also, in order to make the proposed classifier more robust,
   they generated signal-to-noise ratio, phase offset, and frequency offset
   in the training signal set. They compared the proposed methods with
   conventional automatic modulation classification methods using
   higher-order cumulants, order statistics, and a CNN-based method. The
   simulation results show that the proposed methods outperform the
   conventional methods not only in the additive white Gaussian noise

Title = {{A multifunctional honeycomb metastructure for vibration suppression}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{188}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{In this study, a multifunctional metastructure is proposed for vibration
   suppression by combining a honeycomb sandwich structure and a locally
   resonant metastructure. To localize the low-frequency bandgaps, an
   analytical model based on Hamilton's principle and the energy averaging
   technique is developed and is confirmed by a three-dimensional numerical
   simulation. Moreover, the effective mass density is determined
   analytically to give a physical insight into the wave control mechanism.
   Then, the dynamic behavior of the finite structure is investigated
   analytically. A finite element (FE) simulation and experimental
   measurements are performed to demonstrate the validity and accuracy of
   this dynamic model. Results show that the proposed metastructure
   exhibits an excellent vibration suppression performance, as well as a
   significant tunability. Furthermore, to claim multifunctionality, the
   out-of-plane compression behavior is analyzed experimentally.
   Experimental results indicate that mechanical properties of the proposed
   metastructure are significantly improved in comparison with a
   traditional square honeycomb sandwich structure. The proposed strategy
   is a novel multi-functional combination, which can help realize
   vibration control and high mechanical efficiency. This will
   significantly impact multiple research areas in vibration analysis and
   provide engineering applications.}},

Abstract = {{Quantum chemical computations of monomer and dimer molecules of
   para-Iodoaniline (p-IA) and para-Bromoaniline (p-BA) were performed at
   best suitable DFT/WB97XD levels of theory using LANL2DZ basis set
   through Gaussian 09 program in addition to experimental z-scan and
   spectroscopic characterization. Molecular structure analysis reveals
   halogen/hydrogen bonded interactions such as N-H center dot center dot
   center dot X, C-X center dot center dot center dot N and C-H center dot
   center dot center dot N as well as pi - pi stacked intermolecular
   interactions to form the dimer with high binding energy (28.2979 kJ/mol)
   and stability. The order of planarity p-IA> p-BA is also identified. NBO
   predicts that the strength of intermolecular interaction in p-IA >p-BA
   and intramolecular interaction in p-BA >p-IA. The FT-IR and FT-Raman
   spectra also supports greater planarity and intermolecular interactions
   in p-IA compared to p-BA. The presence of higher pi{*}(C-15 -C-16 )
   pi{*} (C-2 -C-3) stacked intermolecular interaction energy (20.18
   kJ/mol) enhances the NLO activity of p-IA. The FMO's and NBO analyses
   predict the delocalization of electrons within the phenyl ring of the
   molecules due to the strong ICT interaction between the lone pair of N
   and pi(C-C) orbitals at high stabilization energy. Hirshfeld surface map
   and 2D fingerprint plot analysis confirm the stability and interactions
   within the compounds. First order hyperpolarizability values
   corresponding to p-IA and p-BA were computed which are 5.1 and 3.6 times
   that of urea. Third order optical nonlinearity was measured by the means
   of the open aperture z-scan technique .The calculated values of 2PA
   coefficient beta =4.3 x 10(-11) m/W in p-IA and beta =2.4 x 10(-11) m/W
   in p-BA reveal that the p-IA is a better optical limiter than p-BA

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: The present study explores the effect of visual art training
   on people with dementia, utilizing a randomized control trial design, in
   order to investigate the effects of an 8-week visual art training
   program on cognition. In particular, the study examines overall
   cognition, delayed recall, and working memory, which show deficits in
   people with dementia.
   Method: Fifty-three individuals with dementia were randomly assigned
   into either an art training (n = 27) or usual-activity waitlist control
   group (n = 26). Overall cognition and delayed recall were assessed with
   the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and working memory was
   assessed with the Backward Digit Span task.
   Results: There were no group differences in overall cognition, or
   working memory, while a difference in delayed recall was undetermined,
   based on post-test-pre-test difference scores. Groups were comparable at
   baseline on all measures.
   Conclusion: The measures of cognition, delayed recall, and working
   memory used in this study were not affected by an 8-week visual art
   training program.}},

Abstract = {{A comparable study of the dielectric response of PentylCyano Biphenyl
   (PCB) nematic liquid crystals over the temperature range 297-316 degrees
   K is reported for two frequencies i.e. 9.0 GHz and 20.9 GHz. The loaded
   resonant microwave cavity operated in TM010 mode at two different
   frequencies mentioned above. The theory of perturbation is used to
   analyze the data. The computation of Activation energy and Relaxation
   time was done. Calculation for the thermo-dynamical parameters such as
   Delta G, Delta H and Delta S was done for a suitable temperature range.
   It has been observed that the change in temperature and the change in
   frequency both effects the properties such as relaxation time,
   activation energy, entropy and enthalpy. This method is well known in
   scientific community for its requirement of small quantity of sample and
   inherent accuracy. The possible applications are reversible optical
   memories, beam steering antenna, and fabricating frequency agile
   components. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   significant advantages over the standard reduced-order Galerkin

Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{213}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{This study investigates the performance of a hybrid passive cooling
   system that combines a hydronic radiative cooling (RC) panel integrated
   with a cross -flow dew-point indirect evaporative cooler DPIEC equipped
   with a closed cycle water reclamation using air-water harvesting (AWH)
   system. The study was performed on a typical residential house located
   in the hot and mostly dry climate of Kuwait. The house hourly cooling
   load was calculated using the transient simulation software TRNSYS. A
   mathematical model integrating the hydronic RC panel and the DPIEC
   models was developed and simulated to predict the system operation over
   the cooling season. The integrated hybrid system's performance was
   compared with two systems: i) the DPIEC unit standalone, and ii) the
   conventional cooling system, while focusing on the role of the RC
   system.
   It was found that the use of the RC panel's power during nighttime and
   daytime reduced the water consumption of the DPIEC unit by an average of
   44.2\% in comparison to that of a DPIEC unit operating alone during the
   cooling season. Moreover, a significant reduction of 53.4\% in the
   electrical energy consumption was achieved by hybrid system compared to
   a typical AC system during the entire cooling season in Kuwait. (C) 2020

Title = {{Differential responses of murine alveolar macrophages to elongate
   mineral particles of asbestiform and non-asbestiform varieties:
   Cytotoxicity, cytokine secretion and transcriptional changes}},
Journal = {{TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{409}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Human exposures to asbestiform elongate mineral particles (EMP) may lead
   to diffuse fibrosis, lung cancer, malignant mesothelioma and autoimmune
   diseases. Cleavage fragments (CF) are chemically identical to
   asbestiform varieties (or habits) of the parent mineral, but no
   consensus exists on whether to treat them as asbestos from toxicological
   and regulatory standpoints. Alveolar macrophages (AM) are the first
   responders to inhaled particulates, participating in clearance and
   activating other resident and recruited immunocompetent cells, impacting
   the long-term outcomes. In this study we address how EMP of asbestiform
   versus non-asbestiform habit affect AM responses. Max Planck Institute
   (MPI) cells, a non-transformed mouse line that has an AM phenotype and
   genotype, were treated with mass-, surface area(s.a.), and particle
   number(p.n.) equivalent concentrations of respirable asbestiform and
   non-asbestiform riebeckite/tremolite EMP for 24 h. Cytotoxicity,
   cytokines secretion and transcriptional changes were evaluated. At the
   equal mass, asbestiform EMP were more cytotoxic, however EMP of both
   habits induced similar LDH leakage and decrease in viability at s.a. and
   p.n. equivalent doses. DNA damage assessment and cell cycle analysis
   revealed differences in the modes of cell death between asbestos and
   respective CF. There was an increase in chemokines, but not
   pro-inflammatory cytokines after all EMP treatments. Principal component
   analysis of the cytokine secretion showed close clustering for the s.a.
   and p.n. equivalent treatments. There were mineraland habit-specific
   patterns of gene expression dysregulation at s.a. equivalent doses. Our
   study reveals the critical nature of EMP morphometric parameters for
   exposure assessment and dosing approaches used in toxicity studies.}},

Abstract = {{Critical micelle concentration (cmc) is a key parameter of generally
   used surfactants, and many experimental techniques like tensiometry,
   conductivity, spectrophotometry, fluorometry, etc. for its determination
   have been reported. However, these contemporary methods for cmc
   determination are tedious, are time-consuming, are sensitive, and
   require sophisticated instrumentation. Herein, we demonstrate that the
   cmc of the surfactants can be estimated via monitoring the variation in
   the apparent weight of a density bottle floating in a surfactant
   solution as a function of surfactant concentration. The proposed method
   requires the use of a simple weighing balance; a cost-affordable
   instrument always available in scientific laboratories. The proposed
   method is simple to execute and does not require any complicated data
   analysis procedures. As an experimental proof attached to the claim, we
   demonstrate the estimation of the cmcs of all types of surfactants,
   viz., anionic, cationic, and nonionic, through the formulated method.
   The results obtained in terms of cmc values of the chosen surfactants
   closely match those reported through the use of different standardized
   protocols. The formulated experimental protocol is desirable in terms of
   the simplicity of the protocol, accuracy, and reproducibility of the
   results, and cost and accessibility of the required instrument. All
   these attributes of the presented protocol qualify it as an appropriate
   substitute to the modern techniques commonly used for the cmc
   determination.}},

Title = {{Carbon dioxide balance of an oil palm plantation established on tropical
   peat}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{295}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Oil palm plantations have been expanding in recent decades in Indonesia
   and Malaysia. Carbon-rich tropical peat swamp forest has not been
   excluded from this expansion, because it was the last frontier suitable
   for industrial agriculture and more accessible than other undeveloped
   areas. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emission through accelerated peat
   decomposition is one of the main environmental concerns in the
   conversion of peatlands into plantations, which undergo drainage to
   increase palm growth rates and production. Changes in aboveground
   biomass might also significantly alter the CO2 exchange dynamics of the
   ecosystem. Despite the potential changes in CO2 balance due to land
   conversion, so far no study has been conducted using the eddy covariance
   technique about the CO2 balance of oil palm plantations established on
   peat. We have monitored the eddy CO2 flux above an oil palm plantation
   on peat in Sarawak, Malaysia since 2011. During the period from 2011 to
   2014 (four years), the plantation at 7-10 years of age was a large
   stable CO2 source with an annual net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) of 994
   +/- 158 g C m(-2) yr(-1). The NEE was much more positive than that of a
   peat swamp forest (-136 +/- 51 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) in the same region
   during the same period. The large positive NEE was caused mainly by its
   relatively small gross primary production (GPP) (2529 +/- 125 g C m(-2)
   yr(-1)) due to low leaf area index resulting from high palm mortality.
   In addition, a large amount of plant debris left in the plantation
   probably contributed to the large NEE through decomposition, especially
   under the many canopy gaps due to high palm mortality mainly caused by
   toppling on poorly compacted peat. Adequate peat compaction is essential
   to reduce the mortality rate.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional electrospun membranes are composed of nanofibers arranged
   packed together with limited porosity akin to a two-dimensional (2D)
   sheet in which the growth of cells is restricted on the surface. In this
   study, we report a three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical multilayer
   scaffold with additional functionality by the modified gas-foaming
   technique. Calcium hydroxide particles were in-situ deposited on the
   fiber surface throughout the layers of macroporous 3D scaffold by the
   sodium borohydride (NaBH4) reduction of calcium salt. Mechanical
   properties and biocompatibility of the conventional electrospun mat were
   enhanced by the underlying 3D multilayer structure and incorporation of
   calcium hydroxide particles. Besides, the expanded 3D nanofiber scaffold
   with calcium incorporation promoted cellular infiltration,
   mineralization and osteogenesis. This integrated 3D multilayer structure
   and additional functionality approach may advance the development of 2D
   electrospun based scaffolds for biomedical applications.}},

Title = {{Effective Use of Mobile Electronic Medical Records by Medical Interns in
   Real Clinical Settings: Mixed Methods Study}},
Journal = {{JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Background: In South Korea, most graduated medical students undertake a
   1-year internship before beginning residency and specialization. Interns
   usually work in a tertiary hospital and rotate between different,
   randomly assigned departments to be exposed to different medical
   specialties. Their jobs are mostly simple and repetitive but are still
   essential for the patient care process. However, owing to the lack of
   experience and overwhelming workload, interns at tertiary hospitals in
   South Korea are usually inefficient, often delaying the entire clinical
   process. Health care providers have widely adopted mobile electronic
   medical records (mEMRs) as they have been shown to improve workflow
   efficiency.
   Objective: This study investigates the association between the frequency
   of mEMR usage and the clinical task completion interval time among
   interns in a tertiary hospital.
   Methods: This mixed methods study was conducted at the Samsung Medical
   Center, Seoul, South Korea. Interns who worked at the Samsung Medical
   Center from March 2018 to February 2019 were included. The hospital
   electronic medical record (EMR) system known as DARWIN (Data Analysis
   and Research Window for Integrated kNowledge) was launched with PC and
   mobile. Both versions are actively used in hospitals by personnel in
   various positions. We collected the log data from the mEMR server and
   the intern clinical task time-series data from the EMR server. Interns
   can manage the process of identifying patients, assigning the clinical
   task, finishing the requested clinical intern tasks, etc, through the
   use of the mEMR system. We compared the clinical task completion
   interval among 4 groups of interns divided by the mEMR frequency
   quantile. Then, System Usability Score (SUS) questionnaires and
   semistructured interviews were conducted.
   Results: The regular mEMR users were defined as those who logged in more
   than once a day on average and used the mEMR until the level after
   login. Among a total of 87 interns, 84 used the mEMR to verify the
   requested clinical tasks. The most frequently used item was ``Intern
   task list.{''} Analysis of the 4 intern groups revealed an inverse
   relationship between the median time of the task completion interval and
   the frequency of mEMR use. Correlation analysis showed that the intern
   task completion time interval had a significant inverse relationship
   with the individual frequency of mEMR usage (coefficient=-0.27; 95\% CI
   -0.46 to -0.04; P=.02). In the additional survey, the mean SUS value was
   81.67, which supported the results of the data analysis.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that frequent mEMR use is associated
   with improved work efficiency in hospital interns with good usability of
   the mEMR. Such finding supports the idea that the use of mEMR improves
   the effectiveness and workflow efficiency of interns working in
   hospitals and, more generally, in the context of health care.}},

Title = {{Competing effects of potassium hydroxide activation of graphene on
   gravimetric and volumetric capacitances}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{479}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Potassium hydroxide (KOH)-activated graphene is actively investigated as
   an electrode material with high gravimetric capacitance for electrical
   double-layer capacitors. However, extremely low density (<< 0.1 g
   cm(-3)) of activated graphene and the resulting low volumetric
   capacitance severely limit its practical applications. Despite its
   critical importance to volumetric capacitance, however, material density
   of activated graphene has barely been previously discussed. In this
   study, we comprehensively investigate material density, compressive
   strength, gravimetric capacitance, and volumetric capacitance of
   KOH-activated graphene microspheres (A-GMs). Competing effects of KOH
   activation are clearly observed for the material density and gravimetric
   capacitance. For the A-GMs treated using GMs/KOH mixtures in ratios of
   1:3-1:12, the gravimetric capacitance increases from 209.6 F g(-1) for
   GMs to 320.5 F g(-1) in organic electrolyte. However, the material
   density diminishes from 0.91 g cm(-3) for GMs to 0.47 g cm(-3) with a
   concomitant decrease in volumetric capacitance from 190.7 F cm(-3) to
   150.6 F cm(-3). Notably, volumetric capacitance reaches the highest
   value of 201.3 F cm(-3) for the A-GMs activated with a GMs/KOH mixture
   (1:6), demonstrating that a balance of material density and gravimetric
   capacitance is of critical importance for high volumetric capacitance of
   A-GMs.}},

Abstract = {{The quality of an image is limited to the signal-to-noise ratio of the
   output from sensors. As the background noise increases much more than
   the signal, which can be caused by either a huge attenuation of light
   pulses after a longhaul transmission or a blinding attack with a strong
   flood illumination, an imaging system stops working properly. Here we
   built a superconducting single-photon infrared camera of negligible dark
   counts and 60 ps timing resolution. Combining with an adaptive 3D
   slicing algorithm that gives each pixel an optimal temporal window to
   distinguish clustered signal photons from a uniformly distributed
   background, we successfully reconstructed. 3D single-photon images at
   both a low signal level (similar to 1 average photon per pixel) and
   extremely high noise background (background-to-signal ratio = 200 within
   a period of 50 ns before denoising). Among all detection events, we were
   able to remove 99.45\% of the noise photons while keeping the signal
   photon loss at 0.74\%. This Letter is a direct outcome of
   quantum-inspired imaging that asks for a co-development of sensors and
   computational methods. We envision that the proposed methods can
   increase the working distance of a long-haul imaging system or defend it
   from blinding attacks. (C) 2020 Optical Society of America}},

   assisted free radical polymerization process. A hybrid nanocomposite has
   also been made by incorporation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles into the kappa
   C-g-PHEAA network. The materials were characterized by FTIR, TGA, XRD,
   SEM, BET and VSM techniques. The nanocomposite exhibited
   superparamagnetic behavior. The.C-g-PHEAA and kappa C-g-PHEAA/Fe3O4
   presented significant adsorption capacity towards cationic dyes,
   methylene blue (MB) and rhodamine 6G(R6G); andmetal ions, Cu(II) and
   Hg(II) fromaqueous solution. The magnetite nanoparticles enhance the
   adsorption characteristics of the hydrogel and enables easy separation
   of the adsorbent with an external magnetic field. Adsorption process is
   observed to follow both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models for R6G
   and Freundlich isotherm model for MB, Cu(II) and Hg (II). The adsorption
   was found to be a pseudo first order process for MB and pseudo second
   order process for R6G, Cu(II) and Hg(II). Thermodynamic studies have
   shown the adsorption of dyes and metal ions to be spontaneous and
   endothermic in nature. The desorption studies revealed the efficient
   recovery of adsorbate species. The study indicates that the synthesized
   adsorbents have potential applications for the removal of dyes and metal
   ions from wastewater. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The present study is focussed on the interaction of Nucleic Acid Bases
   (NABs) with graphene (GNR) and boron nitride graphene (BNG). The Nucleic
   Acid Bases (NABs): Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G), Thymine (T)
   and Uracil (U) were made to interact with the pristine graphene (G) and
   boron nitride graphene (BNG) in two conformations i.e. in parallel and
   perpendicular mode. One of the most prominent applications of carbon
   based nanomaterials is DNA sequencing so in order to gain an insight
   upon the mechanism, it is very important to study their interaction with
   nucleic acid bases. The well established method B3LYP is employed to
   optimize the geometries which were followed by the single point energy
   calculations. It is clear from the present study that the order of the
   binding affinity of the NABs with the graphene are in good agreement
   with the experimental and computational studies accomplished in past.

Title = {{Comparison of Protective Effects of Recombinant Antithrombin Gamma and

   Coagulation and Multiple Organ Failure}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL AND APPLIED THROMBOSIS-HEMOSTASIS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{In Japan, the dose of the new recombinant antithrombin III concentrate
   (rAT-gamma) is titrated according to patient body weight (BW), while
   conventional plasma-derived antithrombin concentrates (AT) are
   administered as a fixed dose. Therefore, it is anticipated that
   rAT-gamma could produce better treatment effects than AT. The aim of
   this study was to compare the organ protective effects of doses of
   rAT-gamma and AT administered in clinical practice for septic
   disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and multiple organ failure.
   This study was performed at a single university hospital in Japan. A
   total of 49 patients with antithrombin deficiency secondary to septic
   DIC who were administered either rAT-gamma (n = 26) or AT (n = 23) were
   retrospectively analyzed to assess the dose of supplemental antithrombin
   concentrates, plasma antithrombin activity, Japanese Association for
   Acute Medicine (JAAM)-DIC score, and modified Sequential Organ Failure
   Assessment (SOFA) score on days 0, 3 and 6. The AT-equivalent dose per
   kg BW of rAT-gamma (equal to the initial rAT-gamma dose per kg BW
   divided by 1.2) was significantly higher than the dose per kg BW of AT
   (AT 23.4 +/- 5.1 vs. rAT 28.9 +/- 3.9 IU/kg/day; P < 0.001).
   Consequently, serial increases in plasma antithrombin levels occurred
   more rapidly in the rAT-gamma group (P = 0.036). JAAM DIC and modified
   SOFA scores revealed significantly greater improvement in the rAT versus
   the AT group (JAAM DIC score: P = 0.042, mSOFA score: P = 0.005). The
   results of this study suggest that AT supplementation adjusted for
   patient BW might further improve septic DIC and multiple organ failure.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of several anionic, cationic and non-ionic polyelectrolyte
   dispersants on the stability and rheology of aqueous boron carbide (B4C)
   suspensions were investigated using zeta potential measurements,
   settling experiments, and rheological studies. Zeta potential
   measurements and settling experiments were useful to narrow down the
   best pH range for each dispersant while using minimal amounts of
   material. However, these techniques did not effectively predict which
   dispersants would ultimately be the most effective. Slurry milling for
   2-4 h was essential to obtain stable homogeneous slurries (30-45 vol\%),
   while more viscous pastes (50 vol\%) would require longer milling times.
   The best concentration of each dispersant could be identified using
   rheological measurements. The viscosity of highly-loaded slurries
   containing the optimum concentration of each dispersant was compared,
   showing that cationic PEI 25 k was the most effective dispersing agent.
   The importance of average particle size and particle size dispersion was
   also demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a manufacturing method for the ribs of a
   cylindrical anisogrid composite structure without an outer skin. This
   research presents two direct compression techniques for the ribs during
   wet filament winding with T700 continuous carbon-fiber tows. In
   addition, the strength of the helical rib manufactured using the
   proposed compression process was compared to that of the manufactured
   rib that did not use the compression process. The average compressive
   strength of the helical rib manufactured using the proposed methods is
   394 Mpa and 247 MPa according to the failure mode, respectively.
   Although the ribs manufactured using the pro-posed method did not show
   increase in strength, decreases in the standard deviation for both
   compressive failure modes (66\% and 21\% of the structure made without
   the proposed compression method) and was observed. Thus, the proposed
   compression techniques resulted in compression strength stabilizing
   thanks to decreasing void content. Furthermore, structural stiffness was
   indirectly evaluated and it was found that the improvement was over
   150\%.}},

Title = {{Enhanced degradation of total petroleum hydrocarbons in real soil by
   dual-frequency ultrasound-activated persulfate}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{748}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Ultrasound (US) can be employed to activate persulfate (PS) for
   degrading total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH). In this study, to improve
   the degradation efficiency, PS is combined with dual-frequency US (DFUS)
   towards synergistic degradation of TPH in real soil. After 180 min, the
   degradation percentages for DFUS/PS, DFUS, highfrequency US and
   high-frequency US/PS are around 88.9\%, 38.7\%, 7.3\% and 54.2\%,
   respectively. Additionally, the influence of US power, PS content,
   slurry pH and temperature, and TPH components on the degradation
   percentage in the DFUS/PS process are explored. Scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) images and the results of specific surface area verify
   that the DFUS can break the soil aggregates more effectively than the
   single-frequency US, and thus enhance the TPH desorption and accelerate
   the oxidant diffusion. Moreover, the investigation of the mechanism is
   further evaluated through quenching and electron spinning resonance
   spectrum (ESR) tests. The results indicate that the generation of SO
   center dot(-)(4) and center dot OH in DFUS/PS is similar to 1.6 times
   and similar to 2.5 times as much, respectively, as in high frequency
   US/PS. The relative contributions to the synergistic TPH degradation in
   the DFUS/PS system are: SO center dot(-)(4) (PS activation via the heat
   induced by US) > pyrolysis inside the bubbles (hydrophobicity of TPH) >
   SO center dot(-)(4) (PS activation via US cavitation) > center dot OH.
   Finally, the hypothesis is confirmed via the evaluation of the
   degradation kinetics, which shows that the combined process of DFUS/PS
   is not a simple addition of the US and PS, but provides a highly
   effective process of synergistic degradation. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper presents a stochastic model predictive control method for
   linear time-invariant systems subject to state-dependent additive
   uncertainties modelled by Gaussian process (GP). The new method is
   developed by re-building the tube-based model predictive control
   framework with chance constraints via adaptive constraint tightening. In
   particular, the tightened constraint set is constructed by forecasting
   the confidence region of uncertainty. Utilising this adaptive strategy,
   the Gaussian process based stochastic model predictive control (GP-SMPC)
   algorithm is designed by applying the adaptive tightened constraints in
   all prediction horizons. To reduce the computation load, the one-step
   GP-SMPC algorithm is further developed by imposing the tightened
   constraints only to the first-step nominal state and the worst-case
   constraints to the remaining steps. Under the assumption that the
   state-dependent uncertainties are bounded, the recursive feasibility of
   the designed optimisation problem is ensured, and the closed-loop system
   stability is guaranteed. The effectiveness and advantage over existing
   methods are verified via simulation and comparison studies.}},

Abstract = {{Porous Al-doped ZnO/cellulose (AZOC) composites were successfully
   fabricated via a chemical deposition method. The micro-/nano cellulose
   fibers (MNCF) with tunable sizes were prepared by grinding treatment,
   and used as substrates for synthesizing ZnO/MNCF and AZOC composites.
   With the increasing of grinding treatment times, the average fiber
   diameter of MNCF decreased, that of MNCF-10, MNCF-20 and MNCF-30 were
   100 nm, 58 nm and 31 nm, which was observed by scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM). The fiber sizes of MNCF played an important role in
   the sizes of ZnO and Al-doped ZnO, also pore structures and
   photocatalytic properties of ZnO/MNCF and AZOC composites. The sizes of
   ZnO (or Al-doped ZnO) nanoparticles decreased with the de-creasing of
   MNCF diameter. The AZOC composite with average fiber diameter of 31 nm
   (under grinding treatment of 30 times) exhibited the highest porosity
   (94.6 \%). The obtained ZnO/MNCF and AZOC composites were further
   analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectrometry, X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and UV-vis diffuse reflectance
   spectroscopy (DRS). Due to the introduction of Al element dopant, the

   Otsu Method}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CIRCUITS SYSTEMS AND COMPUTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{15}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The one-dimensional Otsu method is an adaptive threshold method. It
   obtains the optimal threshold for image segmentation by the maximum
   between-class variance, without considering the minimum within-class
   variance. As the background of water surface image is mostly uniform,
   using this feature, the threshold selection tactics adopt the
   combination of the one-dimensional Otsu method and the uniformity
   measurement, proposes the threshold segmentation method based on
   uniformity measurement, and adopts the performance evaluation method
   based on GT image to compare the segmentation result. Experimental
   results demonstrate that effectiveness of the improved Otsu method is
   generally better than the traditional Otsu method, and the other four
   commonly used threshold segmentation methods for the water surface
   image, which improves the segmentation accuracy of such images and
   reduces the segmentation error rate. At the same time, as the water
   surface image is usually affected by light intensity, water ripple and
   other factors, this paper also adopts the relevant correction algorithm
   to further improve the segmentation accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Organic compounds of actinyls and their bonding features have attracted
   extensive attention in nuclear waste separation due to their
   characteristics of separating fission products. Herein, detailed studies
   on the binding sites of {[}AnO(2)(COOH)(n)(H2O)(m)](2-n) (An = U, Np,
   Pu, and Am; n = 1-3; m = 0, 2, 4; 2n + m = 6) complexes toward Cs are
   predicted by calculation, and their electronic excitation
   characteristics were illustrated, providing theoretical supports for the
   design of Cs adsorbents. The quantum theory of atom in molecules and
   electron localization function have been implemented to analyze the
   chemical bonding characterization. The covalent character of An-O(C
   )bonds become weaker with increasing COOH- ligands, and the covalent
   interaction in An-O-C bonds is more obvious than that in An-O-H bonds.
   Total and partial population density of state suggest that the 2p orbits
   of O have more significant contribution in the low-energy region atoms
   and the 6d/Sf orbits of An have more significant contribution in the
   high-energy region. The Cs+ best adsorption site on
   {[}UO2(COOH)(2)(H2O)(2)] and {[}UO2(COOH)(3)](-) is the adjacent
   oxalates, and the {[}UO2(COOH)(3)](-) complexes have better adsorption
   capacity. Besides, the electronic excitation characteristics of Cs+
   adsorption on the UO2(COOH)(2)(H2O)(2) complex were analyzed by the
   UV-vis spectrum and hole-electron distribution.}},

Title = {{Numerical simulation of polymer crystal growth under flow field using a
   coupled phase-field and lattice Boltzmann method}},
Journal = {{APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{387}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{In the present study, the polymer crystal growth under the flow field is
   numerically simulated by using a coupled phase field (PF) and lattice
   Boltzmann (LB) method. Firstly, the phase field method is presented to
   capture the growth interface of polymer crystals, including the common
   morphologies of spherulite and shish-kebab crystallites. Then the
   lattice Boltzmann method is introduced to solve the viscous
   non-Newtonian flows of the polymer melt, where the half-way bounce back
   boundary condition is imposed with the aid of shape level-set (LS)
   function which is used to represent the crystal interface at each time.
   At last, the crystal growth for spherulites and shish-kebab crystallites
   under flow field is simulated by using the coupled PF-LB method, where
   the crossWLF model is chosen to describe the melt viscosity. The effects
   of the flow velocity on the crystal morphologies, including single and
   multiple spherulite and shish-kebab crystallites, are analyzed in
   detail. The numerical results show that the flow velocity has an
   important impact on the crystal morphologies, and the crystals grow more
   faster towards the upstream direction, especially in the single and
   multi spherulites growth process. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Journal = {{OCEAN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{218}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{There are several numerical analyses for solving the hydrodynamic
   responses of a floating body in the time domain. Most of these provide a
   theoretical solution in the given irregular waves. However, the solution
   can be obtained only if accurate irregular waves represented by the wave
   spectrum are provided. Because we consider actual operation, we know
   that it is difficult to detect accurate irregular waves instantaneously
   as accuracy is required in most time-domain analyses for the control
   force feedback to the system. John V. Ringwood proposed a simple control
   method (SCM) for real-time control of wave energy converter. This paper
   improves the SCM to predict the practical wave force from the
   displacement of waves on a floating body in the time domain analysis
   almost instantaneously. The improved method, that can be applied to
   predict forces in the wave energy converter with a linear electric
   generator, helps us to select the control force for the higher
   conversion of electric power. We examined the control algorithm and
   confirmed its effectiveness for extensive wave conditions.}},

   Study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health burden.
   Self-management plays a key role in improving modifiable risk factors.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of
   wearable devices, a health management platform, and social media at
   improving the self-management of CKD, with the goal of establishing a
   new self-management intervention model.
   Methods: In a 90-day prospective experimental study, a total of 60
   people with CKD at stages 1-4 were enrolled in the intervention group
   (n=30) and control group (n=30). All participants were provided with
   wearable devices that collected exercise-related data. All participants
   maintained dietary diaries using a smartphone app. All dietary and
   exercise information was then uploaded to a health management platform.
   Suggestions about diet and exercise were provided to the intervention
   group only, and a social media group was created to inspire the
   participants in the intervention group. Participants' self-efficacy and
   self-management questionnaire scores, Kidney Disease Quality of Life
   scores, body composition, and laboratory examinations before and after
   the intervention were compared between the intervention and control
   groups.
   Results: A total of 49 participants completed the study (25 in the
   intervention group and 24 in the control group); 74\% of the
   participants were men and the mean age was 51.22 years. There were no
   differences in measured baseline characteristics between the groups
   except for educational background. After the intervention, the
   intervention group showed significantly higher scores for self-efficacy
   (mean 171.28, SD 22.92 vs mean 142.21, SD 26.36; P<.001) and
   self-management (mean 54.16, SD 6.71 vs mean 47.58, SD 6.42; P=.001).
   Kidney Disease Quality of Life scores were also higher in the
   intervention group (mean 293.16, SD 34.21 vs mean 276.37, SD 32.21;
   P=.02). The number of steps per day increased in the intervention group
   (9768.56 in week 1 and 11,389.12 in week 12). The estimated glomerular
   filtration rate (eGFR) of the intervention group was higher than that of
   the control group (mean 72.47, SD 24.28 vs mean 59.69, SD 22.25
   mL/min/1.73m(2); P=.03) and the decline in eGFR was significantly slower
   in the intervention group (-0.56 vs -4.58 mL/min/1.73m(2)). There were
   no differences in body composition between groups postintervention.
   Conclusions: The use of wearable devices, a health management platform,
   and social media support not only strengthened self-efficacy and
   self-management but also improved quality of life and a slower eGFR
   decline in people with CKD at stages 1-4. These results outline a new
   self-management model to promote healthy lifestyle behaviors for
   patients with CKD.}},

   actuation, these novel connecting joints can either operate as torsional
   hinges, which create isometric transformation (like origami folding)
   between connected tiles, or bistable translational springs, which
   accommodate metric-changing transformation between connected tiles. A
   specific example of a reconfigurable surface with square tile shape that
   can morph into flat, cylindrical (in two different directions), and
   spherical configurations with simple actuation is given. (C) 2020

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{CdS nanowire array on foil has been fabricated through a solvothermal
   method, which is uniform, regular and approximately perpendicular to the
   Cd foil. With the variation of sulfur precursor concentration, the
   relative intensity of (100), (002) and (101) peak are variable. The
   nanostructured CdS show the preferential (002)-orientation growth. At
   the sulfur concentration of 0.1 mol/l, 0.2 mol/l and 0.3 mol/l, CdS
   nanowires are approximately perpendicular to the Cd foil. At the high
   sulfur concentration, the characterization of array is destroyed. The
   band gap, which are estimated from the absorptance spectra using the
   Kubelka-Munk method, increase with the increasing sulfur precursor
   concentration until the concentration reaches up to 0.4 mol/l and no
   longer increases. It is very important to understand the relation
   between the experimental parameters and the physical properties of the
   CdS nanowires.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of xanthan gum (XG) addition and oil contents on the structural
   and rheological properties of Pickering emulsion stabilized by xanthan
   gum/Lysozyme nanoparticles (XG/Ly NPs) were analyzed by microstructure,
   creaming index, and rheological analysis. The results showed that XG
   addition reduced the droplet size of the emulsion, and a denser
   three-dimensional network structure was formed between droplets in the
   continuous phase. Thus, the migration of droplets slowed down, and the
   stability of Pickering emulsion increased. Rheological studies indicated
   that the network structure of Pickering emulsion depends on XG addition
   and oil content. The critical strain (gamma(co)) displayed three
   regimes. For low oil content (20\%), gamma(co) decreased with the
   increase of XG concentration. For Pickering emulsion with medium oil
   content (40\%, v/v), gamma(co) increased with increasing addition of XG.
   When high oil content (60-80\%) was provided, gamma(co) was almost
   independent of XG addition. The results showed that the microstructure,
   stability and rheological properties of Pickering emulsion stabilized by
   XG/Ly NPs could be regulated by XG addition and oil content. This
   attempt provided theoretical support for regulating Pickering emulsion
   properties by polysaccharides addition, and established Pickering
   emulsions with various demands. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Relatively high dielectric loss often limits the widespread utilization
   of photoetchable glasses (PEG) in three-dimensional system packaging.
   Herein, we present the influence of B-doping on network structures and
   dielectric properties of a Li-Al-Si-based PEG. The addition of B is
   found to markedly reduce the dielectric losses over the VHF-UHF bands
   making these PEGs more suitable for applications. Moreover, the effect
   of UV exposure on structural transformations is studied by X-ray
   diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. At a B2O3 additive content of 2
   wt.-\%, the average dielectric loss and dielectric constant are found to
   be 0.005 and 4.57, respectively, before UV exposure. However, these
   values decrease to 0.0015 and 3.65, respectively, after UV exposure and
   thermal annealing. The annealing temperature of PEG can be adjusted
   based on crystallization temperature since the stability of the boron
   trihedra are higher than that of the silicon-oxygen tetrahedra. Overall,
   it is determined that the use of B2O3 as an additive is effective in
   altering the dielectric properties of photosensitive glass making the
   PEGs more suitable for low loss three-dimensional system packaging for
   use over VHF and UHF bands.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the mechanism through which HRM practices promote
   firms' innovation and how this relationship differs across cultures.
   Based on a data-set of 3755 firms from 13 countries, this study finds
   that in most countries employee-oriented HRM practices that dedicate
   attention to employee needs and interests are positively related to
   firms' market-sensing capability, which is the capability to
   continuously learn about their markets. Market-sensing capability is in
   turn significantly related to firms' product and process innovation.
   Cross-country examination further reveals that in high power distance
   countries employee-oriented HRM practices have a stronger positive
   effect than in low power distance countries. This study highlights the
   importance of HRM in supporting the use organizations make of external
   knowledge, which is critical for organizational innovation. Bringing an
   external perspective, we complement existing literature that emphasizes
   the role of HRM in integrating internal knowledge. Our cross-cultural
   findings contribute to the understanding of cultural contingency in HRM
   theories.}},

Abstract = {{Face masks are recommended to reduce community transmission of
   SARS-CoV-2. One of the primary benefits of face masks and other
   coverings is as source control devices to reduce the expulsion of
   respiratory aerosols during coughing, breathing, and speaking. Face
   shields and neck gaiters have been proposed as an alternative to face
   masks, but information about face shields and neck gaiters as source
   control devices is limited. We used a cough aerosol simulator with a
   pliable skin headform to propel small aerosol particles (0 to 7 mu m)
   into different face coverings. An N95 respirator blocked 99\% (standard
   deviation (SD) 0.3\%) of the cough aerosol, a medical grade procedure
   mask blocked 59\% (SD 6.9\%), a 3-ply cotton cloth face mask blocked
   51\% (SD 7.7\%), and a polyester neck gaiter blocked 47\% (SD 7.5\%) as
   a single layer and 60\% (SD 7.2\%) when folded into a double layer. In
   contrast, the face shield blocked 2\% (SD 15.3\%) of the cough aerosol.
   Our results suggest that face masks and neck gaiters are preferable to
   face shields as source control devices for cough aerosols.}},

Title = {{How lime-sand islands in the South China Sea have responded to global
   warming over the last 30 years: Evidence from satellite remote sensing
   images}},
Journal = {{GEOMORPHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{371}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{As global warming threatens their existence, there are widespread
   concerns regarding the persistence of lime-sand islands and the future
   of mid-ocean atoll nations. To investigate how climate change has
   affected lime-sand islands, changes in vegetation and other
   characteristics of such islands in the South China Sea (SCS) were
   investigated from 1989 to 2019 using 67 satellite images. First,
   boundaries of the lime-sand islands and their vegetation were extracted
   using an active contour extraction procedure called the gradient vector
   flow snake model. Afterwards, the spatial extents were estimated by
   enclosing the extracted boundaries, and the digital shoreline analysis
   system was used to calculate beach widths. Finally, area growth rates
   and speeds were used to evaluate areal changes in the lime -sand islands
   and their respective vegetation. Based on the estimated area growth
   rates, area growth speeds, and beach widths, the lime-sand islands in
   SCS eroded over the past three decades whereas their vegetation
   expanded. Further analysis suggested that direct inundation caused by
   sea-level rise might not be clearly identified from the satellite
   images. However, other climate change-related factors were most likely
   responsible for the observed island erosions. These factors included
   higher wave energy, stronger typhoon intensity and destructiveness, and
   accelerated coral reef degradation. In addition, the observed expansion
   of vegetation on the lime-sand islands was likely due to the increase in
   precipitation in a warming world. The results show that 1) the lime-sand
   islands will continue to erode whereas vegetation will continue to
   expand; 2) As vegetation growth is significantly inhibited by salt water
   when it is adjacent to the ocean, vegetation areas on lime-sand islands
   may start to continuously decline. Overall, this study is the first to
   quantitatively examine changes in SCS lime-sand islands due to global
   warming. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare mechanical bowel
   preparation (MBP) with oral laxative against no bowel preparation on the
   perioperative outcomes for pelvic floor dysfunction (PFD). The need for
   bowel preparation before vaginal surgery was thus also investigated.
   Methods: PFD patients undergoing vaginal surgery in Peking University
   People's hospital from September 2017 to July 2018 were randomly
   assigned to MBP (n = 60) or control (n = 60) groups. The two groups were
   compared for the incidence of preoperative abdominal symptoms and
   overall patient satisfaction, intraoperative visualization of the
   surgical field assessed by the surgeon, and postoperative recovery
   outcomes. Results: There were no statistically significant differences
   between the two groups (p > 0.05) for surgical visualization, the
   surgeons overall satisfaction, or for the rate of postoperative
   complications. However, patients in the MBP group reported more
   gastrointestinal symptoms and had reduced satisfaction compared to the
   control group (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The use of MBP before vaginal
   surgery reduces preoperative patient satisfaction while conferringno
   benefit in terms of optimizing surgical visualization and reducing
   postoperative complications. For patients with PFDs, it is safe and
   feasible to do without MBP before vaginal surgery.}},

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{As optical reporting elements, fluorescent proteins are extensively used
   in whole-cell microbial biosensors. However, the use of these optical
   reporters is limited in opaque media such as soil. This study described
   a method utilizing gas as a reporting signal that could be used for the
   rapid on-site detection of mercury in soil. In this biosensor, the MerR
   protein could capture mercury ions and then bind the promoter of the efe
   gene to initiate the synthesis of the ethylene (C2H4)-forming enzyme
   that produced the gas. The research showed that the mercury ion
   concentrations could be converted into C2H4 gas signals, which were
   quantified using a handheld C2H4 sensor. By optimizing the biosensor to
   improve its anti-interference ability in the system, it could detect
   mercury ion concentrations in the soil ranging from 0.2 to 20 mg/kg
   within 45 min, effectively reflecting whether the mercury pollution in
   the soil exceeded the limit standard. This study provides a simple,
   inexpensive, and portable method for the on-site detection of soil
   pollutants.}},

Title = {{Effects of aromatics on ionic liquids for C-4 alkylation reaction:
   Insights from scale-up experiment and molecular dynamics simulation}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{402}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Alkylation of isobutane and butenes in ionic liquids (ILs) is an
   important industrially applied and environmentally friendly process for
   the production of high quality gasoline. In a scale-up reactor, we found
   that the ILs with a small amount of aromatics would exhibit excellent
   performances for the alkylation reaction. The behaviors of aromatics on
   the liquid-liquid interface and the alkylation performance of IL/benzene
   have been investigated by molecular dynamics simulations and
   experimental studies. Based on density profile, segment orientation, and
   self-diffusion coefficient, the main reason that benzene affects the IL
   alkylation performance was discussed. Although the amount of benzene was
   small, benzene would accumulate in the acid-hydrocarbon interfacial
   layer during the alkylation process. A little benzene was enough to
   buffer the strong acidity of chloroaluminate anions at the interface.
   The presence of benzene also provided a transport channel for reactants,
   increasing the concentration of isobutane at the interface. At the
   interface, the proper acidity and higher isobutane-to-olefin ratio
   significantly improved the IL alkylation performance. Effects of other
   aromatics on the C-4 alkylation have also been studied, which further
   confirmed our findings in the IL/benzene alkylation reaction. Hopefully,
   these studies can provide useful information to the design of the ionic
   liquid catalysts and the optimization of the C-4 alkylation process.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding typical preschoolers' perceptions of communication modes
   could help guide augmentative and alternative communication (AAC)
   intervention for preschoolers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This
   study explored the perceptions of 16 typically developing preschoolers
   toward an (a) AAC application (app) on a tablet, (b) picture exchange
   using a binder with printed Picture Communication Symbols(TM), and (c)
   prelinguistic communication used by a preschooler with ASD in a series
   of videos the preschoolers watched. Using a multi-method design, the
   study implemented both quantitative (rank ordering and preference
   selection) and qualitative (interview) methodologies. Quantitative
   results revealed the typical preschoolers had a clear overall preference
   for the AAC app, but variation in preference existed when selecting a
   communication mode to use in specific social scenarios. Qualitative data
   show the children more easily understood the child with ASD when he used
   the AAC app and associated tablets with fun, which may have accounted
   for positive perceptions of this AAC mode. The study is exploratory in
   nature and limited by its size and scope. However, it provides insights
   useful for clinicians' understanding not just how typical preschoolers
   perceive various modes of communication, but also why they may perceive
   some more favorably than others, in order to tailor intervention
   accordingly.}},

   study was teacher use of BSP, with student academic engagement behavior
   being evaluated as a secondary dependent variable. Results from the
   study indicated that both procedures resulted in increases in teacher
   use of BSP, with little differentiation between performance feedback

Volume = {{402}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Various morphologies and structure properties of CeVO4 photocatalysts
   were prepared via ethylene glycol (EG)-aided hydrothermal method and
   characterized by XRD, SEM, EDX, TEM, XPS, UV-Vis diffuse reflectance, PL
   emission and transient photocurrent responses, respectively. The
   influence of EG content on morphology and structure of as-prepared
   samples was examined as regard the photodegradation performance of
   naphthalene (Nap) in natural seawater. The results showed that Ce2
   (CeVO4) sample with 10 mL EG addition exhibited the highest
   photodegradation efficiency of Nap, because the fusiform morphology of
   Ce2 sample favored the transportation of visible light and the
   separation of photoexcited carriers. In addition, the possible
   intermediate products were detected by FTIR, 3D fluorescence and GC-MS
   and the results showed only one mechanism of Nap direct conversion to
   CO2 and H2O was include in the photocatalytic reaction by Ce2 sample.
   The active species were detected by ESR and trapping experiments and the
   results showed that center dot OH played a more significant role in the
   photochemical degradation. Finally, the possible photodegradation
   mechanism of Nap over Ce2 sample was proposed on the basis of
   intermediate products and the active species formed in photodegradation
   process, and Ce-4(+)/Ce-3(+) redox centers of Ce2 sample was performed
   under the irradiation of visible light.}},

Abstract = {{We report a visible-light-driven, photocatalytic partial water splitting
   process that proceeds via an oxygenmediated, sequential single-electron
   transfer mechanism over heterogeneous photocatalysts. In the absence of
   any cocatalyst, hydrogen evolution efficiency of 78.9 and 643.0 mu mol
   h(-1) g(cata)(lyst)(-1) were achieved over a simple carbon nitride
   catalyst from methanol and formaldehyde solutions, respectively, in 1.0
   bar O-2 atmosphere at room temperature. On the carbon nitride catalyst,
   molecular O-2 is photocatalytically transformed into reactive oxygen
   species, which acted both as an oxidant and as a homogeneous catalyst
   for the partial photocatalytic water splitting reaction, resulting in
   the two-step oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde and subsequently
   formic acid. DFT calculations reveal that the new oxygen mediated
   photocatalytic hydrogen evolution pathway proceeds with virtually zero
   activation energy. Further improvement in hydrogen evolution efficiency
   was attained by doping the carbon nitride catalyst with phosphorous and
   sulfur, which promoted the transport of photogenerated charge carriers.}},

Abstract = {{A ratiometric electrochemiluminescence resonance energy transfer
   (ECL-RET) platform depended on novel dye BODIPY derivatives was proposed
   for rapid detection of lactoferrin. This ECL-RET platform is composed of
   aptamer decorated BODIPY composites and C-60@BSA, in which BODIPY
   derivative is the ECL probe and can generate significant resonance
   energy transfer with K2S2O8. BODIPY derivative and K2S2O8 are used as
   built-in reference signal and calibration signal respectively to
   eliminate background signal and abnormal change signal by double signal
   self-calibration process. At the same time, C-60, as the accelerator of
   K2S2O8, can effectively increase the ECL signal and further transfer as
   much energy as possible to BODIPY derivative. Under optimal conditions,
   the constructed ECL-RET platform exhibited sensitive detection of
   lactoferrin in the wide linear range of 10-4850 ng/mL with a LOD of 42
   fg/mL. Meanwhile, the proposed ECL-RET aptasensor demonstrated superior
   stability, specificity and reproducibility, displaying favorable
   application value in practical diagnosis of this method.}},

Title = {{Comparative study of oral and intranasal puerarin for prevention of
   brain injury induced by acute high-altitude hypoxia}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{591}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Human activities in the areas of high altitude have increased
   significantly recently. Brain is highly sensitive to changing of oxygen
   pressure due to high altitude, and this physiological response may lead
   to serious brain injury, such as learning and memory disabilities.
   Puerarin is a phytoestrogen with many pharmacological activities, such
   as treatment of neurological disorders. However, most of current drugs
   can not easily enter brain through the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The
   nose-to-brain route can bypass BBB for brain-targeting. Here,
   thermosensitive in situ hydrogels (TISGs) of puerarin were prepared with
   poloxamers 407, poloxamers 188 and propylene glycol to improve
   bioavailability and brain targeting. In vitro drug release in simulated
   nasal fluids, rheological properties and cilia toxicity of puerarin
   TISGs were explored. The pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of
   puerarin by intranasal (i.n.) and oral (p.o.) administrations were also
   evaluated. The viscosity of puerarin TISGs tended to increase obviously
   with increased temperature. The puerarin release profile and
   transmucosal process of puerarin TISGs could be described with the
   first-order kinetics equation, depending on drug diffusion. The cilia
   toxicity of puerarin TISGs was not obvious. Rat models of
   hypobarism/hypoxia-induced brain injury were established with a
   hypobaric simulation chamber. Morris water maze and open filed tests
   indicated that puerarin TISGs improved the spatial memory and
   spontaneous exploratory behavior of the rats suffering from
   hypoxia-induced brain injury. Furthermore, puerarin TISGs decreased the
   level of oxidative stress cytokines (malondialdehyde (MDA) and
   glutathione (GSH)) in the peripheral circulation, alleviated the
   cerebral histological lesions, and relieved the expression of
   hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha). Intranasal puerarin
   TISGs were absorbed quickly with a shorter T-max (10.0 +/- 5.7 min)
   compared to that of oral puerarin (36 +/- 13.4 min). In addition, the
   relative bioavailability of i.n. puerarin TISGs was high to 300\%
   compared to oral administration of puerarin. The area under the curve
   (AUC) of brain after i.n. administration of puerarin TISGs was 954.5 +/-
   335.1 h.ng/mL, while no puerarin was detected in the brain after oral
   administration. Therefore, i.n. puerarin TISGs led to excellent brain
   targeting effect. Puerarin TISGs are an effective neuroprotector
   formulation for prevention of brain injury induced by acute
   high-altitude hypoxia.}},

Abstract = {{As the structural unit of natural products, chromene derivatives show a
   wide range of biological activity and pharmacological activity due to
   their unique photophysical and chemical properties. Ten years ago, our
   research group discovered the ``thiol-chromene{''} click reaction, which
   achieved the selective detection of thiols through the change of the
   optical spectrum. Afterward, we attempted to develop various
   chromene-based fluorescent probes for imaging including near-infrared
   (NIR) probe, ratiometric probe, and multifunctional probe. However, how
   to integrate the fluorophore and reaction sites into the chromene-based
   skeleton remains challenging. In this work, we connected the chromene
   motif with the NIR fluorophore methylene blue utilizing a carbamate
   spacer to provide a new fluorescent probe (CM-NIR), which is triggered
   by thiols to open the pyran ring followed by attacking the carbamate by
   phenolate to releases the methylene blue. This novel cascade mechanism
   avoids the formation of paraquinone methides, which proved to be toxic
   to normal cells. CM-NIR also showed the specific imaging of thiols in
   living cells and mice. More importantly, the thiols level in
   drug-resistant cancer cells was found to be significantly higher than
   that in the corresponding cancer cell, which indicated that the thiols
   level may have an important role in cancer cells developing drug
   resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Catalpa bungei is an important ornamental plant and timber species that
   originated in China. With the forth-coming C. bungei genome sequence, an
   efficient and convenient transformation system should be developed. The
   transient gene expression system using protoplasts is fast and efficient
   and can be applied to study the functions of genes in C. bungei. In this
   study, the main factors influencing the isolation of protoplasts from C.
   bungei were optimized by orthogonal design. The results showed that when
   the enzymolysis solution contained 3\% Cellulase RS (w/v), 2\% Macemzyme
   R-10 (w/v), and 0.4 M mannitol and the enzymolysis time was 8 h, the
   protoplast yield was 1 x 10(6) protoplasts/g fresh weight {[}FM]. The
   viability of protoplasts was approximately 90 \% under optimal
   enzymolysis conditions. Furthermore, using GFP as the reporter gene, we
   verified the feasibility of PEG-mediated protoplast transformation of C.
   bungei. We established an efficient protoplast isolation procedure and
   feasible transient gene expression system. This methodology, when
   combined with genetics and omics techniques, will allow further study of
   the functions of the genes in C. bungei.}},

Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Radiotherapy represents a critical component in cancer treatment.
   However, premature ovarian failure (POF) is a major hurdle of
   deleterious off-target effects in young females, which, therefore, call
   for an effective radioprotective agent. The present study aimed to
   explore the molecular mechanism underlying the protective effects of
   N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) against gamma-radiation-provoked POF. Immature
   female Sprague-Dawley rats were orallyadministered NAC (50 mg/kg) and
   were exposed to a single whole-body dose of 3.2 Gy Upsilon-radiation.
   NAC administration remarkably reversed abnormal serum estradiol and
   anti-Miillerian hormone levels by 73\% and 40\%, respectively while
   ameliorating the histopathological and ultrastructural
   alterations-triggered by gamma-radiation. Mechanistically, NAC
   alleviated radiation-induced oxidative damage through significantly
   increased glutathione pemxidase activity by 102\% alongside with
   decreasing NADPH oxidase subunits (p22 and NOX4) gene expressions by
   48\% and 38\%, respectively compared to the irradiated untreated group.
   Moreover, NAC administration achieved its therapeutic effect by
   inhibiting ovarian apoptosis-induced by radiation through downregulating
   p53 and Bax levels by 33\% and 16\%, respectively while increasing the
   Bcl-2 mRNA expression by 135\%. Hence, the Bax/Bc12 ratio and cytochrome
   c expression were subsequently reduced leading to decreased caspase 3
   activity by 43\%. Importantly, the anti-apoptotic property of NAC could
   be attributed to inactivation of MAPK signaling molecules; p38 and JNK,
   and enhancement of the ovarian vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
   expression. Taken together, our results suggest that NAC can inhibit
   radiotherapy-induced POF while preserving ovarian function and structure
   through upregulating VEGF expression and suppressing NOX4/MAPK/p53
   apoptotic signaling.}},

Abstract = {{Cu/Ga + In (CGI) ratio in Cu(In,Ga)Se-2 (CIGSe) semiconductor plays a
   decisive role in solar energy conversion. Investigations published so
   far relevant to CIGSe at different CGI values are solely based on the
   expensive vacuum process and as a result, there is a strong urge to
   explore a low-cost process. In this regard, we herein report the
   preparation of CIGSe at diverse CGI value from 0.70 to 0.97 by a facile
   and cost-effective solution process for the first time. From structural
   analysis, the blue shift is perceived by decreasing CGI value, which is
   related to shrinkage in the unit cell volume because of the reduction in
   the Cu content. As CGI value increases, crystal diameter of CIGSe vastly
   changed from nano to micro (50-1300 nm), whereas crystal shape reformed
   from irregular to hexagonal flake-like shape, which could be due to
   excessive influence of Cu content that alters nucleation and growth of
   crystals. Diverse CGI value modified Se/(Cu + In + Ga) ratio while
   Ga/(Ga + In) ratio remains unchanged. Bandgap energy is increased from
   1.22 to 1.41 eV as Cu-deficiency increases. The morphological analysis
   showed a uniform, smooth and crack-free CIGSe films with a thickness of
   similar to 1 mu m. The electrical properties of CIGSe are greatly
   changed. For instance, at higher CGI value (0.97), the carrier
   concentration is increased by five-order magnitude, whereas mobility
   improved by 109 times and resistivity decreased by 87 times as compared
   to lower CGI value (0.70). Moreover, photocurrent is markedly enhanced
   by six-order magnitude explicitly from nA to mA. As a proof of concept,
   solar cells are fabricated and power conversion efficiency significantly
   enhanced from 0.16\% to 3.38\% by altering CGI value. Hence, this work
   eminently evidences the importance of tuning CGI value by low-cost
   solution process and provides new perceptions into properties of CIGSe
   solar cell absorber as a function of CGI value.}},

Abstract = {{The association of atopic dermatitis (AD) with a wide variety of ocular
   complications is known; however, there is no study in the literature
   that measured lens densitometry in pediatric patients with AD. This
   study aimed to investigate lens densitometry in children with AD. In
   order to examine ocular complications in AD, 31 pediatric patients (13
   males, 18 females; mean age 12 +/- 3 years) with AD and 20 healthy
   children (9 males, 11 females; mean age 12 +/- 2 years), who presented
   to the dermatology clinic of Istanbul Medipol Mega University between
   December 2018 and May 2019 were included in this study. The diagnosis of
   AD was based on the UK Working Party's Diagnostic Criteria for AD.
   Patients receiving inhaler and systemic steroids were excluded from the
   study. All children were examined by the same dermatologist and
   ophthalmologist. The mean values of best-corrected visual acuity,
   refractive error, and axial length were similar between both groups (P >
   .05). The lens densitometry values of zone 1, zone 2, and zone 3, as
   well as the average lens densitometry measurements were found
   statistically significantly higher in children with AD compared to the
   controls (P < .05 for all). This is the first study to demonstrate an
   increase in treatment-independent lens densitometry in children with AD.}},

   after neutron irradiation near recrystallization temperatures}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{542}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The tensile properties of powder-metallurgical-processed Pure W, K-doped
   W, W-3\%Re, and K-doped W-3\%Re were examined after neutron irradiation
   up to 0.7 dpa at 910-1020 degrees C with a thermal neutron shield in the
   High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR). After irradiation, recrystallized Pure
   W (R) exhibited a brittle fracture mode, while recrystallized K-doped
   W-3\%Re (R) exhibited a ductile fracture mode at 500 degrees C. K-doped
   W-3\%Re (R) has fine grains, and hence, contains a considerable number
   of grain boundaries that act as sinks for irradiation defects. Solid
   solute Re in the W matrix could improve not only the mechanical
   properties of W, but also its resistance to neutron irradiation. At 500
   degrees C, the ductility of K-doped W-3\%Re after irradiation was
   significantly higher than that of Pure W. The irradiation at similar to
   1000 degrees C did not induce hardening of stress-relieved (SR) W
   materials, but SR W materials tended to exhibit a decrease in the
   ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and an increase in total elongation
   (TE). The softening due to the recovery and recrystallization of SR W
   materials and the hardening due to the formation of irradiation defect
   clusters were balanced during irradiation at similar to 1000 degrees C,
   and ductility was exhibited without an increase in strength. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{Thermal fatigue cracks have been found at T-junctions where high and low
   temperature fluids flow in. In this study, the heat transfer coefficient
   at a T-junction was investigated. The obtained heat transfer coefficient
   was then validated by estimating the temperatures on a pipe inner
   surface. The temperatures of the fluid and the pipe inner surface were
   measured by mock-up tests in which high and low temperature water was
   mixed. The fluid temperature fluctuation near the boundary between the
   hot jet flow and the cold main flow caused the temperature on the pipe
   inner surface to fluctuate. The heat transfer coefficient was obtained
   by the power spectrum method for the pipe inner surface where the
   temperature fluctuation was relatively large. The estimated heat
   transfer coefficient was 3.3 times larger than that calculated by the
   Dittus-Boelter equation. The temperature on the pipe inner surface was
   successfully estimated using the obtained heat transfer coefficient and
   the measured fluid temperature in the vicinity of the inner surface. The
   prediction error was less than +/- 20\% for the temperature fluctuation

Abstract = {{Understanding the role of the oxygen content in silicon suboxides (SiOx)
   is important for the improvement of their performance as promising
   negative electrode materials for Li-ion batteries. Furthermore,
   sufficient research has not been conducted on tailoring the oxidation of
   silicon suboxides to employ them as anodes. To address these
   limitations, we demonstrated the lithiation of SiO2 and amorphous SiOx
   up to four Li atoms per SiOx and performed density functional theory
   calculations to examine the energetics, structural evolution, charge
   effects, mechanical properties, and volume energy density of lithiated
   a-SiOx. Our calculations show that two Li defects effectively break a
   Si-O bond in SiO2 and a single Li defect is easily stabilized by oxygen
   in a-SiOx. With lithiation, oxygen-tailored SiOx exhibits a difference
   in volume change and in voltage profiles. The tradeoff between the
   decreasing volume change ratio and increasing potential as the O content
   increases results in varied volume energy densities. The detailed
   reduction mechanism of Li in the a-SiOx system was analyzed by
   calculating the Bader charge. Our results emphasize the importance of
   tailoring the O content to obtain desired lithiation properties and give
   the physical insight of the development and rational design strategy of
   high-performance SiOx anodes dependent on the oxidation conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Bonding the upper and lower faces of a nanocomposite porous plate with
   piezoceramics eventuates a smart multidisciplinary plate (SMP). In the
   current work, the deflection and stress responses of such SMP5 under
   static electrical voltages and mechanical loads have been presented. The
   middle plate of SMP is assumed to have simultaneous functionally graded
   (FG) dispersions of pore and nanofiller along the thickness. The
   enhancement parts of the nanocomposite material are assumed to be carbon
   nanotubes (CNTs) and their agglomerations with random orientations. The
   mechanical properties of such three-part nanocomposites are evaluated
   using EshelbyMori-Tanaka (EMT)'s technique. The coupled
   electromechanical governing equation of SMP under static loads is
   obtained by the estimation of displacement field with Reddy's third
   order theory (Reddy's TSDT) of plates. The coupled equation is also
   treated by developing a mesh-free solution to examine the impacts of
   embedding nanofillers and pores on the static electromechanical
   deflection and stress responses of SMP5. The results reveal that
   embedding pores up to around 90\% of the volume of the middle plate
   leads to only 11.3\% and 2.2\% increase in mechanical and electrical
   deflections, respectively. Moreover, due to the formation of CNTs
   agglomerations, enhancing the middle plate with CNTs has a sharp
   positive impact on the reduction of deflections only up to some limited
   values of CNT volume fractions.}},

Title = {{Improving classification accuracy using data augmentation on small data

Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{161}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Data augmentation (DA) is a key element in the success of Deep Learning
   (DL) models, as its use can lead to better prediction accuracy values
   when large size data sets are used. DA was not very much used with
   earlier neural network models before 2012, and the reason might be
   related to the type of models and the size of the data sets used. We
   investigate in this work, applying several state-of-the-art models based
   on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks
   (GANs), the effect of DA when using small size data sets, analyzing the
   results in terms of the prediction accuracy obtained according to the
   different characteristics of the training samples (number of instances
   and features, and class unbalance degree). We further introduce
   modifications to the standard methods used to generate the synthetic
   samples to alter the class balance representation, and the overall
   results indicate that with some computational effort a significant
   increase in prediction accuracy can be obtained when small data sets are
   considered. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{An augmented cohesive element for coarse meshes in delamination analysis
   of composites}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{254}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Numerical analysis of delamination failure in composite laminates is
   very often carried out with cohesive interface element in a finite
   element framework, due to their robustness and ease of use. Explicit
   time integration is often preferred, to overcome material and damage
   non-linearly and impact loading scenarios. However, a very fine mesh is
   needed to correctly represent the nonlinear cohesive zone ahead of the
   numerical crack tip to achieve a stable and mesh size insensitive global
   failure response. This is especially true for mode I delamination cases,
   where the cohesive zone is extremely small, owing to a low critical
   energy release rate. This mesh size requirement limits the applicability
   of cohesive zone models largely to coupon scale problems. The current
   work augments cohesive elements with additional rotational degrees of
   freedom at the nodes, which enables a higher order displacement
   approximation and allows relatively coarser mesh to be used. The present
   formulation is applied to a mode I delamination benchmark problem, which
   demonstrates the superiority of the augmented element over the
   traditional cohesive element in terms of coarse-mesh accuracy and
   computational time saving.}},

Abstract = {{Developmental mode along the altricial-precocial spectrum is well known
   to be influenced by brain development and maturation. The greater cane
   rat (GCR) is an indigenous precocial African rodent with uncommon
   phenotypes and life traits. This study was therefore designed to
   characterize and describe distinctive external developmental features in
   the prenatal GCR brain across the entire gestational length using the
   emergence and differentiation of external features of the brain
   vesicles. Four gross morphometric brain parameters (weight, length,
   width, and height) were evaluated and expressed as mean +/- SEM.
   Relationship between all brain morphometrics and gestation length were
   analyzed using one-way ANOVA and linear regression. Developmental
   milestones in the prenatal GCR were then compared with closely related
   precocial mammals. The earliest time point with gross observable
   features in the prenatal GCR brain was at gestation day (GD) 60. The
   period with the most remarkable gross developmental features was noted
   between GD80 and GD100. Some of these gross features include
   differentiation of the cerebellar plate into vermis and lateral lobes,
   emergence of the piriform lobes, mammillary bodies, colliculi bodies,
   cerebral peduncles, and primordial pons. By GD130, most gross
   topographic neural features were already established. Cerebellar
   lobation and patterning at GD130 were the last recognizable gross
   developmental features noticed in the prenatal GCR brain. This coincided
   with the time of first eye opening in the GCR fetus. The developmental
   pattern observed in the prenatal GCR brain is similar to those noted in
   precocial rodent like the guinea pig. However, the onset of these
   milestones was delayed, and their duration was relatively shorter in the
   GCR. This study provides a frame of baseline reference of morphological
   brain features in the GCR embryos and fetuses that will be useful for
   fetal age estimation, for home grown neurodevelopmental and
   eco-toxicological studies, as this rodent is being proposed as a
   research model. (c) 2020 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

Title = {{Associations between legal performance-enhancing substance use and
   future cardiovascular disease risk factors in young adults: A
   prospective cohort study}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Background Legal performance-enhancing substances (PES), such as
   creatine, are commonly used by adolescents and young adults. As PES are
   mostly unregulated by the US Food and Drug Administration, there has
   been limited empirical attention devoted to examining their long-term
   safety and health outcomes. Preliminary studies have demonstrated
   associations between PES use and severe medical events, including
   hospitalizations and death. PES could be linked to cardiovascular
   disease (CVD), the most common cause of mortality in the US, by altering
   the myocardium, vasculature, or metabolism. The objective of this study
   was to examine prospective associations between the use of legal PES in
   young adulthood and CVD risk factors at seven-year follow-up.
   Materials and methods Nationally representative longitudinal cohort data
   from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health,
   Waves III (2001-2002) and IV (2008), were analyzed. Regression models
   determined the prospective association between the use of legal PES
   (e.g. creatine monohydrate) and CVD risk factors (e.g. body mass index,
   diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia), adjusting for relevant
   covariates.
   Results Among the diverse sample of 11,996 male and female participants,
   no significant differences by PES use in body mass index, diabetes,
   hypertension, or hyperlipidemia were noted at Wave III. In unadjusted
   comparisons, legal PES users (versus non-users) were more likely to be
   White, be male, be college educated, drink alcohol, and engage in
   weightlifting, exercise, individual sports, team sports, and other
   strength training. There were no significant prospective associations
   between legal PES use at Wave III and body mass index, hemoglobin A1c,
   systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and cholesterol (total, HDL, LDL,
   triglycerides) deciles at seven-year follow-up (Wave IV), adjusting for
   demographics, health behaviors, and Wave III CVD risk factors.
   Similarly, there were no significant prospective associations between
   legal PES use and diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia based on
   objective measures or self-reported medications and diagnoses, adjusting
   for demographics, health behaviors, and Wave III CVD risk.
   Conclusions We do not find evidence for a prospective association
   between legal PES use and CVD risk factors in young adults over seven
   years of follow-up, including BMI, diabetes, hypertension, or
   hyperlipidemia. It should be noted that legal PES use was
   operationalized dichotomously and as one broad category, which did not
   account for frequency, amount, or duration of use. Given the lack of
   regulation and clinical trials data, observational studies can provide
   much needed data to inform the safety and long-term health associations
   of legal PES use and, in turn, inform clinical guidance and policy.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Advanced liver disease due to hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a
   leading cause of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related morbidity
   and mortality. There remains a need to develop noninvasive predictors of
   clinical outcomes in persons with HIV/HCV coinfection.
   Methods. We conducted a nested case-control study in 126 patients with
   HIV/HCV and utilized multiple quantitative metabolomic assays to
   identify a prognostic profile that predicts end-stage liver disease
   (ESLD) events including ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatocellular
   carcinoma, esophageal variceal bleed, and spontaneous bacterial
   peritonitis. Each analyte class was included in predictive modeling, and
   area under the receiver operator characteristic curves (AUC) and
   accuracy were determined.
   Results. The baseline model including demographic and clinical data had
   an AUC of 0.79. Three models (baseline plus amino acids, lipid
   metabolites, or all combined metabolites) had very good accuracy (AUC,
   0.84-0.89) in differentiating patients at risk of developing an ESLD
   complication up to 2 years in advance. The all combined metabolites
   model had sensitivity 0.70, specificity 0.85, positive likelihood ratio
   4.78, and negative likelihood ratio 0.35.
   Conclusions. We report that quantification of a novel set of metabolites
   may allow earlier identification of patients with HIV/ HCV who have the
   greatest risk of developing ESLD clinical events.}},

Title = {{A collaborative machine learning-optimization algorithm to improve the
   finite element model updating of civil engineering structures}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{225}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Finite element model updating has become a key tool to improve the
   numerical modelling of existing civil engineering structures, by
   adjusting the numerical response to the observed experimental behaviour
   of the structure. At present, model updating is mostly conducted using
   the maximum likelihood method. Following this approach, the updating
   problem can be transformed into a multi-objective optimization problem.
   Due to the complex nonlinear behaviour of the resulting objective
   functions, metaheuristic optimization algorithms are normally employed
   to solve such optimization problem. However, and although this is
   nowadays a wellestablished technique, there are still two main drawbacks
   that need to be addressed for practical engineering applications,
   namely: (i) the high simulation time required to compute the problem;
   and (ii) the uncertainty associated with the selection of the best
   updated model among all the Pareto optimal solutions. In order to
   overcome these limitations, a new collaborative algorithm is proposed
   herein, which takes advantage of the collaborative coupling among two
   optimization algorithms (harmony search and active-set algorithms), a
   machine learning technique (artificial neural networks) and a
   statistical tool (principal component analysis). The implementation
   details of our proposal are discussed in detail throughout the paper and
   its performance is illustrated with a case study addressing the model
   updating of a real steel footbridge. Two are the main advantages of the
   newly proposed algorithm: (i) it leads to a clear reduction of the
   simulation time; and (ii) it further permits a robust selection of the
   best updated model.}},

   thermochromic leuco dyes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{1222}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{It has long been known that heat, UV light, or protonization will cause
   the bond in Leuco dye's to break. The underlying microscopic mechanism
   is a still a matter of discussion. It stands to reason that a local
   model should correctly predict the temperature behavior of the heat
   capacity at the thermochromic phase transition. Here we develop a tight
   binding (TB) model for the variation of the energy of the bond as it
   breaks as a function of temperature. We use a statistical mechanical
   approach to incorporate this variation in a partition function,
   calculate a free energy, and obtain the heat capacity of the phase
   transition. A distribution of such heat capacities is shown to fit the
   data for the leuco dye. The heat capacity distribution is compared to
   the experimentally determined heat capacity by differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC). (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A coupled Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics-Volume Compensated Particle
   Method (SPH-VCPM) for Fluid Structure Interaction (FSI) modelling}},
Journal = {{OCEAN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{218}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{A new unified particle model that couples the Smoothed Particle
   Hydrodynamics (SPH) and a discontinuous approach known as the Volume
   Compensated Particle Method (VCPM) is developed to solve Fluid Structure
   Interaction (FSI) problems involving large deformation. Unlike the model
   that couples the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics and the Discrete
   Element Method (i.e. SPH-DEM) in which the applicable Poisson's ratio of
   the solid material should be less than certain critical values, the
   current unified particle model is able to model solid materials of large
   Poisson's ratio by using only axial interaction between solid particles.
   The coupling between SPH and VCPM is accomplished by treating the solid
   particles of VCPM at the solid-fluid interface as dummy particles in
   SPH. This paper presents the first SPH-VCPM coupled method for FSI with
   comprehensive validations. The VCPM solver is firstly verified for
   solving static and dynamic solid mechanics problems. Then, the proposed
   solver is used to solve several FSI problems involving free surface,
   i.e. water column on an Aluminum plate, flow under an elastic gate, dam
   break problems involving flexible structures and deformation of flexible
   structure in a rolling oil tank. The SPH-VCPM results match well with
   the published numerical results obtained from the literature.}},

   the Gut Microbiota}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR BIOSCIENCES}},

Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The gut microbiota is composed of a large number of different bacteria,
   that play a key role in the construction of a metabolic signaling
   network. Deepening the link between metabolic pathways of the gut
   microbiota and human health, it seems increasingly essential to
   evolutionarily define the principal technologies applied in the field
   and their future trends. We use a topic analysis tool, Latent Dirichlet
   Allocation, to extract themes as a probabilistic distribution of latent
   topics from literature dataset. We also use the Prophet neural network
   prediction tool to predict future trend of this area of study. A total
   of 1,271 abstracts (from 2006 to 2020) were retrieved from MEDLINE with
   the query on ``gut microbiota{''} and ``metabolic pathway.{''} Our study
   found 10 topics covering current research types: dietary health,
   inflammation and liver cancer, fatty and diabetes, microbiota community,
   hepatic metabolism, metabolomics-based approach and SFCAs, allergic and
   immune disorders, gut dysbiosis, obesity, brain reaction, and
   cardiovascular disease. The analysis indicates that, with the rapid
   development of gut microbiota research, the metabolomics-based approach
   and SCFAs (topic 6) and dietary health (topic 1) have more studies being
   reported in the last 15 years. We also conclude from the data that,
   three other topics could be heavily focused in the future:
   metabolomics-based approach and SCFAs (topic 6), obesity (topic 8) and
   brain reaction and cardiovascular disease (topic 10), to unravel
   microbial affecting human health.}},

Title = {{Temperature-dependent magnetic properties of magnetite nanoparticles
   synthesized via coprecipitation method}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{846}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, temperature-dependent magnetic properties of magnetite
   nanoparticles (MNPs) synthesized at room temperature via chemical
   coprecipitation were investigated. Monodispersed MNPs with an average
   size of 11.22 nm were synthesized at a stirring rate of 200 rpm and a pH
   value of 10. The phase composition, particle size/morphology, and
   magnetic properties of the synthesized nanoparticles were characterized
   by X-ray diffractometer (XRD), scanning transmission electron microscope
   (STEM) and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID),
   respectively. The results show that the synthesized nanoparticles are
   magnetite with a spinel structure without any impurities. The
   synthesized MNPs exhibit a nearly spherical morphology with a uniform
   particle size distribution and an average particle size of 11 nm. Based
   on the analysis of the temperature-dependent magnetic properties at
   5-300 K, the coercivity and remanence in the hysteresis loop for the
   MNPs decrease with the increase in temperature and disappear at room
   temperature (i.e., 300 K), thus showing a superparamagnetic behaviour.
   The superparamagnetic behaviour of the synthesized MNPs was analysed
   using a developed model based on the core-shell theory. The experimental
   results of magnetization are in a reasonable agreement with the
   calculated data by the developed model. The magnetic susceptibility of
   the synthesized MNPs increases and the coercivity, exchange bias,
   remanent and saturation magnetizations decrease with the increase of the
   temperature. It is indicated that the synthesized MNPs could be used as
   a promising candidate in various applications such as heat transfer,
   magnetic hyperthermia and magnetic separation. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{A Lattice-Boltzmann-based perturbation method}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{213}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we report on the development and initial validation of a
   new hybrid numerical model for the simulation of incompressible flow. A
   kinetic Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) model using a reduced domain is
   nested within an inviscid flow field to provide increased simulation
   fidelity where desired, while leveraging the computational efficiency of
   inviscid solutions. We formulate a fully (or strongly) coupled approach,
   in which a Helmholtz decomposition is applied to the flow, separating
   the inviscid and viscous perturbation parts. The latter component is
   driven by the inviscid field through nonlinear inviscid-perturbation
   interaction terms that, in conventional Navier-Stokes solvers, would be
   expressed as volume forces. In the present work an equivalent LBM
   approach is presented where, as opposed to a body-force coupling, a
   strong coupling within the LBM collision operators is presented. The
   resulting hybrid LBM is applied to validation cases for a wave driven
   boundary layer and the flow past a cylinder. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Interactions between hydrated Ce3+ and various carboxylates are of
   fundamental interest. Anomalously strong interactions with Ce3+ occur
   when diglycolic acid (DGA) is added into a Ce3+ aqueous solution, unlike
   various other carboxylic acids. Herein, the complex-formation constants
   of Ce3+ with these acids are evaluated via absorption and emission
   spectra. Hydrated Ce3+ emits fluorescence with unity quantum yield;
   however, addition of various carboxylates statically quenches the
   fluorescence when Ce3+-carboxylate complexes form because the
   fluorescence lifetime is constant irrespective of the carboxylate
   concentration. In the observed static quenching, the complex-formation
   constants obtained from the absorption and emission spectra (K-abs and
   K-em) agree well. The binding of Ce3+ by the conjugate Lewis bases,
   i.e., carboxylates, is approximately inversely proportional to the pH.
   Adding DGA into the system also statically quenches the fluorescence,
   but far more efficiently, even in a much weaker solution. We rigorously
   deduce K-abs and K-em of Ce3+ with DGA without any approximation using
   comparable concentrations. Careful fittings provide equivalent K-em and
   K-abs values, and by varying the pH and ionic strength, we confirm that
   this equivalence is an inherent property of the Ce3+-DGA system. The
   Lewis acid-base theory cannot explain why DGA binds to Ce3+ similar to
   1000 times more strongly than the other carboxylates. This anomalously
   strong binding may be due to a chelate effect caused by the DGA's
   central oxygen atom, which forms a five-membered ring with the conjugate
   Lewis bases of DGA; double chelate rings can also form, while
   bis-deprotonated DGA binds to Ce3+, facilitated by the central oxygen.
   Therefore, DGA enables efficient quenching through the chelate effect
   when it binds to Ce3+.}},

Abstract = {{Background The guidelines for the prevention, detection, and management
   of gastroenterological surgical site infections (SSIs) were published in
   Japanese by the Japan Society for Surgical Infection in 2018. This is a
   summary of these guidelines for medical professionals worldwide. Methods
   We conducted a systematic review and comprehensive evaluation of the
   evidence for diagnosis and treatment of gastroenterological SSIs, based
   on the concepts of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment,
   Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. The strength of
   recommendations was graded and voted using the Delphi method and the
   nominal group technique. Modifications were made to the guidelines in
   response to feedback from the general public and relevant medical
   societies. Results There were 44 questions prepared in seven subject
   areas, for which 51 recommendations were made. The seven subject areas
   were: definition and etiology, diagnosis, preoperative management,
   prophylactic antibiotics, intraoperative management, perioperative
   management, and wound management. According to the GRADE system, we
   evaluated the body of evidence for each clinical question. Based on the
   results of the meta-analysis, recommendations were graded using the
   Delphi method to generate useful information. The final version of the
   recommendations was published in 2018, in Japanese. Conclusions The
   Japanese Guidelines for the prevention, detection, and management of
   gastroenterological SSI were published in 2018 to provide useful
   information for clinicians and improve the clinical outcome of patients.}},

Abstract = {{Facing the multiple pressures of energy reserves decline, ecological
   environment deterioration and transportation industry prosperity, in
   order to enhance the marine performance, improve the enterprises
   economic benefits, and achieve the purpose of energy conservation and
   emission reduction, the revolution of green and efficient waste heat
   recovery technology is imperative. Therefore, the exergy-based
   configuration design of marine cascade waste heat recovery system is
   proposed, including supercritical Brayton cycle, organic Rankine cycle,
   organic flash cycle, organic trilateral cycle and absorption
   refrigeration cycle. Firstly, the mathematical models of three
   cycle-configurations are established based on thermodynamic equations,
   and the authority of simulation results is preliminarily verified. Then,
   the relationship between working-fluid, matching mode and operation
   parameters with cycle-configuration performance is analyzed in turn.
   After the multi-objective optimization, the thermodynamic performance
   and economic benefits of the cycle-configuration are comprehensively
   evaluated. Finally, the positive influence of the accumulator on the
   refrigeration system is explored. The numerical results prove that the
   proposed cycle-configuration has significant thermodynamic performance
   and economic benefits, reflects the good performance of energy saving
   and emission reduction, and can eliminate the negative impact of latent
   heat fluctuation on the refrigeration system. It provides a feasible
   idea for researchers and manufacturers who are committed to
   comprehensively improve the performance of cascade waste heat recovery,
   and fills the research gap in the latest investigation.}},

Abstract = {{In this research, a protein nanofiber membrane (P-COOH-CEW) was
   developed to treat the dye waste. Initially, polyacrylonitrile nanofiber
   membrane (PAN) was prepared by electrospinning, followed by heat
   treatment, alkaline treatment, and neutralization to obtain weak cation
   exchange nanofiber membrane (P-COOH). The P-COOH membrane was chemically
   coated with chicken egg white (CEW) proteins to obtain a 3D structure of
   complex protein nanofiber membrane (P-COOH-CEW). The composite prepared
   was characterized with Fourier Transform Infrared analysis (FTIR),
   Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and thermogravimetric analysis
   (TGA). Further, the composite was evaluated by investigating the removal
   of Toluidine Blue O (TBO) fromaqueous solutions in batch conditions.
   Different operating parameters - coupling of CEW, shaking rate, initial
   pH, contact time, temperature, and dye concentration were studied.
   Fromthe results, maximum removal capacity and equilibrium association
   constant was determined to be 546.24 mg/g and 10.18 mg/mg, respectively
   at pH 10 and 298 K. The experimental data were well fitted to
   pseudo-second order model. Furthermore, desorption studies revealed that
   the adsorbed TBO can be completely eluted by using 50\% ethanol or 50\%
   glycerol in 1 M NaCl solution. Additionally, the reuse of P-COOH-CEW
   membrane reported to have 97.32\% of removal efficiency after five
   consecutive adsorption/desorption cycles. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Superior membrane distillation by induction heating of 3D rGO/Nafion/Ni
   foam for water treatment}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{616}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Membrane distillation (MD) is a promising green technology that can
   harness waste or solar heat to treat water. Since such heat sources
   suffer from temporal variations, a complementary, efficient means is
   necessary. Induction heating is attractive in providing localized
   heating at the feed-membrane interface where the heat matters, but the
   typical conductive materials (e.g., metal, alloy) corrode readily in the
   high-salinity, high-temperature environment. In this work, a superior
   induction material was proposed, namely, reduced graphene oxides (rGO)
   coated onto a porous Nickel foam by Nafion (rGO/Nafion/Ni), which
   exhibited superior and sustained performance for membrane distillation.
   Results indicate that rGO/Nafion/Ni achieved up to 28.1\% higher water
   flux (6.42 +/- 0.36 Lm(-2) h(-1)) and 37.5\% lower energy consumption
   (3.13 kWhL(-1)) compared to other carbon materials coated on Ni or the
   bare Ni foam. The mechanism underlying the enhanced MD performance was
   the higher absorption of the electromagnetic waves via multiple internal
   reflections and larger eddy currents generated by rGO, leading to higher
   temperatures at the feed-membrane interface that increased the driving
   force for distillation and thereby the energy efficiency of MD. Our work
   demonstrated that the induction heating of rGO has high potential for
   augmenting MD performance in water treatment.}},

   moral decision-making. Purpose-built digital tools can engender situated
   engagement with bioethical questions; can achieve such engagement at

Journal = {{BIOSENSORS \& BIOELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{170}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Due to increasing food safety standards, the analysis of mycotoxins has
   become essential in the food industry. In this work, we have developed a
   competitive upconversion-linked immunosorbent assay (ULISA) for the
   analysis of zearalenone (ZEA), one of the most frequently encountered
   mycotoxins in food worldwide. Instead of a toxin conjugate
   conventionally used in competitive immunoassays, we designed a ZEA
   mimicking peptide extended by a biotin-linker and confirmed its
   excellent suitability to mimic ZEA by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
   and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. Upconversion nanoparticles
   (UCNP, type NaYF4:Yb,Tm) served as background-free optical label for the
   detection of the peptide mimetic in the competitive ULISA.
   Streptavidinconjugated UCNPs were prepared by click reaction using an
   alkyne-PEG-neridronate linker. The UCNP conjugate clearly outperformed
   conventional labels such as enzymes or fluorescent dyes. With a limit of
   detection of 20 pg mL-1 (63 pM), the competitive ULISA is well
   applicable to the detection of ZEA at the levels set by the European
   legislation. Moreover, the ULISA is specific for ZEA and its metabolites
   (alpha and beta-zearalenol) without significant cross-reactivity with
   other related mycotoxins. We detected ZEA in spiked and naturally
   contaminated maize samples using liquid chromatography-tandem mass
   spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) as a reference method to demonstrate food
   analysis in real samples.}},

Title = {{First isolation and identification of red-grouper nervous necrosis virus

Abstract = {{With the sharp development of present aquaculture, outbreaks of viral
   diseases have become a major obstacle for the sustainable development of
   the aquaculture industry with massive economic losses. Viral
   encephalopathy and retinopathy (VER) represents one of the main viral
   threats to world aquaculture, which is caused by nervous necrosis virus
   (NNV). In the present study, a new RGNNV strain named RGNNV-HL was
   isolated from cultured adult hybrid Hulong grouper (Epinephelus
   fuscoguttatus(female) x Epinephelus lanceolatus(male)) in Guangdong
   province, China. Cell culture-based virus isolation, RT-PCR detection,
   tissue section, electron microscopy, and complete genome sequence were
   used for virus identification. Furthermore, an artificial infection
   experiment was conducted for virulence testing. Gross examination of
   affected fish showed no noticeable lesions, no parasites in the gills or
   on the body surfaces, and no pathogenic bacteria. Histopathological
   examination revealed severe vacuolations in the brain of diseased
   groupers. Inoculation of the tissue homogenates of diseased fish induced
   obvious cytopathic effects in SSN-1, GF-1, and GS cell cultures.
   Electron microscopic observation revealed the presence of small-sized
   icosahedral-shaped viral particles (similar to 30 nm) with no viral
   envelope, similar to betanodaviruses. RT-PCR and sequencing analysis
   confirmed the presence of red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus
   (RGNNV) capsid protein sequences. The virus clustered with RGNNV
   genotype, genus Betanodavirus within the Nodaviridae family on an
   evolutionary tree constructed based on the complete genome sequence.
   Thus, this newly isolated virus from adult Hulong grouper is tentatively
   designated RGNNV-HL. The artificial infection experiment showed that
   groupers began to die at 4 and 5 days after intraperitoneal injection
   and bath immersion, respectively. The cumulative mortality rates by
   injection and bath were 90\% and 83.33\%, respectively. To the best of
   our acknowledge, this is the first report of the isolation and
   characterization of RGNNV from Hulong grouper. Findings from this study
   will provide a candidate material and useful epidemiology information
   for further study on the infection mechanism and prevention and control
   strategies for RGNNV.}},

Title = {{Construction of hierarchical functionalized black phosphorus with
   polydopamine: A novel strategy for enhancing flame retardancy and
   mechanical properties of polyvinyl alcohol}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{402}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{As a rising star of two-dimensional (2D) materials, single or few-layer
   black phosphorus (BP) possess great potential as nanofiller in
   fabricating polymer nanocomposites, due to its thermodynamic stability,
   nano-size effect and structural characteristics. Herein, few-layer BP
   nanosheets were scalable exfoliated via solvent thermal method, the
   Lithium ion intercalation was achieved during this procedure. Follow by
   a polydopamine (PDA) encapsulated BP sandwich nanostructure was
   developed by oxidation-reduction strategy, which improved the air
   stability of few-layer BP and its interfacial compatibility with polymer
   matrix. As could be expected, the PDA encapsulated BP (BP-PDA) can
   effectively enhance the mechanical properties and flame retardancy of
   polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanocomposite films. For instance, the
   PVA/BP-PDA5.0 nanocomposite film loaded with 5 wt\% BP-PDA exhibited
   57.2\% maximum decrease in peak heat release rate and 47.9\% maximum
   reduction in total heat release. Meanwhile, while the BP-PDA loading
   achieved 2 wt\%, PVA/BP-PDA2.0 nano composite film revealed an 81.1\%
   increase in the tensile strength. In particular, on account of dual
   protection of the PDA encapsulation and polymer matrix embedding, the
   air stability of BP in PVA matrix was significantly improved. As an
   evidence, the ratio of A(g)(1)/A(g)(2) in Raman spectra of BP-PDA
   decreased from the initial 0.72 to 0.62, even after exposed to air for
   five months, indicating a low level of oxidation. This work provides a
   novel strategy for scalable exfoliation and functionalization of BP, and
   enables a wide range of potential applications of BP in polymer
   nanocomposites.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the automated fiber placement (AFP) manufacturing
   and high velocity impact response of hybrid pseudo-woven IM7/8552
   carbon/epoxy composite laminates. Three 24 ply laminate configurations
   are studied where pseudo-woven sub-laminates are combined with
   traditional layups on the inside and outside, along with a third
   quasi-isotropic control laminate {[}45/90/-45/0]3s. Pseudo-woven
   sub-laminates are manu-factured using a specialized in situ AFP process
   implementing tow skips. The pseudo-woven architecture is macroscopically
   heterogeneous with spatially varying fiber orientations both in-plane
   and through thickness resulting in multiple interfaces and an expanded
   design space. The impact experiments are performed according to ASTM
   D8101 in the range of 250-400 ft/s (76.2-121.92 m/s) using a single
   stage gas gun while utilizing digital image correlation and high-speed
   video to assess the laminate's response. Experimental results show that
   the hybridized configurations have a 45\% reduction in back face surface
   damage, 19.5\% less back face deflection and an increase of 5.5\% in V50

Title = {{Effect of part-length rods for different BWR subchannel geometries}},
Journal = {{NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{370}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Despite the beneficial effects of part-length rods (PLRs) in BWR fuel,
   they also introduce inhomogeneities to the coolant flow. These effects
   are hard to simulate and might affect cooling efficiency, dryout margin
   and CRUD deposition. So far, no fundamental experimental research was
   conducted to explore the details of their influence to the liquid film
   behavior in the dominating annular flow regime.
   To investigate the fluid dynamical effects of PLRs, we analyzed three
   different types of subchannel geometries. We varied the positions of
   PLRs in a pair of adjacent subchannels as well as the liquid and gas
   flow rates, staying within the annular flow regime. The adiabatic
   air-water test section was equipped with two types of sensors measuring
   the liquid film thickness distribution on half a fuel rod and on a fuel
   element wall. The measurement frequency was 10 kHz and the lateral
   resolution in the two-dimensional measuring domain was 2 mm. This
   corresponds to 64 x 16 and 16 x 32 measuring points, for rod and wall
   sensor respectively.
   Closely downstream of a PLR, we found a recirculation zone with less
   shear driving the liquid film. This is reflected by an increase of the
   average film thickness and a decrease of the wave velocity. A cross-flow
   of gas and liquid towards the open space downstream of the PLR was
   detected. The side of neighboring fuel rods facing this open space sees
   an increase of liquid flow. On the PLR-averted side, the coolant flow
   decreases, reducing the dryout margin. Further downstream, more gas
   tends to traverse into the open space left behind the PLR, which again
   increases the driving shear stress on the liquid film. The film becomes
   thinner and faster. The precise channel geometry featuring PLRs have a
   strong and complex influence on the local average liquid film thickness
   and the wave velocities. Their qualitative distribution at different
   flow conditions however, is similar. y}},

Abstract = {{A novel material and process was developed using fibre-reinforced
   powder-epoxy to produce unidirectional towpreg with a pilot-scale
   towpregging line, for cost-effective production of large composite
   structures for the renewable energy market, specifically for wind and
   tidal turbine blades. Electrostatic attraction was used to coat fibre
   tows with powder epoxy and either joule or radiant heating employed to
   heat and melt the polymer, followed by consolidation between rollers.
   Unidirectional carbon-fibre and basalt-fibre reinforced polymer
   laminates (UD-CFRP and UD-BFRP, respectively) were manufactured from the
   towpreg. Tensile test results showed that the towpregging process could
   be employed to achieve high performance UD-CFRP with 0 degrees tensile
   properties that are similar or better than commercially-available
   UD-CFRP systems. The competitive advantages of the powder-epoxy towpreg
   system include lower cost, better overall manufacturing control for
   vacuum-bag-only manufacturing and the ability to co-cure parts together
   at a later stage. Mechanical test results showed some variation between
   two types of UD-BFRP, but the results compared well with published data
   on UD-BFRP and equivalent glass-fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) systems.
   Finally, the influence of hygrothermal ageing due to water immersion on
   the tensile properties of the materials was investigated, with tests
   revealing that the water ageing effect was more severe in the case of
   UD-BFRP than for UD-CFRP.}},

Abstract = {{A strong topographical evidence of the 2D to 3D transition in InAs/GaAs
   nanostructures assembled by the submonolayer (SML) growth mode using
   molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is reported. Whereas the 2D to 3D
   transition in InAs nanostructures assembled by the Stranski-Krastanov
   (SK) growth mode is well established with a critical thickness of around
   1.7 monolayer (ML), the analogous phenomenon in SML-grown nanostructures
   is not yet well understood. Herein, atomic force microscopy (AFM) is
   utilized to investigate the topographical changes associated with the 2D
   to 3D transition in SML nanostructures, and it is unambiguously shown
   that for a given number of stacks and GaAs matrix (spacer) layer
   thickness, there exists a critical thickness in the amount of deposited
   InAs per cycle, beyond which the nucleation of 3D nanostructures
   abruptly begins. It is also shown that the critical thickness decreases
   with increasing number of stacks as well as with decreasing GaAs matrix
   layer thickness. Moreover, the present work shows that InAs/GaAs SML
   nanostructures exist in two distinct forms: 2D wetting layer (WL)-like
   islands and 3D quantum dot (QD)-like structures.}},

Title = {{SynCity: Using open data to create a synthetic city of hourly building
   energy estimates by integrating data-driven and physics-based methods}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{280}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Cities officials are increasingly interested in understanding spatial
   and temporal energy patterns of the built environment to facilitate
   their city's transition to a low-carbon future. In this paper, a new
   Augmented-Urban Building Energy Model (A-UBEM) is proposed that combines
   data-driven and physics-based simulation methods to produce synthetic
   hourly load curve estimates for every building within a city-similar to
   data an hourly smart meter would measure. By using only publicly
   available data, a generalizable two-step process is implemented-that
   other cities with similar available data can replicate-using New York
   City as a case study. Step (1) estimates the annual energy use for every
   building in the city using supervised machine learning algorithms. Step
   (2) extends these results and leverages physics-based simulation models
   through a convex optimization formulation that minimizes the squared
   difference between the aggregated building demand and the observed
   city-wide hourly electricity demand. Results from step (1) show that the
   Random Forest algorithm performs best with a mean log squared error of
   0.293, while the convex optimization in step (2) results in a mean
   training error of 6.11\% mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). To
   validate the stability of the produced load curves, Monte Carlo
   simulations are conducted, using random subsets of buildings from the
   city , which produce an out-of-sample error averaging 6.41\% MAPE across
   each simulation . Particle swarm optimization is also explored-using the
   results from the Monte Carlo simulation-to assess if the model could be
   improved by relaxing certain constraints, but marginal error reductions
   are found, further proving the stability of the proposed model. Overall,
   A-UBEM is a first step towards creating highly granular urban-scale
   synthetic hourly load curves solely using open data. Such load curves
   are integral for planning sustainable cities and accelerating the
   adoption of low-carbon distributed energy resources (DERs) and district
   energy systems.}},

Title = {{Single ventricle systolic function and cardiopulmonary exercise
   performance in adult patients with Fontan circulation}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Objective: We employed echocardiographic tissue characterization for the
   assessment of single ventricle systolic function and examined its
   relationship with cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) performance in
   the Fontan circulation.
   Methods: 40 consecutive adult Fontan patients (16 female, 24 male; mean
   age 26.3 +/- 5.9) were enrolled in our prospective cross-sectional
   study. All patients underwent echocardiographic assessment including
   tissue characterization and CPET within 3 days from each other.
   Results: LAPSE (lateral annular plane systolic excursion) was higher in
   patients with a dominant left ventricle compared to a dominant right
   ventricle (12.3 + -2.6 vs 9.8 + -1.1 mm, p =.008) and in patients with
   AP (right atrium-pulmonary artery) connection than with lateral tunnel
   or extracardiac conduits (13.9 +/- 1.7 vs 11.3 +/- 2.6 and 10.9 +/- 2.2
   mm, p =.014 and p =.014, respectively). Maximal oxygen pulse (O-2 pulse
   max) was significantly higher in patients with a dominant left or common
   ventricle compared to patients with a dominant right ventricle (10.3 and
   12.0 vs 6.6 ml/beat, p=.002 and p=.032, respectively). Therewas a
   positive correlation between O-2 pulse max and LAPSE (r= 0.442, p=.009),
   atrioventricular valve annulus systolic velocity (S') (r= 0.606, p
   <.0001), lateralwall basal segment systolic velocity (bas vel s) (r=
   0.469, p=.009) and lateral wall mid segment systolic velocity (mid vel
   s) (r = 0.452, p =.012). In the multivariable regression model, S' (r=
   0.606, p b.0001) remained predictive of O-2 pulse max.
   Conclusions: LAPSE and S' are suitable parameters for the assessment of
   systolic function in Fontan patients. Subclinical systolic dysfunction
   of longitudinal fibers is associated with worse CPET performance. O-2
   pulse max seems to be the best parameter reflecting Fontan patients'
   physical performance. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by a
   proinflammatory state with high mortality. Statins have
   anti-inflammatory effects and may attenuate the severity of COVID-19.
   Methods and Results
   An observational study of all consecutive adult patients with COVID-19
   admitted to a single center located in Bronx, New York, was conducted
   from March 1, 2020, to May 2, 2020. Patients were grouped as those who
   did and those who did not receive a statin, and in-hospital mortality
   was compared by competing events regression. In addition, propensity
   score matching and inverse probability treatment weighting were used in
   survival models to examine the association between statin use and death
   during hospitalization. A total of 4252 patients were admitted with
   COVID-19. Diabetes mellitus modified the association between statin use
   and in-hospital mortality. Patients with diabetes mellitus on a statin
   (n=983) were older (69 +/- 11 versus 67 +/- 14 years; P<0.01), had lower
   inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, 10.2; interquartile range,
   4.5-18.4 versus 12.9; interquartile range, 5.9-21.4 mg/dL; P<0.01) and
   reduced cumulative in-hospital mortality (24\% versus 39\%; P<0.01) than
   those not on a statin (n=1283). No difference in hospital mortality was
   noted in patients without diabetes mellitus on or off statin (20\%
   versus 21\%; P=0.82). Propensity score matching (hazard ratio, 0.88;
   95\% CI, 0.83-0.94; P<0.01) and inverse probability treatment weighting
   (HR, 0.88; 95\% CI, 0.84-0.92; P<0.01) showed a 12\% lower risk of death
   during hospitalization for statin users than for nonusers.
   Conclusions
   Statin use was associated with reduced in-hospital mortality from
   COVID-19 in patients with diabetes mellitus. These findings, if
   validated, may further reemphasize administration of statins to patients
   with diabetes mellitus during the COVID-19 era.}},

Abstract = {{The partial enzymatic hydrolysis of wheat gliadins constitutes an
   interesting tool to unravel their structural specificity. In this work,
   the structure and conformation of gamma-gliadin were investigated
   through its limited chymotrypsic digestion. Using a combination of
   computational, biochemical and biophysical tools, we studied each of its
   N and C terminal domains. Our results reveal that gamma-gliadin is a
   partially disordered protein with an unfolded N-terminal domain
   surprisingly resistant to chymotrypsin and a folded C-terminal domain.
   Using spectroscopic tools, we showed that structural transitions occured
   over the disordered N-terminal domain for decreasing ethanol/water
   ratios. Using SAXS measurements, low-resolution 3D structures of
   gamma-gliadin were proposed. To relate the repeated motifs of the
   N-terminal domain of gamma-gliadin to its structure, engineered peptide
   models PQQPY/F were also studied. Overall results demonstrated
   similarities between the N-terminal domain and its derived model
   peptides. Our findings support the use of these peptides as general
   templates for understanding the wheat protein assembly and dynamics. (C)

Abstract = {{Protein isolates were prepared from wet heat processed (APIp) and
   unprocessed alfalfa seeds (APIc) and characterized for composition and
   functionality at different pH. APIc and APIp exhibited high content of
   all the essential amino acids. Antinutrient content of APIp was lower in
   comparison to APIc and marked reduction in the trypsin inhibitor
   (85.97\%) and lectin activity (100\%) was observed. Processing did not
   cause much reduction of bioactive constituents and antioxidant activity
   of APIp. Alfalfa protein isolates exhibited complex polypeptide banding
   ranging from molecular weight of 11-75 kDa. APIp exhibited change in the
   conformation of protein discerned as alteration in interrelated nuances
   of ATR-FTIR spectra, XRD-pattern, morphology, charge on proteins and
   reduced solubility in comparison to APIc due to processing. APIp
   exhibited marked improvement in the functional properties in comparison
   to APIc discerned as improved hydration, surface active and gelation
   properties. Highest hydration and surface active properties were
   exhibited at pH 9.0, even though APIp at pH 7.0 showed fairly similar
   functional properties as APIc and APIp at pH 9.0. APIp exhibited reduced
   least gelation concentration in comparison to APIc at pH 7.0 and also
   engendered gelation at pH 4.0 and 9.0 contrary to APIc.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{276}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{A monolithic new attitude utilizing Aspen Plus software and Taguchi
   method has been applied to evaluate a novel configuration for removal of
   toxic heavy metals during sulfide ores recovery using potassium
   permanganate (KMnO4). In this new configuration, KMnO4 has been produced
   by sludge recovery of cobalt purification step containing manganese (IV)
   oxide (MnO2). Also, in this suggested configuration, the required
   sulfuric acid (H2SO4) solvent has been provided by recovery of sulfur
   compounds released during leaching process of sulfide ores. The optimum
   condition obtained by Taguchi experimental design has been used as
   initial data for the simulation and sensitivity analysis of process via
   Aspen Plus software. A systematic study of the design and operating
   condition has been made for key performance metrics such as removal of
   toxic heavy metal from sulfide ores, recovery of KMnO4 from sludge
   containing MnO2 and conversion of released sulfide gases to H2SO4 at the
   different operating condition such as H2SO4 concentration of 60-90 g/L,
   operating temperature of 60-150 degrees C, agitation rate of 100-400
   rpm, reaction time of 0.5-2 h, solid to liquid ratio of 1:1-1:4,
   particle size of 10-500 mu m, additive amount of 10-40 wt\% and oxygen
   pressure of 0.5-2 MPa. The optimum condition for removal of toxic heavy
   metal have been found to be H2SO4 concentration of 70 g/L, temperature
   of 90 degrees C, agitation rate of 200 rpm, reaction time of 1.5 h,
   particle size of 500 mu m, solid to liquid ratio of 1:2, additive amount
   of 40 wt\% and oxygen pressure of 1.5 MPa. According to simulation
   results, the maximum conversion of released sulfide gases to H2SO4,
   recovery of KMnO4 and toxic heavy metals removal during designed process
   at optimized condition are 98\%, 91\% and 99\%, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{In the quest for novel ceramics for tribological applications via
   bioinspired design, the differences in the fracture modes that arise
   upon scratching relevant locations of ceramic-like tooth enamel are
   investigated. It is found that fracture initiates from weak rod-sheath
   interfaces at relatively low loads, independent of the sliding
   direction. However, the geometry and propagation of the cracks depends
   on the orientation of the interfaces relative to the maximum tensile
   stress: scratching along the occlusal surface propagates approximately
   sinusoidal cracks, parallel to the sliding direction, while scratching
   along the cross-section produces straight cracks that propagate normal
   (scratch parallel to occlusal surface) or parallel (scratch
   perpendicular to occlusal surface) to the sliding direction. The
   formation of cracks is hindered in scratching near the enamel-dentine
   junction. Implications for the microstructural design of triboceramics
   (bulks and coatings) with improved durability are discussed.}},

Title = {{Postsynaptic damage and microglial activation in AD patients could be

Journal = {{BRAIN RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common forms of dementia
   with still unknown pathogenesis. Several cytokines and chemokines are
   involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Among the chemokines, the
   CXCR4/CXCL12 complex has been shown to play an important role in the
   pathogenetic development of AD.
   We investigated the expression levels of CXCR4 / CXCL12 in fifteen brain
   regions of healthy non-demented subjects (NDHC) (2139 sample) and AD
   patients (1170 sample) stratified according to sex and age. Furthermore,
   we correlated their expressions with the Neurogranin (NRGN) and CHI3L1
   levels, two inflamm-aging markers.
   We highlighted that CXCR4 gene expression levels were age-correlated in
   the brain of NDHC subjects and that AD nullified this correlation. A
   similar trend, but diametrically opposite was observed for CXCL12. Its
   expression was decreased during the aging in both sexes, and in the
   brains of AD patients, it underwent an inversion of the trend, only and
   exclusively in females. Brains of AD patients expressed high CXCR4 and
   CHI3L1, and low CXCL12 and Neurogranin levels compared to NDHC subjects.
   Both CXCR4 and CXCL12 correlated significantly with CHI3L1 and
   Neurogranin expression levels, regardless of disease. Furthermore, we
   showed a selective modulation of CXCL12 and CXCR4 only in specific brain
   regions.
   Taken together our results demonstrate that CXCL12 and CXCR4 are linked
   to Neurogranin and CHI3L1 expression levels and the relationship between
   postsynaptic damage and microglial activation in AD could be shown using
   all these genes. Further confirmations are needed to demonstrate the
   close link between these genes.}},

Abstract = {{Transdermal drug delivery is a technique used to introduce a drug
   through the skin and into the blood system. The drug-matrix hydrogels
   based on carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) were prepared by solution casting
   method using citric acid as the crosslinking agent at various amounts.
   The 5-fluorouracil, an anticancer non-ionic drug, was released from the
   CMC hydrogels under applied electrical field. The diffusion coefficient
   and the release mechanism of the drug of the CMC hydrogels were
   investigated by the modified Franz-diffusion cell with the PBS buffer
   solution at the pH value of 7.4 and at 37 degrees C for the duration of
   24 h. The effects of mesh size, electric potential, and electrode
   polarity were systematically investigated. The swelling test illustrated
   an increase in the mesh size with decreasing crosslinking agent. In
   addition, the drug diffusion coefficient increased with decreasing
   crosslinker: repeated groupmole ratio. The diffusion coefficient
   depended critically on the applied electric potential and the electrode
   polarity. The non-ionic drug release mechanisms were identified as the
   matrix deswelling and electroosmosis, in addition to the pure diffusion
   without electric field. Thus, CMC has been shown a potential bio-based
   matrix for electrically controlled non-ionic drug delivery. (C) 2020

Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{451}},
Pages = {{126-136}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Activities of daily living require simultaneous and coordinated
   activation of trunk and upper-limb segments, which involves complex
   interlimb interaction within the central nervous system. Although many
   studies have reported associations between activity of trunk and limb
   muscles during functional tasks, evidence on cortical and subcortical
   contributions to trunk-limb neural interactions is still not fully
   clear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine interactions
   between trunk and upper-limb muscles in the: (i) corticospinal circuits
   by using motor evoked potential (MEP) elicited through transcranial
   magnetic stimulation; and (ii) subcortical circuits by using
   cervicomedullary motor evoked potential (CMEP) elicited through
   cervicomedullary junction magnetic stimulation. Responses were evoked in
   the erector spinae (trunk) and flexor carpi radialis (upper-limb)
   muscles in twelve able-bodied individuals: (1) while participants were
   relaxed; (2) during trunk muscle contractions while arms were at rest;
   and (3) during upper-limb muscle contractions while the trunk was at
   rest. Our results showed that trunk muscle CMEP responses were not
   affected by upper-limb muscle contractions, while MEP responses were
   modulated. This indicates that at least the subcortical circuits may not
   attribute to facilitation of the trunk muscles during upper-limb
   contractions. On the other hand, in the upper-limb muscles, both CMEP
   and MEP responses were modulated during trunk contractions. These
   results indicate that cortical and subcortical mechanisms attributed to
   facilitation of upper-limb muscles during trunk contractions. In
   conclusion, our study demonstrated evidence that trunk-limb neural
   interactions may be attributed to cortical and/or subcortical mechanisms
   depending on the contracted muscle. (c) 2020 IBRO. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{High-efficiency solar energy is an emerging technology which can reduce
   greenhouse gas emissions. A four-terminal (4T) partial concentrator
   photovoltaic (CPVthorn) is a promising hybrid concept to maximize the
   electricity yield by integrating existing photovoltaic technologies.
   This paper describes the mathematical modeling of a 4T CPVthorn module
   for sun-tracking control optimization. The CPVthorn module consists of
   low-cost auxiliary solar cells placed around the concentrator
   multijunction solar cells. We derived a mathematical model to predict
   the generated power of the 4T CPVthorn module that incorporates
   inclination angle of array, location, date/time, lens optical
   efficiency, and solar irradiance data. The simulation revealed that the
   4T CPVthorn module with mono-facial auxiliary solar cells should always
   face toward the sun, similar to the conventional CPV modules, regardless
   of irradiance conditions. The short-term outdoor experiment using a

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The thermomechanical properties of the bio-fiber composite, as material
   for the production of thermal insulation panels, were evaluated. The
   observed mixtures were composed of Miscanthus x giganteus bio-fibers,
   mineral binders (cement or lime), pozzolanic materials (zeolite and fly
   ash), and water. The favorable heat transfer behavior of composites
   based on Miscanthus x giganteus bio-fibers was already affirmed by
   literature data of similar natural bio-fiber materials, the author's
   previous experimental results, and consideration of dynamic heat
   transfer processes in the insulated outer wall exposed to variable
   ambient conditions. The experimental assessment was focused on the
   bearing capacity (i.e. compressive and flexural strength), water
   absorption, and durability (i.e. resistance to freeze-thaw and
   carbonation), because there is scarce literature data regarding these
   properties, whose thorough understanding and systematization are highly
   important for a wider application of biomass-based thermal insulation
   materials. The obtained results were evaluated through the comparison to
   published data from similar bio-based thermal insulations, as well as
   from conventional thermo-insulation materials such as polystyrene and
   stone or glass wool. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{282}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The study aims to experimentally characterize the nano-particle
   emissions and un-regulated (i.e., saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons
   and formaldehyde emissions) emissions. Present study experimentally
   investigates the effect of high reactivity fuel injection timings and
   port-injected-fuel mass on nano-particle and unregulated emissions in
   the gasoline-diesel RCCI engine. Additionally, empirical correlations
   are developed using experimental data for the estimation of particle
   emission characteristics. An automotive single cylinder diesel engine is
   modified for an in-cylinder blending of port-injection of gasoline
   during suction stroke and direct-injection of diesel fuel during the
   compression stroke. The experiments are performed on a modified engine
   for various diesel injection timings and port-injected gasoline mass
   using development electronic control unit (ECU). Nano-particle and
   unregulated emissions are measured using electrical mobility based
   particle-sizer and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analyser
   respectively. Combustion analysis is performed by in-cylinder pressure
   measurement. The experimental data of nano-particle and combustion
   characteristics are used for the development of empirical correlation
   using a multivariable regression technique for determining the particle
   number characteristics. The parameters - premixing ratio, start of
   injection of diesel, and a novel parameter defined as premixed fraction
   of total heat release are used for the development of empirical
   correlations and found a good correlation for estimating the
   nano-particle emission characteristics. Results also indicate that
   advanced direct injection timing and increase in the port-injected
   gasoline mass leads to higher particle emissions as well as saturated,
   unsaturated hydrocarbon and formaldehyde emissions.}},

Title = {{Habitat selection by spotted owls after a megafire in Yosemite National
   park}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{478}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{As fires in the western United States have become larger and more severe
   over recent decades, understanding how the changing fire regime affects
   wildlife has become a key issue for conservation. Spotted owls (Strix
   occidentalis) associate with late-successional forest characteristics
   and therefore may be particularly sensitive to structural changes in
   habitat that result from fire. Previous studies have found varying
   responses of the owls to forest fire. We investigated the effects of the
   2013 Rim Fire on territory selection by California spotted owls within
   Yosemite National Park, which, unlike the surrounding landscape, has
   been managed with no commercial logging since the early 1900s and
   minimal fire suppression since the 1970s. We examined specific habitat
   characteristics associated with spotted owl presence before and after
   the fire to understand how fire-induced changes in habitat structure may
   influence spotted owl territory selection. Spotted owls persisted and
   nested within the fire perimeter throughout the four post-fire years of
   our study at rates similar to what we observed in areas of Yosemite that
   were unaffected by the fire. However, within the fire perimeter, spotted
   owls avoided areas characterized by > 30\% percent high severity fire.
   Prior to the fire, spotted owls selected for areas of high canopy cover
   relative to the rest of the landscape; after the fire, even though
   territory centers shifted substantially from pre-fire locations,
   pre-fire canopy cover remained a stronger predictor of spotted owl
   presence than post-fire canopy cover, or any other pre- or post-fire
   habitat variables we assessed. The importance of prefire forest
   structure in predicting owl presence after fire suggests that reported
   variation in spotted owl population response to different fires across
   the Sierra Nevada may in part reflect variation in pre-fire forest
   characteristics, and perhaps different forest management regimes that
   shaped those characteristics. Pre-fire forest characteristics may impart
   a legacy of post-fire habitat conditions important to owls that commonly
   used forest and fire metrics do not effectively describe. Further study
   of owl response to fire in forests with a broader spectrum of pre-fire
   forest structure and management regimes is needed to better predict and
   manage effects of the changing fire regime on spotted owls.}},

Title = {{Olfactory response as a marker for Alzheimer's disease: Evidence from
   perceptual and frontal lobe oscillation coherence deficit}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{High-frequency oscillations of the frontal cortex are involved in
   functions of the brain that fuse processed data from different sensory
   modules or bind them with elements stored in the memory. These
   oscillations also provide inhibitory connections to neural circuits that
   perform lower-level processes. Deficit in the performance of these
   oscillations has been examined as a marker for Alzheimer's disease (AD).
   Additionally, the neurodegenerative processes associated with AD, such
   as the deposition of amyloid-beta plaques, do not occur in a spatially
   homogeneous fashion and progress more prominently in the medial temporal
   lobe in the early stages of the disease. This region of the brain
   contains neural circuitry involved in olfactory perception. Several
   studies have suggested that olfactory deficit can be used as a marker
   for early diagnosis of AD. A quantitative assessment of the performance
   of the olfactory system can hence serve as a potential biomarker for
   Alzheimer's disease, offering a relatively convenient and inexpensive
   diagnosis method. This study examines the decline in the perception of
   olfactory stimuli and the deficit in the performance of high-frequency
   frontal oscillations in response to olfactory stimulation as markers for
   AD. Two measurement modalities are employed for assessing the olfactory
   performance: 1) An interactive smell identification test is used to
   sample the response to a sizable variety of odorants, and 2)
   Electroencephalography data are collected in an olfactory perception
   task with a pair of selected odorants in order to assess the
   connectivity of frontal cortex regions. Statistical analysis methods are
   used to assess the significance of selected features extracted from the
   recorded modalities as Alzheimer's biomarkers. Olfactory decline
   regressed to age in both healthy and mild AD groups are evaluated, and
   single- and multi-modal classifiers are also developed. The novel
   aspects of this study include: 1) Combining EEG response to olfactory
   stimulation with behavioral assessment of olfactory perception as a
   marker of AD, 2) Identification of odorants most significantly affected
   in mild AD patients, 3) Identification of odorants which are still
   adequately perceived by mild AD patients, 4) Analysis of the decline in
   the spatial coherence of different oscillatory bands in response to
   olfactory stimulation, and 5) Being the first study to quantitatively
   assess the performance of olfactory decline due to aging and AD in the
   Iranian population.}},

Title = {{High-efficiency synthesis of large-area monolayer WS2 crystals on
   SiO2/Si substrate via NaCl-assisted atmospheric pressure chemical vapor
   deposition}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE}},

Abstract = {{Synthesis of monolayer WS2 crystals on SiO2/Si substrate has attracted
   interests due to the advantage of fabrication of field effect transistor
   without WS2 transfer process. Although substantial efforts have been
   achieved in recent years, controllable synthesis of uniform and
   large-area monolayer WS2 crystals on SiO2/Si substrate is still
   challenging. Herein, we report an elegant method to synthesize monolayer
   WS2 crystals on SiO2/Si substrate by using NaCl as a growth promoter in
   one semi-sealed quartz tube. It is found that triangular monolayer WS2
   with edge lengths ranged from 10 to 460 mu m can be readily synthesized
   within 5 min of growth by adjusting the growth temperature and weight
   ratio of NaCl and WO3. The Raman mapping results indicate that the
   as-synthesized WS2 crystals exhibit homogeneous distributions of the
   crystallinity, electron doping and residual strain across the entire
   triangular domains regardless of their dimensions. However, the smaller
   WS2 crystals exhibit a higher electron doping and less residual strain
   compared to the larger one obtained under the same growth conditions.
   Importantly, the amount of WO3 used in this study is three orders lower
   than the commonly reported one and the semi-sealed quartz tube can be
   reused more than 50 times after mildly cleaning.}},

Abstract = {{Polypropylene (PP) meshes are the most widely used as hernioplasty
   prostheses. As far as hernia repair is concerned, bacterial
   contamination and tissue adhesion would be the clinical issues.
   Moreover, an optimal mesh should assist the healing process of hernia
   defect and avoid undesired prosthesis displacements. In this present
   study, the commercial hernia mesh was modified to solve the mentioned
   problems. Accordingly, a new bifunctional PP mesh with anti-adhesion and
   antibacterial properties on the front and adhesion properties (reduce
   undesired displacements) on the backside was prepared. The backside of
   PP mesh was coated with polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofibers modified by
   mussel-inspired L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) bioadhesive. The
   front side was composed of two different nanofibrous mats, including
   hybrid and two-layered mats with different antibacterial properties,
   drug release, and biodegradation behavior, which were based on PCL
   nanofibers and biomacromolecule carboxyethyl-chitosan (CECS)/polyvinyl
   alcohol (PVA) nanofibers containing different ofloxacin amounts. The
   anti-adhesion, antibacterial, and biocompatibility studies were done
   through in-vitro experiments. The results revealed that DOPA coated
   PCL/PP/hybrid meshes containing ofloxacin below 20 wt\% possessed proper
   cell viability, AdMSCs adhesion prevention, and excellent antibacterial
   efficiency. Moreover, DOPA modifications not only enhanced the surface
   properties of the PP mesh but also improved cell adhesion, spreading,
   and proliferation. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on different configurations
   under various light intensity are characterized, where commercial N719
   dye and synthesized D-Dye are used as photo-sensitizer. Regardless of
   cell configuration, organic D-Dye serves as an efficient
   photo-sensitizer, giving rise to high cell efficiency comparable with
   N719. The highest efficiency of 20.98\% (V-oc of 0.6 V, J(sc) of 0.62
   mA/cm(2), FF of 0.71) is achieved as the front-illuminated rigid DSSC is
   constructed by applying 8 mu m TiO2 layer under 6000 LUX illumination.
   At the same condition the efficiency of 19.69\% (V-oc of 0.63 V, J(sc)
   of 0.57 mA/cm(2), FF of 0.74) is recorded for N719. Higher efficiency
   for D-Dye is attributed to high response of its absorption spectrum to
   the emission spectrum of indoor T5 irradiance. Charge transfer
   resistance is measured to be 53.1 Omega for D-Dye in conjunction with 8
   mu m TiO2 which is higher than thicker TiO2 (10 mu m and 12 mu m) at
   0.75 V applied bias under dark condition, indicating that reduction of
   TiO2 thickness facilitates charge transfer by suppressing charge
   recombination under low illuminations. A systematic study of the
   efficiency as a function of key factors like TiO2 thickness, electrode
   type, and light intensity is explored.}},

Abstract = {{Cutaneous wounds frequently require the use of patches to promote
   healing, nevertheless, most commercial products are fabricated with
   non-biodegradable synthetic substrates that pose environmental problems
   upon disposal. Herein, the partnership between two biobased nanofibrous
   polymers, namely a polysaccharide (nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC)) and
   a protein (lysozyme nanofibers (LNFs)), is explored to design
   sustainable fibrous patches with good mechanical performance and
   biological functionalities for wound healing applications. Two patches
   with different morphologies were prepared by vacuum filtration of a
   water-based suspension of both nanofibers and by sequential filtration
   of the separated suspensions (layered patch). The resultant freestanding
   patches exhibited high thermal stability (up to 250 degrees C),
   mechanical performance (Young's modulus >= 3.7 GPa), and UV-barrier
   properties. The combination of the bioactive LNFs with the mechanically
   robust NFC conveyed antioxidant activity (76-79\% DPPH scavenging) and
   antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (3.5-log CFU mL(-1)
   reduction), which is a major benefit to prevent microbial wound
   infections. Moreover, these patches are biocompatible towards L929
   fibroblast cells, and the in vitro wound healing assay evidenced a good
   migration capacity leading to an almost complete wound occlusion.
   Therefore, the partnership between the two naturally derived nanofibrous
   polymers represents a potential blueprint to engineer sustainable
   multifunctional patches for cutaneous wound healing. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Let L = partial derivative(t) + a(x)partial derivative(x) be a real
   vector field defined on the two-dimensional torus T-2, where a is a
   real-valued and smooth function on T-1. We deal with the global
   solvability of equations in the form Lu + pu = f, where p, f is an
   element of C-infinity(T-2). Solvability to the equation Lu = f is
   well-understood. We show that a perturbation of zero order may affect
   the global solvability of L; we may maintain, gain or lose solvability
   by adding a perturbation. This phenomenon is linked to the order of
   vanishing of the coefficient a of L. We obtained results in the class of
   smooth functions on T-2 and, also, in the space of Schwartz
   distributions D'(T-2). (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to evaluate the effects of pregelatinization in
   improving delayed release characteristics of native chapparada avare

   evaluated for the native and pregelatinized starches using established
   methods. The moisture content decreased from12.13 +/- 0.15\% to 8.73 +/-
   0.12\%, whereas amylose content (6.91 +/- 0.06-21.13 +/- 0.03), swelling
   power and water holding capacity (211.04 +/- 0.03-513.03 +/- 0.03)
   showed steady risewith pregelatinization time. The result of X ray
   diffraction pattern for pregelatinized starch, showed absence of 18.4
   degrees and 23.2 degrees 2. peaks thereby indicating reducing
   crystallinity, compared to native starch, whereas FESEM micrograph
   showed complete disruption of granular structure due to
   pregelatinization of native starch. The in vitro dissolution studies
   conducted in gastric and intestinal pHshowed that tablets preparedwith
   both native (NPL) andmodified starch (PG15, PG20, PG 25), are gastro
   protective with less than 25\% drug release in pH 1.2. In pH 6.8, PG 20
   and PG 25 showed optimum drug release of 21.23 +/- 0.54\% and 19.40 +/-
   0.48\% respectively in 6 h compared to 42.52 +/- 0.21\% release of NPL

Abstract = {{This article presents the design, implementation, and characterisation

   with high localisation accuracy in both steering axes enables ultra-high
   data rate transmission and practical indoor coverage. The auto-aligned
   terminals have a tracking accuracy of 0.02(o), a full angle
   field-of-view (FoV) of 50(o), a tracking latency of 200 ms, and work at
   wavelengths between 1300-1700 nm. In an offline data processing
   experimental setup, 1 Tbit/s free-space transmission capability is
   demonstrated over a 2.54 m(2) coverage area using ten wavelength
   division multiplexed PAM-4 signals. Further, full-duplex, real-time,
   data transmission using off-the-shelf small form-factor pluggable (SFP)
   optical transceivers is also demonstrated for virtual reality (VR)
   application. Here, using standard 10 G SFP+ transceivers without the use

   achieve 4.9 m(2) localisation and 3.14 m(2) bidirectional communications
   coverage over a range of similar to 4 m.}},

Abstract = {{Chitin was collected and extracted along different lifecycle stages of
   the Black Soldier Fly (BSF) (larvae, prepupae, pupae, flies, shedding \&
   cocoons). The chitin content in the collected biomass ranged between 8\%
   and 24\%, with sheddings and cocoons being most rich in chitin. Purified
   chitin was subjected to a physicochemical evaluation based on FTIR, XRD,
   and TGA as well as a deacetylation step. The data indicated that BSF
   chitin was alpha-chitin with FTIR profiles matching closely to shrimp
   chitin and showing some differences compared to squid pen chitin
   (beta-chitin). Small physicochemical differences were observed among the
   different BSF samples. Prepupae and cocoon chitin was more crystalline
   while chitin from larvae and sheddings had a lower thermal degradation
   temperature. In addition, sheddings were more difficult to purify.
   Further processing to chitosan showed that a deacetylation degree of
   89\% could be obtained for all samples after 3 h, although sheddings
   were found to be less reactive in the deacetylation process. Overall,
   the small differences in physicochemical properties that were detected
   between the BSF chitin samples did not prevent further processing of
   chitin to chitosan with the same degree of deacetylation via the same
   treatment. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{Morphology and phase distributions of molten core in a reactor vessel}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{542}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Investigations on the morphology and phase equilibrium characteristics
   of corium were performed by a series of experiments in parallel with
   thermodynamic phase equilibrium analyses. Melting and solidification
   experiments were performed using corium consists of U, Zr, ZrO2, SS, and
   B4C. TROI-49 and TROI-50 experiments with corium compositions
   representing Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR), whose compositions are
   similar to those of MA-3 and MA-4 of OECD MASCA (Material Scaling)
   Program while amount of mass is 5 times more, resulted in two-layered
   structure with oxide rich layer on top of metal rich layer. Experiments
   of FK-1 and FK- 2 with a mixture of UO(2)2, ZrO2, Zr, SS and B4C at a
   representative Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) corium
   composition resulted in a formation two-layered structure of corium with
   upper layer rich in metal and lower layer rich in oxide. Zirconium
   diboride phase trapped boron and mainly distributed in the metallic
   layer. Predictions by thermodynamic calculations for the equilibrium
   phase distribution and chemical compositions of each phase using the
   NUCLEA thermodynamic database with a focus on U-Zr-O-Fe system were in
   good agreement with the experimental results. Agreement in terms of
   U/(U+ Zr) was quite close while there were dispersions in oxygen and
   steel components. The temperatures for the formation of two immiscible
   liquids calculated by the NUCLEA for FK-1 and FK-2 was 300 K higher than
   the experimental observation. This point has to be looked at for
   improving the NUCLEA models for corium containing B4C, by introducing a
   non-zero boron solubility in the ceramic phase. The agreement between
   the NUCLEA predictions and the results of experiments clearly indicate
   that thermodynamic equilibrium phases play an important role in
   governing the core damage progression, which is important not only for
   the severe accident management but also for decommissioning and
   defueling process for the Fukushima Daiich damaged reactors. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{The standard gamma process is widely used for degradation modelling when
   the degradation paths are always positive and strictly increasing.
   Nevertheless, the standard gamma process is considered inappropriate if
   the observed sample paths are horizontal over several time intervals.
   Motivated by this phenomenon, we develop a time-discrete and
   zero-adjusted gamma process model. Statistical inference method of this
   model is then proposed. To illustrate our proposed model, both
   simulation study and real data analysis are conducted, whose results
   demonstrate that the proposed model has satisfactory fit performance and

Abstract = {{A carbon cloth@TiO2@Ag (CC@TiO2@Ag) membrane has been prepared by
   two-step method, including the hydrothermal method to make TiO2 grow on

   the good superhydrophilicity and underwater superoleophobicity due to
   its hierarchical broccoli-like interface with the good surface roughness
   and the natural hydrophilicity of TiO2. Importantly, the resultant
   membrane exhibits a strong self-cleaning ability under visible light
   irradiation of CC@TiO2@Ag membrane with loading a certain amount of Ag,
   so that the separation efficiency remains above 99\% even after 60
   cycles for various oil-water mixtures. Moreover, the CC@TiO2@Ag membrane
   is flexible and durable. The high separation efficiency and excellent
   self-cleaning ability of the membrane may own the broad application
   prospects in the field of oil-water separation.}},

   nanoparticles in Isatis cappadocica}},
Journal = {{ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{206}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Widespread arsenic (As) contamination is a severe environmental and
   public health concern. Isatis cappadocica, an arsenic hyperaccumulator,
   holds great potential to clean up As-contaminated soil and groundwater.
   Iron oxide is one of the most common metal oxides in the natural
   environment and its nanoparticulate form has been previously utilized
   for the removal of heavy metals/metalloids from wastewater. However,
   there is a paucity of information on the impact of iron oxide
   nanoparticles on the growth and physiological properties of I.
   cappadocica and its effectiveness on As removal. Current study reports
   for the first time the impact of superparamagnetic iron oxide
   nanoparticles and glutathione (GSH) modified superparamagnetic iron
   oxide nanoparticles (nFe(3)O(4) and nFe(3)O(4)@GSH) on the physiological
   characteristic of I. cappadocica and its accumulation of As under
   hydroponic condition. nFe(3)O(4)@GSH alleviated the harmful impact of As
   and significantly increased the shoot biomass of I. cappadocica by
   enhancing the plant defense mechanisms. The application of GSH,
   nFe(3)O(4) and nFe(3)O(4)@GSH all lowered the As concentration in plant
   shoots as a protective mechanism. However, the substantial shoot biomass
   increase due to nFe(3)O(4)@GSH resulted in a 56\% higher As accumulation
   in plant shoots than in plants exposed to As alone, indicating the
   strong effectiveness of nFe(3)O(4)@GSH as a novel enhancer of the As
   phytoremediation by I. cappadocica. Our data further showed that the
   beneficial effect of nFe(3)O(4)@GSH on As phytoremediation is due to the
   enhancement of activities of several enzymatic and nonenzymatic
   antioxidants.}},

Title = {{COVID-19: Spatial analysis of hospital case-fatality rate in France}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{When the population risk factors and reporting systems are similar, the
   assessment of the case-fatality (or lethality) rate (ratio of cases to
   deaths) represents a perfect tool for analyzing, understanding and
   improving the overall efficiency of the health system. The objective of
   this article is to estimate the influence of the hospital care system on
   lethality in metropolitan France during the inception of the COVID-19
   epidemic, by analyzing the spatial variability of the hospital
   case-fatality rate (CFR) between French districts. In theory, the
   hospital age-standardized CFR should not display significant differences
   between districts, since hospital lethality depends on the virulence of
   the pathogen (the SARS-CoV-2 virus), the vulnerability of the population
   (mainly age-related), the healthcare system quality, and cases and
   deaths definition and the recording accuracy. We analyzed hospital data
   on COVID-19 hospitalizations, severity (admission to intensive care
   units for reanimation or endotracheal intubation) and mortality, from
   March 19 to May 8 corresponding to the first French lockdown. All rates
   were age-standardized to eliminate differences in districts age
   structure. The results show that the higher case-fatality rates observed
   by districts are mostly related to the level of morbidity. Time analysis
   shows that the case-fatality rate has decreased over time, globally and
   in almost all districts, showing an improvement in the management of
   severe patients during the epidemic. In conclusion, it appears that
   during the first critical phase of COVID-19 ramping epidemic in
   metropolitan France, the higher case-fatality rates were generally
   related to the higher level of hospitalization, then potentially related
   to the overload of healthcare system. Also, low hospitalization with
   high case-fatality rates were mostly found in districts with low
   population density, and could due to some limitation of the local
   healthcare access. However, the magnitude of this increase of
   case-fatality rate represents less than 10 per cent of the average
   case-fatality rate, and this variation is small compared to much greater
   variation across countries reported in the literature.}},

   associated problems (e.g., intimate partner violence, financial
   difficulties).
   Results:
   The ADHD-Persist group reported that their partners exhibited more ADHD
   symptoms than the ADHD-Desist group and those without ADHD. Adults in
   the ADHD-Persist group who had partners with elevated ADHD symptoms
   endorsed high intimate partner violence and financial difficulties.
   Conclusion:
   Assortative mating appears to be common among adults with ADHD,
   especially those with persistent symptoms, and to increase risk of
   additional problems.}},

Abstract = {{Young people born with variations in sex characteristics (VSC) or
   disorders of sex development (DSD) face numerous challenges in
   navigating issues relating to identity and to their lived and embodied
   experience. There is limited published research amplifying the voices of
   young people with a VSC, especially from Aotearoa/New Zealand. This
   qualitative study provides an up-to-date picture of the lived experience
   of 10 young people with a VSC in Aotearoa/New Zealand. The research was
   conducted in collaboration with the advocacy group, Intersex Youth
   Aotearoa, and explored the level of support provided by health services,
   peers and advocacy groups in relation to the ways the participants
   viewed themselves and their bodies, and their health related
   decision-making. Findings reveal the pressure on young people with a VSC
   to conform to cultural and societal norms, specifically, heteronormative
   and traditional constructs of how male and female bodies should look in
   Aotearoa/NZ society. Such views, often held and perpetuated by health
   professionals and parents, contributed to complexities surrounding
   identity, agency and acceptance of difference experienced by these young
   people. The implications of these findings are discussed, including the
   need for better psychological and peer support for young people.}},

Abstract = {{Objective
   To assess the risk of incident epilepsy among participants with
   prevalent dementia and the risk of incident dementia among participants
   with prevalent epilepsy in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS).
   Methods
   We analyzed prospectively collected data in the Original and Offspring
   FHS cohorts. To determine the risk of developing epilepsy among
   participants with dementia and the risk of developing dementia among
   participants with epilepsy, we used separate, nested, case-control
   designs and matched each case to 3 age-, sex- and FHS cohort-matched
   controls. We used Cox proportional hazards regression analysis,
   adjusting for sex and age. In secondary analysis, we investigated the
   role of education level and APOE e4 allele status in modifying the
   association between epilepsy and dementia.
   Results
   A total of 4,906 participants had information on epilepsy and dementia
   and dementia follow-up after age 65. Among 660 participants with
   dementia and 1,980 dementia-free controls, there were 58 incident
   epilepsy cases during follow-up. Analysis comparing epilepsy risk among
   dementia cases vs controls yielded a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.82 (95\%
   confidence interval 1.05-3.16, p = 0.034). Among 43 participants with
   epilepsy and 129 epilepsy-free controls, there were 51 incident dementia
   cases. Analysis comparing dementia risk among epilepsy cases vs controls
   yielded a HR of 1.99 (1.11-3.57, p = 0.021). In this group, among
   participants with any post-high school education, prevalent epilepsy was
   associated with a nearly 5-fold risk for developing dementia (HR 4.67
   {[}1.82-12.01], p = 0.001) compared to controls of the same educational
   attainment.
   Conclusions
   There is a bi-directional association between epilepsy and dementia.
   with either condition carrying a nearly 2-fold risk of developing the
   other when compared to controls.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a semi-implicit spectral deferred correction (SDC)
   method for incompressible Navier-Stokes problems with variable viscosity
   and time-dependent boundary conditions. The proposed method integrates
   elements of velocity- and pressure-correction schemes, which yields a
   simpler pressure handling and a smaller splitting error than the SDPC
   method of Minion and Saye (2018) {[}65]. Combined with the discontinuous
   Galerkin spectral-element method for spatial discretization it can in
   theory reach arbitrary order of accuracy in time and space. Numerical
   experiments in three space dimensions demonstrate up to order 12 in time
   and 17 in space for constant as well as varying, solution-dependent
   viscosity. Compared to SDPC the present method yields a substantial
   improvement of accuracy and robustness against order reduction caused by
   time-dependent boundary conditions. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Decryption of favourable haplotypes and potential candidate genes for
   five fibre quality properties using a relatively novel genome-wide
   association study procedure in upland cotton}},
Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{158}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{To understand the genetic basis of crop economic characteristics,
   identifying whole-genome quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in breeding
   resources via genome-wide association studies (GWASs) is important, but
   conventional GWAS procedures have mainly concentrated on identifying
   regions of major QTLs. In this study, to reveal wholegenome QTLs
   controlling cotton fibre quality traits, a total of 1,236,418
   single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were explored in a natural
   population of 315 upland cotton accessions using the specific-locus
   amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) method, and 13,391 high-quality
   SNPs were organized into 9244 SNP linkage disequilibrium blocks
   (SNPLDBs) to develop molecular markers with multiple haplotypes/alleles.
   A relatively novel procedure for restricted two-stage multi-locus
   multi-allele GWAS (RTM-GWAS) involving two methods was applied,
   including multiple environments and four single environments. In total,
   75, 77, 66, 66, and 60 significant SNPLDBs associated with the upper
   half mean length (UHML), fibre strength (FS), fibre micronaire (FM),
   fibre uniformity index (FUI), and fibre elongation (FE), respectively,
   were identified via the multipleenvironment RTM-GWAS method. Based on
   these results, the haplotype/allele effects of the significant SNPLDB
   loci were estimated, and QTL-allele matrices were established to provide
   the abbreviated genetic composition of the population. Most importantly,
   nine stable SNPLDB loci were simultaneously detected in multiple
   environments and two or more single test environments with large-lg(P)
   values and percentages of explained phenotypic variation. Furthermore,
   favourable haplotypes/alleles of the nine stable SNPLDB loci were
   identified, and 79 potential candidate genes related to UHML and FS
   traits were predicted from RNA-seq data. Favourable haplotypes/alleles,
   potential candidate genes and QTL-allele matrices can offer important
   insights into the genetic basis of fibre quality traits in upland cotton
   and may facilitate the breeding of cotton varieties with excellent fibre
   quality properties.}},

   performances and hydrothermal stabilities}},
Journal = {{MICROPOROUS AND MESOPOROUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{309}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Cu-SSZ-13 and Cu-SAPO-34, both with CHA topology but different
   compositions, are highly active NH3-SCR catalysts for the abatement of
   harmful nitrogen oxides from the exhausts of lean-burn engines. However,
   the former suffers from high preparation cost and worse high-temperature
   hydrothermal stability, and the latter is limited by its poor
   low-temperature hydrothermal stability. Herein, a new Cu-CHA composite
   (named Cu-CHA(DNL)) containing both microenvironments of SSZ-13 and
   SAPO-34 was synthesized by employing one-pot synthesized Cu-SSZ-13 as Cu
   source, seeds and part of Si/Al source. The resultant materials have
   cubic-like morphology, high Si contents, controllable Cu loadings and
   uniform Si/P/Al/Cu elemental distributions. Solid state MAS NMR,
   NH3-DRIFTS and H-2-TPR demonstrate the coexistence of aluminosilicate
   and SAPO zones in the Cu-CHA(DNL) crystals. Notably, Cu-CHA(DNL)
   exhibits high NH3-SCR activity in wide temperature window and robust
   resistance against both steaming at 800 degrees C and soaking in 80
   degrees C water. These advantages are owing to the unique composite
   microstructures of Cu-CHA(DNL) and suggest the material has huge
   application potential in deNO(x) process.}},

Title = {{Rendering the hidden visible: subjected to ``work on the self{''} in a
   local labour market measure}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL ETHNOGRAPHY}},
Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this article is to complement the literature
   understanding present labour market measures as infused by a so-called
   neoliberal rationality, fostering self-managerial selves by means of
   self-inspection. It does so by providing a much-needed illustration of
   how such ``work on the self{''} is achieved in practice.
   Design/methodology/approach The analysis draws on ethnographic fieldwork
   tracing the ``active society{''} at the local level, depicting practices
   aimed at activating welfare clients in a local labour market measure
   organised in a rural Swedish municipality. Here, the author was offered
   to undergo a method aimed at enhancing participants' employability. As a
   result, data consists of ethnographic as well as auto-ethnographic
   accounts from this experience. Findings This analysis shows how
   destabilisation of subjectivity was central to the remoulding of
   individuals into employable and self-reliant selves. Moreover, by
   dispersing responsibility to the individual, it is shown how the
   organisation was able to refrain from accountability, hence reducing the
   levels of uncertainty and ambiguity that is part and parcel of
   people-processing welfare organisations. Practical implications The
   article concludes with the warning that, in the wake of ``local worlds
   of activation{''}, municipalities may sometimes draw on questionable
   assumptions of the human mind and behaviour, as well as the
   vulnerability of individuals' self-understanding, as a way of managing
   the ``active society{''} at the local level. Originality/value The
   literature on activation lacks ethnographic accounts depicting concrete
   practices of turning the socially excluded into active and employable
   selves. Here, this article offers an illustrating example of such
   practices in action.}},

Abstract = {{Disentangling the role of natural and anthropogenic factors is a major
   challenge in paleofire studies. Here, we introduce the molecular
   biomarkers of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs), combined with
   charcoal and black carbon in sediments of archaeological sites, to
   identify anthropogenic signals of environmental change during the middle
   Holocene. In the prehistoric period, an intensified-fire regime period,
   inferred on the basis of PAHs, char and macro-charcoal levels, has been
   attributed to intensified anthropogenic biomass burning from dry crop
   cultivation between 6500 and 5000 and 3900-3600 yr BP., corresponding to
   the earliest Chinese settlements during the Miaodigou \& Banpo IV
   Culture and the development of the Erlitou Culture under drier climate
   conditions. Subsequently, the fire frequency decreased notably between
   4500 and 4000 yr BP. as the climate became wetter and there were shifts
   in the frequency of high-magnitude floods, corresponding to the
   abandonment of late Neolithic settlements in the floodplain. Changes in
   the PAH fluxes in sediments are positively correlated with
   intensified-fire regime periods, consistent with the charcoal and black
   carbon fluxes during those periods. Principal component analysis of PAH
   fluxes suggests that these intensified-fire events have a pyrogenic
   signature, implying that the PAHs were derived from biomass burning of
   fuelwood and other woody plants. In this study, PAHs in loess sediments
   have been used as the indicators of anthropogenic biomass burning
   through time. Meanwhile, PAHs also record the shift of modes of
   production and the evolution of human settlements as well as the choices
   made in response to limited natural resources. To comprehensively
   analyze the paleofire records of PAHs, charcoal and black carbon
   combined with multiproxy evidence are needed to understand wildfire
   history as well as human land use and social and cultural development
   across the study regions in depth.}},

Abstract = {{Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs), comprising lithium fluorinated
   sulfonimide including Li{[}(FSO2)(RFSO2)N] (R-F = n-CmF2m+1, m = 0
   (LiFSI), 1 (LiFTFSI), 2 (LiFPFSI), and 4 (LiFNFSI)) and
   Li{[}(CF3SO2)(2)N] (LiTFSI) as conducting salt and poly(ethylene oxide)
   (PEO) as polymer matrix, are utilized for investigating the impact of
   anionic structure of lithium salt on the performances of rechargeable
   lithium metal (Li) batteries (RLMBs), through comparing their
   fundamental physical properties, including ionic conductivity and anodic
   stability, and electrochemical performances for Li parallel to Li and Li
   parallel to LiFePO4 cells. It is found that the cycling stabilities of
   both the Li anode and LiFePO4 cathode are highly dependent on the
   structure of fluorinated imide anion. The cycling stabilities for both
   the Li parallel to Li and Li parallel to LiFePO4 cells with
   Li{[}(FSO2)(RFSO2)N] systematically outperfom those with LiTFSI at 0.2
   mA cm(-2) and 80 degrees C (i.e., being increased in the order of LiTFSI
   < LiFTFSI, LiFPFSI < LiFSI < LiFNFSI for Li parallel to Li cells, and in
   the order of LiTFSI < LiFSI, LiFTFSI < LiFPFSI < LiFNFSI for Li parallel
   to LiFePO4 cells). Specifically, LiFNFSI exhibits the best compatibility
   toward Li anode and the strongest anodic stability, thus making the Li
   parallel to LiFePO4 cell display the outstanding cycling stability
   (e.g., 80.8\% capacity retention after 570 cycles at 1.0C and 80 degrees
   C). All the above results suggest that the structure of sulfonimide
   anion of lithium salt tailored for SPE-based RLMBs should have both the
   ability to form robust SEI films on the Li anode and strong anodic
   stability against the oxidation on the cathode.}},

Title = {{Development of a Dredging Sensitivity Index, applied to an
   industrialized coastal environment in Brazil}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{748}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Ports link world commerce via maritime routes, and dredging services are
   essential to establish and maintain these connections. However, one
   question is critical when dredging is being considered: where are the
   best places to do it? To try to answer this question, a Dredging
   Sensitivity Index (DSI) was developed as a management tool to be used in
   project planning steps. In order to diminish environmental damages and
   quality-of-life losses, DSI provides alternatives by identifying
   sensitivity areas. This new methodology quantifies impacts caused by the
   sediment removal step and points out favorable areas to dredge, with a
   simple map. Parameters such as fine-grain content (\% < 63 mu m), Acid
   Volatile Sulfides (AVS), Shannon-Wiener Index and fisheries, among
   others, were used to calculate the DSI. Formulas were used to weight and
   aggregate both, the parameters and the DSI itself. Sepetiba Bay was
   chosen to apply this methodology because of its relevant economic and
   environmental aspects. The methodology was applied to dredging
   situations, but it can be used to indicate areas for dredged material
   disposal, with a few modifications in the DSI formulas. A DSI map was a
   final result of this methodology, and showed that the northern portion
   of the bay, close to the littoral is a more sensitive area, where
   dredging should be avoided, or carried out very carefully. DSI is a very
   useful tool for reducing damages from dredging services, it contributes
   with zonation and it provides alternatives to decision-makers who manage
   these areas. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Microwave generation and modulation over the V- and W-bands are
   investigated using a semiconductor laser subject to both comb-like
   optical injection and direct modulation. The former not only excites
   period-one (P1) nonlinear dynamics for tunable microwave generation but
   also improves the stability and purity of such generated microwaves. The
   latter upconverts data onto the generated microwaves by superimposing
   the data effectively only onto the lower oscillation sideband of the P1
   dynamics, which prevents the data from dispersion-induced degradation
   over fiber distribution. As a result, microwaves that are continuously
   tunable from 40 to 110 GHz with a 3-dB linewidth of less than 1 Hz and
   with phase noise better than -95 dBc/Hz at 10-kHz offset are generated.
   A bit-error ratio better than the forward error correction limit, 3.8 x
   10(-3), is achieved for 12-Gb/s 16-quadrature amplitude modulation data
   after 25-km fiber distribution. (C) 2020 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Background Hearing loss (HL) is a significant public health concern
   globally and is estimated to affect over nine million people in England.
   The aim of this research was to explore the regional patterns and trends
   of HL in a representative longitudinal prospective cohort study of the
   English population aged 50 and over. Methods We used the full dataset
   (74,699 person-years) of self-reported hearing data from all eight Waves
   of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) (2002-2017). We
   examined the geographical identifiers of the participants at the
   Government Office Region (GOR) level and the geographically based Index
   of Multiple Deprivation (IMD). The primary outcome measure was
   self-reported HL; it consisted of a merged category of people who rated
   their hearing as fair or poor on a five-point Likert scale (excellent,
   very good, good, fair or poor) or responded positively when asked
   whether they find it difficult to follow a conversation if there is
   background noise (e.g. noise from a TV, a radio or children playing).
   Results A marked elevation in HL prevalence (10.2\%) independent of the
   age of the participants was observed in England in 2002-2017. The mean
   HL prevalence increased from 38.50 (95\%CI 37.37-39.14) in Wave 1 to
   48.66 (95\%CI 47.11-49.54) in Wave 8. We identified three critical
   patterns of findings concerning regional trends: the highest HL
   prevalence among samples with equal means of age was observed in GORs
   with the highest prevalence of participants in the most deprived (IMD)
   quintile, in routine or manual occupations and misusing alcohol. The
   adjusted HL predictions at the means (APMs) showed marked regional
   variability and hearing health inequalities between Northern and
   Southern England that were previously unknown. Conclusions A
   sociospatial approach is crucial for planning sustainable models of
   hearing care based on actual needs and reducing hearing health
   inequalities. The Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) currently
   responsible for the NHS audiology services in England should not
   consider HL an inevitable accompaniment of older age; instead, they
   should incorporate socio-economic factors and modifiable lifestyle
   behaviours for HL within their spatial patterning in England.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Demographic and epidemiological challenges are demanding
   deep transformation within health systems. The Basque Health System has
   introduced innovative initiatives to deal with this reality,
   particularly focused on patients with multiple chronic conditions. This
   review intends to identify and summarize the existing evidence on the
   effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these innovations developed in
   the Basque Country focused on complex chronic, frail, and end-of-life
   patients.
   Methods: A scoping review of literature was undertaken in PubMed
   database and gray literature for data published from 2009 to 2016 on
   clinical management innovative approaches related to complex chronic,
   frail, and end-of-life patients in the Basque Country. Selected papers
   were analyzed by study population, reported outcomes, study period, and
   setting.
   Results: 12 studies corresponding to 9 initiatives have been included
   and analyzed in the review. Results show that interventions had been
   effective in the achievement of their objectives and therefore, care for

Abstract = {{Regularities of formation of thin foils (up to 100 mu m) of high-entropy
   alloys (HEAs) of Cr-Fe-Co-Ni-Cu system at electron beam physical vapor
   deposition (EB-PVD) were studied in the work. Thin foils of CrFeCoNiCu
   alloy were produced using a single-crucible evaporation with a constant
   rate of feeding of the alloy into the liquid pool. The influence of
   deposition temperature on the structure of the produced foils is
   considered. X-ray methods were used to study the phase composition and
   the texture of CrFeCoNiCu foils. Foils deposited at temperature below
   923 K exhibit a single-FCC structure and low degree of texture. It is
   shown that increase in deposition temperature to 973 K leads to the
   transition from the foil microstructure containing almost randomly
   oriented nanosized crystallites separated by voided boundaries to
   columnar-like grains microstructure exhibiting a two-component axial <
   111 > + < 100 > texture. Moreover, the increase of deposition
   temperature to 1023 K results in the transition into dual-FCC phase
   state. Effect of the structure change on mechanical properties of the
   deposited foils was analyzed.}},

Journal = {{DERMATOLOGIC THERAPY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{34}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets CD20, a B-lymphocyte
   antigen; that leads to a decline in the B-cell counts for at least a
   year. The patients who have received rituximab treatment in the previous
   5 years with the diagnosis of pemphigus group of diseases at Cerrahpasa
   Medical Faculty were questioned for COVID-19 infection. A total of 48
   patients were included in this study; only one male patient had COVID-19
   infection which had a mild course. There is no significant difference in
   the total number of lymphocytes between patients who have received
   rituximab within the previous 5 years or last year. The number of
   lymphocytes is independent of the number of courses of rituximab
   treatment received. Therefore, we suggest that all pemphigus patients
   who have received rituximab treatment within the previous 5 years should
   be careful of the preventive measures against the COVID-19 infection
   irrespective of the number of treatment courses or the number of years
   which has passed since the treatment. The disease course was mild in the
   only infected patient. Thus, rituximab may be used in the treatment of
   pemphigus vulgaris during the COVID-19 pandemic if its use is necessary.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the formation mechanism of the plate-like ZrB2 particle
   via the molten salt synthesis method is investigated. The partial
   reactions and sequence of reactions were studied using
   thermo-gravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA) on the
   mixture of starting materials containing Al, KBF4, and K2ZrF6. In order
   to understand the reactions which take place during the synthesis
   process, the mixture was heat-treated at the critical temperatures
   obtained from TG/DTA analysis. The attained products were characterized
   by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and
   high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Results
   indicated that the formation of AlB2, AlB12, and Al3Zr takes place at a
   temperature less than 500 degrees C. Moreover, during the reaction, the
   formation of KAlF4 besides these products was confirmed by XRD and DTA
   analyses. The KAlF4 completely melted at the temperature of 575 degrees
   C. These particles dissolved in the molten KAlF4 above its melting
   point, and the reaction between them leads to the formation of the ZrB2
   particles. Differences between ZrB2 and intermediate products morphology
   proposed that the dominant mechanism for ZrB2 formation is
   solution-precipitation. The role of aluminum is the reduction of
   starting material at the primary stages and the formation of low melting
   point salt mixtures. The proposed mechanism of ZrB2 formation was also
   discussed by the thermodynamics calculation.}},

Abstract = {{The study aimed at developing a functional food by osmotic infusion of
   probiotic bacteria in pineapple matrix. Significant (p{*} < .05)
   incorporation of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) (8.54 +/-
   0.04 log CFU/g) and Lacticaseibacillus casei (L. casei) (8.55 +/- 0.05
   log CFU/g) in probiotic infused cut pineapple piece was observed after 4
   hr of dehydration in sucrose-based (50 degrees Brix) osmotic solution.
   SEM results corroborated successful infusion of probiotic cells at both
   surface and sub-surface levels. Osmotically dehydrated pineapple pieces
   showed a marginal decrease in brightness, yellowness, increased
   firmness, and insignificant changes in pH and a(w). Under simulated
   gastric stress, infused L. plantarum and L. casei exhibited good
   survival of up to 8.7 +/- 0.04 log CFU/g. Under simulated intestinal
   stress, both L. plantarum and L. casei recorded reduction of
   approximately 1 log CFU/g (7.8 +/- 0.07 log CFU/g). The Infused L.
   plantarum and L. casei showed viability >6 log CFU/g till 10 days at -20
   degrees C.
   Practical applications Increased awareness among consumers toward the
   intricate relationship between diet and disease has rekindled interest
   in functional foods containing probiotics, especially the non-dairy
   segment. The sale of functional food snacks is projected to reach \$8.5
   billion by 2020. India is among the largest producers of pineapple,
   which occupies an important niche in the cut fruit market. Development
   of cut pineapple as a probiotic carrier using energy saving procedure
   like osmotic dehydration will help expand its reach in the functional
   food market. The growth and survival of probiotic bacteria in functional
   food products under gastro-intestinal stress conditions is the key to
   deliver the desired health benefits. Our results indicate not only
   efficient osmotic infusion of L. plantarum and L. casei in the cut
   pineapple matrix but also good survival under simulated gastrointestinal
   stress and storage conditions. Our studies showed cut pineapple infused
   with probiotics by osmotic dehydration can be a suitable non-dairy
   probiotic food.}},

Title = {{Application of the reciprocity theorem to scattering of surface waves by
   an inclined subsurface crack}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{207}},
Pages = {{82-88}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{In this paper the scattering of incident surface waves by an inclined
   subsurface crack in a homogenous, isotropic and linearly elastic
   half-space has been investigated in a two-dimensional plane strain
   configuration. The elastodynamic reciprocity theorem together with a
   virtual wave has been used to determine the amplitude of the scattered
   surface waves in the far field. It is found that the amplitude is in
   terms of the crack opening volume due to the incident surface waves. A
   special case of low frequency, for which the wavelength of the surface
   wave is sufficiently larger than the crack length, has been considered
   to illustrate the method. A specific expression of the amplitude has
   been obtained, which provides information on the angle, length and depth
   of the crack. It shows that the amplitude of the scattered surface wave
   increases first and then decreases as the crack angle changes from 0
   degrees to 90 degrees. For the case of an inclined crack, the results of
   the numerical analysis together with the analytical solutions show
   excellent agreement when the crack length is much smaller than the
   wavelength. The results in this paper should be useful for the
   quantitative measurement of subsurface cracks. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Multiphase flow characteristics and EOR mechanism of immiscible CO2
   water-alternating-gas injection after continuous CO2 injection: A
   micro-scale visual investigation}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{282}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Water-alternating-gas (WAG) injection has been widely applied in fossil
   fuel reservoirs to enhance oil recovery (EOR) and CO2 capture and
   storage (CCS) efficiency. However, no systematic investigation on the
   multiphase flow characteristics and EOR mechanism of WAG injection after
   continuous CO2 injection has been conducted at the micro-scale.
   Therefore, a visual micromodel was developed using CT scanning and
   microelectronic photolithography. Subsequently, micro-scale visual
   experiments were conducted to simulate the water injection, CO2
   injection and WAG injection processes. Then, the multiphase flow
   characteristics and residual oil trapping mechanism were observed and
   analyzed. Finally, the volumetric sweep efficiency (VSE), oil
   displacement efficiency (ODE), residual oil distribution, and
   improvement effects of WAG-EOR and WAG-CCS were quantitatively studied.
   Experimental results revealed the flow characteristics of oil-water,
   oil-gas, and oil-gas-water were different. Pore throat morphology,
   wettability, and injection parameters all affects the multiphase flow
   process. Six types of residual oil were trapped and observed at various
   locations. The multiphase flow characteristics of jumping displacement,
   multiple displacement, and compression-release were identified. The VSE
   of water injection, gas injection, and WAG injection were 68.0\%,
   53.5\%, and 86.0\%, respectively. WAG injection significantly reduced
   ``cluster-shaped{''} and ``island-shaped{''} residual oil and oil
   film/ring. Therefore, the WAG-EOR mechanism is a combination of the
   macroscopic VSE of water injection and the microscopic ODE of CO2
   injection. WAG injection after continuous CO2 injection increased oil
   recovery by 23.15\% and CCS by 0.174 PV. However, the improvement
   effects of EOR and CCS capacity were dominated by the first and second
   WAG injection cycles, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{This study was designed to investigate the prognostic value of the
   number and sites of extracranial metastasis (ECM) in NSCLC patients with
   BM. NSCLC patients with BM from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
   Results (SEER) database from 2010 to 2015 were enrolled in analysis.
   Patients from 2010 to 2013 were included in the training set and those
   from 2014 to 2015 in the validation set. ECM sites among different
   subtypes of NSCLC were compared by Chi-square tests. Kaplan-Meier
   methods and Cox regression models were performed to analyze survival
   data. Competing-risks analysis was used to predict cumulative incidence
   rates for CSS and non-CSS cause. We included 5974 patients in the
   training cohort and 3561 patients in the validation cohort. Most (nearly
   80\%) NSCLC patients with BM showed 0-1 involved extracranial organ,
   with the most and least common ECM organ being bone and distant lymph
   nodes (DLNs) among all subtypes of NSCLC, respectively. The number of
   involved extracranial organs was an independent prognostic factor for
   patients with BM from NSCLC (p < 0.001). Patients with 0-1 ECM had
   better survival than those with larger number of involved extracranial
   organs (p < 0.001). Cumulative incidence rates for CSS were increased
   with the number of ECM raising (p < 0.001). All involved extracranial
   organs were associated with worse survival (p < 0.05). In patients with
   single-organ ECM, we observed a better prognosis in lung and bone
   metastasis, while liver metastasis showed worst survival. But the
   difference in survival in these patient groups was relatively small.
   Patients with liver metastasis had higher cumulative incidence rates for
   CSS than that in patients with lung and bone metastasis (p < 0.05). More
   extracranial metastases were associated with poor prognosis in NSCLC
   patients with BM and ECM sites showed limited effect on survival.
   Tailored treatments would be reasonable for BM patients from NSCLC with
   different metastasis patterns.}},

Abstract = {{The delta-MnO2 nanowires are fabricated and chemically bonded with the
   carbon black that has appropriate amounts of oxygen containing

   limiting-current density (5.47 mA cm(2)) of the hybrid in alkaline
   medium are close to those of 20 wt\% Pt/C, respectively. The hybrid is
   used as cathodic catalyst in a Zn-air battery cell, which displays a
   peak power density of 138.0 mW cm(2), comparable to that using Pt/C
   catalyst (142.8 mW cm(-2)). This excellent catalytic performance is
   attributed to the unique microstructure of the hybrid that accelerates
   the kinetics of ORR. Furthermore, the ORR catalytic mechanism is also
   systematically analysed based on the microstructural characterization
   and electrochemical response. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The newly developed Zr-1Nb-0.01Cu fuel cladding tubes were
   hydrogen-charged using the electrolytic technique and cooled down to
   room temperature after thermal treatment by furnace cooling (FC) and air
   cooling (AC). High energy X-ray diffraction and electron backscatter
   diffraction techniques were employed to measure the microscopic stress
   and crystallographic orientation of hydrides precipitated in FC and AC
   tube samples. The FC delta-hydrides precipitated in the Zr-1Nb-0.01Cu
   cladding tube were under an average compressive stress of about (-262.2
   +/- 20) MPa. While an average compressive stress of about (-152.4 +/-
   20) MPa was determined for the AC delta-hydrides precipitated in the
   Zr-1Nb-0.01Cu cladding tube. Nearly all the inter- and intra-granular
   d-hydrides obtained during FC and AC followed the conventional
   (0001)(alpha-Zr) parallel to (111)(delta-hydride) orientation
   relationship (OR) with the alpha-Zr matrix. The unusual (0001)(alpha-Zr)
   parallel to (100)(delta-hydride) OR was only occasionally detected in

   sample, delta-hydrides were simultaneously detected in an alpha-Zr
   grain, obeying (0001)(alpha-Zr) parallel to (111)(delta-hydride) OR and
   (0001)(alpha-Zr) parallel to (100)(delta-hydride) OR with the same

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{13}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Gaining environmental awareness through lateral head scanning (yaw
   rotations) is important for driving safety, especially when approaching
   intersections. Therefore, head scanning movements could be an important
   behavioral metric for driving safety research and driving risk
   mitigation systems. Tracking head scanning movements with a single
   in-car camera is preferred hardware-wise, but it is very challenging to
   track the head over almost a 180 degrees range. In this paper, we
   investigate two state-of-the-art methods, a multi-loss deep residual
   learning method with 50 layers (multi-loss ResNet-50) and an ORB
   feature-based simultaneous localization and mapping method (ORB-SLAM).
   While deep learning methods have been extensively studied for head pose
   detection, this is the first study in which SLAM has been employed to
   innovatively track head scanning over a very wide range. Our laboratory
   experimental results showed that ORB-SLAM was more accurate than
   multi-loss ResNet-50, which often failed when many facial features were
   not in the view. On the contrary, ORB-SLAM was able to continue tracking
   as it does not rely on particular facial features. Testing with real
   driving videos demonstrated the feasibility of using ORB-SLAM for
   tracking large lateral head scans in naturalistic video data.}},

Title = {{A new method of diesel fuel brands identification: SMOTE oversampling

Journal = {{FUEL}},

Volume = {{282}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Using proper diesel brand is the key to ensure the normal operation of
   diesel engine. It is even more important to identify the brands of
   diesel oil effectively. This paper presented a new model of near
   infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) identification of diesel oil brands that
   combined Tree-based feature selection, Synthetic Minority Oversampling
   Technique (SMOTE) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ensemble
   learning in order to achieve the goal of high accuracy and rapidity. To
   further demonstrate the practical effect of the proposed ensemble
   method, it was compared with a single decision tree (DT) classifier
   based on classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm. As a
   result, the recognition rate of Tree-SMOTE-XGBoost model proposed in
   this paper was 19.33\% higher than that of XGBoost model, and 9.25\%
   higher than that of Tree-SMOTE-DT model. More importantly, it can ensure
   the accuracy of each class under the premise of serious imbalance of
   classes. The proposed method saves manpower and material resources, and
   provides a new alternative approach for diesel brands identification.}},

Abstract = {{A layered QAM constellation generation method is proposed and it is
   applied to the SIM-OFDM system. In this method, the bit sequence is
   grouped layer by layer according to the specific bit and mapped to the
   corresponding constellation points. In this paper, the 24QAM-SIM-OFDM,
   48QAM-SIM-OFDM, 80QAM-SIM-OFDM and 120QAM-SIM-OFDM constellations are
   generated by this method, and their performance is analyzed. The result
   shows that the BER of 80QAM-SIM-OFDM is lower than that of
   64QAM-SIM-OFDM when SNR is low. And when BER is 3.8 x 10(-3), the SNR
   requirement of layered 80QAM-SIM-OFDM signal is about 0.12 dB lower than
   that of 64QAM-SIM-OFDM, and the SNR requirement of layered
   120QAM-SIM-OFDM signal is about 3 dB lower than that of 128QAM-SIM-OFDM.}},

Title = {{Effect of different drying methods on the quality and microstructure of
   fresh jujube crisp slices}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FOOD PROCESSING AND PRESERVATION}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This study investigated the effects of different drying methods,
   including hot-air drying (HD), freeze drying (FD), and
   pressure-differential puffing drying (PPD), on the quality and
   microstructure of fresh jujube crisp slices. Our data confirmed that PPD
   has the best effect, followed by FD and HD. Crisps dried using FD had
   good color and the best rehydration rate, shrinkage volume rate, and
   apparent density. The color, rehydration, and hardness of fragile chips
   by PPD and FD were similar; jujube slice volume shrinkage and density
   increase were due to water evaporation during drying. The
   bioavailability and microstructure of PPD was the best. Polysaccharide
   and total phenol bioavailability was the highest in PPD samples and
   remained stable, with clear porous structure and a smaller folding
   structure, indicating that PPD maintains the porous cell structure.
   Thus, PPD provides high quality fresh jujube crisp slice products due to
   uniform honeycomb network and less collapsed structure.
   Practical applications Jujube is a fruit grown in China. This study
   provides technical information and theoretical basis for the production
   of puffed dry food, which is widely used in food production. First, the
   crisps obtained can be directly graded, packaged, sold, and transformed
   into green snack food; these techniques can be applied to other fruits,
   such as cantaloupe, apricot, and carrot. Second, dried fruits and
   vegetables were directly processed into ultra-micro nutrient powder,
   which retains its flavor to a large extent. Furthermore, the dried
   powder may be used as auxiliary materials or seasoning in the processing
   of other foods to improve the color and flavor of the product.
   Processing fresh jujube into crisps can widen its industrial
   applications and add value to its products.}},

Abstract = {{Main observation and conclusion
   Sarcaglarols A-D (1-4), two pairs of lindenane-monoterpene heterodimers
   fused by a 1,2-dioxane moiety, were discovered and isolated from the

   of HRESIMS, NMR spectroscopic data, ECD spectrum, and the X-ray
   diffraction study of isopropylidene derivatives. An intermolecular
   {[}2+2+2] cycloaddition may play a key role in the biosynthesis pathway
   of the 1,2-dioxane moiety fused lindenane-monoterpene heterodimer
   skeleton, which can be recognized as the biogenetic precursors of our

Abstract = {{Viruses have evolved multiple strategies to evade elimination by the
   immune system. Here we examined the contribution of host long noncoding
   RNAs (lncRNAs) in viral immune evasion. By functional screening of
   lncRNAs whose expression decreased upon viral infection of macrophages,
   we identified a lncRNA (lncRNA-GM, Gene Symbol: AK189470.1) that
   promoted type 1 interferon (IFN-I) production and inhibited viral
   replication. Deficiency of lncRNA-GM in mice increased susceptibility to
   viral infection and impaired IFN-1 production. Mechanistically,
   lncRNA-GM bound to glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) and blocked
   GSTM1 interaction with the kinase TBK1, reducing GSTM1-mediated
   S-glutathionylation of TBK1. Decreased S-glutathionylation enhanced TBK1
   activity and downstream production of antiviral mediators, Viral
   infection reprogrammed intracellular glutathione metabolism and
   furthermore, an oxidized glutathione mimetic could inhibit TBK1 activity
   and promote viral replication. Our findings reveal regulation of TBK1 by
   S-glutathionylation and provide insight into the viral mediated
   metabolic changes that impact innate immunity and viral evasion.}},

Journal = {{OCEAN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{218}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Subsea pipelines with a free suspended span segment may be subject to
   upheaval buckling under high temperature, which may lead to a failure
   mode such as local buckling, fracture and fatigue. Mathematical models
   are established to study the upheaval buckling behaviour of subsea
   pipelines with a free span segment. Then, the accurate locations of the
   maxima of displacement and stress are obtained. The buckled
   configuration and the typical post-buckling behaviour and their
   dependence on free span length are analysed. Furthermore, a detailed
   analysis is presented for critical temperature difference, displacement
   amplitude and maximum axial compressive stress. Finally, the influence
   of touchdown on post-buckling behaviour during the process of upheaval
   buckling is discussed. The results show that the pipeline is prone to
   upheaval buckling when the free span length is large enough and the
   critical temperature difference decreases with increasing free span
   length. The displacement amplitude and the maximum stress within the
   span increase with the increase of the free span length before
   touchdown. However, after the pipeline touches the bottom of the free
   span, the maximum stress within the span decreases significantly
   compared to the case without touchdown, which becomes further smaller
   for smaller depth of the free span.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Whether bacterial vaginosis (BV) and CD101
   immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) variants independently increase HIV risk
   through mucosal inflammation is not well understood. We evaluated
   whether the impact of BV on HIV acquisition in women differs by the
   presence or absence of candidate CD101 Ig-like variants.
   Methods: We used data from 2 studies of HIV serodiscordant couples in
   east (Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda) and southern (Botswana, South Africa,
   and Zambia) Africa, which longitudinally assessed HIV acquisition (by
   ELISA) and BV (by Nugent score >= 7). We used previously generated CD101
   sequence data for each case and control participant to create a binary
   variable indicating the presence/absence of any of 5 CD101 Ig-like
   variants.
   Results: Confirming previously shown results in this cohort, Ig-like
   variants increased HIV-infection risk (adjusted hazard ratio {[}aHR], =
   2.63; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 1.41 to 4.89). BV was associated
   with 2.5-fold higher HIV-infection risk only in the absence of Ig-like
   variants (aHR = 2.47; 95\% CI, 0.99 to 6.15; P = 0.052), whereas in the
   presence of Ig-like variants, BV was not associated with higher
   HIV-infection risk (aHR = 0.87; 95\% CI, 0.35 to 2.15; P = 0.765);
   however, a test for interaction was nonsignificant (P = 0.116).
   Conclusions: We hypothesized that both BV and CD101 Ig-like variants
   facilitate HIV acquisition by augmenting similar genital inflammation
   pathways. Our findings indicate that inflammatory mucosal effects of
   Ig-like variants may influence the impact of BV on HIV risk.
   Host-defined inflammatory pathways may be useful targets for HIV
   prevention.}},

Title = {{Carbon sequestration and storage in Norwegian Arctic coastal wetlands:
   Impacts of climate change}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{748}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Coastal wetlands contain some of the largest stores of pedologic and
   biotic carbon pools, and climate change is likely to influence the
   ability of these ecosystems to sequester carbon. Recent studies have
   attempted to provide data on carbon sequestration in both temperate and
   tropical coastal wetlands. Alteration of Arctic wetland carbon
   sequestration rates is also likely where coastal forcing mechanisms
   interact directly with these coastal systems. At present there are no
   data available to provide a detailed understanding of present day and
   historical carbon sequestration rates within Arctic coastal wetlands.
   In order to address this knowledge gap, rates of carbon sequestration
   were assessed within five Arctic coastal wetland sites in Norway. This
   was undertaken using radiometric dating techniques (Pb-210 and Cs-132)
   to establish a geochronology for recent wetland development, and soil
   carbon stocks were estimated from cores.
   Average carbon sequestration rates were varied, both between sites and
   over time, ranging between 19 and 603 g C m(2) y(-1), and these were
   correlated with increases in the length of the growing season. Stocks
   ranged between 3.67 and 13.79 Mg C ha(-1), which is very low compared
   with global average estimations for similar coastal systems, e.g. 250 Mg
   C ha(-1) for temperate salt marshes, 280 Mg C ha(-1) for mangroves, and
   140 Mg C ha(-1) for seagrasses. This is most likely due to isostatic
   uplift and sediment accretion historically outpacing sea level rise,
   which results in wetland progradation and thus a continuous formation of
   new marsh with thin organic soil horizons. However, with increasing
   rates of sea level rise it is uncertain whether this trend is set to
   continue or be reversed. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We previously defined the HERV-K Np9 as a viral oncogene. Here we report
   the discovery of a novel oncogene, Np17, which is homologous to the
   viral Np9 gene and predominantly present in Hominoidea. Np17 is located
   on chromosome 8, consists of 7 exons, and encodes a 16.8kDa nuclear
   protein with149 amino-acid residue. Functionally, knockdown of Np17
   induced growth inhibition of leukemia cells, whereas enforced expression
   of Np17 promoted growth of leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo. In human
   leukemia, Np17 was detected in 59.65\% (34/57) of acute myeloid leukemia
   (AML) patients examined and associated with refractory/relapsed AML.
   Mechanistically, Np17 decreased p53 levels and its mechanism might be
   involved in recruiting nuclear MDM2 to p53 for ubiquitin-mediated
   degradation. These findings reveal that Np17 is a novel oncogene
   associated with refractory/relapsed leukemia.}},

Title = {{Nurturing psychological capital: an examination of organizational
   antecedents: the role of employee perceptions of teamwork, training
   opportunities and leader-member exchange}},
Journal = {{PERSONNEL REVIEW}},
Abstract = {{Purpose This paper uses conservation of resources (COR) theory to
   examine antecedents of psychological capital (PsyCap). Past research
   shows that employees with high personal resources such as PsyCap also
   have high work performance. Hence, organizations need information about
   how to enhance PsyCap. This paper extends existing research by examining
   potential antecedents of PsyCap. A total of three potential antecedents
   are tested, including perceptions of individual-level cooperation
   between employees (i.e. teamwork), relationships between employees and
   their supervisors (i.e. supervisor-subordinate relationships) and a
   human resource (HR) practice (i.e. training opportunities).
   Design/methodology/approach Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used
   to compare the impact of organizational factors on US and Australian
   employees' PsyCap. Findings The results indicate a significant direct
   effect of leader-member exchange (LMX) onto PsyCap and a significant
   indirect effect between LMX and PsyCap through teamwork and through
   training opportunities for employees in Australia and the USA. Teamwork
   and training opportunities partially mediate the impact of LMX onto
   PsyCap for both Australian and US employees. Practical implications
   Australian employees are likely to reduce their performance because of a
   perceived loss of personal resources and/or may even experience burnout
   and/or become a stress-related workers compensation statistic.
   Originality/value The findings suggest that employees in Australia
   perceived significantly lower levels of supportive resources to draw
   upon, including from their managers and peers. On applying COR theory,
   when comparing employees, it was observed that those who perceive fewer
   resources will be less equipped to produce resource gains. Taking into
   consideration that employees require the use of resources to maintain
   personal resources, Australian employees have fewer resources at their
   disposal to maintain their personal resources (i.e. PsyCap).}},

Title = {{Development of a topographic-corrected temperature and greenness model
   (TG) for improving GPP estimation over mountainous areas}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{295}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The temperature and greenness model (TG) demonstrates that the
   combination of enhanced vegetation index and Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) is feasible in
   obtaining gross primary productivity (GPP) at the landscape, regional,
   and global scales. However, the input LST data of TG is always available
   at a coarse resolution (similar to 1 km), averaging a relatively large
   portion of the topographic characteristics. Hence, GPP simulated using
   the coarse spatial resolution LST data would suffer from unavoidable
   bias over mountainous areas. Considering the above limitation, this work
   proposed a mountainous temperature and greenness model (MTG) through
   integrating an elevation-corrected factor and a radiation-corrected
   factor with the current TG model. The proposed MTG model was validated
   at sixteen eddy covariance (EC) sites with apparent topography in the
   carbon footprint areas. Results showed that MTG-simulated GPP presented
   a better agreement with EC GPP than TG-simulated GPP, characterized by
   an increase of 0.06 in R-2 and a decrease of 5.43 gC m(-2) 8d(-1) in
   root mean square error, suggesting that the MTG model had a better
   feasibility of capturing the GPP variations over mountainous areas than
   the TG model. The standard deviation of MTG-simulated GPP at the sixteen
   study sites varied between 3.29 and 22.79 gC m(-2) 8d(-1), highlighting
   the importance of considering topography within coarse pixels when
   obtaining GPP estimates over mountainous areas. Furthermore, results
   also indicated that the MTG-simulated GPP showed obvious responses to
   topography, suggesting that the MTG model could adequately characterize
   the topographic effects on plant photosynthesis. More specifically,
   MTG-simulated GPP increased when slope increased in the sunlit terrains,
   while it was found to have a lower value when slope increased in the
   shaded terrains. Our study suggests that incorporating topography
   information into current GPP models is a practical approach to improve
   GPP estimates over mountainous areas.}},

Abstract = {{Background Information on incidence of gastrointestinal stromal tumor
   (GIST), the most common type of mesenchymal tumor in gastrointestinal
   tract, was limited in China. This study aimed to estimate the incidence
   of GIST in urban population from mainland China in 2016.
   Methods Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) and Urban
   Residence Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI) in China were used. The
   denominator of incidence was the total person-years of insured
   individuals in 2016 in the database, covering approximately 0.43 billion
   individuals. The numerator was the number of incident GIST cases in
   2016.
   Results The crude incidence in 2016 was 0.40 per 100,000 person-years
   (95\% CI, 0.06-1.03). Male incidence was higher than female incidence
   (0.44 vs. 0.36, rate ratio: 1.22, p < 0.001). The mean age at diagnosis
   was 55.20 years (SD = 14.26) and the incidence among those aged 50 years
   or older was 2.63 times (0.84 vs. 0.32, p < 0.001) higher than those
   aged under 50. The highest incidence was observed in East China (2.29,
   95\% CI: 0.46-5.54).
   Conclusions The incidence of GIST in mainland China was lower than
   Europe, North America and Korea. The mean age at diagnosis of GIST in
   China was younger than that of Europe and Canada. This study provides
   useful information to further research, policy formulating and
   management of GIST.}},

Abstract = {{Electroholography can produce natural 3D scenes and has gained
   recognition as an ideal 3D technology. However, insufficient
   computational power has made it difficult to achieve real-time
   electroholography. In this paper, we developed a compact special-purpose
   system for calculating phase-only holograms. We implemented the
   developed system using a system on a chip embedded with a processor and
   logic circuit blocks. Our system successfully computed holograms of
   1,920x1,080 pixels from a point-cloud with 32,500 points at 10 frames
   per second. The system is 147 times faster than a personal computer
   (with 6 CPU cores). (C) 2020 Optical Society of America under the terms

Title = {{Source of the Zhawulong granitic pegmatite-type lithium deposit in the

Journal = {{LITHOS}},

Abstract = {{The Zhawulong ore field hosts lots of rare-element pegmatite dikes and
   is an important producing area for lithium resources in the
   Songpan-Ganze orogenic belt (SGOB), east Tibet. This paper aims to
   evaluate the sources and ore-forming processes for granite and pegmatite
   in the Zhawulong ore field, as well as the petrogenetic links between
   these rocks, using petrography, whole-rock major and trace-element
   analysis, and Sr-Nd-Hf isotope analysis. In this ore field, pegmatites
   are common as dike swarms that emanate from the external and/or internal
   contact zone of the Zhawulong granitic pluton and strata of the Triassic
   Xikang group, showing close spatial relationships. Measured values of
   K/Rb vs. Zr, Hf, and Cs contents indicate geochemical affinities between
   granite and pegmatite, which suggests that the pegmatite was generated
   by processes involving high fractional crystallization from the residual
   parental magma of the host granite. Additionally, the granite have high
   (Sr-87/Sr-86) i values (0.711064 to 0.716105), negative epsilon(Nd)(t)
   values (-9.6 to-9.1) and epsilon(Hf)(t) values (-32.6 to-2.0), and
   ancient Nd and Hf model ages (1.2-3.1 Ga), which indicate a continental
   crustal source. Metasedimentary rocks of the Xikang group are rich in Li
   (similar to 95 ppm), Rb (similar to 124 ppm), Nb (similar to 15 ppm),
   and Cs (similar to 17 ppm), and their rare-earth element (REE) patterns
   show moderate enrichment in light REEs and a negative Eu anomaly
   (Eu/Eu{*} = similar to 0.64), revealing characteristics similar to those
   of granite. The coeval nature and close spatial relationships between
   the Zhawulong granite and other syn-orogenic S-type granites indicate
   that the formation of this granitewas related to crustal melting. The
   petrology and geochemical signatures of the Zhawulong rare-metal-bearing
   granitepegmatite imply that it was generated by the partial melting of
   metasedimentary rocks during the Late Triassic orogeny assembly and was
   further enriched in Li through processes involving high fractional
   crystallization. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The size effect on the thermal expansion of ZrO2/ZrW2O8 fabricated by
   the conventional thermal sintering process is investigated
   systematically. The small-sized sample with dense microstructure and few
   ZrW2O8 decomposition exhibits near-zero thermal expansion. While the
   microstructure and thermal expansion property of the large-sized sample
   deteriorates due to the serious decomposition of ZrW2O8. The finite
   element analysis is used to investigate the thermal transfer during the
   quenching, demonstrating that the smaller specific surface area (SSA) of
   the large-sized sample is the direct reason of the size effect, and the
   core causes are the instability of ZrW2O8 and the low thermal
   conductivity of the ZrO2/ZrW2O8. A thermal conducive pathway is further
   designed for the large-sized sample to verify and attenuate the size
   effect by increasing the SSA. The technique of ultra-low sintering
   temperature is urgently recommended to effectively solve the obstruction
   caused by the size effect.}},

Title = {{The influence of thixotropy on the magnetorheological property of
   oil-based ferrofluid}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{320}},
Number = {{A}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{A Fe3O4 hydrocarbon oil-based ferrofluid was synthesized and its
   magnetorheological behavior was investigated. The ferrofluid exhibits
   shear thinning behavior under different magnetic fields and a
   significant hysteresis effect was observed from the viscosity-shear rate
   flow curves due to the thixotropy of ferrofluid. The thixotropic
   behavior is induced by the presence and evolution of the microstructures
   in the ferrofluid. Moreover, the experimental results demonstrate that
   the viscosity of the ferrofluid decreases with increasing magnetic field
   when the magnetic field is below 81 mT. This is followed by an abrupt
   increase in the viscosity when the magnetic field increases to 124 mT.
   However, the viscosity again decreases as the magnetic field continue to
   increase beyond 124 mT. We reveal the negative correlations between
   viscosity and magnetic fields. The unusual magnetorheological behavior
   of the ferrofluid is due to the joint effect of thixotropy and magnetic
   fields. These findings provide a new perspective on the theological
   behaviors of ferrofluids that takes the thixotropic effect into
   consideration. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although circular RNAs (circRNAs) are known to play key roles in
   non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, much about their targets and
   mechanisms remains unknown. We therefore investigated the actions and
   mechanisms of hsa\_circ\_0048179 in an in vitro model of NAFLD. HepG2
   cells were exposed to oleate/palmitate (2:1 ratio) for 24 h to induce
   intracellular lipid accumulation. Using CCK-8 assays, flow cytometry,
   fluorescence microscopy, western blotting, RT-qPCR, and Oil red O
   staining, we found that oleate/palmitate treatment reduced cell
   viability while increasing apoptosis and lipid accumulation in HepG2
   cells. Levels of the antioxidant enzyme GPX4 were decreased in
   oleate/palmitate-treated HepG2 cells, and there were corresponding
   increases in reactive oxygen species and damage to mitochondrial
   cristae. Levels of hsa\_circ\_0048179 expression were also suppressed by
   oleate/palmitate treatment, and GPX4 levels were markedly increased in
   HepG2 cells following transfection with hsa\_circ\_0048179. Analysis of
   its mechanism revealed that hsa\_circ\_0048179 upregulated GPX4 levels
   by acting as a competitive ``sponge{''} of miR-188-3p and that
   hsa\_circ\_0048179 attenuated oleate/palmitate-induced lipid
   accumulation in HepG2 cells by sponging miR-188-3p. Collectively, our
   findings suggest that hsa\_circ\_0048179 may play a key role in the
   pathogenesis of steatosis and may thus be a useful target for drug

Journal = {{MEASUREMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{166}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Polygonal wear is a common type of wheel surface damage in rail
   vehicles. Drastic wheel/rail interactions can be induced by wheel
   polygonization, which directly influences train service performance and
   maintenance cost, even threatens running safety of rail vehicles. This
   paper presents an experimental investigation into the fundamental
   feature of wheel polygonal wear through extensive field measurements. A
   series of wheel wear measurements and locomotive vibration tests were
   conducted to reveal the relationship between the wheel polygonization
   and vibration alarm phenomenon occurred in heavy-haul electric
   locomotives. A post-processing method to deal with the raw data of wheel
   polygonization was applied. The characteristics of the wheel
   polygonization of the locomotives with and without abnormal vibration
   were compared and analyzed in detail. It is found that the high-order
   wheel polygonal wear is the root cause of the vibration alarm of
   locomotive unsprung components. To investigate the elimination effect of
   locomotive wheel polygonization by different wheel re-profiling methods,
   tracking measurements of wheel polygonal wear were conducted on three
   selected locomotives during an interval of the neighboring wheel
   re-profiling period. The results show that the wheel re-profiling method
   has a significant effect on the elimination and development of wheel
   polygonization. The high-order wheel polygonal wear of the re-profiled
   wheels develops slowly only if it is cleared off. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The Mississippian was an important interval for metazoan reef recovery
   after the collapse of stromatoporoid-coral reef ecosystems during the
   Late Devonian mass extinctions. Based on field observation and
   quantitative studies of biotic composition in thin sections, four
   different reef types were identified in the upper Visean strata in the
   Gandongzi section of Guangxi Province, South China. These are coral
   reef, coral-microbial-micro-problematica-bryozoan reef,
   coral-microbial-bryozoan reef, and microbial-bryozoan-coral reef. Their
   positive topographic relief from one metre to ten metres is either
   directly observed in the section or by correlation to the coeval
   non-reef facies in the adjacent Longfeng section. These reefs are
   constructed primarily of different proportion of colonial rugose corals
   (Diphyphyllum and Siphonodendron), tabulate corals (Multithecopora and
   Syringopora), cystoporate bryozoans (Fistulipora), and calcimicrobes
   (e.g., Garwoodia and Renalcis). Reef dwellers are rich and diversified
   including crinoids, brachiopods, bryozoans, gastropods, heterocorals,
   calcispheres, green algae, foraminifers, and ostracods. Their
   composition and abundance vary among the different reef types. Facies
   analysis reveals a variable composition, including framestone and
   bindstone in reef facies, and rudstone, grainstone, packstone, dolomitic
   crinoidal packstone and dolostone in the strata intercalated with reefs.
   The microbial reef facies is characterized by abundant spar-filled
   cavities, which can be classified as stromatactis and fenestral fabrics.
   In the non-reef facies, geopetal structures are abundant. Relative
   sea-level changes controlled the growth and demise of the Gandongzi
   reefs. They commonly grew during relative sea-level rise and died during
   relative sea-level fall, as evident from increasing and decreasing
   abundance of micrite, and decreasing and increasing abundance of
   cortoids, green algae and sparry calcite in reefs and their overlying
   strata, respectively. However, the final demise of the Gandongzi reef
   succession was triggered by a dramatic relative sea-level rise,
   indicated by increased micrite abundance associated with articulated and
   convex-down brachiopod shells overlying the uppermost reef. The
   Gandongzi reefs resemble coeval similar reef types on other
   palaeo-continents, in terms of reef-builder composition and internal
   structures. The important role of corals in the framework building of
   the Gandongzi reefs coincided with the late Visean coral reef
   proliferation, which is a major phase for re-establishment of metazoan
   reef ecosystems after the end-Devonian mass extinction.}},

Title = {{Effect of a skirted mudmat foundation on local scour around a submerged
   structure}},
Journal = {{OCEAN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{218}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, local scour around a subsea structure supported by a
   skirted mudmat foundation is explored experimentally. For simplicity the
   structure is represented as a submerged circular cylinder founded on a
   concentric circular mudmat. The experiments are conducted in the
   clear-water regime and various geometries are considered by varying the
   height of the submerged cylinder relative to its diameter h(1)/D-1, and
   the diameter of the mudmat relative to the submerged cylinder D-2/D-1.
   The experimental results indicate that the scour process can be
   categorized into two modes depending on geometry: Mode 1, in which local
   scour develops immediately at the upstream side of the mudmat; and Mode
   2, in which local scour initiates at the downstream side of the mudmat
   and propagates upstream. For each mode, the rate of scour reduces as the
   mudmat becomes relatively large (i.e. as D-2/D-1 increases). This
   reduction is most significant if the mudmat size is sufficient to swap
   the mode of scour from Mode 1 to Mode 2. The reduction in scour rate,
   however, does not coincide with a reduction in maximum scour depth.
   Instead, the relative scour depth of the superstructure S/D-1 increases
   as the mudmat becomes larger (i.e. as D-2/D-1 increases). This trend is
   quantitatively explained by considering the effective aspect ratio of
   the combined mudmat and superstructure. Collectively, the results of the
   present study provide insight into the inherent scour protection
   provided by a skirted mudmat foundation.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objectives: Synchronous malignant tumors of the uterine
   body and the cervix are extremely rare. The stage of both malignancies
   at diagnosis has prognostic significance and there are only occasional
   reports in the literature. Materials and Methods: We performed a
   retrospective study of all cases, where surgery for synchronous primary
   cervical and endometrial cancers was done at the Clinic of
   Oncogynaecology, University Hospital - Pleven, Bulgaria for an 8-year
   period. Patients were followed-up until December 2019. We analyzed some
   clinico-pathological characteristics of both malignant conditions as
   demographical data and menopausal status of the patients, as well as the
   histological type and TNM 8 stage of both cancers; we tried to correlate
   them with the rates of overall survival. Results: We explored 1460
   patients' files and identified 6 cases of synchronous cervical and
   endometrial cancers. The mean age of the patients was 58 years (range
   47-65). 5 of them (83.3\%) were diagnosed in menopause. In 1 case (16.7
   \%) the size of the cervical cancer (CC) was > 4 cm (locally advanced
   disease), in 3 cases (50\%) it was below 2 cm, and in the remaining 2
   cases (33.3\%) the CC was only microinvasive. The CC histology was
   squamous cell carcinoma without keratinization in 5 women (83.3\%) and
   in 1 case (16.7\%) - adenosquamous. The histology of all endometrial
   cancers (EC) was endometroid adenocarcinoma and all of them were stage
   I. Conclusions: Co-existence of synchronous cancers of the uterine
   cervix and endometrium does not seem to worsen the prognosis of the
   patients and may even be beneficial: the symptoms of the EC may lead to
   earlier diagnosis of the synchronously existing malignant conditions.}},

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Electron beam shrinking is a technique for manufacturing solid-state
   nanopores with direct visual feedback for better control. The electron
   beam in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) offers the high-resolution
   geometry information of nanostructure during the nanopore manufacturing
   processes. However, the mechanism of electron beam shrinkage is still
   unclear, which hinders the fabrication of solid-state nanopores array as
   well as their applications. In this study, Si3N4 nanopores were used as
   examples to explore the mechanism of electron beam shrinking. The
   morphology and composition characterization of the Si3N4 nanopores
   before and after shrinking revealed that the deposition of hydrocarbons
   dominates the shrinking process, accompanied by some decomposition of
   Si3N4. Based on this model, the controlled shrinking of nanopores was
   achieved, which were assembled into solid state nanopores array. The
   size of the nanopores can be accurately tuned by adjusting the electron
   beam accelerating voltage, beam current, and magnification. Under the
   optimal conditions, the smallest diameter of nanopore of 5.3 nm and the
   fastest shrinkage rate of 2.51 nm/s were obtained. Meanwhile, solidstate
   nanopores array, including an axisymmetric nanopore array structure,
   were also created for detecting translocated AuNPs-DNA through the
   shrunken nanopores. This study demonstrated a facile technique for fine
   control of the shape and size of nanopores with designed array patterns,
   which have great applications in producing nanogap electrodes, complex
   nanostructure, and surface modification or nanostructure repairing on
   different materials with desired geometries.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Coronavirus disease 2019 antibody testing often relies on venous
   blood collection, which is labor-intensive, inconvenient and expensive
   compared with finger-stick capillary dried blood spot (DBS) collection.
   The purpose of our work was to determine if two commercially available
   anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assays for IgG antibodies against spike S1 subunit and
   nucleocapsid proteins could be validated for use with DBS. Materials \&
   methods: Kit supplied reagents were used to extract DBS, and in-house
   DBS calibrators were included on every run. Results: Positive/negative
   concordance between DBS and serum was 100/99.3\% for the spike S1
   subunit assay and 100/98\% for the nucleocapsid assay. Conclusion:
   Validation of the DBS Coronavirus disease 2019 IgG antibody assays
   demonstrated that serum and DBS can produce equivalent results with
   minimal kit modifications.}},

   enabling low surface tension and high viscous organic liquid bouncing}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{402}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Superomniphobicity repelling both water and organic liquids is an
   important feature of special wettability material, which has received
   great attention in surface/interface area. The bottleneck in the real
   application is how to develop robust superomniphobic surface by using
   cost-effective, scalable, facile materials and methods. Here, we report
   a superomniphobic coating by using low-cost and scalable spraying
   suspensions method. The sprayed superomniphobic coating assembles into
   multi-leveled micro/nanostructures with very low apparent surface free
   energy of 12.98 mN m(-1). The coating is capable of diverse organic
   liquids bouncing with liquid surface tension low to 21 mN m(-1) and
   viscosity high to 297.8 mPa s. Remarkably, the coating can be applied in
   different substrates due to the in-situ formed adhesive and demonstrates
   strong mechanical robustness under high pressure water impact (27.8 m
   s(-1)), abrasion and tape-peeling cycles, and sustains exposure to
   highly corrosive aqua regia, extreme low/high temperature and UV
   environments. The organic liquid bouncing behavior related to impact
   velocity and liquid properties were also studied. With facile
   fabrication and multifaceted robustness, our coating paves the way for
   real industrial applications.}},

   substances of anammox sludge and its adsorption preference to refractory
   dissolved organic matter}},
Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{213}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) is an energy saving and
   environmentally friendly technique for wastewater treatment. Sludge
   adsorption is an important process after organics enter the anammox
   reactor. The extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of anammox sludge
   play a key role on the activity of anammox. This study utilized
   Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS)
   to investigate molecular-level compositional characteristics of the
   stratified EPS of the anammox sludge, and to explore the adsorption
   preference of each EPS layer to refractory dissolved organic matter
   (DOM) during anammox treatment. Results showed that the adsorbed
   component by the tightly bound EPS layer was dominantly composed of
   lipids and proteins, with nearly 80\% of formulas being CHO and CHON.
   The outer layers (slime, loosely bound-EPS) preferentially adsorbed the
   compounds with comparatively higher aromatic and unsaturated degrees,
   with S-containing formulas and lignin being the predominant components.
   The newly produced formulas in the effluent were inferred to be
   associated with the anammox treatment performance. The refractory DOM,
   with smaller molecular weight and high reductive degree, seemed to
   experience a single adsorption by the stratified EPS, and became part of
   the anammox sludge. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   acid contents in Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge}},
Journal = {{INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{158}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge is a medicinal plant species commonly used in
   China and other East Asian countries. There is a large market demand for
   this herb, and improving its yield and quality is an urgent problem to
   be solved in production practice. Artificial light sources have been
   widely used in the production of vegetables and medicinal plants, but
   little is known about the effects of light quality on the growth and
   secondary metabolites accumulation in S. miltiorrhiza. In this study,
   the effects of monochromic blue light (460 nm, B), monochromic red light
   (635 nm, R), white light, and various combinations of B and R light
   (9B:1R, 7B:3R, 1B:1R, 3B:7R and 1B:9R) on the growth and phenolic acid
   accumulation of S. miltiorrhiza were investigated. The results showed
   that, the growth and contents of rosmarinic acid and salvianolic acid B
   in S. miltiorrhiza were simultaneously stimulated under 3B:7R. The
   transcripts of key enzyme-encoding genes involved in the rosmarinic acid
   pathway were measured, and the expression of SmPAL1 and Sm4CL1 was
   significantly increased under combined blue and red light. The results
   of site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the GT1-motif in the SmPAL1
   promoter region, I Box, ATC-motif and TCT-motif in the Sm4CL1 promoter
   region were related to the responses of these two genes to combined blue
   and red light. Taken together, the results of this work indicated that,
   the combined blue and red light promoted the growth of S. miltiorrhiza
   and enhanced the accumulation of phenolic acids by up-regulating the
   transcription of SmPAL1 and Sm4CL1 in this herb. Light quality is an
   important environmental factor that effects yield and quality of S.

   Crowding Barrier in the Nuclear Pore}},
Journal = {{CELL REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The nuclear pore complex forms a highly crowded selective barrier with
   intrinsically disordered regions at the nuclear membrane to coordinate
   nucleocytoplasmic molecular communications. Although oxidative stress is
   known to alter the barrier function, the molecular mechanism underlying
   this adaptive control of the nuclear pore complex remains unknown. Here
   we uncover a systematic control of the crowding barrier within the
   nuclear pore in response to various redox environments. Direct
   measurements of the crowding states using a crowding-sensitive FRET
   (Forster resonance energy transfer) probe reveal specific roles of the
   nuclear pore subunits that adjust the degree of crowding in response to
   different redox conditions, by adaptively forming or disrupting
   redox-sensitive disulfide bonds. Relationships between crowding control
   and the barrier function of the nuclear pore are investigated by
   single-molecular fluorescence measurements of nucleartransport. Based on
   these findings, we propose a proximal control model of molecular
   crowding in vivo that is dynamically regulated at the molecular level.}},

Abstract = {{Homocysteine (Hcy) is one of the important biomarkers of clinical
   diagnosis, which is closely related to the occurrence and development of
   many diseases. Current analysis methods have difficulties in detecting
   Hcy in cells and living organisms. As a powerful technique, fluorescence
   methods combined the laser confocal imaging technology can achieve
   real-time visual tracking in cells and in vivo. Herein, we establish a
   conjugated copolymer-based fluorescence nanosensor (DPA-PFNP-Cu(II))
   using the connected 2,7-dibromofluorene and 4,7-bis
   (2-bromothiophen-5-yl)-2-1-3-benzothiadiazole as the main chain. The
   competitive coordination between Hcy and Cu(II) allows the fluorescence
   of the polymer off to on. Finally, the nanosensor is applied for in situ
   imaging of Hcy levels in the kidney and liver of diabetic mice and is
   found that Hcy levels were positively correlated with the degree of
   diabetes. Notably, the depth of tissue penetration of the nanosensor
   enables Hcy detection of the liver and kidney through in vivo imaging
   without damage. Two-photon imaging and in vivo imaging achieve
   consistent results, which correct each other, improving the accuracy of
   the test result. The present works provide a new imaging technique for
   studying the occurrence and development of diabetes and screening of new
   drugs for treatment at the living level.}},

Journal = {{ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{206}},

Abstract = {{A better comprehensive understanding of the influence of soil/solution
   properties on cadmium (Cd) phytotoxicity is essential for soil Cd
   ecological risk assessment. The toxicity of soil spiked Cd to Ligustrum
   japonicum `Howardii' seedling growth was conducted by the greenhouse pot
   experiments using 13 typical forest soils selected from mainland of
   China. The results showed that the ranges of Cd toxicity thresholds of
   10\% seedling growth inhibition (EC10) and 50\% inhibition (EC50)
   followed the order: soil pore water Cd (EC10 on average 0.88 mg L-1 with
   the variation of 54.9 folds and EC50 on average 2.28 mg L(-1 )with
   variation of 41.8 folds), DTPA extractable Cd (EC10 on average 5.4 mg
   kg(-1) with 20.9 folds variation and EC50 on average 17.86 mg kg(-1)
   with 6.6 folds variation), total added Cd (EC10 on average 6.55 mg
   kg(-1) with 16.7 folds variation and EC50 on average 22.11 mg kg(-1)
   with 5.1 folds variation), which suggested that whatever the available
   Cd expressed, its toxicity is largely affected by soil properties. The
   empirical multiple equations were well developed between different
   fractions of Cd toxicity thresholds ECx (x = 10 or 50) and
   soil/solution. The results also showed that the pH inversely correlated
   with EC10 (r(2) = 0.54, P < 0.01) and EC50 (r(2) = 0.63, P < 0.001)
   based on soil pore water, indicating the ECx decreased with more
   toxicity as pH increased. No single significant soil solution properties
   were found for ECx in DTPA extractable Cd. For the ECx of DTPA
   extractable and total Cd, the content of aluminum oxides in soil and
   soil pH were the two significant factors inversely related with ECx,
   which explained 68\%-79\% of the inter-soil variation, respectively.
   Overall, soil or solution pH was the most important factor controlling
   Cd toxicity thresholds. Meanwhile, significant negative correlations
   existed between the soil solution pH and the slopes of parameter (b) of
   the dose-response curves for different fractions of Cd, implying that
   the growth of toxic effect enhanced as unit Cd dosage increased in low
   pH soils. These results will be helpful to evaluate the metal ecological
   risk in forest soils.}},

Title = {{Improved condition monitoring for an FPSO system with multiple
   correlated components}},
Journal = {{MEASUREMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{166}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{It is expected that a resilient condition monitoring (CM) system can
   identify the faults of sensors and key components, assess the system
   risk level based upon multichannel monitoring data, and recover missing
   real data when complete sensor failure occurs. As for CM of an offshore
   system, sensors are usually less reliable than the components being
   monitored. Without CM resilience, the whole system will be vulnerable to
   accidents and different types of disturbance. This paper provides a
   statistical and artificial intelligence approach to realizing resilient
   CM for offshore systems with multiple correlated components. This
   approach enables identifying sensor faults, damage and degradation of
   key components through frequency-centered wavelet analysis along with an
   artificial neural network-based dynamic threshold under different
   operating environments. More importantly, the proposed method enables
   the recovery of missing real data based on fusion data from other normal
   sensors and multivariate Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) model. The
   method is applied to a hawsers' CM system in a Floating Production,
   Storage and Offloading (FPSO) oil offloading system. The numerical
   results illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed
   method in realizing CM resilience for such complex and critical systems.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we briefly reviewed the new non-phosphorous extraction
   systems proposed according to the different applicational ends. These

   systems was to combine the advantages of the substrate and functions of
   the modified chemical group, majorly the diglycolamide-acid. The induced
   physical/chemical properties of the substrate and the functions of
   modified moieties had the potential to import unique traits to the
   as-founded adsorbent, establishing a task-tailored bi-/multi-functional
   system. We believe the new systems had the potential to create new
   adsorption/desorption extraction/bask-extraction paradigms to improve
   the selectivity and capacity of the extraction/adsorption process, as

Abstract = {{For resonant mass sensors, a frequency sweeping procedure is usually
   required to identify the frequency shift in a relative frequency range,
   which is not suitable for detecting incremental mass. The impedance
   detection method can measure mass at a fixed frequency. To further
   explore such sensing mechanism, the main geometrical parameters
   influencing the impedance sensitivity have been carefully analyzed
   considering the electro-mechanical coupling effects, and a series of
   design rules have been proposed for improving sensitivity, e.g.
   increasing the cantilever length and piezoelectric thickness, which is
   contrary to the traditional method of minimizing the geometric size for
   frequency based sensors. Three macro-sized sensors with 21.0 mm, 26.0 mm
   and 30.0mm long cantilevers are fabricated, and the measured impedance
   sensitivities are 212.7 Omega/mg, 514.8 Omega/mg and 737.4 Omega/mg that
   are increasing with the cantilever length, thus validating the design
   rules on cantilever length. However, the frequency sensitivities are
   14.0 Hz/mg, 9.2 Hz/mg, and 7.2 Hz/mg that are decreasing with the
   cantilever length. Furthermore, the impedance sensitivity is much higher
   than the frequency sensitivity, and the design map of the sensor is
   presented as an overall guideline for structure optimization.}},

Abstract = {{Pullulan was successfully esterified with octenyl succinic anhydride
   (OSA) in aqueous alkaline solutions. The degree of substitution (DS) was
   regulated from 0.0163, 0.0346 to 0.0469 by changing the OSA
   concentration (3.0\%, 6.0\% and 9.0\%, respectively). Meanwhile, the
   weight-average molecular weight (M-w) of OSA-pullulans varied from 2.050
   x 10(5), 2.113 x 10(5) to 2.124 x 10(5). The chemical structures of
   OSA-pullulans were char-acterized by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
   and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 NMR), which
   indicated that OSA groups were successfully grafted into pullulan. The
   surface tension, interfacial tension and droplet size of the emulsions
   stabilized by OSA-pullulans significantly reduced with the increase of
   DS. Furthermore, the emulsion stability (ES) and viscosity dramatically
   increased with DS compared with those of emulsion stabilized by
   pullulan. These results indicated emulsifying properties of
   OSA-pullulans were improved by increasing DS. Additionally,
   OSA-pullulans had excellent emulsion stability when DS was higher than
   0.0346.}},

Abstract = {{During high-speed machining (HSM) of high-strength steel, the poor
   surface integrity of workpiece affects its service performance. HSM of
   AISI 4340 steel is carried out by a TiCN-NbC composite coated tool in
   dry milling conditions. For the machined surface, the surface roughness,
   microstructure, residual stress and micro-hardness are measured to
   discuss the surface integrity evaluation. The minimum variation of
   surface roughness R-a with tool wear is obtained at v(c) = 350 m/min.
   The microstructure characteristics with twins, dislocations or their
   combination is also observed by using electron backscattered diffraction
   (EBSD) technique, which can result in the surface transformation and
   recrystallization. The appropriate plastic deformation causes the work
   hardening degree to be controlled within the range of 110\%-120\%. The
   compressive residual stress is achieved, which is benefit to seal the
   micro-cracks in the surface layer. The research results will be able to
   promote the high-quality processing of AISI 4340 steel parts. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{Two kinds of Fe/C nanofibers were prepared by electrospinning and

   adjust the size of the Fe nanoparticles by using different spinning
   solvents. The one was prepared by a mixture of water and anhydrous
   alcohol as solvents (named as CNFwater) and the other by
   N,N-Dimethylformamide and anhydrous alcohol (named as CNFDMF). Due to
   the higher solubility to iron salts and larger surface tension of water,
   CNF(water )gained a larger size of Fe nanoparticles and average
   diameter. In addition, the graphite layers wrapped on Fe nanoparticles
   which were formed during calcination were thinner in CNFwater than
   CNFDMF. These factors endowed CNFwater better microwave absorption
   performance. The results of XRD, SEM, HRTEM, Raman, magnetostatic and

Abstract = {{The conjugate prepared from (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and soy
   protein isolate (SPI) under alkaline and aerobic conditions was analyzed
   using a Nano-LC-Q-Orbitrap-MS/MS technique. The sulfhydryl and free
   amino groups of SPI were involved in covalent binding. Fifty-one
   peptides were conjugated with EGCG. Fifty-nine modified sites were
   identified, located on Cys, His, Arg, and Lys, respectively. It is the
   first time to confirm that each of the two phenolic rings of EGCG
   contained a reactive site that bound to an amino acid residue. The amino
   acid residue reactivity, amino acid sequence and composition affected
   the EGCG binding site in SPI. Lys and Arg residues are the most likely
   sites for modification, and modification appears to reduce IgE binding.
   This study is helpful to elucidate the pattern of covalent binding of
   polyphenols to proteins in food systems and provides a theoretical basis
   for the directional modification of soy proteins with polyphenols.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Rainstorm events can flush large amounts of terrestrial organic-rich
   material into lakes that are used for drinking water. To date, few
   studies have been carried out to investigate how rainstorm events change
   the molecular composition, bio-lability, and flux of upstream-imported
   dissolved organic matter (DOM), which can impact the odor and taste of
   drinking water as well as the efficiency of wastewater treatment. We
   undertook high-frequency buoy monitoring and point sample collection (n
   = 495), during high, moderate, and low inflow discharge, in Lake
   Qiandao, a key drinking water source for about 10 million people. Data
   from two online fluorescent DOM sensors deployed and field samples
   collected at the river site, Jiekou, and the lake site, Xiaojinshan,
   showed that rainstorm events increased the specific UV absorbance
   (SUVA254), humification index (HIX), humic-like components (C1-C2), and
   FT-ICR MS derived condensed aromatic and polyphenolic compounds (p <
   0.001) and decreased the spectral slope of DOM (S 275-295 ), spectral
   slope ratio (S-R), biological index (BIX), and highly bio-degradable
   peptide-like and aliphatic substances (p < 0.001). Our results suggest
   that rainstorm events enhanced the export to the lake of colored,
   hydrophobic, and aromatic DOM. Upstream-derived dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC) concentrations decreased (p < 0.001), while DOC bio-availability
   (BDOC) increased only slightly (p < 0.05) during rainstorm events. The
   loss rate of DOC in Lake Qiandao is 0.82 x 10(4) t C yr(-1), of which
   0.30 x 10(4) t C yr(-1) is highly bio-labile, and higher occurrences of
   both 25 mm d (- 1) and > 50 mm d (- 1) rainfall events are anticipated
   by linear fittings for this region in the future. The application of in
   situ fluorescence sensors provides an early warning of DOC surge
   incidents caused by rainstorm events and may be useful in advising
   drinking water treatment plant managers of changes in raw water DOM
   quality and treatability. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   composite membranes by interfacial polymerization}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{616}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Polyamide composite membranes are still required to promote their
   structure uniformity and desalination performance. Herein, a
   vacuum-assisted strategy was used to deal with this challenge by
   improving the distribution homogeneity of diamine monomer in porous
   substrates for typical interfacial polymerization. Laser scanning
   confocal microscope analyses demonstrate that the piperazine solution
   can be adsorbed in the microporous substrates with a very homogeneous
   and stable way. This uniform diamine distribution shows great advantages
   for synthesizing the selective layers of polyamide on the substrate
   surfaces via the interfacial polymerization of piperazine and trimesoyl
   chloride. The as-prepared polyamide layers with a circular size of 30 cm
   exhibit uniform structures including thickness less than 20 nm,
   cross-linking degree up to 100\%, surface roughness lower than 20 nm and
   pore diameter about 0.41 nm. Therefore, the polyamide composite
   membranes present nanofiltration performances of ultrahigh rejection
   above 99.6\% to Na2SO4 and high water permeability of 20 L/m(2) h bar.
   These membranes also show a promising selectivity for NaCl/Na2SO4 up to
   196, which is higher than most of the commercial and the reported
   nanofiltration membranes in recent years.}},

Title = {{In-situ formed N-doped bamboo-like carbon nanotubes encapsulated with Fe
   nanoparticles supported by biochar as highly efficient catalyst for
   activation of persulfate (PS) toward degradation of organic pollutants}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{402}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{In this study, N-doped bamboo-like carbon nanotubes encapsulated with Fe
   nanoparticles (Fe NPs) on the surface of soybean dregs-derived biochar
   (Fe@NCNT - BC) was synthesized via a low-cost and facile strategy. The
   unique composites behaved as efficient catalysts for the degradation of
   various organic pollutants by the activation of persulfate (PS). Under
   the conditions of {[}PS] = 5 mM, {[}RhB] = 20 mg/L, {[}Fe@NCNT-BC-800] =
   1.0 g/L, pH = 7.0, the RhB degradation rate was very fast reaching up to
   100\% within 10 min. The system also exhibited significant high activity
   in a broad pH window (3.0-11.0). Meanwhile, the recycling experiments
   and Fe leaching tests further demonstrated the stability of Fe@NCNT - BC
   during the activation of PS. Most interestingly, the Fe nanoparticles
   played a key role in promoting the degree of graphitization and the
   formation of bamboo-like N-doped carbon nanotubes. Besides, the
   introduction of biochar significantly improved the dispersion ability to
   the Fe@NCNT - BC. The competitive radical quenching tests and electron
   paramagnetic resonance measurements (ESR) illustrated that instead of
   the traditional radicals (sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals), the
   non-radical singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) was the dominant reactive oxidative
   species (ROS) in the Fe@NCNT-BC/PS system. A mechanistic study suggested
   that pyridinic N, graphitic N, sp(2)-hybridized carbon structure and C =
   O bond in the Fe@NCNT - BC - 800 promoted the generation of the ROS.
   This study successfully provides an economic and feasible method for
   synthesis of a novel catalyst as an eco-friendly and efficient material
   for the degradation of organic pollutants in the environment.}},

Title = {{Improving Estimation of Seasonal Evapotranspiration in Australian
   Tropical Savannas using a Flexible Drought Index}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{295}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Savannas, occupying a fifth of the global land surface, are
   characterized by the coexistence of trees and grasses. Accurate
   estimation of savanna evapotranspiration (ET) is vital for understanding
   the regional and global water balance and its feedback to climate.
   However, the overlapping phenology and different water-use patterns of
   trees and grasses constitute a major challenge for modeling efforts. To
   estimate savanna ET, we used a three-source ET model, partitioning ET
   among soil, trees, and grasses. To represent legacy effects of
   precipitation on ecosystem water use, the Normalized Ecosystem Drought
   Index (NEDI, i.e. a function of precipitation and potential
   evapotranspiration) was included to limit canopy conductances in the
   model and also in two other classic two-layer models
   (Shuttleworth-Wallace model and Penman-Monteith-Leuning model). The
   results of our model and the other models were tested and compared using
   tower-based eddy covariance flux data collected at six sites (including
   four savanna sites, one pasture site, and one grassland site) along a
   precipitation gradient in northern Australia, together with
   satellite-derived leaf area index, which was partitioned to represent
   the canopy dynamics of trees and grasses. Inclusion of NEDI
   significantly reduced seasonal biases in ET estimation results for all
   models compared with observations at savanna sites (fitted slopes were
   closer to unity by 0.08-0.10, R-2 increased by 0.03-0.04, and RMSE
   decreased by 0.07-0.09 mm d(-1)). The three-source model provides
   insights into simulation of water fluxes over vegetated areas of complex
   composition. Our work makes a contribution to savanna research by
   determining a flexible indicator defining the seasonal water
   availability limitation on savanna ET. The inclusion of NEDI in ET
   models could guide future research on modeling ecosystem water and
   carbon fluxes in response to seasonal droughts.}},

Title = {{Contesting and envisioning ``trygghet{''}: The Sweden Democrats, Social
   Democrats, and the 2018 Swedish General Election}},
Journal = {{AREA}},
Abstract = {{In September 2018, international observers were fixated on Sweden as
   voters went to the polls. With the national populist party, the Sweden
   Democrats, predicted to gain significant support, commentators
   sardonically speculated whether this might finally spell the last
   bastion of social democracy's fall from grace? Against the backdrop of
   the 2015 refugee crisis and growing violent crime rates, would Sweden
   finally succumb to the emotive appeal of populism? In this paper, we
   argue for an analysis that starts at the national level to fully
   appreciate the elements that made Swedish populism unique to its
   socio-cultural context. We propose that a geopolitics of language fused
   with ideas from the ``affective turn{''} is uniquely poised to analyse
   the deeply affective connotations of territorial metaphors and the
   structures of feelings associated with them. This is done by showing how
   the 2018 election centred on competing mobilisations of the Swedish
   concept of trygghet. This affectively loaded concept, denoting a
   structure of feeling of comforting and holistic safety, finds no
   equivalent in the Anglophone world. Taking insights from two
   ethnographic research projects, conducted with the Sweden Democrats and
   the Social Democrats, we argue that trygghet serves as a rich
   socio-cultural heuristic device that conveys the geohistorical
   specificities underpinning the 2018 Swedish elections. Indeed, we show
   the links between the Swedish notions of trygghet and the folkhem
   (people's home) to help explain the rise of Swedish populism.}},

Title = {{Professional Training Needs for Using Augmentative and Alternative
   Communication in Inclusive Classrooms: Voices From Saudi Arabia}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SPECIAL EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Research reveals that augmentative and alternative communication (AAC)
   can improve the communication competency of students who have complex
   communication needs. However, special educators often lack the
   competencies to effectively implement AAC strategies in the classroom.
   The present study aimed to explore the special educators' level of need
   for professional training in AAC. Furthermore, it explored whether
   certain educator, student, and classroom characteristics were associated
   with the level of professional need for AAC training. In this
   descriptive study, 869 special educators in Saudi Arabia responded to a
   survey. The findings show that there is a high level of need for a wide
   variety of training areas in AAC. The findings indicate that
   participants differed significantly in their levels of need for
   professional AAC training depending on the participants' previous
   training and experience, as well as the category of students taught,
   level of education, and grade level. Implications for how AAC training
   programs can be customized to effectively meet the diverse needs of
   educators and their students are discussed.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{The understanding of the domain wall (DW) dynamics along magnetic
   nanowires is crucial for spintronic applications. In this work, we
   perform a detailed analysis of the transverse DW motion along nanowires
   with polygonal cross-sections. If the DW displaces under a magnetic
   field above the Walker limit, the oscillatory motion of the DW is
   observed. The amplitude, the frequency of oscillations, and the DW
   velocity depend on the number of sides of the nanowire cross-section,
   being the DW velocity in a wire with a triangular cross-section one
   order of magnitude larger than that in a circular nanowire. The decrease
   in the nanowire cross-section area yields a DW behavior similar to the
   one presented in a cylindrical nanowire, which is explained using an
   analytical model based on the general kinetic momentum theorem.
   Micromagnetic simulations reveal that the oscillatory behavior of the DW
   comes from energy changes due to deformations of the DW shape during the
   rotation around the nanowire.}},

Abstract = {{This work demonstrated the development of conducting poly(chrysoidine G)
   (PCG)-gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-modified fluorine-doped tin oxide (F :
   SnO2, FTO) film-coated glass electrodes for the sensitive
   electrochemical detection of nitrite (NO2-). The homogeneously
   distributed PCG nanoparticle layer was deposited onto the FTO electrode
   by cyclic voltammetry sweeping. AuNPs were then anchored onto the
   PCG/FTO electrode by the chemical reduction of pre-adsorbed Au3+ ions.
   The as-prepared AuNP/PCG/FTO electrode exhibited excellent
   electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of NO2- with high
   sensitivity (approximately 0.63 mA cm(-2) mM(-1)) and a low limit of
   detection (0.095 mu M), which is relevant within the normal
   concentration range of NO2- in human bodily fluids. The AuNP/PCG/FTO
   sensor showed sufficient reproducibility, repeatability, low
   interference, and strong recovery for NO2- detection in food samples.
   These results indicate that the AuNP/PCG nanocomposites have immense
   potential for the electrochemical detection of other biologically
   important compounds.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of adding an
   essential fatty acid mixture (EOM;Eucalyptus globulus Labill, thymus
   vulgaris, Cymbopogon nardus, andSyzygium aromaticum) to the drinking
   water in the heat stress broilers on the adipokine (Apelin, BDNF)
   response, the histopathologic changes in liver and intestines, and some
   biochemical parameters. This study lasted for a total of 42 days,
   including the physical exercise period (7 days) and the fattening period
   (35 days). A total of 400 Ross 308 male broilers (1-d-old) were randomly
   divided into 8 groups (50 animals per group), each of which was exposed
   to various conditions of temperature (C: 22 degrees C and SC: 36 degrees
   C) and treatment dose (C, 250, 500 and 750 mL/1000 L). Each group was
   divided into 5 subgroups, each comprising 10 animals. In the stress-free
   groups, whereas the Apelin level linearly decreased, the BDNF level
   linearly increased. In histopathology, the liver tissue was found to be
   normal in all groups whereas the duodenum villi length was found to
   increase in the group of 750 mL/1000 L. No statistically significant
   difference was found between the stressed groups and the non-stressed
   groups in terms of VLDL, Glucose, Total bilirubin, ALT, and TG (p> .05).
   While Apelin level increased in the stressed groups, the BDNF level
   increased in the group of 250 mL/1000 L. In the histopathological
   examination, a small amount of coagulation necrosis was detected in
   hepatocyte, a diffuse hydropic degeneration was observed in hepatocytes,
   and finally a dilatation and hyperaemia were seen in sinusoid in the
   groups of EOM-500 mL/1000 L and EOM-750 m/1000 L compared to the control
   group. Whereas there was no difference between the group of EOM-250
   mL/1000 L and the control group in terms of duodenum villa length, there
   was a significant decrease in other groups (p< .00). In conclusion, this
   study showed that adding 250 mL/1000 L of EOM to the drinking water had
   a positive effect on the serum levels of Apelin and p-BDNF in the groups
   exposed to stress (p<.05).}},

   modifications without the need for double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs)
   induced by conventional CRIPSR/Cas9-based approaches. However, most
   approaches that employ ABEs require inefficient downstream technologies
   to identify desired targeted mutations within large populations of
   manipulated cells. In this study, we developed a fluorescence-based
   method, named ``Cas9-mediated adenosine transient reporter for editing
   enrichment{''} (CasMAs-TREE; herein abbreviated XMAS-TREE), to
   facilitate the real-time identification of base-edited cell
   populations.ResultsTo establish a fluorescent-based assay able to detect
   ABE activity within a cell in real time, we designed a construct
   encoding a mCherry fluorescent protein followed by a stop codon (TGA)
   preceding the coding sequence for a green fluorescent protein (GFP),
   allowing translational readthrough and expression of GFP after A-to-G
   conversion of the codon to ``TGG.{''} At several independent loci, we
   demonstrate that XMAS-TREE can be used for the highly efficient
   purification of targeted cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that XMAS-TREE
   can be employed in the context of multiplexed editing strategies to
   simultaneous modify several genomic loci. In addition, we employ
   XMAS-TREE to efficiently edit human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), a
   cell type traditionally resistant to genetic modification. Furthermore,
   we utilize XMAS-TREE to generate clonal isogenic hPSCs at target sites
   not editable using well-established reporter of transfection (RoT)-based
   strategies.ConclusionWe established a method to detect adenosine
   base-editing activity within a cell, which increases the efficiency of
   editing at multiple genomic locations through an enrichment of edited
   cells. In the future, XMAS-TREE will greatly accelerate the application
   of ABEs in biomedical research.}},

Title = {{Natural radiole damage and regeneration in the feather duster worm
   Schizobranchia insignis}},
Journal = {{INVERTEBRATE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{139}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The feather duster worm Schizobranchia insignis is an abundant marine
   annelid found subtidally and in the low intertidal of the northeastern
   Pacific Ocean. As in other sabellids, the anterior appendages, used for
   feeding and respiration, can be damaged by physical or biological means.
   Limited information is available on the regeneration of radioles leading
   us to study this process on a worm with radioles that dichotomously
   branch. First, we documented the occurrence of natural radiole damage in
   two populations of S. insignis found at environmentally distinct sites:
   a subtidal marina and an intertidal, rocky bench. All 21 worms collected
   from the exposed intertidal bench had branchial crown damage, whereas 15
   of 22 worms (68\%) sampled in the marina exhibited natural radiole
   damage. In the laboratory, we observed radiole regeneration on
   individuals of S. insignis from the marina by removing a single radiole.
   Radiole regrowth was a continuous process in which functionality was
   restored through radiole bifurcation, elongation, and the development of
   internal support structures. The regrowth of a single radiole of S.
   insignis took more than 35 days. However, in one of our studies, after
   21 days, although not all individuals recovered, four of 12 worms (33\%)
   had completed bifurcation. Pointed tips on the distal-most branches
   signified the end of bifurcation. During recovery, individuals of S.
   insignis did not consistently regenerate the same number of branches
   observed prior to damage. In addition, a majority of the radiole
   elongation during recovery occurred after branching. The radiole
   regeneration in Eudistylia vancouveri, a closely related species found
   in the marina, was observed to compare regeneration in co-occurring
   species. We found that the radiole regeneration in E. vancouveri was
   less complex because of the absence of branching. Since Schizobranchia
   is the only genus in which radioles are branched, our study of S.
   insignis provides a unique examination of natural radiole damage and
   regrowth.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose This study aims to critically expose and explore ``taking
   sides{''} in the context of a covert ethnography of bouncers in the
   night-time economy of Manchester, UK. Design/methodology/approach The
   methodology adopted is covert ethnography. The author reflects on the
   application and use of situated deception within an embedded and insider
   ethnography of bouncers, alongside other relevant covert ethnographies.
   Fieldwork vignettes are drawn upon to articulate the management of
   situated ethics and moral dilemmas. Findings The findings argue that
   bouncers are a deeply maligned occupational group, who perform a
   valuable regulatory role in the night-time economy. Moreover, a covert
   role ethnographic presents an interesting liminal stance of being on
   both sides, rather than a reductionist choosing of a single sides.
   Theoretically, phenomenological bracketing and ethnomethodological
   indifference are used to justify the position taken in the paper.
   Research limitations/implications Covert research has limitations around
   fieldwork time consumption, instigation tactics and ``going native{''}
   distortion, alongside common fears of ethical belligerence and cavalier
   morals. Practical implications The lessons learnt, particularly for
   early career researchers, are about pursuing creative ethnographic
   methods. Social implications Occupationally, bouncers should be less
   demonized and more accessible to more women. This rather hyper-masculine
   domain should be disrupted and democratized. Originality/value The field
   is relatively niche, with a purist covert ethnographic approach being an
   innovative way to unpack it.}},

Abstract = {{Background: There are limited data comparing the oncologic and fertility
   outcomes of patients with early-stage cervical cancer (CC) treated by
   minimally invasive radical trachelectomy (MIRT) or abdominal radical
   trachelectomy (ART). The purpose of this multicenter study is to compare
   the oncologic and fertility outcomes of patients treated by MIRT or ART
   in a randomized controlled manner in China.
   Methods: This is a noninferiority, randomized controlled trial performed
   at 28 Chinese centers; the study is designed to compare the oncologic
   and fertility outcomes of patients treated by MIRT (robot-assisted or
   laparoscopic RT) or ART. Patients will be recruited if they have been
   diagnosed with stage IA1 (with lymphovascular space invasion), IA2, or
   IB1 CC (with a maximum tumor diameter <= 2 cm) in the FIGO 2009 staging
   system and histological subtypes of squamous carcinoma, adenocarcinoma,
   or adenosquamous carcinoma and if they are also aged 18 to 40 years.
   These candidates will be randomly assigned to undergo MIRT or ART. The
   primary endpoint will be disease-free survival. Secondary endpoints will
   consist of overall and disease-free survival rates, fertility outcomes,
   and quality of life. A total of 414 patients are needed to accomplish
   the study goal, with 90.1\% power at a 0.050 significance level to
   detect an equivalence hazard ratio of 0.75 in the ART group, considering
   20\% loss to follow-up.
   Discussion: The results of the trial should provide robust evidence to
   surgeons regarding options for the surgical approach in patients with
   early-stage CC who have a strong willingness to preserve fertility.}},

Abstract = {{Phosgene is an indispensable industrial gas that has high toxicity, and
   has been used as a chemical warfare agent, meaning that it poses a great
   threat to public security in the case of accidental leakage or terrorist
   attack. To monitor toxic phosgene, herein, we devised a facile and
   reliable optical sensor (BODIPY-OHA) based on o-hydroxyaniline (OHA) and
   BODIPY. The adjacent hydroxyl and amino groups in OHA synergistically
   couple with phosgene to form benzoxazolinone, thus BODIPY-OHA displays a
   remarkable color change from light green to yellow and a synchronous
   fluorescence turn-on response towards phosgene. The sensor can be used
   to specifically sense phosgene, with some favorable merits such as
   instantaneous response, ultralow detection limit (0.22 nM), noticeable
   color and fluorescence changes, as well as a high signal-to-noise ratio.
   Furthermore, this sensor was fabricated as portable membrane strips to
   serve as an easy-to-handle kit for highly specific, instantaneous,
   sensitive and visual detection of gaseous phosgene. Moreover, a simple
   RGB pattern from the fluorescence of test strips was established to
   allow quantitative determination of the level of phosgene, which was
   successfully used to monitor the leakage of phosgene. Therefore, these
   test strips have great potential for monitoring phosgene in public
   places and industrial production in the case of accidental leakage or
   terrorist attack.}},

Abstract = {{Lignin component in lignocellulosic biomass always adversely affects the
   efficiency of its enzymatic saccharification and subsequent bioethanol
   production. To mitigate the lignin inhibition, this work thoroughly
   evaluated the effectiveness of deacetylation and steam pretreatment for
   improved fermentable sugars and bioethanol production from hardwood as
   well as quantified the relative contribution of lignin toward physical
   blockage effect and unproductive adsorption effect on cellulose
   hydrolysis. It was found that deacetylation reduced the formation of
   acid catalyst, thus significantly mitigating lignin inhibition on
   cellulose hydrolysis. The addition of Na2S in deacetylation was more
   liable in improving biomass porosity, and the addition of Na2SO3 was
   more favorable for removing surface lignin; both of these factors
   contributed to the decreased physical blockage effect of lignin.
   Besides, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results indicated that
   deacetylation distinctly suppressed the undesirable lignin
   repolymerization and the formation of phenolic hydroxyl groups, which
   could alleviate the unproductive adsorption effect of lignin. When
   lignin was isolated from the deacetylationsteam-pretreated substrates
   and added to the enzymatic hydrolysis of Avicel, a distinctly lower
   lignin inhibition was observed compared to the samples without
   deacetylation. Besides, the lignin inhibition showed a strong
   correlation with the extent of lignin repolymerization, proving the
   lignin inhibition mitigating effect of deacetylation through
   modification of the lignin structure.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of the study is to recognise whether epoxy resin or
   polyurethane internal linings of ductile iron (DI) pipes create visibly
   smaller head loss in flow than cement mortar linings. Some data reported
   by the Ductile Iron Pipes Research Association (DIPRA) was used in the
   calculations. Only the data from hydraulic tests performed no later than
   30 years after the placing of the mortar lining were considered. The
   average values of the Hazen-Williams roughness coefficients C for each
   of the internal pipe diameters were calculated, and single experimental
   data neglected. Two different approaches were taken for interpreting the
   DIPRA experimental results and omitting the fact that the flow rates
   during these tests are unknown. The Hazen-Williams roughness
   coefficients C were used in both for computing the friction factor f
   from the Moody chart for three values of flow rate: being equal to the
   optimal value for a given diameter, and then by 50\% larger and 50\%
   smaller than this value. Next, the computed friction factors were
   compared with the values predicted from the Moody chart for smooth
   pipes. In the first approach, the friction factors f were computed using
   the Epanet2 software, and in the second approach, a general equation for
   calculating f from known C and flow parameters was applied. Both
   approaches resulted in friction factors f very close to those for smooth
   pipes for the whole range of Q. In conclusion, more smooth plastic
   linings of DI pipes do not result in a significantly more visible saving
   of energy for pumping.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new data-driven fixed-order H infinity controller
   design method based on convex optimisation is proposed for linear single
   input single output systems. The proposed non-parametric frequency
   domain data based approach renders the need for a mathematical model of
   the controlled plant unnecessary. First, a semi-definite convex
   optimisation algorithm is proposed to simultaneously compute a minimal
   uncertainty model and an optimal nominal model from the experimental
   data. Then the H infinity robust performance condition, control input
   constraints and the closed-loop model matching objective are described
   by convex functions with respect to the parameters of the controller.
   The usefulness and efficiency of the proposed approach are verified
   experimentally with application to the control of a thrust vector
   control system.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(acrylamide-co-acrylic acid) (P(AAm-co-AA)-X) was prepared by
   RAFT/MADIX and used as a hydrophilic macromolecular chain transfer agent
   (macroCTA) in the aqueous emulsion copolymerization of vinyl acetate
   (VAc) and ethylene. Stable latexes were obtained over a broad range of
   conditions with macroCTA contents ranging from 1 to 65 wt\% (compared to
   the initial amount of VAc) and ethylene pressure from 10 to 100 bar. The
   different systems investigated generated latexes incorporating amorphous
   to semi-crystalline poly(vinyl acetate-co-ethylene) (P(VAc-co-E)) chains
   using macroCTA content as low as 1 wt\% in the absence of additional
   surfactant. The particle nucleation mechanism was investigated with the
   help of kinetic studies using cryogenic transmission electronic
   microscopy (cryoTEM) and was consistent with the concepts underlying
   polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA). High solids content latexes
   were finally targeted with a formulation more in line with industrial
   constraints (0.4 wt\% macroCTA, 35 bar ethylene pressure, semi-batch
   conditions). A stable P(VAc-co-E) latex was produced exhibiting a solids
   content of 38 wt\%. This work provides an easy access to a full range of
   alternative stabilization modes for P(VAc-co-E) latexes and potentially
   to new VAE and EVA products.}},

Title = {{Experimental and numerical approach to resolve particle deposition on
   dimpled heat transfer surfaces locally and temporally}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{227}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{When optimizing the performance of heat exchangers, it can be
   advantageous to introduce structures, such as dimples or ribs on the
   surface. One especially advantageous solution in terms of
   thermohydraulic efficiency is to use surfaces with spherical dimples,
   where heat transfer is increased at an only minor pressure loss
   increase. However, this surface structuring also influences the
   deposition of particles in aqueous suspensions. The resulting fouling is
   a serious problem for the design and operation of heat exchangers and
   can cause significant economic and ecological damage. Despite the
   knowledge of the importance of fouling and the resulting disadvantages,
   this knowledge has not been incorporated systematically into the design
   process, and the criteria of maximizing heat transfer and reducing
   hydraulic losses remain in the foreground during the design of heat
   exchangers.
   In this study, dimpled surfaces with a depth to diameter ration of 0.18,
   0.26 and 0.35 were evaluated by measuring and comparing their heat
   transfer ability and pressure loss with and without the occurrence of
   particulate fouling from aqueous suspensions. The fouling resistance is
   used to assess the reduction in heat transfer efficiency due to
   particulate depositions, both local and time resolved. For the first
   time, a row of dimples is quantitatively assessed regarding its heat
   transfer efficiency under fouling conditions, and the thermo-hydraulic
   efficiency is determined experimentally. The results are matched against
   numerical investigations. The interactions of turbulent flow structures,
   heat transfer and particulate fouling in aqueous suspension are
   determined for dimpled surfaces. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Background Recent studies have revealed that serpin peptidase inhibitor
   clade E member 2 (SERPINE2) is associated with tumorigenesis. However,
   SERPINE2 expression and its role in lung adenocarcinomas are still
   unknown. Methods The expression levels of SERPINE2 in 74 consecutively
   resected lung adenocarcinomas were analyzed by using immunostaining.
   Inhibition of SERPINE2 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) was
   detected by quantitative PCR. Cell number assays and cell apoptosis
   assays were performed to clarify the cell-autonomous function of
   SERPINE2 in A549 and PC9 lung cancer cells. Results The overall survival
   of patients with high SERPINE2 expression was significantly worse than
   that of patients with low SERPINE2 expression (P = 0.0172). Multivariate
   analysis revealed that SERPINE2 expression was an independent factor
   associated with poor prognosis (P = 0.03237). The interference of
   SERPINE2 decreased cell number and increased apoptosis in A549 and PC9
   cells Conclusion These results suggest that SERPINE2 can be used as a
   novel prognostic marker of lung adenocarcinoma.}},

Abstract = {{Cell culture based live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) as an
   alternative to egg-based LAIV have been explored because of lack of easy
   access to SPF eggs for large scale production. In this study,
   feasibility of MDCK platform was assessed by including multiple LAIV
   strains covering both type A (H1 and H3) and type B seasonal strains as
   well as the candidate pandemic potential strains like A/H5 and A/H7 for
   the growth in MDCK cells. A risk assessment study was conducted on the
   cell banks to evaluate safety concerns related to tumorigenicity with a
   regulatory perspective. Tumorigenic potential of the MDCK cells was
   evaluated in nude mice (10(7)cells/mouse) model system. The 50\% tumor
   producing dose (TPD50) of MDCK cells was studied in SCID mice to
   determine the amount of cells required for induction of tumors. Further,
   we conducted an oncogenicity study in three sensitive rodent species as
   per the requirements specified in the WHO guidelines.
   We determined TPD50 value of 1.9 X 10(4) cells/mice through subcutaneous
   route. Our results suggest that, the intranasal route of administration
   of the cell culture based LAIV pose minimal to no risk of tumorigenicity
   associated with the host cells. Also, non-oncogenic nature of MDCK cells
   was demonstrated. Host cell DNA in the vaccine formulations was < 10
   ng/dose which ensures vaccine safety. Production efficiency and
   consistency were characterized and the observed titer values of the
   viral harvest and the processed bulk were comparable to the expansion in
   embryonated eggs.
   The present study clearly establishes the suitability of MDCK cells as a
   substrate for the manufacture of a safe and viable LAIV. (c) 2020

Abstract = {{The professionalism of teachers through collaboration has become
   increasingly important in the last years. This paper describes the
   process of designing and validating a questionnaire for the analysis of
   future Primary and Pre-school teachers' collaboration patterns. The
   psychometric properties of the scale were obtained from the analysis of
   the validity of content (expert judgement and pilot test to 293 students
   of Primary Education and Pre-school Education at a Spanish university
   and from construct (factor analysis) and reliability (Cronbach Alpha),
   obtaining appropiate results (KMO = 0.89; CFI = 0.91; GFI = 0.95; AGFI =
   0.96; SMSR = 0.05). Four factors were identified in the questionnaire on
   collaboration and shared professional learning: Assertiveness and
   personal willingness to work together, Group Cohesion, Leadership
   Capacity and Group Awareness. The results obtained are consistent with
   empirical studies carried out on the teachers' willingness towards
   collaboration, ongoing training and teacher professional development.}},

Abstract = {{While the gold standard for clinical trials is to blind all
   parties-participants, researchers, and evaluators-to treatment
   assignment, this is not always a possibility. When some or all of the
   above individuals know the treatment assignment, this leaves the study
   open to the introduction of postrandomization biases. In the Strategies
   to Reduce Injuries and Develop Confidence in Elders (STRIDE) trial, we
   were presented with the potential for the unblinded clinicians
   administering the treatment, as well as the individuals enrolled in the
   study, to introduce ascertainment bias into some but not all events
   comprising the primary outcome. In this article, we present ways to
   estimate the ascertainment bias for a time-to-event outcome, and discuss
   its impact on the overall power of a trial vs changing of the outcome
   definition to a more stringent unbiased definition that restricts
   attention to measurements less subject to potentially differential
   assessment. We found that for the majority of situations, it is better
   to revise the definition to a more stringent definition, as was done in
   STRIDE, even though fewer events may be observed.}},

Abstract = {{Recent comparative studies show that cooperative breeding is positively
   correlated with harsh and unpredictable environments and it is suggested
   that this association occurs because helpers buffer the negative effects
   of adverse ecological conditions on fitness.
   In the Kalahari, rainfall varies widely between- and within years,
   affecting primary production and the availability of the principal prey
   of cooperatively breeding Kalahari meerkats, Suricata suricatta. Our
   study aimed to establish whether the presence and number of helpers
   buffer the negative effects of variation in rainfall on the fecundity
   and body mass of breeding females, and the survival and growth of pups.
   We investigate the relationship between group size and variation in
   rainfall on dominant female fecundity, body mass, and offspring survival
   and growth using an additive modelling approach on 21 years of
   individual-based records of the life histories of individual meerkats.
   We show that breeding female fecundity is reduced during periods of low
   rainfall but that the effects of low rainfall are mitigated by increases
   in group size and body mass because heavier females and those in larger
   groups have increased fecundity and reduced interbirth intervals. Pup
   growth and survival are also reduced during periods of low rainfall, but
   only in smaller groups.
   Our results support the suggestion that cooperative breeding mitigates
   the detrimental effects of adverse environmental conditions and may
   enhance the capacity of species to occupy environments where food
   availability is low and unpredictable.}},

Abstract = {{Tamoxifen resistance is emerging as a big challenge in endocrine therapy
   of luminal A breast cancer patients. In this study, we aimed to
   determine the molecular changes of PI3K/AKT/PTEN signaling pathway
   during tamoxifen-resistance development using gradually increased doses
   of tamoxifen in one model, while fixing tamoxifen treatment dose at 35
   mu M for several times in the second model. An upregulation of AKT/PI3K
   genes was noticed at 30 mu M tamoxifen concentration in cells treated
   with a gradual increase of tamoxifen doses. In the second model,
   significant upregulation of AKT1 was seen in cells treated with 35 mu M
   tamoxifen for three times. All genes studied showed a significant
   increase in expression in resistant cells treated with 50 mu M and 35 mu
   M six times tamoxifen. These genes' upregulation was accompanied by PTEN
   and GSK3 ss genes' down-regulation, and it was in correlation to the
   changes in the metabolic rate of glucose in tamoxifen-resistant models.
   A significant increase in glucose consumption rate from culture media
   was observed in tamoxifen resistant cells with the highest consumption
   rate reported in the first day of culturing. Increased glucose
   consumption rates were also correlated with GLUL significant gene
   expression and non-significant change in c-MYC gene expression that may
   lead to increased endogenous glutamine synthesis. As a result, several
   molecular and metabolic changes precede acquired tamoxifen resistance
   could be used as resistance biomarkers or targets to reverse tamoxifen
   resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Low steady-state levels of active tamoxifen metabolites have been
   associated with inferior treatment outcomes. In this retrospective
   analysis of 406 estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer (BC) patients
   receiving adjuvant tamoxifen as initial treatment, we have associated
   our previously reported thresholds for the two active metabolites,
   Z-endoxifen and Z-4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (Z-4OHtam), with treatment
   outcomes in an independent cohort of BC patients. Among all patients,
   metabolite levels did not affect survival. However, in the premenopausal
   subgroup receiving tamoxifen alone (n = 191) we confirmed an inferior BC
   -specific survival in patients with the previously described serum
   concentration threshold of Z-4OHtam <= 3.26 nm (HR = 2.37, 95\% CI =
   1.02-5.48, P = 0.039). The `dose-response' survival trend in patients
   categorized to ordinal concentration cut-points of Z-4OHtamoxifen (<=
   3.26, 3.27-8.13, > 8.13 nm) was also replicated (P-trend log-rank =
   0.048). Z-endoxifen was not associated with outcome. This is the first
   study to confirm the association between a published active tamoxifen
   metabolite threshold and BC outcome in an independent patient cohort.
   Premenopausal patients receiving 5-year of tamoxifen alone may benefit
   from therapeutic drug monitoring to ensure tamoxifen effectiveness.}},

Title = {{Understanding how young people become motivated to take their human

   need for adherence is communicated}},
Journal = {{HEALTH SA GESONDHEID}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{25}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Antiretroviral therapy (ART), the only effective treatment
   for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), requires excellent long-term
   compliance. Poor levels of adherence to ART, especially amongst
   adolescents and young adults in South Africa, have been reported.
   Aim: This study aimed to explore how young people become motivated to
   take their HIV medication (ART) and how the need for adherence is
   communicated.
   Setting: The study was conducted in a peri-urban township in the Western
   Cape, South Africa.
   Methods: A qualitative grounded theory approach was employed. Eighty
   young people were purposively recruited. Participant observation, focus
   groups and semi-structured interviews were utilised to explore how
   effective ART adherence messages are in motivating adherence amongst
   young people and how they would like ART adherence to be communicated to
   them. All interviews and focus groups were transcribed and analysed by
   using cross-comparison analysis. Measures to ensure trustworthiness were
   established and ethical considerations were adhered to.
   Results: Young people's adherence motivation was an outcome of
   reconnecting to one or more trusted significant other(s) from within
   their belonging group, who accepted and supported them, which in turn
   affirmed their prior belonging identities of son, daughter, other family
   member or close friend. This facilitated reconnection to their present
   and future hopes, which in turn increased their motivation to live and
   to adhere to treatment.
   Conclusion: The findings highlight the need for the development of more
   effective communication strategies, which facilitate and support young
   people's reconnection to trusted members of their belonging groups, and
   also help belonging group members to accept, affirm and support
   adherence.}},

Abstract = {{Esophageal leiomyomas are common benign tumors. Although surgical
   resection is warranted in symptomatic patients, the procedure used to
   enucleate a giant, circumferential tumor is complicated. A 38-year-old
   man was referred to our institution with a diagnosis of submucosal
   esophageal tumor. An endoscopic examination revealed a protruding
   submucosal mass in the lower third of the esophagus. Computed tomography
   scans demonstrated a circumferential mass measuring 90 x 40 mm.
   Examination of the biopsy specimens resulted in a diagnosis of leiomyoma
   of the esophagus, and thoracoscopic enucleation of the tumor via the
   right thorax with the patient in the prone position was planned.
   Histopathological and immunohistochemical staining of the surgical
   specimen confirmed the preoperative diagnosis of benign leiomyoma. The
   patient was discharged on postoperative day 7 without any complications.}},

Title = {{First-principles calculation of the configurational energy density of
   states for a solid-state ion conductor with a variant of the Wang and
   Landau algorithm}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},

Volume = {{102}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a variant of the Wang and Landau algorithm for calculation
   of the configurational energy density of states is proposed. The
   algorithm was developed for the purpose of using first-principles
   simulations, such as density functional theory, to calculate the
   partition function of disordered sublattices in crystal materials. The
   expensive calculations of first-principles methods make a parallel
   algorithm necessary for a practical computation of the configurational
   energy density of states within a supercell approximation of a
   solid-state material. The algorithm developed in this work is tested
   with the two-dimensional (2d) Ising model to bench mark the algorithm
   and to help provide insight for implementation to a materials science
   application. Tests with the 2d Ising model revealed that the algorithm
   has good performance compared to the original Wang and Landau algorithm
   and the 1/t algorithm, in particular the short iteration performance. A
   proof of convergence is presented within an adiabatic assumption, and
   the analysis is able to correctly predict the time dependence of the
   modification factor to the density of states. The algorithm was then
   applied to the lithium and lanthanum sublattice of the solid-state
   lithium ion conductor Li0.5La0.5TiO3. This was done to help understand
   the disordered nature of the lithium and lanthanum. The results find,
   overall, that the algorithm performs very well for the 2d Ising model
   and that the results for Li0.5La0.5TiO3 are consistent with experiment
   while providing additional insight into the lithium and lanthanum
   ordering in the material. The primary result is that the lithium and
   lanthanum become more mixed between layers along the c axis for
   increasing temperature. In part, the simulation of the disordered
   Li0.5La0.5TiO3 system serves as a benchmark for what size systems are
   currently and in the near future practical to calculate with density
   functional theory methods.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic characterization of wild and cultivated plants provides valuable
   knowledge for conservation and agriculture. DNA sequencing technologies
   are improving, and costs are dropping. Yet analysis of many species is
   hindered because they grow in regions that lack infrastructure for
   advanced molecular biology. The authors developed and adapted low-cost
   methods that address these issues. Tissue was collected and stored in
   silica gel, avoiding the need for liquid nitrogen and freezers. The
   authors optimized low-cost, homemade DNA extraction to increase yields,
   reduce costs and produce DNA suitable for next-generation sequencing.
   The authors describe how to build a gel documentation system for DNA
   quantification. As a proof of principle, the authors used these methods
   to evaluate wild Berberis darwinii, native to Southern Chile.
   METHOD SUMMARY
   The authors describe a suite of low-cost, do-it-yourself methods for
   field collection of plant tissues, extraction of genomic DNA suitable
   for next-generation sequencing and homemade agarose gel documentation

Abstract = {{The ability to create robust microwave absorbing materials renders
   efficient protection of electromagnetic radiation. The combination of
   magnetic and dielectric losses has emerged as an appealing strategy to
   yield high-performance microwave absorbers. In this context,
   dual-shelled hollow nanospheres composed of magnetic Fe3O4 inner shell
   and dielectric TiO2 outer shell (denoted DS-Fe3O4@TiO2-HNs) are, for the
   first time, crafted by rationally introducing a sacrificial intermediate
   shell. Notably, such unique dual-shelled nanostructures with a
   relatively large hollow interior within the Fe3O4 inner shell and an
   additional cavity between the Fe3O4 inner shell and the TiO2 outer shell
   (i.e., dual-cavity) manifest an advantageous attribute for producing
   lightweight absorbers. Intriguingly, the reflection loss (RL) of -60.17
   decibel (dB) at 10 GHz and the effective bandwidth of microwave
   absorption of 10.5 GHz at RL <= -10 dB, representing 90\% absorption,
   are achieved for DS-Fe3O4@TiO2-HNs with a thickness of only 1.8 mm. The
   outstanding microwave absorption performance of DS-Fe3O4@TiO2-HNs can be
   attributed to the synergy of efficient trapping of the incident wave,
   markedly enhanced interfacial polarization, and greatly improved
   impedance matching. As such, judiciously crafted uniform dual-shelled,
   dual-cavity nanospheres possessing optimal magnetic and dielectric
   losses hold great promise as highly efficient lightweight microwave
   absorbers for use in electromagnetic interference shielding, including
   mobile communication devices, AM radio, and radar, among other areas.}},

Abstract = {{Banning the sale of rinse-off cosmetics containing plastic microbeads to
   protect the environment requires understanding the lifetime
   environmental impacts of potential substitutes. By comparing the
   environmental performance of alternatives, this study finds viable
   substitutes and those with adverse effects.
   In our haste to ban or regulate unsustainable and environmentally
   damaging materials and chemicals, we may overlook dangers posed by their
   substitutes. In light of the scientific evidence regarding the fate,
   persistence and toxicity of microplastics in the marine environment,
   many countries have banned the sale of rinse-off cosmetics containing
   plastic microbeads to prevent their release to the environment. However,
   the wider lifetime environmental impacts of the potential substitutes
   have not been considered, and care must be taken so that the
   environmental costs of using them do not potentially outweigh the
   benefits resulting from the bans. In this study, we use life cycle
   assessment to compare the environmental performance of a wide range of
   potential alternatives. The study investigates the quantities of these
   materials required and the human health and environmental impacts of
   their manufacture, transport and inclusion in cosmetics. We highlight
   that the long-term environmental and human health effects of their
   disposal are unknown and are thus excluded from the life cycle
   assessment. In support of the responsible replacement of plastic

Title = {{Geographic distribution of hospice, homecare, and nursing home
   facilities and access to end-of-life care among persons living with
   HIV/AIDS in Appalachia}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},

Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Access to healthcare services, from diagnosis through end of life (EOL),
   is important among persons living with Human Immunodeficiency Syndrome
   (HIV) and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) (PLWHA). However,
   little is known about the availability of hospice services in
   Appalachian areas. Therefore, the objective of this study is to describe
   the geographic distribution of hospice, homecare and nursing home
   facilities in order to demonstrate current existence of and access to
   resources for EOL care among PLWHA in the Appalachian regions of
   Tennessee and Alabama.
   Methods
   This paper reports on the second aim of a larger sequential, mixed
   methods qualitative-quantitative (qual -> quan) study. Data from advance
   care planning (ACP) surveys were collected by both electronic (n = 28)
   and paper copies (n = 201) and, among other things, obtained information
   on zip codes of residence of PLWHA. This enabled assessment of the
   geographic distribution of residences of PLWHA in relation to the
   distribution of healthcare services such as hospice and home healthcare
   services. Hospice and Home Healthcare data were obtained from the
   Tennessee and Alabama Departments of Health. The street addresses of
   these facilities were used to geocode and map the geographic
   distributions of the facilities using Street Map USA. Travel times to
   Hospice and Home Healthcare facilities were computed and mapped using
   ArcGIS 10.3.
   Results
   We identified a total of 32 hospice and 69 home healthcare facilities in
   the Tennessee Appalachian region, while the Alabama Appalachian region
   had a total of 110 hospice and 86 home healthcare facilities. Most care
   facilities were located in urban centers. The distribution of care
   facilities was worse in Tennessee with many counties having no
   facilities, requiring up to an hour drive time to reach patients. A
   total of 86\% of the PLWHA indicated preference to die at home.
   Conclusions
   Persons living with HIV/AIDS in Appalachia face a number of challenges
   at the end of life that make access to EOL services difficult. Although
   respondents indicated a preference to die at home, the hospice/homecare
   infrastructure and resources are overwhelmingly inadequate to meet this
   need. There is need to improve access to EOL care in the Appalachian
   regions of both Tennessee and Alabama although the need is greater in
   Tennessee.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the positron (e(+)) interaction with the hydrogen molecular
   dianion H-2(2-) to form the positronic bound state of {[}H-; e(+); H-]
   using the first-principles quantum Monte Carlo method combined with the
   multi-component molecular orbital one. H-2(2-) itself is unstable, but
   it was shown that such an unbound H-2(2-) may become stable by
   intermediating a positron and forming the positronic covalent bond of
   the {[}H-; e(+); H-] system {[}J. Charry et al., Angew. Chem., Int. Ed.
   57, 8859-8864 (2018)]. We newly found that {[}H-; e(+); H-] has double
   minima containing another positronic bound state of {[}H-2; Ps(-)]-like
   configuration with the positronium negative ion Ps(-) at the bond
   distance approximately equal to the equilibrium H-2 molecule. Our
   multi-component variational Monte Carlo calculation and the
   multi-component configuration interaction one resulted in the positronic
   covalent bonded structure being the global minimum, whereas a more
   sophisticated multi-component diffusion Monte Carlo calculation clearly
   showed that the {[}H-2; Ps(-)]-like structure at the short bond distance
   is energetically more stable than the positronic covalent bonded one.
   The relaxation due to interparticle correlation effects pertinent to
   Ps(-) (or Ps) formation is crucial for the formation of the
   Ps(-)A(2)-like structure for binding a positron to the non-polar
   negatively charged dihydrogen.}},

Title = {{How the Toxin got its Toxicity}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{Venom systems are functional and ecological traits, typically used by
   one organism to subdue or deter another. A predominant subset of their
   constituent molecules-{''}toxins{''}-share this ecological function and
   are therefore molecules that mediate interactions between organisms.
   Such molecules have been referred to as ``exochemicals.{''} There has
   been debate within the field of toxinology concerning the evolutionary
   pathways leading to the ``recruitment{''} of a gene product for a toxic
   role within venom. We review these discussions and the evidence
   interpreted in support of alternate pathways, along with many of the
   most popular models describing the origin of novel molecular functions
   in general. We note that such functions may arise with or without gene
   duplication occurring and are often the consequence of a gene product
   encountering a novel ``environment,{''} i.e., a range of novel partners
   for molecular interaction. After stressing the distinction between
   ``activity{''} and ``function,{''} we describe in detail the results of
   a recent study which reconstructed the evolutionary history of a
   multigene family that has been recruited as a toxin and argue that these
   results indicate that a pluralistic approach to understanding the origin
   of novel functions is advantageous. This leads us to recommend that an
   expansive approach be taken to the definition of
   ``neofunctionalization{''}-simply the origins of a novel molecular
   function by any process-and ``recruitment{''}-the ``weaponization{''} of
   a molecule via the acquisition of a toxic function in venom, by any
   process. Recruitment does not occur at the molecular level or even at
   the level of gene expression, but only when a confluence of factors
   results in the ecological deployment of a physiologically active
   molecule as a toxin. Subsequent to recruitment, the evolutionary regime
   of a gene family may shift into a more dynamic form of
   ``birth-and-death.{''} Thus, recruitment leads to a form of ``downwards
   causation,{''} in which a change at the ecological level at which whole
   organisms interact leads to a change in patterns of evolution at the
   genomic level.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose To add to the existing body of knowledge on the relationship
   between stress and job performance in policing, we monitored police
   officers' physiology using Hexoskin shirts while they responded to
   simulated scenarios. Design/methodology/approach We employed mixed
   repeated measures (baseline, intervention, post-intervention), between
   groups (treatment vs control group) design. Using this approach, our
   aims were (1) to determine whether an individualized physiological
   stress profile-a combination of heart rate (HR), heart rate variability
   (HRV), sympathetic nervous system (SNS) index and parasympathetic
   nervous system (PNS) index-could be developed for each participant; (2)
   to investigate the association between physiological stress and scenario
   performance and (3) to pilot test an intervention for decreasing
   physiological stress in real time. Findings We found that it was
   possible to individualize physiological stress profiles for each
   participant that alerted us when the participant was becoming stressed.
   We also found that physiological stress was significantly and
   negatively/inversely associated with scenario performance. However, our
   intervention to try and decrease participants' stress in real time was
   not successful. Several key lessons can be taken from our attempt that
   could inform future efforts in this area. Research
   limitations/implications This was a small pilot study, precluding
   generalizability of results. Furthermore, our intervention was
   simplistic and potentially affected by an experimenter effect. Future
   research should explore better ways to intervene when officers are
   becoming physiologically stressed to help them overcome stress in real
   time and safeguard against the cumulative effects of stress on health
   and performance. Originality/value This research adds to the body of
   knowledge on physiological stress and job-task performance in police
   officers.}},

Abstract = {{In the optical sky, minutes-duration transients from cosmological
   distances are rare. Known objects that give rise to such transients
   include gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), the most luminous explosions in the
   Universe(1) that have been detected at redshifts as high as z
   approximate to 9.4 (refs. (2-4)). These high-redshift GRBs and their
   associated emission can be used to probe the star formation and
   reionization history in the era of cosmic dawn. Here, we report a
   near-infrared transient with an observed duration shorter than 245 s
   that is coincident with the luminous star-forming galaxy GN-z11 at z
   approximate to 11. The telluric absorption shown in the near-infrared
   spectrum indicates that its origin is above the Earth's atmosphere. We
   can rule out the possibility of known man-made objects or moving objects
   in the Solar System on the basis of the observational information and
   our current understanding of the properties of these objects. As some
   long-duration GRBs are associated with a bright ultraviolet or optical
   flash(5-14), we investigate the possibility that the detected signal
   arose from a rest-frame ultraviolet flash associated with a long GRB
   from GN-z11. Despite the very low probability of being a GRB, we find
   that the spectrum, brightness and duration of the transient are
   consistent with such an interpretation. Our result may suggest that long
   GRBs can be produced as early as 420 million years after the Big Bang.
   A peculiar near-infrared transient with an observed duration shorter
   than 245 s, coincident with the luminous star-forming galaxy GN-z11 at z
   approximate to 11, might have arisen from a rest-frame ultraviolet flash
   associated with a long gamma-ray burst in GN-z11.}},

Abstract = {{To study the dynamic support characteristics of an auto-eliminating

   proposes a parameter identification method based on the finite element

   damping matrices of the ACAB were deduced and the feasibility of
   identifying the support characteristics of the ACAB by the FEM-based
   method were verified in a simulation study. The ACAB support
   characteristics were also determined in an experiment. The unbalance
   response of the rotor was obtained under unbalance excitation, and the
   stiffness and damping values of the ACAB at various rotational speeds of
   the rotor were obtained by the FEM-based parameter identification
   method. Finally, the identification results were verified by comparing
   the theoretical and experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{The demands of modern materials are highly challenging as well as
   partially contradictory. For example, materials should be strong like
   steels but chemically inert like soft low-surface energy polymers. These
   conflicts can be overcome by effectively combining disparate materials
   in composites that allow fusing of the traditional material classes like
   ceramics, polymers, and metals. Such combinations require sufficient
   adhesion between the individual materials. If adhesion is based on
   mechanical interlocking, the chemistry and chemical compatibility of the
   individual materials play a negligible role for the adhesion, but the
   mechanical properties of the materials are exclusively important. This
   work focusses on a technologically relevant example of a
   micro-mechanical interlocking surface structure on grade 304 stainless
   steel (SST) by nanoscale sculpturing. Using a low aggressive/low toxic
   seawater-like and diluted HNO3-based electrolyte, the resulting
   structure is free from preferential grain-boundary etching. The
   sculptured surface is super hydrophilic with undercuts suitable for
   mechanical interlocking with polymers. In single-lap shear tests,
   different two-component adhesives failed cohesively on structured SST
   while showing more than a doubling of the ultimate shear strength
   compared to the state-of-the-art grit-blasted SST composites which only
   showed adhesive failure.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN GENETICS}},

Abstract = {{This study assessed the accuracy and bias of genomic prediction (GP) in
   purebred Holstein (H) and Jersey (J) as well as crossbred (H and J)
   validation cows using different reference sets and prediction
   strategies. The reference sets were made up of different combinations of
   36,695 H and J purebreds and crossbreds. Additionally, the effect of
   using different sets of marker genotypes on GP was studied (conventional
   panel: 50k, custom panel enriched with, or close to, causal mutations:
   XT\_50k, and conventional high-density with a limited custom set: pruned
   HDnGBS). We also compared the use of genomic best linear unbiased
   prediction (GBLUP) and Bayesian (emBayesR) models, and the traits tested
   were milk, fat, and protein yields. On average, by including crossbred
   cows in the reference population, the prediction accuracies increased by
   0.01-0.08 and were less biased (regression coefficient closer to 1 by
   0.02-0.16), and the benefit was greater for crossbreds compared to
   purebreds. The accuracy of prediction increased by 0.02 using XT\_50k
   compared to 50k genotypes without affecting the bias. Although using
   pruned HDnGBS instead of 50k also increased the prediction accuracy by
   about 0.02, it increased the bias for purebred predictions in emBayesR
   models. Generally, emBayesR outperformed GBLUP for prediction accuracy
   when using 50k or pruned HDnGBS genotypes, but the benefits diminished
   with XT\_50k genotypes. Crossbred predictions derived from a joint pure
   H and J reference were similar in accuracy to crossbred predictions
   derived from the two separate purebred reference sets and combined
   proportional to breed composition. However, the latter approach was less
   biased by 0.13. Most interestingly, using an equalized breed reference
   instead of an H-dominated reference, on average, reduced the bias of
   prediction by 0.16-0.19 and increased the accuracy by 0.04 for crossbred
   and J cows, with a little change in the H accuracy. In conclusion, we
   observed improved genomic predictions for both crossbreds and purebreds
   by equalizing breed contributions in a mixed breed reference that
   included crossbred cows. Furthermore, we demonstrate, that compared to
   the conventional 50k or high-density panels, our customized set of 50k
   sequence markers improved or matched the prediction accuracy and reduced
   bias with both GBLUP and Bayesian models.}},

Title = {{The effects of user comment valence of Facebook health messages on
   intention to receive the flu vaccine: the role of pre-existing attitude
   towards the flu vaccine and psychological reactance}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING}},
Abstract = {{This study examined if and how Facebook user-generated comments about
   the flu vaccine influenced psychological reactance in conjunction with
   pre-existing flu vaccine attitude. Psychological reactance was further
   tested as a mediating factor influencing behavioural intention to
   receive the vaccine. An experimental study was conducted with 264
   college students. The results showed that pre-existing attitude
   positively influenced participants' intention to obtain the flu vaccine
   through an increase (a decrease) in psychological reactance when there
   was inconsistency (consistency) between the pre-existing attitude and
   valence of comments. Collectively, the results demonstrate that
   psychological reactance is one possible theoretical mechanism through
   which social media users' health behaviours are influenced by
   user-generated comments.}},

Abstract = {{Samul-tang (SM), a traditional herbal medicine, has been used to treat
   menstrual irregularities and infertility in women. However, the cellular
   and molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of SM remain elusive. We
   investigated the potential protective effect of SM against chronic
   ovarian dysfunction and used bioinformatics analysis to identify its
   underlying mechanism in a mouse model of cyclophosphamide (CP)-induced
   diminished ovarian reserve. Female C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally
   injected with CP three times a week, followed by oral administration of
   distilled water (CP group) or SM (CP+SM group) for 4 weeks. Four weeks
   later, the effect of SM was assessed by ovarian tissue histological
   analysis, steroid hormone measurement, oocyte quality, and mRNA and
   microRNA microarray analysis in the ovaries. Although SM administration
   did not prevent CP-induced follicle loss in mice, the quality of oocytes
   was better in CP+SM mice than in CP mice. Gene expression analysis
   revealed that the expression of fertilisation- and ovarian follicle
   development-related genes was altered by CP treatment but normalized
   after SM administration. Further bioinformatics analysis showed possible
   interactions between differentially expressed mRNAs and microRNAs.
   Therefore, we demonstrated the protective effects of SM on ovarian
   function and oocyte maturation against CP-induced damage via multiple
   epigenetic mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work is the investigation of the indirect reduction of
   hematite in fluidized beds and the effects of different kinetic
   parameters on the reduction process at a numerical level, which are
   validated against experimental results. We utilize a CFD-DEM coupling
   method, where gas phase is represented by classic CFD and iron ores by
   DEM. Both phases are strongly coupled by heat and mass transfer. The
   particle reduction is modeled using unreacted shrinking core model
   taking into account the morphological changes of the ore. The model is
   validated and critical reaction parameters such as the activation
   energies, pre-exponenital factors and equilibrium constants are
   investigated. It sheds light on how much an influence the kinetic
   parameters have on the reduction degree and becomes evident that the
   rate determining step is reduction from wustite to iron. The model is
   then applied to a lab-scale fluidized bed reactor. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Title = {{Protective effect of benfotiamine on methotrexate induced gastric damage
   in rats}},
Journal = {{BIOTECHNIC \& HISTOCHEMISTRY}},
Abstract = {{Methotrexate (MTX) is widely used for treating cancers and inflammatory
   diseases; it is a potential anti-metabolite and folate antagonist. We
   investigated potential protective effects of benfotiamine on MTX damage.
   We used a rat model of MTX induced gastric injury to assess changes in
   gastric histopathology, oxidative stress and visfatin levels due to MTX
   treatment. Rats were divided into four groups: an untreated control
   group, an MTX group treated with a single dose of MTX, a benfotiamine
   group treated with benfotiamine daily for two weeks, and a benfotiamine
   + MTX group treated with a single dose of MTX followed by benfotiamine
   daily for two weeks. Total serum antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant
   status (TOS) and visfatin levels were measured at the end of the
   experiment. At the end of the experiment, we investigated both visfatin
   expression and the histopathology of gastric tissues. The mean visfatin
   level was lower in the MTX group than in the benfotiamine group. The
   mean serum TOS levels were higher in MTX group than in the control,
   benfotiamine or benfotiamine + MTX groups. Significant gastric gland
   dilation, and erosion and loss of mucosa were found on the gastric
   surface in the MTX group compared to the control group. The dilation,
   erosion and mucosal loss were decreased significantly in the
   benfotiamine + MTX group compared to the MTX group. Compared to the
   control group, visfatin immunoreactivity was reduced significantly in
   the MTX group. Decreased visfatin levels appear to play a role in the
   mechanism of gastric damage. Benfotiamine may be useful for preventing
   MTX induced gastric injuries.}},

Title = {{Reaction of (GaClPc)-Cl-III, (SnCl2TPP)-Cl-IV and B(III)ClSubPc with
   cyanide anions: reduction of macrocycles vs. formation of

Journal = {{DALTON TRANSACTIONS}},

Abstract = {{The reaction of (GaClPc)-Cl-III, (SnCl2TPP)-Cl-IV and B(III)ClSubPc
   containing phthalocyanine (Pc), tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) and
   subphthalocyanine (SubPc) macrocycles with cyanide in the presence of
   cryptand{[}2.2.2] under anaerobic conditions yields crystalline salts in
   which cyano anions substitute chloride anions at Ga-III, Sn-IV or B-III,
   as well as reducing the macrocycles or adding one or two CN- to them.
   The reaction of (GaCl)-Cl-III(Pc2-) with CN- yields
   \{crypt(K+)\}\{(GaCN)-C-III(Pc3-)\}(-)center dot 0.5C(6)H(4)Cl(2) (1) in
   which the Pc2- macrocycle is reduced to Pc3-. Such reduction could
   probably occur through the addition of CN- to Pc2- forming
   \{Ga-III(CN){[}Pc(CN)](3-)\}(-) which can decompose further interacting
   with an excess of CN-. As a result, Pc3- and cyanogene anions are
   formed. The interaction of (SnCl2)-Cl-IV(TPP2-) with CN- is accompanied
   by the addition of CN- to the meso-carbon atom of porphyrin forming
   diamagnetic TPP(CN)(3-) macrocycles in
   \{crypt(K+)\}\{Sn-IV(CN)(2){[}TPP(CN)](3-)\}(-) (2). Salt 2 shows a
   strong NIR absorption band with the maximum at 854 nm whose intensity is
   comparable with that of the Soret band. The interaction of
   (BCl)-Cl-III(SubPc(2-)) with three equivalents of CN- is accompanied by
   the addition of two CN- to carbon atoms of SubPc(2-) closest to
   meso-nitrogen atoms forming \{B-III(CN){[}SubPc(CN)(2)](4-)\}(2-). Most
   probably these dianions transfer electrons to C6H4Cl2 producing the
   \{B-III(CN){[}SubPc(CN)(2)](3-)\}(-) radical anions which form
   sigma-bonded diamagnetic dianions in
   \{crypt(K+)\}(2)\{B-III(CN){[}SubPc(CN)(2)]\}(2)(2-)center dot
   3C(6)H(4)Cl(2) (3). The remaining carbon atom closest to the
   meso-nitrogen atom is involved in this dimerization. According to the
   calculations, the energy of the C-CN bond is minimal for
   \{Ga-III(CN){[}Pc(CN)](3-)\}(-) enabling further transformation of these
   anions to \{(GaCN)-C-III(Pc3-)\}(-) in 1, whereas cyano-containing
   anions in 2 and 3 with higher energy of this bond are stable towards the
   elimination of CN. Optical and magnetic properties of 1-3 together with
   their crystal and molecular structures are presented. The possible ways
   of the formation of 1-3 are discussed based on DFT calculations.}},

Abstract = {{Globular amorphous carbonaceous materials embedded with graphite
   encapsulated metallic Co-nanoparticles with a high degree of
   crystallinity are synthesized by pyrolysis and demonstrated as excellent
   candidates for optical limiters. The amount of metal precursor
   (Co-acetylacetonate) used with toluene for pyrolysis is chosen as a
   strategy to control the degree of graphitization of graphene-like shells
   around the embedded Co-nanoparticles and also the crystallinity of these
   Co nanoparticles in the samples. The graphitic shell with an optimum
   amount of defects tunes the electronic properties of these
   nanomaterials, providing the electronic states required for the
   enhancement of nonlinear optical absorption (NLA) through an excited
   state absorption (ESA) process. Simultaneously, the increase in the
   crystallinity of the Co nanoparticle enhances its metallic nature, which
   helps in increasing NLA performance through the free carrier absorption
   (FCA) process. The importance of highly metallic Co is to involve both
   the Co nanoparticle and its graphitic encapsulation in facilitating the
   FCA process, which substantially enhances NLA. In comparison with many
   similar samples (e.g., Fe3C@C at 100 mu J of laser energy), our present
   samples show superior NLA performance even at the much lower laser pulse
   energy of similar to 15 mu J. This performance is much better than many
   of the present-day NLA materials too. The simple, low-cost and one-step
   pyrolysis synthesis process makes our materials even more attractive.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{153}},

Abstract = {{Two-photon excitation (TPE) is an attractive means for controlling
   chemistry in both space and time. Since isoenergetic one- and two-photon
   excitations (OPE and TPE) in non-centrosymmetric molecules are allowed
   to reach the same excited state, it is usually assumed that they produce
   similar excited-state reactivity. We compare the solvent-to-solute
   excited-state proton transfer of the super photobase FR0-SB following
   isoenergetic OPE and TPE. We find up to 62\% increased reactivity
   following TPE compared to OPE. From steady-state spectroscopy, we rule
   out the involvement of different excited states and find that OPE and
   TPE spectra are identical in non-polar solvents but not in polar ones.
   We propose that differences in the matrix elements that contribute to
   the two-photon absorption cross sections lead to the observed enhanced
   isoenergetic reactivity, consistent with the predictions of our
   high-level coupled-cluster-based computational protocol. We find that
   polar solvent configurations favor greater dipole moment change between
   ground and excited states, which enters the probability for TPE as the
   absolute value squared. This, in turn, causes a difference in the
   Franck-Condon region reached via TPE compared to OPE. We conclude that a
   new method has been found for controlling chemical reactivity via the
   matrix elements that affect two-photon cross sections, which may be of
   great utility for spatial and temporal precision chemistry.}},

Title = {{Attention-Based Recurrent Neural Network for Plant Disease
   Classification}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{Plant diseases have a significant impact on global food security and the
   world's agricultural economy. Their early detection and classification
   increase the chances of setting up effective control measures, which is
   why the search for automatic systems that allow this is of major
   interest to our society. Several recent studies have reported promising
   results in the classification of plant diseases from RGB images on the
   basis of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). These studies have been
   successfully experimented on a large number of crops and symptoms, and
   they have shown significant advantages in the support of human
   expertise. However, the CNN models still have limitations. In
   particular, CNN models do not necessarily focus on the visible parts
   affected by a plant disease to allow their classification, and they can
   sometimes take into account irrelevant backgrounds or healthy plant
   parts. In this paper, we therefore develop a new technique based on a
   Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to automatically locate infected regions
   and extract relevant features for disease classification. We show
   experimentally that our RNN-based approach is more robust and has a
   greater ability to generalize to unseen infected crop species as well as
   to different plant disease domain images compared to classical CNN
   approaches. We also analyze the focus of attention as learned by our RNN
   and show that our approach is capable of accurately locating infectious
   diseases in plants. Our approach, which has been tested on a large
   number of plant species, should thus contribute to the development of
   more effective means of detecting and classifying crop pathogens in the
   near future.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   Intrahepatic cholestasis in pregnancy (ICP) is the most common liver
   disease during pregnancy, and its exact etiology and course of
   progression are still poorly understood.
   AIM
   To investigate the link between the gut microbiota and serum metabolome
   in ICP patients.
   METHODS
   In this study, a total of 30 patients were recruited, including 15
   patients with ICP (disease group) and 15 healthy pregnant patients
   (healthy group). The serum nontarget metabolomes from both groups were
   determined. Amplification of the 16S rRNA V3-V4 region was performed
   using fecal samples from the disease and healthy groups. By comparing
   the differences in the microbiota and metabolite compositions between
   the two groups, the relationship between the gut microbiota and serum
   metabolites was also investigated.
   RESULTS
   The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis results showed that
   the primary bile acid biosynthesis, bile secretion and taurine and
   hypotaurine metabolism pathways were enriched in the ICP patients
   compared with the healthy controls. In addition, some pathways related
   to protein metabolism were also enriched in the ICP patients. The
   principal coordination analysis results showed that there was a distinct
   difference in the gut microbiota composition (beta diversity) between
   the ICP patients and healthy controls. At the phylum level, we observed
   that the relative abundance of Firmicutes was higher in the healthy
   group, while Bacteroidetes were enriched in the disease group. At the
   genus level, most of the bacteria depleted in ICP are able to produce
   short-chain fatty acids (e.g., Faecalibacterium, Blautia and Eubacterium
   hallii), while the bacteria enriched in ICP are associated with bile
   acid metabolism (e.g., Parabacteroides and Bilophila). Our results also
   showed that specific genera were associated with the serum metabolome.
   CONCLUSION
   Our study showed that the serum metabolome was altered in ICP patients
   compared to healthy controls, with significant differences in the bile,
   taurine and hypotaurine metabolite pathways. Alterations in the
   metabolization of these pathways may lead to disturbances in the gut
   microbiota, which may further affect the course of progression of ICP.}},

   for Optimizing Vehicle Group Lane-Changing Behaviors}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{The traffic congestion in ramp areas is becoming increasingly prominent.
   In the upstream segments of ramp areas, effective management and control
   of lane-changing behaviors can improve the road capacity and make full
   use of the existing road resource. With the continuous development and
   application of connected vehicle technologies, lane-changing behaviors
   can be performed by vehicle groups. Under a connected vehicle
   environment, the lane-changing behaviors by vehicle groups are
   controlled in the upstream segment in a ramp area, and the lane-changing
   behaviors can be completed prior to entering the ramp area. Finally,
   lane-changing strategies are optimized and identified. VISSIM simulates
   these proposed strategies. This paper considers the delay as the output
   index for analyzing and comparing various strategies. The results
   demonstrate that the delays of different lane-changing strategies are
   also different. If the delays of ramp areas are to be substantially
   reduced, it is necessary to continuously optimize the lane-changing
   strategies by vehicle groups in the upstream segments. This optimization
   of lane-changing strategies will effectively regulate drivers'
   lane-changing behaviors, improve road safety, and increase traffic
   capacity.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a genetic programming method for satellite system design
   is proposed to simultaneously optimize the topology and parameters of a
   satellite system. Firstly, the representation of satellite system design
   is defined according to the tree structure. The genetic programming
   method is designed based on that representation. Secondly, according to
   the tree structure of different satellite schemes, different multiscale
   satellite models are established, in which various physical fields
   couple together. Then, an evaluation system is also proposed to test the
   performances of different satellite schemes. Finally, the application to
   the design of an earth observation satellite demonstrates the
   effectiveness of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Deploying the cloud energy storage system (CESS) is an economic and
   efficient way to store excess photovoltaic generation and participate in
   demand response without personal investment on pricy energy storage
   equipment. It is a shared battery energy storage system (BESS) for local
   residential and small commercial consumers, which is designed and
   controlled by the CESS operator. Based on the profit purpose, the CESS
   operator not only pursues the most economic operating strategy, but also
   tries to minimize the total investment on the design stage. This paper
   considers the investment on the batteries, power conversion system,
   reactive power compensation equipment and the cost including battery
   degradation cost and operation cost. The electricity price uncertainty
   and the voltage deviation of the CESS node caused by power exchange are
   also considered. Moreover, the cases of a largely centralized energy
   storage system and multiple distributed energy storage systems are all
   modelled. Finally, an original robust cooptimization model is
   transferred to a mixed integer linear programming model (MILP) and
   solved in GAMS. Numerical results based on historical data from 300
   residential consumers in Australia present that the battery degradation
   cost and price uncertainty can't be neglected.}},

Abstract = {{A mitochondrial pH sensing fluorescent probe namely
   2-(2-(6-hydroxynaphthalen-2-yl)vinyl)-3-(6-(triphenyl-phosphonio)hexyl)b
   enzothiazol-3-ium bromide (HTBT2) was designed and facilely synthesized
   via the Knoevenagel condensation reaction. HTBT2 displayed a linear
   fluorescence enhancement at 612 nm in response to pH changes between
   8.70 and 7.20. The pK(a) value was determined to be 8.04 +/- 0.02, which
   might be ideal for mitochondrial pH (pH(mito) similar to 8.0) detection.
   HTBT2 also exhibited a remarkable large Stokes shift of 176 nm, which
   could diminish the interference of excitation light. The results of live
   cell imaging studies suggested that HTBT2 showed excellent targeting
   ability for mitochondria. Importantly, it was successfully applied to
   visualize mitochondrial pH changes in live cells and differentiate the
   pH(mito) difference between cancer cell lines and normal cell lines. Our
   results consistently supported that HTBT2 held practical promise for the
   investigation of physiological processes related to pHmito changes and
   clinical potential for cancer cell differentiation.}},

Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{The mechanism of reaction-diffusion (RD) processes has great scientific
   and practical importance in many fields. However, theoretical studies of
   RD systems is limited by their multiscale and non-equilibrium nature. In
   this work, we propose an RD model on the basis of the classical density
   functional theory (CDFT) and reaction-diffusion equation (RDE), and
   applied it to an electrode system as an example. The model shows both
   long- and short-range behaviors in the RD system, which are different
   from the corresponding equilibrium systems. A gamma-shaped polarization
   curve consistent with experimental data is predicted. The model also
   indicates that the microscopic/mesoscopic RD process is correlated with
   macroscopic convection through the width of the diffusion region. (C)

Abstract = {{The article examines family socioeconomic determinants that stimulate
   students' demand for private supplementary tutoring in English in urban
   and rural areas. It identifies the scale disparities of tutoring demand
   factors between urban and rural settings. Usually private supplementary
   tutoring is called shadow education that parallels mainstream school
   education before or after school hours on extra fee basis. This study
   found in a 2014-2015 survey that 84.7\% urban and 60.7\% rural secondary
   students received private supplementary tutoring in English. The
   research employed an explanatory sequential mixed method design
   including quantitative and qualitative data collected from a survey and
   individual interview. In spite of emergence of tutoring demand, a few
   students could not be capable to receive private English tutoring.
   Family socioeconomic standpoints shake forms of students' claims for
   learning through tutoring. The study draws on Bourdieu's theory of
   capital, which is then linked with family ability for children's

Abstract = {{Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) allows distinguishing between

   Recent studies demonstrated that this technique has several areas of

   areas can represent either hemorrhage or contrast staining due to
   blood-brain barrier disruption, which can be differentiated reliably by
   DECT. Further applications are improved visualization of early
   infarctions, compared to single-energy computed tomography, and
   prediction of transformation into infarction or hemorrhage in
   contrast-enhancing areas. In addition, DECT allows detection and
   evaluation of the material composition of intra-arterial clots after
   EST. This review summarizes the clinical state-of-the-art of DECT in
   patients with stroke, and features some prospects for future

Abstract = {{Geometric perturbation away from classical structures can engender
   unusual frontier MO situations leading to high Lewis acidity. Recently
   we reported a T-shaped bismuth triamide, which exhibited planar Lewis
   acidity that was unprecedented for neutral group 15 compounds. We now
   report a comprehensive computational assessment of the origins of planar
   Lewis acidity in such compounds. We subsequently use several metrics
   such as MO energies, the Global Electrophilicity Index, ligand
   coordination strengths, and fluoride ion affinity to show that
   electronic variation can be combined with the unusual geometry at
   bismuth to achieve fine-tuning of Lewis acid strength. Our calculations
   reveal for the first time a surprisingly high electrophilicity,
   comparable to or exceeding that of polyfluorinated triarylboranes, as
   well as high rigidity at neutral planar bismuth triamides. These results
   foreshadow the potentially broad applications of a hitherto unexplored
   class of compounds, planar bismuthanes, in contexts that are currently
   dominated by Lewis acidic triarylboranes.}},

   Causes a Fatal ALS-Like Syndrome}},

Abstract = {{Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal heterogeneous
   neurodegenerative disease that causes motor neuron (MN) loss and
   skeletal muscle paralysis. It is uncertain whether this degeneration of
   MNs is triggered intrinsically and is autonomous, or if the disease
   initiating mechanisms are extrinsic to MNs. We hypothesized that
   skeletal muscle is a primary site of pathogenesis in ALS that triggers
   MN degeneration. Some inherited forms of ALS are caused by mutations in
   the superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) gene, that encodes an antioxidant
   protein, so we created transgenic (tg) mice expressing wild-type-,
   G37R-, and G93A-human SOD1 gene variants only in skeletal muscle.
   Presence of human SOD1 (hSOD1) protein in skeletal muscle was verified
   by western blotting, enzyme activity gels, and immunofluorescence in
   myofibers and satellite cells. These tg mice developed limb weakness and
   paresis with motor deficits, limb and chest muscle wasting, diaphragm
   atrophy, and age-related fatal disease with a lifespan shortening of
   10-16\%. Brown and white adipose tissue also became wasted. Myofibers of
   tg mice developed crystalline-like inclusions, individualized sarcomere
   destruction, mitochondriopathy with vesiculation, DNA damage, and
   activated p53. Satellite cells became apoptotic. The diaphragm developed
   severe loss of neuromuscular junction presynaptic and postsynaptic
   integrity, including decreased innervation, loss of synaptophysin,
   nitration of synaptophysin, and loss of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor
   and scaffold protein rapsyn. Co-immunoprecipitation identified hSOD1
   interaction with rapsyn. Spinal cords of tg mice developed gross
   atrophy. Spinal MNs formed cytoplasmic and nuclear inclusions,
   axonopathy, mitochondriopathy, accumulated DNA damage, activated p53 and
   cleaved caspase-3, and died. Tg mice had a 40-50\% loss of MNs. This
   work shows that hSOD1 in skeletal muscle is a driver of pathogenesis in
   ALS, that involves myofiber and satellite cell toxicity, and apparent
   muscle-adipose tissue disease relationships. It also identifies a
   non-autonomous mechanism for MN degeneration explaining their selective
   vulnerability as likely a form of target-deprivation retrograde
   neurodegeneration.}},

Abstract = {{All-perovskite multi-junction photovoltaics, comprised of a wide-bandgap
   (WBG) and a low-bandgap (LBG) perovskite solar cell (PSC), has opened a
   new window to cost-effective yet highly efficient solar cells (>33\%).
   However, the poor operational stability of LBG PSCs is a major obstacle
   to the technological advance of all-perovskite tandem solar cells
   (all-PTSC). This study demonstrates that introducing minute quantities
   of Cs (1-10\%) into the LBG FA(0.8)MA(0.2)Sn(0.5)Pb(0.5)I(3) perovskite
   semiconductors (E-g = 1.26 eV) significantly improves the operational
   photo-stability of the corresponding LBG PSCs, due to a reduction of
   residual nanosized SnyPb(1-y)I2 aggregates, resulting in a beneficial
   stoichiometric composition. For an optimal concentration of Cs (2.5\%)
   in the investigated range, the LBG PSCs attain remarkable power
   conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 18.2\% and maintain up to 92\% of
   their initial power output after two hours under simulated one sun
   illumination. By mechanically stacking high-performance LBG bottom PSCs
   with semi-transparent top PSCs (E-g = 1.65 eV), four-terminal all-PTSCs
   with high PCE of 23.6\% are attainable.}},

Abstract = {{Additive manufacturing (AM) emerged, in the last decades, as a promising
   manufacturing technique for the low-cost fabrication of personalised 3D
   objects. Recently, this technology has been increasingly utilised, both
   in everyday life and in industry. Among the numerous AM techniques
   available, light-triggered AM allows for great shape resolution and a
   smooth surface, while being a relatively fast process. The increasing
   interest given to AM naturally motivated the development of novel 3D
   printable materials in order to keep on widening the possibilities of
   the techniques. Herein, we present an overview of the materials having
   been recently reported in the field, for which the incorporation of
   hierarchical ordering was essential to access novel functionalities and
   properties. In particular, hybrid materials such as fibreand
   nanocrystal-reinforced polymeric networks, liquid crystalline materials
   and metal-organic framework embedded printable materials along with
   their future prospects will be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Background The prevention of metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a major public
   health concern in Japan. The effects of the relationship between eating
   behavior and nutritional intake on MetS remained unclear. To evaluate
   nutrition's role in preventing or exacerbating MetS, we examined the
   associations among eating behavior, nutritional intake, and MetS for the
   baseline study in the cohort subjects undergone health checkups. Methods
   Four thousand and four hundred forty-seven Japanese men and women were
   enrolled at the Saku Central Hospital. They received an anthropometric
   and clinical examination and were assessed for present illness,
   lifestyle factors such as physical activity, smoking, drinking, and
   dietary habits at the enrollment. Eating behavior was analyzed by the
   Sakata's Eating Behavior Questionnaire. Dietary assessment was made
   using a brief self-administered diet history questionnaire. Two thousand
   and six hundred two men and 1844 women aged more than 20 were analyzed.
   Results The mean age in men and women were 59.2 and 58.4 years old and
   the mean body mass index (BMI) were 23.7 and 22.3 kg/m(2), respectively.
   The percentages of MetS were 20.6 in men and 6.1 in women. In some
   nutrients, significantly higher energy-adjusted intakes in subjects
   without MetS than with Mets appeared both in men and women after age
   adjustment. After adjusting by age, energy-adjusted intake beverages in
   men and cereals in women were significantly higher in subjects with MetS
   than those without MetS. The scores of all the categories in eating
   behavior were significantly worse in subjects with MetS than those
   without MetS. Conclusions The differences in dietary intake between
   subjects with Mets and without Mets were relatively small. The scores of
   all the categories in eating behavior were worse in subjects with MetS
   than without MetS. It was suggested that the problem lay in the quality
   of diet, not in the quantity, caused by bad eating habits. The potential
   influence of eating behavior and nutritional intake on MetS was
   presented in men and women.}},

Abstract = {{The surface plasmon response of a cross-sectional segment of a wrinkled
   gold film is studied using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS).
   EELS data demonstrate that wrinkled gold structures act as a suitable
   substrate for surface plasmons to propagate. The intense surface
   variations in these structures facilitate the resonance of a wide range
   of surface plasmons, leading to the broadband surface plasmon response
   of these geometries from the near-infrared to visible wavelengths. The
   metallic nanoparticle boundary element method toolbox is used to
   simulate plasmon eigenmodes in these structures. Eigenmode simulations
   show how the diverse morphology of the wrinkled structure leads to its
   high spectral complexity. Micron-sized structural features that do not
   provide interactions between segments of the wrinkle have only a small
   effect on the surface plasmon resonance response, whereas nanofeatures
   strongly affect the resonant modes of the geometry. According to
   eigenmode calculations, different eigenenergy shifts around the sharp
   folds contribute to the broadband response and infrared activity of
   these structures; these geometrical features also support higher energy
   (shorter wavelength) symmetric and anti-symmetric plasmon coupling
   across the two sides of the folds. It is also shown that additional
   plasmon eigenstates are introduced from hybridization of modes across
   nanogaps between structural features in close proximity to each other.
   All of these factors contribute to the broadband response of the
   wrinkled gold structures.}},

Abstract = {{High T-c superconductors show a rich variety of phases associated with
   their charge degrees of freedom. Valence charges can give rise to charge
   ordering or acoustic plasmons in these layered cuprate superconductors.
   While charge ordering has been observed for both hole- and
   electron-doped cuprates, acoustic plasmons have only been found in
   electron-doped materials. Here, we use resonant inelastic x-ray
   scattering to observe the presence of acoustic plasmons in two families
   of hole-doped cuprate superconductors (La1.84Sr0.16CuO4 and
   Bi2Sr1.6La0.4CuO6+delta), crucially completing the picture.
   Interestingly, in contrast to the quasistatic charge ordering which
   manifests at both Cu and 0 sites, the observed acoustic plasmons are
   predominantly associated with the 0 sites, revealing a unique dichotomy
   in the behavior of valence charges in hole-doped cuprates.}},

Abstract = {{Wound healing is a high energy demanding process that needs a good
   coordination of the mitochondria with glycolysis in the characteristic
   highly hypoxic environment. In diabetes, hyperglycemia impairs the
   adaptive responses to hypoxia with profound negative effects on
   different cellular compartments of wound healing. miR-210 is a
   hypoxia-induced microRNA that regulates cellular metabolism and
   processes important for wound healing. Here, we show that hyperglycemia
   blunted the hypoxia-dependent induction of miR-210 both in vitro and in
   human and mouse diabetic wounds. The impaired regulation of miR-210 in
   diabetic wounds is pathogenic, since local miR-210 administration
   accelerated wound healing specifically in diabetic but not in
   non-diabetic mice. miR-210 reconstitution restores the metabolic balance
   in diabetic wounds by reducing oxygen consumption rate and ROS
   production and by activating glycolysis with positive consequences on
   cellular migration. In conclusion, miR-210 accelerates wound healing
   specifically in diabetes through improvement of the cellular metabolism.}},

Abstract = {{Naphthalenediimide (NDI) based copolymers have been widely used as
   n-type materials in organic field-effect transistors and organic solar
   cells due to their good electron-accepting abilities and high electron
   mobilities. However, electron transport mechanisms for these copolymers
   remain elusive. In particular, whether intra-chain or inter-chain
   electron transfer controls the transport performance is debated. Here,
   we have investigated the intra-chain conformations, inter-chain stacking
   structures, and electron transport properties in a series of NDI based
   copolymers using oligothiophenes (OT) as donors by means of multiscale
   theoretical simulations. The results indicate that these copolymers
   exhibit large twists between the NDI and OT units and tortuous backbone
   conformations, causing the intra-chain electron transfer to be dominated
   by the super-exchange (SE) couplings between adjacent NDI units with
   taking the in-between OT unit as a bridge. Also, the twisted intra-chain
   geometries prevent long-range ordered inter-chain packing. Consequently,
   neither intra-chain nor inter-chain electron transfer can individually
   form a continuous transport network. However, NDI units have plenty of
   inter-chain short contacts and the combination of intra-chain and
   inter-chain couplings results in a robust percolation network for
   efficient electron transport. In addition, the electron mobility can be
   improved by balancing the intra-chain SE couplings and inter-chain
   direct couplings with an appropriate donor length.}},

Abstract = {{After a general introduction to the features and mechanisms of
   cytochrome c oxidases (CcOs) in mitochondria and aerobic bacteria, we
   present DFT calculated physical and spectroscopic properties for the
   catalytic reaction cycle compared with experimental observations in
   bacterial ba(3) type CcO, also with comparisons/contrasts to aa(3) type
   CcOs. The Dinuclear Complex (DNC) is the active catalytic reaction
   center, containing a heme a(3) Fe center and a near lying Cu center
   (called Cu-B) where by successive reduction and protonation, molecular
   O-2 is transformed to two H2O molecules, and protons are pumped from an
   inner region across the membrane to an outer region by transit through
   the CcO integral membrane protein. Structures, energies and vibrational
   frequencies for Fe-O and O-O modes are calculated by DFT over the
   catalytic cycle. The calculated DFT frequencies in the DNC of CcO are
   compared with measured frequencies from Resonance Raman spectroscopy to
   clarify the composition, geometry, and electronic structures of
   different intermediates through the reaction cycle, and to trace
   reaction pathways. X-ray structures of the resting oxidized state are
   analyzed with reference to the known experimental reaction chemistry and
   using DFT calculated structures in fitting observed electron density
   maps. Our calculations lead to a new proposed reaction pathway for
   coupling the P-R -> F -> O-H (ferryl-oxo -> ferric-hydroxo) pathway to
   proton pumping by a water shift mechanism. Through this arc of the
   catalytic cycle, major shifts in pK(a)'s of the special tyrosine and a
   histidine near the upper water pool activate proton transfer. Additional
   mechanisms for proton pumping are explored, and the role of the Cu-B(+)
   (cuprous state) in controlling access to the dinuclear reaction site is
   proposed.}},

Abstract = {{This study was aimed to investigate the effect of feed supplemented with
   betaine on broiler chickens' growth and slaughter performance, breast
   muscle histomorphometric and physicochemical properties, oxidative
   status and amino acid content. A total of 1000 1-day-old Ross 308
   broiler chickens were divided into four treatments. Control group
   chickens were fed with standard compound diet (SCD), the chickens from
   experimental groups B1, B2 and B3 receiving SCD supplemented with 1 g/kg
   (B1), 2 g/kg (B2) and 3 g/kg (B3) betaine anhydrous, respectively. Each
   treatment had five replicate pens. Feeding test results showed that
   betaine reduced broilers' mortality but increased feed conversion ratio
   (p < .05). Forty broiler chickens (5 weeks old) were slaughtered and
   slaughter performance showed that 2 g/kg betaine inclusion improved
   breast muscle percentage and yield (p < .05). Betaine dosage of 1 g/kg
   into feed increased breast muscle fibre areas (p < .05). Betaine
   affected some physicochemical properties: higher a{*} and the highest
   drip loss in B2; the highest cooking losses in B1, B2; the highest shear
   force and fat content in SCD; the highest amounts of ashes in B1, B2 (p
   < .05). Lower malondialdehyde levels were observed in all
   betaine-treated groups (p < .05), except B1 fresh meat samples. The
   highest total amino acid content and a greater amount of essential amino
   acids were obtained in SCD breast muscles (p < .05), except equally
   highest amounts of methionine were found in both SCD and B3 samples (p <
   .05). However, according to our study results, betaine, as a methyl
   group donor, in broiler chicken diets cannot replace methionine as an
   essential amino acid.}},

Abstract = {{South African native chicken breeds are no exception to the declining of
   local domestic breeds that has long been recognised and found associated
   with the commercialisation of breeding in domestic animals. The aims of
   the study were: (i) to provide a comprehensive view of genetic variation
   in four KwaZulu-Natal indigenous chicken populations (Jozini, Newcastle,
   Pietermaritzburg, and Port Shepstone), and (ii) to estimate the extent
   of differentiation of the village populations from three conserved South
   African indigenous pure breeds (Potchefstroom koekoek, Ovambo, and
   Venda) by genotyping individuals at 19 autosomal microsatellite loci.
   Finally, (iii) new information to the history of KwaZulu-Natal
   indigenous chicken populations was made available by exploring their
   phylogenetic relationship and their possible maternal origin through the
   mitochondrial DNA. The results suggested noticeable genetic diversity
   within and between ecotypes with clear sub-structuring between them. The
   indigenous populations had high genetic diversity (observed
   heterozygosity ranging from 0.61 in Pietermaritzburg to 0.70 in Jozini)
   while conserved populations showed considerable within population
   inbreeding coefficient (from 0.01 in Potchefstroom koekoek to 0.18 in
   Ovambo). Median-joining network analyses indicated the dominance of
   haplogroup E suggesting a likely Southeast Asia and/or Indian
   subcontinent origin. The presence of haplogroup B and C not only
   emphasises multiple maternal origin but also highlights genetic
   introgression of local chickens with commercial genotypes. These results
   highlighted the importance of local breeds as a genetic reservoir;
   moreover, the conservation of local breeds may play an important role in
   the local economy as a source of high-quality products for consumers.}},

Abstract = {{Aim In the present study, we investigated the relationship between the
   expressions of two cancer testis antigens (CTA), LY6K (lymphocyte
   antigen 6 complex locus K) and CDCA1 (cell division cycle associated 1),
   in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tumors and the long-term
   outcomes of patients with ESCC to clarify the clinical significance of
   LY6K and CDCA1 expression in ESCC tumors.
   Methods A total of 175 patients with thoracic ESCC who had undergone a
   thoracic esophagectomy with three-field lymphadenectomy without
   neoadjuvant therapy were retrospectively reviewed in this study. LY6K
   and CDCA1 expressions were evaluated in tumor tissues using
   immunohistochemical (IH) staining.
   Results Median patient age was 63 years; 159 patients (90.9\%) were men.
   Ninety-four patients (55.3\%) were LY6K-positive, and 85 patients
   (48.6\%) were CDCA1-positive. The LY6K-positive group had a
   significantly worse overall survival (OS) than the LY6K-negative group
   (P = 0.012), and the CDCA1-positive group had a significantly worse OS
   than the CDCA1-negative group (P = 0.010). A multivariate analysis
   suggested that pathological N stage, venous invasion, LK6Y-positive and
   CDCA1-positive were independent prognostic factors. The patients were
   classified into four groups according to the staining pattern
   combinations of the two CTA. The LY6K-positive and CDCA1-positive group
   was found to have a significantly poorer outcome than the other groups.
   Conclusion ESCC patients with a combination of LY6K and CDCA1 expression
   in their tumor tissues had a worse prognosis than all the other ESCC
   patients and it was an independent factor associated with prognosis for
   patients with ESCC.}},

Title = {{Cortical Thickness Estimation in Individuals With Cerebral Small Vessel
   Disease, Focal Atrophy, and Chronic Stroke Lesions}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Regional changes to cortical thickness in individuals with
   neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) can be estimated
   using specialized neuroimaging software. However, the presence of
   cerebral small vessel disease, focal atrophy, and cortico-subcortical
   stroke lesions, pose significant challenges that increase the likelihood
   of misclassification errors and segmentation failures.
   Purpose
   The main goal of this study was to examine a correction procedure
   developed for enhancing FreeSurfer's (FS's) cortical thickness
   estimation tool, particularly when applied to the most challenging MRI
   obtained from participants with chronic stroke and CVD, with varying
   degrees of neurovascular lesions and brain atrophy.
   Methods
   In 155 CVD participants enrolled in the Ontario Neurodegenerative
   Disease Research Initiative (ONDRI), FS outputs were compared between a
   fully automated, unmodified procedure and a corrected procedure that
   accounted for potential sources of error due to atrophy and
   neurovascular lesions. Quality control (QC) measures were obtained from
   both procedures. Association between cortical thickness and global
   cognitive status as assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)
   score was also investigated from both procedures.
   Results
   Corrected procedures increased ``Acceptable{''} QC ratings from 18 to
   76\% for the cortical ribbon and from 38 to 92\% for tissue
   segmentation. Corrected procedures reduced ``Fail{''} ratings from 11 to
   0\% for the cortical ribbon and 62 to 8\% for tissue segmentation.
   FS-based segmentation of T1-weighted white matter hypointensities were
   significantly greater in the corrected procedure (5.8 mL vs. 15.9 mL, p
   < 0.001). The unmodified procedure yielded no significant associations
   with global cognitive status, whereas the corrected procedure yielded
   positive associations between MoCA total score and clusters of cortical
   thickness in the left superior parietal (p = 0.018) and left insula (p =
   0.04) regions. Further analyses with the corrected cortical thickness
   results and MoCA subscores showed a positive association between left
   superior parietal cortical thickness and Attention (p < 0.001).
   Conclusion
   These findings suggest that correction procedures which account for
   brain atrophy and neurovascular lesions can significantly improve FS's
   segmentation results and reduce failure rates, thus maximizing power by
   preventing the loss of our important study participants. Future work
   will examine relationships between cortical thickness, cerebral small
   vessel disease, and cognitive dysfunction due to neurodegenerative
   disease in the ONDRI study.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundBoth genetic susceptibility and dysregulated lipid metabolism
   are important susceptibilities to preeclampsia. In the study, we devote
   to investigate the associations of FOXO3 and TLR7 genetic polymorphisms
   with preeclampsia in a Chinese population.MethodsThis case-control study
   involved 335 Han Chinese pregnant women, including 177 pregnant women
   with preeclampsia and 158 healthy controls. The preeclampsia group was
   further sub-grouped into early-onset preeclampsia (EOPE, n=70)and
   late-onset preeclampsia (LOPE, n=107. Three single nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs), including FOXO3 (rs2232365, rs3761548), and TLR7
   rs3853839 were genotyped by multiplex PCR for targeted next-generation
   sequencing. The chi (2) test and multiple interaction effect analyses
   were performed to determine the association of three SNPs with serum
   lipid levels and thyroid function in women with preeclampsia.ResultsThe
   genotype (CC vs. TT+CT) distribution of rs2232365 revealed a significant
   association with LOPE (P=0.004, odds ratio=3.525 (0.95 CI:
   1.498-8.164)). No significant difference was found in the genotype and
   allele frequencies of rs3761548 and rs3853839 between controls and cases
   (P>0.05). Moreover, the genotype CT/TT of rs2232365 was significantly
   correlated with increased TG/HDL levels in the LOPE group
   (p=0.014).ConclusionsThe polymorphisms of rs2232365 are associated with
   the risk of LOPE and may modulate TG/HDL levels in pregnant women with
   LOPE.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the demonstration of high-performance tunnel junction deep
   ultraviolet (UV) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) by using plasma-assisted
   molecular beam epitaxy. The device heterostructure was grown under
   slightly Ga-rich conditions to promote the formation of nanoscale
   clusters in the active region. The device operates at similar to 255nm
   with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 7.2\% and wall-plug of
   4\%, which are nearly one to two orders of magnitude higher than those
   of previously reported tunnel junction devices operating at this
   wavelength. The devices exhibit highly stable emission, with a nearly
   constant emission peak with increasing current, due to the strong charge
   carrier confinement related to the presence of Ga-rich nanoclusters.
   Efficiency droop, however, is observed at relatively low current
   densities. Detailed temperature-dependent measurements suggest that the
   presence of efficiency droop of deep UV LEDs is largely due to electron
   overflow. Published under license by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction potential energy surfaces (IPESs) of four alkaline metal
   cations (Na+, K+, Rb+ and Cs+) complexed with phenol and catechol were
   explored by accurate ab initio calculations to investigate the interplay
   of different noncovalent interactions and their behavior along the
   alkali metal series and upon -OH substitution. Selected one-dimensional
   interaction energy curves revealed two different minimum energy
   configurations for all phenol- and catechol-metal complexes,
   characterized either by cation-pi or sigma-type interactions. For each
   investigated complex several two-dimensional IPES maps were also
   computed, exploiting the computational advantages of the MP2(mod)
   approach. The size of the alkali cation was found to play a similar role
   in modulating both kinds of complexes, as the interaction strength
   always decreases along the metal series, from Na+ to Cs+. Conversely,
   the number of hydroxyl substituents markedly affected cation-pi
   complexes vs. sigma-type ones. As a most relevant finding, in
   catechol-metal complexes the strength of cation-pi interactions is
   around half that of the sigma-type ones. It is argued that the combined
   effect of cation dimensions and hydroxyl substitution in catechol-Na+
   complexes makes sigma-type configurations remarkably more stable and
   easily accessible than cation-pi ones. Besides shedding new light on the
   origin of biological phenomena connected with underwater adhesion, the
   quantum mechanical interaction energy database provided herein may offer
   a useful reference for tuning accurate force fields, suitable for
   molecular dynamics simulations, where environmental effects might be
   also taken into account.}},

Title = {{Correlative Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Histopathology in Small
   Ruminant Listeria Rhombencephalitis}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Listeria rhombencephalitis, infection of the brainstem with
   Listeria monocytogenes, occurs mainly in humans and farmed ruminants and
   is associated with high fatality rates. Small ruminants (goats and
   sheep) are a large animal model due to neuropathological similarities.
   The purpose of this study was to define magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   features of listeria rhombencephalitis in naturally infected small
   ruminants and correlate them with histopathology. Secondly, the purpose
   of this study was to compare the results with MRI findings reported in
   humans.
   Methods: Twenty small ruminants (13 sheep and 7 goats) with listeria
   rhombencephalitis were prospectively enrolled and underwent in vivo MRI
   of the brain, including T2-weighted, fluid attenuation inversion
   recovery, and T1-weighted sequences pre- and post-contrast
   administration and postmortem histopathology. In MRI, lesions were
   characterized by location, extent, border definition, signal intensity,
   and contrast enhancement. In histopathology, the location, cell type,
   severity, and chronicity of inflammatory infiltrates and signs of
   vascular damage were recorded. In addition, histopathologic slides were
   matched to MRIs, and histopathologic and MRI features were compared.
   Results: Asymmetric T2-hyperintense lesions in the brainstem were
   observed in all animals and corresponded to the location and pattern of
   inflammatory infiltrates in histopathology. Contrast enhancement in the
   brainstem was observed in 10 animals and was associated with vessel wall
   damage and perivascular fibrin accumulation in 8 of 10 animals. MRI
   underestimated the extension into rostral brain parts and the
   involvement of trigeminal ganglia and meninges.
   Conclusion: Asymmetric T2-hyperintense lesions in the brainstem with or
   without contrast enhancement can be established as criteria for the
   diagnosis of listeria rhombencephalitis in small ruminants. Brainstem
   lesions were similar to human listeria rhombencephalitis in terms of
   signal intensity and location. Different from humans, contrast
   enhancement was a rare finding, and abscessation was not observed.}},

   Extremity Surgeons}},
Journal = {{CUREUS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of the coronavirus
   disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the practice of hand and upper
   extremity surgeons.
   Methods
   We assessed how the pandemic affected the practice on multiple fronts
   including professional, personal, and practice aspects. The survey was
   conducted through an online questionnaire that had six sections:
   demographics, clinic, elective surgery, emergency surgery, urgent
   surgery, and human resources. The survey was sent to 586 Kleinert
   Society members who are all practicing hand and upper extremity
   surgeons.
   Results
   We received 35 responses from the United States and 53 from the rest of
   the world. Based on our findings, the clinic volume was reduced by >50\%
   in the early stages, subsequently returning to a level that was 25-50\%
   lower than pre-COVID-19 times in later stages. A corresponding decrease
   in elective surgeries was also noted. The need for preoperative COVID-19
   tests added to the logistics of surgery, causing delays of three to six
   hours for emergency cases and >24 hours for urgent cases. The hand
   surgeons witnessed multiple furloughs, layoffs, and even COVID-19
   infections among nursing and support staff. Most hand surgeons continued
   to perform urgent and emergency surgeries during the pandemic. The
   application of telemedicine was not popular and had multiple drawbacks.
   Hand surgeons are modifying their practice by adopting measures such as
   social distancing, reducing the clinic volume, and using personal
   protective equipment (PPE).
   Conclusions
   As COVID-19 is likely to prevail for the foreseeable future, these
   measures are here to stay. The initial reduction in the clinic and
   elective volume has improved but has not reached pre-COVID-19 levels,
   suggesting a slow recovery. As reopening measures will lead to more
   people rejoining employment, subsequently, more patients with
   hand-related conditions are likely to present to the clinics. Rapid
   COVID-19 testing and supply of PPEs will play a crucial role in the near
   future to enable hand surgeons to continue their service while taking
   care of their personal health.}},

Title = {{Weed colonization-based performance improvement opportunities in

Journal = {{ENERGY SCIENCE \& ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Dual-mixed refrigerant (DMR) process is a promising candidate for
   liquefying the natural gas (LNG) at onshore as well as offshore sites,
   thanks to its higher liquefaction capacity and flexibility in using full
   gas turbines. DMR involves two mixed refrigerant cycles to perform
   precooling and subcooling of natural gas (NG), and these refrigerant
   compositions need constant tweaking to match the ever-changing NG
   cooling curve, as it is obtained from different gas fields. Mismatching
   of cooling curves often results in suboptimal operation, which
   ultimately leads to an increase in the overall energy consumption. Thus,
   this study is aimed at making DMR liquefaction operation close to
   optimal using the invasive-weed paradigm. At first, the decision
   variables for performance improvement were determined using degrees of
   freedom analysis then through invasive-weed paradigm the best set of
   parameters that results in minimal overall energy consumption were
   obtained. For the given set of conditions, it was found that after
   optimization, the DMR process can produce LNG using 16.2\% less
   compression power compared to the published optimized DMR process.
   Taking into account the higher sensitivity of the DMR process against NG
   feed conditions, the IWO approach was also examined to find the multiple
   optimal solutions corresponding to different sets of feed conditions.
   The thermodynamic evaluation revealed that the mixed refrigerant
   involves in NG subcooling and interstage coolers have the highest level
   of exergy destruction. After successful performance improvement of the
   DMR process, it is also found that still, 62\% improvement potential
   (based on avoidable/unavoidable exergy destruction analysis) is
   available in the DMR process that can be attained through either sole
   optimization or optimal retrofitting/revamping.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Pleural mesothelioma, a devastating asbestos-associated
   malignancy, urgently requires a novel effective therapy. Heat shock
   protein 70 (HSP70), which is synthesized in the cell response to protein
   damage, is expected to be a new target for antitumor treatment. In
   addition to its well-known protein refolding function, HSP70 regulates
   cell proliferation through different pathways, including PI3K/AKT/mTOR,
   and autophagy in malignant cells. In this study, we attempted to clarify
   the effects of VER-155008, an HSP70 inhibitor, on pleural mesothelioma.
   Methods: Human pleural mesothelioma cell lines 211H, H2452 and H28 were
   cultured with VER-155008, and protein expression, cell proliferation,
   colony formation, cell cycle, synergistic effect with cisplatin, and
   autophagy induction were analyzed.
   Results: In mesothelioma cell lines, VER-155008 (5.0 mu M or more)
   inhibited cell growth and colony formation, accompanied by G(1) cell
   cycle arrest. According to western blot analysis, VER-155008 reduced
   p-AKT expression. However, VER-155008 failed to show a synergistic
   effect with cisplatin on cell growth. Mesothelioma cells transfected
   with the novel plasmid pMRX-IP-GFP-LC3-RFP-LC3 Delta G, which was
   developed for the quantitative and statistical estimation of
   macroautophagy, showed enhanced macroautophagy upon treatment with
   VER-155008 and gefitinib which is an EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor. In
   addition, fetal bovine serum deprivation induced macroautophagy was
   further enhanced by VER-155008.
   Conclusions: On the basis of these results, functional HSP70 inhibition
   by VER-155008 suppressed cell growth in pleural mesothelioma cells,
   accompanied by enhanced macroautophagy. HSP70 inhibition is thus
   expected to become a new strategy for treating mesothelioma.
   Key points Significant findings of the study
   In pleural mesothelioma cells, inhibition of HSP70 function by
   VER-155008 suppressed cell proliferation accompanied by induction of
   autophagy which was synergistically enhanced under the starvation
   condition, whereas gefitinib, an EGFR-TKI, did not show the same
   synergistic effect in autophagy.
   What this study adds
   The inhibition of HSP70 induced autophagy and suppressed cell
   proliferation in mesothelioma cells.}},

Abstract = {{Development of facile and versatile synthetic tools for decorating
   pi-conjugated molecules has attracted considerable interest because of
   their potential application in creating novel functional pi-systems.
   Reported herein are quantitative catalyst-free hydroamination reactions
   of a series of aromatic diimide compounds having vinyl groups at the
   pi-core, which have been confirmed by NMR, UV-vis absorption
   spectroscopy, mass analysis, and single-crystal X-ray structural
   analysis. Kinetic studies revealed that the hydroamination reaction of a
   vinyl-substituted naphthalenediimide with an aliphatic amine proceeded
   rapidly under benign conditions. Similarly, the two vinyl groups
   attached to aromatic diimides reacted with amines simultaneously,
   resulting in the formation of amine bisadducts and macromolecules. An
   amino group appended perylenediimide through an ethylene spacer at the
   pi-core exhibited distinct fluorescence switching in response to acid
   and base.}},

Title = {{Distinction of surgically resected gastrointestinal stromal tumor by

Abstract = {{The diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) using
   conventional endoscopy is difficult because submucosal tumor (SMT)
   lesions like GIST are covered by a mucosal layer. Near-infrared
   hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) can obtain optical information from deep
   inside tissues. However, far less progress has been made in the
   development of techniques for distinguishing deep lesions like GIST.
   This study aimed to investigate whether NIR-HSI is suitable for
   distinguishing deep SMT lesions. In this study, 12 gastric GIST lesions
   were surgically resected and imaged with an NIR hyperspectral camera
   from the aspect of the mucosal surface. Thus, the images were obtained
   ex-vivo. The site of the GIST was defined by a pathologist using the NIR
   image to prepare training data for normal and GIST regions. A machine
   learning algorithm, support vector machine, was then used to predict
   normal and GIST regions. Results were displayed using color-coded
   regions. Although 7 specimens had a mucosal layer (thickness 0.4-2.5 mm)
   covering the GIST lesion, NIR-HSI analysis by machine learning showed
   normal and GIST regions as color-coded areas. The specificity,
   sensitivity, and accuracy of the results were 73.0\%, 91.3\%, and
   86.1\%, respectively. The study suggests that NIR-HSI analysis may
   potentially help distinguish deep lesions.}},

Abstract = {{Medicine is becoming increasingly precise. This is particularly evident
   in the field of pharmaceuticals and especially in oncology. Driven by
   the steadily growing understanding of biomedical interrelationships and

   biomarker-driven approach. This essentially enables the transition from
   efficacy to effectiveness. In order to ensure that the promise of
   high-quality, affordable precision medicine for all remains valid in the
   future, the step from efficacy in clinical studies to effectiveness in
   the practice of care is crucial in the next decade. This will be
   achieved with end-to-end precision from diagnostics to real-world

Abstract = {{A recent survey in Germany revealed the wide presence of `Candidatus
   Phytoplasma ulmi' in native elm stands. Accessions were studied for
   their genetic variability and phylogenetic relationship based on the
   conserved groEL and the variable imp gene. While the groEL sequences
   revealed a high intraspecific homology of more than 99\%, the homology
   of the imp gene dropped to 71\% between distantly related sequences.
   Twenty-nine groEL and 74 imp genotypes were distinguished based on
   polymorphic sites. Phylogenetic analysis of the groEL gene clustered all
   `Ca. P. ulmi' strains and separated them from related phytoplasmas of
   the 16SrV group. The inferred phylogeny of the imp gene resulted in a
   different tree topology and separated the `Ca. P. ulmi' genotypes into
   two clusters, one closely related to the flavescence doree phytoplasma
   strain FD-D (16SrV-D), the other affiliated with the flavescence doree
   phytoplasma strains FD-C and FD70 and the alder yellows phytoplasma
   (16SrV-C). In both phylograms, `Ca. P. ulmi' genotypes from Scots elm
   trees formed a coherent cluster, while genotypes from European white
   elms and field elms grouped less strictly. The regional distribution
   pattern was congruent for some of the groEL and imp genotypes, but a
   strict linkage for all genotypes was not apparent.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Maternal feeding anxiety (FA) was prevalent during
   puerperium and might affect infant feeding practices. This study was
   aimed to investigate the FA status in Chinese postpartum women and its
   relationship with infant feeding practices (FPs).
   Methods: Participants were from the Mother-Infant Cohort Study of China,
   in which the dietary and feeding practices, physical and psychiatric
   health for both mothers and infants were followed up from childbirth to
   next 2years. In this study the maternal feeding anxiety (FA) status at
   0-3months postpartum was assessed by Li's Self-rating Feeding Anxiety
   Scale (SFAS). Infant feeding practices (FPs) at 0-3months, including
   breastfeeding-related behaviors, responsive feeding and infant food
   refusal were investigated by self-designed questionnaire.
   Results: In total 456 mothers the average feeding anxiety scores (FAS)
   was 41.028.02 (mean +/- SD), and maternal FA prevalence were 61.4\%
   (FAS>38) with severe FA being 8.6\% (FAS>52) at 0-3months postpartum.
   The FAS was related with infant FPs, and lower maternal FAS was
   significantly related with infant colostrum feeding (40.86 +/- 8.02 vs
   44.74 +/- 11.33, P <0.05), but higher FAS was related with bottle
   feeding (41.95 +/- 8.28 vs 39.69 +/- 7.92, P <0.05). The mothers with
   severe feeding anxiety (FAS>53) were more likely to feed infants with
   bottle (ORs, 95\%CI: 2.41, 1.11 similar to 5.19). There were not
   significant association between FAS and exclusive breastfeeding and
   responsive feeding practices (P >0.05). The higher FAS was associated
   with infant food refusal behaviors, the maternal scores whose infant
   ``never{''}, ``rarely{''}, ``sometimes{''} and ``often{''} spat out food
   when feeding were 39.86 +/- 8.02, 41.47 +/- 8.18, 41.36 +/- 7.44 and
   42.14 +/- 12.03 increasingly (P >0.05), and the FA prevalence was
   significantly different among groups (P <0.05). The infants whose mother
   was identified as feeding anxiety were more likely to refuse opening the
   mouth when feeding (P <0.05). Multivariate analysis indicated maternal
   FAS was positively related to infant bottle feeding (beta i=2.487, P
   <0.05) and outdoor sunshine exposure practice (beta i=1.787, P <0.05),
   and negatively related to household income level (beta i=-0.118, P
   <0.05).
   Conclusions: Maternal postpartum feeding anxiety was associated with
   some infant feeding practices, including bottle feeding and infant food
   refusal behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{We designed, fabricated, and measured anti-reflection coating (ARC) on
   sapphire that has 116\% fractional bandwidth and transmission of at
   least 97\% in the millimeter wave band. The ARC was based on patterning
   pyramid-like sub-wavelength structures (SWS) using ablation with a 15W
   femto-second laser operating at 1030nm. One side of each of two disks
   was fabricated with SWS that had a pitch of 0.54mm and a height of 2mm.
   The average ablation volume removal rate was 1.6mm
   3/min. Measurements of the two-disk sandwich show transmission higher
   than 97\% between 43 and 161GHz. We characterize instrumental
   polarization (IP) arising from differential transmission due to
   asymmetric SWS. We find that with proper alignment of the two-disk
   sandwich, RMS IP across the band is predicted to be 0.07\% at normal
   incidence and less than 0.6\% at incidence angles up to
   20 degrees. These results indicate that laser ablation of SWS on
   sapphire and on other hard materials such as alumina is an effective way
   to fabricate broadband ARC.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},

Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{The spin-motive force (SMF), which is induced by the dynamics of
   non-uniform magnetic states having spin chirality, corresponds to the
   spin version of the electromotive force in Faraday's law of induction.
   Because magnetic dynamics produce heat through the damping effect, the
   detected SMF may include the thermoelectromotive force (TEMF) induced by
   heat, which is disadvantageous. In this study, we investigate the
   electrode-material dependence of the SMF induced by magnetic resonance
   and reveal that the heating is lower than 1K at the most and that the
   SMF barely includes the TEMF. Moreover, we extract the SMF to remove the
   slight contribution of the TEMF.}},

Abstract = {{This article aims to discuss the quality of early childhood education
   and care in Brazil and the process of infants' and toddlers' Inserimento
   to daycare. The theoretical framework of our arguments is based on the
   notion of quality of child education as a negotiated concept, and by the
   Italian concept of Inserimento. The methodology is based on the Mosaic
   Approach, a participative method to listen to young children. As part of
   the methodology, we participated in the inserimento process in five
   municipalities in southeastern Brazil, from 2016 and 2020. Data analysis
   was based on the pedagogy of listening and on studies on gender and
   racial relationships. The results show how laws, normative documents,
   family expectations, planning and routine of childhood education,
   available toys, space, babies, families, and professionals creates a
   complex mosaic of discourses about what constitutes the quality of
   childhood education in the babies' first days in daycare centers.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the availability of numerous molecular markers in maize,
   effective evaluation of all types of germplasm resources, accurate
   identification of varieties and analysis of a large number of materials
   in a timely, low-cost manner is challenging. Here, we present
   Maize6H-60K, a genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array to
   facilitate maize genotyping. We first identified 160 million variants by
   sequencing data of 388 representative inbreds and then tiled 200 000
   high-quality variants on a screening array. These variants were further
   narrowed down to 61 282 using stringent filtering criteria. Among the 60
   000 markers, 21 460 SNPs (35\%) were within genic regions and 12 835
   (21\%) were located in coding regions. To assess their effectiveness,
   329 inbreds, 221 hybrids, 34 parent-offspring sets and six breeding
   samples were genotyped. Overall, 48 972 SNPs (80\%) were categorized
   into the highest quality class, that of `poly high resolution'. A total
   of 54 658 (89.29\%) and 53 091 (86.73\%) SNPs had minor allele frequency
   values >= 0.20 in inbreds and hybrids respectively. A linkage
   disequilibrium (LD) analysis revealed that LD decline was in equilibrium
   when r(2) was between 0.10 and 0.15, which corresponds to a physical
   distance of 400-600 kb. UPGMA clustering analysis divided the 329 inbred
   lines into nine groups that were consistent with known pedigrees. A
   background analysis of breeding materials indicated that the 60 000
   markers were suitable for evaluation of breeding populations constructed
   by materials between or within heterotic groups. The developed
   Maize6H-60K array should be an important tool in maize genetic studies,
   variety identification and molecular breeding.}},

Abstract = {{Various amounts of both devulcanized (DR) and non-devulcanized (NDR)
   recycled rubber were melt compounded with a virgin ethylene-propylene
   diene monomer (EPDM) rubber. The resulting compounds were then expanded
   by using azodicarbonamide. The role played by the presence of DR or NDR
   on the thermomechanical properties of the obtained materials was
   evaluated. Electron scanning microscope micrographs highlighted that DR
   particles were better encapsulated within the EPDM matrix with respect
   to the corresponding NDR ones. Moreover, a better interfacial adhesion
   was observed with DR, probably due the re-vulcanization process in which
   the free crosslinking sites that typically characterize DR could form
   linkages with the EPDM matrix. Tensile impact behavior of expanded
   EPDM/recycled rubber blends highlighted a strong improvement of the
   normalized total absorbed energy, of the normalized impact strength and
   of the elongation at break with respect to the neat expanded EPDM for
   all the investigated compositions, and especially with a DR content of
   20 wt\%. The preparation of expanded EPDM containing considerable
   amounts of devulcanized rubber was, therefore, demonstrated to be a
   practical route to reduce the costs and improve the properties and the
   environmental sustainability of rubber products.}},

Abstract = {{Mutational analysis guides therapeutic decision making in patients with
   advanced-stage gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). We evaluated
   three targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) assays, consecutively
   used over 4 years in our laboratory for mutational analysis of 162
   primary GISTs: Agilent GIST MASTR, Illumina TruSight 26 and an in-house
   developed 96 gene panels. In addition, we investigated the feasibility
   of a more comprehensive approach by adding targeted RNA sequencing
   (Archer FusionPlex, 11 genes) in an attempt to reduce the number of Wild
   Type GISTs. We found KIT or PDGFRA mutations in 149 out of 162 GISTs
   (92.0\%). Challenging KIT exon 11 alterations were initially missed by
   different assays in seven GISTs and typically represented deletions at
   the KIT intron 10-exon 11 boundary or large insertions/deletions (>24
   base pairs). Comprehensive analysis led to the additional identification
   of driver alterations in 8/162 GISTs (4.9\%): apart from BRAF and SDHA
   mutations (one case each), we found five GISTs harboring somatic
   neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) alterations (3.1\%) and one case with an
   in-frame TRIM4-BRAF fusion not reported in GIST before. Eventually, no
   driver alteration was found in two out of 162 GISTs (1.2\%) and three
   samples (1.9\%) failed analysis. Our study shows that a comprehensive
   targeted NGS approach is feasible for routine mutational analysis of
   GIST, thereby substantially reducing the number of Wild Type GISTs, and
   highlights the need to optimize assays for challenging KIT exon 11
   alterations.}},

Abstract = {{During the last decades, rivers and their deposits in different regions
   were intensively studied to better understand the late-Quaternary
   landscape evolution and former human activities. One proxy for
   paleoecological and paleoclimatic reconstructions is the analysis of
   gastropods (snails) from carbonatic river sediments. In the scope of
   this study, we investigated gastropod assemblages from a Holocene
   fluvial sediment-paleosol sequence at the upper Alazani River in the
   southeastern Caucasus. On the one hand, we aimed to derive reliable
   independent information about possible long-lasting human activity since
   the late Neolithic-Chalcolithic in the upper Alazani floodplain. This
   was formerly suggested by n-alkane biomarker vegetation reconstructions
   from the fluvial sediments. However, the reliability of that method is
   still debated. On the other hand, we aimed to obtain reliable
   information about a formerly suggested, possibly tectonic-driven,
   large-scale shift of the river course during the Late Holocene. In
   agreement with the n-alkane biomarkers, our results demonstrate that the
   studied site was free of the natural forests during the Early and Middle
   Holocene until ca. 4.5 cal kyr BR. Since this contrasts with a
   pollen-based vegetation reconstruction from a neighboring floodplain
   that was covered with forests during that time, the open vegetation in
   the upper Alazani valley was probably caused by continuous settlement
   activity as is also indicated by archeological finds in the sequence.
   Therefore, using our paleoecological proxies it is possible that we
   identified a settlement center in the upper Alazani floodplain that was
   populated from the late Neolithic-Chalcolithic. This center was not
   known thus far, since the settlement remains are covered by thick
   floodloam today that hindered their detection during archeological
   surface surveys. Therefore, our findings suggest that the area in the
   southern Caucasus region that was settled during the
   late-Neolithic-Chalcolithic period should have been larger than was
   known thus far. Furthermore, increasing contributions of wetland
   gastropods since ca. 4 cal kyr BP confirm a local shift of the river
   course towards the investigated site during the Late Holocene, possibly
   linked with ongoing tectonic activity. However, in contrast to former
   suggestions our gastropod assemblages indicate a slow rather than abrupt
   process. Our study demonstrates the high value of gastropod assemblages
   for geoarcheological and geomorphological research in floodplains with
   carbonatic river sediments at both a regional and local spatial scale.}},

   Based on Boundary Point Cloud Features}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{For the three-dimensional (3D) pose estimation of metal blank casts
   estimate in industrial production process, a novel 6-degree-of-freedom
   (6DOF) positioning and grasping approach for industrial robots based on
   boundary features and combining structured light 3D vision and the point
   cloud matching method is proposed. The proposed approach first uses the
   Gray code plus grating phase-shift algorithm to reconstruct the 3D
   surface information of the object. Subsequently, an improved point pair
   feature (PPF) matching location method based on point cloud boundary
   extraction is proposed to realize the accurate 6DOF pose estimation of
   the object. In this method, the point cloud boundary feature is used to
   optimize the PPF algorithm. Finally, by combining with the point cloud
   preprocessing process and the improved PPF matching location method, the
   6DOF pose positioning of metal blank casting by industrial robots is
   realized. The proposed approach can accurately complete pose measurement
   and positioning of objects placed randomly in an open environment. The
   experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PPF matching location
   method significantly improves both matching speed and accuracy compared
   to the traditional PPF algorithm.}},

Title = {{Colonic vitamin D receptor expression is inversely associated with

Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   The expression of jumonji domain-containing 3 (Jmjd3) and trimethylated
   H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) in active ulcerative colitis (UC) and the
   correlation between vitamin D receptor (VDR) and the Jmjd3 pathway are
   unknown.
   AIM
   To study the relationship between VDR, Jmjd3 and H3K27me3 in patients
   with active UC.
   METHODS
   One hundred patients with active UC and 56 healthy controls were
   enrolled in this study. The patients with active UC were divided into
   groups according to mild (n = 29), moderate (n = 32) and severe (n = 29)
   disease activity based on the modified Mayo score. Vitamin D levels were
   measured by radioimmunoassay. Colonic mucosal tissues from UC patients
   and controls were collected by colonoscopy. The expression of VDR, Jmjd3
   and H3K27me3 in the intestinal mucosa was determined by
   immunohistochemistry staining.
   RESULTS
   Patients with active UC had lower levels of serum vitamin D (13.7 +/-
   2.8 ng/mL, P < 0.001) than the controls (16.2 +/- 2.5 ng/mL). In the UC
   cohort, serum vitamin D level was negatively correlated with disease
   activity (r = -0.323, P = 0.001). VDR expression in the mucosa of UC
   patients was reduced compared to that in normal tissues (P < 0.001) and
   negatively correlated with disease activity (r = -0.868, P < 0.001).
   Similar results for VDR expression were noted in the most serious lesion
   (defined as UC diseased) and 20 cm proximal to the anus (defined as UC
   normal) (P < 0.05). Simultaneously, Jmjd3 expression significantly
   increased in UC patients (P < 0.001), but no difference was found
   between the different sites in UC patients. H3K27me3 expression in UC
   patients was significantly down-regulated when compared with normal
   tissues (P < 0.001), but up-regulated in the mild disease activity group
   in comparison with the moderate disease activity group of UC patients (P
   < 0.05). Jmjd3 Level was negatively correlated with the level of VDR (r
   = -0.342, P = 0.002) and H3K27me3 (r = -0.341, P = 0.002), while VDR
   level was positively correlated with H3K27me3 (r = 0.473, P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSION
   Serum vitamin D and VDR were inversely correlated with disease activity
   in active UC. Jmjd3 expression increased in the colonic mucosa of active
   UC patients and was negatively associated with VDR and H3K27me3 level.}},

Title = {{The Business Roundtable and the politics of US manufacturing decline in
   the global 1970s}},
Journal = {{BUSINESS HISTORY}},
Abstract = {{As the `golden age of American capitalism' drew to a close in the 1970s,
   major U.S. manufacturing companies mobilised politically to defend their
   long-standing hegemony. Despite notable policy victories concerning
   labour, regulation, and fiscal policy, the self-appointed `mouthpieces'
   of U.S. industry failed to cohere around a clear agenda to confront the
   decline of U.S. manufacturing. By considering the trade positions
   promoted by the Business Roundtable, this article suggests that
   corporate elites misdiagnosed their own weaknesses and thus mobilised
   around policy preferences that quickly became outdated. The political
   and intellectual legacy of earlier battles ultimately prevented the
   Business Roundtable from developing or defending a pro-active industrial
   policy. By evaluating this confused rhetoric and stubborn adherence to
   antiquated analysis, the article highlights a crucial irony at the heart
   of modern business activism: the very political vision that had proved
   so important to their initial mobilisation ultimately hamstrung firms'
   efforts to mitigate deindustrialisation.}},

Title = {{Automated quantification of baseline imaging PET metrics on FDG PET/CT
   images of pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma patients}},
Journal = {{EJNMMI PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{Purpose For pediatric lymphoma, quantitative FDG PET/CT imaging features
   such as metabolic tumor volume (MTV) are important for prognosis and
   risk stratification strategies. However, feature extraction is difficult
   and time-consuming in cases of high disease burden. The purpose of this
   study was to fully automate the measurement of PET imaging features in
   PET/CT images of pediatric lymphoma. Methods F-18-FDG PET/CT baseline
   images of 100 pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma patients were retrospectively
   analyzed. Two nuclear medicine physicians identified and segmented FDG
   avid disease using PET thresholding methods. Both PET and CT images were
   used as inputs to a three-dimensional patch-based, multi-resolution
   pathway convolutional neural network architecture, DeepMedic. The model
   was trained to replicate physician segmentations using an ensemble of
   three networks trained with 5-fold cross-validation. The maximum SUV
   (SUVmax), MTV, total lesion glycolysis (TLG), surface-area-to-volume
   ratio (SA/MTV), and a measure of disease spread (Dmax(patient)) were
   extracted from the model output. Pearson's correlation coefficient and
   relative percent differences were calculated between automated and
   physician-extracted features. Results Median Dice similarity coefficient
   of patient contours between automated and physician contours was 0.86
   (IQR 0.78-0.91). Automated SUVmax values matched exactly the physician
   determined values in 81/100 cases, with Pearson's correlation
   coefficient (R) of 0.95. Automated MTV was strongly correlated with
   physician MTV (R = 0.88), though it was slightly underestimated with a
   median (IQR) relative difference of - 4.3\% (- 10.0-5.7\%). Agreement of
   TLG was excellent (R = 0.94), with median (IQR) relative difference of -
   0.4\% (- 5.2-7.0\%). Median relative percent differences were 6.8\% (R =
   0.91; IQR 1.6-4.3\%) for SA/MTV, and 4.5\% (R = 0.51; IQR - 7.5-40.9\%)
   for Dmax(patient), which was the most difficult feature to quantify
   automatically. Conclusions An automated method using an ensemble of
   multi-resolution pathway 3D CNNs was able to quantify PET imaging
   features of lymphoma on baseline FDG PET/CT images with excellent
   agreement to reference physician PET segmentation. Automated methods
   with faster throughput for PET quantitation, such as MTV and TLG, show
   promise in more accessible clinical and research applications.}},

Abstract = {{Context. Large-ruminant production in developing countries is
   inefficient with low growth rates and declining weights, particularly in
   the dry season.
   Aims. The impact of ad libitum supplementation of cattle with
   high-quality molasses blocks (20 kg) containing either 8\% urea (UMB) or
   nil urea (MB), was examined.
   Methods. Field trials on smallholder farms compared weight changes and
   average daily gains (ADG = g/day) data of young calves <8 months of age
   (n = 25); growing calves 8-24 months (n = 35) and lactating cows (n =
   46), of the indigenous breed when accessing either UMB or MB, with data
   being collected at Weeks 1, 4, 8 and 12. A pen study was also conducted
   at a research station involving mature, lactating crossbred cows (n =
   37). Surveys of farming families experiencing use of the blocks was
   conducted (n = 20).
   Key results. On smallholder farms, animals accessing UMBs were heavier
   than those accessing MBs at every collection day and in young calves
   these differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). ADGs were
   higher in cattle accessing UMB than in those accessing MBs. Young calves
   had the highest ADG (251-265 g/day), followed by growing calves (198-237
   g/day) and lactating cows (187-190 g/day), although differences in ADG
   between UMB and MB cohorts were not considered significant (young calves
   P = 0.562; growing calves P = 0.509; and lactating cows P = 0.993).
   Results from the pen study identified that ADGs were not significantly
   different (P = 0.933) between crossbred cows accessing MBs (236 g/day)
   and cows accessing UMBs (229 g/day). Surveys of farmers using blocks
   confirmed that their animals were calmer and healthier, and had better
   coat condition with minimal external parasites; these farmers wished to
   purchase the blocks and were willing to pay a mean up to US\$6.5 +/- 2.3
   per block.
   Conclusions. Provision of UMBs and MBs in Laos in the late dry season
   improved cattle growth rates, which is consistent with previous studies
   and far superior to the base-line data from Laos demonstrating declining
   ADGs. Farmers considered that the blocks contributed greatly to herd
   management and improved sale-ability of their cattle.
   Implications. Provision of molasses blocks on low-input smallholder
   farms in developing countries significantly improves production
   efficiency, offering an `entry point' intervention while forages are
   becoming established.}},

Abstract = {{Cumulative sum (CUSUM) plots and methods have wide-ranging applications
   in healthcare. We review and discuss some issues related to the analysis
   of surgical learning curve (LC) data with a focus on three types of
   CUSUM statistical approaches. The underlying assumptions, benefits, and
   weaknesses of each approach are given. Our primary conclusion is that
   two types of CUSUM methods are useful in providing visual aids, but are
   subject to overinterpretation due to the lack of well-defined decision
   rules and performance metrics. The third type is based on plotting the
   CUSUM of the differences between observations and their average value.
   We show that this commonly applied retrospective method is frequently
   interpreted incorrectly and is thus unhelpful in the LC application.
   Curve-fitting methods are more suitable for meeting many of the goals
   associated with the study of surgical LCs.}},

Abstract = {{Fluorescent materials generally show diverse light emission, simple
   manufacturing processes, long service life, and long-term reliability
   properties, and they have gradually become a hotspot in the field of
   anti-counterfeiting. Phosphors with multi-functions for the realization
   of dual-mode anti-counterfeiting designs are still subject to the
   tailoring difficulty, readout order restriction, detection complexity,
   etc. To solve these problems, we propose a new flexible dual-mode
   anti-counterfeiting design by using a series of phosphors MAl12O19:Cr3+
   (M = Ca and Sr) based on their both deep red/NIR dual emissions and
   afterglow. By tailoring the concentration of dopants, a similar deep red
   but strong NIR intensity comparison has been realized. In the
   fluorescent mode, the intense NIR emission that represents the effective
   information can be pictured by filtering the deep red encryption light
   under white LED. In addition, the persistent luminescence in the
   afterglow mode, which has been tuned by Ti4+ co-dopants, can be pictured
   after UV irradiation. The dual-mode information can be designed
   separately and detected independently without interference or readout
   order restriction. Such a dual-mode system with flexibility and
   simplicity properties is a good choice not only for anti-counterfeiting
   but also for the multi-layer information encryption.}},

Title = {{Metabolic engineering of Aspergillus niger via ribonucleoprotein-based
   CRISPR-Cas9 system for succinic acid production from renewable biomass}},

Abstract = {{Background Succinic acid has great potential to be a new bio-based
   building block for deriving a number of value-added chemicals in
   industry. Bio-based succinic acid production from renewable biomass can
   provide a feasible approach to partially alleviate the dependence of
   global manufacturing on petroleum refinery. To improve the economics of
   biological processes, we attempted to explore possible solutions with a
   fungal cell platform. In this study, Aspergillus niger, a well-known
   industrial production organism for bio-based organic acids, was
   exploited for its potential for succinic acid production. Results With a
   ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-based CRISPR-Cas9 system, consecutive genetic
   manipulations were realized in engineering of the citric acid-producing
   strain A. niger ATCC 1015. Two genes involved in production of two
   byproducts, gluconic acid and oxalic acid, were disrupted. In addition,
   an efficient C-4-dicarboxylate transporter and a soluble NADH-dependent
   fumarate reductase were overexpressed. The resulting strain SAP-3
   produced 17 g/L succinic acid while there was no succinic acid detected
   at a measurable level in the wild-type strain using a synthetic
   substrate. Furthermore, two cultivation parameters, temperature and pH,
   were investigated for their effects on succinic acid production. The
   highest amount of succinic acid was obtained at 35 degrees C after 3
   days, and low culture pH had inhibitory effects on succinic acid
   production. Two types of renewable biomass were explored as substrates
   for succinic acid production. After 6 days, the SAP-3 strain was capable
   of producing 23 g/L and 9 g/L succinic acid from sugar beet molasses and
   wheat straw hydrolysate, respectively. Conclusions In this study, we
   have successfully applied the RNP-based CRISPR-Cas9 system in genetic
   engineering of A. niger and significantly improved the succinic acid
   production in the engineered strain. The studies on cultivation
   parameters revealed the impacts of pH and temperature on succinic acid
   production and the future challenges in strain development. The
   feasibility of using renewable biomass for succinic acid production by
   A. niger has been demonstrated with molasses and wheat straw
   hydrolysate.}},

Title = {{Chiral-induced spin selectivity: A polaron transport model}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{Weak hyperfine interactions and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in organic
   materials result in long spin lifetimes, which is very promising for
   spintronics. On the other hand, they also make it challenging to achieve
   spin polarization, which is of crucial importance for spintronics
   devices. To overcome this obstacle, we have proposed a physical model
   for spin-polarized electron transport through a chiral molecule based on
   the chiral-induced spin selectivity. Because the transport in the chiral
   molecule is not an isolated one, but rather an electron coupled to its
   surrounding lattice distortions, namely, a spatial localized polaron, an
   indispensable polaron effect is incorporated in our model. We show that
   the polaron transport through the chiral molecule exhibits a
   spin-momentum-locked feature. Interestingly, no matter what their
   initial spin state is, all of the polarons could transmit through the
   molecule with their spins being aligned to the same orientation due to
   the effective ``inverse Faraday effect.{''} The coexistence of the
   electron-lattice coupling and SOC results in the spin and lattice being
   coupled, which leads to a strongly enhanced spin coherence and then a
   very high spin polarization of 70\%. In addition, the effects of the
   helix pitch, polaron size, and drift velocity on spin polarization are
   also discussed. Our results open the possibility of using chiral
   molecules in spintronics applications and offer a paradigm for
   information processing and transmission.}},

Abstract = {{Adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP) is a lipid
   droplet-associated protein that is expressed early during adipose
   differentiation. However, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. In
   this study, the porcineADRP(pADRP) gene regulatory mechanism and its
   relationship to intramuscular fat (IMF) content are analysed. We
   investigated the characteristics of thepADRPgene prompter as well as its
   transcription level, core promoter and epigenetic modification status
   using real-time PCR, Dual-luciferase reporter assays and bisulphite
   sequencing. The results showed thatpADRPmRNA expression inLongissimus
   Dorsi(LD) muscle of the low IMF (LEAN) group was lower than that in the
   high IMF (FAT) group (p<.01). Maximum promoter activity was found in the
   -926 bp to -235 bp region. The methylation level of the pADRP of this
   region (mainly 7th, 10th, 12th CpG sites) in the low IMF group (86.67\%)
   was significantly higher than that in the high IMF group (46.7\%)
   (p<.01). Our result plays an important role inpADRPtranscriptional
   regulation and provides a good prospect for the marbling traits
   improvement.}},

Abstract = {{Studies have started to examine factors that explain when and why
   leaders enact procedural justice. However, these studies have not
   considered the idea that justice enactment can be a self-serving
   instrument for leaders. In this paper, we propose a threat-based
   tripartite model of procedural justice enactment. Specifically, we
   examine how leaders in unstable (vs. stable) power positions combine
   information from the two fundamental dimensions of person
   perception-that is, their perceptions of a follower's competence and
   warmth-to shape the level of procedural justice they enact toward the
   follower. In support of our model, the results of a multisource
   organizational field study and a laboratory experiment show that leaders
   in unstable power positions enact procedural justice, particularly
   toward followers whom they perceive as highly competent but low in
   warmth. We discuss our findings in light of their implications for the
   justice and leadership literatures.}},

Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{We report spin-orbit torques (SOT) in a L1(0)-ordered perpendicularly
   magnetized FePt single layer, which is significantly influenced by
   disorder. Recently, self-induced SOT in the L1(0)-FePt single layer has
   been investigated, which is ascribed to the composition gradient along
   the normal direction of the film. However, the determined mechanisms for
   magnetization switching have not been fully studied. With varying growth
   temperatures, we have prepared FePt single layers with the same
   thickness (3nm) but with different disordering. We have found that
   nearly full magnetization switching only happens in more disordered
   films, and the magnetization switching ratio becomes smaller with
   increasing L1(0) ordering. The method for deriving effective spin torque
   fields in the previous studies cannot fully explain the spin current
   generation and self-induced SOT in the L1(0)-FePt single layer. Combined
   with the magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy and anomalous Hall
   effect measurements, we concluded that the disorder should determine the
   formation of domain walls, as well as the spin current generation.

Abstract = {{The efficacy and safety of triglyceride (TG) apheresis in patients with
   type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is unclear. Diabetic complications may
   predispose patients to adverse events (AEs) associated with the

   efficacy of therapeutic apheresis (TA). We investigated the effect of DM
   on the efficacy and complications of TA. Patients with severe
   hypertriglyceridemia who underwent apheresis for treatment or for the
   prevention of acute pancreatitis were included in this retrospective
   study. Epidemiological data, lipid parameters, and AEs were recorded
   before and after each therapeutic session. A total of 166 procedures
   were performed in 27 patients. Group 1 included 17 patients with type 2
   DM, and Group 2 included 10 patients without DM. The mean percentage
   decrease in TG levels (TG\%) was higher in Group 1 (71.9\% vs 60.6\%, P
   < .001). The TG\% was negatively correlated with the duration of DM in
   Group 1 (r = -.49, P < .001). The total number of TA sessions was 142 in
   patients who underwent double filtration plasmapheresis and 24 in
   patients who underwent therapeutic plasma exchange. We observed 9
   (5.4\%) mild-to-moderate AEs. No intergroup difference was observed in
   the total number of AEs (P = .06). TA is safe and effective in patients

Journal = {{ADVANCED MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},

Number = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs) are regarded as an attractive power
   source with high energy density, bio-renewability, and convenient
   storage and transportation. However, the anodic reaction of DEFCs, that
   is, the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), suffers from poor efficiency
   due to the low selectivity to CO2 (C1 pathway) and high selectivity to
   CH3COOH (C2 pathway). In this study, the selective EOR to CO2 can be
   achieved at the Rh-SnO2 interface in SnO2-Rh nanosheets (NSs). The
   optimized catalyst of 0.2SnO(2)-Rh NSs/C exhibits excellent alkaline EOR
   performance with a mass activity of 213.2 mA mg(Rh)(-1) and a Faraday
   efficiency of 72.8\% for the C1 pathway, which are 1.7 and 1.9 times
   higher than those of Rh NSs/C. Mechanism studies indicate that the
   strong synergy at the Rh-SnO2 interface significantly promotes the
   breaking of C-C bond of C2H5OH to form CO2, and facilitates oxidation of
   the poisonous intermediates ({*}CO and {*}CH3) to suppress the
   deactivation of the catalyst. This work not only provides a highly
   selective, active, and stable catalyst for the EOR, but also promotes
   fundamental research for the design of efficient catalysts via interface
   modification.}},

Abstract = {{Leucine zipper-EF-hand-containing transmembrane protein 1 (LETM1) is a
   mitochondrial inner membrane protein that is highly expressed in various
   cancers. Although LETM1 is known to be associated with poor prognosis in
   colorectal cancer (CRC), its roles in autophagic cell death in CRC have
   not been explored. In this study, we examined the mechanisms through
   which LETM1 mediates autophagy in CRC. Our results showed that LETM1 was
   highly expressed in CRC tissues and that down-regulation of LETM1
   inhibited cell proliferation and induced S-phase arrest. LETM1 silencing
   also suppressed cancer stem cell-like properties and induced autophagy
   in CRC cells. Additionally, the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine
   reversed the inhibitory effects of LETM1 silencing on proliferation and
   stemness, whereas the autophagy activator rapamycin had the opposite
   effects. Mechanistically, suppression of LETM1 increased the levels of
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial ROS by regulation of
   SOD2, which in turn activated AMP-activated protein kinase
   (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), initiated autophagy, and
   inhibited proliferation and stemness. Our findings suggest that
   silencing LETM1 induced autophagy in CRC cells by triggering
   ROS-mediated AMPK/mTOR signalling, thus blocking CRC progression, which
   will enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanism of LETM1 in
   CRC.}},

Abstract = {{Tibial tuberosity fractures are uncommon but are usually seen in
   adolescents approaching skeletal maturity. Typically this fracture
   results from an avulsion of the tibial tuberosity as the powerful
   quadriceps overcome skeletal strength in passive flexion. We present the
   case of a 17-year-old female who presented with severe pain in her left
   knee sustained after stepping off a curb. She had no significant past
   medical history apart from a raised body mass index (BMI) of 46.
   Radiographs demonstrated that she had sustained a rare type of physeal
   injury not previously reported in the literature. This unique fracture
   developed along the physeal scar but interestingly the anterior cortex
   remained intact. Closed reduction of this fracture was attempted and the
   fracture healed uneventfully leaving a slight asymptomatic positive
   slope on the tibia.}},

Abstract = {{This study is about the expectations of the future of hoteliers in the
   tourism city of Antalya who intend to start a new firm during the recent
   (geo)political crisis in Turkey. The starting point of our analysis is
   that capitalism is a dynamic open system that is full of creativity and
   novelties. That is why entrepreneurs who plan to invest face a radical
   uncertainty about the future and can neither make rational decisions nor
   form rational expectations. Instead, their decisions are based on
   fictional expectations (Beckert) as a motivational basis of action that
   are not only individually but also socially constructed by a variety of
   social factors that are never discussed both in tourism and resilience
   literature. By doing a case study, the fictional expectations of
   starting hoteliers are explored. The main results are the fictional
   expectations of hoteliers are formed in interaction with other actors in
   the tourism industry and banks, and, notwithstanding the geopolitical
   crisis that severely hit tourism and future threats such as overtourism
   and pandemic, the hoteliers are optimistic about the future because of
   believing their luxury service of their (4 and 5) star hotels and the
   place quality of Antalya, Turkey.}},

Journal = {{PLATELETS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{29-42}},
Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{Antiplatelet medications comprise the cornerstone of treatment for
   diseases that involve arterial thrombosis, including acute coronary
   syndromes (ACS), stroke and peripheral arterial disease. However,
   antiplatelet medications may cause bleeding and, furthermore, thrombotic
   events may still recur despite treatment. The interaction of collagen
   with GPVI receptors on the surface of platelets has been identified as
   one of the major players in the pathophysiology of arterial thrombosis
   that occurs following atherosclerotic plaque rupture. Promisingly, GPVI
   deficiency in humans appears to have a minimal impact on bleeding. These
   findings together suggest that targeting platelet GPVI may provide a
   novel treatment strategy that provides additional antithrombotic
   efficacy with minimal disruption of normal hemostasis compared to
   conventional antiplatelet medications. CLEC-2 is gaining interest as a
   therapeutic target for a variety of thrombo-inflammatory disorders
   including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with treatment also predicted to
   cause minimal disruption to hemostasis. GPVI and CLEC-2 signal through
   Src, Syk and Tec family tyrosine kinases, providing additional
   strategies for inhibiting both receptors. In this review, we summarize
   the evidence regarding GPVI and CLEC-2 and strategies for inhibiting
   these receptors to inhibit platelet recruitment and activation in
   thrombotic diseases.}},

   suppressed significantly and the anti-resonant frequency can be

Abstract = {{A miniaturized tri-polarized MIMO slot antenna loaded with
   slit-postwall-slot step impedance resonator (SIR) is proposed. The SIR,
   which shortens the length of radiation slot for the miniature purpose,
   consist of two slit-slot lines with high impedance and a
   slit-postwall-slot line with low impedance, because the postwall can
   decrease the characteristic impedance of slit-slot line. Meanwhile, the
   slits can improve the polarization purity and isolation of the antenna
   array effectively. Compared with the conventional slot antenna array,
   the measured results of proposed antenna array shows that the
   cross-polarization ratio has improved 2 dB on H plane and 3 dB on E
   plane at 2.45 GHz, while the lengths of ground plane and slot are
   shortened 77.8\% and 77\%, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed
   antenna array operates at dual band and the isolation are -22 dB at 2.45
   GHz and -27 dB at 4 GHz. The performance and structure of the proposed
   antenna array can be applied for the condition of high polarization

Abstract = {{A wave of green leaves and multi-colored flowers advances from low to
   high latitudes each spring. However, little is known about how flowering
   offset (i.e., ending of flowering) and duration of populations of the
   same species vary along environmental gradients. Understanding these
   patterns is critical for predicting the effects of future climate and
   land-use change on plants, pollinators, and herbivores. Here, we
   investigated potential climatic and landscape drivers of flowering
   onset, offset, and duration of 52 plant species with varying key traits.
   We generated phenology estimates using >270,000 community-science
   photographs and a novel presence-only phenometric estimation method. We
   found longer flowering durations in warmer areas, which is more obvious
   for summer-blooming species compared to spring-bloomers driven by their
   strongly differing offset dynamics. We also found that higher human
   population density and higher annual precipitation are associated with
   delayed flowering offset and extended flowering duration. Finally,
   offset of woody perennials was more sensitive than herbaceous species to
   both climate and urbanization drivers. Empirical forecast models
   suggested that flowering durations will be longer in 2030 and 2050 under
   representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5, especially for
   summer-blooming species. Our study provides critical insight into
   drivers of key flowering phenophases and confirms that Hopkins'
   Bioclimatic Law also applies to flowering durations for summer-blooming
   species and herbaceous spring-blooming species.}},

Title = {{Health assessment of wind turbine based on laplacian eigenmaps}},
Journal = {{ENERGY SOURCES PART A-RECOVERY UTILIZATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS}},
Abstract = {{With the increasing complexity of wind turbines, the current situation
   of high failure rates and high maintenance costs has attracted the
   attention of wind power operators. The research on the health status
   monitoring of wind turbines is of great significance to the development
   of the wind power industry. In this study, a novel method for evaluating
   the health status of wind turbines is proposed. The method fully
   considers the characteristics of wind turbine health status with
   high-dimensional nonlinearity. Firstly, the Gaussian kernel density
   estimation Local Outlier Factor (GLOF) is used to clean the data.
   Secondly, feature parameters are extracted by Partial Least Squares
   (PLS). Finally, the dimension reduction method based on Laplacian
   Eigenmaps (LE) is used to map the processed wind turbine data, and the
   standard deviation of horizontal and vertical scales is used as the
   health condition evaluation model to evaluate the performance of the
   wind turbine. It was validated in a large onshore wind turbine dataset
   which collected three years of Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition
   (SCADA) system data. The results show that this method can stably
   monitor the health degradation of wind turbines and provide a
   theoretical basis for the staff to arrange the maintenance time of wind
   turbines reasonably.}},

   Methods The data from patients diagnosed with CRC in the years 2000-2016
   were taken from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 18
   database. Patients were categorized according to: death from CRC,
   non-CRC cancer, and non-cancer. Constituent ratios and standardized
   mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated to describe the death causes
   distribution and relative death risks.
   Results Between 2000 and 2016, a stable and rapid drop for the original
   diagnosis as death cause for CRC patients was observed (70.19\% to
   49.35\%). This was coupled to an increase in non-cancer-associated death
   reasons (23.38\% to 40.00\%). The most common non-cancer death cause was
   heart disease, especially for elderly patients. However, deaths from
   accidents and adverse effects were frequent in younger CRC patients.
   Patients died from septicemia more often within the first follow-up
   year; however, a 6-fold increase in death from Alzheimer's disease was
   found for after at least 180 months follow-up time.
   The SMRs of all 25 non-cancer death causes initially decreased in all
   CRC subgroups, followed by an increase with follow-up times. Gradually
   decreasing SMR values were observed with increasing age of CRC patients.
   Conclusions These findings could help modify and sharpen preventive
   measures and clinical management and raise physician's awareness to
   potential non-CRC death risk factors for CRC patients.}},

Abstract = {{Indian coffee plum (Flacourtia jangomas) is an underutilized fruit with
   many great nutritional and medicinal value generally available in the
   northeastern part of India. Although rheological study of different
   fruit pulps have been studied till now, however no such study has been
   undertaken on Indian coffee plum. The present study was aimed to
   evaluate the steady-state shear and viscoelastic rheological properties
   of Flacourtia jangomas (F. jangomas) pulp as function of temperature in
   the range 20 to 80 degrees C using dynamic oscillatory viscometry, as
   well as applicability of Cox-Merz rule. Under steady-state shear tests,
   the shear stress versus shear rate data were adequately fitted to the
   Bingham model (R-2 = 1) for too low shear rate (0.1to 1.0 s(-1)) and
   Power law model (R-2 > 0.83) for moderate shear rate (1.0 to 100 s(-1)).
   Oscillatory shear data of the fruit pulp showed weak gel behavior where
   loss modulus exceeded the value of storage modulus. The power modified
   Cox-Merz rule was tested for all temperature and found applicable for
   lower temperatures. These results could be beneficial for future studies
   on food properties and industries.

Abstract = {{Gamma emission tomography (GET) detects fuel rods that emit gamma rays
   for potential use as verification tools in nuclear safeguards. In GET,
   iterative reconstruction algorithms are often used to reconstruct
   passive gamma-ray emitter source distributions. Generally, using noisy
   sinogram data, the iterative reconstruction algorithms increase the
   noise level on a reconstruction image with iterations. Thus, it is
   important to evaluate how performances of representative iterative
   reconstruction algorithms change with noisy sinogram data. The passive
   gamma-ray source distributions inside the mock-up of the water-water
   energetic reactor (WWER) fuel assembly having missing fuel rods were
   reconstructed by using the following algorithms: gradient method,
   steepest descent method, conjugate gradient reconstruction method,
   algebraic reconstruction technique, simultaneous iterative
   reconstruction technique, and maximum likelihood expectation
   maximization (MLEM). Consequently, MLEM algorithm yielded a higher
   contrast reconstruction image and was regarded as higher reliable
   algorithm to discriminate the fuel rods from the passive gamma-ray
   emitter source distribution.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FOOD PROCESSING AND PRESERVATION}},
Year = {{2021}},

Abstract = {{Propolis phytochemical extracts prepared using a ``green{''} method
   based on aqueous extraction with cyclodextrin were studied for
   antifungal activity as a natural alternative to sorbate in food
   spoilage. The synergistic antifungal effects between ``propolis green
   extract{''} (PGE) and potassium sorbate (PS) were examined against three
   common food spoilage yeast species, Torulaspora delbrueckii, Millerozyma
   farinose, and Brettanomyces bruxellensis by culture, combined with flow
   cytometry for the evaluation of microbial injury. Growth kinetics showed
   that the antifungal effect was depended on the concentration of the PGE
   and the yeast species. Interestingly, flow cytometry revealed a synergy
   between PGE and PS on cell viability which was not evident by culture.
   The results suggest that PGE could be used for natural food preservation
   through direct cell death or microbial injury as part of hurdle
   technology.
   Practical applications There is a growing demand for clean label foods,
   containing natural additives based on bioactives from plants, which can
   replace artificial ones, and can act as antioxidant and antimicrobial
   agents. Plant-derived biomolecules (phenolic substances, terpenoids, and
   flavonoids) are widely studied for their functionality as food
   antioxidants and preservatives. They have already been incorporated in
   food matrixes in the form of extracts. Propolis green extract developed
   in the current study could be used as a natural antimicrobial in food
   matrices.}},

Title = {{Using stable isotopes as tracers of water masses and nutrient cycling
   processes in the Gulf of Maine}},
Journal = {{CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{206}},
Month = {{DEC 13}},
Abstract = {{The dramatic marine environmental change seen today can be difficult to
   fully document and interpret without adequate, spatially and temporally
   comprehensive, baseline datasets of hydrographic properties. Here we
   present isotope data measured in water samples collected during a
   nine-day research cruise in October 2016 throughout the Gulf of Maine, a
   rapidly changing region of the world's oceans. A comparison of the
   oxygen isotopes of the water (delta O-18(water)) and salinity data
   reveal that water samples fall on a tight, linear mixing line between
   fresher shelf water and saltier slope waters, with the freshwater
   endmember originating from much higher latitudes (the Gulf of St.
   Lawrence and the Labrador Sea). Some subtle differences in freshwater
   endmembers are observed between the three different deep basins in the
   Gulf of Maine. These differences are likely reflecting differences in
   freshwater input and vertical mixing between the different basins.
   Additionally, these water samples have lower delta O-18(water) values
   for a given salinity value than previously published values of marine
   water mass endmembers. This offset may be related to systematic
   changesin water mass endmember values or year to year variability, as
   well as differences in the proportions of water masses entering the Gulf
   of Maine. Nitrogen and oxygen isotopes of dissolved nitrate (NO3-; delta
   N-15(NO3-) and delta O-18(NO3-), respectively) measured in the water
   samples suggest a strong influence of phytoplankton assimilation near
   the surface in both isotopic systems. Combining these two datasets using
   Delta(15, 18) to look at the rates of fractionation between the two
   isotope systems reveals potential water column nitrification above 100 m
   in most places in the Gulf of Maine. This finding provides support for
   previous hypotheses of water column nitrification in the Gulf of Maine
   based on nutrient distribution and nitrogen box modeling. However, these
   calculations rely on the assumption that all nitrate is sourced from
   deeper waters. It is possible these results are instead caused by NO3-
   from different sources at the surface and therefore do not necessarily
   indicate the presence of nitrification.}},

Abstract = {{Nano (or) microfiber structures made from biodegradable polymers offer
   many benefits for biomedical applications, including the tissue
   engineering system. In this study, a mixture of poly (lactic acid)
   (PLA)/gelatin (GEL) conjugated epidermal growth factor (EGF) electrospun
   nanofiber scaffolds, which may have potential applications for nursing
   care of diabetic wound healing. The amount of EGF conjugation on the
   PLA/GEL nanofibers was quantitated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.
   A morphological examination of the electrospun nanofibers was performed
   using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM), which has bead-free morphology nanofibers. After
   characterizing, the PLA/GEL and PLA/GEL/EGF scaffolds were selected for
   further investigation based on their superior mechanical properties,
   including tensile strength, maximum elongation, and tensile modulus. We
   evaluated the antibacterial activity, cell proliferation and the
   efficiency of diabetic wound healing in vivo. The antibacterial effect
   of EGF present in the PLA/GEL nanofibers was assessed using the zone
   inhibition test against S. aureus and E. coli. In vitro cell
   proliferation activity was well maintained after the PLA/GEL conjugation
   and was compared to that of EGF with L929 fibroblast cells. The
   nanofiber PLA/GEL conjugated with EGF exerted greater curative
   activities in vivo compared to the control groups or EGF solutions. This
   study showed that the nanofiber PLA/GEL in combination with EGF could
   potentially be used as a novel material for nursing care of wound
   healing by antibacterial, increasing inflammatory cell, and
   re-epithelialization.}},

Abstract = {{The glycoalkaloid saponin alpha-tomatine is a tomato-specific secondary
   metabolite that accumulates to millimolar levels in vegetative tissues
   and has antimicrobial and antinutritional activity that kills microbial
   pathogens and deters herbivorous insects. We describe recent insights
   into the biosynthetic pathway of alpha-tomatine synthesis and its
   regulation. We discuss the mode of action of alpha-tomatine by
   physically interacting with sterols, thereby disrupting membranes, and
   how tomato protects itself from its toxic action. Tomato pathogenic
   microbes can enzymatically hydrolyze, and thereby inactivate,
   alpha-tomatine using either of three distinct types of glycosyl
   hydrolases. We also describe findings that extend well beyond the simple
   concept of plants producing toxins and pathogens inactivating them.
   There are reports that toxicity of alpha-tomatine is modulated by
   external pH, that alpha-tomatine can trigger programmed cell death in
   fungi, that cellular localization matters for the impact of
   alpha-tomatine on invading microbes, and that alpha-tomatine breakdown
   products generated by microbial hydrolytic enzymes can modulate plant
   immune responses. Finally, we address a number of outstanding questions
   that deserve attention in the future.}},

   migration and separation from top to bottom layer. Two cell lines
   including immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial (NP460) cells and
   nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC43) cells with Epstein-Barr virus were
   compared in this study. On one-layer platforms with trench depth of 15
   mu m, both NP460 and NPC43 cells were guided to migrate along the 18-mu
   m-wide trenches, and exhibited random migration directions when the
   trench width was 10 or 50 mu m. Nearly no cell was found to migrate in
   the 10-mu m-wide trenches on one-layer platforms. However, the NP460 and
   NPC43 cells showed very different probability in the narrow trenches on
   two-layer platforms, making it possible to separate the nasopharyngeal
   epithelial cells from the carcinoma cells. Moreover, 1-mu m deep grating
   topography on the top layer inhibited NP460 cells to migrate from top
   ridges to the 10-mu m-wide trenches, but promoted such behavior for
   NPC43 cells. The results demonstrated in This study suggest that the
   engineered multiple-layer scaffold platforms could be used to separate
   carcinoma cells in NPC tumor as a potential treatment of NPC.}},

Abstract = {{Background Genome-edited donor-derived allogeneic anti-CD19 chimeric
   antigen receptor (CAR) T cells offer a novel form of CAR-T-cell product
   that is available for immediate clinical use, thereby broadening access
   and applicability. UCART19 is one such product investigated in children
   and adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic
   leukaemia. Two multicentre phase 1 studies aimed to investigate the
   feasibility, safety, and antileukaemic activity of UCART19 in children
   and adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic
   leukaemia.
   Methods We enrolled paediatric or adult patients in two ongoing,
   multicentre, phase 1 clinical trials to evaluate the safety and
   antileukaemic activity of UCART19. All patients underwent
   lymphodepletion with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide with or without
   alemtuzumab, then children received UCART19 at 1.1-2.3 x 10(6) cells per
   kg and adults received UCART19 doses of 6 x 10(6) cells, 6-8 x 10(7)
   cells, or 1.8-2.4 x 10(8) cells in a dose-escalation study. The primary
   outcome measure was adverse events in the period between first infusion
   and data cutoff. These studies were registered at ClinicalTrials.gov,
   NCT02808442 and NCT02746952.
   Findings Between June 3, 2016, and Oct 23, 2018, seven children and 14
   adults were enrolled in the two studies and received UCART19. Cytokine
   release syndrome was the most common adverse event and was observed in
   19 patients (91\%); three (14\%) had grade 3-4 cytokine release
   syndrome. Other adverse events were grade 1 or 2 neurotoxicity in eight
   patients (38\%), grade 1 acute skin graft-versus-host disease in two
   patients (10\%), and grade 4 prolonged cytopenia in six patients (32\%).
   Two treatment-related deaths occurred; one caused by neutropenic sepsis
   in a patient with concurrent cytokine release syndrome and one from
   pulmonary haemorrhage in a patient with persistent cytopenia. 14 (67\%)
   of 21 patients had a complete response or complete response with
   incomplete haematological recovery 28 days after infusion. Patients not
   receiving alemtuzumab (n=4) showed no UCART19 expansion or antileukaemic
   activity. The median duration of response was 4.1 months with ten (71\%)
   of 14 responders proceeding to a subsequent allogeneic stem-cell
   transplant. Progression-free survival at 6 months was 27\%, and overall
   survival was 55\%.
   Interpretation These two studies show, for the first time, the
   feasibility of using allogeneic, genome-edited CAR T cells to treat
   patients with aggressive leukaemia. UCART19 exhibited in-vivo expansion
   and antileukaemic activity with a manageable safety profile in heavily
   pretreated paediatric and adult patients with relapsed or refractory
   B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The results this study are an
   encouraging step forward for the field of allogeneic CAR T cells, and
   UCART19 offers the opportunity to treat patients with rapidly
   progressive disease and where autologous CAR-T-cell therapy is
   unavailable.}},

Abstract = {{Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is curative for
   transfusion-dependent thalassemia, but mixed chimerism (MC) may herald
   graft rejection. We report a child who failed bone marrow transplant
   (BMT) from matched unrelated donor (MUD) successfully salvaged with
   haploidentical peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT), but had MC
   in T-lymphocyte compartment despite near-complete donor chimerism in
   myeloid compartment. MC was successfully improved by repeated
   CD45RA-depleted donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). A 2-year-old Chinese
   girl with beta-thalassemia major underwent 12/12-MUD BMT with
   HU/AZA/Cy/Flu/Bu/TT conditioning resulted in graft rejection. As donor
   refused second donation, rescue haploidentical PBSCT was performed with
   alemtuzumab/fludarabine/treosulfan conditioning. Harvest product was
   CD3/CD45RA depleted with extra products cryopreserved. Split cell
   chimerism performed 1-month after haplo-transplant showed 97\% mother,
   3\% MUD, and 0\% host for granulocytes but 38\% mother, 62\% MUD, and
   0\% host for CD3 + T cells. In view of low haploidentical donor
   chimerism in T-lymphocyte compartment, CD45RA-depleted DLI using
   cryopreserved product was performed on day + 38, after thymoglobulin 3
   mg/kg given as T-cell depletion 3 days beforehand. T-cell chimerism
   improved to 51\% mother and 49\% MUD post-DLI. Second cryopreserved
   CD45RA-depleted DLI was given 17 days after the first DLI (day + 55),
   and 100\% full chimerism of mother's T cells was gradually established
   without significant graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or viral
   reactivation. To conclude, split lineage chimerism determination is
   beneficial to guide management strategy. For MC in T-cell compartment,
   CD45RA-depleted DLI is a potential alternative to unselected T cells as
   it carries lower risk of GVHD and infection.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the extent to which the postulates of
   socioemotional selectivity theory can be applied to the social relations
   of older adults mediated by the use of Facebook. Participants were 130
   older adults recruited at public access services to computers and
   internet in the city of Sao Paulo (82.3\% female; mean age: 67.9 years;
   mean schooling: 12 +/- 5.4 years) who should have at least one year of
   Facebook use and a minimum network of 30 contacts. Sociodemographic
   data, pattern of Facebook use (e.g., frequency of use, network size,
   self-efficacy, quality of contacts) and data related to key
   socioemotional selectivity theory-related constructs (i.e., future time
   perspective and life satisfaction scales) were collected. Structural
   equation modeling for manifest variables (path analysis) was used to
   explore the relationships with life satisfaction levels. As predicted by
   the theory, direct and positive associations were found to age and life
   satisfaction and direct and negative for age and social network size.
   Future time perspective remained as a mediator between age and life
   satisfaction. Socioemotional selectivity indicators such as reduction in
   network size and enhanced emotional closeness were not associated with
   life satisfaction. The data suggest that social relations mediated by
   Facebook may favor other strategies that maximize well-being without
   necessarily downsizing the social networks or selecting partners
   according to socioemotional criteria.}},

Abstract = {{Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is characterized by increased
   genetic instability as an essential variable of event of neoplastic
   transformation. The aim of this study was to evaluate genomic
   instability in exfoliated cells from the buccal mucosa of patients with

   Situ hybridization (DBD-FISH). Exfoliated cells from the buccal mucosa
   were obtained from 38 patients with oral cancer (case group) and from 10
   individuals without oral lesions (control group). DNA damage was
   evaluated by DBD-FISH using the whole-genome DNA probe and digital
   imaging analysis. Collaterally, HPV infection was determined utilizing
   the INNO-LiPA HPV kit. Patients with OSCC showed an increase in the
   hybridization signal five times more intense than that of the baseline
   level of DNA damage detected in control individuals. The best cutoff
   value for predicting oral squamous cell carcinoma was 67.46, and an Odds
   Ratio (OR) value of 87. HPV detection analysis revealed than one patient
   with OSCC (2.6\%) was positive for HPV. All controls were negative HPV.
   In conclusion, DBD-FISH permitted the clear visualization of level high
   of DNA damage in the buccal epithelial cells of patients with OSSC
   respect to control group. Chromosome instability in oral mucosa may be
   an individual marker of malignant transformation in OSCC.}},

   in Tibbi Dunya Lahore, an Urdu-language medical periodical. It contrasts
   the conception of the body implicit in these advertisements with that of
   earlier medieval and early modern discourses on sex. This juxtaposition
   of historically disparate discourses renders visible the colonial
   transformations of sexual subjectivity that Urdu print advertising
   presents. By juxtaposing these medical advertisements with earlier
   medico-moral discourses, one can see a shift away from technologies of
   the self, directed at managing the interiority of desire, towards the
   consumption of `small technologies' that exteriorise pleasure. This
   material suggests not only the mutual implication of ars erotica and
   scientia sexualis, but also the subversion of both by the

Abstract = {{Alpha thalassemia is a hemoglobinopathy due to decreased production of
   the alpha-globin protein from loss of up to four alpha-globin genes,
   with one or two missing in the trait phenotype. Individuals with sickle
   cell disease who co-inherit the loss of one or two alpha-globin genes
   have been known to have reduced risk of morbid outcomes, but the
   underlying mechanism is unknown. While alpha-globin gene deletions
   affect sickle red cell deformability, the alpha-globin genes and protein
   are also present in the endothelial wall of human arterioles and
   participate in nitric oxide scavenging during vasoconstriction.
   Decreased production of alpha-globin due to alpha-thalassemia trait may
   thereby limit nitric oxide scavenging and promote vasodilation. To
   evaluate this potential mechanism, we performed flow-mediated dilation
   and microvascular post-occlusive reactive hyperemia in 27 human subjects
   (15 missing one or two alpha-globin genes and 12 healthy controls).
   Flow-mediated dilation was significantly higher in subjects with
   alpha-trait after controlling for age (P = .0357), but microvascular
   perfusion was not different between groups. As none of the subjects had

Title = {{Long-term interrelations between socio-emotional and language
   competencies among preschool dual language learners in Germany}},

Volume = {{91}},

Abstract = {{Background Recent research has shown that socio-emotional and language
   competencies are positively associated with each other. However, few
   studies have explored these associations for the second language
   competencies (L2) of young dual language learners (DLLs).
   Aims This longitudinal study investigated possible bidirectional
   associations between L2 language (expressive and receptive vocabulary)
   and socio-emotional competencies among preschool DLLs.
   Sample The participants were 216 German DLLs (M-T1 = 52.67 months; SD =
   9.54; 53\% girls) who were recruited from 19 preschools.
   Method L2 skills were assessed at three time points over the course of
   one year using standardized tests for expressive and receptive
   vocabulary. Children's teachers rated their socio-emotional strengths
   and behaviour concerns. Cross-lagged panel analyses were used to examine
   the temporal interplay and longitudinal directionality of effects
   controlling for children's age, sex, type of language acquisition
   (sequential vs. simultaneous), and socio-economic status.
   Results Vocabulary skills and socio-emotional skills were positively
   correlated with one another at each time point, such that children with
   better language proficiency were rated by their teachers as children
   with higher levels of socio-emotional competence. Moreover, our results
   provided support for an effect of early socio-emotional skills (T1) on
   the relative increase in L2 vocabulary skills (T2 \& T3), particularly
   for expressive vocabulary. However, our results did not demonstrate a
   statistically significant effect of better L2 language skills on the
   relative change in socio-emotional competencies.
   Conclusion Our results suggest unidirectional longitudinal relations
   between the socio-emotional and L2 skills, signifying the role of
   socio-emotional skills for the vocabulary development of DLLs.}},

Abstract = {{Group supervision presents unique opportunities for psychotherapy
   trainees to deepen their understanding of alliance ruptures and repair
   strategies. Trainees can explore challenging clinical moments and
   benefit from diverse perspectives and support. Group supervision also
   provides trainees with multiple opportunities to experience ruptures and
   repairs firsthand in their interactions with the supervisor and other
   group members. More research, particularly research using observer-based
   methods, would enhance our knowledge of rupture and repair processes in
   group supervision. In this study, seven sessions of Alliance-Focused
   Training, a group supervision that specifically aims to improve
   trainees' abilities to recognize and negotiate ruptures, were coded for
   alliance rupture markers and repair strategies using a modified version
   of the Rupture Resolution Rating System (3RS). Excerpts of the coded
   sessions were used to illustrate AFT process in the absence of ruptures,
   and in the context of ruptures between the supervisor and trainees,
   between trainees, and between a trainee and the group. There were no
   clear examples of ruptures between trainees. The ruptures between the
   supervisor and the trainees were deemed to have only a minor impact on
   the alliance, and these minor ruptures were at least partly addressed.
   Based on the coding, themes related to supervisor authority, complex and
   subtle ruptures, and the use of metacommunication within the AFT group
   were discussed. The findings of this exploratory study suggest that the
   3RS can be useful for measuring process in group supervision and that
   greater attention to group process and ruptures within the group holds
   promise for enhancing the effectiveness of AFT.}},

Abstract = {{The manual coding of nonverbal cues by trained human coders, such as
   counting the occurrence of a specific behavior or subjective rating
   about a speaker, is still a major method in the study of nonverbal
   synchrony. However, its time-consuming nature has been a serious barrier
   to the development of the field and has made it difficult for new
   scholars to adopt the technique. Recent advances in automated coding
   techniques allow researchers to collect nonverbal behavioral data
   effectively and objectively, but it is unclear how comparable the manual
   and automated coding methods are. This study, therefore, directly
   compared both methods of coding in a face-to-face conversation
   experiment. In the manual coding, a software system C-BAS was employed
   to count the occurrence of synchrony in gesture, posture, nodding, and
   other cues. In the automated coding, a cross-correlation analysis and a
   cross-wavelet coherence analysis were separately performed for the
   participant's movement data. The results showed that the manual and
   automated coding were moderately correlated, and yielded similar
   significant differences between experimental conditions of
   conversational involvement in the degree of synchrony. Further,
   synchrony measured via both coding techniques was significantly
   associated with post-conversation self-reports. The advantages and
   disadvantages of both techniques are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Background Orotracheal intubation of infants using direct laryngoscopy
   can be challenging. We aimed to investigate whether video laryngoscopy
   with a standard blade done by anaesthesia clinicians improves the
   first-attempt success rate of orotracheal intubation and reduces the
   risk of complications when compared with direct laryngoscopy. We
   hypothesised that the first-attempt success rate would be higher with
   video laryngoscopy than with direct laryngoscopy.
   Methods In this multicentre, parallel group, randomised controlled
   trial, we recruited infants without difficult airways abnormalities
   requiring orotracheal intubation in operating theatres at four
   quaternary children's hospitals in the USA and one in Australia. We
   randomly assigned patients (1:1) to video laryngoscopy or direct
   laryngoscopy using random permuted blocks of size 2, 4, and 6, and
   stratified by site and clinician role. Guardians were masked to group
   assignment. The primary outcome was the proportion of infants with a
   successful first attempt at orotracheal intubation. Analysis (modified
   intention-to-treat {[}mITT] and per-protocol) used a generalised
   estimating equation model to account for clustering of patients treated
   by the same clinician and institution, and adjusted for gestational age,
   American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, weight, clinician
   role, and institution. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov,
   NCT03396432.
   Findings Between June 4, 2018, and Aug 19, 2019, 564 infants were
   randomly assigned: 282 (50\%) to video laryngoscopy and 282 (50\%) to
   direct laryngoscopy. The mean age of infants was 5.5 months (SD 3.3).
   274 infants in the video laryngoscopy group and 278 infants in the
   direct laryngoscopy group were included in the mITT analysis. In the
   video laryngoscopy group, 254 (93\%) infants were successfully intubated
   on the first attempt compared with 244 (88\%) in the direct laryngoscopy
   group (adjusted absolute risk difference 5.5\% {[}95\% CI 0.7 to 10.3];
   p=0.024). Severe complications occurred in four (2\%) infants in the
   video laryngoscopy group compared with 15 (5\%) in the direct
   laryngoscopy group (-3.7\% {[}-6.5 to -0.9]; p=0.0087). Fewer
   oesophageal intubations occurred in the video laryngoscopy group (n=1
   {[}<1\%]) compared with in the direct laryngoscopy group (n=7 {[}3\%];
   -2.3 {[}-4.3 to -0.3]; p=0.028).
   Interpretation Among anaesthetised infants, using video laryngoscopy
   with a standard blade improves the first-attempt success rate and
   reduces complications.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal day length has been linked to the prevalence of mood disorders,
   and however, the mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unknown.
   Previous work in our laboratory has shown that developmental exposure to
   seasonal photoperiods has enduring effects on the activity of mouse
   dorsal raphe serotonergic neurons, their intrinsic electrical
   properties, as well as on depression and anxiety-related behaviors. Here
   we focus on the possible ionic mechanisms that underlie the observed
   programming of the electrophysiological properties of serotonin neurons,
   focusing on the twin-pore K + channels TREK-1 and TASK-1 that set
   resting membrane potential and regulate excitability. Pharmacological
   inhibition of TREK-1 significantly increased spike frequency in Short
   and Equinox photoperiods, but did not further elevate the firing rate in
   slices from Long photoperiod mice, suggesting that TREK-1 function is
   reduced in Long photoperiods. In contrast, inhibition of TASK-1 resulted
   in increases in firing rates across all photoperiods, suggesting that it
   contributes to setting excitability, but is not regulated by
   photoperiod. We then quantified Kcnk2 mRNA levels specifically in dorsal
   raphe 5-HT neurons using triple-label RNAscope. We found that Long
   photoperiod significantly reduced levels of Kcnk2 in serotonin neurons
   co-expressing Tph2, and Pet-1. Photoperiodic effects on the function and
   expression of TREK-1 were blocked in melatonin 1 receptor knockout
   (MT-1KO) mice, consistent with previous findings that MT-1 signaling is
   necessary for photoperiodic programming of dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons.
   Taken together these results indicate that photoperiodic regulation of
   TREK-1 expression and function plays a key role in photoperiodic
   programming the excitability of dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons.}},

Abstract = {{This study conducted in Sri Lanka's commercial capital - Colombo,
   investigated temporal variation of condominium prices from 1998 to 2018,
   to identify price - inflation relationships and periods of concern. The
   price increased non-linearly with time without abnormal trends. Unit
   root, cointegration and vector error correction method tests showed
   inflation can explain temporal variation of semi-luxury condominium's
   price appreciation, and it showed a statistically significant (P < 0.01)
   positive impact in the long run. Price appreciation and inflation showed
   a weak negative, yet statistically significant impact for luxury
   condominiums. The impact of inflation on price appreciation in the short
   run was mostly a negative correlation and as per explanatory powers the
   impact was minor. It seemed that Sri Lankan condominium market would
   mostly be without any periods of concern considering the increasing
   presales and the decreasing price to rental ratios. However, there is a
   continuous increment of the ratio between the price and household annual
   income, and it was about 5.25 as at 2018 (price bubbles occurred when
   this ratio is over six). More studies are recommended specially on
   future periods of concern and studies that incorporate ultra-luxury
   apartments being developed by international developers.}},

Abstract = {{Background Obeticholic acid (OCA) was recently approved as the only
   on-label alternative for patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC)
   with intolerance or suboptimal response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA).
   However, few data are available outside clinical trials.
   Aim To assess the effectiveness and safety of OCA in a real-world cohort
   of patients with non-effective UDCA therapy.
   Methods Open-label, prospective, real-world, multicentre study,
   enrolling consecutive patients who did not meet Paris II criteria, from
   18 institutions in Spain and Portugal. Effectiveness was assessed by the
   changes in GLOBE and UK-PBC scores from baseline. POISE and Paris II
   criteria were evaluated after 12 months of OCA . Liver fibrosis was
   evaluated by FIB-4 and AST to platelet ratio index (APRI).
   Results One hundred and twenty patients were eligible, median time since
   PBC diagnosis 9.3 (4.0-13.8) years, 21.7\% had cirrhosis, and 26.7\%
   received had previous or concomitant treatment with fibrates.
   Seventy-eight patients completed at least 1 year of OCA. The Globe-PBC
   score decreased to 0.17 (95\% CI 0.05 to 0.28; P = 0.005) and the UK-PBC
   score decreased to 0.81 (95\% CI -0.19 to 1.80; P = 0.11). There was a
   significant decrease in alkaline phosphatase of 81.3 U/L (95\% CI 42.5
   to 120; P < 0.001), ALT 22.1 U/L (95\% CI 10.4 to 33.8; P < 0.001) and
   bilirubin 0.12 mg/dL (95\% CI 0 to 0.24; P = 0.044). FIB-4 and APRI
   remained stable. According to the POISE criteria, 29.5\% (23 out of 78)
   achieved response. The adverse events rate was 35\%; 11.67\%
   discontinued (8.3\% due to pruritus).
   Conclusions This study supports data from phase III trials with
   significant improvement of PBC-Globe continuous prognostic marker score
   among OCA-treated patients with good tolerability.}},

Abstract = {{While citizenries' responses to sociopolitical events are often studied,
   how youth engage with such happenings remains unclear. This article
   therefore analyzes 45 texts written by individuals under the age of

   Chernihiv-following the Euromaidan of 2013-14. The study reveals the
   ways young Ukrainians absorbed, upheld, and (re)inscribed national
   narratives and discourses in light of the demonstrations and subsequent

   sustained into the future, the paper emphasizes the wide-reaching
   effects of sociopolitical happenings on a country's entire population.}},

   the toughness of solvent cast PVA/pectin blends}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{18}},
Month = {{MAY 10}},
Abstract = {{Blending water soluble synthetic polymers, such as polyvinyl alcohol
   (PVA), with natural polymers, such as pectin, has many advantages.
   However, due to the brittle nature of pectin, the mechanical properties
   become inferior in the blends. In this work, two strategies to enhance
   the toughness and tensile strength of solvent cast PVA/pectin blends are
   presented. This study shows that the tensile strength and toughness of
   PVA/pectin 80/20 blends can be enhanced by decreasing the solvent
   evaporation rate. The phase separation proceeds through `nucleation and
   growth' and spinodal decomposition, respectively, at lower and higher
   rates of solvent evaporation. The equilibrium phase morphology has
   spherical domains of pectin dispersed in the PVA matrix. The size of the
   pectin domains and the separation between them are controlled by the
   solvent evaporation rate. At higher rates of solvent evaporation, pectin
   domains are larger and farther apart from each other and vice versa.
   Ionically crosslinking the pectin domains with calcium, further enhances
   the tensile strength and toughness of the blends compared to that of
   pure PVA. When the pectin domains are small, the failure happens at
   larger strains through `cavitation' and `shear yielding' and when pectin
   domains are large, the failure happens at smaller strains and the
   failure mechanism shifts to `multiple crazing'.}},

Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{257-266}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we draw on empirical research and theoretical models of
   refugee and posttrauma mental health to propose the ``Psychological
   Interaction with Environment (PIE) Matrix Model{''} of refugee mental
   health. This model focuses on the mental health of adult refugees and
   proposes that psychological factors and the external environment
   interact to influence mental health outcomes and functioning for
   individuals with refugee backgrounds. Environmental factors include
   adversity faced before, during, and after the migration journey,
   including adversity faced in a resettlement or postdisplacement
   environment. Psychological factors refer to psychological (i.e.,
   cognitive and emotional) mechanisms that individuals may use to cope
   with adversity. We posit that individuals from refugee backgrounds are
   likely to show individual differences in psychological processes that
   may protect against or underpin the development and maintenance of
   psychopathology following exposure to trauma and displacement. The PIE
   Matrix Model proposes a framework to guide intervention by identifying
   key pathways by which psychological and environmental factors impact one
   another. We suggest that psychological interventions can be targeted
   according to the kind and level of support different individuals may
   require, based on individualized and context-driven assessments of the
   interaction between environmental and psychological factors at any given
   point in time. This model draws on existing models of refugee adaptation
   and highlights the need for longitudinal and experimental research to
   explain the interaction between these factors and their causal impact on
   refugee mental health.}},

Abstract = {{Using the first set of individual compensation and public data for
   senior executives in South Korea, we document direct evidence on the
   level, construction, and mechanisms of CEO remuneration in South Korea
   and perform a matched sample to comparisons between Korea and the United
   States. Our findings show that there are some differences between the
   Korean and the U.S. systems. In South Korea, chief executives are paid
   mainly in salary. Option grants and long-term incentives are less
   important. The pay-performance sensitivity of South Korean CEOs is not
   as high as in the United States.}},

Abstract = {{Background N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification may participate in the
   regulation of occurrence and development of tumors. However, the m6A
   level and the potential regulatory mechanism of m6A in gastric cancer
   (GC) remain uncertain.
   Methods RNA m6A quantification assay was conducted to detect the m6A
   level in GC tissues and cell lines. Methyltransferase-like 14 (METTL14)
   expression in GC tissues was explored by bioinformatics and
   immunohistochemistry. Then, the function of METTL14 in GC cells was
   examined by CCK-8, colony formation assay, wound healing assay, and
   Transwell assay. Besides, Western blotting was conducted to probe the
   PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and the epithelial-mesenchymal transformation
   (EMT) pathway-related gene expression.
   Results The m6A modification level was decreased in GC and METTL14 was a
   key regulator resulting in m6A disorder in GC. METTL14 was downregulated
   in GC by analyzing both clinical samples and bioinformatics. METTL14
   overexpression suppressed GC cell proliferation and aggression by
   deactivating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and the EMT pathway,
   respectively.
   Conclusions Our findings indicate that METTL14 partakes in the
   biological process of GC as a tumor suppressor and may be an emerging
   biomarker in GC.}},

Journal = {{DEPOSITIONAL RECORD}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{52-63}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Sandstone composition is influenced by multiple factors, including
   acidic weathering, occurring during storage in the hinterland, prior to
   deposition. This study aims to better understand and constrain how the
   nature and duration of such pre-depositional factors might impact the
   final sediment composition. Mid-Carboniferous deltaic sandstones from
   the Clare Basin, western Ireland, for which depositional environments
   and provenance are well constrained, are the target of this study.
   Conventional heavy mineral analysis and specific heavy mineral ratios,
   such as the apatite-tourmaline index are utilised to examine these
   phenomena. Relatively high apatite-tourmaline index values observed in
   channelised sandstones contrast with lower values seen in sandstones
   associated with mouth bar and interdistributary bay facies. These
   variations are not linked to changes in provenance and thus potentially
   indicate differences in weathering intensity due to variable duration of
   alluvial storage. These changes are probably linked with shorter
   hinterland residence time in the channelised than in mouth bar and
   interdistributary bay sandstones. Variations are seen in the
   rutile-zircon index without any clear link with facies. These
   fluctuations could be ascribed to variable supply from a source, which
   is relatively rich in rutile but poor in zircon and apatite. Despite the
   apatite component in these sandstones being partially derived from
   recycled sources, the apatite-tourmaline index stills appears to hold
   information on the last sedimentary cycle.}},

   design Using population-based datasets, 1314 infants with HIE born in
   2010-2016 were evaluated. The characteristics associated with follow-up
   were identified through multivariable logistic regression. Results
   73.9\% of infants attended HRIF by age 1. Follow-up rates increased and
   variation in follow-up by clinic decreased over time. Female infants;
   those born to African-American, single, less than college-educated, or
   publicly insured caregivers; and those referred to high-volume or
   regional programs had lower follow-up rates. In multivariable analysis,
   Asian and Pacific Islander race/ethnicity had lower odds of follow-up;
   infants with college- or graduate school-educated caregivers or referred
   to mid-volume HRIF programs had greater odds. Conclusion
   Sociodemographic and program-level characteristics were associated with
   lack of follow-up among HIE infants. Understanding these characteristics

Abstract = {{Background Transcatheter tricuspid valve repair (TTVR) is a promising
   technique for the treatment of tricuspid regurgitation (TR). Data
   comparing the performance of novel edge-to-edge devices (PASCAL and
   MitraClip-XTR) are scarce. Methods We identified 80 consecutive patients
   who underwent TTVR using either the PASCAL or MitraClip-XTR system to
   treat symptomatic TR from July 2018 to June 2020. To adjust for baseline
   imbalances, we performed a propensity score (PS) 1:1 matching. The
   primary endpoint was a reduction in TR severity by at least one grade at
   30 days. Results The PS-matched cohort (n = 44) was at high-surgical
   risk (EuroSCORE II: 7.5\% {[}interquartile range (IQR) 4.8-12.1\%]) with
   a mean TR grade of 4.3 +/- 0.8 and median coaptation gap of 6.2 mm
   {[}IQR 3.2-9.1 mm]. The primary endpoint was similarly observed in both
   groups (PASCAL: 91\% vs. MitraClip-XTR: 96\%). Multiple device
   implantation was the most common form (59\% vs. 82\%, p = 0.19), and the
   occurrence of SLDA was comparable between the PASCAL and MitraClip-XTR
   system (5.7\% {[}2 of 35 implanted devices] vs. 4.4\% {[}2 of 45
   implanted devices], p = 0.99). No periprocedural death or conversions to
   surgery occurred, and 30-day mortality (5.0\% vs. 5.0\%, log-rank p =
   0.99) and 3-month mortality (10.0\% vs. 5.0\%, log-rank p = 0.56) were
   similar between both groups. During follow-up, functional NYHA class,
   6-min walking distance, and health status improved in both groups.
   Conclusions Both TTVR devices, PASCAL and MitraClip-XTR, appeared
   feasible and comparable for an effective TR reduction. Randomized
   head-to-head comparisons will help to further define the appropriate
   scope of application of each system.}},

Abstract = {{The response of cultivars to iron (Fe) deficiency and the effects of
   cultivars on Fe-nutrition of rootstocks was investigated through
   Active-Fe content of the leaf. Leaf samples were taken from the
   mid-sections of the nursery trees and they were subjected to Active-Fe
   and Total-Fe analyses. There were significant differences in
   Fe-nutrition of ungrafted rootstocks, but differences were not observed
   when the rootstocks were grafted pear cultivars cv. `Deveci' and `Santa
   Maria.' On the other hand, significant differences were observed between
   the cultivars when they were grafted on different rootstocks. The effect
   of cultivar on Fe-nutrition of the rootstock was also found to be
   significant. According to the ungrafted rootstock, cultivars except
   `Deveci' grafted on Old Home x Farmingdale (OHxF) 333 (OHF 333)
   decreased the Fe-nutrition of the rootstock. The combination of OHF 333
   x `Deveci' was quite different and it significantly improved the
   Fe-uptake of the rootstock. It should be taken into consideration
   cultivar-induced and/or rootstock x cultivar combinations-induced
   differences under chlorosis-induced conditions at the new pear orchard

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Rhizosphere bacteria, whether phytopathogenic or phytobeneficial, are
   thought to be perceived by the plant as a threat. Plant Growth-Promoting
   Rhizobacteria (PGPR), such as many strains of the Azospirillum genus
   known as the main phytostimulator of cereals, cooperate with host plants
   and favorably affect their growth and health. An earlier study of rice
   root transcriptome, undertaken with two rice cultivars and two
   Azospirillum strains, revealed a strain-dependent response during the
   rice-Azospirillum association and showed that only a few genes,
   including some implicated in plant defense, were commonly regulated in
   all tested conditions. Here, a set of genes was selected from previous
   studies and their expression was monitored by qRT-PCR in rice roots
   inoculated with ten PGPR strains isolated from various plants and
   belonging to various genera (Azospirillum, Herbaspirillum,
   Paraburkholderia). A common expression pattern was highlighted for four
   genes that are proposed to be markers of the rice-PGPR interaction: two
   genes involved in diterpenoid phytoalexin biosynthesis (OsDXS3 and
   OsDTC2) and one coding for an uncharacterized protein (Os02g0582900)
   were significantly induced by PGPR whereas one defense-related gene
   encoding a pathogenesis-related protein (PR1b, Os01g0382000) was
   significantly repressed. Interestingly, exposure to a rice bacterial
   pathogen also triggered the expression of OsDXS3 while the expression of
   Os02g0582900 and PR1b was down-regulated, suggesting that these genes
   might play a key role in rice-bacteria interactions. Integration of
   these results with previous data led us to propose that the jasmonic
   acid signaling pathway might be triggered in rice roots upon inoculation
   with PGPR.}},

Abstract = {{Glomalin produced by fungal mycelium represents a significant

   with the transition from forest to meadow or field conditions at the
   four transects during the 2016 growing season. The method Near Infrared
   Spectrometry was applied for measuring the amount of GRSP. The
   measurements have demonstrated that the amount of GRSP decreased both in
   the points adjacent to the ecotone in the meadow and the field at the
   Bukovinka and the Proklest A transects. At the two transects, the
   changes in the amount of GRSP between the forest, the ecotone and the

Month = {{DEC 11}},
Abstract = {{Silicon carbide (SiC) formation plays an important role during the
   production of elemental silicon. SiC forms through a high temperature
   reaction between silicon monoxide gas (SiO) and carbon. Currently, the
   carbon sources are solids, however finding a way of substituting the
   solid carbon with methane could have several advantages. SiC formation
   was studied in argon, hydrogen and methane containing atmospheres at
   1650 degrees C and 1750 degrees C. SiO gas was generated from pellets of
   a 1:2 molar ratio of SiC and silica (SiO2). The reactions were
   investigated through CO off-gas analysis in conjunction with measuring
   the weight change. After each experiment, the reaction products were
   examined in a scanning electron microscope with secondary electrons and
   through energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. It was confirmed that SiC
   may form from SiO and methane. Increasing the methane content to 5\%
   caused a significant increase in SiC formation. Furthermore, the SiC
   structure was also highly sensitive to the methane content that was
   used. In addition, the SiO producing reaction was affected by hydrogen.
   The hydrogen lead to an increased rate of SiO formation relative to what
   was seen in argon. The effect of hydrogen was most pronounced at 1750
   degrees C which is right after the melting of silica.}},

Abstract = {{Factor score regression has recently received growing interest as an
   alternative for structural equation modeling. However, many applications
   are left without guidance because of the focus on normally distributed
   outcomes in the literature. We perform a simulation study to examine how
   a selection of factor scoring methods compare when estimating regression
   coefficients in generalized linear factor score regression. The current
   study evaluates the regression method and the correlation-preserving
   method as well as two sum score methods in ordinary, logistic, and
   Poisson factor score regression. Our results show that scoring method
   performance can differ notably across the considered regression models.
   In addition, the results indicate that the choice of scoring method can
   substantially influence research conclusions. The regression method
   generally performs the best in terms of coefficient and standard error
   bias, accuracy, and empirical Type I error rates. Moreover, the
   regression method and the correlation-preserving method mostly
   outperform the sum score methods.}},

Journal = {{BIOPOLYMERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{111}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The delivery of agrochemicals is typically achieved by the spraying of
   fossil-based polymer dispersions, which might accumulate in the soil and
   increase microplastic pollution. A potentially sustainable alternative
   is the use of biodegradable nano- or micro-formulations based on
   biopolymers, which can be degraded selectively by fungal enzymes to
   release encapsulated agrochemicals. To date, no hemicellulose
   nanocarriers for drug delivery in plants have been reported. Xylan is a
   renewable and abundant feedstock occurring naturally in high amounts in
   hemicellulose - a major component of the plant cell wall. Herein, xylan
   from corncobs was used to produce the first fungicide-loaded xylan-based
   nanocarriers by interfacial polyaddition in an inverse miniemulsion
   using toluene diisocyanate (TDI) as a crosslinking agent. The
   nanocarriers were redispersed in water and the aqueous dispersions were
   proven to be active in vitro against several pathogenic fungi, which are
   responsible for fungal plant diseases in horticulture or agriculture.
   Besides, empty xylan-based nanocarriers stimulated the growth of fungal
   mycelium, which indicated the degradation of xylan in the presence of
   the fungi, and underlined the degradation as a trigger to release a
   loaded agrochemical. This first example of crosslinked xylan-based
   nanocarriers expands the library of biodegradable and biobased
   nanocarriers for agrochemical release and might play a crucial role for
   future formulations in plant protection.}},

Title = {{Physiotherapy in Haiti: A qualitative study exploring local clinicians'
   perspectives}},
Journal = {{PHYSIOTHERAPY RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background and Purpose: The physiotherapy profession in Haiti has seen
   many changes since the earthquake in 2010, due to the increased number
   of Haitians living with permanent impairments. The earthquake sparked a
   significant humanitarian response. Research shows that the response
   focused mainly on providing short-term rehabilitation services without
   sustained efforts to develop sustainable rehabilitation services. A
   decade later, little is known about the state of the Haitian
   physiotherapy profession. The purpose of this study was to explore the
   perspectives of Haitian physiotherapy professionals regarding the
   current state of the profession in terms of strengths, weaknesses,
   opportunities and threats.
   Methods: We used a qualitative exploratory descriptive design. This
   study consisted of two phases: (1) a survey to identify potential
   interview participants, and identify preliminary themes to be explored
   in the follow-up interviews, and (2) a series of semi-structured
   qualitative interviews. We performed a thematic analysis of the
   interview transcripts.
   Results: Four physiotherapists and one rehabilitation technician
   participated in the interviews. Six interrelated themes emerged, each
   having a systemic impact on the development of physiotherapy and
   rehabilitation services in Haiti: (1) physiotherapy as an emerging
   field, (2) government funding and planning of physiotherapy services,
   (3) accessibility to physiotherapy services, (4) relationship with
   doctors, (5) international collaboration, and (6) Haitian physiotherapy
   associations.
   Conclusion: This study highlights the ongoing efforts of local
   physiotherapy associations in advocating for the profession in Haiti,
   which has become one of the profession's main strengths. The lack of
   government funding and service planning was considered a significant
   barrier to overcome, as was the aftermath of the earthquake's emergency
   response. Future international efforts could focus on supporting local
   physiotherapy associations and organisations in their endeavours to
   develop sustainable rehabilitation services.}},

Abstract = {{The size of maximum antichains in the product of n linear orders is
   known when the n linear orders have the same length. We present an exact
   expression for the size of maximum antichains when the linear orders
   have (possibly) different lengths. From this, we derive an exact
   expression for the size of maximum antichains in the product of n linear
   orders with the same length. This expression is equivalent to but
   different from the existing expression. It allows us to present an
   asymptotic result for the size of maximum antichains of n linear orders

Abstract = {{A sepak takraw - a ball used for a game in Thailand - is an
   icosahedrally symmetric shape woven from six bands of rattan. We model
   it with a multi-parameter family of surfaces, all having icosahedral
   symmetry. This leads us to ask and answer the question: In how many
   other ways can we arrange some number of bands in space to create
   polyhedral symmetry. Our models resemble objects created by other
   artists; the difference here is that we use Fourier series and focus on
   the role of the symmetry group. Our general formulas describe a large
   space of potentially wonderful designs. The instructions always lead to
   symmetry, but perhaps bad design, until one experiments by altering the
   parameters. The shapes produced by this method are suitable for artistic
   development as digital prints or 3D sculptures. We hope that our recipes
   will empower readers to create their own artistic renditions.}},

Abstract = {{{[}F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET and
   {[}I-123]metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy may contribute to
   the differential diagnosis of neurodegenerative parkinsonism. To
   identify the superior method, we retrospectively evaluated 54 patients
   with suspected neurodegenerative parkinsonism, who were referred for FDG
   PET and MIBG scintigraphy. Two investigators visually assessed FDG PET
   scans using an ordinal 6-step score for disease-specific patterns of
   Lewy body diseases (LBD) or atypical parkinsonism (APS) and assigned the
   latter to the subgroups multiple system atrophy (MSA), progressive
   supranuclear palsy (PSP), or corticobasal syndrome. Regions-of-interest
   analysis on anterior planar MIBG images served to calculate the
   heart-to-mediastinum ratio. Movement disorder specialists blinded to
   imaging results established clinical follow-up diagnosis by means of
   guideline-derived case vignettes. Clinical follow-up (1.7 +/- 2.3 years)
   revealed the following diagnoses: n = 19 LBD (n = 17 Parkinson's disease
   {[}PD], n = 1 PD dementia, and n = 1 dementia with Lewy bodies), n = 31
   APS (n = 28 MSA, n = 3 PSP), n = 3 non-neurodegenerative parkinsonism; n
   = 1 patient could not be diagnosed and was excluded. Receiver operating
   characteristic analyses for discriminating LBD vs. non-LBD revealed a
   larger area under the curve for FDG PET than for MIBG scintigraphy at
   statistical trend level for consensus rating (0.82 vs. 0.69, p = 0.06;
   significant for investigator \#1: 0.83 vs. 0.69, p = 0.04). The analysis
   of PD vs. MSA showed a similar difference (0.82 vs. 0.69, p = 0.11;
   rater \#1: 0.83 vs. 0.69, p = 0.07). Albeit the notable differences in
   diagnostic performance did not attain statistical significance, the
   authors consider this finding clinically relevant and suggest that FDG
   PET, which also allows for subgrouping of APS, should be preferred.}},

Title = {{Altered diversity and composition of gut microbiota in Wilson's disease}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Month = {{DEC 11}},
Abstract = {{Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of
   chronic copper toxicosis with high mortality and disability. Recent
   evidence suggests a correlation between dysbiosis in gut microbiome and
   multiple diseases such as genetic and metabolic disease. However, the
   impact of intestinal microbiota polymorphism in WD have not been fully
   elaborated and need to be explore for seeking some microbiota benefit
   for WD patients. In this study, the 16S rRNA sequencing was performed on
   fecal samples from 14 patients with WD and was compared to the results
   from 16 healthy individuals. The diversity and composition of the gut
   microbiome in the WD group were significantly lower than those in
   healthy individuals. The WD group presented unique richness of
   Gemellaceae, Pseudomonadaceae and Spirochaetaceae at family level, which
   were hardly detected in healthy controls. The WD group had a markedly
   lower abundance of Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Verrucomicrobia, and a
   higher abundance of Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria and
   Fusobacteria than that in healthy individuals. The Firmicutes to
   Bacteroidetes ratio in the WD group was significantly lower than that of
   healthy control. In addition, the functional profile of the gut
   microbiome from WD patients showed a lower abundance of bacterial groups
   involved in the host immune and metabolism associated systems pathways
   such as transcription factors and ABC-type transporters, compared to
   healthy individuals. These results implied dysbiosis of gut microbiota
   may be influenced by the host metabolic disorders of WD, which may
   provide a new understanding of the pathogenesis and new possible
   therapeutic targets for WD.}},

Title = {{Do well-reputed companies carry out higher quality social reporting? An
   empirical approach}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL}},
Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this research objective was to analyse social
   reporting within MERCO Business companies both from the point of view of
   the quantity of information disclosed and the references about their
   quality. This approach constitutes a novelty with respect to previous
   literature on the subject. Design/methodology/approach This paper
   assesses how social reporting is being carried out by the companies
   included in the MERCO Corporate Reputation Business Monitor, MERCO
   Business, during the period 2014-2016. The methodological design include
   the construction of a weighted index based on two unweighted indexes
   related to the quantity revealed and the quality detected. In addition,
   this study integrates intellectual capital and social responsibility
   approaches in order to deep into these voluntary disclosures. Findings
   While social reporting is considerable from a quantitative point of view
   within MERCO Business companies, they do not reach very high levels of
   quality, which is good to counteract the final value of the
   quantity-quality index that the authors' propose. Research
   limitations/implications In MERCO Business companies, quantity is not a
   proxy for quality within social reporting. In this sense, only
   considering both dimensions it will be possible to assess these
   disclosures in a more complete way. Practical implications This study
   allows a more accurate and comparable view of social reporting than
   those studies that only focus on how much information is disclosed.
   Besides, it involves an important advance in the identification of the
   relative quality of social reporting, opening a new line of research
   that will be key to comparing this type of disclosures in a more
   homogeneous way. Likewise, the results can be applied in future studies
   in the intellectual capital field given the complementarity between both
   types of disclosures. Social implications Likewise, these results will
   be of interest for future actions aimed at regulating the improvement of
   the quality of social reporting in the hands of managers, investors and
   regulators. Originality/value The authors have tested the value of
   quality in social reporting using a weighted index amongst the most
   reputable companies in the Spanish scenario. These disclosures have been
   compared with and without the use of it in order to deduce its value to
   obtain valid conclusions about social reporting.}},

Journal = {{ROCK AND SOIL MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{3910-3918}},
Month = {{DEC 11}},
Abstract = {{To study the dynamic response characteristics of host rockmass and
   supporting bolt under blasting load, a three-dimensional dynamic loading
   physical model test was performed using an underground engineering model
   test system. The propagation law of blasting seismic wave and the
   dynamic response characteristics of supporting bolt were tested using
   electric spark source instead of traditional explosives. Experimental
   research results show that the electric spark source has the
   characteristic of the impact loading, which can well replace traditional
   high explosives. The radial acceleration peak values and the axial and
   hoop strain peak values of blasting seismic wave within host rock do not
   decrease gradually as the increasing of the radial distance along the
   excavation, but show a wave-like attenuation pattern of positive and
   negative alternating. In addition, the acceleration peak values show a
   nonlinear and decrease gradually along the excavation axial direction.
   The peak acceleration values are affected largely by the seismic load
   amplitude, that is, the higher the source load, the higher the peak
   acceleration value at the same measurement point. In addition, the
   vibration characteristics of the supporting bolt were measured under
   blasting load. It is found that the extension anchor bolt, the free
   section of the anchor bolt is mainly in tension state, but the anchor
   section of the bolt is in the state of both tension and compression. The
   maximum tensile strain of the anchor and free section is approximately
   the same, while the maximum compressive strain of the anchor section is
   much larger than that of the free section. The vibration duration of
   anchor section and free section is also approximately similar. As for
   the full-anchored bolt, the bolt has subjected both a tensile state and
   a compressive state, and the tensile strain is greater than the
   compressive strain. As for the end-anchored bolt, the stress state is
   mainly in the tension state, and the tensile strain is much greater than
   the compressive strain. The research conclusion not only has important
   theoretical significance, but also can provide predictable guidance for
   the ground support design of underground excavation.}},

   productivity (TP) and scale efficiency change (SEC). Second, following
   the efficiency assessment, we carry post-efficiency analysis to identify
   the determinants of efficiency of the public hospitals. The results show
   that annual average TFP growth rate is 1.38\%, which is driven mainly by
   TEC. Regional disparities of public hospitals' performance are
   expanding. Almost 75\% of the regions considered show a positive TFP
   growth. The regression results show that the significant determinants of
   efficiency of regional public hospitals include the price of and demand

Abstract = {{B-cell translocation gene 3 (BTG3) is a member of the antiproliferative
   BTG gene family and is a downstream target of p53. Here, we show that
   senescence triggered by BTG3 depletion was accompanied by a secretome
   enriched with cytokines, growth factors, and matrix-remodeling enzymes,
   which could promote angiogenesis and cell scattering in vitro. We
   present evidence that at least part of these activities can be explained
   by elevated HIF-1 alpha activity. Mechanistically, the BTG3 C-terminal
   domain competes with the coactivator p300 for binding the HIF-1 alpha
   transactivation domain. The angiogenic promoting effect of BTG3
   knockdown was largely diminished upon co-depletion of HIF-1 alpha,
   indicating that HIF-1 alpha is a major downstream target of BTG3 in the
   control of angiogenesis. In vivo, ectopic expression of BTG3 suppresses
   angiogenesis in xenograft tumors; and syngenic tumor growth and
   metastasis were enhanced in Btg3-null mice. Moreover, analysis of
   clinical datasets revealed that a higher BTG3/VEGFA expression ratio
   correlates with improved patient survival in a number of cancer types.
   Taken together, our findings highlight the non-autonomous regulation of
   tumor microenvironment by BTG3 while suppressing tumor progression.}},

Abstract = {{The COVID-19 pandemic caused by novel SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in an
   unprecedented loss of lives and economy around the world. In this study,
   search for potential inhibitors against two of the best characterized
   SARS-CoV-2 drug targets: S1 glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD)
   and main protease (3CL(Pro)), was carried out using the soy cheese
   peptides. A total of 1,420 peptides identified from the cheese peptidome
   produced using Lactobacillus delbrueckii WS4 were screened for antiviral
   activity by employing the web tools, AVPpred, and meta-iAVP. Molecular
   docking studies of the selected peptides revealed one potential peptide
   ``KFVPKQPNMIL{''} that demonstrated strong affinity toward significant
   amino acid residues responsible for the host cell entry (RBD) and
   multiplication (3CL(pro)) of SARS-CoV-2. The peptide was also assessed
   for its ability to interact with the critical residues of S1 RBD and
   3CL(pro) of other beta-coronaviruses. High binding affinity was observed
   toward critical amino acids of both the targeted proteins in SARS-CoV,
   MERS-CoV, and HCoV-HKU1. The binding energy of KFVPKQPNMIL against RBD
   and 3CL(pro) of the four viruses ranged from -8.45 to -26.8 kcal/mol and
   -15.22 to -22.85 kcal/mol, respectively. The findings conclude that
   cheese, produced by using Lb. delbrueckii WS4, could be explored as a
   prophylactic food for SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses. In addition, the
   multi-target inhibitor peptide, which effectively inhibited both the
   viral proteins, could further be used as a terminus a quo for the in
   vitro and in vivo function against SARS-CoV-2.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC 11}},
Abstract = {{Among light-based free-space communication platforms, mid-infrared (MIR)
   light pertains to important applications in biomedical engineering,
   environmental monitoring, and remote sensing systems. Integrating MIR
   generation and reception in a network using two identical devices is
   vital for the miniaturization and simplification of MIR communications.
   However, conventional MIR emitters and receivers are not bidirectional
   due to intrinsic limitations of low performance and often require
   cryogenic cooling. Here, we demonstrate that macroscopic graphene fibres
   (GFs) assembled from weakly-coupled graphene layers allow
   room-temperature MIR detection and emission with megahertz modulation
   frequencies due to the persistence of photo-thermoelectric effect in
   millimeter-length and the ability to rapidly modulate gray-body
   radiation. Based on the dual-functionality of GFs, we set up a system
   that conducts bidirectional data transmission by switching modes between
   two identical GFs. The room-temperature operation of our systems and the
   potential to produce GFs on industrial textile-scale offer opportunities
   for simplified and wearable optical communications. Here, the authors
   design macroscopic multi-layered graphene fibres with light-emission and
   -detection dual functionality in the mid-infrared range, offering
   megahertz modulation frequencies and bidirectional data transmission
   operation.}},

Title = {{Reproductive technologies, female infertility, and the risk of
   imprinting-related disorders}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL EPIGENETICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 11}},
Abstract = {{Background Epidemiological studies suggest that singletons born from
   assisted reproductive technologies (ART) have a high risk of adverse
   perinatal outcomes, specifically for imprinting disorders. Because ART
   processes take place at times when epigenetic reprogramming/imprinting
   are occurring, there is concern that ART can affect genomic imprints.
   However, little is currently known about the risk of imprinting defects
   according to the type of ART or the type of underlying female
   infertility.
   From the French national health database, a cohort of 3,501,495
   singletons born over a 5-year period (2013-2017) following fresh embryo
   or frozen embryo transfers (fresh-ET or FET from in vitro
   fertilization), intrauterine insemination, or natural conception was
   followed up to early childhood. Based on clinical features, several
   syndromes/diseases involving imprinted genes were monitored. The effects
   of ART conception and the underlying cause of female infertility were
   assessed. Results Compared with infants conceived naturally, children
   born after fresh-ET had a higher prevalence of imprinting-related
   diseases, with an aOR of 1.43 {[}95\% CI 1.13-1.81, p = 0.003]. Namely,
   we observed an increased risk of neonatal diabetes mellitus (1.96 aOR
   {[}95\% CI 1.43-2.70], p < 0.001). There was an overall independent
   increase in risk of imprinting diseases for children with mothers
   diagnosed with endometriosis (1.38 aOR {[}95\% CI 1.06-1.80], p = 0.02).
   Young and advanced maternal age, primiparity, obesity, smoking, and
   history of high blood pressure or diabetes were also associated with
   high global risk. Conclusions This prospective epidemiological study
   showed that the risk of clinically diagnosed imprinting-related diseases
   is increased in children conceived after fresh embryo transfers or from
   mothers with endometriosis. The increased perturbations in genomic
   imprinting could be caused by controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and
   potentially endometriosis through the impairment of endometrial
   receptivity and placentation, leading to epigenetic feto-placental
   changes. Further studies are now needed to improve understanding of the
   underlying molecular mechanisms (i.e. genetic or epigenetic causes).}},

Abstract = {{The liver's cellular functions are sustained by a hierarchical,
   segmentally-organized vascular system. Additionally, liver lymphatic
   vessels are thought to drain to perihepatic lymph nodes. Surprisingly,
   while recent findings highlight the importance of organ-specific
   lymphatics, the functional anatomy of liver lymphatics has not been
   mapped out. In literature, no segmental or preferential lymphatic
   drainage patterns are known to exist. We employ a novel murine model of
   liver lymphangiography and in vivo microscopy to delineate the lymphatic
   drainage patterns of individual liver lobes. Our data from blue dye
   liver lymphangiography show preferential lymphatic drainage patterns:
   Right lobe mainly to hepatoduodenal ligament lymph node 1 (LN1); left
   lobe to hepatoduodenal ligament LN1+LN2 concurrently; median lobe showed
   a more variable LN1/LN2 drainage pattern with increased (sometimes
   exclusive) mediastinal thoracic lymph node involvement, indicating that
   part of the liver can drain directly to the mediastinum. Upon ferritin
   lymphangiography, we observed no functional communication between the
   lobar lymphatics. Altogether, these results show the existence of
   preferential lymphatic drainage patterns in the murine liver. Moreover,
   this drainage can occur directly to mediastinal lymph nodes and there is
   no interlobar lymphatic flow. Collectively, these data provide the first
   direct evidence that liver lymphatic drainage patterns follow segmental
   anatomy.}},

Abstract = {{The electrical energy system has attracted much attention from an
   increasingly diverse research community. Many theoretical predictions
   have been made, from scaling laws of fluctuations to propagation
   velocities of disturbances. However, to validate any theory, empirical
   data from large-scale power systems are necessary but are rarely shared
   openly. Here, we analyse an open database of measurements of electric
   power grid frequencies across 17 locations in 12 synchronous areas on
   three continents. The power grid frequency is of particular interest, as
   it indicates the balance of supply and demand and carries information on
   deterministic, stochastic, and control influences. We perform a broad
   analysis of the recorded data, compare different synchronous areas and
   validate a previously conjectured scaling law. Furthermore, we show how
   fluctuations change from local independent oscillations to a homogeneous
   bulk behaviour. Overall, the presented open database and analyses
   constitute a step towards more shared, collaborative energy research.
   Power grid frequencies mirror the state of the grid. Here, Rydin GorjAo
   et al. analyse measurements of power grid frequencies across areas and
   continents and uncover scaling laws of their fluctuations and
   spatio-temporal dynamics, which could aid the design, operation and
   control of power systems.}},

Title = {{The Effects of Displacing Sedentary Behavior With Two Distinct Patterns
   of Light Activity on Health Outcomes in Older Adults (Implications for
   COVID-19 Quarantine)}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 11}},
Abstract = {{Rationale: The COVID-19 pandemic is limiting outdoor and community-based
   activities, especially for older adults owing to the requirement for
   self-isolation, potentially increasing prolonged sedentary behavior
   (SB). Given a poor tolerance for intense exercise, SB displacement with
   light intensity physical activity (LIPA) is a promising health enhancing
   alternative. Therefore, the aims of this study were to investigate the
   effects of two different types of SB displacement on health outcomes in
   older adults and any differential impact of associated LIPA pattern.
   Method: 28 older women (age: 73 +/- 5 years, height: 1.60 +/- 0.07 m,
   weight: 67 +/- 10 kg, and BMI: 26.1 +/- 3.6 kg/m(2)) underwent overnight
   fasted dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) imaging, blood sampling,
   and functional assessments before being randomly allocated to one of two
   groups: (1) single continuous bout of 45-50 min LIPA daily (n = 14); or
   (2) SB fragmentation (SBF; similar to 48 min LIPA daily, 2 min LIPA for
   every 30 min of SB; n = 14). Compliance was systematically monitored
   using tri-axial accelerometery. All measures were taken at weeks 0 and
   8.
   Results: Physical behavior significantly altered (decreased SB/increased
   LIPA; p < 0.05) and to a similar extent in both groups. We observed a
   significant reduction in serum triglycerides {[}p = 0.045, effect size
   (x273;(2)(p)) = 0.15; SBF: -0.26 +/- 0.77 mmol/L, LIPA: -0.26 +/- 0.51
   mmol/L], improved 30 s sit-to-stand (STS) count (p = 0.002, eta(2)(p) =
   0.32, 2 +/- 3 STS) and speed (p = 0.009, eta(2)(p) = 0.35, -10 +/-
   33\%), as well as increased average handgrip strength (p = 0.001,
   \&eta(2)(p) = 0.45, 6 +/- 12\%), and gait speed (p = 0.005, \&eta(2)(p)
   = 0.27, 0.09 +/- 0.16 m/s) in both groups. Interestingly, SBF caused a
   greater increase in peak handgrip strength (8 +/- 14\%), compared to
   LIPA (2 +/- 10\%; p = 0.04, eta(2)(p) = 0.38).
   Conclusion: SB displacement induced significant improvements in fasting
   triglycerides, gait speed, as-well as STS endurance/speed in older
   women. Frequent vs. continuous SB displacement also caused greater
   increases in handgrip strength. While both SB displacement protocols
   display promise as efficacious home-based interventions for
   self-isolating older adults, our results would suggest a physical
   functioning advantage of the SBF protocol for certain outcomes.}},

Journal = {{EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION}},
Abstract = {{A diagnosis of congenital stricture of the vestibulo-vaginal fold was
   reached in an 11-year-old mare without previous reproductive records,
   during a breeding soundness examination. The mare had an annular
   stricture of the vestibule-vaginal fold that did not allow palpation or
   vaginoscopic visual examination of the anterior portion of the vagina.
   Endoscopic evaluation of both anterior and posterior portions of the
   vagina revealed a normal mucosa without scar tissue. Ultrasound
   examination of the cervix, uterus and ovaries did not reveal any other
   abnormality. The mare had a normal karyotype - 64 XX. Vestibulo-vaginal
   stricture or stenosis is a congenital anomaly that occurs when there is
   an incomplete perforation of the hymen or occurs in association with
   hypoplasia of the genital canal that results in the formation of an
   annular fibrotic stenosis at the vestibule-vaginal junction. To our
   knowledge, this is the first report of vestibulo-vaginal stricture in a
   mare with confirmed normal karyotype, 64,XX.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SUBSTANCE USE}},
Year = {{2021}},

Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{542-548}},
Month = {{SEP 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: A growing health concern is e-cigarette use among
   adolescents. Several correlates of this behavior have been elucidated,
   but few studies have examined whether sensation seeking is associated
   with e-cigarette use. The current study explores whether this
   personality dimension is related to e-cigarette use and whether the
   relationship is moderated by gender, race/ethnicity, or peer substance
   use.
   Methods: The analysis utilized data from 17,858 U.S. 8th - 10th grade
   students from the 2017 and 2018 Monitoring the Future (MTF) studies, who
   responded to questions about past 12-month e-cigarette use. The
   association with sensation seeking and four types of e-cigarette use -
   nicotine only, marijuana only, flavoring only, or nicotine and marijuana
   - was explored with a multinomial logistic regression model.
   Results: The results demonstrated that sensation seeking is positively
   associated with all four types of e-cigarette use, with a slightly
   stronger association with e-cigarette use involving marijuana. The
   associations were not moderated by gender, race/ethnicity, or peer
   substance use.
   Conclusions: The analysis suggested that sensation seeking consistently
   predicted several types of adolescent e-cigarette use. Research using
   longitudinal data and measures of e-cigarette use by family members and
   friends is needed, though, to better understand this association.}},

Title = {{Model Experimental Study on Stress Transfer and Redistribution in a Clay
   Landslide under Surcharge Load}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{DEC 11}},
Abstract = {{Stress transfer and redistribution always accompany with the evolution
   of landslides. However, previous literature studies have mainly focused
   on stages of stress variation, and far too little attention has been
   paid to detailed transfer and redistribution process analysis on stress
   variation. In this paper, a large-scale clay model slope with masonry
   slide bed and prefabricated cambered slip surface was constructed. Earth
   pressure cells were embedded into slip mass to monitor vertical and
   horizontal stresses in different parts of the test soils under the set
   load sequence. Stress transfer efficiency (STE) indicators based on
   qualified stress monitoring datasets (tested by Shapiro-Wilk method)
   were established to quantify the stress transfer process. Staged
   development of stress inside the clay slope was analyzed through
   extracting slopes of stress curves and limit loads. The stress
   redistribution process was analyzed using STE and deflection of stress
   isolines derived from numerical simulation. Moreover, to study the
   influence of loading position on stress variation, geometry partitioning
   has also been discussed. Results showed that vertical and horizontal
   stresses had different growth trends on both sides of 80 kN and 60 kN,
   respectively. Horizontal stress growth has two stages; vertical stress
   growth has two stages in soils close to slope surface and shear outlet,
   while there are three stages in other soils. Vertical stress transfer
   efficiency (VSTE) and horizontal stress transfer efficiency (HSTE) are
   recommended to quantify stress transfer and redistribution process.
   Based on VSTEs and HSTEs, the slip mass could be partitioned into three
   parts: loading zone, transfer zone, and free zone. Deflecting amplitudes
   of stress isolines were in consistency with the results revealed by
   STEs.}},

Title = {{Revisiting the past - novel insight into intraspecific molecular
   diversity and phylogeny of widespread Echinogammarus berilloni}},

Abstract = {{Echinogammarus berilloni (Catta, 1878) is a widespread and euryecious
   species, inhabiting large parts of Southwestern Europe. Additionally, it
   is recognized as one of the non-native and invasive species, increasing
   its range to Central Europe. Even though it is widely used as a model
   organism in a variety of ecological and ecotoxicological studies, its
   intraspecific molecular diversity has been overlooked. In this study,
   the publicly available genetic data reveal high level of intraspecific
   diversity, supporting presence of up to four phylogenetically distinct
   genetic lineages. Furthermore, the results indicate that the taxon is
   not monophyletic. The importance of considering its intraspecific
   diversity is discussed, highlighting the potential implications for
   future studies as well as the need for further detailed taxonomic
   studies.
   Echinogammarus berilloni (Catta, 1878) est une espece tres repandue et
   eurytope qui est presente dans une grande partie de l'Europe du
   Sud-Ouest. De plus, elle est reconnue comme l'une des especes non
   indigenes et envahissantes, qui augmente son aire de repartition en
   Europe centrale. Bien qu'il soit largement utilise comme organisme
   modele dans diverses etudes ecologiques et ecotoxicologiques, sa
   diversite moleculaire intraspecifique a ete negligee. Dans cette etude,
   les donnees genetiques accessibles au public revelent un niveau eleve de
   diversite intraspecifique, ce qui confirme la presence de jusqu'a quatre
   lignees genetiques phylogenetiquement distinctes. En outre, les
   resultats indiquent que le taxon n'est pas monophyletique. L'importance
   de prendre en compte sa diversite intraspecifique est discutee, en
   soulignant les implications potentielles pour les etudes futures ainsi

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel image enhancement model based on shock filter for
   image deblurring is proposed in three cases. For the weight of shock
   filter, the fractional-order derivative of initial blurry image is used.
   This fractional-order weight can be adjusted adaptively according to the
   gradient of blurred image. Compared with the traditional integer-order
   shock filter, the proposed model creates less staircase effect, whereas
   the enhancement and deblurring of the resulted images are efficiently
   good. Stability properties of the proposed method are studied
   theoretically, and also to show the validity of stability studies
   results, some numerical experiments are presented. The three cases of
   proposed method are compared with together and with other methods.
   Different test images are used to show the validity of these cases.
   Numerical experiments confirm the efficiency of these cases.}},

Title = {{High-resolution ex vivo NMR spectroscopy of human Z alpha(1)-antitrypsin}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 11}},
Abstract = {{Genetic mutations predispose the serine protease inhibitor alpha
   (1)-antitrypsin to misfolding and polymerisation within hepatocytes,
   causing liver disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This
   misfolding occurs via a transiently populated intermediate state, but
   our structural understanding of this process is limited by the
   instability of recombinant alpha (1)-antitrypsin variants in solution.
   Here we apply NMR spectroscopy to patient-derived samples of alpha
   (1)-antitrypsin at natural isotopic abundance to investigate the
   consequences of disease-causing mutations, and observe widespread
   chemical shift perturbations for methyl groups in Z AAT (E342K). By
   comparison with perturbations induced by binding of a small-molecule
   inhibitor of misfolding we conclude that they arise from rapid exchange
   between the native conformation and a well-populated intermediate state.
   The observation that this intermediate is stabilised by inhibitor
   binding suggests a paradoxical approach to the targeted treatment of
   protein misfolding disorders, wherein the stabilisation of
   disease-associated states provides selectivity while inhibiting further
   transitions along misfolding pathways. alpha (1)-Antitrypsin (AAT) is a
   52kDa serum glycoprotein, the misfolding and polymerisation of which is
   associated with COPD and liver disease. Here the authors demonstrate the
   use of high-resolution multidimensional solution-state NMR spectroscopy
   to characterise the structure and dynamics in solution of Z AAT purified
   directly from clinical patients.}},

Title = {{Temporal Effects of Different Vehicles on Wound Healing Potentials of
   Quercetin: Biochemical, Molecular, and Histopathological Approaches}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOWER EXTREMITY WOUNDS}},
Abstract = {{Development of novel drugs or formulations to accelerate the wound
   healing process is the need of current era. Quercetin (Q), a
   bioflavonoid, at 0.3\% concentration has showed some wound healing
   potential in our preliminary studies. The present study was aimed to
   explore the wound healing potential of 0.3\% quercetin formulated in 3
   different vehicles, that is, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; 10\%), ointment
   base, and corn oil. Ninety experimentally wounded rats were grouped in 6
   groups. The 0.3\% quercetin mixed with DMSO, ointment base, and corn oil
   was topically applied once daily for 21 days on the wounds of groups 2,
   4, and 6, respectively. DMSO, ointment base, and corn oil alone was
   applied similarly in groups 1, 3, and 5, respectively. Gross evaluation
   and wound contraction results revealed accelerated wound closure in all
   quercetin-treated groups. The mRNA expressions of vascular endothelial
   growth factor, transforming growth factor-beta(1), and interluekin-10
   were markedly upregulated in healing tissues of quercetin-treated
   groups. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha mRNA expression and protein levels
   were lowered by quercetin treatment. Quercetin-treated groups also
   showed increased activities of SOD (superoxide dismutase) and catalase,
   and levels of total thiols in wound tissues on day 7. Levels of
   superoxide anion radicals and malondialdehyde were markedly lower in
   quercetin-treated groups. Histologically, wound sections of
   quercetin-treated groups showed early dominance of fibroblasts,
   increased blood vessels, marked collagen deposition, and regenerated
   epithelial layer. The significant effects were more pronounced in
   ointment + Q group among all the quercetin-treated groups. In
   conclusion, 0.3\% quercetin mixed in ointment base produced the fastest
   and better wound healing in rats.}},

Journal = {{TRIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC 11}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundPregestational diabetes mellitus (PGDM) is associated with
   adverse pregnancy outcomes including increased rates of caesarean
   section birth, macrosomia, congenital malformation, prematurity,
   admission to the neonatal intensive care unit and stillbirth. As a
   result, there has been an increase in interventions to improve outcomes
   in both mother and infant. To date, meaningful comparisons between these
   studies are limited due to heterogeneity in outcome selection and
   reporting. The aim of this study is to develop a core outcome set (COS)
   for randomised controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of
   interventions for the treatment of pregnant women with PGDM.MethodsThe
   study consists of three steps. The first step is a systematic review of
   the literature to assess outcomes reported in randomised controlled
   trials assessing the effectiveness of interventions for the treatment of
   pregnant women with PGDM. The second step is a three round, online
   Delphi survey to prioritise these outcomes. In this step, stakeholders
   (including women with PGDM, healthcare workers, researchers and
   policymakers) will be asked to rank the importance of outcomes for
   inclusion in the COS using a 9-point Likert type scale. Outcomes that
   meet the inclusion criteria after completion of the Delphi surveys will
   be brought to the consensus meeting. The consensus meeting will be the
   third and final step, where the COS will be finalised. The consensus
   meeting will include members from each stakeholder group.DiscussionThis
   paper describes the process used to develop a COS for the reporting of
   studies evaluating the effectiveness of interventions in pregnant women
   with PGDM. The COS will enable greater comparison between and
   information synthesis across RCTs in the treatment of PGDM. In addition,
   this COS will also help improve trial reporting and minimise research
   waste by prioritising the collection and reporting of outcomes that
   matter to all relevant stakeholder groups.Trial registrationThis COS has
   been registered with the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials
   (COMET) initiative
   (http://www.comet-initiative.org/studies/details/1425) on the 4th of
   November 2019. The systematic review component of this study has also

Abstract = {{A significant challenge for managers of drinking water infrastructures
   is to make effective strategic decisions for assets with a long lifetime
   in an uncertain and changing environment. Water resources, which are
   part of the drinking water infrastructures, have a special position in
   this decision making process as they operate at the interface of the
   socio-technical and the socio-ecological subsystems: water resources are
   the input for the technical system, consisting of pipes and pumps that
   interact with different actors; and water resources can be seen as
   output from the ecological system which is influenced by environmental
   and political issues like climate change, drought and competing and
   changing uses of water and space. This paper discusses how to design the
   water resources in such a way that they function in the desired way at
   present, but that the design also fits an uncertain future as good as
   possible. To this extent, a framework was developed based upon the
   notion of resilience. Existing general design principles for
   socio-technical systems from literature were used as building blocks in
   the development of our water resources design principles (WR-DP)
   framework. Three key characteristics of water resources were
   distinguished in this framework: water quantity, water quality and the
   environmental impact of the water resources. In addition, we
   distinguished two dimensions that allowed us to explicitly describe all
   possible design principles: system scale and class. The first dimension,
   system scale, ranges from one water resource to a network of water
   resources. The second dimension, class, makes a distinction between
   social aspects and technical aspects. Application of the WR-DP framework
   in a case of a drinking water company in the Netherlands showed the
   usability of the framework.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Colon cancer remains one of the most commonly diagnosed
   cancers in Germany. Within the entity of metastatic colon cancer, there
   are substantial variances in tumor biology due to differing molecular
   tumor characteristics. The optimal combination and sequence of therapy
   remains a subject of discussion.
   Objectives. Currently available options for systemic treatment of
   metastasized colon cancer (chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies,
   immunotherapy) are described and the optimal combination and sequence of
   treatment are discussed.
   Materials and methods. Relevant clinical studies and expert
   recommendations are analyzed and currently ongoing clinical studies are
   discussed.
   Results. Taking into consideration molecular tumor characteristics
   (KRAS; NRAS; BRAF; microsatellite instability, MSI), monoclonal
   antibodies, immune checkpoint inhibitors and chemotherapeutic agents are
   available for the systemic treatment of metastasized colon cancer. The
   survival of patients with metastatic colon cancer can be significantly
   improved by the integration of targeted therapeutics.
   Conclusions. The survival of patients with metastatic colon cancer has
   continuously improved in recent years. The optimal combination and
   sequence of therapy is determined by molecular tumor characteristics and
   the therapeutic options available in subsequent treatment lines.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines how the policy of funded early years places for
   `disadvantaged' 2-year-olds (FNP) in England reconfigures spaces within
   early childhood and care (ECEC) in new ways of working with young
   children. Using practitioners' interview data from early years settings
   in London, this article uses Foucauldian technologies of governmentality
   to shed light on how FNP responds to the problem of `disadvantage' as
   new mobile modes of governance. The paper explores how practitioners
   reconfigure their established spaces to incorporate provision and
   practice suitable for 2-year-olds and the challenges practitioners face
   in implementing the policy. The analysis considers `space as assemblage'
   by focusing on three key themes: dividing spaces through split
   rationality, dividing practices through othering and the reconfiguration
   of established ways of working. The themes trace how policy-driven
   technologies re-interpret ECEC in narrow and alternative ways by making
   a set of practices possible, engendering new pedagogical relationships.
   This article highlights the complex conditions of (im)possibility for
   `doing' ECEC under austerity. When viewed in the broader context, policy
   reforms are increasingly reaching into ECEC as strategic spaces for new
   modes of governing, sustained by a global agenda in neoliberal education
   reforms.}},

Title = {{The Current Situation and Future Trend of Leukemia Mortality by Sex and

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 11}},
Abstract = {{Leukemia is one of the most common cancers. We conducted this study to
   comprehensively analyze the temporal trends of leukemia mortality during
   2003-2017 and project the trends until 2030. We extracted national-level
   data on annual leukemia mortality from China Health Statistics Yearbooks
   (2003-2017). We applied the Joinpoint regression model to assess
   leukemia mortality trends in urban and rural China by sex during
   2003-2017. We also produced sex-specific leukemia mortality using the
   adjusted Global Burden Disease (GBD) 2016 projection model. In urban
   areas, age-standardized leukemia mortality decreased significantly among
   females during 2003-2017 (APC = -0.9\%; 95\% CI: -1.7, -0.1\%). In rural
   areas, significant decreases of age-standardized leukemia mortality were
   both found among males (APC = -1.7\%; 95\% CI: -2.9, -0.5\%) and females
   (APC = -1.6\%; 95\% CI: -2.6, -0.7\%) from 2008 to 2017. Rural-urban and
   sex disparities of leukemia mortality will continue to exist until the
   year 2030. According to projection, the leukemia mortality rates of
   males and rural populations are higher than that of females and urban
   populations. In 2030, leukemia mortality is projected to decrease to
   3.03/100,000 and 3.33/100,000 among the males in urban and rural areas,
   respectively. In females, leukemia mortality will decrease to
   1.87/100,000 and 2.26/100,000 among urban and rural areas, respectively.
   Our study suggests that more precautionary measures to reduce leukemia
   mortality are need, and more attention should be paid to rural residents
   and males in primary prevention of leukemia in China.}},

Title = {{Parallel Spatial-Temporal Self-Attention CNN-Based Motor Imagery
   Classification for BCI}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{DEC 11}},
Abstract = {{Motor imagery (MI) electroencephalography (EEG) classification is an
   important part of the brain-computer interface (BCI), allowing people
   with mobility problems to communicate with the outside world via
   assistive devices. However, EEG decoding is a challenging task because
   of its complexity, dynamic nature, and low signal-to-noise ratio.
   Designing an end-to-end framework that fully extracts the high-level
   features of EEG signals remains a challenge. In this study, we present a
   parallel spatial-temporal self-attention-based convolutional neural
   network for four-class MI EEG signal classification. This study is the
   first to define a new spatial-temporal representation of raw EEG signals
   that uses the self-attention mechanism to extract distinguishable
   spatial-temporal features. Specifically, we use the spatial
   self-attention module to capture the spatial dependencies between the
   channels of MI EEG signals. This module updates each channel by
   aggregating features over all channels with a weighted summation, thus
   improving the classification accuracy and eliminating the artifacts
   caused by manual channel selection. Furthermore, the temporal
   self-attention module encodes the global temporal information into
   features for each sampling time step, so that the high-level temporal
   features of the MI EEG signals can be extracted in the time domain.
   Quantitative analysis shows that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
   methods for intra-subject and inter-subject classification,
   demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness. In terms of qualitative
   analysis, we perform a visual inspection of the new spatial-temporal
   representation estimated from the learned architecture. Finally, the
   proposed method is employed to realize control of drones based on EEG
   signal, verifying its feasibility in real-time applications.}},

Abstract = {{Standard single-exposure of calcein (CAL) was conducted on juvenile
   silver carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, to examine its effects on
   antioxidant enzyme levels and lipid peroxidation. Juveniles were exposed
   to different concentrations of CAL solutions (0, 100, 300, 500 and 700
   mg/L) for different immersion periods (12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hr).
   Increased glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase, glutamate-pyruvate
   transaminase and alkaline phosphatases activities were assumed to be due
   to CAL-induced hepatic damage, probably because of the high potential of
   CAL to accumulate in fish hepatopancreas. Higher CAL concentrations
   (>300 mg/L) and prolonged immersion periods (>48 hr) could lead to
   greater toxicity in juvenile silver carp and, to a certain degree,
   damage the gills and hepatopancreas. The antioxidant responses in the
   gills and hepatopancreas result in successful elimination of the excess
   CAL-induced reactive oxygen species for CAL exposure <= 24 hr. Our
   results confirmed that the toxic effects of CAL on antioxidant enzyme
   levels and lipid peroxidation in juvenile silver carp depended on both
   CAL concentrations and duration of exposure. Moreover, concentration of
   CAL solutions and the immersion period should be, respectively,
   restricted to <= 300 mg/L and <= 24 hr, when CAL is used for immersion
   marking juvenile silver carp.}},

Abstract = {{In the current adoptive T cell therapy, T cells from a patient are given
   back to that patient after ex vivo activation, expansion, or genetic
   manipulation. However, such strategy depends on the quality of the
   patient's T cells, sometimes leading to treatment failure. It would
   therefore be ideal to use allogeneic T cells as ``off-the-shelf' T
   cells. To this aim, we have been developing a strategy where potent
   tumor-antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are regenerated
   from T-cell-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (T-iPSCs). However,
   certain issues still remain that make it difficult to establish highly
   potent T-iPSCs: poor reprogramming efficiency of T cells into iPSCs and
   high variability in the differentiation capability of each T-iPSC clone.
   To expand the versatility of this approach, we thought of a method to
   produce iPSCs equivalent to T-iPSCs, namely, iPSCs transduced with
   exogenous T cell receptor (TCR) genes (TCR-iPSCs). To test this idea, we
   first cloned TCR genes from WT1-specific CTLs regenerated from T-iPSCs
   and then established WT1-TCR-iPSCs. We show that the regenerated CTLs
   from TCR-iPSCs exerted cytotoxic activity comparable to those from
   T-iPSCs against WT1 peptide-loaded cell line in in vitro model. These
   results collectively demonstrate the feasibility of the TCR-iPSC
   strategy.}},

Abstract = {{This communication is a summary of our measurements of cross sections
   and astrophysical S-factors for radiative proton capture on deuteron.
   The measurements are a part of a new program to study light-ion induced
   nuclear capture and inelastic scattering reactions relevant to
   nucleosynthesis and astrophysics. We are primarily interested in the
   capture reactions relevant to primordial or Big Bang Nucleosynthesis
   (BBN). Section 1 provides a brief and general overview of nuclear
   astrophysics and the primary experimental challenges in the measurements
   of cross sections and S-factors for reactions relevant to nuclear
   astrophysics. The next section discusses the significance of the
   d(p,gamma )3He reaction in context of BBN and the need for generating a
   more precise data in the relevant energy window. The subsequent section
   is devoted to the experiment and results of measurements of cross
   sections and astrophysical S-factors for the d(p,gamma )3He reaction at
   three new BBN energies. One salient features of the measurements is the
   use of large volume LaBr3:Ce scintillation detector for measurement of
   the capture gamma -rays. To the best of our knowledge, capture gamma
   -rays for this reaction had so far been measured with NaI(Tl) or HPGe
   detectors only. The detection efficiency of the detector has been
   measured experimentally for different monochromatic gamma -ray energies.
   In addition, realistic GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulations have been carried
   out to generate the response of the detector for gamma -ray energies of
   interest. The measured cross section and astrophysical S(E)-factor for
   the three incident proton energies are found to be in agreement with the
   overall trend of the global data set for the BBN region, reported in the
   literature. The measured S-factors are also found to be in agreement
   with recent microscopic calculations of Marcucci et al. (2016).}},

Journal = {{DATABASE-THE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL DATABASES AND CURATION}},

Abstract = {{Transcription factors (TFs) play a main role in transcriptional
   regulation of bacteria, as they regulate transcription of the genetic
   information encoded in DNA. Thus, the curation of the properties of
   these regulatory proteins is essential for a better understanding of
   transcriptional regulation. However, traditional manual curation of
   article collections to compile descriptions of TF properties takes
   significant time and effort due to the overwhelming amount of biomedical
   literature, which increases every day. The development of automatic
   approaches for knowledge extraction to assist curation is therefore
   critical. Here, we show an effective approach for knowledge extraction
   to assist curation of summaries describing bacterial TF properties based
   on an automatic text summarization strategy. We were able to recover
   automatically a median 77\% of the knowledge contained in manual
   summaries describing properties of 177 TFs of Escherichia coli K-12 by
   processing 5961 scientific articles. For 71\% of the TFs, our approach
   extracted new knowledge that can be used to expand manual descriptions.
   Furthermore, as we trained our predictive model with manual summaries of
   E. coli, we also generated summaries for 185 TFs of Salmonella enterica
   serovar Typhimurium from 3498 articles. According to the manual curation
   of 10 of these Salmonella typhimurium summaries, 96\% of their sentences
   contained relevant knowledge. Our results demonstrate the feasibility to
   assist manual curation to expand manual summaries with new knowledge
   automatically extracted and to create new summaries of bacteria for
   which these curation efforts do not exist.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 11}},
Abstract = {{Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) is a foodborne zoonotic pathogen that causes
   listeriosis with a mortality rate of 20-30\%. Serovar 4b and 1/2b
   isolates account for most of listeriosis outbreaks, however, no
   listeriosis vaccine is available for either prophylactic or therapeutic
   use. Here, we developed a triple-virulence-genes deletion vaccine
   strain, and evaluated its safety, immunogenicity, and cross-protective
   efficiency. The virulence of NTSN Delta actA/plcB/orfX was reduced
   794-folds compared with the parental strain. Additionally, it was
   completely eliminated in mice at day 7 post infection and no obvious
   pathological changes were observed in the organs of mice after
   prime-boost immunization for 23 days. These results proved that the
   safety of the Lm vaccine strain remarkably increased. More importantly,
   the NTSN Delta actA/plcB/orfX strain stimulated higher
   anti-Listeriolysin O (LLO) antibodies, induced significantly higher
   expression of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-17, and IL-6 than the control
   group, and afforded 100\% protection against serovar 4b and 1/2b
   challenges. Taken together, our research demonstrates that the
   triple-genes-deletion vaccine has high safety, can elicit strong Th1
   type immune response, and affords efficient cross-protection against two
   serovar Lm strains. It is a promising vaccine for prevention of
   listeriosis.}},

Title = {{Experiment of torsional response induced by the Q-delta resonance}},
Journal = {{STRUCTURAL DESIGN OF TALL AND SPECIAL BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Because of geometric nonlinearities, vibrations in two horizontal
   directions can generate a torsional moment that induces a torsional
   response, even in a structure with no eccentricity; we term this
   phenomenon Q-Delta effect. In this study, the torsional response caused
   by the Q-Delta resonance was investigated by performing a shaking table
   test that involves a single-layer symmetric specimen. The specimen was
   designed and fabricated by focusing on one of two resonance conditions.
   Its moment of inertia was adjustable by changing locations of weights,
   and the natural frequency in the torsional mode could be modified. We
   developed a numerical model of the specimen, in which the columns
   connected to the slab were integrated into an elastic Euler beam. It was
   confirmed that the torsional response increased near the predicted
   Q-Delta resonance point. In addition, the acceleration at the corner of
   the slab was significantly increased. The formulated equations of motion

Abstract = {{Background
   Perphenazine (PPZ) is a typical antipsychotic that is mainly
   administrated for the treatment of schizophrenia. Due to its highly
   lipophilic nature and extensive hepatic first-pass metabolism, its oral
   bioavailability is low (40\%).
   Objective
   The novel nanocarriers like solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) have been
   reported to be highly effective for improving the therapeutic effect of
   drugs. Therefore the main scope of the present investigation was the
   evaluation of in vivo characteristics of PPZ-SLN in terms of
   pharmacokinetic parameters and brain distribution.
   Methods
   The PPZ-SLN was prepared by the solvent-emulsification and evaporation
   method. The storage stability of PPZ-SLN and empty SLN powders was
   studied for 3 months. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies and brain
   distribution evaluations were performed following a single oral dose
   administration of PPZ and PPZ-SLN suspensions on male Wistar rats. An
   HPLC method was established and validated for the quantitative
   determination of PPZ in plasma and brain samples.
   Results
   The storage stability studies revealed the good storage stability of the
   both PPZ-SLN and empty SLN at 4 degrees C. Compared to PPZ suspension,
   the relative bioavailability and the brain distribution of PPZ-SLN were
   increased up to 2-fold and 16-fold, respectively. Mean residence time
   (MRT) and half-life (t(1/2)) of PPZ-SLN were significantly (p value <
   0.01) increased in both plasma and brain homogenate compared to PPZ
   suspension.
   Conclusion
   The significant improvement in the pharmacokinetic properties of PPZ
   following one oral dose indicates that SLN is a promising drug delivery
   system for PPZ and shows a high potential for successful brain delivery
   of this antipsychotic.}},

Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{4105-4115}},
Month = {{DEC 11}},
Abstract = {{Using the Richards' equation of saturated-unsaturated seepage, the
   commercial Multiphysics fmite element software COMSOL is adopted to
   deduce the governing equations of two boundary conditions with the pore
   water pressure as the control variable for the infiltration and seepage
   (overflow) boundary conditions in the rainfall infiltration problem of
   slope. Based on the two-dimensional soil column model and the published
   models, the value of the boundary coupling length scale L in the
   governing equation is discussed, and L equal to 0.001 m is found
   reasonable. A simple two-dimensional slope model is then established,
   and the governing equations of the above boundary conditions are applied
   to analyze the infiltration and seepage law of rainfall with different
   intensities (long and weak, short and strong). The results show that
   when the rainfall intensity is 4 mm /h, the actual infiltration rate is
   always equal to the rainfall intensity, and the water content of the
   surface soil has increased from 0.29 to 0.35. When rainfall lasts for 75
   h, the surface seepage occurs at the foot of the slope, the total
   infiltration amount of the study area at 200 his 39.068 m(3); when the
   rainfall intensity is 40 mm /h, the actual infiltration rate first
   equals the rainfall intensity, and then gradually decreases, and the
   water content of the surface soil increases from 0.29 to 0.415
   (saturated). When rainfall lasts for 4 h, the surface seepage occurs at
   the foot of the slope, the total infiltration of study area at 20 h is
   26.908 m(3), which is far less than the former. This conclusion is
   consistent with the existing rainfall infiltration law in slope, which
   further proves the reliability of the above boundary condition governing
   equations that provides a feasible method for the boundary condition
   problem in fmite element analysis of rainfall in slope.}},

Title = {{NKT cells promote both type 1 and type 2 inflammatory responses in a
   mouse model of liver fibrosis}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 11}},
Abstract = {{Sterile liver inflammation and fibrosis are associated with many liver
   disorders of different etiologies. Both type 1 and type 2 inflammatory
   responses have been reported to contribute to liver pathology. However,
   the mechanisms controlling the balance between these responses are
   largely unknown. Natural killer T (NKT) cells can be activated to
   rapidly secrete cytokines and chemokines associated with both type 1 and
   type 2 inflammatory responses. As these proteins have been reported to
   accumulate in different types of sterile liver inflammation, we
   hypothesized that these cells may play a role in this pathological
   process. We have found that a transgenic NKT (tgNKT) cell population
   produced in the immunodeficient 2,4 alpha beta NOD.Rag2(-/-) mice, but
   not in 2,4 alpha beta NOD.Rag2(+/-) control mice, promoted a type 1
   inflammatory response with engagement of the NOD-, LRR- and pyrin
   domain-containing protein-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. The induction of the
   type 1 inflammatory response was followed by an altered cytokine profile
   of the tgNKT cell population with a biased production of
   anti-inflammatory/profibrotic cytokines and development of liver
   fibrosis. These findings illustrate how the plasticity of NKT cells
   modulates the inflammatory response, suggesting a key role for the NKT
   cell population in the control of sterile liver inflammation.}},

Abstract = {{Despite pronounced associations of major histocompatibility complex
   (MHC) regions with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), causal variants
   underlying NPC pathogenesis remain elusive. Our large-scale
   comprehensive MHC region deep sequencing study of 5689 Hong Kong Chinese
   identifies eight independent NPC-associated signals and provides
   mechanistic insight for disrupted transcription factor binding, altering
   target gene transcription. Two novel protective variants, rs2517664
   (T-rs2517664=4.6\%, P=6.38x10(-21)) and rs117495548
   (G(rs117495548)=3.0\%, P=4.53x10(-13)), map near TRIM31 and
   TRIM39/TRIM39-RPP21; multiple independent protective signals map near
   HLA-B including a previously unreported variant, rs2523589
   (P=1.77x10(-36)). The rare HLA-B{*}07:05 allele (OR<0.015,
   P=5.83x10(-21)) is absent in NPC, but present in controls. The most
   prevalent haplotype lacks seven independent protective alleles (OR=1.56)
   and the one with additional Asian-specific susceptibility rs9391681
   allele (OR=2.66) significantly increased NPC risk. Importantly, this
   study provides new evidence implicating two non-human leukocyte antigen
   (HLA) genes, E3 ubiquitin ligases, TRIM31 and TRIM39, impacting innate
   immune responses, with NPC risk reduction, independent of classical HLA
   class I/II alleles. Here the authors report a major histocompatibility
   complex (MHC) association analysis for nasopharyngeal carcinoma in
   Chinese individuals from Hong Kong, finding 8 independent associated
   loci associated with lower risk for developing nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
   Two non-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes are E3 ubiquitin ligases,
   TRIM31 and TRIM39, having a role in the innate immune response and
   implicating the importance of host Epstein-Barr virus interactions in
   this cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Accumulation of the microtubule-associated protein tau is associated
   with Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD brain, tau is abnormally
   phosphorylated at many sites, and phosphorylation at Ser-262 and Ser-356
   plays critical roles in tau accumulation and toxicity. Microtubule
   affinity-regulating kinase 4 (MARK4) phosphorylates tau at those sites,
   and a double de novo mutation in the linker region of MARK4, Delta
   G316E317D, is associated with an elevated risk of AD. However, it
   remains unclear how this mutation affects phosphorylation, aggregation,
   and accumulation of tau and tau-induced neurodegeneration. Here, we
   report that MARK4(Delta G316E317D) increases the abundance of highly
   phosphorylated, insoluble tau species and exacerbates neurodegeneration
   via Ser-262/356-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Using transgenic
   Drosophila expressing human MARK4 (MARK4(wt)) or a mutant version of
   MARK4 (MARK4(Delta G316E317D)), we found that coexpression of MARK4(wt)
   and MARK4(Delta G316E317D) increased total tau levels and enhanced
   tau-induced neurodegeneration and that MARK4(Delta G316E317D) had more
   potent effects than MARK4(wt). Interestingly, the in vitro kinase
   activities of MARK4(wt) and MARK4(Delta G316E317D) were similar. When
   tau phosphorylation at Ser-262 and Ser-356 was blocked by alanine
   substitutions, MARK4(wt) did not promote tau accumulation or exacerbate
   neurodegeneration, whereas coexpression of MARK4(Delta G316E317D) did.
   Both MARK4(wt) and MARK4(Delta G316E317D) increased the levels of
   oligomeric forms of tau; however, only MARK4(Delta G316E317D) further
   increased the detergent insolubility of tau in vivo. Together, these
   findings suggest that MARK4(Delta G316E317D) increases tau levels and
   exacerbates tau toxicity via a novel gain-of-function mechanism and that
   modification in this region of MARK4 may affect disease pathogenesis.}},

Title = {{Association of Helicobacter bilis Infection with the Development of
   Colorectal Cancer}},
Journal = {{NUTRITION AND CANCER-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL}},
Abstract = {{The role of Helicobacter\_bilis (H.bilis) in the development of
   inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colitis-associated carcinogenesis
   (CAC) has seldom been investigated. We examined the abundance of H.bilis
   in 58 colorectal cancers (CRCs), 20 IBDs, 40 cases of normal colorectal
   mucosa (NCs), and 20 adenomas (ADs) by 16S rRNA fluorescence in situ
   hybridization (FISH). Number of CD4(+)CD45RB(+)T cell and expression of
   IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in these tissues was determined by
   immunofluorescence. The abundance of H.bilis was significantly higher in
   CRCs than that in IBDs (P = 0.006), ADs (P < 0.001) and NCs (P <
   0.0001). The abundance of H.bilis in IBDs was significantly higher than
   that in ADs (P = 0.013). Moreover, the average number of
   CD4(+)CD45RB(+)T cell was significantly higher in CRCs than that in IBDs
   (P = 0.017) and NCs (P = 0.009). In addition, there was a positive
   correlation between the H.bilis abundance and density of
   CD4(+)CD45RB(+)T cells in 30 colorectal tissues (P < 0.0001). The
   frequency of co-staining for CD4(+)CD45RB(+)T cells and IFN-gamma was
   significantly higher in H.bilis positive group than that in H.bilis
   negative group (P = 0.002). H.bilis may play a role in the initiation of
   IBD and CAC, possibly through promoting the transformation of T cells
   into CD4(+)CD45RB(+)T cells and increasing the expression of
   proinflammatory cytokines IFN-gamma.}},

   of the fragment mass distributions indicates that the decrease in TKE

Abstract = {{The Balkans are still an imprecisely defined and relatively unknown area
   in southeastern Europe. They are a historical-political term, often
   provoking negative associations that are synonymous with
   underdevelopment, backwardness, and primitiveness. This research is
   aimed primarily at exploring how the Balkans are perceived by students
   of geography in Zagreb and Maribor and what associations they provoke.
   It further seeks to investigate whether the Balkans are primarily a
   cognitive construct that is spatially determined on an individual level,
   based on an individual's own insights, attitudes, values, and other
   determinants. Therefore, a questionnaire survey regarding perceptions of
   the Balkans was conducted. The results indicate that the Balkans can be
   seen as a sort of vernacular anti-region: the kind from which states in
   or near its boundaries attempt to exclude themselves, while
   simultaneously trying to include their neighbors to the south and east.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Venetoclax is a selective orally active Bcl-2 protein inhibitor very
   recently approved by USFDA to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia and
   other hematological malignancies. Postmarketing surveillance of any drug
   depends on its acceptability based on risk to benefit ratio. When risk
   outweighs the benefits, withdrawal of an already marketed drug is
   warranted. Presence of impurity is the primary cause of increased risk
   in a drug substance or drug product. With the discovery of newer
   molecules, it is of great importance to establish advanced analytical
   techniques for quantification of the drugs as well as their related
   impurities to address the prospective regulatory queries even if it is
   already in the market. In this study, a quantitative analytical assay
   method has been developed and validated for quantification of venetoclax
   in presence of its degradation impurities. A stress study was performed
   to examine the stability of the drug in hydrolytic, oxidative,
   thermolytic and photolytic environments. Venetoclax was found to be
   prone to degradation in acidic hydrolytic and oxidative stress
   conditions. Three new degradation impurities have been identified and
   characterized with the help of LC-Q-TOF-MS with accurate mass
   measurement and their putative structures have been proposed.
   Furthermore, for the first time, a possible degradation pathway has been
   established with mechanistic explanation. Moreover, the analytical
   method developed in this study will be of immense help for routine
   analysis of quality control and stability study samples of venetoclax in
   industry and research laboratories.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To describe medication utilization patterns by pediatric
   inpatients with cancer during their last week of life.
   Methods This retrospective study used data from the Vizient Clinical
   Database/Resource Manager, a national compilation of clinical and
   resource use data from over 100 academic medical centers and affiliates.
   Patients (0-21 years) with malignancy who died during hospitalization
   (2010-2017) were included (N = 1659). Medications were categorized as
   opioid, benzodiazepine, gastrointestinal related, chemotherapy,
   anti-infectives, or vasopressors. Exposure to each group was ascertained
   for all patients at 1 week and 1 day prior to death. Factors associated
   with exposure were examined using generalized estimating equations, and
   summarized using adjusted odds ratios (aORs).
   Results Over the last week of life, there was increased use of opioids
   (76\% to 82\%, aOR = 1.55, P < .001) and benzodiazepines (53\% to 66\%,
   aOR = 1.36, P = .02), while gastrointestinal-related medication use
   decreased (92\% to 89\%, aOR = 0.69, P = .001). Patients had decreased
   exposure to chemotherapy (10\% to 5\%, aOR = 0.46, P < .001) and
   anti-infectives (82\% to 73\%, aOR = 0.41, P = .002). Vasopressor use
   increased as death approached (15\% to 28\%, aOR = 1.67, P = .04).
   Factors significantly associated with exposure varied with medication
   category, and included age, race, length of stay, malignancy type, death
   in the intensive care unit, history of hematopoietic stem cell
   transplant, and do-not-resuscitate status.
   Conclusion During the week preceding death, administration of symptom
   management medications increased for children with cancer, but use was
   not universal. Potentially life-sustaining medications were often
   continued. Variability in utilization suggests differences in
   provider/family decision making that warrant further study to develop an
   evidence-based approach to end-of-life care.}},

Journal = {{PSYCHOTHERAPY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{843-858}},
Month = {{OCT 3}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Recent years have seen a significant and rapid increase in
   the provision of tele-therapies. Chairwork methods such as empty-chair
   dialogues and role-play represent a ``common{''} category of therapeutic
   interventions which are utilized in many psychotherapeutic approaches.
   However, guidelines for facilitating chairwork in tele-therapy are
   currently lacking. The aim of this study was to survey expert providers
   regarding how chairwork is best provided in internet-delivered
   psychotherapy.
   Method: Forty one experts were recruited from a range of therapeutic
   backgrounds including cognitive behaviour therapy, compassion focused
   therapy, emotion focused therapy, psychodrama, schema therapy, and voice
   dialogue. Participants completed a brief questionnaire survey exploring
   the delivery of tele-chairwork. Responses were analysed using thematic
   analysis.
   Results: Five themes were identified: (i) divided opinion; (ii)
   convergence between therapy and home; (iii) disconnection and depth;
   (iv) practical impediments and benefits; and (v) revising and
   re-visioning chairwork. Overall, results indicate that chairwork can be
   successfully incorporated into tele-therapy, but requires adaption and
   special considerations.
   Discussion: Despite challenges, tele-chairwork appears to be a feasible
   method of psychotherapeutic intervention. Preliminary guidelines for
   initiating, facilitating, and concluding tele-chairwork are presented,
   alongside future directions for research.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{DEC 11}},
Abstract = {{In this work, the results of first-principles density-functional-theory
   calculations are used to construct the energy landscapes of HfO2 and its
   Y and Zr substituted derivatives as a function of symmetry-adapted
   lattice-mode amplitudes. These complex energy landscapes possess
   multiple local minima, corresponding to the tetragonal, oIII (Pca2(1)),
   and oIV (Pmn2(1)) phases. We find that the energy barrier between the
   nonpolar tetragonal phase and the ferroelectric oIII phase can be
   lowered by Y and Zr substitution. In Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 with an ordered cation
   arrangement, Zr substitution makes the oIV phase unstable, and it
   becomes an intermediate state in the tetragonal to oIII phase
   transition. Using these energy landscapes, we interpret the structural
   transformations and hysteresis loops computed for electric-field cycles
   with various choices of field direction. The implications of these
   results for interpreting experimental observations, such as the wake-up
   and split-up effects, are also discussed. These results and analysis
   deepen our understanding of the origin of ferroelectricity and field
   cycling behaviors in HfO2-based films and allow us to propose strategies
   for improving their functional properties.}},

Abstract = {{In the past ten years, Chinese people of different social strata have
   swarmed into the peer-to-peer (P2P) lending industry as lenders and

   desperate investors who lost their life savings on these lending
   platforms, many of which turned out to be Ponzi schemes. Based on
   fifteen months of fieldwork, this article presents a failed yet

   by observing how the aspirational public script of financial inclusion
   is maintained and experienced through a hidden technological script that
   alienates the notion of ``peer.{''} This article argues that the
   morality of the market is not only about ``seeing{''} and judging from a
   distance but also about ``feeling{''} and managing the moral boundaries
   and intersubjective distances between actors. These altered distances
   restructure interpersonal responsibilities and sustain the dreams and
   imagination that shape financial subjects on an unconscious level. The
   article expands the concept of market relationality beyond direct
   interactions between actors and uncovers the inherent tensions within
   the dream of financial inclusion. It examines the fantasy of beneficial
   technology in shaping market morality and the unintended consequences it
   produces.}},

Abstract = {{Background Despite strong evidence supporting the expansion of
   midwife-led unit provision, as a result of optimal maternal and
   perinatal outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and positive service user and
   staff experiences, scaling-up has been slow. Systemic barriers
   associated with gender, professional, economic, cultural, and social
   factors continue to constrain the expansion of midwifery as a public
   health intervention globally. This article aimed to explore
   relationships and trust as key components of a well-functioning
   freestanding midwifery unit (FMU).
   Method(s) A critical realist ethnographic study of an FMU located in
   East London, England, was conducted over a period of 15 months.
   Recruitment of the 82 participants was purposive. Data collection
   included participant observation and semi-structured interviews, and
   data were analyzed thematically along with relevant local guidelines and
   documents.
   Results Twelve themes emerged. Relationships and Trust were identified
   as a core theme. The other 11 themes were grouped into six families,
   three of which: Ownership, Autonomy, and Continuous Learning; Team
   Spirit, Interdependency, and Power Relations; and Salutogenesis will be
   covered in this paper. The remaining three families: Friendly
   Environment; Having Time and Mindfulness; and Social Capital, will be
   covered in a separate paper.
   Conclusions A relationship-based model of care was crucial for both the
   functioning of the FMU and service users' satisfaction and may offer a
   compelling response to high levels of stress and burnout among midwives.}},

   stress, anxiety, and depression. Data were collected by administering
   surveys in several online support groups for parents of children with

Abstract = {{Background and Aims The risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is
   increased in acute hepatic porphyrias (AHP). The aim of this study was
   to explore the clinicopathologic characteristics, outcomes, and
   frequency of HCC in patients with AHP in the United States.
   Approach and Results This cross-sectional analysis evaluated patients
   with HCC in a multicenter, longitudinal study of AHP. Among 327 patients
   with AHP, 5 (1.5\%) were diagnosed with HCC. Of the 5 HCC cases, 4 had
   acute intermittent porphyria and 1 had variegate porphyria, confirmed by
   biochemical and/or genetic testing. All patients were white females,
   with a median age of 27 years (range 21-75) at diagnosis. The median age
   at HCC diagnosis was 69 years (range 61-74). AHP was asymptomatic in 2
   patients; 2 reported sporadic attacks; and 1 reported recurrent attacks
   (>4 attacks/year). All patients had a single HCC lesion on liver imaging
   that was 1.8-6.5 centimeters in diameter. Serum alpha fetoprotein levels
   were below 10 ng/mL in all 4 patients with available results. Four
   patients underwent liver resection, and 1 was treated with
   radioembolization. No significant inflammation or fibrosis was found in
   adjacent liver tissues of 3 patients who underwent liver resection. Two
   patients developed recurrence of HCC at 22 and 26 months following liver
   resection. All patients are alive with survival times from HCC diagnosis
   ranging from 26-153 months.
   Conclusion In this U.S. study, 1.5\% of patients with AHP had HCC. HCC
   in AHP occurred in the absence of cirrhosis, which contrasts with other
   chronic liver diseases. Patients with AHP, regardless of clinical
   attacks, should be screened for HCC, beginning at age 50. The
   pathogenesis of hepatocarcinogenesis in AHP is unknown and needs further
   investigation.}},

Abstract = {{1.Four gallinacin (GAL) genes were assessed by Polymerase Chain
   Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) to
   characterise these genes in Fayoumi (F) and Rhode Island Red (R) breeds
   and their crosses of Rhode Island Red x Fayoumi (1/2R1/2F) and Fayoumi x
   Rhode Island Red (1/2F1/2R).
   2.Genes examined were GAL2, GAL3, GAL4 and GAL5. The molecular
   associations between the SNPs of the gallinacin genes and body weight,
   caecal bacterial count and the serum antibody titres of IgA, IgG and IgM
   were determined. In the R breed, the frequency of TC genotype was higher
   than TT and CC genotypes for the GAL3 gene. The GG genotype frequency
   was higher than AA and AG genotypes for the GAL4 gene in the other
   genetic groups, and the CA genotype frequency was higher than CC and AA
   genotypes in crosses for the GAL5 gene.
   3.In all populations, the frequency of the C allele was higher than the
   T allele for the GAL3 gene, the G allele was higher than the A allele
   for the GAL4 gene and the C allele was higher than the A allele for the
   GAL5 gene. The observed heterozygosity in R, 1/2R1/2F and 1/2F1/2R was
   0.476, 0.375 and 0.158 for the GAL3 gene, 0.458, 0.615 and 0.250 for the
   GAL4 gene and 0.053, 0.792 and 0.739 for the GAL5 gene, while the
   expected heterozygosities were 0.490, 0.430 and 0.145 for the GAL3 gene,
   0.430, 0.348 and 0.219 for the GAL4 gene and 0.229, 0.478 and 0.496 for
   the GAL5 gene, respectively.
   4.On a molecular level, the genotype TT was significantly higher for
   body weight than TC and CC genotypes in the GAL3 gene. Birds with the GG
   genotype had a significantly lower Salmonella typhimurium count than
   birds with AA genotype in the GAL4 gene. Birds with the genotype AA had
   higher significant body weights than those with CC and CA genotypes in
   the GAL5 gene.
   5.The results indicated that the GAL3, GAL4 and GAL5 genes are potential
   candidates for selection programmes to improve S. typhimurium resistance
   and body weight in chickens.}},

Abstract = {{In nucleotide excision repair, bulky DNA lesions such as UV-induced
   cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers are removed from the genome by concerted
   dual incisions bracketing the lesion, followed by gap filling and
   ligation. So far, two dual-incision patterns have been discovered: the
   prokaryotic type, which removes the damage in 11-13-nucleotide-long
   oligomers, and the eukaryotic type, which removes the damage in
   24-32-nucleotide-long oligomers. However, a recent study reported that
   the UvrC protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis removes damage in a
   manner analogous to yeast and humans in a 25-mer oligonucleotide arising
   from incisions at 15 nt from the 3 ` end and 9 nt from the 5 ` end
   flanking the damage. To test this model, we used the in vivo excision
   assay and the excision repair sequencing genome-wide repair mapping
   method developed in our laboratory to determine the repair pattern and
   genome-wide repair map of Mycobacterium smegmatis. We find that M.
   smegmatis, which possesses homologs of the Escherichia coli uvrA, uvrB,
   and uvrC genes, removes cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers from the genome in
   a manner identical to the prokaryotic pattern by incising 7 nt 5 ` and 3
   or 4 nt 3 ` to the photoproduct, and performs transcription-coupled
   repair in a manner similar to E. coli.}},

Abstract = {{Object: Follow-up evaluation of intracranial aneurysms treated by
   flow-diverting stents using MRI is challenging due to the presence of
   imaging artifacts. This study evaluated 3D T1-SPACE in combination with
   3D-TOF sequence for follow-up evaluation of intracranial aneurysms
   treated with Pipeline embolization devices.
   Methods: Forty patients with 53 intracranial aneurysms who were treated
   with Pipeline Embolization Devices from October 2018 to July 2019 were
   enrolled in this study. All patients were evaluated for aneurysm
   occlusion and stent patency 4 to 7 months post-treatment using 3D
   T1-SPACE sequence, 3D-TOF MRA, and DSA examinations.
   Results: With regards to aneurysm occlusion, the intermodality (DSA and
   3D-TOF MRA) agreement was good (kappa = 0.755). The specificity of
   3D-TOF MRA was 94.4\% (34/36), the sensitivity was 76.5\% (13/17), the
   total coincidence rate was 88.7\% (47/53). With regards to the patency
   of the stented arteries after PED treatment, 3D T1-SPACE sequence was
   more accurate compared to 3D-TOF MRA (Z = -6.283, P < 0.001), with a
   no-artifact rate of 95.7\% (44/46).
   Conclusions: 3D T1-SPACE sequence provides better image quality and
   higher accuracy for evaluating stented parent arteries compared to
   TOF-MRA. 3D-TOF MRA may be valuable in the evaluation of aneurysm
   occlusion. The combination of these two modalities may be used for
   long-term follow-up of intracranial aneurysms treated with Pipeline
   Embolization Devices.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigated the changes in the distribution and
   regulation of endogenous hormones in Phyllostachys edulis `Pachyloen'
   during bamboo shooting. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to
   measure the mass fractions of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), gibberellic
   acid (GA), zeatin riboside (ZR), and abscisic acid (ABA) in rhizomes,
   shoots, and maternal bamboo organs during shoot sprouting, shoot growth,
   and new-bamboo formation. Measurements were compared among bamboo parts
   and developmental periods. The overall mass fractions of IAA and ABA
   were significantly higher than those of ZR and GA, driven by differences
   among bamboo parts and developmental periods. The abundance of each
   endogenous hormone varied among bamboo parts and developmental periods.
   During bamboo shooting, ABA had the highest mass fraction in all bamboo
   parts sampled, followed by IAA, GA, and ZR. Among bamboo parts, rhizomes
   had more IAA, ZR, and GA than the other parts, but significantly less
   ABA. Winter shoots had higher ZR: IAA and GA: IAA ratios than rhizomes
   and maternal bamboo organs. During shoot growth, ABA was the most
   abundant hormone in rhizomes and maternal bamboo organs, followed by
   IAA, ZR, and GA. In contrast, IAA was the most abundant hormone in
   spring shoots, followed by ABA, ZR, and GA. Maternal bamboo organs had a
   significantly higher ZR: GA ratio, and significantly lower IAA: ABA, ZR:
   ABA, and GA: ABA ratios than rhizomes. Spring shoots had significantly
   higher IAA: ABA, ZR: ABA, and GA: ABA ratios than rhizomes and maternal
   bamboo organs; significantly higher ZR mass fractions, and ZR: GA and
   ZR: IAA ratios and significantly lower ABA mass fractions than rhizomes;
   and significantly higher GA: IAA ratio than maternal bamboo organs.
   During new-bamboo formation, ABA was the most abundant hormone in
   rhizomes, winter shoots, and maternal bamboo organs, followed by IAA,
   ZR, and GA. Maternal bamboo organs had significantly lower IAA mass
   fractions and significantly higher ABA mass fractions than rhizomes and
   new bamboo tissue. IAA and ABA abundances exhibited an inverse
   relationship in rhizomes and maternal bamboo organs. GA: ABA and GA: IAA
   ratios decreased gradually and other hormone ratios exhibited parabolic
   trends over the bamboo-shooting period, with the highest ratios observed
   in new bamboo tissues. Overall, the coordination or antagonism among
   endogenous hormones plays a key regulatory role in bamboo shoot growth.
   The formation of thick walls in P. edulis `Pachyloen', one of its major
   traits, may be partially attributed to the relatively high IAA and ZR
   and low GA mass fractions.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a new shrinkage prior on function spaces, called the
   functional horseshoe (fHS) prior, that encourages shrinkage toward
   parametric classes of functions. Unlike other shrinkage priors for
   parametric models, the fHS shrinkage acts on the shape of the function
   rather than inducing sparsity on model parameters. We study the efficacy
   of the proposed approach by showing an adaptive posterior concentration
   property on the function. We also demonstrate consistency of the model
   selection procedure that thresholds the shrinkage parameter of the fHS
   prior. We apply the fHS prior to nonparametric additive models and
   compare its performance with procedures based on the standard horseshoe
   prior and several penalized likelihood approaches. We find that the new
   procedure achieves smaller estimation error and more accurate model
   selection than other procedures in several simulated and real examples.
   for this article, which contain additional simulated and real data
   examples, MCMC diagnostics, and proofs of the theoretical results, are

Title = {{Applying graph database technology for analyzing perturbed co-expression

Journal = {{DATABASE-THE JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL DATABASES AND CURATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Month = {{DEC 11}},
Abstract = {{Graph representations provide an elegant solution to capture and analyze
   complex molecular mechanisms in the cell. Co-expression networks are
   undirected graph representations of transcriptional co-behavior
   indicating (co-)regulations, functional modules or even physical
   interactions between the corresponding gene products. The growing
   avalanche of available RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data fuels the
   construction of such networks, which are usually stored in relational
   databases like most other biological data. Inferring linkage by
   recursive multiple-join statements, however, is computationally
   expensive and complex to design in relational databases. In contrast,
   graph databases store and represent complex interconnected data as
   nodes, edges and properties, making it fast and intuitive to query and
   analyze relationships. While graph-based database technologies are on
   their way from a fringe domain to going mainstream, there are only a few
   studies reporting their application to biological data. We used the
   graph database management system Neo4j to store and analyze
   co-expression networks derived from RNAseq data from The Cancer Genome
   Atlas. Comparing co-expression in tumors versus healthy tissues in six
   cancer types revealed significant perturbation tracing back to erroneous
   or rewired gene regulation. Applying centrality, community detection and
   pathfinding graph algorithms uncovered the destruction or creation of
   central nodes, modules and relationships in co-expression networks of
   tumors. Given the speed, accuracy and straightforwardness of managing
   these densely connected networks, we conclude that graph databases are
   ready for entering the arena of biological data.}},

Title = {{Free-breathing radial imaging using a pilot-tone radiofrequency
   transmitter for detection of respiratory motion}},
Journal = {{MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{2672-2685}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To describe an approach for detection of respiratory signals
   using a transmitted radiofrequency (RF) reference signal called
   Pilot-Tone (PT) and to use the PT signal for creation of motion-resolved
   images based on 3D stack-of-stars imaging under free-breathing
   conditions.
   Methods: This work explores the use of a reference RF signal generated
   by a small RF transmitter, placed outside the MR bore. The reference
   signal is received in parallel to the MR signal during each readout.
   Because the received PT amplitude is modulated by the subject's
   breathing pattern, a respiratory signal can be obtained by detecting the
   strength of the received PT signal over time. The breathing-induced PT
   signal modulation can then be used for reconstructing motion-resolved
   images from free-breathing scans. The PT approach was tested in
   volunteers using a radial stackof-stars 3D gradient echo (GRE) sequence
   with golden-angle acquisition.
   Results: Respiratory signals derived from the proposed PT method were
   compared to signals from a respiratory cushion sensor and
   k-space-center-based self-navigation under different breathing
   conditions. Moreover, the accuracy was assessed using a modified
   acquisition scheme replacing the golden-angle scheme by a zero-angle
   acquisition. Incorporating the PT signal into eXtra-Dimensional (XD)
   motion-resolved reconstruction led to improved image quality and clearer
   anatomical depiction of the lung and liver compared to k-space-center
   signal and motion-averaged reconstruction, when binned into 6, 8, and 10
   motion states.
   Conclusion: PT is a novel concept for tracking respiratory motion. Its
   small dimension (8 cm), high sampling rate, and minimal interaction with
   the imaging scan offers great potential for resolving respiratory
   motion.}},

Abstract = {{PT150 is a clinical-stage molecule, taken orally, with a strong safety
   profile having completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials for its
   original use as an antidepressant. It has an active IND for COVID-19.
   Antiviral activities have been found for PT150 and other members of its
   class in a variety of virus families; thus, it was now tested against
   SARS-CoV-2 in human bronchial epithelial lining cells and showed
   effective 90\% inhibitory antiviral concentration (EC90) of 5.55 mu M.
   PT150 is a member of an extended platform of novel glucocorticoid
   receptor (GR) and androgen receptor (AR) modulating molecules. In vivo,
   their predominant net effect is one of systemic glucocorticoid
   antagonism, but they also show direct downregulation of AR and minor GR
   agonism at the cellular level. We hypothesize that anti-SARS-CoV-2
   activity depends in part on this AR downregulation through diminished
   TMPRSS2 expression and modulation of ACE2 activity. Given that
   hypercortisolemia is now suggested to be a significant co-factor for
   COVID-19 progression, we also postulate an additive role for its potent
   immunomodulatory effects through systemic antagonism of cortisol.}},

Abstract = {{From the first N 2 -metal complex discovered in the 1960s to the
   borylene N-2 complex reported very recently, chemists have been trying
   to activate N-2 under milder conditions by investigating many approaches
   or strategies. Among them, carbene species has been considered a good
   choice to construct N-C bond to obtain N-containing organic compounds
   directly. Since the first glimpse of the N-2 exchange of diazomethane,
   chemists have obtained a deeper understanding of the rebound reaction
   between carbene and N-2. This review mainly summarizes the progress in
   the field of N-2 fixation by using carbene species, both experimentally
   and theoretically. We believe this review will provide readers with an
   indepth understanding of the state-of-the-art and perspectives of future
   research particularly in the use of carbene species for activation and
   transformation of N-2 into N-C containing organic compounds. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{Aims To assess the pelvic floor function in cervical cancer patients
   after radical hysterectomy and its relationship with urinary
   incontinence (UI).
   Methods Cervical cancer patients who underwent radical hysterectomy were
   recruited from 18 hospitals in China from January 2012 to March 2015.
   Pelvic floor examinations were conducted by measuring the pelvic floor
   muscle strength, fatigue of pelvic floor muscle fatigue, dynamic
   pressure of vaginal, nerve injury, A3 feedback, muscle potential, static
   tension, and dynamic tension. Postoperative urinary incontinence (UI)
   was identified using the International Consultation on Incontinence
   Questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to
   assess the association of pelvic floor function examination results with
   postoperative UI.
   Results Totally 169 patients were included in this study. The prevalence
   of UI was 39.6\% (67/169). The proportion of abnormal fatigue of Type I
   muscle (64\% vs. 36\%, p = .04) and abnormal A3 feedback (53.9\% vs.
   46.1\%, p = .03) were higher among patients with postoperative UI
   compared to those without UI. In the multivariable analysis, abnormal
   fatigue of Type I muscle (odds ratio {[}OR] = 3.73, 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI]: 1.42-9.84), abnormal A3 feedback (OR = 2.40, 95\% CI:
   1.04-5.51), and length of resected vagina > 3 cm (OR = 3.44, 95\% CI:
   1.27-9.31) were associated with postoperative UI. Compared to
   laparoscopy, laparotomy was less likely to cause postoperative UI (OR =
   0.12, 95\% CI:0.04-0.33).
   Conclusions The abnormal function of the pelvic floor muscle is related
   to postoperative UI. Early assessment among these patients is needed to
   prevent the development of pelvic floor disorder postoperatively.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundThe outcomes of immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer
   patients with liver metastases are poor, which may be related to a
   different tumor microenvironment in liver metastases from primary
   tumors. This study was aimed to analyze PD-L1 expression and the immune
   microenvironment status in liver metastases and compare the differences
   of PD-L1 expression between primary tumors and liver metastases of
   colorectal cancer.Methods74 cases of pathologically confirmed colorectal
   cancer with liver metastasis underwent resection from our hospital were
   included. Tissue microarrays were used for the interpretation of PD-L1
   expression, cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) and CD8 density by
   immunohistochemistry. We evaluated the disparity between primary tumor
   and liver metastasis in PD-L1 expression, CD4 and CD8 density and
   analyzed the factors associated with obvious PD-L1 disparity.ResultsThe
   expression of PD-L1 was positively related to the density of CD4 and CD8
   in liver metastases. The expression of PD-L1 in liver metastases was
   higher than in primary tumors in certain subgroups, including patients
   with concurrent liver metastases (n=63, p=0.05), patients receiving
   concurrent resection of primary and metastatic tumors (n=56, p=0.04).
   The two subgroups generally reflected those without inconsistent
   external influences, such as treatment and temporal factors, between
   primary tumors and liver metastases. In these subgroups, the intrinsic
   differences of microenvironment between primary tumors and liver
   metastases could be identified. Furthermore, tumor differentiation
   {[}moderate vs. poor: OR=0.23, 95\% CI: 0.03-0.99, p=0.05)] were
   demonstrated to be associated with obvious discordance of PD-L1
   expression between primary tumors and liver metastases.ConclusionsThe
   expression of PD-L1 in liver metastases was higher than in primary
   tumors in subgroups, reflecting intrinsic microenvironment differences
   between primary and metastatic tumors. Obvious discordance of PD-L1

Abstract = {{Schools play a major role in delivering behavioral health services to
   autistic youth. School culture and climate are strong predictors of the
   extent to which these services incorporate evidence-based practices;
   however, little is known about how school leaders shape culture and

   mechanisms, we conducted a qualitative study to understand the ways in
   which school principals embed cultures and climates that support
   effective implementation of evidence-based practices for youth with
   autism. Semi-structured interviews with 32 teachers in schools that
   implemented three closely related evidence-based practices for youth
   with autism (discrete trial training, pivotal response training, and
   visual schedules) explored teachers' experiences regarding (a)
   implementation of the three evidence-based practices, (b) perceptions of
   school culture and climate, and (c) principals' behaviors, practices,
   and decisions that supported or detracted from the aspects of culture
   and climate that supported successful implementation. Thematic analysis
   detailed seven mechanisms that principals used to embed cultures and
   climates that shaped evidence-based practice implementation. These
   mechanisms represent actionable targets for school leaders and inform
   strategies to improve the implementation of evidence-based practices for
   youth with autism in schools.
   Lay abstract
   Schools play a major role in providing services to youth with autism;
   however, not all schools use evidence-based practices, defined as
   interventions that are proven to improve youth well-being through
   rigorous research. School culture and climate are strong predictors of
   whether or not a school uses evidence-based practices; however, little
   is known about how principals can create school cultures and climates
   that support the use of these practices. This study interviewed 32
   teachers in elementary schools that implemented three closely related
   evidence-based practices for youth with autism to better understand how
   principals create school cultures and climates that support effective
   services. Analysis of the teachers' responses identified seven
   strategies principals can use to create school cultures and climates
   that support the implementation of effective practices for youth with
   autism. The strategies include the following: (a) support teachers to
   obtain professional development focused on autism, (b) align performance
   expectations and evaluations with the needs of students with autism and
   evidence-based practice delivery, (c) allocate resources to ensure
   adequate staff, materials, and training are available to implement
   evidence-based practices, (d) be open and flexible to allow teachers to
   use the building and resources as needed to meet students' needs, (e)
   provide direct assistance, feedback, and coaching to troubleshoot
   challenges or involve outside experts to do so, (f) openly value the
   work of special education teachers and provide recognition to those who
   develop expertise in evidence-based practices, and (g) look for
   opportunities to integrate special and general education teachers and
   students to foster a truly inclusive climate.}},

Abstract = {{This cross-sectional study examines health care utilization and
   expenditures that are attributable to unauthorized immigrants vs
   authorized immigrants or US-born individuals.
   Question Do unauthorized immigrants have higher health care expenditures
   and utilization than authorized immigrants or US-born individuals?
   Findings This cross-sectional study used survey data from 47 199
   participants and machine learning modeling to predict expenditures and
   use among unauthorized and authorized immigrants and US-born
   individuals. Unauthorized immigrants had significantly fewer visits than
   US-born individuals across settings and were more likely to be
   uninsured; annual expenditures per person were \$1629 for unauthorized
   immigrants and \$3795 for authorized immigrants compared with \$6088 for
   US-born individuals. Meaning These findings suggest that unauthorized
   immigrants are not more likely to use health care and have fewer
   expenditures than authorized immigrants or US-born individuals.
   Importance Knowledge about use of health care services (health care
   utilization) and expenditures among unauthorized immigrant populations
   is uncertain because of limitations in ascertaining legal status in
   population data. Objective To examine health care utilization and
   expenditures that are attributable to unauthorized and authorized
   immigrants vs US-born individuals. Design, Setting, and Participants
   This cross-sectional study used the data on documentation status from
   the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey (LAFANS) to develop a
   random forest classifier machine learning model. K-fold cross-validation
   was used to test model performance. The LAFANS is a randomized,
   multilevel, in-person survey of households residing in Los Angeles
   County, California, consisting of 2 waves. Wave 1 began in April 2000
   and ended in January 2002, and wave 2 began in August 2006 and ended in
   December 2008. The machine learning model was then applied to a
   nationally representative database, the 2016-2017 Medical Expenditure
   Panel Survey (MEPS), to predict health care expenditures and utilization
   among unauthorized and authorized immigrants and US-born individuals. A
   generalized linear model analyzed health care expenditures. Logistic
   regression modeling estimated dichotomous use of emergency department
   (ED), inpatient, outpatient, and office-based physician visits by
   immigrant groups with adjusting for confounding factors. Data were
   analyzed from May 1, 2019, to October 14, 2020. Exposures Self-reported
   immigration status (US-born, authorized, and unauthorized status). Main
   Outcomes and Measures Annual health care expenditures per capita and use
   of ED, outpatient, inpatient, and office-based physician care. Results
   Of 47 199 MEPS respondents with nonmissing data, 35 079 (74.3\%) were US
   born, 10 816 (22.9\%) were authorized immigrants, and 1304 (2.8\%) were
   unauthorized immigrants (51.7\% female; mean age, 47.6 {[}95\% CI,
   47.4-47.8] years). Compared with authorized immigrants and US-born
   individuals, unauthorized immigrants were more likely to be aged 18 to
   44 years (80.8\%), Latino (96.3\%), and Spanish speaking (95.2\%) and to
   have less than 12 years of education (53.7\%). Half of unauthorized
   immigrants (47.1\%) were uninsured compared with 15.9\% of authorized
   immigrants and 6.0\% of US-born individuals. Mean annual health care
   expenditures per person were \$1629 (95\% CI, \$1330-\$1928) for
   unauthorized immigrants, \$3795 (95\% CI, \$3555-\$4035) for authorized
   immigrants, and \$6088 (95\% CI, \$5935-\$6242) for US-born individuals.
   Conclusions and Relevance Contrary to much political discourse in the
   US, this cross-sectional study found no evidence that unauthorized
   immigrants are a substantial economic burden on safety net facilities
   such as EDs. This study illustrates the value of machine learning in the
   study of unauthorized immigrants using large-scale, secondary databases.}},

Abstract = {{Existing dark tourism literature has explored various aspects of
   interpretation, including challenges in balancing interpretation efforts
   with concerns for historical accuracy, and managing ethical issues with
   interpreting past tragedies for packaged tourism purposes. However,
   research appears under-developed concerning the influences on the design
   of interpretation at dark visitor attractions, particularly those
   considered lighter due to their edutainment agenda. This paper thus
   critically explores the influences on the design of edutainment
   interpretation at three lighter dark visitor attractions, which are
   introduced as new attractions for study within dark tourism research. It
   also discusses the findings achieved that not only contribute to the
   study's conclusions and recommendations for future research in the
   realms of dark tourism and interpretation, but also contribute to
   enhancing interpretation design understanding for both dark tourism
   research and practice.}},

Title = {{Assessment of treatment options for patients with hepatitis C virus

Abstract = {{Aim Hepatitis C virus (HCV) intergenotype recombinant form (RF) 2k/1b
   has been actively circulating in HCV-infected patients, and the
   prevalence of this RF virus in the Republic of Georgia is one of the
   highest reported worldwide. The aim of this study was to define the
   optimal treatment regimen for patients with RF\_2k/1b.
   Methods We analyzed the data of 2735 patients who started treatment at
   the Medical Center Mrcheveli within Georgia's hepatitis C elimination
   program from May 2015 through December 2019. The patients were treated
   with sofosbuvir (SOF)-based regimens. For identification of RF\_2k/1b
   variants, refinement of standard (INNO-LiPA) genotyping results for all
   patient samples assigned the unspecific HCV genotypes (GT) 2a/2c was
   carried out by sequencing of core and non-structural protein 5B genes.
   Results Overall, 444 patients, representing 66\% of GT2 and 16\% of the
   total samples, were RF\_2k/1b. Treatment of patients with RF\_2k/1b with
   SOF/ledipasvir and SOF/velpatasvir was highly effective and viral cure
   rates did not differ among genotypes treated with the same regimen:
   RF\_2k/1b, 99\% (343/346); GT1, 99\% (876/885); GT2, 96\% (156/162); and
   GT3, 99\% (545/552). A separate comparison analysis of sustained
   virologic response rate, treated with SOF plus ribavirin, showed
   significantly higher sustained virologic response (96\%) in patients
   with confirmed GT2 (by sequencing) compared to unspecified GT2 (by
   INNO-LiPA) (79\%) (P < 0.05).
   Conclusion Sofosbuvir-based regimens are highly effective for treatment
   of RF 2k/1b patients, and with availability of new pan-genotypic
   direct-acting antivirals, genotyping to identify RF 2k/1b patients might
   not be necessary.}},

Month = {{DEC 11}},
Abstract = {{A wafer-scale fabrication method for isolated silicon quantum dots (Si
   QDs) using standard CMOS technology is presented. Reactive ion etching
   was performed on the device layer of a silicon-on-insulator wafer,
   creating nano-sized silicon islands. Subsequently, the wafer was
   annealed at 1100 degrees C for 1 h in an atmosphere of 5\% H(2)in Ar,
   forming a thin oxide passivating layer due to trace amounts of oxygen.
   Isolated Si QDs covering large areas (similar to mm(2)) were revealed by
   photoluminescence (PL) measurements. The emission energies of such Si
   QDs can span over a broad range, from 1.3 to 2.0 eV and each dot is
   typically characterized by a single emission line at low temperatures.
   Most of the Si QDs exhibited a high degree of linear polarization along
   Si crystallographic directions {[}110] abd {[}(1) over bar 10]. In
   addition, system resolution-limited (250 mu eV) PL linewidths (full
   width at half maximum) were measured for several Si QDs at 10 K, with no
   clear correlation between emission energy and polarization. The initial
   part of PL decays was measured at room temperature for such
   oxide-embedded Si QDs, approximately several microseconds long. By
   providing direct access to a broad size range of isolated Si QDs on a
   wafer, this technique paves the way for the future fabrication of
   photonic structures with Si QDs, which can potentially be used as
   single-photon sources with a long coherence length.}},

Abstract = {{Pectin has recently attracted increasing attention for biomedical and
   pharmaceutical applications. Due to the lack of adhesion molecules in
   polysaccharides, phenolic hydroxyl conjugated gelatin was added to
   enzymatically-gellable peroxidase-modified pectin derivative and
   compared with phenolic hydroxyl -pectin/collagen. Both pectin and
   gelatin were modified by tyramine hydrochloride in the presence of
   EDC/NHS. The phenolic hydroxyl -pectin/phenolic hydroxyl -gelatin,
   phenolic hydroxyl-pectin/collagen, and phenolic hydroxyl -pectin
   hydrogels were prepared using horseradish peroxidase and hydrogen
   peroxide(.) The hydrogels were characterized by gelation time analysis.
   Morphology, enzymatic biodegradation, mechanical and swelling properties
   as well as water vapor transmission rate were also evaluated.
   Fibroblasts were cultured for 7 days, and the survival rate was
   evaluated using conventional MTT assay. Hydrogels composed of
   Ph-pectin/Ph-gelatin showed decreased biodegradation rate, and WVTR and
   further improved mechanical performance in comparison with other groups.
   Both phenolic hydroxyl -pectin/collagen and phenolic hydroxyl
   -pectin/phenolic hydroxyl -gelatin hydrogels exhibited porous
   structures. The hydrogels composed of collagen promoted cell survival
   rate 1.4 and 3.5 times compared to phenolic hydroxyl -gelatin and
   phenolic hydroxyl -pectin based hydrogels at the end of 7 days,
   respectively (p < 0.001). The study demonstrated the potential of
   enzymatically-gellable pectin-based hydrogels as cost-effective

Abstract = {{In this paper, the bit error rate (BER) analyses of M-ary offset QAM for
   filter bank-based multicarrier (M-ary OQAM/FBMC) contaminated by

   scenarios, such as unshadowed line-of-sight (LOS) Rician K-factor (RK-f)
   fading channel, non-line-of-sight (NLOS) kappa-mu shadowed fading model
   and compound unshadowed/shadowed fading model. NLDs produced by high
   power amplifier (HPA) play the main role in the degradation of the BER
   in multicarrier communication systems over fading channels. Therefore,
   the complex Gaussian noise and the complex NLD are modelled as an
   independent parameter by using Bussgang's theorem. In this work,
   closed-form of BER, ergodic capacity, outage probability and outage
   capacity probability expressions for the M-ary OQAM/FBMC system over
   different unshadowed/shadowed fading channel scenarios and environments
   with amplitude (AM) and phase (PM) distortion induced by the HPA have

Title = {{Solar-Driven Fixation of Bismuth Oxyhalides on Reduced Graphene Oxide
   for Efficient Sunlight-Responsive Immobilized Photocatalytic Systems}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Developing green, cheap technology for large-scale production of
   photocatalysts in colloidal dispersion form enables the fabrication of
   efficient sunlight-responsive immobilized photocatalytic systems to
   address current environmental issues. It is reported for the first time,
   a cost-effective, energy-efficient, green, single-step approach for
   solar-driven fixation of bismuth oxybromideiodied solid solution
   (BiOBr0.75 I-0.25 SS) on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets by solar
   light irradiation of BiOBr0.75I0.25-graphene oxide (GO) dispersion in
   ethanol medium. Upon solar irradiation, GO is photocatalytically reduced
   by BiOBr0.75I0.25, resulting in uniform fixation of BiOBr0.75I0.25 SS on
   rGO to yield high-purity BiOBr0.75I0.25-rGO heterojunction
   (BiOBr0.75I0.25-rGO HJ) in colloidal dispersion form. The solar-driven
   fixation of BiOBr0.75I0.25 SS on rGO brings many favorable
   characteristics for BiOBr0.75I0.25-rGO HJ as sunlight-responsive
   photocatalyst over the pristine BiOBr0.75I0.25, including high
   absorption of light in the visible region, high electron-hole separation
   efficiency, and super adhesive property. As a result, BiOBr0.75I0.25-rGO
   HJ films exhibit super durability and outstanding photocatalytic
   performance for water decontamination over BiOBr0.75I0.25 films under
   the same conditions. This study is an establishment of a green strategy
   for the large-scale production of rGO-based bismuth oxyhalides HJs.}},

Abstract = {{Teacher self-efficacy has been abundantly studied. However, it seems
   that the consequences of teachers' self-efficacy have not been
   appropriately explored yet. The research objective was to investigate
   the consequences of teachers' teaching self-efficacy. The researchers
   used a qualitative research method. They collected the data through
   semi-structured interviews with 20 EFL teachers who were selected
   through purposive sampling. The interviews were content analyzed
   thematically. Findings showed that self-efficacy has different
   consequences: pedagogical, learner-related, and psychological. Each
   consequence has several sub-categories. It is concluded that high
   self-efficacy affects teachers' teaching practices, learners'
   motivation, and achievement. It also affects teachers' burn-out status,
   psychological being, as well as their job satisfaction. The findings can
   be theoretically and pedagogically important to EFL teachers,
   teacher-trainers, and administrators of educational settings.}},

   many realizations of this theory, as we illustrate in detail in a

Title = {{Asymmetric Information on Price Can Affect Bertrand Duopoly Players with
   the Gradient-Based Mechanism}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{We study a Bertrand duopoly game in which firms adopt a gradient-based
   mechanism to update their prices. In this competition, one of the firms
   knows somehow the price adopted by the other firm next time step. Such
   asymmetric information of the market price possessed by one firm gives
   interesting results about its stability in the market. Under such
   information, we use the bounded rationality mechanism to build the model
   describing the game at hand. We calculate the equilibrium points of the
   game and study their stabilities. Using different sets of parameter
   values, we show that the interior equilibrium point can be destabilized
   through flip and Neimark-Sacker bifurcations. We compare the region of
   stability of the proposed model with a classical Bertrand model without
   asymmetric information. The results show that the proposed game's map is
   noninvertible with type Z(0)-Z(2) or Z(1)-Z(3), while the classical
   model is of type Z(0)-Z(2) only. This explains the quite complicated
   basins of attraction given for the proposed map.}},

Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{283-300}},

Abstract = {{Based on the conservation of resources theory, we argue that work
   engagement involves resource investment, and therefore physiologically
   depletes resources. On this basis, we propose that work engagement
   accompanies high sympathetic arousal at the within- and the
   between-person levels, i.e. a negative objective health effect contrary
   to previous findings of beneficial effects on subjective psychological
   outcomes. To test our hypotheses, we examined heart rate variability via
   ambulatory assessment of 118 public office employees across five
   workdays. We measured daily work engagement at the end of each workday
   and calculated low frequency normalised and low to high frequency ratio
   (indicators of sympathetic activation) for work, leisure, and sleeping
   times of each day. As assumed, multilevel analyses showed a positive
   relationship between work engagement and sympathetic activation at work,
   during leisure, and sleeping time at the between-person level. Our
   hypotheses concerning the within-person associations were not supported.
   Thus, elevated work engagement over one workweek is associated with
   higher sympathetic activation, which is discussed to be a health risk.}},

Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Synthesis and assembly of ribosomal components are fundamental cellular
   processes and generally well-conserved within the main groups of
   organisms. Yet, provocative variations to the general schemes exist. We
   have discovered an unusual processing pathway of pre-rRNA in extreme
   thermophilic archaea exemplified by Pyrococcus furiosus. The large
   subunit (LSU) rRNA is produced as a circularly permuted form through
   circularization followed by excision of Helix 98. As a consequence, the
   terminal domain VII that comprise the binding site for the signal
   recognition particle is appended to the 5 ` end of the LSU rRNA that
   instead terminates in Domain VI carrying the Sarcin-Ricin Loop, the
   primary interaction site with the translational GTPases. To our
   knowledge, this is the first example of a true post-transcriptional
   circular permutation of a main functional molecule and the first example
   of rRNA fragmentation in archaea.}},

Title = {{Outcomes of Concurrent Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery and

Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RHINOLOGY \& ALLERGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Introduction
   Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and functional nasal airway obstruction are
   common but distinct medical problems which affect quality of life. In
   certain instances, patients often benefit from concomitant functional
   septorhinoplasty, or elect for cosmetic rhinoplasty, in addition to
   functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) and prefer combining
   procedures. Determining outcomes of combined surgery is important when
   discussing risks and benefits with patients.
   Methods
   A thorough literature search of articles published in PubMed, Ovid
   MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases. Patients were categorized as either
   having FESS or rhinoplasty alone or combined. Binary random-effects
   models were applied to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for outcomes
   including complications, recurrence, and satisfaction.
   Results
   Of the 55 screened articles, 6 were included in the analysis, and of
   these, 6 (405 patients), 2 (90 patients), 4 (290 patients), and 3 (190
   patients) provided data for postoperative complications, recurrence of
   CRS symptoms, revision rates, and patient satisfaction, respectively.
   Major complications were observed in 11 (5.8\%) total combined cases, 0
   (0\%) FESS cases, and 6 (3.5\%) rhinoplasty cases with no statistical
   difference between combined cases and rhinoplasties (OR 1.37, 95\% CI
   0.45-4.16, p = 0.58). Recurrence of CRS symptoms was noted in 35.6\%
   combined cases and 28.9\% FESS cases (OR 1.42, 95\% CI 0.55-3.64, p =
   0.47). There was no observed difference in revision rates between
   combined and isolated rhinoplasties (OR 1.00, 95\% CI 0.43-2.32, p = 1).
   Lastly, 91.6\% of patients were satisfied with results of combined cases
   compared to 87.4\% of patients in standalone cases (OR 1.57, 95\% CI
   0.61-4.03, p = 0.35).
   Conclusion
   Aggregate evidence demonstrates similar risk in complication rates in
   combined surgical cases compared to stand-alone rhinoplasty. There

Abstract = {{Systematic measurements of the magnetic moment of hexagonal 6H-BaTiO3-
   0.04 BaO ? x NiO (0.005 <= x <= 0.02) ceramics were performed to study
   the influence of Ni ions on the magnetic properties. By
   temperature-dependent measurements of the paramagnetic susceptibility at
   90 kOe, the Ni2+ ion was identified as the majority defect in
   air-sintered Ni-doped hexagonal barium titanate. Q-band EPR
   investigations of a 2.0 mol\% Ni-doped single crystal revealed three
   different Ni centers located at Ti sites: first, Ni3+ ions at Ti sites
   in intact oxygen octahedra, second, Ni3+ associated with an oxygen
   vacancy and third, the presence of Ni2+ centers leading to a forbidden
   transition. The Ni3+-VO associate characterized by a vacancy in the
   face-sharing oxygen plane of the oxygen octahedra can be ruled out. The

Title = {{Implementation of Ion Exchange Processes for Carbon Dioxide
   Mineralization Using Industrial Waste Streams}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Sequestration of CO2 within stable mineral carbonates (e.g., CaCO3)
   represents an attractive emission reduction strategy because it offers a
   leakage-free alternative to geological storage of CO2 in an
   environmentally benign form. However, the pH of aqueous streams
   equilibrated with gaseous streams containing CO2 (pH < 4) are typically
   lower than that which is required for carbonate precipitation (pH > 8).
   Traditionally, alkalinity is provided by a stoichiometric reagent (e.g.,
   NaOH) which renders these processes environmentally hazardous and
   economically unfeasible. This work investigates the use of regenerable
   ion-exchange materials to induce alkalinity in CO2-saturated aqueous
   solutions such that the pH shift required for mineralization occurs
   without the need for stoichiometric reagents. Na+-H+ exchange isotherms
   (at {[}H+] = 10(-8)-10(-1) M) and rates were measured for 13X and 4A
   zeolites and TP-207 and TP-260 organic exchange resins in batch
   equilibrium and fixed-bed exchange experiments, respectively. At
   solutions equilibrated with CO2 at 1.0 atm (pH = 3.9), H+ exchange
   capacities for the materials were similar (1.7-2.4 mmol H+/g material)
   and resulted in pH increases from 3.9 to greater than 8.0.
   Multi-component mixtures using Ca2+ and Mg2+ cations (at 10(-3)-10(-1)
   M) in CO2-saturated water were used to probe competitive ion exchange.
   The presence of divalent cations in solution inhibited H+ exchange,
   reducing capacities to as low as 0.2 mmol H+/g for both resins and
   zeolites. Dynamic H+ exchange capacities in fixed-bed ion exchange
   columns were similar to equilibrium values for resins (similar to 1.5
   mmol/g) and zeolites (similar to 0.8 mmol/g) using inlet solutions that
   were equilibrated with gaseous streams of CO2 at 1.0 atm. However,
   exchange kinetics were limited by intraparticle diffusion as indicated
   by the increased rate parameters with increasing inlet flow rates
   (20-160 cm(3) min(-1)). Experimental calcite precipitation from mixing
   the alkaline CO32--rich water solution obtained from the ion-exchange
   column with a simulated liquid waste stream solution achieved
   thermodynamic maximum yields. The results from these studies indicate
   that ion exchange processes can be used as an alternative to the
   addition of stoichiometric bases to induce alkalinity for the
   precipitation of CaCO3, thereby opening a pathway toward sustainable and
   economic mineralization processes.}},

Title = {{Treatment of real domestic sewage in a pilot-scale aerobic granular

Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{93}},

Abstract = {{Aerobic granular sludge (AGS) has been considered a breakthrough in the
   wastewater treatment sector given its key characteristics, such as
   excellent settleability, simultaneous removal of organic and nutrient
   pollutants, and compactness. However, the formation of granules often
   delays the start-up of granular-based systems, especially in large-scale
   settings. This study addressed the start-up of a pilot-scale AGS
   sequencing batch reactor (SBR) treating domestic sewage, monitored for
   over 280 days. The challenges faced during aerobic granulation using a
   mixture of activated sludge and anaerobic granular sludge as inoculum
   and the performance of the reactor on organic matter, nitrogen, and
   phosphorus removal were discussed. Results showed that robust and stable
   granules were formed after an initial period of around six months, with
   the settling time playing a key role on granules development. At least
   80\% of granules had a diameter greater than 0.2 mm and 60\% >1 mm. In
   general, the reactor achieved high nitrogen removal efficiency, as well
   as satisfactory removal of soluble COD. However, total COD abatement was
   impaired by the various episodes of suspended solids loss with the
   effluent. Overall, this study demonstrated that the reactor was
   efficient in the treatment of domestic sewage, but its performance was
   adversely affected from sudden changes in the influent quality.
   Practitioner points
   Aerobic granular sludge (AGS) applied to small-scale domestic sewage
   treatment.
   The control of sludge age in AGS can be a problem due to short
   sedimentation times.
   High DO to maintain aerobic granulation can economically make the
   process economically unfeasible in tropical countries.
   A sludge with excellent sedimentation properties was obtained. However,
   maintaining the granule over time is a challenge.}},

   asphalt for high-performance recycling}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{276}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{The regeneration and reusing of reclaimed asphalt mixture can promote
   the recycling of waste building materials and the sustainable
   development of asphalt pavement. To further improve the properties of
   rejuvenated SBS modified asphalt, the effects of structural changes of
   SBS, and the colloidal stability of asphalt on the properties of binder
   were studied. And based on the results, bio-rejuvenator and active
   rejuvenator were applied to rejuvenate ultraviolet aged SBS modified
   asphalt (USMA), the impacts of rejuvenators on the composition,
   structure, physical and rheological properties of USMA were
   systematically investigated. The results show the decrease of colloidal
   index and the damage of SBS structure all have a serious adverse
   influence on the properties of binder. Bio-rejuvenator can rebalance the
   colloidal stability of ultraviolet (UV) aged binders, meanwhile active
   rejuvenator could react with the active terminal groups of broken SBS
   segments and partially rebuilds its crosslinking structure. And the
   physical and rheological properties of UV aged asphalt can be all
   basically restored by adding bio-rejuvenator; however bio-rejuvenator
   cannot restore the properties of USMA, which can only improve the
   low-temperature performance of USMA. While the addition of active
   rejuvenator greatly enhances the high-temperature performance of
   rejuvenated SBS modified asphalt. Furthermore, the combination of
   bio-rejuvenator and active rejuvenator can both recover the colloidal
   structure and damaged SBS structure of USMA, which obviously improves
   its high- and low-temperature properties overall. This paper would
   contribute to the realization of high-quality regeneration of reclaimed
   SBS modified asphalt. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Identification of Novel MeCP2 Cancer-Associated Target Genes and

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Abnormal regulation of DNA methylation and its readers has been
   associated with a wide range of cellular dysfunction. Disruption of the
   normal function of DNA methylation readers contributes to cancer
   progression, neurodevelopmental disorders, autoimmune disease and other
   pathologies. One reader of DNA methylation known to be especially
   important is MeCP2. It acts a bridge and connects DNA methylation with
   histone modifications and regulates many gene targets contributing to
   various diseases; however, much remains unknown about how it contributes
   to cancer malignancy. We and others previously described novel MeCP2
   post-translational regulation. We set out to test the hypothesis that
   MeCP2 would regulate novel genes linked with tumorigenesis and that
   MeCP2 is subject to additional post-translational regulation not
   previously identified. Herein we report novel genes bound and regulated
   by MeCP2 through MeCP2 ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses in two breast
   cancer cell lines representing different breast cancer subtypes. Through
   genomics analyses, we localize MeCP2 to novel gene targets and further
   define the full range of gene targets within breast cancer cell lines.
   We also further examine the scope of clinical and pre-clinical lysine
   deacetylase inhibitors (KDACi) that regulate MeCP2 post-translationally.
   Through proteomics analyses, we identify many additional novel
   acetylation sites, nine of which are mutated in Rett Syndrome. Our study
   provides important new insight into downstream targets of MeCP2 and
   provide the first comprehensive map of novel sites of acetylation
   associated with both pre-clinical and FDA-approved KDACi used in the
   clinic. This report examines a critical reader of DNA methylation and
   has important implications for understanding MeCP2 regulation in cancer
   models and identifying novel molecular targets associated with
   epigenetic therapies.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrothermal dolomitization is an important diagenetic process that
   occurs in tectonic environments worldwide and forms conventional
   reservoirs associated with ore deposits and hydrocarbon accumulation,
   while forming efficient reservoirs for carbon sequestration. However,
   the current state of knowledge about the availability and reaction rate
   of Mg in dolomitizing fluids fails to explain the large volumes of
   hydrothermal dolomites geobodies observed in extended margins or in
   fold-and-thrust belts. To better understand this widespread phenomenon,
   it is essential to recognize the governing and limiting transport mode
   of the dolomitizing fluid. This contribution investigates the chemical
   and physical patterns developed between the original calcite and the
   newly formed dolomite. An extensive analytical study of well-preserved
   dolomitization interfaces observed at outcrop scale in
   Callovian-Oxfordian limestones in the Layens anticline (north-western
   Pyrenees, France) is presented. Through the use of scanning electron
   microscopy, electron backscattered diffraction, X-ray microtomography,
   laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (and
   mapping), the replacement related variations in elementary content, rock
   density, crystallographic properties and phase volumes and distribution
   were constrained. The results indicate a sequence of replacement,
   beginning with a fluid which starts to infiltrate the host rock by
   advection in the grain boundary network causing at the same time the
   replacement of calcite by diffusion-limited dissolution and associated
   dolomite precipitation. The progressive replacement of calcite grains by
   dolomite is led by dissolution inside the grain enhanced by replacement
   related porosity creation, leading to a progressive decrease of local
   calcite grain size isolated as islands until the replacement is
   complete. The replacement of calcite by dolomite led to a mass loss
   without volume change, through generation of ca 11 vol.\% porosity.
   Based on analytical observations of a natural sample, a conceptual model
   that accounts for the transport mode governing the different steps of
   hydrothermal dolomitization at crystal-scale is proposed.}},

Title = {{Development of a Novel Multiplex Bead-based Assay for Measuring
   Autoantibodies on Flow Cytometric Platform}},
Journal = {{IMMUNOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS}},
Abstract = {{Background: Autoantibodies (AAbs) are important biomarkers for the
   diagnosis of Autoimmune Diseases (ADs). The detection of AAbs performed
   by current methods (indirect immunofluorescence test (IIFT)/Immunoblot
   (dot/line)/enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ELISA) which have
   limitations in terms of performing multiple assays to arrive at
   laboratory diagnosis. We validated a novel multiplex bead-based assay
   (NMBA) that could quantify five common antibodies, simultaneously, on a
   flow-cytometry platform.
   Methods: A total of five recombinant antigens (SS-A Ro60, CENP B, RNP
   70, Scl 70 and Histones) were covalently coupled onto beads and tested
   using known positive sera (positive for AAbs) and analyzed using flow
   cytometer.
   Results: The sensitivity, specificity, Positive Predictive Value (PPV)
   and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) were obtained for each antigen,
   analyzed by both assays (NMBA and IIFT). It showed comparable or higher
   values for the NMBA. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (Rho)
   were >= 0.97, (P < .05), indicating that multiplexing of the five
   autoantigens did not alter the results obtained when antigens were
   tested individually. The mean intra-assay precision measured by
   coefficient of variation (CV) was7.56 +/- 1.6\% and the mean inter-assay
   CV was 10.03 +/- 1.34\%. The time taken from sample receipt to reporting
   of results was 90 minutes in NMBA as compared to 150 minutes of IIFT
   Conclusion: The NMBA could quantitatively measure antibodies against
   five autoantigens, simultaneously in patient's sera. The assay is
   faster, objective, reproducible, requires low sample volume, and stable.
   Moreover, the flow cytometer in diagnostic laboratory settings for
   hematological and transplant immunology tests, can also be used for
   testing AAbs.}},

Abstract = {{Histone lysine demethylase 6a (Kdm6a) mediates the removal of repressive
   trimethylation from histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) to activate target
   gene expression. Obesity is associated with metabolic inflammation, and
   adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) are key players orchestrating
   metabolic inflammation. However, it is still unclear whether the Kdm6a
   pathway in ATMs regulates energy homeostasis. Here, we identified Kdm6a
   as a critical epigenetic switch that modulates macrophage polarisation
   and further disrupts energy balance. Myeloid-specific Kdm6a knockout in
   Kdm6a(F/Y);Lyz2-Cre mice significantly reversed the high-fat diet
   (HFD)-induced M1-M2 imbalance in white adipose tissue (WAT) and blocked
   HFD-induced obesity. The brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity, WAT
   browning and energy expenditure were significantly increased in
   Kdm6a(F/Y);Lyz2-Cre mice. Furthermore, Kdm6a regulated the Ire1 alpha
   expression in a demethylase activity-dependent manner and augmented the
   M2 polarisation of macrophages. Macrophage with higher Kdm6a
   significantly promotes adipogenesis in white adipocyte and inhibits
   thermogenesis in beige adipocytes. These results suggest that the Kdm6a
   in macrophages drives obesity and metabolic syndrome by impairing BAT
   activity and WAT differentiation.}},

Title = {{XENON1T anomaly and its implication for decaying warm dark matter}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS LETTERS B}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{811}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{An excess in the electronic recoil data was observed in the XENON1T
   detector. One of plausible explanations for the excess is absorption of
   a vector bosonic particle with the mass of 2 - 3 keV. For this, the
   kinetic mixing kappa similar to 10(-15) of the dark photon with the
   photon is required if the dark photon explains the current DM abundance.
   We recently proposed a model where the main component DM today is a
   decaying warm dark matter (WDM) with the life time comparable to the age
   of the current universe. The WDM decays to a massless fermion and a
   massive dark photon. This model was originally designed for addressing
   both the small scale problems which ACDM suffers from and the H-0
   tension. In this letter, we show that the massive dark photon produced
   by the WDM decay can be identified with the vector boson inducing the
   anomalous excess in the XENON1T experiment. Depending on a lifetime of
   the parent decaying WDM, the dark photon could be either the main
   component or the sub-component of DM population today. (C) 2020 The

Title = {{Fluid mechanics of feeding determine the trophic niche of the

Journal = {{LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{66}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Phenotypic features define feeding selectivity in planktonic predators
   and therefore determine energy flow through food webs. In
   current-feeding cnidarian hydromedusae, swimming and predation are
   coupled such that swimming also brings prey into contact with feeding
   structures. Fluid mechanical disturbances may initiate escape responses
   by flow-sensing prey. Previous studies have not considered how fluid
   signals define the trophic niche of current-feeding gelatinous
   predators. We used the hydromedusa Clytia gregaria to determine (1) how
   passive (sinking) and active (swimming) feeding behavior affects
   pre-encounter responses of prey to the medusae-induced fluid motion, and
   (2) how prey responses affect the medusae's ingestion efficiencies.
   Videography of the predation process showed that passive prey such as
   invertebrate larvae were ingested during both feeding behaviors, whereas
   flow-sensing prey such as copepods escaped the predator's active feeding
   behavior, but were unable to detect the predator's passive sinking
   behavior and were ingested (KW X-2 = 19.8246, df = 4, p < 0.001). Flow
   visualizations using particle image velocimetry (PIV) showed fluid
   deformation values during passive feeding below threshold values that
   trigger escape responses of copepods. To address whether fluid signals
   mediate prey capture, we compared fluid signals produced by three
   hydromedusae with different diets. Aequorea victoria and Mitrocoma
   cellularia produced higher deformation than C. gregaria (two-way ANOVA,
   F-2,F-52 = 5.532, p = 0.007), which explains their previously documented
   negative selection for flow-sensing prey like copepods. Through the
   analysis of hydromedusan feeding behaviors and pre-encounter prey
   escapes, we provide evidence that fluid signatures shape the trophic
   niches of gelatinous predators.}},

Journal = {{WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Most of the traditional 2D image hashing schemes do not take into
   account the change of viewpoint when constructing the final hash vector.
   This result in the classification accuracy rate is unsatisfactory when
   applied for depth-image-based rendering (DBIR) 3D image identification.
   In this work, pixel grouping based on histogram shape and nonnegative
   matrix factorization (NMF) are applied to design DIBR 3D image hashing
   with better robustness resisting to geometric distortions and higher
   classification accuracy rate for virtual image identification.
   Experiments show that the proposed hashing is robust against common
   signal and geometric distortion attacks, such as additive noise,
   blurring, JPEG compression, scaling, and rotation. Compared with the
   state-of-art schemes of traditional 2D image hashing, the proposed
   hashing achieves better performances under above attacks, especially for

Title = {{Sustainable allocation of water resources in water-scarcity conditions
   using robust fuzzy stochastic programming}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{276}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Economic, social, and demographic development has globally led to an
   increased demand for water, consequently forcing some countries to face
   the shortage of water resources. In Iran, the problem of water scarcity
   is such a serious challenge that the sustainable allocation of water
   resources is sought after so as to help deal with this crisis. To this
   aim, the present paper proposes a new Robust Fuzzy Stochastic
   Programming model for the allocation of water resources. For the first
   time in the literature of stochastic water allocation problem, we
   applied the sustainability index to the optimization model and
   considered different levels of groundwater in an allocation system.
   Another feature of this model is its capability in considering a hybrid
   uncertainty in the parameters of the model, i.e. fuzzy stochastic
   scenarios, in a robust fuzzy stochastic programming model. Our proposed
   model considers three objective functions, namely maximizing the profits
   of different consumption sectors, minimizing the loss of different
   sectors caused by water shortage in different scenarios, and minimizing
   the allocation of salt water from ground water. The model has been
   applied in Mashhad city, northeastern Iran, which has long had water
   scarcity as an issue. We studied the allocation of water from surface,
   ground, and recycled wastewater resources to the three sectors of
   agricultural, municipal, and industrial; the results indicated that
   water allocation patterns and water shortages were affected by different
   scenarios. In fact, the municipal and agricultural sectors did not face
   water shortage in all scenarios, whereas the industrial sector
   encountered water scarcity in a drought year. Moreover, the assessment
   of optimality and feasibility robustness of the model indicated that the
   proposed model is robust. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{76}},

Abstract = {{In the midst of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, new unexpected and
   extraordinary scenes and sounds of aesthetical biblical and apocalyptic
   proportions are witnessed. Community and religious gatherings in public
   spaces are prohibited. Modern, conventional and traditional human
   achievements have become futile. One can describe the COVID-19 pandemic,
   and this new search for meaning as a juxtaposed tension of metaphorical
   apocalyptic vistas and metaphorical biblical vistas. The Bible holds the
   same juxtaposed tension which may help humanity to rediscover the
   semantics of biblical truth and hope - but it also espouses a
   metaphorical liberational vista of transcendence. Coronavirus could be a
   metaphor for something with extraordinary new possibilities. The
   biblical metaphors are being amplified in different metaphorical vistas
   to make it more discerning or accessible to the world population today.
   As a metaphorical liberation vista, it may offer new hope for a new kind
   of living, a new kind of humanity, a new kind of knowing and believing
   and a new kind of world order.
   Contribution: This article offers a Practical Theological contribution
   to the significance of the Bible within the COVID-19 pandemic context.
   Human suffering and divine metaphorical vistas encapsulate prospects for
   truth, hope and new meaning for the liberation of humanity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents measurement results of the complex dielectric
   permittivity depending on the humidity for a range of materials used in
   buildings. It covers a whole range from light to heavy materials with
   different hygroscopic properties and with a special focus on green
   building materials. Two specific adjustable stripline test devices of
   different lengths have been designed and used to perform the extractions
   of the permittivity from S-parameters measurements using the two
   transmission lines method. The study covers a frequency band extending
   from 500 MHz to 2.5 GHz and is carried out on dry, ambient and wet
   conditioned samples. The main trends are physically discussed, and
   phenomenological explanations based on the impedance matching and the
   water absorption among others are proposed for the observed behaviors.
   The use of the obtained data is illustrated through the extraction of
   the electromagnetic behavior of a realistic wall. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Selecting a large and diverse sample of 5-6-year-old preschool children
   (179 boys and 174 girls; M-age = 70.03 months, SDage = 3.43), we aimed
   to extend previous findings on variability in children's home math
   environment (i.e., home math activities, parental expectations, and
   attitudes) and its association with children's mathematical skills. We
   operationalized mathematics in a broader way than in previous studies,
   by considering not only children's numerical skills but also their
   patterning skills as integral components of early mathematical
   development. We investigated the effects of children's gender and
   socioeconomic status (SES) on their home math environment, examined the
   associations between children's home math environment and their
   mathematical skills, and verified whether these associations were
   moderated by children's gender and/or SES. Parents of 353 children
   completed a home math environment questionnaire and all children
   completed measures of their numerical (e.g., object counting) and
   patterning skills (e.g., extending repeating patterns). Results
   indicated no effect of children's gender on their home math environment.
   There was no effect of SES on the performed home math activities, but
   small SES differences existed in parents' math-related expectations and
   their attitudes. We found no evidence for associations between
   children's home math environment and their mathematical skills.
   Furthermore, there were no moderating effects of gender or SES on these
   associations. One explanation for these findings might relate to the
   characteristics of the general preschool system in the country of the
   present study (Belgium). Future studies should consider the effect of
   the preschool learning environment because it might explain differences
   between studies and countries with regard to the home math environment
   and its association with mathematical skills.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, an efficient green light-emitting CuInS2/ZnS core/shell
   quantum dots were synthesized using a low temperature (130 degrees C)
   hot injection methods combined with multi-layers ZnS coating strategy.
   S-OAm (S powder dissolved in oleylamine) was used as sulfur source
   instead of conventional dodecanethiol, which supplied high concentration
   of H2S at low temperature and led to explosive nucleation of CuInS2 and
   hence high concentration small size of CIS cores. Meanwhile, this method
   could supply enough sulfur sources for the ZnS coating process,
   resulting in high quality ZnCuInS2 alloyed interface and ZnS surface
   coating layers, which led to excellent lattice match between the CuInS2
   core and ZnS shells, and better surface passivation. As the consequence,
   a maximum photoluminescence quantum yields of similar to 85\% at peak
   wavelength of similar to 530 nm has been achieved. Based on this, the
   light emitting diodes with a maximum luminance of 4450 cd m(-2),
   luminous efficiency of 3.52 cd A(-1) and an external quantum efficiency
   of 1.44\% has been obtained, which is the best result so far for the
   green emission light emitting diodes based on the CuInS2 quantum dots.

Abstract = {{Accurate modelling of peat water contents (theta) is critical for
   wetland studies. We modified the Campbell and Van Genuchten soil water
   retention curves (SWRCs) by replacing their empirical parameters with
   measurable properties. Combining the water table depth (d (WT)) into
   SWRCs, we derived formulae for calculating volumetric theta from d (WT),
   coded in a simple model to test our hypotheses that d (WT) is a reliable
   predictor of theta for peat of low and high water holding capacity at
   near-saturation. We compared our simulations with time-domain
   reflectometry theta measurements at Mer Bleue bog (Ontario, Canada) and
   the Western Peatland fen (Alberta, Canada). Constraining Campbell SWRC
   at extreme drying and waterlogging rather than wilting point and field
   capacity produced superior results. The Van Genuchten SWRC was
   approximated by hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic segments. When
   simplified, its performance reconciles with that of the modified
   Campbell SWRC. Overall, our formulae performed well with generalized
   peat parameters.}},

Title = {{Alcohol-related mortality and all-cause mortality following bereavement
   in two successive generations}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Background and aim
   Bereavement affects the health of the bereaved both emotionally and
   physically. Bereavement resulting from alcohol-related death of the
   previous generation (parents-first generation) may increase the risk of
   alcohol abuse and consequently alcohol-related mortality as well as
   all-cause mortality in the next generation (offspring-second
   generation). Furthermore, these associations can be bi-directional.
   However, there is no conclusive evidence of these effects, and studies
   exploring these intergenerational effects are rare. This study
   investigates these associations.
   Methods
   A longitudinal data were constructed by linking participants from the
   Adolescent Health and Lifestyle Surveys (AHLS) from 1979 to 1997 with
   census and registry-based data from Statistics Finland containing the
   socioeconomic status of the survey participants and their parents (N =
   78610) to investigate these associations. Multivariate Cox proportional
   hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios with 95\% confidence
   intervals to determine the effect of bereavement with alcohol-related
   mortality and all-cause mortality.
   Results
   The findings suggest that bereavement following the death of an
   offspring increases the risk of both alcohol-related and all-cause
   mortality among both parents. The magnitude of the risk of mortality
   following the death of an offspring is higher for mothers than for
   fathers. There were no clear associations of a parent's death with an
   offspring's alcohol-related or all-cause mortality. However, generally,
   a father's death seems to be protective of the risk of mortality among
   the offspring while a mother's alcohol-related death slightly increased
   the risk of alcohol-related mortality among their offspring.
   Conclusions
   These findings emphasise the role of bereavement, particularly resulting
   from the death of an offspring, on alcohol-related and all-cause
   mortality and therefore inequalities in mortality. Furthermore, the
   findings highlighting the need for alcohol abuse intervention and
   emotional support for bereaved persons following the death of an
   offspring.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we evaluated the effects of autologous serum collected
   after two types of exercise on the in vitro inflammatory profile and T
   cell phenotype of resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in
   obese men. Serum samples and PBMCs were obtained from eight obese men
   who performed two exercise bouts-high intensity interval exercise (HIIE)
   and exhaustive exercise session to voluntary fatigue-in a randomized
   cross-over trial. Pre-exercise PBMCs were incubated with 50\% autologous
   serum (collected before and after each exercise bout) for 4 h. In vitro
   experiments revealed that post-HIIE serum reduced the histone H4
   acetylation status and NF-kappa B content of PBMCs and suppressed the
   production of both TNF-alpha and IL-6 by PBMCs, while increasing IL-10
   production. Post-exhaustive exercise serum induced histone H4
   hyperacetylation and mitochondrial depolarization in lymphocytes and
   increased TNF-alpha production. In vitro post-HIIE serum incubation
   resulted in an increase in the frequencies of CD4+CTLA-4+and CD4+CD25+ T
   cells expressing CD39 and CD73. Post-exhaustive exercise serum decreased
   the frequency of CD4+CD25+CD73+ T cells but increased CD4+CD25-CD39+T
   cell frequency. Both post-exercise serums increased the proportions of
   CD4+PD-1+and CD8+PD-1+ T cells. Blood serum factors released during
   exercise altered the immune response and T cell phenotype. The type of
   exercise impacted the immunomodulatory activity of the post-exercise
   serum on PBMCs.}},

Abstract = {{This study used Hypnofertility-based interventions to determine whether

   61 Turkish women with unexplained infertility (intervention group: 30,
   control group: 31). Hypnofertility-based nursing care included
   affirmations, visualization, imagination, and relaxation from the first
   day of treatment until the day of the pregnancy test. The Fertility
   Preparedness Scale, a saliva sample for cortisol level, and the
   pregnancy test results were used for data collection.
   Hypnofertility-based nursing care decreased the cortisol levels of women
   in the intervention group compared to that in the control group (p =
   0.00). Though fertility preparedness was higher in the intervention
   group, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.13).
   Although interventions relieved the women during the treatment process,
   there was no anticipated effect on pregnancy outcomes (p = 0.75).

Abstract = {{Near-field measurements are commonly performed in anechoic chambers
   which limits the flexibility of the measurements and requires high

   investigate a simple near-field measurement setup which does not use any

   environment. Instead, the probe antenna is moved by an operator person
   while the probe position is measured by a laser tracker. This implies
   that the measurement results will have a higher error level in
   comparison with antenna chamber measurements. However, excellent error
   levels are not always necessary, especially when it comes to on-site
   testing of the principle functionality of antennas. Measurement results
   are shown to illustrate the performance of the system.}},

Title = {{Adaptive Memory: Independent Effects of Survival Processing and Reward
   Motivation on Memory}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Humans preferentially remember information processed for their survival
   relevance, a memorial benefit known as the survival processing effect.
   Memory is also biased towards information associated with the prospect
   of reward. Given the adaptiveness of these effects, they may depend on
   similar mechanisms. We tested whether motivation drives both effects,
   with reward incentives that are known to boost extrinsic motivation and
   survival processing perhaps stimulating intrinsic motivation.
   Accordingly, we manipulated survival processing and reward incentive
   independently during an incidental-encoding task in which participants
   chose between pairs of words concerning their relevance for a scenario,
   and examined the effects on encoding event-related potentials (ERP)
   activity and later performance on a surprise recall test. We
   hypothesized that if survival processing fosters intrinsic motivation,
   it should reduce the beneficial effects of extrinsic motivation (reward
   incentive). In contrast to this prediction, we found that reward
   incentive and survival processing independently improved memory and that
   the P300, a measure of lower-level cognitive resource allocation, was
   increased by reward incentive independent of survival processing.
   Further, survival processing and reward incentive independently
   increased the frontal slow wave (FSW), a measure of higher-level
   elaboration. These findings suggest that while survival processing and
   reward incentive may both increase encoding elaboration, the
   memory-enhancing effect of survival processing does not depend on
   increased intrinsic motivation. Additionally, we replicated a recent
   finding whereby the survival processing effect generalizes to a
   choice-based encoding task and further showed that the beneficial effect
   of choice on memory likely does not interact with either survival
   processing or reward.}},

Abstract = {{Cu2O, a photoactive p-type semiconductor based on earth-abundant

   PEC CO2RR promoter via amine-CO2 adduct formation. Electrochemistry
   experiments and X-ray diffraction showed that photostability is
   significantly enhanced with AF-PSi overlayer. Electrolyses experiments
   under visible light irradiation indicated selective production of
   formate with faradaic efficiency of 61 \% at low overpotential. Detailed
   in situ FTIR studies revealed that amine groups bind to CO2 to form
   carbamate species and that this process is favoured by cathodic

Abstract = {{Intravitreal delivery of antibody-based therapeutics has revolutionized
   the treatment of intraocular vascular diseases involving the retina and
   choroid. Unfortunately, limited durability requires frequent retreatment
   placing an enormous burden on patients. We sought to solve this problem
   with a novel approach that uses an anchoring molecule characterized by
   two key molecular properties: (1) non-covalent binding to an
   antibodybased therapeutic, and (2) retention in the vitreous cavity. As
   an initial proof-of-principle, we chose an anchoring molecule composed
   of agarose microbeads functionalized with an Fc-binding domain.
   Bevacizumab was chosen as the antibody-based therapeutic. In vitro
   experiments demonstrated that bevacizumab was maximally bound to this
   anchoring molecule within 1 h, and was competitively released upon
   exposure to either polyclonal human (p < 0.0001) or rat (p = 0.0017)
   immunoglobulins. In silico modeling predicted prolonged intravitreal
   retention of an antibody-based therapeutic in the presence of this
   anchoring molecule, which was confirmed by in vivo experiments with this
   initial anchoring molecule in rats. This anchoring molecule increased
   the intraocular half-life of bevacizumab from 5.8 days to over 18 days
   and maintained therapeutic concentrations for over 80 days. Despite
   showing no evidence of direct cellular toxicity, this anchoring molecule
   collected in the anterior vitreous, partially obscuring retinal
   visualization and eliciting a mild chronic microglial/macrophage
   inflammatory response. These studies provide a plausible approach to the
   development of novel non-covalent methods of binding, retention, and
   release of antibody-based therapeutics in the vitreous.}},

Title = {{Road performance of liquid nitrile-butadiene rubber modified unsaturated
   polyester resin concrete}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{263}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Unsaturated polyester resin concrete (UPC) is currently gaining
   attention in many fields due to its functional compressive capacity and
   corrosion resistance. However, the toughness of UPC is poor due to the
   weak resistance to the deformation of the cured unsaturated polyester
   resin (UP). In this paper, the UP was modified with liquid
   nitrile-butadiene rubber (LNBR) and further used to make concrete. At
   the same time, two different initiators were used to cure the UPC and
   LNBR modified UPC. To study the mechanism and road performance of LNBR
   modified UPC performance, optical microscopy test, Marshall test, water
   immersion Marshall test, rutting test, freeze-thaw split test, and
   infrared spectroscopy experiments were carried out. Test results showed
   that LNBR could effectively improve the low-temperature toughness of
   UPC. Although LNBR slightly reduced the Marshall stability and rutting
   resistance of UPC, it hardly changed the water stability of the UPC.
   LNBR could crosslink with UP to form a joint body, and the amount of
   initiator may have a more significant impact on the performance of the
   UPC and LNBR modified UPC. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The consultative assemblies were far from an institutionalized assembly
   that implemented and followed up reforms. They gained importance with a
   decrease in the influence of the Imperial Council. Therefore, to monitor
   the reforms in the military field and to serve the Prime Ministry as
   advisory committees, the Supreme Council of the Military and the Supreme
   Council of the Government were established. In addition to these two
   assemblies, the Supreme Council of Judicial Ordinance, assembled in the
   palace and therefore chaired by Mahmud II, was also established. In this
   assembly, internal, external, financial, and military works were
   renegotiated, issues were arranged to be changed or corrected, and then
   presented to the sultan. The Supreme Council of Judicial Ordinance
   played a significant role in the legislative and in the judiciary since
   the discontinuation of the Imperial Council and the failure of the
   consultative assemblies to fill its void although it was established for
   the purpose of monitoring and carrying out the Tanzimat reforms.
   However, it is obvious that it had a different structure from that of
   the Imperial Council, which was its predecessor. It was not a
   representative structure; rather, it was a transitional institution
   between the Council (Divan) and Western-style parliament in terms of its
   structure and the tasks it performed.}},

Abstract = {{Civic thinking and civic attitude require values and norms for social
   togetherness and social engagement. Service learning and
   active-citizenship learning are high-impact pedagogies, well-documented
   as supporting civic-mindedness and a culture of democracy sustainably.
   Though our study is part of a broader research project, this brief
   research report already documents the impact of the two pedagogies on
   civic-mindedness and students' democratic awareness. Through a
   mixed-method design we implemented a quantitative survey (7 level Likert
   Scale) of undergraduate student learning outcomes of service learning
   with 55 students from the University of Hawai'i at Manoa and 41 students
   practicing active-citizenship learning at Salzburg University of Teacher
   Education. We found that the two pedagogies significantly support
   students' democratic awareness and civic attitudes. In addition to the
   survey, a qualitative analysis is in progress based on 23 focus group
   discussions, conducted to detail how the students experience themselves
   when they take on social responsibility, e.g., when they actively
   participate in improving their society. Our mixed, but narrowly focused,
   approach combined with well-established measuring tools and scales is a
   first study of how to assess Attitudes, one of the four fundamental
   principles of the Council of Europe's Competency Model for a Democratic
   Culture.}},

Abstract = {{Macrophage elastase {[}matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-12] is the most

   Here, we report the design, synthesis, and evaluation of three novel
   hydroxamate-based selective MMP-12 inhibitors (CGA, CGA-1, and AGA) and
   the methodology to obtain MMP-12 selectivity from hydroxamate-based
   panMMP inhibitors. Also, we report two Tc-99m-radiotracers, Tc-99m-AGA-1
   and Tc-99m-AGA-2, derived from AGA. Tc-99m-AGA-2 displayed faster blood
   clearance in mice and better radiochemical stability compared to
   Tc-99m-AGA-1. Based on this, Tc-99m-AGA-2 was chosen as the lead tracer
   and tested in murine AAA. Tc-99m-AGA-2 uptake detected by
   autoradiography was significantly higher in AAA compared to normal
   aortic regions. Specific binding of the tracer to MMP-12 was
   demonstrated through ex vivo competition. Accordingly, this study
   introduces a novel family of selective MMP-12 inhibitors and tracers,
   paving the way for further development of these agents as therapeutic
   and imaging agents.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The aim of the study was to propose an efficient chairside
   clinical strategy for the identification of undiagnosed hyperglycaemia
   in periodontal clinics.
   Material and methods: Alpha chairside system was used for assessment of
   glycated hemoglobin 1c (HbA1c) and active Matrix Metalloproteinase-8
   levels (aMMP-8) were analyzed by immunotest in patients (n = 150) who
   fulfilled the criteria for screening of the Centers for Disease Control
   and Prevention. Full-mouth periodontal parameters were assessed and
   various data such as Body Mass Index (BMI), smoking and education were
   recorded.
   Results: Thirty-one patients out of 150 tested were found with unknown
   hyperglycaemia (20.7\%). Regarding sex, education, parent with diabetes,
   normal BMI, smoking, age >= 45 years and prior testing for diabetes, no
   differences were observed between subjects displaying HbA1c < 5.7 and >=
   5.7\% (Pearson's Chi-square test, p > .05). Subgroups differed regarding
   BMI (kg/m(2)), tooth count, percentages of 4 and 5 mm pockets
   (Mann-Whitney and z-test, p < .05). The diagnostic performance for HbA1c
   >= 5.7 was tested by Receiving Operator Characteristic curves and Areas
   Under the Curve (AUC) for the following: age >= 45 years and BMI (AUC
   0.651, p = .010), the above and aMMP-8 (AUC 0.660, p = .006), age >= 45
   years, BMI and Stage of Periodontitis (AUC 0.711, p < .001) and age >=
   45 years, BMI, aMMP-8 and stage of periodontitis (AUC 0.713, p < .001).
   Conclusions: Findings of the study suggest that the combination of stage
   of periodontitis, increasing age, BMI and aMMP-8, without chairside
   HbA1c assessment appears to be a viable screening strategy for referring
   dental patients for testing for prediabetes/diabetes.}},

Title = {{Extreme wall shear stress events in turbulent pipe flows: spatial
   characteristics of coherent motions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{904}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{This work presents a detailed analysis of the flow structures relevant
   to extreme wall shear stress events for turbulent pipe flow direct
   numerical simulation data at a friction Reynolds number . The results
   reveal that extreme positive wall-friction events are located below an
   intense sweep (Q4) event originated from a strong quasi-streamwise
   vortex at the buffer region. This vortex transports high streamwise
   momentum from the overlap and the outer layers towards the wall, giving
   rise to a high-speed streak within the inner region. This vortical
   structure also relates to regions with extreme wall-normal velocity.
   Consequently, the conditional fields of turbulence production and
   viscous dissipation exhibit peaks whose magnitudes are approximately 25
   times higher than the ensemble mean quantities in the vicinity of the
   extreme positive events. An analysis of the turbulent inertia force
   reveals that the energetic quasi-streamwise vortex acts as an essential
   source of momentum at the near-wall region. Similarly, extremely rare
   backflow events are studied. An examination of the wall-normal vorticity
   and velocity vector fields shows an identifiable oblique vortical
   structure along with two other large-scale roll modes. These
   counter-rotating motions contribute to the formation of backflow events
   by transporting streamwise momentum from the inner to the outer region,
   creating a large-scale meandering low-speed streak. It is found that
   extreme events are clustered below large-scale structures of positive
   streamwise momentum that interact with near-wall low-speed streaks,
   related to regions densely populated with vortical structures. Finally,
   a three-dimensional model is proposed to conceptualise the flow dynamics
   associated with extreme events.}},

Title = {{An interacting fermion-antifermion pair in the spacetime background
   generated by static cosmic string}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS LETTERS B}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{811}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{We consider a general relativistic fermion antifermion pair that they
   interact via an attractive Coulomb type interparticle interaction
   potential in the 2 + 1 dimensional spacetime background spanned by
   cosmic string. By performing an exact solution of the corresponding
   fully-covariant two body Dirac Coulomb type equation we obtain an energy
   spectrum that depends on angular deficit parameter of the static cosmic
   string spacetime background for such a composite system. We arrive that
   the influence of cosmic string spacetime topology on the binding energy
   of Positronium-like atoms can be seen in all order of the coupling
   strength constant, even in the well-known non-relativistic binding
   energy term (proportional to alpha(2)(c)). We obtain that the angular
   deficit of the static cosmic string spacetime background causes a
   screening effect. For a predicted value of angular deficit parameter,
   alpha similar to 1 - 10(-6), we apply the obtained result to an
   ortho-positronium, which is an unstable atom formed by an electron and
   its antimatter counterpart a positron, and then we determine the shift
   in the ground state binding energy level as 27, 2 mu eV. We also arrive
   that, in principle, the shift in ground state binding energy of
   ortho-positronium can be measured even for alpha similar to 1 - 10(-11)
   value with current techniques in use today. Moreover, this also gives us
   an opportunity to determine the altered total annihilation energy
   transmitted by the annihilation photons. The yields also impose that the
   total lifetime of an ortho-positronium can be changed by the topological
   feature of static cosmic string spacetime background. In principle, we
   show that an ortho-positronium system has a potential to prove the
   existence of such a spacetime background. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Abstract = {{Introduction: Pomegranate is known as a functional food which has
   multiple health-promoting activities. It has been assessed for patients
   with metabolic syndrome. Specifically, an antidiabetic activity of its
   juice and plausible mechanisms for its action have been shown in
   multitudinous studies. The aim of this study was assessing the effects
   of complementary treatment with pomegranate seed powder (PSP) oral
   supplementation on patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
   Methods: Sixty patients were treated for 8 weeks by 5 g PSP or placebo,
   twice daily. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)),
   total cholesterol, and triglyceride (TG) were recorded as the outcome
   measures at the beginning and after the intervention. The findings were
   analyzed using the independent t test and Mann-Whitney U test. Results:
   After 8 weeks, the mean differences of FBG, HbA(1c), cholesterol, and TG
   were significantly decreased in the PSP group when compared with the
   placebo group (p value <0.05). In addition, post-intervention values of
   FBG and HbA(1c) were significantly lower in patients treated with PSP
   compared to the placebo group (p values = 0.02 and 0.01, respectively).
   However, the latter comparison regarding cholesterol and TG showed no
   significant differences (p values = 0.51 and 0.26, respectively).
   Conclusion: It seems that complementary treatment with PSP may have
   beneficial effects on FBG and HbA(1c) of patients with T2DM. However,
   its effect on TG and cholesterol was equivocal.}},

Abstract = {{Background The biceps-labrum complex is prone to acute lesions and
   degenerative changes due to its anatomical structure and the high load
   it has to endure. Pathological changes of these structures are common
   pain generators and can significantly impair shoulder function.
   Anatomically, the biceps-labrum complex can be divided into three zones:
   inside, junction and bicipital tunnel. Diagnostic procedure Despite the
   focused physical examination and advancements in imaging techniques, the
   exact localization of pathologies remains challenging. Arthroscopy can
   be used to accurately diagnose inside and junctional pathologies but
   extra-articular changes in the region of the bicipital tunnel can only
   be partially visualized. Treatment In cases of unsuccessful conservative
   treatment and correct indications, a high level of patient satisfaction
   can be surgically achieved. In young patients an anatomical
   reconstruction of inside lesions or tenodesis of the long head of the
   biceps tendon is performed; however, even tenotomy is a valuable option
   and can achieve equally satisfactory results. Unaddressed pathological
   changes of the bicipital tunnel can lead to persistence of pain. In
   clinical procedures performing tenodesis, both the different techniques
   and the implants used have been found to show similar results. This
   article describes the anatomical principles, pathological changes, the
   focused clinical instrumental diagnostics and discusses the different
   treatment philosophies as well as the outcome according to the recent
   literature.}},

Abstract = {{Cholinesterase (ChE) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors have been
   attracted as candidate treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Fifteen
   khellactone-type coumarins from the roots of Peucedanum japonicum
   Thunberg were tested for acetylcholinesterase (AChE),
   butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and MAO inhibitory activities. Compound 3
   `-angeloyl-4 `-(2-methylbutyryl)khellactone (PJ13) most potently
   inhibited AChE (IC50=9.28 mu M), followed by 3 `-isovaleryl-4
   `-(2-methylbutyroyl)khellactone (PJ15) (IC50=10.0 mu M). Compound
   senecioyl-4 `-angeloyl-khellactone (PJ5) most potently inhibited BChE
   (IC50=7.22 mu M) and had the highest selectivity index (>5.54), followed
   by 3 `-senecioyl-4 `-(2-methylbutyryl)khellactone (PJ10) and 3 `,4
   `-disenecioylkhellactone (PJ4) (IC50=10.2 and 10.7 mu M, respectively).
   Compounds PJ13, PJ15, and PJ5 showed reversible and mixed-types of
   inhibition with K-i values of 5.98, 10.4 (for AChE), and 4.16 mu M (for
   BChE), respectively. However, all 15 compounds weakly inhibited MAO-A
   and MAO-B. Molecular docking simulation revealed that PJ13 had a higher
   binding affinity (-9.3 kcal/mol) with AChE than PJ15 (-7.8 kcal/mol) or
   PJ5 (- 5.4 kcal/mol), due to the formation of a hydrogen bond with
   Tyr121 (distance: 2.52 angstrom). On the other hand, the binding
   affinity of PJ5 (-10.0 kcal/mol) with BChE was higher than for PJ13
   (-7.7 kcal/mol) or PJ15 (-8.1 kcal/mol), due to the formation of a
   hydrogen bond with Ser198 (distance: 2.05 angstrom). These results
   suggest that PJ13 and PJ5 are potential reversible selective inhibitors
   of AChE and BChE, respectively, for the treatment of AD.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL EDUCATION IN SCIENCE AND

Abstract = {{Diagnostic testing on entry to university provides an opportunity for
   students to ascertain individual strengths and weaknesses and allows
   course teams to gain insight into the competencies of the whole cohort.
   Coventry University has been using the same diagnostic test since 1991
   and a previous analysis showed students coming to Coventry University in
   2001 were performing considerably worse than their counterparts in 1991.
   Given the changes to A level Mathematics that have taken place since
   2001 and the recently implemented reforms to A level Mathematics in the
   UK, it is timely to review performance in the diagnostic test and to
   create a benchmark before students enter higher education with the new
   (linear) A levels. This paper therefore reports on the changing entry
   competencies of students at Coventry University from 2001 to 2017 and
   shows that there has been a general improvement in performance across
   all entry grades. However, students are still not performing at the same
   level as they were in 1991 and the gap between students with higher
   entry grades (A level A{*}-C) and lower entry grades (A level D-E) is
   getting wider.}},

Abstract = {{Ozonolysis of unsaturated organic species with water produces
   a-hydroxyalkylhydroperoxides (alpha-HHs), which are reactive
   intermediates that lead to the formation of H2O2 and multifunctionalized
   species in atmospheric condensed phases. Here, we report
   temperaturedependent rate coefficients (k) for the aqueous-phase
   decomposition of alpha-terpineol alpha-HHs at 283-318 K and
   terpinen-4-ol alpha a-HHs at 313-328 K. The temporal profiles of
   alpha-HH signals, detected as chloride adducts by negative-ion
   electrospray mass spectrometry, showed single-exponential decay, and the
   derived first-order k for alpha-HH decomposition increased as
   temperature increased, e.g., k(288 K) = (4.7 +/- 0.2) X 10(-5), k(298 K)
   = (1.5 +/- 0.4) X 10(-4), k(308 K) = (3.4 +/- 0.9) X 10(-4), k(318 K)
   (1.0 +/- 0.2) X 10(-3) s(-1) for alpha-terpineol alpha-HHs at pH 6.1.
   Arrhenius plot analysis yielded activation energies of 17.9 +/- 0.7 (pH
   6.1) and 17.1 +/- 0.2 kcal mol(-1) (pH 6.2) for the decomposition of
   alpha-terpineol and terpinen-4-ol alpha-HHs, respectively. Activation
   energies of 18.6 +/- 0.2 and 19.2 +/- 0.5 kcal mol(-1) were also
   obtained for the decomposition of alpha-terpineol alpha-HHs in acidified
   water at pH 5.3 and 4.5, respectively. Theoretical kinetic and
   thermodynamic calculations confirmed that both water-catalyzed and
   proton-catalyzed mechanisms play important roles in the decomposition of
   these alpha-HHs. The relatively strong temperature dependence of k
   suggests that the lifetime of these alpha-HHs in aqueous phases (e.g.,
   aqueous aerosols, fog, cloud droplets, wet films) is controlled not only
   by the water content and pH but also by the temperature of these media.}},

Title = {{Thiamine-Mediated Cooperation Between Auxotrophic Rhodococcus ruber ZM07
   and Escherichia coli K12 Drives Efficient Tetrahydrofuran Degradation}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Tetrahydrofuran (THF) is a universal solvent widely used in the
   synthesis of chemicals and pharmaceuticals. As a refractory organic
   contaminant, it can only be degraded by a small group of microbes. In
   this study, a thiamine auxotrophic THF-degrading bacterium, Rhodococcus
   ruber ZM07, was isolated from an enrichment culture H-1. It was
   cocultured with Escherichia coli K12 (which cannot degrade THF but can
   produce thiamine) and/or Escherichia coli K12 Delta thiE (which can
   neither degrade THF nor produce thiamine) with or without exogenous
   thiamine. This study aims to understand the interaction mechanisms
   between ZM07 and K12. We found that K12 accounted for 30\% of the total
   when cocultured and transferred with ZM07 in thiamine-free systems; in
   addition, in the three-strain (ZM07, K12, and K12 Delta thiE) cocultured
   system without thiamine, K12 Delta thiE disappeared in the 8th transfer,
   while K12 could still stably exist (the relative abundance remained at
   approximately 30\%). The growth of K12 was significantly inhibited in
   the thiamine-rich system. Its proportion was almost below 4\% after the
   fourth transfer in both the two-strain (ZM07 and K12) and three-strain
   (ZM07, K12, and K12 Delta thiE) systems; K12 Delta thiE's percentage was
   higher than K12's in the three-strain (ZM07, K12, and K12 Delta thiE)
   cocultured system with exogenous thiamine, and both represented only a
   small proportion (less than 1\% by the fourth transfer). The results of
   the coculture of K12 and K12 Delta thiE in thiamine-free medium
   indicated that intraspecific competition between them may be one of the
   main reasons for the extinction of K12 Delta thiE in the three-strain
   (ZM07, K12, and K12 Delta thiE) system without exogenous thiamine.
   Furthermore, we found that ZM07 could cooperate with K12 through
   extracellular metabolites exchanges without physical contact. This study
   provides novel insight into how microbes cooperate and compete with one
   another during THF degradation.}},

Abstract = {{alpha-Methylene-gamma-lactones are present in similar to 3\% of known
   natural products, and compounds comprising this motif display a range of
   biological activities. However, this reactive lactone limits informed
   structure-activity relationships for these bioactive molecules. Herein,
   we describe chemically tuning the electrophilicity of the
   alpha-methylene-gamma-lactone by replacement with an
   alpha-methylene-gamma-lactam. Guaianolide analogues having
   alpha-methylene-gamma-lactams are synthesized using the allenic
   Pauson-Khand reaction. Substitution of the lactam nitrogen with
   electronically different groups affords diverse thiol reactivity.
   Cellular NF-kappa B inhibition assays for these lactams were benchmarked
   against parthenolide and a synthetic alpha-methylene-gamma-lactone
   showing a positive correlation between thiol reactivity and bioactivity.
   Cytotoxicity assays show good correlation at the outer limits of thiol
   reactivity but less so for compounds with intermediate reactivity. A La
   assay to detect reactive molecules by nuclear magnetic resonance and
   mass spectrometry peptide sequencing assays with the La antigen protein
   demonstrate that lactam analogues with muted nonspecific thiol
   reactivities constitute a better electrophile for rational chemical
   probe and therapeutic molecule design.}},

Abstract = {{Entire nations are fighting against the novel corona virus through
   economic stimulus and existential medical infrastructure, however
   continuous increase in positive COVID-19 cases, highlights an alarming
   trend. Therefore, it becomes utter necessary to forecast the number
   cases accurately so that we can be prepared for the worst outcome. In
   this paper, Auto regression integrated moving average (ARIMA) model is
   implemented to predict and analyze the trend of this pandemic. Further,
   two indices are formulated as recovery deceased ratio (RDR) and positive
   test ratio (PTR) in conjugation with trend in other countries and
   predicting peak for Indian scenario and peak in highly affected states.
   The proposed methodology based on ARIMA in combination with PTR and RDR
   is compared with classical ARIMA model. Through this study, upcoming
   cases for five states and one union territory (highly affected) are
   forecasted and later expanded the scope toward Indian landscape to
   further analyze the peak and recovery thereafter.}},

Abstract = {{Different compositions of graphene oxide (GO) and detonation nanodiamond
   (DND) nanoparticles with API CH-4 engine oil were tested on a
   reciprocating wear tester at high contact pressure. Significant
   reductions in friction and wear were observed. Wear surfaces were
   characterized by a 3D profiler, scanning electron microscopy and
   energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy to determine the surface
   topography, film build-up composition, mechanism of
   nanoadditive-assisted friction reduction and wear reduction
   characteristics. The wear tests indicated that the original engine liner
   segments containing surface texture with oil retention potential
   significantly lose their micropeaks and valleys during the test. Even
   though the surface texture got disturbed, the presence of nanoadditives
   in the lubricant led to a reduction in the coefficient of friction.
   Considerable reduction in the roughness level of the wear track
   associated with the use of a nanolubricant was also explored through the
   3D profiler analysis. The surface roughness of the wear track produced
   while using a nanolubricant with 0.5 mg/l of detonation nanodiamond
   nanoparticles was 66\% lower than the roughness of the wear track
   obtained with the base oil. The nanolubricant suspended with 1 mg/l
   detonation nanodiamond nanoparticles achieved a lower coefficient of
   friction earlier and a combination of detonation nanodiamond and GO at
   0.5 mg/l concentration achieved the lowest coefficient of friction and
   wear at the end of the test duration.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HAND AND MICROSURGERY}},
Abstract = {{Introduction Scapholunate interosseous ligament injury (SLIL) is the
   most common cause of wrist instability and a cause of morbidity in a
   proportion of patients with wrist injuries. Aim To evaluate the accuracy
   of plain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MR arthrogram (MRA) in the
   diagnosis of SLIL injury against the existing gold standard-wrist
   arthroscopy. Materials and Methods We retrospectively reviewed 108 cases
   by comparing MRI/MRA reports and their wrist arthroscopy operation
   notes. Results Overall MRI sensitivity to SLIL injuries was 38.5\%
   (91.0\% specificity). When broken down into plain MRI and MRA the
   results were: plain MRI sensitivity = 19.2\% (91.4\% specificity) and
   MRA sensitivity = 57.7\% (90.5\% specificity). Conclusion Neither MRI
   nor MRA scanning is sensitive enough compared with the gold standard.
   Positive predictive value remains too low (62.5 and 88.2\%,
   respectively) to consider bypassing diagnostic arthroscopy and treating
   surgically. The negative predictive value (60.4 and 63.6\%,
   respectively) is inadequate to confirm exclusion of injury from MRI
   results alone.}},

   electrodeposition through thermoresponsive hydrogel layer}},
Journal = {{ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Electrode surface was modified with a layer of a nanocomposite. The
   nanocomposite consisted of electrodeposited nanosized silver structures
   and thermosensitive hydrogel. The modification procedure consisted of
   two steps. In the first one, the thermosensitive hydrogel, based on
   poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPA), was electrodeposited. At
   appropriate temperatures (lower or higher than circa 32 degrees C) this
   hydrogel existed either in the swollen- or the shrunken state. Even in
   the shrunken state, the hydrogel deposited on the electrode surface
   still contained pinholes and microchannels. Due to this fact, small
   electroactive redox probes could diffuse to the electrode surface. In
   the second preparation step the silver nanoobjects were
   electrodeposited. It was done through the shrunken pNIPA layer. The
   hydrogel layer acted as a template and finally became one of the
   components of the composite. We found that the composite adhered
   satisfactorily to the GC and Pt electrode surfaces. The properties of
   the composite layers were examined with cyclic voltammetry and scanning
   electron microscopy. Finally, it was demonstrated that the GC electrodes
   modified in the proposed manner exhibited electrocatalytic activity. As
   an example the electroreduction of H2O2 was selected. It appeared that
   hydrogen peroxide could be successfully determined. The detection limit
   was found to be 48 mu M. The presented approach should enable
   electrodeposition of other potentially useful metals nanostructures. (C)

   mortars}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{In this experimental study, the impacts of replacing cement by Mica and
   Feldspar on rheological, mechanical and thermal durability of
   self-compacting mortars (SCMs) are investigated. The cement was
   partially replaced by Mica and Feldspar at the substitution rates of
   10\%, 20\% and 30\%. In general, 14 mix designs of SCMs were considered
   in two series with w/b ratios of 0.4 and 0.3. For assessment of
   rheological properties, mini-cone slump flow test and mini V-funnel
   tests were performed. The compressive strengths after 3, 7, 28 and 90
   days of curing, and the 28-day flexural strength were obtained. All
   mixes were subjected to water absorption and sorptivity tests. For
   investigating the thermal durability, residual compressive strength
   after high-temperature exposure at 600 degrees C were investigated.
   Also, the microstructure of specimens was assessed by using Scanning
   Electron Microscope (SEM) images. The results indicated that all the SCM
   mixes containing Mica and feldspar with different w/b ratios had
   acceptable rheological properties considering EFNARC criteria.
   Mechanical properties were slightly decreased by Mica and Feldspar
   replacement, and the mixes containing Feldspar showed higher mechanical
   properties in comparison with mixes containing Mica. Replacing the
   cement by Mica and Feldspar decreased the sorptivity coefficient of SCMs
   and remarkably improved the thermal durability. Mix designs contained
   20\% of Mica showed the maximum residual compressive strengths after
   high temperature exposure in both w/b ratios. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Urbanization does not affect green space bird species richness in a

Journal = {{URBAN ECOSYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{789-800}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Urbanization is one of the most intensive forms of landscape and habitat
   transformation, resulting in species loss, and taxonomic and functional
   homogenization of different communities. Whilst green infrastructure
   (the network of natural and semi-natural areas in cities) has been
   studied extensively in terms of specific features that promote
   biodiversity, there have been no studies that have assessed how species
   richness in different types of green space (GS) varies with increasing
   levels of urbanization in the surrounding matrix. We studied the effects
   of different types of GS and urbanization in the surrounding matrix on
   bird communities in the mid-sized city of Gottingen, Germany. We used
   the point-count method for bird observations in allotments and parks. To
   determine the level of urbanization, we calculated percentage of
   impervious surfaces around GSs. Increasing levels of urbanization around
   GSs had no effect on the species richness, functional traits or the
   community composition of birds. Nevertheless, we found that species
   richness and functional traits varied according to GS type. Parks had a
   greater species richness and were found to have more ground nesting and
   tropical migrant birds compared to allotments. We found more cavity
   nesting and resident birds in allotments. As different types of GS can
   contribute to the presence of different species and functional trait
   variations, their positive effect on bird species richness can be
   enhanced when they are present together in urban landscapes. Our
   findings suggest that green spaces with a high variety of local
   characteristics should be incorporated into urban planning designs in
   order to ensure diverse bird communities in cities.}},

Title = {{Life cycle impact assessment of semiconductor packaging technologies
   with emphasis on ball grid array}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{276}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Environmental impact assessment studies have completely and rapidly
   focused on the shift from economic to environmental competitiveness in
   semiconductor packaging industries under the trend of small size and
   diverse semiconductor products. This study has two main objectives,
   namely, (1) to adopt traditional life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) for
   investigating the environmental damage of three packaging technologies,
   namely, ball grid array (BGA), flip chip (FC), and lead frame (LF). Two
   commonly used materials in 2017, namely, gold and copper wires, were
   analyzed. The functional unit was defined on the basis of the packaging
   volume (1 mm(3)); (2) to identify influential parameters for developing
   two parametric LCIA equations for the BGA. Results show that the
   semiconductor back-end industry should gradually replace gold wires with
   copper wires without affecting the function of products and should
   promote the low impact packaging technology (LF) while satisfying the
   customer's demands. Tree influential parameters (packaging volume, wire
   mass, and lead counts) of LCIA are identified by regression analysis,
   and the lead count can be considered a worthwhile alternative parameter
   for allocation and establishing the parametric tool when the packaging
   volume of the product is unavailable. The parametric tool can reduce the
   time cost of collecting LCI data and avoid the analysis errors and
   uncertainty caused by the distribution. The research can serve as a
   guide for the PCRs (LCA-PCR) of the semiconductor industry for suitable
   alternative allocation principles and functional units. (c) 2020

Title = {{Insight into the influences of beta-hemihydrate and dihydrate gypsum on
   the properties and phase conversion of white calcium aluminate cement}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{263}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{It is still uncertain whether beta-hemihydrate and dihydrate gypsum
   influence the properties, especially the phase conversion, of white
   calcium aluminate cement (CAC). Therefore, in this study, we prepared
   CAC pastes/mortars containing beta-hemihydrate and dihydrate and
   comparatively assessed their setting times and compressive strengths.
   Simultaneously, the influence of beta-hemihydrate and dihydrate on their
   chemical shrinkage, hydration-heat, pore size distributions,
   crystalline, and thermogravimetric characteristics was investigated. It
   is interesting that 0.5\% beta-hemihydrate and dihydrate significantly
   postponed the setting, whereas more than 0.5\% beta-hemihydrate and
   dihydrate slightly prolonged the initial setting and significantly
   shortened the final setting. Both beta-hemihydrate and dihydrate
   decreased the compressive strength of CAC pastes hardened for 1 and 3
   days to different extents; however, CAC pastes with a beta-hemihydrate
   or dihydrate content less than 1\% exhibited a high compressive strength
   at 28 days. Beyond this dosage, the compressive strength of the
   specimens was found to reduce. In addition, CAC pastes containing more
   than 0.5\% beta-hemihydrate or dihydrate exhibited high chemical
   shrinkage over 3-12 h. Furthermore, beta-hemihydrate and dihydrate
   enhanced the gel micro and meso pores. They accelerated or decreased CAC
   hydration in the fast reaction and first deceleration periods, prolonged
   or shortened the induction period, enhanced or reduced the hydration
   heat before or after 12 h. These cases are closely associated to their
   contents. Their inclusion restricted CAHio formation while promoting the
   generation of C2AH8, AFm, and AH3 and conversion of CAHio to C3AH6 after
   3 days. Besides, there are some significant differences in their
   influence on the properties and phase conversion of CAC pastes. For
   these differences, CAC pastes/mortars with beta-hemihydrate and
   dihydrate presented different setting times and compressive strengths.

Abstract = {{In this work, we proposed a feasible method to prepare the Bi/Al

   Bi was uniformly doped into the silica matrix. The hydroxyl content of

   1000 to 1600 nm was obtained. The emission peak was centered at 1249 nm,
   and the corresponding FWHM was more than 400 nm. The results show that
   the laser additive manufacturing technology is promising to fabricate
   highly homogeneous Bi-doped core materials with broader emission band,

Title = {{Phosphorus recovery from synthetic biosolid digestion supernatant
   through lignin-induced struvite precipitation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{276}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Phosphorus recovery from wastewater is essential to resolve the problems
   of the fast depletion of phosphate rocks due to the increasing demand of
   phosphorus fertilizer and eutrophication caused by excessive phosphorus
   discharging from wastewater. In this study, the feasibility of adding
   lignin as seed materials to promote phosphorus recovery through struvite
   (NH4MgPO4 center dot 6H(2)O) crystallization from synthetic biosolid
   digestion supernatant was evaluated via batch experiments. Influencing
   factors including lignin dosage, Mg/P molar ratio, and pH were tested.
   Lignin addition enhanced phosphorus recovery by 44.6\% at a relatively
   low pH of 7.9 with Mg/P molar ratio of 1.5 and lignin dosage of 6 g/L,
   improved the quality of recovered struvite crystals by reducing the
   potential of co-precipitation. The phosphorus recovery improvement
   became less noticeable and the extent of reducing the potential of
   co-precipitation became more evident as pH increases from 7.9 to 9.5.
   The characterizations by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron
   microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and zeta potential
   analysis, combined with precipitation modeling by a thermodynamic model
   software (Visual MINTEQ) were done to understand the process.
   Struvite-lignin clusters were identified, which likely provide
   nucleation sites on lignin to enhance struvite crystallization. It can
   be concluded that the inclusion of Kraft lignin as a seeding material
   might be a sustainable strategy to enhance struvite formation, improve
   phosphorus recovery, and yield high-quality struvite. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Title = {{Sustainable electrochemical dyeing of indigo with Fe(II)-based complexes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{276}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{In order to avoid the intensive burden of sewage treatment in the
   traditional dyeing process of indigo caused by the heavy usage of sodium
   dithionite (Na2S2O4), an indirect electrochemical reduction dyeing
   method for denim fabrics was carried out. The indirect electrochemical
   reduction dyeing with different iron-based complexes was explored by
   cyclic voltammetry. In addition, the stability of the complex solution,
   the reduction potential of the dye solution, the rate of dye reduction
   (Re) and ferrous ion conversion (Xe) in the electrochemical process were
   investigated, which showed that the Fe(II)-DGS-Abal B complex containing
   ferrous sulfate, sodium gluconate and Abal B (a complexing agent with
   high alkali resistance and electrical conductivity based on
   triethanolamine) had stronger reducing capacity. Furthermore, orthogonal
   experiments and gray clustering analysis were utilized to optimize the
   indirect electrochemical dyeing process for denim fabric. Under the
   optimized electrochemical reduction dyeing process, the rate of dye
   reduction could be up to 91.23\% and the K/S value of dyed denim fabric
   could reach 14.75, which is 6.58\% higher than that of the traditional
   dyeing process. Besides, the dyeing depth is nearly invariable within 7
   times of cyclic dyeing and the dyeing liquid is more susceptible to
   biological and chemical degradation. Compared with the traditional
   reduction dyeing with Na2S2O4 at higher temperature, the electrochemical
   reduction dyeing strategy uses electrical energy to reduce indigo at
   room temperature, and the reduction medium could be sustainably utilized
   by the circulation pump after the cyclic electrochemical reduction
   dyeing is completed, which not only decreases the COD value of dyeing
   wastewater, but also saves 63.5\% of the economic cost. The eco-friendly
   electrochemical dyeing strategy presented here with obvious economic
   benefits could significantly contribute to enhance the sustainability of
   dyeing process for denim production. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The authors developed a three-dimensional variational (3-DVAR) aerosol
   extinction coefficient (AEC) and aerosol mass concentration (AMC) data
   assimilation (DA) system for aerosol variables in the Weather Research
   and Forecasting-Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model with the WRF-Chem using the
   Model for Simulating Aerosol Interactions and Chemistry (MOSAIC) scheme.
   They establish an AEC observation operator and its corresponding adjoint
   based on the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments
   (IMPROVE) equation and investigate the use of lidar AEC and surface AMC
   DA to forecast mass concentration (MC) profiles of PM2.5 (particulate
   matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 mu m) across China.
   Two sets of data were assimilated: AEC profiles captured by five
   conventional Mie scattering lidars (positioned in Beijing, Shijiazhuang,
   Taiyuan, Xuzhou, and Wuhu) and PM2.5 and PM10 MC data obtained from over
   1500 ground environmental monitoring stations across China. Three DA
   experiments (i.e., a PM2.5 (PM10) DA experiment, a lidar AEC DA
   experiment, and a simultaneous PM2.5 (PM10) and lidar AEC DA experiment)
   with a 12 h assimilation period and a 24 h forecast period were
   conducted. The PM2.5 (PM10) DA reduced the root mean square error (RMSE)
   of the surface PM2.5 MC in the initial field of the model by 38.6 mu g
   m(-3) (64.8 \%). When lidar AEC data were assimilated, this reduction
   was 10.5 mu g m(-3) (17.6 \%), and a 38.4 mu g m(-3) (64.4 \%) reduction
   occurred when the two data sets were assimilated simultaneously,
   although only five lidars were available within the simulation region
   (approximately 2.33 million km(2) in size). The RMSEs of the forecasted
   surface PM2.5 MC 24 h after the DA period in the three DA experiments
   were reduced by 6.1 mu g m(-3) (11.8 \%), 1.5 mu g m(-3) (2.9 \%), and
   6.5 mu g M-3 (12.6 \%), respectively, indicating that the assimilation
   and hence the optimization of the initial field have a positive effect
   on the PM2.5 MC forecast performance over a period of 24 h after the DA
   period.}},

Abstract = {{Stroke is an acute cerebrovascular disease caused by ruptured or blocked
   blood vessels. For the prevention of ischemic stroke, the coagulation
   state of blood and cerebrovascular protection should be considered. Our
   previous study has shown that salvianolic acid A (SAA), which is a
   water-soluble component from the root of Salvia Miltiorrhiza Bge,
   prevents thrombosis with a mild inhibitory effect on platelet
   aggregation. In this study we investigated the preventive effects of SAA
   on cerebrovascular endothelial injury caused by ischemia in vivo and
   oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in vitro, and explored the underlying
   mechanisms. An autologous thrombus stroke model was established in SD
   rats by electrocoagulation. SAA (10 mg/kg) was orally administered twice
   a day for 5 days before the operation. The rats were sacrificed at 24 h
   after the operation. We showed that pretreatment with SAA significantly
   improved the neurological deficits, intracerebral hemorrhage, BBB
   disruption, and vascular endothelial dysfunction as compared with model
   group. In human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs),
   pretreatment with SAA (10 mu M) significantly inhibited OGD-induced cell
   viability reduction and degradation of tight junction proteins (ZO-1,
   occludin, claudin-5). Furthermore, we found that SAA inhibited the
   upregulation of Src signaling pathway in vivo and vitro and reversed the
   increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) after ischemic
   stroke. In conclusion, our results suggest that SAA protects
   cerebrovascular endothelial cells against ischemia and OGD injury via
   suppressing Src signaling pathway. These findings show that pretreatment
   with SAA is a potential therapeutic strategy for the prevention of
   ischemic stroke.}},

Abstract = {{Employing a virtual screening approach, we identified the pyroglutamide
   moiety as a nonacid replacement for the cyclohexanecarboxylic acid group
   which, when coupled to our previously reported conformationally locked
   tricyclic core, provided potent and selective ROR gamma t inverse
   agonists. Structure-activity relationship optimization of the
   pyroglutamide moiety led to the identification of compound 18 as a
   potent and selective ROR gamma t inverse agonist, albeit with poor
   aqueous solubility. We took advantage of the tertiary carbinol group in
   18 to synthesize a phosphate prodrug, which provided good solubility,
   excellent exposures in mouse PK studies, and significant efficacy in a
   mouse model of psoriasis.}},

Title = {{Effect of rice husk ash on early hydration behavior of magnesium
   phosphate cement}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{263}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{The application of rice husk ash (RHA) on magnesium phosphate cement
   (MPC) can increase the rational utilization of resources and improve the
   properties of MPC. RHA with the characteristics of porous and high
   activity as admixture has a certain influence on the hydration behavior
   of MPC. In this research, rice husk is calcined and ground reasonably to
   improve the activity of RHA. The particle size distribution, structure
   and micromorphology of RHA were characterized via laser particle size
   analyzer, X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and scanning electron microscope
   (SEM). The effects of RHA on hydration behavior, setting time and early
   compressive strength (3 h, 1 d, 7 d) of MPC were researched. Results
   indicated that the setting time was shortened about 2 min with the
   addition of 7\% RHA. The compressive strength of RHA/MPC composites
   increased by 39.2\%, 39.7\% and 25.7\% incorporating with 5\% RHA at the
   age of 3 h, 1 d and 7 d. The hydration heat analysis (TAM Air) showed
   that RHA postpone the early hydration of MPC and cause a second
   exothermic peak. The XRD and thermal gravity analysis (TG/DTG) suggested
   the number of hydration products is increased with the introduction of
   RHA. The porosity level of RHA/ MPC composites was dropped through the
   mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP). RHA plays a positive role in
   providing the site of hydration reaction and an alkaline environment for
   the RHA/MPC composites. It can be known that the compactness of RHA/MPC
   composites was promoted through SEM observation. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Although drawing is frequently used during investigative interviews, few
   studies have explored the effectiveness of draw-and-talk techniques with
   very young children. In this article, we examined the effects of drawing
   on preschoolers' (3-6 years old) reports of self-experienced and
   non-experienced events. In Study I, we interviewed 83 preschoolers about
   a staged event. We did not observe any significant statement differences
   between children asked to draw-and-talk compared to a verbal-only
   condition. In Study II, we interviewed 25 preschoolers about a
   nonexperienced event. Twenty-one children initially denied the event.
   When asked if they could help the interviewer draw a person from the
   event, 13 (61.9\%) children complied with the request and eventually
   provided several false details. While drawing did not significantly
   increase the average number of details, exploratory findings indicated
   that drawing may have helped a subset of children. However, drawing
   might impair children's accuracy when suggestively interviewed about
   nonexperienced events.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL FIBERS}},
Abstract = {{In this study, biocomposites of HDPE/flax fibers in different
   formulations were developed and their tensile, 3-point bending, and
   morphological properties were extensively characterized. The interfacial
   bond in the fractured biocomposite samples was examined by scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM). While the thermal behavior of these novel
   HDPE/flax biocomposites was studied using DSC and ATG. The ratio of
   tested reinforcement by weight varies from 5\% to 20\% of natural flax
   fiber with different heating rates, namely 5 degrees C/min, 10 degrees
   C/min, and 20 degrees C/min. The results for the mechanical properties
   obtained such as the tensile and flexural strength revealed an increase
   of 24 to 35 MPa and 15.82 to 19.72 MPa, respectively, compared to neat
   HDPE. On the other hand, the thermal tests revealed that the heating
   rate has a pronounced effect on the thermal behavior of the materials
   studied by shifting the degradation range of biocomposites to high

Abstract = {{Purpose The annual quality assurance (QA) of Leksell Gamma Knife(R)
   (LGK) systems are typically performed using films. Film is a good
   candidate for small field dosimetry due to its high spatial resolution
   and availability. However, there are multiple challenges with using
   film; film does not provide real-time measurement and requires
   batch-specific calibration. Our findings show that active detector-based
   QA can simplify the procedure and save time without loss of accuracy.
   Methods Annual QA tests for a LGK Icon (TM) system were performed using
   both film-based and filmless techniques. Output calibration, relative
   output factors (ROF), radiation profiles, sector uniformity/source
   counting, and verification of the unit center point (UCP) and radiation
   focal point (RFP) coincidence tests were performed. Radiochromic films,
   two ionization chambers, and a synthetic diamond detector were used for
   the measurements. Results were compared and verified with the treatment
   planning system (TPS).
   Results The measured dose rate of the LGK Icon was within 0.4\% of the
   TPS value set at the time of commissioning using an ionization chamber.
   ROF for the 8 and 4-mm collimators were found to be 0.3\% and 1.8\%
   different from TPS values using the MicroDiamond detector and 2.6\% and
   1.9\% different for film, respectively. Excellent agreement was found
   between TPS and measured dose profiles using the MicroDiamond detector
   which was within 1\%/1 mm vs 2\%/1 mm for film. Sector uniformity was
   found to be within 1\% for all eight sectors measured using an
   ionization chamber. Verification of UCP and RFP coincidence using the
   MicroDiamond detector and pinprick film test was within 0.3 mm at
   isocenter for both.
   Conclusion The annual QA of a LGK Icon was successfully performed by
   employing filmless techniques. Comparable results were obtained using
   radiochromic films. Utilizing active detectors instead of films
   simplifies the QA process and saves time without loss of accuracy.}},

Title = {{Vacuum loops in light-front field theory}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS LETTERS B}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{811}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate that vacuum diagrams in the genuine light front (LF)
   field theory are non-zero, in spite of simple kinematical
   counter-arguments (positivity and conservation of the LF momentum p(+),
   absence of Fourier zero mode). Using the light-front Hamiltonian
   (time-ordered) perturbation theory, the vacuum amplitudes in
   self-interacting scalar lambda phi(3)(1 + 1) and lambda phi(4)(1 + 1)
   models are obtained as p = 0 limit of the associated self-energy
   diagrams, where pis the external momentum. They behave as C
   lambda(2)mu(-2) in D=2, with mu being the scalar-field mass, or diverge
   in D=4, in agreement with the usual ``equal-time{''} form of field
   theory, and with the same value of the constant C. The simplest vacuum
   diagram with two internal lines is analyzed in detail displaying the
   subtle role of the small k(+) region and its connection to the p = 0
   limit. However, the vacuum bubbles in the genuine light-front field
   theory are nonvanishing not due to the Fourier mode carrying LF momentum
   k(+) = 0 (as is the case in the LF evaluation of the covariant Feynman
   diagrams), in full accord with the observation that the LF perturbation
   theory formula breaks down in the exact zero-mode case. This is made
   explicit using the DLCQ method - the discretized (finite-volume) version
   of the theory, where the light-front zero modes are manifestly absent,
   but the vacuum amplitudes still converge to their continuum-theory
   values with the increasing ``harmonic resolution{''} K. (C) 2020 The

Title = {{Balancing Access Control and Privacy for Data Deduplication via
   Functional Encryption}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Data deduplication serves as an effective way to optimize the storage
   occupation and the bandwidth consumption over clouds. As for the
   security of deduplication mechanism, users' privacy and accessibility
   are of utmost concern since data are outsourced. However, the
   functionality of redundancy removal and the indistinguishability of
   deduplication labels are naturally incompatible, which bring about a lot
   of threats on data security. Besides, the access control of sharing
   copies may lead to infringement on users' attributes and cumbersome
   query overheads. To balance the usability with the confidentiality of
   deduplication labels and securely realize an elaborate access structure,
   a novel data deduplication scheme is proposed in this paper. Briefly
   speaking, we drew support from learning with errors (LWE) to make sure
   that the deduplication labels are only differentiable during the
   duplication check process. Instead of authority matching, the proof of
   ownership (PoW) is then implemented under the paradigm of inner
   production. Since the deduplication label is light-weighted and the
   inner production is easy to carry out, our scheme is more efficient in
   terms of computation and storage. Security analysis also indicated that
   the deduplication labels are distinguishable only for duplication check,
   and the probability of falsifying a valid ownership is negligible.}},

   containing fly ash and calcium carbonate whiskers induced by high
   temperature}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{263}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{A novel kind of cement blend with high temperature resistance and
   favorable sustainability was developed in this paper. The physical and
   chemical changes due to high temperature exposure were examined in this
   sustainable cement paste containing fly ash (FA) and aragonite calcium
   carbonate whiskers (CW) as supplementary cementitious materials. High
   flexural strength is demonstrated before 400 degrees C because FA has
   pozzolanic effect, self-cementitious properties and potentials to react
   with CW under hydrothermal condition. When the exposure temperature is
   above 400 degrees C, especially above 800 degrees C, high residual
   properties and less deterioration are observed in flexural and
   compressive strengths and elastic modulus, mainly because FA is involved
   in the sintering process and formation of ceramic phases. In summary,
   the sustainable cementitious composites studied in this paper are very
   promising to have high temperature resistance to reduce fire damage on
   constructions and at the same time lower carbon dioxide footprint of
   cement manufacture. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   Neurocognitive outcomes are frequently used as indicators of real-world
   functioning in schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD). These test
   results may be influenced by individual differences, such as affective
   dispositions. Here we investigate the relationship between positive and
   negative affect and neuropsychological test scores in a large,
   mixed-gender, population based group of participants without co-morbid
   substance abuse.
   Materials and methods
   We assessed 129 male and female SSD patients with the Positive and
   Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and a comprehensive neuropsychological
   test battery.
   Results and conclusions
   The neuropsychological test scores were mainly predicted by age and
   gender, with small contributions from negative psychosis symptoms. There
   was a statistically significant relationship between Positive Affect and
   processing speed and between Negative Affect and verbal memory and
   executive function. However, the level of neurocognitive function
   variance explained by these affects was only 5\%. Thus, the
   neurocognitive test results were not associated with trait affect in any
   clinically significant manner. This adds to previous findings of no
   relationship between affective dispositions and psychosis symptom
   variables in our participants. We suggest that affective traits
   constitute an independent dimension that may influence well-being,
   coping, and real-life outcome in SSD patients directly, and not through
   neurocognitive function.}},

   invertebrate communities}},
Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{656}},
Pages = {{227-238}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Temperate subtidal reefs are increasingly exposed to gradual warming and
   short periods of high temperatures (marine heatwaves; MHWs). These
   pressures can directly and indirectly affect the mobile invertebrate
   communities on these reefs. We investigate changes in mobile
   invertebrate communities from benthic surveys 15 yr apart (1999-2001 vs
   2016-2019), spanning a 4 degrees latitudinal gradient in Western
   Australia (30-34 degrees S), expecting the biggest changes to the
   communities in the lower latitudes, where the cumulative effect of MHWs
   and warming is largest. The urchins Centrostephanus tenuispinus
   (warmtemperate affinity) and Phyllacanthus irregularis (cool temperate
   affinity) showed trends toward opposite responses over time; while P.
   irregularis densities declined (non-significantly at all sites), C.
   tenuispinus densities increased (significantly at one of 3 sites). The
   magnitude of the responses appeared to decrease with increasing
   latitude, with C. tenuispinus recorded in significantly higher densities
   only at the lowest latitude location. Neither the densities, nor change
   in density over time of cool temperate gastropod Lunella torquatus and
   urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma reflected a latitudinal gradient,
   suggesting other localized factors play a larger role in determining
   abundances of these species. However, size distributions of L. torquatus
   populations at the lower latitude locations were clearly impacted by the
   2011 MHW, while those at higher latitudes remained relatively
   consistent. Overall, the biggest changes over time were seen at the
   warmedge of the temperate ecosystem. As temperatures continue to rise,
   the magnitude of these changes is not only expected to increase, but
   also to occur at higher latitudes.}},

Abstract = {{Subglacial water plays an important role in ice sheet dynamics and
   stability. Subglacial lakes are often located at the onset of ice
   streams and have been hypothesised to enhance ice flow downstream by
   lubricating the ice- bed interface. The most recent subglacial-lake
   inventory of Antarctica mapped nearly 400 lakes, of which similar to 14
   \% are found in West Antarctica. Despite the potential importance of
   subglacial water for ice dynamics, there is a lack of detailed
   subglacial-water characterisation in West Antarctica. Using radio-echo
   sounding data, we analyse the ice-bed interface to detect subglacial
   lakes. We report 33 previously uncharted subglacial lakes and present a
   systematic analysis of their physical properties. This represents a
   similar to 40 \% increase in subglacial lakes in West Antarctica.
   Additionally, a new digital elevation model of basal topography of the
   Ellsworth Subglacial Highlands was built and used to create a
   hydropotential model to simulate the subglacial hydrological network.
   This allows us to characterise basal hydrology, determine subglacial
   water catchments and assess their connectivity. We show that the
   simulated subglacial hydrological catchments of the Rutford Ice Stream,
   Pine Island Glacier and Thwaites Glacier do not correspond to their ice
   surface catchments.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundPancreatitis is a critical public health problem, and the
   burden of pancreatitis is increasing. We report the rates and trends of
   the prevalence, incidence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) for
   pancreatitis at the global, regional, and national levels in 195
   countries and territories from 1990 to 2017, stratified by sex, age, and
   sociodemographic index (SDI).MethodsData on pancreatitis were available
   from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study
   (GBD) 2017. Numbers and age-standardized prevalence, incidence, and
   YLDs' rates per 100,000 population were estimated through a systematic
   analysis of modeled data from the 2017 GBD study. Both acute and chronic
   pancreatitis are being modeled separately in the GBD 2017; however, our
   data show acute and chronic pancreatitis together. Estimates were
   reported with uncertainty intervals (UIs).ResultsGlobally, in 2017, the
   age-standardized rates were 76.2 (95\% UIs 68.9 to 83.4), 20.6 (19.2 to
   22.1), and 4.5 (2.3 to 7.6) per 100,000 population for the point
   prevalence, incidence, and YLDs, respectively. From 1990 to 2017, the
   percent changes in the age-standardized prevalence and YLDs rates
   increased, whereas the age-standardized incidence rate decreased. The
   global prevalence increased with age up to 60-64years and 44-49years in
   females and males, respectively, and then decreased, with no significant
   difference between females and males. The global prevalence rate
   increased with age, peaking in the 95+ age group, with no difference
   between sexes. Generally, positive correlation between age-standardized
   YLDs and SDIs at the regional and national levels was observed. Slovakia
   (297.7 {[}273.4 to 325.3]), Belgium (274.3 {[}242.6 to 306.5]), and
   Poland (266.7 {[}248.2 to 284.4]) had the highest age-standardized
   prevalence rates in 2017. Taiwan (Province of China) (104.2\% {[}94.8 to
   115.2\%]), Maldives (72.4\% {[}66.5 to 79.2\%]), and Iceland (64.8\%
   {[}57.2 to 72.9\%]) had the largest increases in age-standardized
   prevalence rates from 1990 to 2017.ConclusionsPancreatitis is a major
   public health issue worldwide. The age-standardized prevalence and YLDs
   rates increased, but the age-standardized incidence rate decreased from
   1990 to 2017. Improving the quality of pancreatitis health data in all
   regions and countries is strongly recommended for better monitoring the
   burden of pancreatitis.}},

Title = {{Assessing the bond strength of Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer (GFRP)
   bars in Portland Cement Concrete fabricated with seawater through
   pullout tests}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{263}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) is the most used construction material
   worldwide and its use is expected to increase in the future. PCC
   intensively uses two main natural resources, namely aggregates and fresh
   water. The concrete industry consumes about 2 billion tons of potable
   water annually. Due to climate change, rapid population growth, and
   industrial activity, there is a scarcity of fresh water; by 2025 more
   than half of the world's population will be living in water-stressed
   areas. In contrast, there is abundant seawater in the world, which
   represents about 97.5\% of the total Earth's water. However, the
   incorporation of seawater in PCC is a complex problem because the
   sulfate ions can affect the microstructure durability and the chloride
   ions can accelerate reinforcing steel corrosion, which can compromise
   the structural integrity. Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) bars may
   be used as an alternative reinforcing material to avoid corrosion. This
   paper assesses the bond strength of two types of GFRP bars with either a
   sand-coating or spiral grooves using a standard pullout test. Control
   samples were prepared using concrete made with potable water and
   compared with companion specimens made with seawater. Parallel
   experimental programs were carried out in Chile and Canada, with a total
   of 70 test specimens. The results suggest that there is no statistically
   significant difference in the short-term (28 day) bond strength of GFRP
   bars in seawater concrete compared to normal concrete. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Title = {{Emerging climate change-related public health challenges in Africa: A
   case study of the heat-health vulnerability of informal settlement
   residents in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{747}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Heat has the potential to become one of the most significant public
   health impacts of climate change in the coming decades. Increases in
   temperature have been linked to both increasing mortality and morbidity.
   Cities have been recognized as areas of particular vulnerability to
   heat's impacts on health, and marginalized groups, such as the poor,
   appear to have higher heat-related morbidity and mortality. Little
   research has examined the heat vulnerability of urban informal
   settlements residents in Africa, even though surface temperatures across
   Africa are projected to increase at a rate faster than the global
   average. This paper addresses this knowledge gap through a mixed-methods
   analysis of the heat-health vulnerability of informal settlement
   residents in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The heat exposure, sensitivity and
   adaptive capacity of informal settlement residents were assessed through
   a combination of climate analyses, semi-structured interviews with local
   government actors and informal settlement residents, unstructured
   interviews with health sector respondents, a health impacts literature
   review, and a stakeholder engagement workshop. The results suggest that
   increasing temperatures due to climate change will likely be a
   significant risk to human health in Dar es Salaam, even though the city
   does not reach extreme temperature conditions, because informal
   settlement residents have high exposure, high sensitivity and low
   adaptive capacity to heat, and because the heat-health relationship is
   currently an under-prioritized policy issue. While numerous urban
   planning approaches can play a key role in increasing the resilience of
   citizens to heat, Dar es Salaam's past and current growth and
   development patterns greatly complicate the implementation and
   enforcement of such approaches. For African cities, the findings
   highlight an urgent need for more research on the vulnerability and
   resilience of residents to heat-health impacts, because many African
   cities are likely to present similar characteristics to those in Dar es
   Salaam that increase resident's vulnerability. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{The spectrum of the non-backtracking matrix plays a crucial role in
   determining various structural and dynamical properties of networked
   systems, ranging from the threshold in bond percolation and
   non-recurrent epidemic processes, to community structure, to node
   importance. Here we calculate the largest eigenvalue of the
   non-backtracking matrix and the associated non-backtracking centrality
   for uncorrelated random networks, finding expressions in excellent
   agreement with numerical results. We show however that the same formulas
   do not work well for many real-world networks. We identify the mechanism
   responsible for this violation in the localization of the
   non-backtracking centrality on network subgraphs whose formation is
   highly unlikely in uncorrelated networks, but rather common in
   real-world structures. Exploiting this knowledge we present an heuristic
   generalized formula for the largest eigenvalue, which is remarkably
   accurate for all networks of a large empirical dataset. We show that
   this newly uncovered localization phenomenon allows to understand the
   failure of the message-passing prediction for the percolation threshold
   in many real-world structures.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Triple therapy consisting of a drug association including an
   inhaled corticosteroid, a long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist and
   a long-acting beta(2)-adrenergic agonist, delivered via a single device,
   can be a valuable treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
   (COPD) patients experiencing frequent disease exacerbations. Objectives:
   The aim of this real-life, single-center, observational study was to
   evaluate, in 44 COPD patients with recurrent exacerbations, the effects
   of the triple inhaled therapy combining fluticasone furoate,
   umeclidinium, and vilanterol (FF/UMEC/VI). Methods: Within such a
   therapeutic context, several clinical and lung functional parameters
   were considered at baseline and after 24 weeks of treatment with
   combined inhaled triple therapy. Results: With respect to baseline,
   after 24 weeks of treatment with FF/UMEC/VI, significant changes were
   recorded with regard to Modified British Medical Research Council (p <
   0.0001) and COPD Assessment Test (p < 0.0001) scores, COPD exacerbations
   (p < 0.001), forced expiratory volume in the first second (p < 0.001),
   residual volume (p < 0.01), forced mid-expiratory flow between 25 and
   75\% of FVC (p < 0.0001), inspiratory capacity (p < 0.01), forced vital
   capacity (p < 0.05), and peak expiratory flow (p < 0.0001). Moreover, in
   a subgroup of 28 patients, a significant increase of diffusion lung
   capacity (p < 0.01) was also detected. Conclusions: In conclusion, our
   real-life results suggest that triple inhaled therapy with FF/UMEC/VI,
   when given to COPD patients with frequent exacerbations, is able to
   positively impact on dyspnea and global health status as well as to
   significantly decrease COPD exacerbations and improve airflow limitation
   and lung hyperinflation.}},

Title = {{Revisiting the hypertriton lifetime puzzle}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS LETTERS B}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{811}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Conflicting values of the hypertriton (H-3(Lambda)) lifetime were
   extracted in recent relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments. The
   ALICE Collaboration's reported (3)(Lambda H) lifetime tau(H-3(A)) is
   compatible within measurement uncertainties with the free Lambda
   lifetime tau(Lambda), as naively expected for a loosely bound Lambda
   hyperon in tau(Lambda), whereas STAR's reported range of
   tau(H-3(Lambda)) values is considerably shorter: tau(STAR)
   (H-3(Lambda))similar to(0.4-0.7)tau(Lambda). This H-3(Lambda) lifetime
   puzzle is revisited theoretically, using H-3(Lambda) three-body
   wavefunctions generated in a chiral effective field theory approach to
   calculate the decay rate Gamma(H-3(Lambda) -> He-3 + pi(-)). Significant
   but opposing contributions arise from Sigma NN admixtures in H-3(Lambda)
   and from pi(-)-He-3 final-state interaction. Evaluating the inclusive
   pi(-) decay rate Gamma(pi)-(H-3(Lambda)) via a branching ratio
   Gamma(H-3(Lambda)-> He-3+pi(-))/Gamma(pi)- (H-3(Lambda)) determined in
   helium bubble-chamber experiments, and adding Gamma(pi 0)(H-3(Lambda))
   through the Delta I = 1/2 rule, we derive tau(H-3(Lambda)) assuming
   several different values of the Lambda separation energy B-Lambda
   (H-3(Lambda)). It is concluded that each of ALICE and STAR reported
   tau(H-3(Lambda)) intervals implies its own constraint on B-Lambda
   (H-3(Lambda)): B-Lambda less than or similar to 0.1 MeV for ALICE,
   B-Lambda greater than or similar to 0.2 MeV for STAR. (C) 2020 The

Title = {{Linking household surveys and facility assessments: a comparison of
   geospatial methods using nationally representative data from Malawi}},
Journal = {{POPULATION HEALTH METRICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Background Linking facility and household surveys through geographic
   methods is a popular technique to draw conclusions about the
   relationship between health services and population health outcomes at
   local levels. These methods are useful tools for measuring effective
   coverage and tracking progress towards Universal Health Coverage, but
   are understudied. This paper compares the appropriateness of several
   geospatial methods used for linking individuals (within displaced survey
   cluster locations) to their source of family planning (at undisplaced
   health facilities) at a national level. Methods In Malawi, geographic
   methods linked a population health survey, rural clusters from the
   Woman's Questionnaire of the 2015 Malawi Demographic and Health Survey
   (MDHS 2015), to Malawi's national health facility census to understand
   the service environment where women receive family planning services.
   Individuals from MDHS 2015 clusters were linked to health facilities
   through four geographic methods: (i) closest facility, (ii) buffer (5
   km), (iii) administrative boundary, and (iv) a newly described
   theoretical catchment area method. Results were compared across metrics
   to assess the number of unlinked clusters (data lost), the number of
   linkages per cluster (precision of linkage), and the number of women
   linked to their last source of modern contraceptive (appropriateness of
   linkage). Results The closest facility and administrative boundary
   methods linked every cluster to at least one facility, while the 5-km
   buffer method left 288 clusters (35.3\%) unlinked. The theoretical
   catchment area method linked all but one cluster to at least one
   facility (99.9\% linked). Closest facility, 5-km buffer, administrative
   boundary, and catchment methods linked clusters to 1.0, 1.4, 21.1, and
   3.3 facilities on average, respectively. Overall, the closest facility,
   5-km buffer, administrative boundary, and catchment methods
   appropriately linked 64.8\%, 51.9\%, 97.5\%, and 88.9\% of women to
   their last source of modern contraceptive, respectively. Conclusions Of
   the methods studied, the theoretical catchment area linking method loses
   a marginal amount of population data, links clusters to a relatively low
   number of facilities, and maintains a high level of appropriate
   linkages. This linking method is demonstrated at scale and can be used
   to link individuals to qualities of their service environments and
   better understand the pathways through which interventions impact
   health.}},

Abstract = {{Potassium-solubilizing bacteria (KSB) are often used in the field of
   vegetable and horticultural crops. In this study, a strain of Bacillus
   pseudomycoides was used as the KSB strain and different combinations of
   muriate of potash (MoP) and mica waste (MW) along with that strain were
   applied in soil to evaluate its effect on exchangeable K content in soil
   and yield of tea shoots. The objective of this experiment was to
   evaluate the possibility of applying an indigenous KSB strain and MW
   combination for reducing doses of MoP during cultivation of perennial
   crops like tea. The study over two consecutive years revealed that
   cumulative tea production of some of the applied treatments was
   significantly higher than that of recommended MoP treatment. Application
   of KSB and MW in the first split instead of MoP recorded higher
   exchangeable K content in soil during August to October, especially in
   the second year of the study. The study confirmed B. pseudomycoides can
   be used as a KSB biofertilizer in soil and application of MW and KSB
   combined replacing MoP in the first split could be economical as well as
   improving K use-efficiency in soil and increased yield and K-uptake by
   the plants.}},

Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors are characterized by high
   tumor mutation burden and responsiveness to checkpoint blockade. We
   identified tumor-specific frameshifts encoding multiple epitopes that
   originated from indel mutations shared among patients with MSI-H
   endometrial, colorectal, and stomach cancers. Epitopes derived from
   these shared frameshifts have high population occurrence rates, wide
   presence in many tumor subclones, and are predicted to bind to the most
   frequent MHC alleles in MSI-H patient cohorts. Neoantigens arising from
   these mutations are distinctly unlike self and viral antigens,
   signifying novel groups of potentially highly immunogenic tumor
   antigens. We further confirmed the immunogenicity of frameshift peptides
   in T cell stimulation experiments using blood mononuclear cells isolated
   from both healthy donors and MSI-H cancer patients. Our study uncovers
   the widespread occurrence and strong immunogenicity of tumor-specific
   antigens derived from shared frameshift mutations in MSI-H cancer and
   Lynch syndrome patients, suitable for the design of common
   ``off-the-shelf{''} cancer vaccines.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Camouflage is the most common form of antipredator defense, and is a
   textbook example of natural selection. How animals' appearances prevent
   detection or recognition is well studied, but the role of prey behavior
   has received much less attention. Here we report a series of experiments
   with twig-mimicking larvae of the American peppered moth Biston
   betularia that test the long-held view that prey have evolved postures
   that enhance their camouflage, and establish how food availability and
   ambient temperature affect these postures. We found that predators took
   longer to attack larvae that were resting in a twig-like posture than
   larvae resting flat against a branch. Larvae that were chilled or food
   restricted (manipulations intended to energetically stress larvae)
   adopted a less twig-like posture than larvae that were fed ad libitum.
   Our findings provide clear evidence that animals gain antipredator
   benefits from postural camouflage, and suggest that benefits may come at
   an energetic cost that animals are unwilling or unable to pay under some
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Wilson's disease (WD) is caused by the excessive accumulation of copper
   in the brain and liver, leading to death if not diagnosed early. WD
   shows its prevalence as white matter hyperintensity (WMH) in MRI scans.
   It is challenging and tedious to classify WD against controls when
   comparing visually, primarily due to subtle differences in WMH. This
   Letter presents a computer-aided design-based automated classification
   strategy that uses optimised transfer learning (TL) utilising two novel
   paradigms known as (i) MobileNet and (ii) the Visual Geometric Group-19
   (VGG-19). Further, the authors benchmark TL systems against a machine
   learning (ML) paradigm. Using four-fold augmentation, VGG-19 is superior
   to MobileNet demonstrating accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) pairs
   as 95.46 +/- 7.70\%, 0.932 (p < 0.0001) and 86.87 <plus/minus> 2.23\%,
   0.871 (p < 0.0001), respectively. Further, MobileNet and VGG-19 showed
   an improvement of 3.4 and 13.5\%, respectively, when benchmarked against
   the ML-based soft classifier - Random Forest.}},

Abstract = {{Incorporating insulation material in the building envelope is one of the
   simple yet effective passive techniques aimed at mitigating the energy
   consumption in buildings. The development and utilization of sustainable
   materials with heat insulating capacity as an alternative to synthetic
   insulations is a promising path towards reduced carbon footprint of
   buildings. The insulation potential of straw, an agricultural waste, in
   the context of the wide-ranging climate of India is the focus of the
   current work. Cooling and/or heating load analysis over 24 h of a
   representative summer and winter day is performed through transient
   numerical analysis for five climatic zones of India. Three building
   envelope configurations possible with retrofitting straw insulation
   (placed on the outside or inside or equally on either side) over
   existing walls/roof are compared. Four different thicknesses (10, 20, 30
   and 40 cm) of the straw insulation are considered for analysis.
   Recommendations of envelope configuration with insulation are proposed
   based on energy and cost savings for the different climatic zones.
   Overall, the case of straw insulation split on either side performs the
   best. Energy savings in the range of 67-96\% is achievable with the
   addition of just 10 cm thick straw across different climatic zones. The
   work also presents a comparison of the straw envelope performance
   against different types of envelopes based on sustainable materials
   found in literature. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the possible effects on objective work performance
   while using two types of dynamic office workstations (DOWs). 20
   participants each used one type with three intensities (seated, light,
   moderate) and completed a task battery assessing cognitive performance
   and office work with two levels of complexity. Repeated measures MANOVA
   showed a significant interaction effect for work performance between the
   type of workstation and intensity for the simple level and a significant
   main effect for intensity for the complex level. Comparing the types of
   DOWs to each other, accuracy of text processing differed when working
   sedentary. Using both devices with light and moderate intensity had a
   significant detrimental effect on mouse tasks compared to working
   sedentary, but none comparing the intensities. No further results
   indicated neither a detrimental nor an enhancing effect of using DOWs on
   cognitive performance and office-work related tasks, regardless of the
   intensity of use or the task complexity.
   Practitioner Summary: By using DOWs, light physical activity can be
   integrated while working at a desk. Results showed that using different
   types of DOWs with different intensities does have a detrimental effect
   on tasks requiring a high motor control, but not on cognitive or further
   office work-related tasks of various complexity.}},

Title = {{Exposing the Barcoding Void: An Integrative Approach to Study
   Snail-Borne Parasites in a One Health Context}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Trematodes are snail-borne parasites of major zoonotic importance that
   infect millions of people and animals worldwide and frequently hybridize
   with closely related species. Therefore, it is desirable to study
   trematodiases in a One Health framework, where human and animal
   trematodes are considered equally important. It is within this framework
   that we set out to study the snail and trematode communities in four
   artificial lakes and an abattoir in Zimbabwe. Trematode infections in
   snails were detected through multiplex PCR protocols. Subsequently, we
   identified snails by sequencing a partial mitochondrial cytochrome c
   oxidase subunit I (COI) fragment, and trematodes (adults from the
   abattoir and larval stages detected in snails) using COI and nuclear
   rDNA markers. Of the 1,674 collected snails, 699 were molecularly
   analyzed, in which we identified 12 snail and 19 trematode species.
   Additionally, three parasite species were sampled from the abattoir.
   Merely four trematode species were identified to species level through
   COI-based barcoding. Moreover, identification of members of the
   superfamilies Opisthorchioidea and Plagiorchioidea required a
   phylogenetic inference using the highly conserved 18S rDNA marker, as no
   related COI reference sequences were present in public databases. These
   barcoding challenges demonstrate a severe barcoding void in the
   available databases, which can be attributed to the neglected status of
   trematodiases. Adding to this, many available sequences cannot be used
   as different studies use different markers. To fill this gap, more
   studies on African trematodes, using a standardized COI barcoding
   region, are desperately needed.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{276}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Ascertaining cleaner production and sustainability is a major issue in
   the developed and developing world; income and international trade are
   the predominant factors behind this. This article explores the
   heterogeneous impacts of export product diversification, extensive
   margin, and intensive margins on the CO2 emissions for developing and
   developed countries. To this end, the authors analyze the annual data of
   variables from 1971 to 2014 and employ unrestricted fixed effects and
   system GMM to solve the research problem. The empirics suggest that all
   three indicators of export diversification significantly reduce CO2
   emissions in 63 developed and developing countries as a global sample.
   The fixed effect models reveal that product diversification and
   intensive margin have a negative and significant impact in developed
   economies. The negative impacts of product diversification show that
   economic sophistication is an important tool to reduce emissions.
   Further, the Chow test proved the statistical difference between
   developed and developing economies, which contributes to policy
   recommendations. Based on the empirical outcomes, the study suggests
   innovative policies for cleaner production and industrial manufacturing
   purposes, making the policies more effective in achieving Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDGs). (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoparticles that functionally mimic the activity of metal-containing
   enzymes (metallo-nanozymes) are of therapeutic importance for treating
   various diseases. However, it is still not clear whether such nanozymes
   can completely substitute the function of natural enzymes in living
   cells. In this work, we show for the first time that a cerium vanadate
   (CeVO4) nanozyme can substitute the function of superoxide dismutase 1
   and 2 (SOD1 and SOD2) in the neuronal cells even when the natural enzyme
   is down-regulated by specific gene silencing. The nanozyme prevents the
   mitochondrial damage in SOD1- and SOD2-depleted cells by regulating the
   superoxide levels and restores the physiological levels of the
   anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. Furthermore, the nanozyme
   effectively prevents the mitochondrial depolarization, leading to a
   significant improvement in the cellular levels of ATP under oxidative

Abstract = {{Single-channel speech enhancement in highly non-stationary noise
   conditions is a very challenging task, especially when interfering
   speech is included in the noise. Deep learning-based approaches have
   notably improved the performance of speech enhancement algorithms under
   such conditions, but still introduce speech distortions if strong noise
   suppression shall be achieved. We propose to address this problem by
   using a two-stage approach, first performing noise suppression and
   subsequently restoring natural sounding speech, using specifically
   chosen neural network topologies and loss functions for each task. A
   mask-based long short-term memory (LSTM) network is employed for noise
   suppression and speech restoration is performed via spectral mapping
   with a convolutional encoder-decoder network (CED). The proposed method
   improves speech quality (PESQ) over state-of-the-art single-stage
   methods by about 0.1 points for unseen highly non-stationary noise types
   including interfering speech. Furthermore, it is able to increase
   intelligibility in low-SNR conditions and consistently outperforms all
   reference methods.}},

Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{263}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Reinforced concrete and several other building materials deteriorate
   during their service life. Almost all deterioration processes are
   related to moisture. For understanding those processes, knowing the
   exact amount of the moisture content and the moisture transport
   characteristics is crucial. In fact, the moisture transport in porous
   materials is a two-phase flow; consisting of the vapour and the liquid
   phase. The two corresponding parameters are the diffusion coefficient
   and the hydraulic conductivity. By means of an inverse approach, these
   two coefficients are experimentally determined. The moisture transport
   of eight different screed types during hydration and evaporation is
   monitored based on embedded humidity sensors. The measured humidity
   profiles are converted into a pore saturation by adapting the approach
   of Hillerborg to the measured pore volume distribution. The summation of
   all pore saturations yields the total moisture content including the
   ink-bottle effect during desorption. The pore volume distribution was
   determined by mercury intrusion porosimetry as well as by gas
   adsorption. The measurement of the humidity and the pore saturation in
   the entire sample enables to invert the mass balance in order to extract
   the diffusion coefficient and the hydraulic conductivity. The determined
   diffusion coefficients of the eight investigated screeds are between
   2.98.10(-8)m(2)s (1) and 3.08 10(-7)m(2)s (1). (C) 2020 The Author.

Abstract = {{Background Esthesioneuroblastoma (ENB) is a rare malignant neoplasm.
   Currently, no consistent and universal staging system for ENB exists.
   The aim of this study is to propose a TNM-based classification.
   Subjects and methods Hundred and forty-two patients from our
   institution, with ENB pathologically confirmed between July 1978 and
   December 2018, were reviewed. All patients were restaged according to
   the Kadish stage, Morita stage and American Joint Committee on Cancer
   (AJCC) T classification from clinical and radiological data.
   Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were performed
   to determine the impact of various factors. The goodness-of-fit and
   predictive accuracy of the different staging systems were calculated
   using R software.
   Results The median follow-up time was 57 months (range: 4-229 months).
   According to the Kadish system, the 5-year overall survival (OS) for
   patients with stage A, B and C was 100\%, 83.6\% and 64.2\%,
   respectively (P = .055). With respect to the Morita classification,
   5-year OS for stages A, B, C and D was 100\%, 83.6\%, 70.7\% and 50.0\%,
   respectively (P = .004). Analysis based on the proposed staging model
   demonstrated 5-year OS for stage I, II, III and IV disease was 100\%,
   88.9\%, 75.9\% and 49.0\%, respectively (P < .001). In separate
   multivariate Cox regression models, only the novel staging system
   exhibited independent effects on OS (P = .004); the Akaike information
   criterion and Harrell's concordance index were also superior to those
   calculated for the Kadish or Morita systems.
   Conclusions The proposed TNM-based staging system offers an improved
   prognostic assessment for patients with ENB. Further verification and
   refinement from additional dataset application is required.}},

Abstract = {{Loss of biodiversity can affect transmission of infectious diseases in
   at least two ways: by altering host and vector abundance or by
   influencing host and vector behaviour. We used a large herbivore
   exclusion experiment to investigate the effects of wildlife loss on the
   abundance and feeding behaviour of mosquito vectors and to explore
   consequences for vector-borne disease transmission. Large herbivore loss
   affected both mosquito abundance and blood-feeding behaviour. For Aedes
   mcintoshi, the dominant mosquito species in our study and a primary
   vector of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), abundance decreased with large
   herbivore loss, while blood feeding on humans increased. Despite an
   elevated human biting rate in the absence of large herbivores, we
   estimated that the potential for RVFV transmission to humans doubles in
   the presence of large herbivores. These results demonstrate that
   multiple effects of biodiversity loss on vectors can lead to
   counterintuitive outcomes for human disease risk.}},

   Computational Model of Coupled Myocytes}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{A wide range of arrhythmogenic phenotypes have been associated with
   heterogeneous mechanical dyskinesis. Pro-arrhythmic effects are often
   associated with dysregulated intra-cellular calcium handling, especially
   via the development of intra- and inter-cellular calcium waves.
   Experimental evidence suggests that mechanical strain can contribute to
   the generation and maintenance of these calcium waves via a variety of
   mechano-electric coupling mechanisms. Most model studies of
   mechano-electric coupling mechanisms have been focused on
   mechano-sensitive ion channels, even though experimental studies have
   shown that intra- and inter-cellular calcium waves triggered by
   mechanical perturbations are likely to be more prevalent pro-arrhythmic
   mechanisms in the diseased heart. A one-dimensional strongly coupled
   computational model of electromechanics in rabbit ventricular
   cardiomyocytes showed that specific myocyte stretch sequences can
   modulate the susceptibility threshold for delayed after-depolarizations.
   In simulations of mechanically-triggered calcium waves in cardiomyocytes
   coupled to fibroblasts, susceptibility to calcium wave propagation was
   reduced as the current through the gap junction caused current drain
   from the myocytes. In 1D multi-cellular arrays coupled via gap
   junctions, mechanically-induced waves may contribute to synchronizing
   arrhythmogenic calcium waves and after-depolarizations.}},

   Efficacy and Usability in Preschool Wheezers}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PEDIATRICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Introduction and Objectives: Wheezing episodes are the first causes of
   doctor's consultation in preschool age. Treatment is usually
   administered with a metered dose inhaler (MDI) spacer. At variance, many
   parents and doctors prefer to use a compressor nebulizer, which cannot
   be easily carried. The study is aimed at testing whether a pocket mesh
   nebulizer has similar efficacy and acceptability than a standard MDI
   device.
   Materials and Methods: The IPAC study was a randomized, controlled,
   non-inferiority trial (number: 1616/2018, Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino
   Gesu'-IRCCS). The study had two arms: cases, using MicroAIR U100, and
   controls, using MDI+spacer device. Both devices were adopted for
   long-term treatment and for exacerbations. Follow-up was organized with
   clinical visits and a daily e-diary connected to an application for
   mobile phone.
   Results: One hundred patients were enrolled. The frequency of asthmatic
   symptoms showed a non-inferiority for MicroAIR U100 group vs. MDI.
   Accordingly, no significant difference was found in the average \% of
   days with cough, wheezing, breathlessness after exercise, days lost at
   school, and not-programmed visits. Considering only patients with >1 day
   with symptoms, no significant sdifferences were found in the number of
   exacerbations nor in the cumulative days with symptoms. The acceptance
   and usability of both devices have been favorable. However, the
   MDI+AeroChamber (R) device showed better acceptability.
   Conclusions: Our study shows that MicroAIR U-100, a mesh nebulizer, has
   similar clinical efficacy but lower acceptance and usability than an MDI
   plus Aerochamber (R) in delivering therapy in preschool wheezers.
   Therefore, MicroAIR U-100 might be a valuable second choice, when the
   delivery of medication with an MDI plus Aerochamber (R) is not accepted,
   or wrongly used by the parents.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) enables
   dissociation of tumour cells from the primary tumour mass, invasion
   through the extracellular matrix, intravasation into blood vessels and
   colonisation of distant organs. Cells that revert to the epithelial
   state via the mesenchymal-epithelial transition cause metastases, the
   primary cause of death in cancer patients. EMT also empowers cancer
   cells with stem-cell properties and induces resistance to
   chemotherapeutic drugs. Understanding the driving factors of EMT is
   critical for the development of effective therapeutic interventions.
   Methods: This manuscript describes the generation of a database
   containing EMT gene signatures derived from cell lines, patient-derived
   xenografts and patient studies across cancer types and multiomics data
   and the creation of a web-based portal to provide a comprehensive
   analysis resource.
   Results: EMTome incorporates (i) EMT gene signatures; (ii) EMT-related
   genes with multiomics features across different cancer types; (iii)
   interactomes of EMT-related genes (miRNAs, transcription factors, and
   proteins); (iv) immune profiles identified from The Cancer Genome Atlas
   (TCGA) cohorts by exploring transcriptomics, epigenomics, and
   proteomics, and drug sensitivity and (iv) clinical outcomes of cancer
   cohorts linked to EMT gene signatures.
   Conclusion: The web-based EMTome portal is a resource for primary and
   metastatic tumour research publicly available at www.emtome.org.}},

Title = {{Valorization of Food Waste to Produce Eco-Friendly Means of Corrosion
   Protection and ``Green{''} Synthesis of Nanoparticles}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Agrifood by-products are a key element within Europe's sustainable
   strategies. Valorization and reuse of zero-waste technologies are
   becoming more popular, and they are commonly named as
   ``second-generation food waste management.{''} The present study is
   directed to the valuable extracts of ``green{''} organic compounds from
   the by-products of fruit and berry/vegetable crops, which can be
   revalorized in sustainable chemical technology and engineering, namely,
   in the production of ``green{''} synthesis of nanoparticles and for the
   inhibition of corrosion and scaling of metals in corrosive media.
   Numerous types of agrifood by-products (rapeseed pomace, sugar beet
   pulp, fodder radish cake, grape pomace, and pomegranate peels) were
   investigated. The waste extracts for corrosion and scale inhibitors of
   mild steel in tap water were prepared by the conventional extraction
   method that uses 2-propanol and characterized by gas chromatography-mass
   spectroscopy (GC-MS). Inhibition of scaling and corrosion was
   investigated in thermal scaling conditions on the surface of the
   electrode manufactured from mild steel. The LPR technique was applied to
   measure the corrosion rate, and the scaling rate was determined
   gravimetrically. The extracts were found to inhibit the corrosion rate
   2-3 times, while only radish cake extract inhibited both the corrosion
   and scaling rates. The waste extracts to produce nanoparticles were
   prepared by the ultrasound-assisted water extraction with subsequent
   oxidation by oxygen purge and characterized by liquid
   chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS). The aqueous grape pomace and
   pomegranate peel extracts were screened for total phenolic content (TPC)
   and total flavonoid content (TFC). The reduction capacity of the
   extracts was assessed using ferric reducing power (FRAP) and
   phosphomolybdenum (PM) assays. AgNPs were characterized by UV-Vis
   spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and
   energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis. The particle size
   of AgNPs ranged between 40 and 50 nm. The antimicrobial activity of
   AgNPs was tested against Escherichia coli using the agar diffusion
   method and optical density.}},

Title = {{Experimental study on ash deposition characteristics of dryer exhaust
   along horizontal tube bundles using digital imaging techniques}},
Journal = {{DRYING TECHNOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{In this study, wet air with ash particles was used to simulate real
   dryer exhaust from lignite-drying process, and its ash deposition
   characteristics along horizontal tube bundles were experimentally
   studied to provide theoretical guidance for the design and operation of
   waste heat recovery devices. The ash deposition on the longitudinal
   section of the tube bundles was considered, and the ash deposition
   thickness under different experimental conditions was quantitatively
   measured using digital imaging techniques. The spatial and temporal
   distributions of the ash deposition thickness and its variation with
   mainstream inlet temperature, mainstream velocity, water vapor mass
   fraction, and ash particle concentration were presented. The ash
   accumulated on the windward side of the tube bundles and mainly
   concentrated on the first five rows in the inlet section, especially on
   the first two rows. The rapid growth of ash deposition mainly occurred
   in the first 3000 s and then gradually stabilized. The ash deposition
   thickness was insensitive to the mainstream inlet temperature and
   velocity, whereas the water vapor mass fraction and ash particle
   concentration had significant influences on the ash deposition
   thickness. When the water vapor mass fraction increased from 5\% to
   15\%, the average ash deposition thickness decreased from 7.67 mm to
   1.87 mm. As the ash particle concentration increased from 1.0 g center
   dot m(-3) to 14.8 g center dot m(-3), the average ash deposition
   thickness increased from 1.91 mm to 26.0 mm. The change in ash
   deposition thickness was significantly larger than that in heat transfer
   coefficient under different conditions.}},

Title = {{SNS use leads to luxury brand consumption: evidence from China}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONSUMER MARKETING}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{101-112}},
Month = {{JAN 14}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   Social networking sites (SNSs) are an indispensable part of people's
   daily lives. However, scant literature describes how SNSs affect users'
   behaviors, especially consumer behavior in emerging markets. This
   research aims to fill this literature gap.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Two empirical studies were conducted using different methods. Study 1, a
   survey, provided correlational evidence. Study 2, a lab experiment,
   further verified the causal relationship.
   Findings
   From Chinese consumer data, SNS consumption exposure enhances luxury
   brand consumption, mediated by social comparison motivation and
   moderated by legitimacy perceptions of SNSs as information outlets.
   Originality/value
   This research bridges SNSs and luxury brand consumption, two islands
   among different streams of literature. In addition, the paper
   illuminates the psychological mechanism through which SNSs affect luxury
   brand consumption and the boundary condition in which this effect
   diminishes. Practically, this paper is also instructive for SNSs and
   luxury brands.}},

Title = {{Distal transradial artery access for vascular access intervention}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VASCULAR ACCESS}},
Abstract = {{Background:
   Vascular access intervention is a useful treatment method for
   maintaining arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in dialysis patients. The
   outflow vein is commonly used as the access site for vascular access
   intervention. In cases where it is difficult to puncture veins due to
   multiple lesions or poor AVF development, vascular access intervention
   is performed using the radial artery. However, it is difficult to
   perform a vascular access intervention with radial artery access to the
   AVF in the distal forearm. We reported the efficacy and safety of
   vascular access intervention with distal transradial artery access
   (dTRA).
   Case series:
   We have been conducting vascular access intervention with dTRA access
   since January 2019. We evaluated complications and procedure time for 12
   cases of vascular access intervention with dTRA access performed from
   January to December 2019.
   The success rate of the procedure was 100\% and no puncture hemorrhagic
   complication was observed in 12 cases performed at our institution. No
   radial artery occlusion was observed in 12 cases. The average
   fluoroscopy time was 11.5 min and the average contrast volume was 41 ml.
   Conclusion:
   dTRA for vascular access intervention has advantages over conventional
   radial artery access in terms of safety of the procedure and ease of
   hemostasis.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic waves provide a non-destructive and sensitive way to monitor

   variation of ultrasonic waveform (VUW) is developed to characterize the
   variation of the transmitted waves during the hydration process. The
   recorded hydration indices are compared with the compressive strength
   measured by destructive test at different ages. The results show that
   the VUW is closer to the compressive strength than the other two
   traditional hydration indices, ultrasonic velocity and wave packet
   energy. The proposed VUW provides a simple and accurate way to monitor

Abstract = {{Background: Although some national recommendations for the role of
   radiology in a polytrauma service exist, there are no European
   guidelines to date. Additionally, for many interdisciplinary guidelines,
   radiology tends to be under-represented. These factors motivated the
   European Society of Emergency Radiology (ESER) to develop
   radiologically-centred polytrauma guidelines.
   Results: Evidence-based decisions were made on 68 individual aspects of
   polytrauma imaging at two ESER consensus conferences. For severely
   injured patients, whole-body CT (WBCT) has been shown to significantly
   reduce mortality when compared to targeted, selective CT. However, this
   advantage must be balanced against the radiation risk of performing more
   WBCTs, especially in less severely injured patients. For this reason, we
   recommend a second lower dose WBCT protocol as an alternative in certain
   clinical scenarios. The ESER Guideline on Radiological Polytrauma
   Imaging and Service is published in two versions: a full version
   (download from the ESER homepage, ) and a short version also covering
   all recommendations (this article).
   Conclusions: Once a patient has been accurately classified as
   polytrauma, each institution should be able to choose from at least two
   WBCT protocols. One protocol should be optimised regarding time and
   precision, and is already used by most institutions (variant A). The
   second protocol should be dose reduced and used for clinically stable
   and oriented patients who nonetheless require a CT because the history
   suggests possible serious injury (variant B). Reading, interpretation
   and communication of the report should be structured clinically
   following the ABCDE format, i.e. diagnose first what kills first.}},

Journal = {{BMC GERIATRICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Decision-making capacity (DMC) in aging adults has become increasingly
   salient as the number of older adults, life expectancy, and the amount
   of wealth to be transferred from older generations have all increased.
   The accurate and reliable determination of older adults' DMC is a
   particularly important topic given its implication in legal, financial,
   and health decisions. Based upon the four-ability DMC model promulgated
   by Appelbaum and Grisso in the 1980's, a number of MacArthur Competence
   Assessment Tools have been developed and widely utilized. However, these
   tools do not include cognitive testing or other sources of objective
   data and have limited validity in a medico-legal setting, necessitating
   additional options for the evaluation of DMC. This is significant from
   the perspective of the patient because they have a vested interest in
   accurate and objective assessment of their DMC across domains.Given the
   disparities in the assessment of DMC, the authors propose, through this
   debate article, that the evaluation of DMC in the aging adult population
   utilize a combination of traditional interview and domain specific
   instruments and neuropsychological testing. To achieve a consensus on
   the issue, medical experts in a number of fields related to capacity
   evaluation, including psychiatry, neurology, neuropsychology, and
   general medicine were consulted and recruited as authors. Experts in
   Swiss law and ethics were also consulted and provided input.A tendency
   to focus on a single capacity, and in particular, the ability to consent
   to medical treatment, arose in the literature. Similarly, there are many
   instruments purporting to evaluate a single capacity (e.g., consenting
   to medical treatment, managing finances), while other areas important to
   the evaluation of DMC received little attention (e.g., activities of
   daily living, the ability to live independently, to marry, to resist
   undue influence, and to make a will or advanced care directive). Medical
   and legal experts in the multidisciplinary group agreed that there is a
   clear need for more consistency across evaluation of DMC domains and
   that a combined approach of traditional methods and neuropsychological
   testing provides a more thorough evaluation and better serves the
   patient.}},

Abstract = {{Over-expression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)
   is related to aggressive tumors and poor prognosis in breast cancer.
   Trastuzumab (TRA) resistance leads to tumor recurrence and metastasis,
   resulting in poor prognosis in HER2-positive breast cancer. POU Class 4
   Homeobox 1 (POU4F1) is a member of the POU domain family transcription
   factors, and has a key role in regulating cancers. However, its effects
   on TRA-resistant HER2-positive breast cancer are still vague. In the
   present study, we found that POU4F1 expression was dramatically
   increased in clinical breast cancer specimens with TRA resistance.
   Higher POU4F1 was also detected in HER2-positive breast cancer cells
   with TRA resistance than that of the parental ones. Poor prognosis was
   detected in breast cancer patients with high POU4F1 expression. Under
   TRA treatment, POU4F1 knockdown significantly reduced the proliferative
   capacity of HER2-positive breast cancer cells with TRA resistance.
   POU4F1 silence also sensitized resistant HER-positive breast cancer
   cells to TRA treatment in vivo using a xenograft mouse model, along with
   the markedly reduced tumor growth rate and tumor weight. Moreover, we
   found that POU4F1 deletion greatly decreased the activation of
   mitogen-activated or extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase
   kinases 1 and 2 (MEK1 \textbackslash{}/2) and extracellular-regulated
   kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathways in breast cancer cells with TRA
   resistance. Migration and invasion were also effectively hindered by
   POU4F1 knockdown in TRA-resistant HER2-positive breast cancer cells.
   Notably, we found that POU4F1 deletion-improved chemosensitivity of
   HER2-positive breast cancer cells with drug-resistance to TRA treatment
   was closely associated with the blockage of ERK1 \textbackslash{}/2
   signaling. Collectively, our findings reported a critical role of POU4F1
   in regulating TRA resistance, and demonstrated the underlying molecular
   mechanisms in HER2-positive breast cancer. Thus, POU4F1 may be a
   promising prognostic and therapeutic target to develop effective
   treatment for overcoming TRA resistance. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{A bandpass frequency selective surface (FSS) with fourth-order bandpass
   filtering response is proposed based on aperture-coupled patch
   resonators (ACPRs) under the operation of TM010 and TM030 resonant
   modes. An initial bandpass ACPRs FSS with second-order filtering
   response is firstly realised by periodically arranging the back-to-back
   patch resonators with coupling apertures etched on the common ground. In
   order to combine the resonant modes TM010 and TM030 for a higher-order
   filtering response, seven pairs of shorting pins are properly loaded
   based on the cavity model theory for the microstrip patch resonator. The
   loaded shorting pins make the TM010 mode of the ACPRs shift towards the
   higher frequency, while the TM030 mode keeps nearly unchanged. As a
   result, these two resonant modes can be allocated in proximity to each
   other to finally realise a fourth-order bandpass filtering response. To
   validate the design concept, an FSS prototype is designed and
   fabricated. Reasonable agreement between the measured and simulated
   results validates the conceptual design.}},

Abstract = {{Concave grating imaging spectrometers operating at conventional Rowland
   circle mounting have excellent on-axis imaging performances. However,
   such spectrometers have been found to possess poor off-axis imaging
   performances as a result of the existence of large off-axis grating
   aberrations, which are not suitable for spatial and spectral imaging
   under a large off-axis field of view (FOV) and a broad band. Based on
   the aberration correction theory of toroidal varied line-space gratings
   operating at non-Rowland circle mounting, we designed a solar extreme
   ultraviolet (EUV) normal-incidence imaging spectrometer with a large
   off-axis FOV and a broad band. Specifically, this instrument can provide
   excellent imaging with high spatial and spectral resolutions for EUV
   spectroscopic observations of the solar corona and transition region.
   Besides, the instrument has only two reflective surfaces with periodic
   SiC/Al multilayer coating, which minimizes the loss of photon flux in
   the EUV band and improves the transmission efficiency of the instrument
   greatly. Finally, this unprecedented spectrometer, with an aperture of
   100 mm and the operating bands of 40-47 nm, 53-60 nm, and 66-73 nm,
   achieves a spatial resolution and a spectral resolution better than
   0.55{''} and 30X10(-4) nm respectively, providing ultrahigh resolution
   imaging over the off-axis FOV of 18' along the slit.}},

Title = {{Affective ideology and education policy: implications for critical
   policy research and practice}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EDUCATION POLICY}},
Abstract = {{This paper argues that analyzing education policies through the lens of
   affect theory provides possibilities for understanding how particular
   concepts are associated with certain affective ideologies. To illustrate
   this, the paper analyzes the case of a recent publication by the Council
   of Europe titled Reference Framework of Competences for Democratic
   Culture. The analysis shows how various concepts related to `democratic
   competences' are invested with affective meanings, cultural connotations
   and political rhetoric. The paper argues that democratic competences are
   effectively conflated with emotional competences, opening up an analysis
   of democratic education as a form of individual and psychological
   therapy. The conclusion addresses the implications of this argument for
   education policy research and practice. In particular, it highlights the
   importance of paying attention not only to the ways that affect shapes
   the production of policy text, but also how a policy seeks to invoke
   certain affective dispositions at the point of enactment.}},

Title = {{One-dimensional nexus objects, network of Kibble-Lazarides-Shafi string

   He-3}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{The domain wall problem in the axion solution of strong CP violation has
   condensed-matter-based analogy in nafen-distorted superfluid He-3. The
   Kibble-Lazarides-Shafi (KLS) domain wall, which appears during the
   temperature of the early universe cooling down to QCD scale, attaches to
   the string defect that appeared in the first time symmetry breaking
   phase transition. Recent experiments in rotating superfluid He-3
   produced the network of the KLS string walls in a human controllable
   system. In this system, the half quantum vortices (HQVs) appear the
   first time symmetry breaking from a normal phase vacuum to a polar
   phase, while the KLS domain walls appear and attach on the HQVs in the
   phase transition from the polar phase to polar-distorted B-phase. Based
   on the method of relative homotopy group, the KLS string walls have
   turned out to be the descendants of HQVs of the polar phase. Here we
   further show the KLS string walls smoothly connect to spin solitons with
   a length scale around xi(D) when the spin orbital coupling is taken into
   account. This means HQVs are one-dimensional (1D) nexuses, which connect
   the spin solitons and the KLS domain walls. This is because the subgroup
   G = pi 1(S-S(1), (R) over tilde (2)) of relative homotopy group
   describing the spin solitons is isomorphic to the group describing the
   half spin vortices-the textures of the spin degree of freedom of the KLS
   string wall. In the nafen-distorted He-3 system, 1D nexus objects and
   the spin solitons with topological invariant 2/4 have two different
   types of networks, which are named as pseudorandom lattices of
   inseparable and separable spin solitons. These two types of pseudorandom
   lattices correspond to two different representations of G. We discuss
   the condition under which the pseudorandom lattice model works. The
   equilibrium configuration and surface densities of free energies of
   pseudorandom lattices are calculated by numeric minimization. Based on
   the equilibrium spin textures, we calculate their transverse spin
   dynamic response of NMR, the resulted frequency shifts, and root Omega
   scaling of the ratio intensity exactly coincide with the experimental
   measurements. We also discuss the mirror symmetry in the presence of the
   KLS domain wall and its explicit breaking. Our discussions and
   considerations can be applied to the composite defects in other
   condensed matter and cosmological systems.}},

Abstract = {{Heat capacities are fundamental properties of fluids for heat transfer
   applications. Accurate data can be generally obtained by experimental
   methods, which are usually expensive, difficult, and time-consuming. In
   terms of the calculations of heat capacities, many models have been
   proposed in the literature. Equations of state represent one of the most
   promising methods, but their performance has not been systematically
   studied and extensively reviewed. In this work, the calculations and
   performance of various equations of state for heat capacities are
   reviewed, and the different contributions to heat capacities are also
   discussed. The accuracy of the calculated heat capacities, as presented
   in literature, is also compared for some specific compounds, and the
   effects of different parametrization strategies as well as association
   schemes are analyzed. Finally, calculations for both associating and
   nonassociating compounds are performed using two association models,
   Cubic Plus Association and Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid
   Theory equations of state, for a wide range of compounds for which the
   heat capacity results from literature are available.}},

Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{156-171}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Recent evidence suggests that the processing of observed actions may
   reflect an action prediction error, with more pronounced mediofrontal
   negative event-related potentials (ERPs) for unexpected actions. This
   evidence comes from an application of a false-belief task, where
   unexpected correct responses elicited high ERP amplitudes. An
   alternative interpretation is that the ERP component reflects vicarious
   error processing, as objectively correct responses were errors from the
   observed person's perspective. In this study, we aimed to disentangle
   the two possibilities by adding the factor task difficulty, which varied
   expectations without affecting the definition of (vicarious) errors, and
   to explore the role of empathy in action observation. We found that the
   relationship between empathy and event-related potentials (ERPs)
   mirrored the relationship between empathy and behavioral expectancy
   measures. Only in the easy task condition did higher empathy lead to
   stronger expectancy of correct responses in the true-belief and of
   errors in the false-belief condition. A compatible pattern was found for
   an early ERP component (150-200 ms) after the observed response, with a
   larger negativity for error than correct responses in the true-belief
   and the reverse pattern in the false-belief condition, but only in
   highly empathic participants. We conclude that empathy facilitates the
   formation of expectations regarding the actions of others. These
   expectations then modulate the processing of observed actions, as
   indicated by the ERPs in the present study.}},

Title = {{Medical Students' Awareness of Smell Loss as a Predictor for Coronavirus
   Disease 2019}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Anosmia has been reported as an early presentation of
   coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the pathophysiological
   mechanism of olfactory dysfunction is still unclear.
   Aim: The aim of this study to evaluate the knowledge regarding common
   symptoms, anosmia, treatment options, and PPE among medical students in
   three different universities of Saudi Arabia.
   Methods: This cross-sectional survey conducted among medical students in
   Saudi Arabia. Google Forms was used to create the survey. The
   questionnaire included demographic information, knowledge of COVID-19
   symptoms, sources of information, and the level of awareness of specific
   symptoms (loss of smell and taste).
   Results: A total of 494 students completed the questionnaire. The
   majority of the participants were aware of common COVID-19 symptoms like
   fever and cough (79.8 and 67.2\%, respectively), but less than half were
   aware that smell or taste dysfunction might be a symptom of COVID-19
   (44.3 and 30.2\%, respectively). The present study revealed that the
   source of information also plays a critical role in medical students'
   awareness regarding the symptoms of COVID-19. Students using
   international organization's websites, medical databases, or published
   research had better knowledge of anosmia as a COVID-19 symptom compared
   to those who used WhatsApp, Google, or unofficial social media pages. In
   our study, a minority (11.9\%) of the participants relied on unofficial
   social media pages as the main source of their information.
   Conclusion: Saudi medical students understand that smell or taste
   dysfunction can be a potential symptom of COVID-19, but this knowledge
   was not as widespread as the knowledge regarding the most common
   COVID-19 symptoms.}},

Abstract = {{Synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists (SCRAs) elicit many of their
   psychoactive effects via type-1 human cannabinoid (CB1) receptors.
   Enantiomer pairs of eight tert-leucinate or valinate indole- and
   indazole-3-carboxamide SCRAs were synthesized and their CB1 potency and
   efficacy assessed using an in vitro beta-arrestin recruitment assay in a
   HEK239T stable cell system. A chiral high-performance liquid
   chromatography method with photodiode array and/or quadrupole
   time-of-flight-mass spectrometry detection (HPLC-PDA and
   HPLC-PDA-QToF-MS) was applied to 177 SCRA-infused paper samples seized
   in Scottish prisons between 2018 and 2020. In most samples, SCRAs were
   almost enantiopure (S)-enantiomer (>98\% of total chromatographic peak
   area), although in some (n = 18), 2\% to 16\% of the (R)-enantiomer was
   detected. (S)-enantiomers are consistently more potent than
   (R)-enantiomers and often more efficacious. The importance of SCRA-CB1
   receptor interactions in the ``head{''} or ``linked group{''} moiety is
   demonstrated, with the conformation of the ``bulky{''} tert-leucinate
   group greatly affecting potency (by up to a factor of 374),
   significantly greater than the difference observed between valinate SCRA
   enantiomers. (S)-MDMB-4en-PINACA, (S)-4F-MDMB-BINACA, and
   (S)-5F-MDMB-PICA are currently the most prevalent SCRAs in Scottish
   prisons, and all have similar high potency (EC50, 1-5 nM) and efficacy.
   Infused paper samples were compared using estimated intrinsic efficacy
   at the CB1 receptor (EIECB1) to evaluate samples with variable SCRA
   content. Given their similar potency and efficacy, any variation in CB1
   receptor-mediated psychoactive effects are likely to derive from
   variation in dose, mode of use, pharmacokinetic differences, and
   individual factors affecting the user, rather than differences in the
   specific SCRA present.}},

Abstract = {{Bismuth-based (nano)materials have been attracting increasing interest
   due to appealing properties such as high refractive indexes, intrinsic
   opacity, and structural distortions due to the stereochemistry of 6s(2)
   lone pair electrons of Bi3+. However, the control over specific phases
   and strategies able to stabilize uniform bismuth-based (nano)materials
   is still a challenge. In this study, we employed the ability of bismuth
   to lower the melting point of silica to introduce a new synthetic
   approach able to confine the growth of bismuth-oxide-based materials
   into nanostructures. Combining in situ temperature-dependent synchrotron
   radiation X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) with high-resolution
   transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) analyses, we demonstrate the
   evolution of a confined Bi2O3-SiO2 nanosystem from Bi2SiO3 to Bi4Si3O12
   through a melting process. The silica shell acts as both a nanoreactor
   and a silicon source for the stabilization of bismuth silicate
   glass-ceramic nanocrystals keeping the original spherical shape. The
   exciton peak of Bi2SiO s is measured for the first time allowing the
   estimation of its real energy gap. Moreover, based on a detailed
   spectroscopic investigation, we discuss the potential and the
   limitations of Nd3+-activated bismuth silicate systems as ratiometric
   thermometers. The synthetic strategy introduced here could be further
   explored to stabilize other bismuth-oxide-based materials, opening the
   way toward the growth of well-defined glass-ceramic nanoparticles.}},

Abstract = {{The present study is related with the thermodynamic performance
   assessment of renewable hydrogen production through Boron thermochemical
   water splitting cycle. Therefore, all step efficiencies and overall
   cycle efficiency are calculated based on complete reaction.
   Additionally, a parametric study is conducted to determine the effect of
   the reference environment temperature on the overall cycle efficiency.
   In this regard, exergy efficiencies, exergy destruction rates and also
   inlet and outlet exergy rates of the cycle are calculated and presented
   for various reference temperatures. The exergy efficiency of the cycle
   is calculated as 0.4393 based on complete reaction and occurs at 298 K.
   This study has shown that Boron thermochemical water splitting cycle has
   a great potential due to cycle performance. As a result, Boron based
   thermochemical water splitting cycle can help achieve better environment
   and sustainability due to high exergetic efficiency. By the way,
   economic and technical issues of the storage and transportation of the
   hydrogen can find a proper solution if the hydrogen production reaction

Abstract = {{Fifth generation (5G) cellular networks will serve a wide variety of
   heterogeneous use cases, including mobile broadband users, ultra-low
   latency services and massively dense connectivity scenarios. The
   resulting diverse communication requirements will demand networking with
   unprecedented flexibility, not currently provided by the monolithic
   black-box approach of 4G cellular networks. The research community and
   an increasing number of standardization bodies and industry coalitions
   have recognized softwarization, virtualization, and disaggregation of
   networking functionalities as the key enablers of the needed shift to
   flexibility. Particularly, software-defined cellular networks are
   heralded as the prime technology to satisfy the new application-driven
   traffic requirements and to support the highly time-varying topology and
   interference dynamics, because of their openness through well-defined
   interfaces, and programmability, for swift and responsive network
   optimization. Leading the technological innovation in this direction,
   several 5G software-based projects and alliances have embraced the open
   source approach, making new libraries and frameworks available to the
   wireless community. This race to open source softwarization, however,
   has led to a deluge of solutions whose interoperability and interactions
   are often unclear. This article provides the first cohesive and
   exhaustive compendium of recent open source software and frameworks for
   5G cellular networks, with a full stack and end-to-end perspective. We
   detail their capabilities and functionalities focusing on how their
   constituting elements fit the 5G ecosystem, and unravel the interactions
   among the surveyed solutions. Finally, we review hardware and testbeds
   on which these frameworks can run, and provide a critical perspective on
   the limitations of the state-of-the-art, as well as feasible directions
   toward fully open source, programmable 5G networks.}},

Title = {{Perceived benefits of retrofitted residential secondary glazing: an
   exploratory Australian study}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUILDING PATHOLOGY AND ADAPTATION}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Retrofitting single glazing with double glazing saves energy
   and enhances indoor comfort, however replacement can be expensive.
   Secondary glazing is an easier-to-install, cost-effective retrofit
   alternative. There is a gap in the literature about post-retrofit
   occupant satisfaction with secondary glazed windows in Australia.
   Design/methodology/approach - This research addresses this gap, with an
   online survey completed by 56 respondents in New South Wales and the
   Australian Capital Territory who retrofitted secondary glazing. This
   research seeks a deeper understanding of occupier views. Issues of
   validity and internal and external reliability were addressed in the
   research.
   Findings - Strong satisfaction and significant improvement in indoor
   comfort was found. Over 80\% of respondents felt their home had better
   thermal and noise insulation. Nearly 79\% found a positive impact on
   their property value and 77\% would retrofit secondary glazing if they
   moved. Occupants considered secondary glazing a suitable technical,
   economic and environmental alternative to double glazing in retrofits.
   Research limitations/implications - There is a chance of sampling bias;
   only satisfied respondents answer the survey. Survey data was collected
   from occupants located in a small geographic area and who used the same
   manufacturer. Different climatic conditions, varying specifications and
   quality of installed systems could influence perceptions.
   Practical implications - Many reported health and wellbeing
   improvements, higher comfort, higher property value and willingness to
   invest in residential energy efficiency measures. These findings need to
   be more widely known in the Australian market.
   Originality/value -Few studies focus on retrofitting secondary glazing
   to Australian residential buildings. This study highlights the social,
   economic and environmental benefits perceived by occupants
   post-retrofit.}},

Abstract = {{Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury greatly contributes to
   myocardial tissue damage in patients with coronary disease, which
   eventually leads to heart failure. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have an
   emerging role in the process of myocardial I/R injury. Our previous work
   revealed the protective role of miR-374a-5p against myocardial I/R
   injury. In this study, we explored the role of lncRNA TTTY15 and its
   potential interaction mechanisms with miR-374a-5p in myocardial I/R
   injury. The expression of TTTY15 was increased both in vitro and in vivo
   after myocardial I/R injury models according to quantitative real-time
   polymerase chain reaction. Various assays were conducted to evaluate the
   regulatory relationship among TTTY15, miR-374a-5p, FOXO1, and autophagy
   in H9c2 and HL-1 cells. The results showed that TTTY15 suppresses
   autophagy and myocardial I/R injury by targeting miR-374a-5p. We found
   that TTTY15 regulates miR-374a-5p, thus affecting FOXO1 expression and
   autophagy in myocytes during I/R. Furthermore, in an in vivo mouse model
   of myocardial I/R injury, suppression of TTTY15 successfully alleviated
   myocardial I/R injury. Our results reveal a novel feedback mechanism in
   which TTTY15 regulates miRNA processing and a potential target in
   myocardial I/R injury. TTTY15 is a promising therapeutic target for
   treating myocardial I/R injury.}},

   Solar Cells by Sub-Bandgap External Quantum Efficiency Spectroscopy}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Ion dissociation has been identified to determine the intrinsic
   stability of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs), but the underlying
   degradation mechanism is still elusive. Herein, by combining highly
   sensitive sub-bandgap external quantum efficiency (s-EQE) spectroscopy,
   impedance analysis, and theoretical calculations, the evolution of
   defect states in PVSCs during the degradation can be monitored. It is
   found that the degradation of PVSCs can be divided into three steps: 1)
   dissociation of ions from perovskite lattices, 2) migration of
   dissociated ions, and 3) consumption of I- by reacting with metal
   electrode. Importantly, step (3) is found to be crucial as it will
   accelerate the first two steps and lead to continuous degradation. By
   replacing the metal with more chemically robust indium tin oxide (ITO),
   it is found that the dissociated ions under light soaking will only
   saturate at the perovskite/ITO interface. Importantly, the dissociated
   ions will subsequently restore to the corresponding vacancies under dark
   condition to heal the perovskite and photovoltaic performance. Such
   shuttling of mobile ions without consumption in the ITO-contact PVSCs
   results in harvesting-rest-recovery cycles in natural day/night
   operation. It is envisioned that the mechanism of the intrinsic
   perovskite material degradation reported here will lead to clearer
   research directions toward highly stable PVSCs.}},

Abstract = {{While current clinical research generally employs complex computational
   methods to analyze large amounts of data, reproducible research is a
   growing movement within the scientific community. This methodology paper
   consists of five sections discussing the definitions of replicability,
   reproducibility, and reproducible research, the current status of
   reproducible research in nursing science, the introduction of a
   reproducible framework, and the challenges and recommendations for
   reproducible research. To ensure the data preprocessing process and data
   analysis of an original study at the minimum standard, it is necessary
   for the study's data investigative cycle to be transparent. Most
   arguments for reproducible research were driven by a critical review of
   journal articles and conference proceedings. The suggested
   methodological framework capturing how scientific research generates is
   expected to contribute to guiding nurse scientists to conduct
   reproducible research. To generate high-quality scientific evidence for
   evidence-based practice, the reproducible framework should be integrated

Abstract = {{High fidelity two-qubit gates exhibiting low cross talk are essential
   building blocks for gate-based quantum information processing. In
   superconducting circuits, two-qubit gates are typically based either on
   rf-controlled interactions or on the in situ tunability of qubit
   frequencies. Here, we present an alternative approach using a tunable
   cross-Kerr-type ZZ interaction between two qubits, which we realize with
   a flux-tunable coupler element. We control the ZZ-coupling rate over 3
   orders of magnitude to perform a rapid (38 ns), high-contrast, low
   leakage (0.14 +/- 0.24\%) conditional phase CZ gate with a fidelity of
   97.9 +/- 0.7\% as measured in interleaved randomized benchmarking
   without relying on the resonant interaction with a noncomputational
   state. Furthermore, by exploiting the direct nature of the ZZ coupling,
   we easily access the entire conditional phase gate family by adjusting
   only a single control parameter.}},

Title = {{Combined forced oscillation and fractional-order modeling in patients

Abstract = {{Background Fractional-order (FrOr) models have a high potential to
   improve pulmonary science. These models could be useful for
   biomechanical studies and diagnostic purposes, offering accurate models
   with an improved ability to describe nature. This paper evaluates the
   performance of the Forced Oscillation (FO) associated with integer
   (InOr) and FrOr models in the analysis of respiratory alterations in
   work-related asthma (WRA). Methods Sixty-two individuals were evaluated:
   31 healthy and 31 with WRA with mild obstruction. Patients were analyzed
   pre- and post-bronchodilation. The diagnostic accuracy was evaluated
   using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
   To evaluate how well do the studied models correspond to observed data,
   we analyzed the mean square root of the sum (MSEt) and the relative
   distance (R-d) of the estimated model values to the measured resistance
   and reactance measured values. Results and discussion Initially, the use
   of InOr and FrOr models increased our understanding of the WRA
   physiopathology, showing increased peripheral resistance, damping, and
   hysteresivity. The FrOr model (AUC = 0.970) outperformed standard FO
   (AUC = 0.929), as well as InOr modeling (AUC = 0.838) in the diagnosis
   of respiratory changes, achieving high accuracy. FrOr improved the curve
   fitting (MSEt = 0.156 +/- 0.340; R-d = 3.026 +/- 1.072) in comparison
   with the InOr model (MSEt = 0.367 +/- 0.991; R-d = 3.363 +/- 1.098).
   Finally, we demonstrated that bronchodilator use increased dynamic
   compliance, as well as reduced damping and peripheral resistance.
   Conclusions Taken together, these results show clear evidence of the
   utility of FO associated with fractional-order modeling in patients with
   WRA, improving our knowledge of the biomechanical abnormalities and the
   diagnostic accuracy in this disease.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the hydrogeological map of the western Po Plain,
   located in Piedmont (north-western Italy). Po plain represents a
   hydrogeological system of European relevance, and the Piedmont Plain is
   the most important groundwater reservoir of the Region. The 1:300,000
   scale map was realised using previous and new data to update the
   knowledge of this area. The map provides information about the
   hydrogeological complexes and their type and degree of permeability,
   water table levels and depth, piezometric level fluctuation,
   lithostratigraphic cross-sections, thickness, and percentage of the
   permeable deposits between 0 and 50 m from the ground surface. All this
   information is essential to public administrations, stakeholders,
   researchers, and professionals for defining possible tools for
   groundwater protection and management and for planning new groundwater
   exploitation (i.e. municipal drinking water supplies).}},

Title = {{An effective node-removal method against P2P botnets}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{182}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Nowadays, there is no effective solution to take down P2P botnets. In
   this paper, we have proposed a probabilistic node-removal method for P2P
   botnets forming random network, which reduces the resilience of the C\&C
   channel of P2P botnets more effectively compared to other previous
   methods. We have introduced a new approach for selecting the critical
   nodes. In our method, based on collecting the receiving times of
   commands in some bots, the command entry points are identified, and then
   the critical nodes are determined. Our approach can be used for cases in
   which the botmaster inject the commands into the botnet from more than
   one point. If the topology of botnets is unknown, our method can be
   applied to the reconstructed topology. In this paper, a new metric is
   defined for accurately measuring the power of the botnet after removing
   the critical nodes. This metric is compatible with several entry points
   of the commands. We have validated our method through simulations. The
   obtained results indicate that we can effectively isolate significantly
   more nodes from the origin compared to the other node-removal methods.
   In the best results, we have managed to isolate the first node of a
   botnet with 500 peers by removing only 8\% of the bots. In the same
   botnet, 22\% of the bots are isolated by only 75 removals, while the
   best other methods isolate 1\% of the bots by 466 removals. Moreover, in
   two cases of P2P botnet with multiple command entry points, our method
   has isolated around 14 and 22 times more nodes compare to the best
   method among the others.}},

Abstract = {{As part of an archaeological research project, we investigate the
   geomorphology of the cold and arid study area by combining field mapping
   with use of orthoimages and DEM. To the north of a broad trunk valley
   floor, gentle slopes continuously vegetated culminate around 3000 m,
   while to the south steep slopes reaching to 3500 m are deeply incised
   and covered mainly by regolith. The basin has been intensively glaciated
   as evidenced by the till covering the gentler slopes, several morainic
   complexes, kame terraces and roches moutonnees. The present
   morphodynamics of this permafrost-affected basin is mainly periglacial,
   with blockfields, solifluction lobes, patterned ground and rock glaciers
   on gentle slopes to high-elevated flat terrain, and block slopes and
   rockfall talus on steeper slopes. Large alluvial fans at the outlet of
   the steep lateral valleys constrain the anastomosing channel of the
   Kalguty river. Active braided channels in those valleys evidence
   seasonal high peak discharge.}},

Abstract = {{The root assessments and nutrient uptake kinetics parameters, i.e. Vmax,
   Km and Cmin, are useful to characterize the efficiency of nutrients
   uptake, but it is generally studied for a unique nutrient at a time. In
   this study, we aimed to evaluate the root morphology, the kinetic
   parameters and the simultaneous influxes of phosphorus (P), potassium
   (K), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) in seedlings of six eucalyptus
   clones (58, 386, GG100, I042, I144 and VM1). Clone 386 presented a more
   developed root system, contrary to GG100 that had roots development
   quite restricted. The uptake kinetic parameters varied according to the
   genotypes and nutrients. VM1 was the best clone studied due to its high
   plasticity, i.e. it establishes easily under high or low P and K
   availabilities, and showed higher influxes rates of P, K and Ca. On
   contrary, I042 presented the lower influxes rates for P, Ca, and Mg. The
   joint uptake kinetics of P, K, Ca, and Mg allowed the characterization
   of the influx of these nutrients for the eucalyptus clones. Hence we
   suggest this approach in future studies for others crops, since soil
   solution has several nutrients that can interact with each other during
   the process of absorption by the roots.}},

Abstract = {{Crop management determinants that manipulate population, diversity and
   function of soil microbiome are crucial for managing plant health and
   soil quality, nutrients cycling, ecosystem functioning, and plant-soil
   feedback. Herein, the objectives of the present preliminary
   investigation were to assess the impact of plastic film (black and
   silver) and organic (wheat straw) mulching on the different rhizosphere
   microbial population, plant growth, and mineral uptake in tomato crop.
   The measurement of rhizosphere microbial population and plant growth
   attributes was performed at the vegetative and reproductive growth
   stages of the tomato crop, while, mineral uptake analysis was carried
   out at the vegetative stage using the inductively coupled plasma optical
   emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The result of experiments revealed that
   soil mulching favored microbial abundance in the crop rhizosphere,
   improved plant growth parameters and mineral uptake in tomato plants.
   The highest bacterial (6.75 +/- 0.16 log(10) colony-forming units per
   gram of soil (CFUg(-1)), and phosphorous solubilizing organisms (5.47
   +/- 0.02 log(10) CFUg(-1)) population was found in silver mulch while
   wheat straw (as organic mulch) resulted in the higher fungal (4.64 +/-
   0.04 log(10) CFUg(-1)), actinomycetes (5.68 +/- 0.06 log10 CFUg(-1)) and
   rhizobial count (3.77 +/- 0.07 log(10) CFUg(-1)) during the vegetative
   growth. Consistently, the rhizosphere microbial population at the
   fruiting stage was also found higher in either colored plastic film or
   organic mulch treatment. Soil mulching also led to the substantial
   improvement in the plants shoot length, shoot girth and the number of
   secondary branches both at the vegetative and fruiting stage. ICP-OES
   analysis of mulched plant revealed the better mineral uptake in
   different parts of plants. The highest concentration for P (4535.67 +/-
   92.87 mgkg(-1)), K (11933.33 +/- 338.35 mgkg(-1)), Mg (10263.33 +/-
   63.86 mg kg(-1)) and micronutrients uptake values for Fe (1167.67 +/-
   16.14 mg kg(-1)), Mn (133.83 +/- 2.15 mg kg(-1)), and Cu (40.11 +/- 0.87
   mg kg(-1)) were observed in the silver film mulch treatment. Likewise,
   tomatoes from soil mulched conditions also recorded the highest uptake
   of the analyzed mineral nutrients. The present study revealed that soil
   mulching could be an effective technique for favorably altering
   beneficial soil microflora and enhancing mineral uptake in crop plants
   and thus for improving soil quality and productivity in a sustainable
   manner.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundDesign thinking allows challenging problems to be redefined in
   order to identify alternative user-center strategies and solutions. To
   address the many challenges associated with collecting and reporting
   data during the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone,
   we used a design thinking approach to build the Global Ebola Laboratory
   Data collection and reporting system.Main textWe used the five-stage
   Design Thinking model proposed by Hasso-Plattner Institute of Design at
   Stanford in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. This approach offers a
   flexible model which focuses on empathizing, defining, ideating,
   prototyping, and testing. A strong focus of the methodology includes
   end-users' feedback from the beginning to the end of the process. This
   is an iterative methodology that continues to adapt according to the
   needs of the system. The stages do not need to be sequential and can be
   run in parallel, out of order, and repeated as necessary. Design
   thinking was used to develop a data collection and reporting system,
   which contains all laboratory data from the three countries during one
   of the most complicated multi-country outbreaks to date. The data
   collection and reporting system was used to orient the response
   interventions at the district, national, and international levels within
   the three countries including generating situation reports, monitoring
   the epidemiological and operational situations, providing forecasts of
   the epidemic, and supporting Ebola-related research and the Ebola
   National Survivors programs within each country.ConclusionsOur study
   demonstrates the numerous benefits that arise when using a design
   thinking methodology during an outbreak to solve acute challenges within
   the national health information system and the authors recommend it's
   use during future complex outbreaks.}},

Abstract = {{Deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (DsGSD) represents a
   relevant geological-geomorphological feature of the landscape and has
   drawn scientific attention for the past several decades. During a
   detailed fieldwork in the Ligurian Alps, we identified areas (larger
   than ca 5 km2), characterized by very low percentage of outcrops, with
   rock blocks on the watershed and many morpho-tectonic evidences. Through
   the integration of geological-geomorphological mapping, structural data,
   photo interpretation, GIS-based analyses, we identified a number of
   typical DsGSDs. The example here described is one major
   complex-sagging-type DsGSD that is not present in national land planning
   and/or management databases but that is likely at the origin of the
   large-scale landslides which affected the villages of the area. This
   DsGSD is also located within the Beigua UNESCO Global Geopark, in an
   area of unique natural and historical value. This study once again
   highlights the importance of ground truth observations as the basis for
   further investigations.}},

Abstract = {{Background Port Wine Stain (PWS) is a congenital capillary malformation.
   Although multiple treatments are required, the gold standard treatment
   for PWS is Pulsed Dye Laser (PDL). Given its anti-angiogenic effects,
   sirolimus can be considered as an adjuvant to PDL in PWS.
   Aim To evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical sirolimus (Rapamycin)
   0.2\% cream as adjuvant therapy for PDL for PWS.
   Methods In this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 15
   patients with PWS were enrolled. Each lesion was divided into upper and
   lower parts, and each part was assigned randomly to receive PDL (4
   sessions, 2 months apart) plus sirolimus vs PDL and placebo. The
   response was evaluated using colorimetry, investigator global assessment
   (IGA), and patient global assessment (PGA) every two months for eight
   continuous months.
   Results According to the colorimetric analysis, medial and lateral sides
   of the treatment and placebo parts did not differ significantly (both
   P-value > .05). However, according to PGA and IGA, there was a
   significant difference in favor of sirolimus (P-values = .041 and .039,
   respectively). Itching and dryness (86.7\%), contact dermatitis (20\%)
   were the most common adverse effects in the sirolimus group, while none
   of them were observed in placebo.
   Conclusion Although the improvement was significant subjectively,
   topical sirolimus 0.2\% as an adjuvant to PDL does not appear to improve
   PWS erythema using calorimetric assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Premarital education can benefit couples from many socioeconomic levels.
   This study aimed to validate the PREP questionnaire and then explore the
   effectiveness of PREP education for Iranian couples. This study has been
   done in two phases. In the first phase, the PREP questionnaire was
   validated. In the second phase, quasi-experimental research was
   conducted in a pretest-post-test control group design to examine the
   effectiveness of the PREP education for 15 participants in the
   experimental group and 15 participants in the control group. The results
   of factor analysis in the first phase of the study revealed that the
   PREP questionnaire consists of four factors of Friendship and Emotional
   Safety; Communication Danger Signs; Social Integration, and
   Communication Skills. In the second phase of PREP education, there was a
   significant difference between the experimental and control groups in
   the post-test on all four factors. Also, there was a significant
   difference between the experimental and control group on all factors
   except Social Integration. We can conclude that by utilizing PREP, the
   researchers found that interpersonal relationships are highly valued for
   participants and utilizing PREP and other educational programs can
   successfully help Iranian couples navigate through the complexity of
   relational dynamics with more knowledge and skills.}},

Abstract = {{Reproductive decline in mid-adult females is an established phenotype of
   the ageing process. Stress and the rise in glucocorticoids (GCs)
   accelerate reproductive ageing, but little is known about the mechanisms
   involved. During stress, GCs activate the glucocorticoid receptor (GR),
   a ubiquitously expressed, ligand-bound transcription factor, to elicit
   physiological changes for restoring homeostasis. Here, we tested the
   hypothesis that GC-GR signalling is essential for accelerating
   reproductive ageing. To test this, we used a ubiquitous GR knockout
   (GRKO) zebrafish, which is inherently hypercortisolemic, to delineate
   the role of high cortisol and GR signalling on reproductive ageing. The
   loss of GR led to premature ovarian ageing, including high frequency of
   typical and atypical follicular atresia in vitellogenic oocytes, yolk
   liquefaction and large inflammatory infiltrates. The reduction in oocyte
   quality was also associated with a decline in ovarian tert expression in
   the adult GRKO fish compared to the early adult GRKO and adult wild-type
   zebrafish. Accelerated ovarian ageing also impacted the progeny,
   including lower breeding success, fecundity, egg fertilization rate and
   delayed somitogenesis and embryo survival in the adult GRKO fish. We
   adduce that GR signalling is essential for prolonging the reproductive
   lifespan and improving the egg quality and embryo viability in
   zebrafish.}},

Abstract = {{Ground motion selection is arguably the most crucial step in
   performance-based seismic design and risk assessment, as it bears the
   highest level of uncertainty that needs to be propagated through the
   calculations. The presently typical approach to capture this uncertainty
   in predicted structural responses is to use a suite of ground motions
   that match a uniform-hazard response spectrum. This study examines the
   downstream effects of ground motion selection made through a variety of
   conditioning criteria based on one, two, or average of more-than-two
   intensity measures, and also with respect to different earthquake
   characteristics. Ductile and nonductile reinforced concrete moment
   frames with varying heights are used as model problems in detailed
   parametric studies. A risk-based approach is adopted to develop a
   point-of-comparison reference demand. Seismic responses obtained using
   different ground motion suites compiled using three different
   conditioning criteria are then compared against this reference to
   determine the extent to which the selected ground motion suites can
   capture various critical structural responses.}},

Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{4}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background Cystic adrenal lesions are rare and uncommon manifestation
   with few cases reported so far. Different types of adrenal cysts have
   been described with heterogeneous etiology and overlapping clinical
   findings, ranging from benign to malignant cystic neoplasm. They are
   usually asymptomatic or may rarely present with abdominal pain or
   fullness. Optimum management of adrenal cysts still remain
   controversial, owing to its low incidence. In this study, we report our
   institutional experience on diagnosis and management of different
   histological types of cystic adrenal lesions.
   Cases During 4 years period, 55 patients underwent adrenalectomy with
   five cases presenting as adrenal cysts. All the five patients were
   biochemically nonfunctional and underwent adrenalectomy (laparoscopic
   anterior n = 2, retroperitoneoscopic approach n = 1, and open anterior
   transperitoneal approach n = 2). The primary indications for surgery
   were larger size and/or suspicion of malignancy. Histological evaluation
   revealed two epithelial cysts, one endothelial cyst, one pseudocyst, and
   a very rare case of adrenocortical carcinoma arising in a pseudocyst.
   Conclusion Cystic adrenal lesions are rare with varied etiologic and
   clinical presentation that may sometimes lead to diagnostic and
   management dilemma. These cases must undergo biochemical and
   radiological evaluation to rule out underlying malignancy followed by
   referral for surgical intervention.}},

Abstract = {{Intensive understanding of the surface mechanism of cathode materials,
   such as structural evolution and chemical and mechanical stability upon

   batteries (SSLBs) of tomorrow. Here, via in situ atomic force microscopy
   monitoring, we explore the dynamic evolution process at the surface of
   LiNi0.3Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathode particles inside a working SSLB. The dynamic
   formation process of the cathode interphase layer, with an
   inorganic-organic hybrid structure, was real-time imaged, as well as the
   evolution of its mechanical property by in situ scanning of the
   Deijaguin-Muller-Toporov modulus. Moreover, different components of the
   cathode interphase layer, such as LiF, Li2CO3, and specific organic
   species, were identified in detailat different stages of cycling, which
   can be directly correlated with the impedance buildup of the battery. In
   addition, the transition metal migration and the formation of new phases
   can further exacerbate the degradation of the SSLB. A relatively stable
   cathode interphase is key to improving the performance of SSLBs. Our
   findings provide deep insights into the dynamic evolution of surface
   morphology, chemical components and mechanical properties of the cathode
   interphase layer, which are pivotal for the performance optimization of

Abstract = {{Natural photosynthesis relies on a sophisticated charge transfer pathway
   among multiple components with precise spatial, energetic, and temporal
   organizations in the aqueous environment. It continues to inspire and
   challenge the design and fabrication of artificial multicomponent
   colloidal nanostructures for solar-to-fuel conversion. Herein, we
   introduce a plasmonic photocatalyst synthesized with colloidal methods
   with five integrated components including cocatalysts installed in
   orthogonal locations. The precise deposition of individual inorganic
   components on an Au/TiO2 nanodumbell nanostructure is enabled by
   photoreduction and photooxidation, which selectively occurs at the TiO2
   tip sites and Au lateral sites, respectively. Under visible-light
   irradiation, the photocatalyst exhibited activity of oxygen evolution
   from water without scavengers. We demonstrate that each component is
   essential for improving the photocatalytic performance. In addition,
   mechanistic studies suggest that the photocatalytic reaction requires
   combining the hot charge carriers derived from exciting both the d-sp
   interband transition and the localized surface plasmon resonance of Au.}},

Abstract = {{Although cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) improve cardiac function and
   outcomes in patients with single ventricle physiology, little is known
   about their safety and therapeutic benefit in children with dilated
   cardiomyopathy (DCM). We aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of
   CDCs in a porcine model of DCM and translate the preclinical results
   into this patient population. A swine model of DCM using intracoronary
   injection of microspheres created cardiac dysfunction. Forty pigs were
   randomized as preclinical validation of the delivery method and CDC
   doses, and CDC-secreted exosome (CDCex)-mediated cardiac repair was
   analyzed. A phase 1 safety cohort enrolled five pediatric patients with
   DCM and reduced ejection fraction to receive CDC infusion. The primary
   endpoint was to assess safety, and the secondary outcome measure was
   change in cardiac function. Improved cardiac function and reduced
   myocardial fibrosis were noted in animals treated with CDCs compared
   with placebo. These functional benefits were mediated via CDCex that
   were highly enriched with proangiogenic and cardioprotective microRNAs
   (miRNAs), whereas isolated CDCex did not recapitulate these reparative
   effects. One-year follow-up of safety lead-in stage was completed with
   favorable profile and preliminary efficacy outcomes. Increased
   CDCex-derived miR-146a-5p expression was associated with the reduction
   in myocardial fibrosis via suppression of proinflammatory cytokines and
   transcripts. Collectively, intracoronary CDC administration is safe and
   improves cardiac function through CDCex in a porcine model of DCM. The
   safety lead-in results in patients provide a translational framework for
   further studies of randomized trials and CDCex-derived miRNAs as
   potential paracrine mediators underlying this therapeutic strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Surgical resection is the first-line therapy for colorectal cancer
   (CRC). However, for advanced CRC, the curative effect of surgical
   resection is limited due to either local recurrence or distal
   metastasis. Postoperative in situ immunotherapy, presents a promising
   option for preventing tumor recurrence and metastasis, owing to the fact
   that surgeons have unique opportunities and direct access to the
   surgical site. Herein, a designed biopolymer immune implant for CRC
   post-surgical therapy, characterized with tissue adhesion, sustained
   drug release, and sequential elicitation of innate immunity, adaptive
   immunity, and immune memory effects, is reported. With gradual release
   of the loaded resiquimod (R848) and anti-OX40 antibody (aOX40), the
   immune implant can eradicate residual tumors post-surgery (with no tumor
   recurrence in 150 days), inhibit the growth of distal tumors and elicit
   immune memory effects to resist tumor re-challenge. Immunological
   analysis reveal that the biopolymer immune plant treatment leads to a
   two-stage action, with enhanced natural killer cells (NK cells)
   infiltration and activation of dendritic cells (DCs) in the first
   several days, then a greatly increased population of infiltrating T
   cells, and finally immune memory effects are established. The reported
   biopolymer immune implants provide a valuable and clinically-relevant
   option for post-surgical CRC management.}},

Title = {{Impact of the Timing of Rocuronium Injection after Propofol
   Administration on Temporal Summation of Pain in Gynecologic Laparoscopic
   Surgery: A Prospective and Controlled Study}},
Journal = {{PAIN RESEARCH \& MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Purpose. Temporal summation of pain, which is defined as the perception
   of greater pain evoked by repetitive painful stimuli, varies among
   individuals. This study aimed at determining the impact of the timing of
   rocuronium after induction with propofol on the temporal summation of
   pain. Methods. One hundred patients aged 19-60 years underwent
   gynecologic laparoscopic surgery. Patients were randomly assigned to one
   of the two groups: group PRi received immediate injections of rocuronium
   after propofol administration and group PRd received rocuronium
   injections when the bispectral index score (BIS) decreased to <60 after
   propofol administration. The grade of rocuronium-induced withdrawal
   movement (RIWM) according to the timing of propofol injection, the
   incidence and severity of propofol injection pain (PIP), rescue
   analgesics, visual analog scale (VAS) score after surgery for
   postoperative pain, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) opioid
   consumption, association between PIP and the grade of RIWM, and
   associations between PIP, the grade of RIWM, and postoperative pain
   outcomes were measured. Results. The differences between the incidence
   and severity of PIP in the two groups were not significant. The grade of
   the RIWM in the PRd group was significantly reduced compared with the
   PRi group. Rescue analgesics, severity for postoperative pain, and PCA
   opioid consumption were not significant. Correlations between the
   incidence and severity of PIP and the grade of RIWM were weakly
   negative. Correlations between the grade of RIWM and pain outcomes were
   moderately positive, but correlations between the severity for PIP and
   the postoperative pain outcomes were negligible. Conclusion. The timing
   of rocuronium administration after propofol injection played a role in
   reducing RIWM. The grade of RIWM was significantly related to pain
   outcomes compared with the severity of PIP. Therefore, delayed
   rocuronium injection after induction with propofol reduced temporal
   summation of pain.}},

Title = {{Experimental lung injury induces cerebral cytokine mRNA production in
   pigs}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Background. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an important
   disease with a high incidence among patients admitted to intensive care
   units. Over the last decades, the survival of critically ill patients
   has improved; however, cognitive deficits are among the long-term
   sequelae. We hypothesize that acute lung injury leads to upregulation of
   cerebral cytokine synthesis.
   Methods. After approval of the institutional and animal care committee,
   20 male pigs were randomized to one of three groups: (1) Lung injury by
   oleic acid injection (OAI), (2) ventilation only (CTR) or (3) untreated.
   We compared neuronal numbers, proportion of neurons with markers for
   apoptosis, activation state of Iba-1 stained microglia cells and
   cerebral mRNA levels of different cytokines between the groups 18 hours
   after onset of lung injury.
   Results. Wefound an increase in hippocampal TNFalpha (p< 0 :05) and IL-6
   (p< 0 :05) messenger RNA (mRNA) in the OAI compared to untreated group
   as well as higher hippocampal IL-6 mRNA compared to control (p< 0:05).
   IL-8 and IL-1beta mRNA showed no differences between the groups. We
   found histologic markers for beginning apoptosis in OAI compared to
   untreated (p< 0 :05) and more active microglia cells in OAI and CTR
   compared to untreated (p< 0 :001 each).
   Conclusion. Hippocampal cytokine transcription increases within 18 hours
   after the induction of acute lung injury with histological evidence of
   neuronal damage. It remains to be elucidated if increased cytokine mRNA
   synthesis plays a role in the cognitive decline observed in survivors of
   ARDS.}},

Title = {{Deep-sea water displacement from a turbidity current induced by the
   Super Typhoon Hagibis}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Turbidity currents are the main drivers behind the transportation of
   terrestrial sediments to the deep sea, and turbidite deposits from such
   currents have been widely used in geological studies. Nevertheless, the
   contribution of turbidity currents to vertical displacement of seawater
   has rarely been discussed. This is partly because until recently,
   deep-sea turbidity currents have rarely been observed due to their
   unpredictable nature, being usually triggered by meteorological or
   geological events such as typhoons and earthquakes. Here, we report a
   direct observation of a deep-sea turbidity current using the recently
   developed Edokko Mark 1 monitoring system deployed in 2019 at a depth of
   1,370 m in Suruga Bay, central Japan. A turbidity current occurred two
   days after its probable cause, the Super Typhoon Hagibis (2019), passed
   through Suruga Bay causing devastating damage. Over aperiod of 40 hours,
   we observed increased turbidity with turbulent conditions confirmed by a
   video camera. The turbidity exhibited two sharp peaks around 3:00 and
   11:00 on October 14 (Japan Standard Time). The temperature and salinity
   characteristics during these high turbidity events agreed with
   independent measurements for shallow water layers in Suruga Bay at the
   same time, strongly suggesting that the turbidity current caused
   vertical displacement in the bay's water column by transporting warmer
   and shallower waters downslope of the canyon. Our results add to the
   previous few examples that show meteorological and geological events may
   have significant contributions in the transportation of shallower
   seawater to the deep sea. Recent technological developments pertaining
   to the Edokko Mark 1 and similar devices enable straightforward,
   long-term monitoring of the deep-seafloor and will contribute to the
   understanding of similar spontaneous events in the deep ocean.}},

Abstract = {{Copeptin is a hypothalamic stress hormone that is synthesized in the
   hypothalamus together with Arginine-vasopressin and circulated from the
   neurohypophysis in equimolar amounts and can indicate the individual
   stress level. The aim of this study was to investigate the plasma
   copeptin level for childhood migraine headache. In this study, total
   oxidant status (TOS); total antioxidant status (TAS); oxidative stress
   index (OSI); and copeptin were measured in the plasma samples of 61
   migraine patients and 60 matched healthy participants. The median plasma
   copeptin levels in the patients group and control group were 298.25 and
   194.35 pg/mL, respectively. Copeptin levels were significantly higher in
   migraine patients than in the healthy control group. The specificity and
   sensitivity of copeptin for 249.5 pg/dL cut off value predicting
   diagnosis of migraine were 67\% and 64\%, respectively. In addition, TOS
   and OSI levels were found to be higher and TAS levels were significantly
   lower in patients with migraine than healthy controls. Plasma copeptin
   levels are thought to increase in cases of childhood migraine secondary
   to increased oxidative stress. In the diagnosis of childhood migraine
   cases, it can be used together with oxidative stress biomarkers such as
   TAS, TOS and OSI as a complementary parameter.}},

Title = {{Unsteady axisymmetric flow and heat transfer of a hybrid nanofluid over
   a permeable stretching/shrinking disc}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NUMERICAL METHODS FOR HEAT \& FLUID FLOW}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{31}},

Month = {{MAY 24}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   This study aims to analyze the unsteady flow of hybrid Cu-Al2O3/water
   nanofluid over a permeable stretching/shrinking disc. The analysis of
   flow stability is also purposed because of the non-uniqueness of
   solutions.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The reduced differential equations (similarity) are solved numerically
   using the aid of bvp4c solver (Matlab). Two types of thermophysical
   correlations for hybrid nanofluid (Type 1 and 2) are adopted for the
   comparison results. Using correlation Type 1, the heat transfer and flow
   analysis including the profiles (velocity and temperature) are presented
   in the figures and tables with different values control parameters.
   Three sets of hybrid nanofluid are analyzed: Set 1 (1\% Al2O3 + 1\% Cu),
   Set 2 (0.5\% Al2O3 + 1\% Cu) and Set 3 (1\% Al2O3 + 0.5\% Cu).
   Findings
   The comparison of numerical values between present (Types 1 and 2
   correlations) and previous (Type 2 correlations) results are in a good
   compliance with approximate percent relative error. The appearance of
   two solutions is noticed when the suction parameter is considered and
   the unsteady parameter is less than 0 (decelerating flow) for both
   stretching and shrinking disc while only one solution is possible for
   steady flow. The hybrid nanofluid in Set 1 can delay the separation of
   boundary layer but the hybrid nanofluid in Set 3 has the greatest heat
   transfer rate. Moreover, the inclusion of wall mass suction for
   stretching case can generate a significant increment of heat transfer
   rate approximately 90\% for all fluids (water, single and hybrid
   nanofluids).
   Originality/value
   The present findings are novel and can be a reference point to other
   researchers to further analyze the heat transfer performance and
   stability of the working fluids.}},

Abstract = {{The interactions between aeolian dust and anthropogenic air pollution,
   notably chemical ageing of mineral dust and coagulation of dust and
   pollution particles, modify the atmospheric aerosol composition and
   burden. Since the aerosol particles can act as cloud condensation
   nuclei, this affects the radiative transfer not only directly via
   aerosol-radiation interactions, but also indirectly through cloud
   adjustments. We study both radiative effects using the global
   ECHAM/MESSy atmospheric chemistry-climate model (EMAC) which combines
   the Modular Earth Submodel System (MESSy) with the European
   Centre/Hamburg (ECHAM) climate model. Our simulations show that dust-
   pollution-cloud interactions reduce the condensed water path and hence
   the reflection of solar radiation. The associated climate warming
   outweighs the cooling that the dust-pollution interactions exert through
   the direct radiative effect. In total, this results in a net warming by
   dust-pollution interactions which moderates the negative global
   anthropogenic aerosol forcing at the top of the atmosphere by (0.2 +/-
   0.1) W m(-2).}},

Title = {{Video kills the sentiment-Exploring fans' reception of the video
   assistant referee in the English premier league using Twitter data}},

Abstract = {{Evaluative research of technological officiating aids in sports
   predominantly focuses on the respective technology and the impact on
   decision accuracy, whereas the impact on stakeholders is neglected.
   Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the immediate impact
   of the recently introduced Video Assistant Referee, often referred to as
   VAR, on the sentiment of fans of the English Premier League. We analyzed
   the content of 643,251 tweets from 129 games, including 94 VAR
   incidents, using a new variation of a gradient boosting approach to
   train two tree-based classifiers for text corpora: one classifier to
   identify tweets related to the VAR and another one to rate a tweet's
   sentiment. The results of 10-fold cross-validations showed that our
   approach, for which we only took a small share of all features to grow
   each tree, performed better than common approaches (naive Bayes, support
   vector machines, random forest and traditional gradient tree boosting)
   used by other studies for both classification problems. Regarding the
   impact of the VAR on fans, we found that the average sentiment of tweets
   related to this technological officiating aid was significantly lower
   compared to other tweets (-0.64 vs. 0.08; t = 45.5, p < .001). Further,
   by tracking the mean sentiment of all tweets chronologically for each
   game, we could display that there is a significant drop of sentiment for
   tweets posted in the periods after an incident compared to the periods
   before. A plunge that persisted for 20 minutes on average. Summed up,
   our results provide evidence that the VAR effects predominantly
   expressions of negative sentiment on Twitter. This is in line with the
   results found in previous, questionnaire-based, studies for other
   technological officiating aids and also consistent with the
   psychological principle of loss aversion.}},

Title = {{Success factors for introducing industrial human-robot interaction in

Volume = {{112}},
Number = {{3-4}},

Abstract = {{Human-robot interaction (HRI) promises to be a means whereby
   manufacturing companies will be able to address current challenges like
   a higher demand for customization. However, despite comparably low
   costs, there are only few applications in practice. To date, it remains
   unclear which factors facilitate or hinder the successful introduction
   of industrial collaborative robots (cobots). In a three-step approach,
   we first developed a comprehensive two-dimensional framework covering
   three separate phases and four essential components for human-robot
   working systems. Secondly, we reviewed related literature to identify
   relevant success factors. Thirdly, in an online survey we asked leading
   representatives of German manufacturing companies (n = 81) to assess the
   importance of these factors from a practical point of view. The results
   reveal that besides technology-related factors like occupational safety
   and appropriate cobot configuration, employee-centered factors like the
   fear of job loss and ensuring an appropriate level of trust in the robot
   are considered important. However, company representatives seem to
   underestimate the impact of subtle measures to increase employee
   acceptance which could be incorporated into internal communication
   strategies prior to and during the introduction of cobots. Comparative
   analysis based on three distinct application scenarios suggests that
   most success factors' practical importance is independent of the
   motivation for implementing HRI. Furthermore, answers from practitioners
   in free-text fields reveal that success factors which intuitively come
   to their mind such as financial factors are not necessarily perceived
   most important. Finally, we argue for more application-oriented research
   that focuses on practically relevant factors to guide HRI research,
   inform cobot development, and support companies in overcoming apparent
   barriers.}},

   resolution of 3.4 and 6.8 cm/px of orthomosaics and DSMs is reached on
   average, and the RMS reprojection error is 0.22 m on average. We report
   the morphometric parameters of surveyed islands and discuss issues
   related to accuracy and the usage of UAVs in polar conditions. This
   study demonstrates that small and low cost UAVs can be successfully used
   in harsh polar conditions to obtain accurate orthomosaics and DSMs of

Abstract = {{This study presents the first detailed glacial geomorphological map of

   glaciers of the former Patagonian Ice Sheet. These glaciers occupied the
   Rio Corcovado, Rio Huemul and Lago Palena/General Vintter valleys,
   Chubut province, Argentina (43 degrees S, 71 degrees W). By combining
   remote sensing and field-mapping, we build on previous ice-sheet scale
   mapping and geological surveys to provide high-resolution spatial
   information on local ice-contact glaciogenic, glaciofluvial,
   glaciolacustrine, and subglacial landforms. Twenty-five landform types,
   many of which are newly mapped in the region, were digitized as
   georeferenced shapefiles over a 5300 km(2)area. This map enables the
   identification of former ice-flow directions, relative ice-margin
   positions and glaciofluvial drainage pathways for each preserved
   Quaternary glaciation. It also elucidates the former areal extent,
   geolocation and spillways of glaciolacustrine bodies formed during the
   last deglaciation. The map delivers an essential framework on which to
   build robust glacier-scale geomorphological and geochronological
   reconstructions.}},

Abstract = {{PurposeTo evaluate the operation and early clinical effect in primary
   total knee arthroplasty (TKA) about the novel combination of CT-based
   patient-specific three-dimensional (3D) preoperative design and
   conventional osteotomy instruments, compared with the conventional
   method.MethodsAfter a 1:1 propensity score-matching (PSM), patients were
   matched to the novel technique group and the conventional group, 109
   cases in each group. The conventional group adopted a preoperative
   design based on a full-length radiograph (FLX) and received TKA with
   conventional osteotomy instruments. The novel technique group used a
   CT-based patient-specific 3D preoperative design combined with
   conventional osteotomy instruments; during the surgery, the femoral
   entry point, femoral valgus osteotomy angle, the fix point of tibial
   plateau extramedullary guide pin, and the position of tibial
   extramedullary positioning rod were accurately selected according to the
   preoperative 3D design to ensure accurate intraoperative implementation.
   The lower limb alignment, component position, operation time, tourniquet
   time, hospital stay, blood loss volume, incidence of postoperative
   complications, visual analog scale (Vas) score, and New Knee Society
   Score System (NEW-KSS) at 1day before operation and 1, 6, and 12months
   after operation were recorded and compared.ResultsThe novel technique
   group was significantly better than the conventional group in
   controlling lateral tibial component angle (LTC) (P < 0.001), and the
   novel technique group had lower percentages of hip-knee-ankle angle
   (HKA) outliers (P < 0.001) and overcorrection (P = 0.003). The operation
   time, tourniquet time, and hospital stay of the novel technique group
   was shorter (P < 0.05). In 1month after the operation, the novel
   technique group achieved a significantly better VAS score (P < 0.05),
   but a similar NEW-KSS score (P > 0.05) when compared with the
   conventional group. But in 6 and 12months after surgery, no statistical
   differences were seen in the above two scores (P > 0.05).ConclusionThe
   novel technique of CT-based patient-specific 3D preoperative design
   combined with conventional instruments can improve the accuracy of
   osteotomy in primary total knee arthroplasty, with benefits of
   significantly reducing pain and rapid recovery during the early
   postoperative period, but having no obvious effect on outcome after a
   1-year follow-up.}},

Abstract = {{Iron, N-codoped carbon materials (Fe-N-C) are promising electrocatalysts
   toward oxygen reduction reactions due to their high atom utilization
   efficiency and intrinsic activity. Nanostructuring of the Fe-N-C
   materials, such as introducing porosity into the carbon structure, would
   be conducive to further increasing the exposure of active sites as well
   as improving the mass transfer. Herein, we explore the potential of iron
   complexfunctionalized micelles of mesoporous SiO2 as a platform for
   constructing porous Fe-N-C materials. The classical three-dimensional
   MCM-48 was selected as a proof-of-concept example, which was utilized as
   the hard template, and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide micelles inside it
   played the role of the main carbon source. Fe-N-x sites were derived
   from Fe-1,10-phenanthroline complexes in the micelles introduced by in
   situ incorporation of 1,10-phenanthroline and post Fe2+ insertion in an
   aqueous solution. After thermal annealing in a nitrogen atmosphere and
   subsequent removal of the MCM-48 framework, a carbon material that
   possesses porous structural features with uniformly dispersed Fe-N-x
   sites (MPC@PhFe) was obtained, which shows superior ORR activity in a
   0.1 M KOH solution and great potential for Zn-air battery applications
   as well. This work demonstrates the feasibility as well as the
   effectiveness of turning micelles of mesoporous SiO2 into porous carbon
   structures and might offer a universal strategy for manufacturing carbon
   materials for future application in energy storage and conversion.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundThe transplantation of human umbilical cord blood (UCB) CD34+
   cells has been successfully used to treat hematological disorders but
   one major limitation has been the low cell numbers available.
   Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) lying within the bone marrow in vivo
   behave like a scaffold on which CD34+ cells interact and proliferate. We
   therefore evaluated the use of allogeneic MSCs from the human UC
   Wharton's jelly (hWJSCs) as stromal support for the ex vivo expansion of
   CD34+ cells.MethodsWe performed an in-depth evaluation of the
   primitiveness, migration, adhesion, maturation, mitochondrial behavior,
   and pathway mechanisms of this platform using conventional assays
   followed by the evaluation of engraftment potential of the expanded
   CD34+ cells in an in vivo murine model.ResultsWe demonstrate that hWJSCs
   and its conditioned medium (hWJSC-CM) support the production of
   significantly high fold changes of CD34+, CD34+CD133+, CD34+CD90+,
   CD34+ALDH+, CD34+CD45+, and CD34+CD49f+ cells after 7days of interaction
   when compared to controls. In the presence of hWJSCs or hWJSC-CM, the
   CD34+ cells produced significantly more primitive CFU-GEMM colonies,
   HoxB4, and HoxA9 gene expression and lower percentages of CD34+CXCR4+
   cells. There were also significantly higher N-cadherin+ cell numbers and
   increased cell migration in transwell migration assays. The CD34+ cells
   expanded with hWJSCs had significantly lower mitochondrial mass,
   mitochondrial membrane potential, and oxidative stress. Green
   Mitotracker-tagged mitochondria from CD34+ cells were observed lying
   within red CellTracker-tagged hWJSCs under confocal microscopy
   indicating mitochondrial transfer via tunneling nanotubes. CD34+ cells
   expanded with hWJSCs and hWJSC-CM showed significantly reduced oxidative
   phosphorylation (ATP6VIH and NDUFA10) and increased glycolytic (HIF-1a
   and HK-1) pathway-related gene expression. CD34+ cells expanded with
   hWJSCs for 7days showed significant greater CD45+ cell chimerism in the
   bone marrow of primary and secondary irradiated mice when transplanted
   intravenously.ConclusionsIn this report, we confirmed that allogeneic
   hWJSCs provide an attractive platform for the ex vivo expansion of high
   fold numbers of UCB CD34+ cells while keeping them primitive. Allogeneic
   hWJSCs are readily available in abundance from discarded UCs, can be
   easily frozen in cord blood banks, thawed, and then used as a platform
   for UCB-HSC expansion if numbers are inadequate.}},

Journal = {{BMC NEPHROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundHeart rhythm complexity, a measure of heart rate dynamics and
   a risk predictor in various clinical diseases, has not been
   systematically studied in patients with end-stage renal disease. The aim
   of this study is to investigate the heart rhythm complexity and its
   prognostic value for mortality in end-stage renal disease patients
   undergoing hemodialysis.MethodsTo assess heart rhythm complexity and
   conventional heart rate variability measures, 4-h continuous
   electrocardiography for a retrospective cohort of 202 ostensibly healthy
   control subjects and 51 hemodialysis patients with end-stage renal
   disease were analyzed. Heart rhythm complexity was quantified by the
   complexity index from the measurement of the multiscale entropy
   profile.ResultsDuring a follow-up of 13months, 8 people died in the
   patient group. Values of either traditional heart rate variability
   measurements or complexity indices were found significantly lower in
   patients than those in healthy controls. In addition, the complexity
   indices (Area 1-5, Area 6-15 and Area 6-20) in the mortality group were
   significantly lower than those in the survival group, while there were
   no significant differences in traditional heart rate variability
   parameters between the two groups. In receiver operating characteristic
   curve analysis, Area 6-20 (AUC=0.895, p<0.001) showed the strongest
   predictive power between mortality and survival groups.ConclusionThe
   results suggest that heart rhythm complexity is impaired for patients
   with end-stage renal disease. Furthermore, the complexity index of heart
   rate variability quantified by multiscale entropy may be a powerful
   independent predictor of mortality in end-stage renal disease patients
   undergoing hemodialysis.}},

Abstract = {{The persistent reduction reactions between the hyperactive lithium metal
   (Li) and dissolved polysulfides would passivate the Li metal and rapidly
   decrease the cathodic active materials, thus leading to low Coulombic
   efficiency and a short cycle life of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries.
   Herein, we construct artificial lithium isopropyl-sulfide macromolecules
   as an ion-selective interface on the Li metal (IS-Li) by a facile
   electrochemical polymerization method, in which the polymer network
   improves the elasticity and toughness to accommodate the volume change
   of the Li anode and the formed lithium-organosulfides provide great
   mechanical strength to resist the destruction of Li dendrites.
   Importantly, this interfacial layer is proved to be sufficient in
   damping polysulfide anion diffusion and stopping irreversible reduction
   between polysulfides and metallic Li, which greatly contribute to the
   performance improvement of Li-S batteries. The resulting Li-S batteries
   exhibit long-term stability with high capacity retention and Coulombic
   efficiency. This effective strategy sets a new approach for regulating
   the interfacial chemistry of Li metal anodes, which is significant for
   highly stable Li-S batteries.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose This conceptual paper explores gaps in bank privacy protection
   practices and advocates for banks to integrate market-oriented (MO)
   approaches in their corporate digital responsibility (CDR) initiatives
   to minimize consumer data vulnerability. Design/methodology/approach To
   apply MO in CDR, this study recommends adoption of a behavior change
   framework comprising of the co-creation, build and engage (CBE) model
   and proposes the creation of consumer segments based on generational
   cohort and tailoring strategies through motivation, opportunity and
   ability (MOA) model to manage vulnerability. Findings The study
   specifies that managing consumer data vulnerability requires a unique
   strategy different from conventional service delivery. A holistic
   approach is recommended by integrating corporate digital responsibility
   as a pivotal element of organizational strategy and by positioning
   vulnerable customers as a critical stakeholder. Originality/value The
   paper contributes to the research in corporate social responsibility
   (CSR), privacy and data vulnerability in the banking sector in two
   prominent ways: first, the study demonstrates the importance of MO as a
   premise to develop a novel version of CDR called market-oriented digital
   responsibility (MODR). The study considers MODR as a strategy to
   reposition vulnerable consumers as a key stakeholder, and, second, the
   study proposes an innovative set of consumer segments based on data
   vulnerability and introduces a data vulnerability growth model (DVGM)
   connecting vulnerability with age.}},

Abstract = {{Quantum mechanical studies of the Z/E (syn/anti) acetoin oxime
   interconversion have been conducted using both density functional theory
   (DFT) and ab initio post-Hartree-Fock methods in order to understand the
   thermodynamic properties of the syn/anti isomerisation of the aliphatic
   alpha-hydroxyoxime 5,8-diethyl-7-hydroxydodecan-6-oxime. The anti isomer
   of this molecule is the active component in LIX63, a commercial reagent
   used in hydrometallurgical solvent extraction (SX). The effect of
   different sized alkyl (R) groups on both kinetic and thermodynamic
   properties of the equilibrium between syn and anti isomers of aliphatic
   alpha-hydroxyoxime has been studied. Theoretically, it has been shown
   that using R = C3H8 on both ends of the oxime is the minimum substituent
   size required to obtain good agreement for the thermodynamics in
   comparison to experimental data for LIX63. Further increases in the size
   of the R group do not have any significant effect on the final
   distribution between syn and anti isomers of LIX63 hydroxyoxime.
   Inversion was determined to be the most energetically favourable
   hydroxyoxime isomerisation mechanism, with the energy barrier lowered
   when isomerisation is considered between syn and anti isomers with

Title = {{Testing Reliability of Biophilic Design Matrix Within Urban Residential
   Playrooms}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Playtime in urban cities has become an indoor activity for children due
   to limited access to natural outdoor environments. This product of
   urbanization makes the case for the introduction of biophilic design.
   However, playrooms are often neglected as a possibility in designing a
   natural space indoors. Interior designers and other specialists lack a
   reliable tool to identify and incorporate biophilic features into the
   design of these indoor environments in urban settings. The Biophilic
   Interior Design Matrix (BID-M) developed by McGee and Marshall-Baker
   quantifies 52 of Kellert's biophilic design attributes to assess their
   presence and absence within interior spaces. We expanded its use by
   testing the matrix in a new type of space, urban playrooms, and coded
   images of 45 children's playrooms within Manhattan residential buildings
   in New York City, including assessing a larger sample and reliability
   rate compared to McGee and Marshall-Baker's research. Inter-rater
   reliability of the overall design matrix and individual matrix items was
   measured with percent agreement and free-marginal multirater kappa.
   Reliability testing showed overall good reliability of the overall
   design matrix. Several matrix items had low reliability between raters.
   Our findings show that the BID-M needs to be modified to better assess
   urban interior spaces for children.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the role of channelization works on water
   temperatures in the Vermilion River network located in coastal
   Louisiana, USA. A physically based one-dimensional (1D) approach is
   taken for hydrodynamics and heat exchange in the Vermilion River as an
   initial step toward understanding the cumulative effects of flood
   control on riverine water quality and aquatic population dynamics. The
   model performs acceptably well against available measurements for stage
   (root mean square deviation {[}RMSD] = 0.27 m, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency
   {[}NSE] = 0.69-mean) and water temperature (RMSD = 1.6 degrees C, NSE =
   0.91-mean) for the purposes of scenario evaluation. Alternative forcing
   scenarios are developed to assess thermal impact sensitivities to
   dredge-type channelization under various atmospheric and headwater
   boundary conditions. The results suggest that river dredging enhances
   daily temperature fluctuations in the adjacent swamp while reducing
   thermal variation in the river. Temperature variation and cumulative
   effects are also analyzed during critical biological periods at daily
   time scales as increased temperature fluctuation may increase thermal
   stress, while net cooling (cumulative temperature reduction) may affect
   reproduction and growth rates of riverine fish populations. The findings
   are relevant in the management, protection, and restoration of coastal
   riverine ecosystems and future modeling of the cumulative ecological
   effect of river channelization measures.}},

Abstract = {{The mole concept is one of the fundamental concepts in chemistry.
   However, a number of studies carried out in various countries have shown
   that teachers and learners face many difficulties in teaching and
   learning the concept. One of the underlying sources of teaching and
   learning difficulties of the mole concept identified in literature is
   the gap in understanding the link between atomic theory and the mole
   concept. Therefore, the focus of this study was to assess teachers'
   conceptual understanding of the link between the atomic theory and the
   mole concept in selected secondary schools in Kitwe District in the
   Copperbelt Province of Zambia. The study was conducted in six secondary
   schools with a study sample of 30 chemistry teachers. Data were
   collected using the following multiple data collection strategies:
   questionnaire, lesson observations and focus group interviews. The study
   found that teachers understood how the atomic theory links to the mole
   concept in terms of the number (N) of atoms or formula units. They
   understood that a mole is equal to 6.02 x 10(23) atoms or formula units.
   However, their conceptual understanding of the link between relative
   atomic/formula mass and molar mass as the second linking idea between
   atomic theory and the mole concept was inadequate, because they did not
   fully understand relative atomic/formula unit mass and molar mass. The
   study recommended that professional development initiatives need to be
   organised with a focus on the updated definition of the mole and the key
   role of the unified atomic mass unit as the mass scale for microscopic
   entities in the understanding of the link between relative
   atomic/formula mass and molar mass. This is key for the conceptual
   understanding of the mole concept.}},

Title = {{Educating Internal Medicine Residents on Palliative Medicine and Hospice
   Care at a Community Teaching Hospital}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HOSPICE \& PALLIATIVE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{741-744}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Background:
   The Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)
   currently requires Internal Medicine (IM) GME programs to incorporate
   educational opportunities for training and structured experiences in
   Palliative and Hospice Medicine. Miscomprehension of the differences
   between palliative medicine and hospice care is a barrier for IM
   residents ordering palliative consults as many residents may
   underutilize palliative medicine if a patient is not appropriate for
   hospice.
   Objective:
   This educational performance improvement (PI) project assessed 3
   domains, including Medical Knowledge (MK) of palliative versus hospice
   medicine at baseline and following a single didactic session.
   Additionally, the number of palliative consults ordered was used as a
   surrogate for interpersonal and communication skills (ICS) and patient
   care (PC) domains.
   Methods:
   An 8-question survey and 30-minute didactic session were created based
   upon experientially-determined issues most confusing to IM residents.
   Participants included 33 IM residents (PGY-1s-3 s) from July 2018 (first
   cohort) and 32 (PGY-1 s and any PGY-2s-3 s who did not participate in
   the first cohort) from July 2019 (second cohort).
   Results:
   65 of a possible 73 residents participated (89\% response rate) Pre-test
   Questions 5, 6, and 8 correct responses were <50\% in both cohorts with
   average scores, respectively, of 43.1\%, 35.4\%, and 40\%. Residents
   improved on the post-test for Q5, 6, 8 to, respectively, 80\%, 86.7\%,
   and 48.3\% (t = 7.68, df = 59, p < 001). Correct Q1 responses declined
   in the first cohort, but clarification for the second cohort improved
   from pre-test (36.4\%) to post-test (65.5\%). The total number of
   palliative consults placed by IM residents increased as well.
   Conclusions:
   Baseline MK of palliative versus hospice medicine was <50\% on 4/8
   questions. A brief educational session significantly improved residents'
   short-term comprehension and increased the number of palliative
   consults.}},

Abstract = {{This retrospective study investigated foveal and perifoveal retinal
   sensitivities using microperimetry before and after surgery for
   rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD). Consecutive patients with RRD
   who underwent vitrectomy or scleral buckling were included.
   Comprehensive ophthalmological examinations, including microperimetry
   and swept-source optical coherence tomography, were performed before and
   6 months after surgery. Pre- and postoperative retinal sensitivities at
   the fovea and 4 perifoveal measurement points farthest from the fixation
   point, both vertically and horizontally (superior, inferior, nasal, and
   temporal) were examined. A total of 34 foveal and 136 perifoveal
   measurement points in 34 eyes of 34 patients were evaluated. The
   postoperative retinal sensitivity was significantly higher than the
   preoperative value at foveal and perifoveal points with (P<0.001 for
   both) and without (fovea: P=0.005, perifovea: P<0.001) RRD. The
   postoperative retinal sensitivity was significantly lower at foveal
   (P<0.01) and perifoveal (P<0.001) points with preoperative RRD than at
   points without preoperative RRD; furthermore, it was significantly
   better at points with ellipsoid zone (Ez) continuity than at points with
   Ez discontinuity (fovea: P<0.01, perifovea: P<0.001). RRD deteriorates
   retinal sensitivity, regardless of its presence or absence at the
   measurement point before surgery. Postoperative Ez continuity is
   important for good postoperative retinal sensitivity.}},

   irregular ridges, murtoos, eskers, deltas/sandur, outwash complexes,
   meltwater channels, boulder bars/sheets, the Timmersdala ridge, raised
   shorelines, sand dunes and prominent landslide scars (the last three are
   post-glacial). The area includes moraines associated with the Younger
   Dryas cold interval and drainage deposits of the Baltic Ice Lake.
   Additionally, the map reveals previously undetected geomorphic features
   including (1) murtoos, (2) abundant traces of meltwater erosion
   manifested as channels and hummock corridors, (3) laterally extensive
   end-moraine systems (the Remmene and Kungslena ice-margin positions) and

Abstract = {{Background In this cross-sectional study we investigated the oral
   mucosal changes in a middle-aged Finnish population. We analyzed the
   prevalence of potentially malignant disorders and the influence of
   smoking, snuff and alcohol use on the mucosal changes. Methods Of the
   12,068 members of the NFBC 1966, a total of 1961 participants (16.2\%)
   constituted the study population. Mucosal changes were diagnosed and
   photographed by seven general dentists, and two specialists re-analyzed
   all the diagnoses based on the documentation Cross-tabulation with
   Chi-square tests and logistic regression analysis were used to analyze
   the data. Results Of the participants, 10.5\% had some mucosal changes,
   of which 81.8\% were diagnosed as oral mucosal lesions (OML) and 18.2\%
   as normal variations. Of the normal variations, the most common were
   Fordyce granules (1.2\%), fissured tongue (1.1\%) and geographic tongue
   (0.9\%). The most common OMLs were white lesions (6.5\%), of which oral
   lichen planus (OLP) and lichenoid reactions (OLR), grouped as oral
   lichenoid diseases, were present in 3.5\%, males more often (3.8\% vs.
   3.1\%). OLP was found in 1.5\% of all participants, females more often
   (1.8\% vs. 1.2\%), while OLR was more common in males (2.7\% vs. 1.3\%).
   Leukoplakia was identified in 0.5\% of the population; twice more often
   in males (0.6\% vs. 0.3\%). Erythroplakia was not found. Current smokers
   had higher risk for oral mucosal changes than former or non-smokers (OR
   3.0, 95\% CI 2.11-4.28), and snuff, used occasionally or regularly, also
   raised the risk (OR 2.6, 95\% CI 1.48-4.70). Conclusions In the
   middle-aged northern Finland population, 4\% of OMLs were potentially
   malignant disorders, including OLR (2\%), OLP (1.5\%) and leukoplakia
   (0.5\%). In particular, smoking and snuff use increased the risk for
   having any oral mucosa changes.}},

Abstract = {{Stimulus equivalence is defined as the ability to relate stimuli in
   novel ways after training in which not all of the stimuli had been
   directly linked to one another. Sidman (2000) suggested all elements of
   conditional discrimination training contingencies that result in
   equivalence potentially become class members. Research has demonstrated
   the inclusion of samples, comparisons, responses, and reinforcers in
   equivalence classes. Given the evidence that all elements of a
   conditional discrimination become part of the class, the purpose of this
   study was to determine if class-specific prompts would also enter into
   their relevant equivalence classes. Experiment 1 investigated the
   inclusion of prompts in an equivalence class using abstract stimuli with
   neurotypical students enrolled in higher education courses. Experiment 2
   systematically replicated Experiment 1 using meaningful stimuli and
   individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. The results of both
   experiments demonstrated that class-specific prompts became part of
   equivalence classes with the other positive elements of the contingency.
   The results are discussed in terms of class expansion and the potential
   impact on equivalence-based instruction.}},

Title = {{A Prudent dietary pattern is inversely associated with liver fat content
   among multi-ethnic youth}},
Journal = {{PEDIATRIC OBESITY}},
Year = {{2021}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Objectives To identify dietary patterns associated with hepatic fat
   fraction (HFF), a measure of liver fat content and risk factor for
   non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, in a prospective study of 397
   multi-ethnic youth.
   Methods We obtained information on habitual dietary intake via the Block
   Kids Food Frequency Questionnaire at age 6 to 15 years ('T1') and 12 to
   19 years ('T2'), and measured HFF using magnetic resonance imaging at
   T2. We derived dietary patterns via principal components analysis and
   examined associations with ln-transformed HFF using linear regression
   models that accounted for maternal education, gestational diabetes
   exposure and smoking habits; and child pubertal status, BMI and physical
   activity.
   Results At T1, none of the dietary patterns identified were associated
   with HFF measured at T2. At T2, a Prudent dietary pattern characterized
   by high fruit and vegetable intake was inversely associated with HFF
   (-0.08 {[}95\% CI: -0.16, -0.00]). Similarly, increased adherence to the
   Prudent pattern across T1 and T2 corresponded with lower ln-HFF (-0.11
   {[}-0.18, -0.04] units). On the other hand, adherence to a Western
   pattern comprising fried foods and refined carbohydrates at T2
   correlated with higher HFF among non-Hispanic White participants (0.16
   {[}0.06, 0.26]). These findings persisted after accounting for child
   BMI.
   Conclusions Even in healthy youth, a diet high in fruits and vegetables
   is associated with lower HFF, whereas a diet high in fried foods and
   refined carbohydrates is related to higher HFF. Dietary changes may
   serve as an early preventive measure to mitigate liver fat accrual.}},

   protein-coupled receptor}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) mediate intracellular signaling in
   response to extracellular ligand binding and are the target of one-third
   of approved drugs. Ligand binding modulates the GPCR molecular free
   energy landscape by preferentially stabilizing active or inactive
   conformations that dictate intracellular protein recruitment and
   downstream signaling. We perform enhanced sampling molecular dynamics
   simulations to recover the free energy surfaces of a thermostable mutant
   of the GPCR serotonin receptor 5-HT2B in the unliganded form and bound
   to a lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) agonist and lisuride antagonist.
   LSD binding imparts a similar to 110 kJ/mol driving force for
   conformational rearrangement into an active state. The lisuride-bound
   form is structurally similar to the apo form and only similar to 24
   kJ/mol more stable. This work quantifies ligand-induced conformational
   specificity and functional selectivity of 5-HT2B and presents a platform
   for high-throughput virtual screening of ligands and rational
   engineering of the ligand-bound molecular free energy landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Recently we encountered two cases with mesonephric features,
   mesonephric-like carcinoma (MLC) of the ovary, and female adnexal tumor
   of probable Wolffian origin (FATWO). They are thought to be related to
   mesonephric remnants (or Wolffian duct remnants). Herein we describe the
   cytohistolgical features, differential diagnoses, and potential pitfalls
   in diagnosis of these neoplasms. On cytological examination, the case of
   MLC showed tight 3-dimensional clusters of overlapping round cells,
   corresponding to solid growth pattern seen on histological examination.
   Tubular architecture and papillary formations composed of neoplastic
   cells of medium size with scant cytoplasm were readily identified.
   Intraluminal eosinophilic secretions were better seen on histological
   examination. Additionally, areas resembling features of papillary
   thyroid carcinoma were noted. Mitoses and apoptotic bodies were not
   identified on cytology but seen on histological sections. The neoplastic
   cells were positive for CK7, CD10, PAX-8, TTF-1, and GATA-3, and
   negative for ER, PR, and WT-1 immunostains. In contrast to MLC,
   cytological examination of FATWO showed smaller oval to spindle
   monotonous cells without mitotic figures. Some cells contained
   paranuclear vacuoles and were arranged individually or in loose cohesive
   clusters. Other cells were closely associated with pericellular
   hyalinized basement membrane-like material and they were arranged in
   cohesive clusters as well. On histological examination, similar to MLC,
   the FATWO had areas with thyroid-like features, such as, intraluminal
   eosinophilic secretions, paranuclear vacuoles, in the background of
   collagenous stroma. The neoplastic cells were positive for CK AE1/AE3,
   calretinin, WT-1, inhibin, and CD10, and negative for CK7, PAX-8,
   GATA-3, ER, PR, and C-kit immunostains.}},

Abstract = {{A theoretical study is presented of the dispersion of surface plasmon
   polariton (SPP) and wave guide (WG) modes of a metal-insulator-metal
   (MIM) thin film stack. We study the dispersion of the reflectance and of
   the transmitted flux, originating from a local excitation source, of an
   asymmetric MIM air-Au-SiO2-Au-Ti-glass material system in the infrared
   and visible spectral region for a wide range of SiO2 and gold
   thicknesses, d(SiO2) and d(Au). In comparison to reference stacks of
   air-Au-glass or air-SiO2-glass, between 1.4 and 2.0 eV, the transmitted
   flux intensity is enhanced 12 or 25 times, in the emission direction of
   the in-plane wave vector k(rho)/k(0) approximate to 1.05 and for a
   thickness of dSiO(2)is an element of{[}300-700] nm, respectively. This
   enhancement is attributed to the coupling, through the avoided
   crossings, between the SPPair and WG modes. As the fields of the SPPair
   and WG modes are located in different regions of space the enhancement
   is nearly independent of the number of nodes in the WG mode. In summary
   we have identified sets of parameters giving rise to the observables
   enhancement. Therefore the present MIM thin film stack is a simple and a
   versatile system for the use in applications.}},

Abstract = {{We present an image processing method for accurately segmenting crop
   plots from Unmanned Aerial System imagery (UAS). The use of UAS for
   agricultural monitoring has increased significantly, emerging as a
   potentially cost effective alternative to manned aerial surveys and
   field work for remotely assessing crop state. The accurate segmentation
   of small densely-packed crop plots from UAS imagery over extensive areas
   is an important component of this monitoring activity in order to assess
   the state of different varieties and treatment regimes in a timely and
   cost-effective manner. Despite its importance, a reliable crop plot
   segmentation approach eludes us, with best efforts being relying on
   significant manual parameterization. The segmentation method developed
   uses a combination of edge detection and Hough line detection to
   establish the boundaries of each plot with pixel/point based metrics
   calculated for each plot segment. We show that with limited
   parameterization, segmentation of crop plots consistently over 89\%
   accuracy are possible on different crop types and conditions. This is
   comparable to results obtained from rice paddies where the plant
   material in plots is sharply contrasted with the water, and represents a
   considerable improvement over previous methods for typical dry land
   crops.}},

Title = {{Transformation of Pathology Reports Into the Common Data Model With
   Oncology Module: Use Case for Colon Cancer}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{22}},

Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Common data models (CDMs) help standardize electronic health
   record data and facilitate outcome analysis for observational and
   longitudinal research. An analysis of pathology reports is required to
   establish fundamental information infrastructure for data-driven colon
   cancer research. The Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP)
   CDM is used in distributed research networks for clinical data; however,
   it requires conversion of free text-based pathology reports into the
   CDM's format. There are few use cases of representing cancer data in
   CDM.
   Objective: In this study, we aimed to construct a CDM database of colon
   cancer-related pathology with natural language processing (NLP) for a
   research platform that can utilize both clinical and omics data. The
   essential text entities from the pathology reports are extracted,
   standardized, and converted to the OMOP CDM format in order to utilize
   the pathology data in cancer research.
   Methods: We extracted clinical text entities, mapped them to the
   standard concepts in the Observational Health Data Sciences and
   Informatics vocabularies, and built databases and defined relations for
   the CDM tables. Major clinical entities were extracted through NLP on
   pathology reports of surgical specimens, immunohistochemical studies,
   and molecular studies of colon cancer patients at a tertiary general
   hospital in South Korea. Items were extracted from each report using
   regular expressions in Python. Unstructured data, such as text that does
   not have a pattern, were handled with expert advice by adding regular
   expression rules. Our own dictionary was used for normalization and
   standardization to deal with biomarker and gene names and other
   ungrammatical expressions. The extracted clinical and genetic
   information was mapped to the Logical Observation Identifiers Names and
   Codes databases and the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED)
   standard terminologies recommended by the OMOP CDM. The database-table
   relationships were newly defined through SNOMED standard terminology
   concepts. The standardized data were inserted into the CDM tables. For
   evaluation, 100 reports were randomly selected and independently
   annotated by a medical informatics expert and a nurse.
   Results: We examined and standardized 1848 immunohistochemical study
   reports, 3890 molecular study reports, and 12,352 pathology reports of
   surgical specimens (from 2017 to 2018). The constructed and updated
   database contained the following extracted colorectal entities: (1)
   NOTE\_NLP, (2) MEASUREMENT, (3) CONDITION\_ OCCURRENCE, (4) SPECIMEN,
   and (5) FACT\_RELATIONSHIP of specimen with condition and measurement.
   Conclusions: This study aimed to prepare CDM data for a research
   platform to take advantage of all omics clinical and patient data at
   Seoul National University Bundang Hospital for colon cancer pathology. A
   more sophisticated preparation of the pathology data is needed for
   further research on cancer genomics, and various types of text
   narratives are the next target for additional research on the use of
   data in the CDM.}},

Title = {{Asset condition assessment model for healthcare facilities}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT}},
Abstract = {{Asset management of healthcare facilities utilizes technical and
   administrative strategies to extend the asset life cycle. This research
   aims to develop an asset condition assessment (ACA) model for a
   healthcare facility to predict and assess critical asset ratings
   considering various factors, especially patient risk space groups, and
   asset redundancy. Two modelling techniques were used to develop the ACA
   model. First, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to calculate
   the weighting criteria and ranking the factors. Second, the AHP and
   regression analysis techniques were combined into a single model to
   evaluate healthcare facilities' asset condition assessment. The
   integrated model was validated with 88.32\% average validity percent
   (AVP). The model was determined to be robust, and its results
   satisfactory. Finally, this research developed a numerical asset
   condition assessment (ACA) critical rating scale, which can guide
   capital renewals leaders in predicting and managing healthcare
   facilities' critical infrastructure needs. Ultimately, this tool can be
   used to improve the asset management of healthcare facilities, which is
   one of the nation's largest infrastructure sectors.}},

Title = {{Reliability and limits of transport-ventilators to safely ventilate
   severe patients in special surge situations}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF INTENSIVE CARE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Background Intensive Care Units (ICU) have sometimes been overwhelmed by
   the surge of COVID-19 patients. Extending ICU capacity can be limited by
   the lack of air and oxygen pressure sources available. Transport
   ventilators requiring only one O-2 source may be used in such places.
   Objective To evaluate the performances of four transport ventilators and
   an ICU ventilator in simulated severe respiratory conditions. Materials
   and methods Two pneumatic transport ventilators, (Oxylog 3000, Draeger;
   Osiris 3, Air Liquide Medical Systems), two turbine transport
   ventilators (Elisee 350, ResMed; Monnal T60, Air Liquide Medical
   Systems) and an ICU ventilator (Engstrom Carestation-GE Healthcare) were
   evaluated on a Michigan test lung. We tested each ventilator with
   different set volumes (Vt(set) = 350, 450, 550 ml) and compliances (20
   or 50 ml/cmH(2)O) and a resistance of 15 cmH(2)O/l/s based on values
   described in COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Volume error
   (percentage of Vt(set)) with P-0.1 of 4 cmH(2)O and trigger delay during
   assist-control ventilation simulating spontaneous breathing activity
   with P-0.1 of 4 cmH(2)O and 8 cmH(2)O were measured. Results Grouping
   all conditions, the volume error was 2.9 +/- 2.2\% for Engstrom
   Carestation; 3.6 +/- 3.9\% for Osiris 3; 2.5 +/- 2.1\% for Oxylog 3000;
   5.4 +/- 2.7\% for Monnal T60 and 8.8 +/- 4.8\% for Elisee 350. Grouping
   all conditions (P-0.1 of 4 cmH(2)O and 8 cmH(2)O), trigger delay was 50
   +/- 11 ms, 71 +/- 8 ms, 132 +/- 22 ms, 60 +/- 12 and 67 +/- 6 ms for
   Engstrom Carestation, Osiris 3, Oxylog 3000, Monnal T60 and Elisee 350,
   respectively. Conclusions In surge situations such as COVID-19 pandemic,
   transport ventilators may be used to accurately control delivered
   volumes in locations, where only oxygen pressure supply is available.
   Performances regarding triggering function are acceptable for three out
   of the four transport ventilators tested.}},

Abstract = {{Cefazolin is an antibiotic frequently used for perioperative
   prophylaxis. Data from healthy adults and pediatric surgery patients
   were pooled to refine a previously developed population pharmacokinetic
   (PK) model and to determine the optimal body weight cutoff for selecting
   fixed doses of either 1 or 2 g cefazolin to produce exposures in
   pediatric surgery patients similar to a single 2-g dose in adults.
   Regardless of dose used, cefazolin was well tolerated in pediatric
   patients. A total of 1102 plasma samples from 62 patients from 3 studies
   were available to assess the previous model. The pooled data set allowed
   for simplification of the model such that allometrically scaled
   clearance and volume parameters were found to provide a robust fit while
   removing unnecessary covariate relationships. Monte Carlo simulations
   using the final cefazolin population PK model suggested an optimal
   weight cutoff of 50 kg, in contrast to the previously suggested 60 kg
   for a single 2-g dose. Patients at or above this 50-kg cutoff would

Abstract = {{Several recent observations using large data sets of galaxies showed
   non-random distribution of the spin directions of spiral galaxies, even
   when the galaxies are too far from each other to have gravitational
   interaction. Here, a data set of similar to 8.7 center dot 10(3) spiral
   galaxies imaged by Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is used to test and
   profile a possible asymmetry between galaxy spin directions. The
   asymmetry between galaxies with opposite spin directions is compared to
   the asymmetry of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The two
   data sets contain different galaxies at different redshift ranges, and
   each data set was annotated using a different annotation method. The
   results show that both data sets show a similar asymmetry in the COSMOS
   field, which is covered by both telescopes. Fitting the asymmetry of the
   galaxies to cosine dependence shows a dipole axis with probabilities of
   similar to 2.8 sigma and similar to 7.38 sigma in HST and SDSS,
   respectively. The most likely dipole axis identified in the HST galaxies
   is at (alpha = 78 degrees, delta = 47 degrees) and is well within the 1
   sigma error range compared to the location of the most likely dipole
   axis in the SDSS galaxies with z > 0.15, identified at (alpha = 71

   Saddleback (AS)]. Herein, FS possessed nucleated cell numbers nearly
   twice as high as those of FP at Passage 0. SMSCs derived from different
   types of synovial membrane and genetic background show similar cell
   morphologies and immunophenotypes, which were assessed by cell surface
   epitopes and multilineage differentiation potential, but differ
   significantly in their molecular characteristics. In addition,
   transcripts of SMSCs from AS were more enriched in IGF-1 signaling and
   VEGF ligand receptor, while SMSCs from DL were more enriched in growth
   hormone signaling and bone metabolism. The results indicate that
   genetics and tissues play significant roles for SMSC characteristics so
   that SMSCs can be traced back to the original cell donor and be used for
   fine turning in applications of medical research and therapies.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term treatment with azithromycin is a therapeutic option in Cystic
   Fibrosis (CF) patients chronically infected with P. aeruginosa. It was
   recently shown that azithromycin has direct antimicrobial activity when
   P. aeruginosa isolates are tested in Roswell Park Memorial Institute
   medium supplemented with fetal calf serum (RPMI 1640/FCS) by broth
   microdilution. We now investigated whether (i) azithromycin might also
   be active against multidrug resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa isolated from
   CF patients and (ii) how in vitro sensitivity assays perform in
   synthetic cystic fibrosis sputum medium (SCFM), a medium that mimics the
   particular CF airway environment. In 17 (59\%) out of 29 MDR P.
   aeruginosa CF isolates MICs for azithromycin ranged between 0.25 and 8
   mu g/ml and 12 isolates (41\%) showed a MIC >= 512 mu g/ml when measured
   in RPMI/FCS. In contrast, MICs were >= 256 mu g/ml for all P. aeruginosa
   MDR isolates when tested in either SCFM or in conventional
   cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton Broth. High MIC values observed in CF
   adapted medium SCFM for both PAO1 and MDR P. aeruginosa CF isolates, as
   opposed to findings in RPMI, argue against routine azithromycin MIC
   testing of CF isolates.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{50}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{In evolutionary biology, choanoflagellates are broadly investigated as
   the closest animal ancestors. Under suitable environmental cues,
   choanoflagellateSalpingoeca rosettacan differentiate into two types of
   solitary motile cells. Each group is recognized by its own strategy to
   swim and its morphology. Moreover, under nutrient limited conditions,S.
   rosettaexperience a haploid-to-diploid transition evidenced by the
   presence of gametes. It is challenging to determine if there is a
   connection between the two types of swimming strategies and the male and
   female gametes. Therefore a current interest is to isolate and
   concentrate the fast swimming cells, for instance, using a microfluidic
   device. Following this aim we measured their body sizes and
   characterized their motilities. We determined that fast cells swim
   remarkably different from slow cells and proposed a phenomenological
   model to reproduce the observed dynamics. We solved the Langevin
   dynamical equations of motion using experimental parameters for
   choanoflagellates swimming in a confined flat microdevice divided by a
   wall of asymmetric obstacles. A systematic study of the directed
   transport efficiency was performed in order to optimize the geometry of
   the obstacles wall. Numerical results showed that fast choanoflagellates
   can be directed efficiently for a wide range of geometric parameters of
   the obstacles wall while slow cells are hardly directed independently of
   its geometry. The clear differences found in the rectification of fast
   and slow choanoflagellates suggest that an efficient micro-sorter device
   could be designed for further applications in evolutionary biology.}},

Abstract = {{Ocular rosacea in children is a rare but often underdiagnosed condition.
   It is typically associated with chronic blepharoconjunctivitis,

   recommended treatment consists of topical (eyelid hygiene, steroids,
   cyclosporin, lubricants) and systemic (antibiotics e.g. erythromycin)
   measures. This case series of 8 children demonstrates the efficacy of
   local 1.5\% azithromycin treatment together with eyelid hygiene in
   pediatric ocular rosacea. A further advantage of this topical treatment
   is that the required application of only twice daily for 3 days followed
   by 7 days without treatment is convenient and improves adherence to
   treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Plants from the Solanaceae family are known to be sources of several
   nutritionally relevant steroidal glycoalkaloids (SGAs). With the aim of
   quantitatively investigating the occurrence of the main SGA from
   tomatoes, eggplants, and potatoes in various food samples and evaluating
   their relevance in the human diet, a rapid single-step extraction liquid
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed. Over the
   course of isolating several commercially unavailable SGAs from tomato
   products to use them as reference standards, a previously unknown
   derivative was detected, structurally characterized, and identified as a
   novel isomer of esculeoside B-1 and B-2. After validation of the method,
   36 food items exclusively derived from Solanaceae plants were analyzed
   for their SGA contents and a specific occurrence of each alkaloid in
   tomato, eggplant, or potato products was revealed. This is the first
   study reporting quantitative data on the occurrence of esculeoside A,
   B-1, B-2, and iso-esculeoside B in tomato products obtained by using
   appropriate reference compounds rather than applying a semi-quantitative
   approach based on a-tomatine as a reference. Some of the analyzed tomato
   products contained the esculeosides in concentrations of >500 mg/kg,
   clearly indicating their relevance in the human diet and the need of
   investigating their potential bioactivities in the future.}},

   crystallizes in the cubic bipartite sodalite structure (Type-VII
   clathrate) with La atoms encapsulated within truncated octahedral cages
   composed of alternating carbon and boron atoms. The covalent nature of
   the B-C bonding results in a hard, incompressible framework, and owing
   to the balanced electron count, La3+{[}B3C3](3-) exhibits markedly
   improved pressure stability and is a semiconductor with an indirect band

Abstract = {{Type 2 diabetes represents a serious societal health problem due to the
   vulnerability to cardiovascular events. Diet therapy is the most basic
   treatment for type 2 diabetes. The present study was conducted to study
   the effect of a fasting-mimicking diet and specific meal replacement
   foods on blood glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Our
   study included 100 patients with type 2 diabetes who underwent a
   physical examination which were enrolled and randomly assigned as 50
   patients each to the test group (with low energy-specific meal
   replacement meals during a fasting-mimicking diet) and the control group
   (with specific meal replacement foods given normal adult doses). After 4
   months, efficacy indicators which were fasting blood glucose, 2-hour
   postprandial venous blood glucose, and glycosylated haemoglobin of the
   experimental group were all lower than those of the control group
   (P<0.05); observation indicators that include body mass index, waist
   circumference, blood lipids (triglyceride, cholesterol, and low-density
   lipoprotein), and blood pressure levels were all lower than the control
   group, and high-density lipoprotein levels were all higher than the
   control group (all P<0.05). Both groups of fasting blood glucose, 2-hour
   postprandial venous blood glucose, and blood pressure had a relatively
   stable downward trend, but the experimental group had a more significant
   decline. In conclusion, the study revealed that a fasting-mimicking diet
   and specific meal replacement foods can safely and effectively reduce
   weight and improve metabolic syndrome in patients with type 2 diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundMaternal wellbeing and quality of life (QOL) are increasingly
   being recognized as important for healthy pregnancies. The aim of this
   study was to investigate the impact of a pharmacist consultation on
   pregnant women's QOL focusing on nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP),
   and patient satisfaction.MethodsFor this intervention study in 14
   community pharmacies, women in early pregnancy were recruited and
   assigned to a pharmacist consultation (intervention) or standard care
   (control). The consultation aimed to address each woman's concerns
   regarding medications and pregnancy-related ailments. Data were
   collected through online questionnaires at baseline (Q1) and during the
   second trimester (Q2). The intervention group completed an additional
   satisfaction questionnaire after the consultation was completed. The
   primary outcome was the impact of the intervention on the Quality of
   Life Scale (QOLS) scores between the first and second trimesters. The
   impact of the intervention was assessed by linear regression, and
   secondary analyses were performed to assess effect modification by
   NVP.ResultsOf the 340 women enrolled in the study, we analyzed data for
   245. Half (170/340) of the original participants were allocated to the
   intervention group, of whom 131 received the pharmacist consultation.
   Most women (75\%, 78/96) reported that the consultation was useful to a
   large/very large extent. The consultation had no overall impact on QOLS
   scores between the first and the second trimesters compared with
   standard care (adjusted beta: 0.7, 95\% CI: -2.1, 3.4). The impact of
   the intervention on QOLS was greater amongst women with moderate/severe
   NVP (adjusted beta: 3.6, 95\% CI: -0.6, 7.7) compared to those with
   no/mild NVP (adjusted beta: -1.4, 95\% CI: -5.1, 2.2) (interaction term
   study group{*}NVP severity, p=0.048).ConclusionsThe pregnant women
   highly appreciated the pharmacist consultation, but the intervention did
   not affect their QOL scores compared with standard care. Future studies
   should further explore the effect of a pharmacist consultation
   specifically for NVP and on other outcomes such as use of health care
   services and medication use in pregnancy.Trial

Journal = {{ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{644}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Context. Near- and mid-infrared observations have revealed the presence
   of organic refractory materials in the Solar System, in cometary nuclei
   and on the surface of centaurs, Kuiper-belt and trans-neptunian objects.
   In these astrophysical environments, organic materials can be formed
   because of the interaction of frozen volatile compounds with cosmic rays
   and solar particles, and favoured by thermal processing. The analysis of
   laboratory analogues of such materials gives information on their
   properties, complementary to observations.Aims. We present new
   experiments to contribute to the understanding of the chemical
   composition of organic refractory materials in space.Methods. We bombard
   frozen water, methanol and ammonia mixtures with 40 keV H+ and we warmed
   the by-products up to 300 K. The experiments enabled the production of
   organic residues that we analysed by means of infrared spectroscopy and
   by very high resolution mass spectrometry to study their chemical
   composition and their high molecular diversity, including the presence
   of hexamethylenetetramine and its derivatives.Results. We find that the
   accumulated irradiation dose plays a role in determining the composition
   of the residue.Conclusions. Based on the laboratory doses, we estimate
   the astrophysical timescales to be short enough to induce an efficient
   formation of organic refractory materials at the surface of icy bodies
   in the outer Solar System.}},

Abstract = {{Nickel modified titanium dioxide nanotubes (TiO2-NTs/Ni) and TiO2-NTs
   electrodes are investigated for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). To
   obtain large surface area, TiO2-NTs are prepared by using anodization
   method at a constant voltage of 60 V for various anodization times (30
   min, 1 h and 2 h). Small amount of Ni is successfully deposited over
   TiO2-NTs via electrodeposition method. Hydrogen evolution activities of
   TiO2-NTs/Ni and TiO2-NTs are investigated in 1 M KOH solution at room
   temperature. Characterizations of prepared nano structured electrodes
   are analyzed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive
   X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and cyclic voltammetry
   (CV) and electrochemical-activities are determined through cathodic
   current-potential curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
   (EIS). Hydrogen volumes produced from prepared electrodes are also
   measured under constant voltage of 3 V for 30 min. Obtained results
   showed that hydrogen evolution activity increased with the modification
   of TiO2-NTs by nickel. High current density at specific overpotentials,
   hydrogen volume and small polarization resistance are obtained on
   TiO2-NTs/Ni. High stability and durability are also obtained on this
   electrode. So, TiO2-NTs/Ni as an electrocatalyst is suggested to use in
   water electrolysis systems. (c) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Title = {{Priming by Timing: Arabidopsis thaliana Adjusts Its Priming Response to
   Lepidoptera Eggs to the Time of Larval Hatching}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Plants can respond to eggs laid by herbivorous insects on their leaves
   by preparing (priming) their defense against the hatching larvae.
   Egg-mediated priming of defense is known for several plant species,
   including Brassicaceae. However, it is unknown yet for how long the eggs
   need to remain on a plant until a primed defense state is reached, which
   is ecologically manifested by reduced performance of the hatching
   larvae. To address this question, we used Arabidopsis thaliana, which
   carried eggs of the butterfly Pieris brassicae for 1-6 days prior to
   exposure to larval feeding. Our results show that larvae gained less
   biomass the longer the eggs had previously been on the plant. The
   strongest priming effect was obtained when eggs had been on the plant
   for 5 or 6 days, i.e., for (almost) the entire development time of the
   Pieris embryo inside the egg until larval hatching. Transcript levels of
   priming-responsive genes, levels of jasmonic acid-isoleucine (JA-Ile),
   and of the egg-inducible phytoalexin camalexin increased with the egg
   exposure time. Larval performance studies on mutant plants revealed that
   camalexin is dispensable for anti-herbivore defense against P. brassicae
   larvae, whereas JA-Ile - in concert with egg-induced salicylic acid (SA)
   - seems to be important for signaling egg-mediated primed defense. Thus,
   A. thaliana adjusts the kinetics of its egg-primed response to the time
   point of larval hatching. Hence, the plant is optimally prepared just in
   time prior to larval hatching.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundThe peak of the global COVID-19 pandemic has not yet been
   reached, and many countries face the prospect of a second wave of
   infections before effective vaccinations will be available. After an
   initial phase of viral replication, some patients develop a second
   illness phase in which the host thrombotic and inflammatory responses
   seem to drive complications. Severe COVID-19 disease is linked to high
   mortality, hyperinflammation, and a remarkably high incidence of
   thrombotic events. We hypothesize a crucial pathophysiological role for
   the contact pathway of coagulation and the kallikrein-bradykinin
   pathway. Therefore, drugs that modulate this excessive
   thromboinflammatory response should be investigated in severe
   COVID-19.MethodsIn this adaptive, open-label multicenter randomized
   clinical trial, we compare low molecular weight heparins at 50IU
   anti-Xa/kg twice daily-or 75IU anti-Xa twice daily for intensive care
   (ICU) patients-in combination with aprotinin to standard
   thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. In the case of
   hyperinflammation, the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist anakinra will
   be added on top of the drugs in the interventional arm. In a pilot
   phase, the effect of the intervention on thrombotic markers (D-dimer)
   will be assessed. In the full trial, the primary outcome is defined as
   the effect of the interventional drugs on clinical status as defined by
   the WHO ordinal scale for clinical improvement.DiscussionIn this trial,
   we target the thromboinflammatory response at multiple levels. We
   intensify the dose of low molecular weight heparins to reduce thrombotic
   complications. Aprotinin is a potent kallikrein pathway inhibitor that
   reduces fibrinolysis, activation of the contact pathway of coagulation,
   and local inflammatory response. Additionally, aprotinin has shown in
   vitro inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry. Because the
   excessive thromboinflammatory response is one of the most adverse
   prognostic factors in COVID-19, we will add anakinra, a recombinant
   interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, to the regimen in case of severely
   increased inflammatory parameters. This way, we hope to modulate the
   systemic response to SARS-CoV-2 and avoid disease progressions with a
   potentially fatal outcome.Trial registrationThe EU Clinical Trials

Abstract = {{Blue energy converts the chemical potential difference from salinity
   gradients into electricity via reverse electrodialysis and provides a
   renewable source of clean energy. To achieve high energy conversion
   efficiency and power density, nanoporous membrane materials with both
   high ionic conductivity and ion selectivity are required. Here, we
   report ion transport through a network of holey-graphene-like sheets
   made by bottom-up polymerization. The resulting ultrathin membranes
   provide controlled pores of <10 angstrom in diameter with an estimated
   density of about 10(12) cm(-2). The pores' interior contains NH2 groups
   that become electrically charged with varying pH and allow tunable ion
   selectivity. Using the holey-graphene-like membranes, we demonstrate
   power outputs reaching hundreds of watts per square meter. The work
   shows a viable route toward creating membranes with high-density
   angstrom-scale pores, which can be used for energy generation, ion
   separation, and related technologies.}},

   aramid nanofiber and edge-hydroxylated boron nitride nanosheet for
   thermal management applications}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITE INTERFACES}},
Abstract = {{Polymer-based dielectric films with desirable heat dissipation property
   hold great promise as thermal management materials in advanced
   electronics and high power devices. Herein, we report a new strategy for
   preparing thermally conductive films by synergistically combining
   one-dimensional (1D) aramid nanofiber (ANF) with 2D edge-hydroxylated
   boron nitride nanosheet (OH-BNNS) via a vacuum-assisted self-assembly
   technique. The obtained ANF/OH-BNNS film exhibits an ultrahigh in-plane
   thermal conductivity of 32.3 W m(-1)K(-1) at 40 wt\% BNNS-OH loading,
   which is 3530\% greater than that of the pure ANF film. The excellent
   thermal conductivity results from the special `brick-and-mortar' layered
   structure of ANF/OH-BNNS, in which the increased contacting and
   overlapping of OH-BNNS promotes the formation of the thermal conduction
   pathways. In addition, the rigid ANFs act as bridges linking OH-BNNS by
   favorable hydrogen bonding interactions, which efficiently enhance
   phonon propagation and stress transfer in the film. Moreover, the
   ANF/OH-BNNS film simultaneously shows low dielectric loss (similar to
   0.03), high tensile strength (similar to 88 MPa), and a high
   decomposition temperature (>510 degrees C). We believe that these
   findings are of great importance for the fabrication and practical
   application of thermal management materials in high-temperature
   electronics and devices.}},

   numerically simulate the coupling effects among the fluid-solid-thermal

   conditions of the pump, cooling characteristics of the fuel cooling
   shell are obtained through CFD results. Finally, an experimental system

   that fuel cooling shell plays an essential role in heat dissipating,
   with a maximum reduction of up to approximately 42 K in temperature.
   Temperature error between simulations and experiments is less than 4\%,

   Methods Daily fluid intake and access were assessed within the 24-hour

   Median (IQR) total fluid intake was 1.7 (1.6, 1.9) L/day. Fluid intake
   from beverages (P = .06) and water (P = .02) was higher in hydrated than
   impending/dehydrated patients. Of all fluid sources, only water intake

Abstract = {{In the scale-up of quantum computers, the framework underpinning
   fault-tolerance generally relies on the strong assumption that
   environmental noise affecting qubit logic is uncorrelated (Markovian).
   However, as physical devices progress well into the complex multi-qubit
   regime, attention is turning to understanding the appearance and
   mitigation of correlated - or non-Markovian - noise, which poses a
   serious challenge to the progression of quantum technology. This error
   type has previously remained elusive to characterisation techniques.
   Here, we develop a framework for characterising non-Markovian dynamics
   in quantum systems and experimentally test it on multi-qubit
   superconducting quantum devices. Where noisy processes cannot be
   accounted for using standard Markovian techniques, our reconstruction
   predicts the behaviour of the devices with an infidelity of 10(-3). Our
   results show this characterisation technique leads to superior quantum
   control and extension of coherence time by effective decoupling from the
   non-Markovian environment. This framework, validated by our results, is
   applicable to any controlled quantum device and offers a significant
   step towards optimal device operation and noise reduction. As quantum
   computing devices become more complex, they enter the realm of
   correlated noise, which is difficult to characterise and mitigate. Here,
   the authors demonstrate, over a range of superconducting devices, a
   method for non-Markovian dynamics characterisation based on the process
   tensor framework.}},

Abstract = {{Detecting individual-tree crowns provides a fundamental analysis unit
   bridging macro ecological patterns and micro physiological functions.
   This study adapted an anchor-free deep learning model, CenterNet, to
   detect individual crown locations and regions from dense 3 D terrestrial
   laser scans. A total of 1181 crowns from twelve plots were manually
   delineated as reference, among which eight plots were used for training
   the CenterNet, and another four independent plots for testing model
   accuracies characterized as the F1-score of location detection and
   Intersection over Union (IoU) of bounding box area. The maximum training
   F1-score and IoU were 0.881 and 0.670 over 40k training iterations,
   respectively. The result testing F1-score and IoU were 0.754 and 0.583,
   respectively. Five morphological factors were quantified to investigate
   the causes of accuracy variation among different plots and species,
   including crown area, tree height, full-width-at-half-maximum, nearest
   neighbor crown distance, and overlapping ratio of neighboring crowns.
   Results show that tree height was most important trait for crown
   detection. A taller, larger, smoother, less crowded, and less overlapped
   tree was found easier to detect. Among six species, red pine, Scots
   pine, and silver birch were successfully detected, and Norway spruce,
   lodgepole pine, and trembling aspen were more difficult to detect.}},

Abstract = {{The development of organic solids for applications in materials science
   requires a fundamental understanding of how close packing of molecules
   can affect structure and function. We report here nonporous organic
   crystals that release entrapped guest molecules upon application of UV
   light. We show components of binary cocrystal solvates to undergo an
   intermolecular photoreaction to generate ternary cocrystals that results
   in release of entrapped solvent molecules. The phototriggered guest
   release occurs in a single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformation that
   is in the absence pores and channels in the solid. The cocrystals are
   composed of a tetratopic hydrogen-bond-acceptor molecule synthesized in
   the solid state. The UV-light results in {[}2 + 2] photodimerization of
   an isocoumarin to generate a ternary cocrystal with cyclobutane
   molecules that support guest release.}},

Abstract = {{Controlling the in-plane symmetry of wide-bandgap semiconductor quantum
   dots (QDs) is essential for room temperature quantum photonic
   applications using polarization entangled photon pairs. Herein, we
   report the formation of 3-fold symmetric group III-nitride QDs at the
   apex of a triangular pyramid via a self-limited growth mechanism. We
   employed the in-plane rotational symmetry of the c-plane of a Wurtzite
   crystal and the large built-in piezoelectric field to reduce
   fine-structure splitting. The QDs exhibit emission that is
   distinguishable from that of sidewall quantum wells, and the
   biexciton-exciton cascade possesses a single-photon nature. We observed
   the relatively low optical polarization anisotropy and small fine
   structure splitting under the measurement limit (270 mu eV) with the
   3-fold symmetric QD. In contrast with current strategies that consider
   group III-nitride QDs as strongly polarized single-photon emitters, Our
   approach for controlling the QD symmetry provides a new perspective on
   such QDs, as polarization-entangled photon pairs.}},

Abstract = {{Investigation of the properties of particleboard panels bonded with a
   phenol-lignin-glyoxal (PLG) resin as a new type of wood adhesive was the
   aim of this research work. Thus, various contents of soda bagasse lignin
   (20, 30 and 40 wt\%) as a substitute of part of the phenol were used to
   synthesize PLG resins, coupled with glyoxal as a nontoxic aldehyde. The
   resins prepared were then used to bond particleboard panels. The
   physicochemical properties of the synthesized resins and physical and
   mechanical properties of the particleboard panels bonded with the PLG
   resins were measured. The thermal properties of the resins were also
   analyzed by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Finally, the
   properties of the resins and of the panels bonded with them were
   compared with those of a control PF resin and the relevant EN standards.
   The results showed that PLG resins, especially at the higher percentages
   of lignin, had slower gel time and lower viscosity compared to the
   control PF resin. DSC analysis also indicated that curing of a PLG resin
   with 30 wt\% lignin substitution needs a higher temperature than for a
   PF resin. Although the panels bonded with PLG resins presented weaker
   mechanical properties and lower dimensional stability compared to those
   bonded with PF resins their properties still satisfy the requirements of
   the relevant standards speci?cations. The results of this work indicated
   that panels bending and internal bond strengths, as well as their
   dimensional stability, decrease with an increasing percentage of the
   lignin content from 20\% to 40\% by weight, while the flexural modulus
   increases.}},

Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Background. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cause of
   cancer death in the United States and the third most common cancer
   globally. The incidence of CRC tends to be younger, and we urgently need
   a reliable prognostic assessment strategy. Methods. Protein expression
   profile and clinical information of 390 CRC patients/samples were
   downloaded from the TCPA and TCGA database, respectively. The
   Kaplan-Meier, Cox regression, and Pearson correlation analysis were
   applied in this study. Results. Based on the TCPA and TCGA database, we
   screened 6 hub proteins and first constructed protein risk signature,
   all of which were significantly associated with CRC patients' overall
   survival (OS). The risk score was an independent prognostic factor and
   significantly related with the size of the tumor in situ (T). 6 hub
   proteins were differentially expressed in cancer and normal tissues and
   in different CRC stages, which were validated at the ONCOMINE database.
   Next, 40 coexpressed proteins of 6 hub proteins were extracted from the
   TCPA database. In the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, HER1,
   HER2, and CTNNB1 were at the center. Function enrichment analysis
   illustrated that 46 proteins were mainly involved in the EGFR (HER1)
   tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance pathway. Conclusion. Studies
   indicated that 6 hub proteins might be considered as new targets for CRC
   therapies, and the protein risk signature can be used to predict the OS
   of CRC patients.}},

Abstract = {{China is transiting its power system towards a more flexible status with
   a higher capability of integrating renewable energy generation. Demand
   response (DR) and energy storage increasingly play important roles to
   improve power system flexibility. The coordinated development of power

   examines the significance of source-network-demand-storage coordinated
   development. Furthermore, an outlook of the power system transition in
   China is provided by virtue of source-network-demand-storage coordinated
   planning. The paper also assesses the integration of multiple urban
   infrastructures in China and its impacts on
   source-network-demand-storage coordination. Lastly, challenges for
   achieving the source-network-demand-storage coordination and suggested

Abstract = {{Tumor vaccines based on synthetic human papillomavirus (HPV) oncoprotein
   E7 and/or E6 peptides have shown encouraging results in preclinical
   model studies and human dinical trials. However, the dinical efficacy
   may be limited by the disadvantages of vulnerability to enzymatic
   degradation and low immunogenicity of peptides. To further improve the
   potency of vaccine, we developed a poly(lactide-co-glycolide)-acid
   (PLGA) nanoparticle, which encapsulated the antigenic peptide HPV16
   E7(44-62), and used adenosine triphosphate (ATP), one of the most
   important intracellular metabolites and an endogenous extracellular
   danger signal for the immune system, as a new adjuvant component. The
   results showed that PLGA nanoparticles increased the in vivo stability,
   lymph node accumulation, and dendritic cell (DC) uptake of the E7
   peptide; in addition, ATP further increased the migration, nanoparticle
   uptake, and maturation of DCs. Preventive immunization with
   ATP-adjuvanted nanoparticles completely abolished the growth of TC-1
   tumors in mice and produced long-lasting immunity against tumor
   rechallenge. When tumors were fully established, therapeutic
   immunization with ATP-adjuvanted nanoparticles still significantly
   inhibited tumor progression. Mechanistically, ATP-adjuvanted
   nanoparticles significantly improved the systemic generation of
   antitumor effector cells, boosted the local functional status of these
   cells in tumors, and suppressed the generation and tumor infiltration of
   immunosuppressive Treg cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. These
   findings indicate that ATP is an effective vaccine adjuvant and that
   nanoparticles adjuvanted with ATP were able to elicit robust antitumor
   cellular immunity, which may provide a promising therapeutic vaccine
   candidate for the treatment of clinical malignancies, such as cervical
   cancer.}},

Title = {{An audit of radiographers' practice of left-right image annotation in
   film-screen radiography and after installation of computed radiography
   in a tertiary hospital in Africa}},

Abstract = {{Background: Errors in radiographic image annotation by radiographers
   could potentially lead to misdiagnoses by radiologists and wrong side
   surgery by surgeons. Such medical negligence has dire medico-legal
   consequences. It was hypothesized that newer technology of computed
   radiography (CR) and direct digital radiography (DDR) image annotation
   would potentially lead to a change in practice with subsequent reduction
   in annotation errors. Following installation of computed radiography, a
   modality with electronic, post-processing image annotation, the
   hypothesis was investigated in our study centre.
   Results: A total of 72,602 and 126,482 images were documented for
   film-screen radiography (FSR) and computed radiography (CR),
   respectively in the department. From these, a sample size of 9452 made
   up of 4726 each for FSR and CR was drawn. Anatomical side marker errors
   were common in every anatomy imaged, with more errors seen in FSR
   (4.6\%) than CR (0.6\%). Collectively, an error rate of 3.0\% was
   observed. Errors noticed were as a result of marker burnout due to
   over-exposure as well as marker cone off due to tight beam collimation.
   Conclusion: Error rates were considerably reduced following a change
   from film-screen radiography (FSR) to computed radiography (CR) at the
   study centre. This change was, however, influenced more by a team of
   quality control radiographers stationed at CR workstation than by actual
   practice in x-ray imaging suite. Presence of anthropomorphic phantom in
   the teaching laboratories in the universities for demonstrations will
   significantly inculcate the skill needed to completely eliminate
   anatomical side marker (ASM) error in practice.}},

Abstract = {{Neointima hyperplasia is a crucial component of restenosis after
   coronary angioplasty. We have hypothesized that enhanced generation of
   platelet-derived thromboxane (TX)A(2) in response to vascular damage
   plays a critical role in neointimal hyperplasia and that antiplatelet
   agents may mitigate it. In cocultures of human platelets and coronary
   artery smooth muscle cells (CASMC), we found that platelets induced
   morphologic changes and enhanced the migration of CASMC. The exposure of
   platelets to Aspirin {[}an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1] reduced
   the generation of TXA(2) and prevented the morphological and functional
   changes induced by platelets in CASMC. Platelet-derived TXA(2) induced
   COX-2 and enhanced prostaglandin (PG)E-2 biosynthesis in CASMC, a known
   mechanism promoting neointimal hyperplasia. COX-2 induction was
   prevented by different antiplatelet agents, i.e., Aspirin, the TP
   antagonist SQ29,548, or Revacept (a dimeric soluble GPVI-Fc fusion
   protein). The administration of the novel antiplatelet agent Revacept to
   C57BL/6 mice, beginning three days before femoral artery denudation, and
   continuing up to seven days after injury, prevented the increase of the
   systemic biosynthesis di TXA(2) and reduced femoral artery
   intima-to-media area and the levels of markers of cell proliferation and
   macrophage infiltration. Revacept might serve as a therapeutic agent for
   percutaneous coronary angioplasty and stent implantation.}},

Abstract = {{The use of nanoparticles (NPs) to compatibilize immiscible polymer
   blends remains an ongoing challenge requiring a high level of control
   over the NP dispersion and localization. Here, we show that silica NPs
   ``sparsely{''} grafted with long polystyrene (PS) chains are
   surfactant-like because they permit core-core, core-matrix, and
   corona-matrix interactions. When placed at an immiscible polymethyl
   methacrylate (PMMA)-PS interface, the silica core strongly interacts
   with one component (PMMA), while the corona mixes with the other (PS).
   These carefully designed NPs are demonstrated to be efficient
   stabilizers, even outperforming block copolymers. While such
   surfactant-like behavior is evident, and understood on the basis of
   existing ideas, a new concept that we leverage is how the shape of the
   interfacial free energy profile is affected by the surface grafting
   density. For an optimally chosen grafting density and graft chain
   length, we find a nearly symmetric free energy profile as a function of
   the NP contact angle at the interface, ensuring that the NPs are
   strongly localized in a region where they are the most efficient in
   terms of stabilization.}},

Title = {{On-Chip Antenna Design Using the Concepts of Metamaterial and SIW
   Principles Applicable to Terahertz Integrated Circuits Operating over
   0.6-0.622 THz}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{This research work presents the investigation of realizing an on-chip
   antenna based on the metamaterial concept, which is working over the
   terahertz (THz) band for applications in integrated circuits. The
   proposed on-chip antenna is constructed of five stacked layers of
   polyimide and aluminum as top and bottom substrates, radiation patches,
   ground plane, and feed line. The four square-shaped radiation patches
   are implemented on the 50 mu m top-polyimide substrate, and the feed
   line is realized on the 50 mu m bottom-polyimide layer by designing the
   simple square microstrip lines, which are all connected to each other
   and then excited by waveguide port. The ground plane including a
   coupling square slot has sandwiched between the top- and
   bottom-polyimide layers. The coupling square slot etched on the ground
   plane is exactly placed under the patch to optimum transfer the
   electromagnetic signal from the bottom feed line to the top radiation
   patch. To achieve high performance parameters without increasing the
   antenna's physical dimensions, the metamaterial and substrate integrated
   waveguide properties have been applied to the antenna structure by
   implementing linear tapered slots on the patch top surfaces and metallic
   via holes throughout the middle ground plane connecting top and bottom
   substrates to each other. The slots play the role of series left-handed
   (LH) capacitors (C-L) and the via holes act as shunt LH inductors (L-L).
   The overall dimension of the proposed metamaterial-based on-chip antenna
   is 1000 x 1000 x 100 mu m(3). This antenna can cover the frequency band
   from 0.6 THz to 0.622 THz, which is equal to 20 GHz bandwidth. The
   radiation gain and efficiency across the operating frequency band varies
   from 1.1 dBi to 1.8 dBi, and from 58\% to 60.5\%, respectively. The
   results confirm that the proposed on-chip antenna with compact
   dimensions, wide bandwidth over the terahertz domain, low profile, cost
   effective, simple configuration, and easy to manufacture can be
   potentially appropriate for terahertz integrated circuits.}},

Title = {{Anisotropic electrical conductivity of magnetized hot quark matter}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{We studied the effect of a strong magnetic field (B) on the electrical
   conductivity of hot quark matter. The electrical conductivity is a key
   transport coefficient determining the time dependence and strength of
   magnetic fields generated in a relativistic heavy-ion collision. A
   magnetic field induces Hall anisotropic conduction, phase-space
   Landau-level quantization and, if sufficiently strong, interferes with
   prominent QCD phenomena such as dynamical quark mass generation, likely
   affecting the quark matter electrical conductivity, which depends
   strongly on the quark masses. To address these issues, we used a
   quasiparticle description of quark matter in which the electric charge
   carriers are constituent quarks with temperature-and
   magnetic-field-dependent masses predicted by a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model.
   The model accurately describes recent lattice QCD results showing
   magnetic catalysis at low temperatures and inverse magnetic catalysis at
   temperatures close to the pseudocritical temperature (T-pc) of the QCD
   phase transition. We found that the magnetic field increases the
   conductivity component parallel to it and decreases the transverse
   component, in qualitative agreement with recent lattice QCD results. In
   addition, we found that (1) the space anisotropy of the conductivity
   increases with B, (2) the longitudinal conductivity increases due to
   phase-space Landau-level quantization, (3) a lowest Landau level
   approximation behaves poorly for temperatures close to T-pc, and (5)
   inverse magnetic catalysis leaves a distinctive signal in all components
   of the conductivity, a prominent peak at T-pc. Our study adds to the
   existing body of work on the hot quark matter electrical conductivity by
   incorporating nontrivial temperature and magnetic field effects on
   dynamical mass generation. Our results are useful both for studies
   employing magnetohydrodynamics simulations of heavy-ion collisions and
   for getting insight on lattice QCD results.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of benzocaine-based anesthetic gel in anuran skins extracts:
   A case study using the frog Lithodytes lineatus (Anura: Leptodactylidae)}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{Extracts made from the skin of dead Lithodytes lineatus frog individuals
   with the application of the benzocaine-based anesthetic gel, introduced
   into the oral cavity, were analyzed by H-1 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance to
   investigate whether the application of this product (oral) can make
   studies that use extracts from the skins of these animals unfeasible.
   For comparison, we used skins of another species of anuran following the
   same death protocol. No trace of the benzocaine substance was found in
   the H-1-NMR spectra of the skin extracts from any of the tested anuran
   species. Still, using the hierarchical clustering model, it was possible
   to observe the formation of well-defined groups between the skin
   extracts of anurans and the anesthetic used to kill these animals. Our
   results suggest that the lethal dose of benzocaine in gel used inside
   the mouth of frogs may have no influence on potential results regarding
   the chemical composition or even bioassays using extracts made from the
   skin of these animals killed under this protocol since there was no
   detection of this substance for the analyzed samples.}},

Abstract = {{Water deficit is the most limiting abiotic stress to plants because it
   affects several physiological and biochemical processes.
   Brassinosteroids, including 24-epibrassinolide (EBR), are steroids that
   regulate growth and positively act on gas exchange. This research aims
   to determine whether EBR can attenuate the negative effects of water
   deficit, revealing possible contributions of this steroid on
   photosynthetic machinery of young Eucalyptus urophylla plants under
   water deficit. The experiment had a completely randomized factorial
   design with two water conditions (control and water deficit) and three
   levels of EBR (0, 50, and 100 nM EBR). Water deficit caused a decrease
   in the levels of total chlorophyll and carotenoids, but these
   photosynthetic pigments increased by 135 and 226\%, respectively, in
   plants sprayed with EBR when compared to the water deficit + 0 nM EBR
   treatment. Regarding the antioxidant system, 100 nM EBR induced
   significant increments in superoxide dismutase (42\%), catalase (52\%),
   ascorbate peroxidase (147\%), and peroxidase (204\%). Steroid
   application in E. urophylla plants exposed to water deficit increased
   the effective quantum yield of the photosystem II (PSII) photochemistry
   and electron transport rate. However, interestingly, it decreased the
   nonphotochemical quenching and relative energy excess at the PSII level,
   indicating improvements related to PSII efficiency. This research
   revealed that application of 100 nM EBR attenuated the negative effects
   caused by water deficit, being explained by the positive repercussions
   on antioxidant enzyme activities, chloroplastic pigments, PSII
   efficiency, electron flux, and net photosynthetic rate.}},

Title = {{The tipping point: mitigating the curvilinear effect of frontline

Abstract = {{Purpose Prior studies have mainly advanced the understanding of a linear
   relationship between leadership humility and employee work outcomes,
   mediated and/or moderated by various individual, team and organizational
   variables. This study attempts to advance prior knowledge by
   investigating a potential curvilinear relationship between leadership
   humility and frontline service employee (FSE) performance and the role
   of FSE's psychological capital (PsyCap) in attenuating this curvilinear
   relationship. Design/methodology/approach Survey data were drawn from a
   survey sample of 273 FSEs working in the hospitality industry of the
   United States of America. Hierarchical linear regression analysis was
   used to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings The results uncover the
   existence of a tipping point in the relationship between leader humility
   and FSE performance; that is, humble behaviors expressed by leaders
   positively influence FSE performance up to the tipping point beyond
   which FSE performance starts to diminish. However, this curvilinear
   effect is attenuated when FSE's PsyCap is high but not when it is low.
   Practical implications The findings provide service managers with
   insights into the importance of balancing their humble behaviors to
   yield optimal FSE performance. Furthermore, the paper points to the need
   for FSE's PsyCap cultivation within service firms so that FSEs are less
   dependent on their supervisors and can deliver highly satisfactory
   results. Originality/value This research is one of the very first to
   investigate the curvilinear relationship between leader humility and FSE
   performance and the moderating role of PsyCap in attenuating the
   curvilinear effect.}},

Title = {{Density-dependent condition of juvenile penaeid shrimps in
   seagrass-dominated aquatic vegetation beds located at different distance
   from a tidal inlet}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{Seagrasses are critical habitats for the recruitment and growth of
   juvenile penaeid shrimps within estuaries and coastal lagoons. The
   location of a seagrass bed within the lagoon can determine the value of
   a particular bed for shrimp populations. Consequently, differences in
   the abundance of shrimp can be found in seagrasses depending on their
   location. As shrimp density increases, density-dependent effects on
   biological parameters are more likely to occur. However, knowledge about
   density-dependent processes on shrimp populations in nursery habitats
   remains limited. The present investigation was undertaken to examine the
   effects of population density on shrimp condition in two selected
   seagrass beds, located at different distance from a tidal inlet, one 25
   km away (distant) and the other 1 km away (nearby), in a subtropical
   coastal lagoon. The study was based on monthly samplings during one year
   in Laguna Madre (Mexico), performing a total of 36 shrimp trawls (100 m
   2 each one) within each seagrass bed (n = 3 trawls per bed per month for
   12 months). Shrimp density was related to the proximity to the tidal
   inlet (higher density was consistently observed in the nearby seagrass
   bed), which in turn adversely affected the condition of both species
   studied (Penaeus aztecus and P. duorarum). In this regard, the present
   study provides the first evidence of density-dependent effects on shrimp
   condition inhabiting a nursery habitat. Both shrimp species exhibited a
   negative relationship between condition and shrimp density. However,
   this pattern differed depending on the proximity to the tidal inlet,
   suggesting that shrimp populations inhabiting the nearby seagrass bed
   are exposed to density-dependent effects on condition; whereas, such
   effects were not detected in the distant seagrass bed. Shrimp density
   within the distant seagrass bed was probably below carrying capacity,
   which is suggested by the better shrimp condition observed in that area
   of the lagoon. Infra and interspecific competition for food items is
   surmised to occur, predominantly within seagrass beds near the tidal
   inlet. However, this hypothesis needs to be tested in future studies.}},

Abstract = {{The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified the search for digital approaches
   in mental health treatment, particularly due to patients and clinicians
   practicing social distancing. This has resulted in the dramatic growth
   of videoconferencing-based telemental health (V-TMH) services. It is
   critical for behavioral health providers and those in the mental health
   field to understand the implications of V-TMH expansion on the
   stakeholders who use such services, such as patients and clinicians, to
   provide the service that addresses both patient and clinical needs.
   Several key questions arise as a result, such as the following: (1) in
   what ways does V-TMH affect the practice of psychotherapy (ie, clinical
   needs), (2) to what extent are ethical and patient-centered concerns
   warranted in terms of V-TMH services (ie, patient needs), and (3) how do
   factors related to user experience affect treatment dynamics for both
   the patient and therapist (ie, patient and clinical needs)? We discuss
   how behavioral health providers can consider the future delivery of
   mental health care services based on these questions, which pose strong
   implications for technological innovation, the adaptation of treatments
   to new technologies, and training professionals in the delivery of V-TMH
   services and other digital health interventions.}},

Abstract = {{LUTD is one of the possible factors influencing pediatric kidney graft
   outcomes. This study evaluates the results of a thorough assessment of
   voiding behavior in pediatric transplants. Data of patients with kidney
   disease of nephrological origin are compared to those with urological
   origin. A single-center analysis of pediatric kidney transplants
   performed from 2005 to the present was executed. Donor and recipient
   characteristics as well as voiding and drinking habits were documented
   using FVCs and uroflowmetry with PVR measurements. LUTD was defined by a
   mean MVV >150\% or <65\% of the EBC for age, abnormal uroflowmetry, PVR
   repeatedly >15\% of EBC or >20 mL, abnormal voiding patterns or
   behavior, and presence of LUT symptoms. LUTD was diagnosed in 71\% of
   the 56 screened children and more present in urological origin of kidney
   disease (100\%) compared to nephrological origin (61\%, P = .005).
   Individual presence of LUT symptoms, abnormal voiding behavior, FVC
   parameters, UTIs, and uroflowmetry/PVR parameters were not different
   between the two groups. Polyuria after transplantation was seen in 63\%
   of patients, mainly in the first post-transplant years and recipients
   aged <10 years. Time after transplantation was a significant independent
   predictive factor for the presence of LUTD. LUTD is common in all
   pediatric kidney recipients and underestimated in those with a
   nephrological origin of disease. Active screening, monitoring and a care
   attention plan prior to transplantation and during follow-up, is
   advocated to optimize outcomes for all patients.}},

Title = {{Differences in spatial versus temporal reaction norms for spring and

Abstract = {{For species to stay temporally tuned to their environment, they use cues
   such as the accumulation of degree-days. The relationships between the
   timing of a phenological event in a population and its environmental cue
   can be described by a population-level reaction norm. Variation in
   reaction norms along environmental gradients may either intensify the
   environmental effects on timing (cogradient variation) or attenuate the
   effects (countergradient variation). To resolve spatial and seasonal
   variation in species' response, we use a unique dataset of 91 taxa and
   178 phenological events observed across a network of 472 monitoring
   sites, spread across the nations of the former Soviet Union. We show
   that compared to local rates of advancement of phenological events with
   the advancement of temperature-related cues (i.e., variation within site
   over years), spatial variation in reaction norms tend to accentuate
   responses in spring (cogradient variation) and attenuate them in autumn
   (countergradient variation). As a result, among-population variation in
   the timing of events is greater in spring and less in autumn than if all
   populations followed the same reaction norm regardless of location.
   Despite such signs of local adaptation, overall phenotypic plasticity
   was not sufficient for phenological events to keep exact pace with their
   cues-the earlier the year, the more did the timing of the phenological
   event lag behind the timing of the cue. Overall, these patterns suggest
   that differences in the spatial versus temporal reaction norms will
   affect species' response to climate change in opposite ways in spring
   and autumn.}},

Abstract = {{The various experiments in community defense of organized groups in
   Guerrero and Michoacan, Mexico, to confront the insecurity produced by
   organized crime are occurring in a social setting in which legality and
   illegality are blurred-a grey area- as a function of regional economic
   reconfigurations that have fostered violence. The state uneasily
   tolerates the emergence of armed defense groups in the region by
   attempting to subject them to the model of citizen participation in
   security matters. Understanding these groups calls for supplementing
   current views about their various forms, which focus on their
   legality/illegality, with an emphasis on the relationship between them
   and the society and its dominant actors.
   Los diversos experimentos en defensa comunitaria de grupos organizados
   en Guerrero y Michoacan, Mexico, para enfrentar la inseguridad producida
   por el crimen organizado ocurren en un entorno social, un area gris en
   la que la legalidad y la ilegalidad se difuminan en funcion de las
   reconfiguraciones economicas regionales que han fomentado la violencia.
   El Estado tolera con incertidumbre el surgimiento de grupos de defensa
   armados en la region al tratar de someterlos a un modelo de
   participacion ciudadana en asuntos de seguridad. Para entender a estos
   grupos es necesario complementar los puntos de vista actuales sobre las
   diversas formas que toman, centrados en su legalidad o ilegalidad, con
   un enfasis en la relacion entre ellos y la sociedad con sus actores

Title = {{Ethical conflict during COVID-19 pandemic: the case of Spanish and

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL NURSING REVIEW}},

Volume = {{68}},

Pages = {{181-188}},

Abstract = {{Aim To identify factors underlying ethical conflict occurring during the
   current COVID-19 pandemic in the critical care setting.
   Background During the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak, Spanish and
   Italian intensive care units were overwhelmed by the demand for
   admissions. This fact revealed a crucial problem of shortage of health
   resources and rendered that decision-making was highly complex.
   Sources of evidence Applying a nominal group technique this manuscript
   identifies a series of factors that may have played a role in the
   emergence of the ethical conflicts in critical care units during the
   COVID-19 pandemic, considering ethical principles and responsibilities
   included in the International Council of Nurses Code of Ethics. The five
   factors identified were the availability of resources; the protection of
   healthcare workers; the circumstances surrounding decision-making,
   end-of-life care, and communication.
   Discussion The impact of COVID-19 on health care will be long-lasting
   and nurses are playing a central role in overcoming this crisis.
   Identifying these five factors and the conflicts that have arisen during
   the COVID-19 pandemic can help to guide future policies and research.
   Conclusions Understanding these five factors and recognizing the
   conflicts, they may create can help to focus our efforts on minimizing
   the impact of the ethical consequences of a crisis of this magnitude and
   on developing new plans and guidelines for future pandemics.
   Implications for nursing practice and policy Learning more about these
   factors can help nurses, other health professionals, and policymakers to
   focus their efforts on minimizing the impact of the ethical consequences
   of a crisis of this scale. This will enable changes in organizational
   policies, improvement in clinical competencies, and development of the
   scope of practice.}},

   impacting diabetes self-management}},
Journal = {{HEALTH EDUCATION JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{80}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{438-450}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Objectives:
   Military retirement happens early in the lifespan presenting a unique
   transition that challenges chronic illness. The purpose of this study
   was to explore the factors that military retirees experience as they
   transition from active duty to military retirement that they perceive as
   inhibiting their ability to manage type 2 diabetes (T2DM) or
   pre-diabetes (preDM) and/or which increase their disease risk.
   Methods:
   Twenty veterans diagnosed with T2DM or preDM participated in
   semi-structured, face-to-face interviews in a private setting at their
   primary care clinic. Transcripts were analysed using constant
   comparative method. Participants were aged 44 to 63 (M = 56), with 15
   diagnosed with T2DM and 5 as preDM. They had been retired from the
   military 6 to 22 years (M = 14 years).
   Results:
   Participants linked five inter-related challenging factors to their
   T2DM/preDM diagnosis (when diagnosed post-retirement) and/or to their
   inability to manage their disease: (1) diet/eating habits, (2) physical
   activity, (3) weight fluctuation, (4) health care interactions and (5)
   systematic barriers. Military retirees' experiences were embedded within
   a `cultural shift'. They struggled to maintain self-management
   behaviours once they were no longer on active duty and had more
   independence as civilians.
   Discussion:
   Results provide support for diabetes education during military
   retirement. Military retirees need help maintaining healthy lifestyle
   behaviours beyond the structured, health-focused military culture. They
   could also benefit from patient-provider communication skills training
   in navigating systematic barriers and attaining the support needed to
   manage their disease.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past 2 decades, several global burned area products have been
   produced and released to the public. However, the accuracy assessment of
   such products largely depends on the availability of reliable reference
   data that currently do not exist on a global scale or whose production
   require a high level of dedication of project resources. The important
   lack of reference data for the validation of burned area products is
   addressed in this paper. We provide the Burned Area Reference Database
   (BARD), the first publicly available database created by compiling
   existing reference BA (burned area) datasets from different
   international projects. BARD contains a total of 2661 reference files
   derived from Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery. All those files have been
   checked for internal quality and are freely provided by the authors. To
   ensure database consistency, all files were transformed to a common
   format and were properly documented by following metadata standards. The
   goal of generating this database was to give BA algorithm developers and
   product testers reference information that would help them to develop or
   validate new BA products. BARD is freely available at
   https://doi-org.ez54.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.21950/BBQQU7 (Franquesa et al., 2020).}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT}},

Abstract = {{Purpose This paper aims to explain the dynamics of entrepreneurial
   decisions and actions (D\&As) in the small and medium-sized enterprise
   (SME) growth process. The study focuses on the changing portfolio and
   relationship governance and captures these dynamics by using the concept
   of ``enabling constraints{''} (ECs). Design/methodology/approach
   In-depth, long-term and multiple-case study method was adopted based on
   six high-growth SMEs. Pattern-matching and alternative template approach
   formed a basis for developing a research framework, further corroborated
   and advanced in the empirical study. Findings The research provides
   empirical evidence of ECs as entrepreneurial perceptions that both limit
   (constrain) the range of accessible options and facilitate (enable) new
   opportunities. This study's results point to how owner-managers'
   judgments about growth motives and rationales constrain their choices
   and how they enable new directions, acknowledging the changing context.
   Originality/value This work contributes to the research on SME growth
   processes by specifying their dynamics in terms of a creative mutual
   causality. Here, D\&As stem from entrepreneurs' perceptions that are
   affected by the context, with the latter also shaped by prior decisions
   and actions. This theoretical contribution has been synthesized in the
   form of a framework of ECs in the SME growth process with related
   propositions.}},

Title = {{The patient as a policy problem: Ambiguous perceptions of a critical
   interface in healthcare}},
Journal = {{HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{The interface between the patient and the health service has changed,
   which constitutes a potential problem for various policy-makers. Using a
   critical policy perspective and drawing on the theory of problem
   framing, this paper explores how actor groups with different
   responsibilities perceive the patient as a constructed policy problem.
   This is a qualitative study where data consists of single episode
   interviews with healthcare politicians, senior administrators, service
   strategists, and unit mangers from one regional health authority in
   Sweden. A thematic content analysis of the interviews was carried out in
   accordance with ``the framework approach{''}. The study illustrates how
   the actors interpret their reality using diverse problem frames. This
   becomes more visible when the framing is disentangled with regard to
   what perspective they employ in relation to different accounts: society
   or the individual, or the (healthcare) system or the (healthcare)
   professional. The actor groups are part of the same institutional
   context, which explains certain tendencies of similarities in terms of
   the accounts being used, but still they approach the constructed problem
   differently which is visible as shifts-scaling up and down-between
   different accounts. By analyzing and structuring the various problem
   frames (including its policy styles) we can enhance our knowledge about
   how those responsible for the governance of healthcare approach the
   patient as a policy problem, as something that concerns only the patient
   and/or the provider, or as something that needs to be addressed in
   broader strategic terms.}},

Title = {{The essence of democratic backsliding in the European Union:
   deliberation and rule of law}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN PUBLIC POLICY}},
Abstract = {{This paper analyzes recent trends of democratic backsliding within the
   European Union (EU). While some scholars highlight threats to the rule
   of law and judicial independence as the key development and problem,
   others focus on elite discourse and partisan competition. We provide a
   comprehensive analysis of the essence of democratic backsliding by
   analyzing changes between 1990 and 2019 on key indicators of democracy -
   polyarchy, liberalism, participation, deliberation and egalitarianism -
   documented in the V-Dem dataset, within the European Union. We find that
   democratic backsliding at its core is structured by a deterioration of
   the quality of deliberation. Deliberation is also the component where EU
   member states differ amongst each other the most and which has featured
   the greatest deterioration in recent years. We conclude by spelling out
   the implications this has for EU policy.}},

Abstract = {{By the early twentieth century north-east England had become one of the
   heartlands of soccer, and its regional rugby union clubs were losing
   support. But from 1895 to 1914, following the emergence of a new rugby
   organisation, `Northern Union' (later known as `rugby league') in
   Lancashire, Yorkshire, Cheshire and Cumbria, rugby union clubs in Durham
   and Northumberland faced further difficulties. This paper explores the
   range of challenges they faced: isolated, separated by distance and
   geography from other rugby union regions, and heavily constrained by the
   national rugby-union regulations, suffering regular poaching, soccer's
   popularity, and the constant possibility of sides joining the new code.
   Crowds and revenue were declining, player numbers growing fewer, and
   club survival was often constantly under threat. Indeed, some clubs
   folded. In response clubs debated over principle, pragmatism and
   practice, especially over whether to adopt a league structure, like that
   for soccer, in the face of strong opposition from ultra-amateur
   officials nationally and regionally. Some clung to life financially only
   via members' subscriptions as attendance dropped, or by raising revenue
   through sports, all much easier for more middle-class clubs. Some
   achieved temporary success, perhaps by veiled forms of incentive for
   players. Most simply struggled to survive.}},

Title = {{Enhanced Acquisition and Retention of Conditioned Eyeblink Responses in
   Veterans Expressing PTSD Symptoms: Modulation by Lifetime History of
   Mild Traumatic Brain Injury}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{Enhanced acquisition of eyeblink conditioning is observed in active duty
   military and veterans expressing PTSD symptoms (PTSD+) and those
   expressing temperamental vulnerabilities to develop PTSD after traumatic
   experiences, such as behaviorally inhibited temperament. There is a
   growing literature showing persistent cerebellar abnormalities in those
   experiencing mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI(+)) as well as linkages
   between mTBI and PTSD. With the dependency of eyeblink conditioning on
   cerebellar processes, the impact of mTBI on eyeblink conditioning in
   veterans expressing PTSD is unknown. The present study assessed eyeblink
   conditioning in veterans during two sessions separated by 1 week. With a
   focus on the accelerated learning of veterans expressing PTSD, training
   utilized a protocol which degrades learning through interspersing
   conditioned stimulus (CS) exposures amongst delay-type trials of CS and
   unconditional stimulus (US) co-terminating trials. Faster acquisition of
   the eyeblink conditioned responses (CR) was observed in PTSD during Week
   1. The Week 2 assessment revealed an interaction of mTBI and PTSD, such
   that asymptotic performance of PTSD+ was greater than PTSD- among
   mTBI(-) veterans, whereas these groups did not differ in mTBI(+)
   veterans. To further examine the relationship between enhanced
   sensitivity to acquire eyeblink conditioning and PTSD, cluster analysis
   was performed based on performance across training sessions. Those with
   enhanced sensitivity to acquire eyeblink conditioned responses expressed
   more PTSD symptoms, which were specific to Cluster C symptoms of
   avoidance, in addition to greater behavioral inhibition. These results
   support the continued investigation of the conditioned eyeblink response
   as a behavioral indicator of stress-related psychopathology.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{Muscle fibers are the largest cells in the body, and one of its few
   syncytia. Individual cell sizes are variable and adaptable, but what
   governs cell size has been unclear. We find that muscle fibers are DNA
   scarce compared to other cells, and that the nuclear number (N) adheres
   to the relationship N=aV(b) where V is the cytoplasmic volume. N
   invariably scales sublinearly to V (b<1), making larger cells even more
   DNA scarce. N scales linearly to cell surface in adult humans, in adult
   and developing mice, and in mice with genetically reduced N, but in the
   latter the relationship eventually fails when they reach adulthood with
   extremely large myonuclear domains. Another exception is
   denervation-atrophy where nuclei are not eliminated. In conclusion,
   scaling exponents are remarkably similar across species, developmental
   stages and experimental conditions, suggesting an underlying scaling law
   where DNA-content functions as a limiter of muscle cell size. Muscle
   fibers are the largest cells in the body and contain less DNA per unit
   volume than other cells even if they have multiple nuclei. Here, the
   authors show that the number of nuclei regulates the cell size with
   similar scaling properties in mice and humans.}},

Abstract = {{Objective
   To analyze the clinical characteristics of patients with hydrocephalus
   secondary to cobalamin C (cblC) deficiency and to discuss the optimal
   strategies for assessing and treating such patients by performing
   clinical and laboratory studies in 70 patients.
   Methods
   A total of 1,211 patients were clinically diagnosed with methylmalonic
   acidemia (MMA) from 1998 to 2019. Among them, cblC deficiency was
   confirmed in 70 patients with hydrocephalus by brain imaging and
   biochemical and genetic analysis.
   Results
   Of the 70 patients, 67 (95.7\%) had early-onset MMA and homocystinuria.
   The patients typically had high blood propionylcarnitine and total
   homocysteine, low methionine, and methylmalonic aciduria. Signs of
   intracranial hypertension were relatively rare. We measured ventricular
   dilatation early in the disease by cranial ultrasound and MRI and/or CT.
   Eighteen different MMACHC mutations, including 4 novel mutations
   (c.427C>T, c.568insT, c.599G>A, and c.615C>A), were identified
   biallelically in all 70 patients. c.609G>A was the most frequent
   mutation, followed by c.658\_660del, c.217C>T, and c.567dupT. Three
   cases were diagnosed by postmortem study. Metabolic therapy, including
   cobalamin injections supplemented with oral l-carnitine and betaine, was
   administered in the remaining 67 cases. A ventriculoperitoneal shunt was
   performed in 36 cases. During the follow-up, psychomotor development,
   nystagmus, impaired vision, and sunset eyes improved gradually.
   Conclusion
   Hydrocephalus is a severe condition with several different causes. In
   this study, ventriculomegaly was found in 70 patients with cblC
   deficiency. Early diagnosis, etiologic treatment, and prompt surgical
   intervention are crucial to improve the prognosis of patients.}},

Abstract = {{Background This study evaluated 20-year survival after adult orthotopic
   heart transplantation (OHT).
   Methods The United Network of Organ Sharing Registry database was
   queried to study adult OHT recipients between 1987 and 1998 with over
   20-year posttransplant follow-up. The primary and secondary outcomes
   were 20-year survival and cause of death after OHT, respectively.
   Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify significant
   independent predictors of long-term survival, and long-term survival was
   compared among cohorts stratified by number of predictors using Kaplan
   Meier survival analysis.
   Results 20,658 patients undergoing OHT were included, with a median
   follow-up of 9.0 (IQR, 3.2-15.4) years. Kaplan-Meier estimates of 10-,
   15-, and 20-year survival were 50.2\%, 30.1\%, and 17.2\%, respectively.
   Median survival was 10.1 (IQR, 3.9-16.9) years. Increasing recipient age
   (>65 years), increasing donor age (>40 years), increasing recipient body
   mass index (>30), black race, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and longer cold
   ischemic time (>4 h) were adversely associated with a 20-year survival.
   Of these 6 negative predictors, presence of 0 risk factors had the
   greatest 10-year (59.7\%) and 20-year survival (26.2\%), with decreasing
   survival with additional negative predictors. The most common cause of
   death in 20-year survivors was renal, liver, and/or multisystem organ
   failure whereas graft failure more greatly impacted earlier mortality.
   Conclusions This study identifies six negative preoperative predictors
   of 20-year survival with 20-year survival rates exceeding 25\% in the
   absence of these factors. These data highlight the potential for very
   long-term survival after OHT in patients with end-stage heart failure
   and may be useful for patient selection and prognostication.}},

Abstract = {{With the aim of exploring the chiral resolution mechanism of the chiral
   covalent organic frameworks 6 ( CCOF6) chromatographic stationary phase,
   the ORCA program was used to optimize the structures of CCOF6 and four
   pairs of enantiomers. Then the molecular docking of CCOF6 with each
   enantiomer was performed by AutoDock program to obtain the initial
   interaction configurations of CCOF6 with four pairs of enantiomers.
   Energy calculations of the initial configurations were performed by ORCA
   program ( B3LYP functional with DFT-D3 correction, def2-TZVP orbital
   basis set, def2/J auxiliary basis set, and RIJCOSX used to accelerate
   the calculation) to determine the interaction configurations of CCOF6
   with four pairs of enantiomers and to obtain the corresponding binding
   free energy and binding free energy difference. Wave function analyses
   of ORCA calculation results were performed by Multiwfn program, and the
   weak interactions between CCOF6 and the four pairs of enantiomers were
   visualized by Visual Molecular Dynamics program. The results showed the
   following: (1) for calculating the binding free energies of CCOF6 and
   the four pairs of enantiomers, the ORCA method with the solvation effect
   was more accurate than the AutoDock method as well as the ORCA method
   without the solvation effect; (2) the greater the absolute value of the
   binding free energy difference between the CCOF6 stationary phase and
   enantiomers, the greater was the selectivity factor of the enantiomers
   but not the resolution of the enantiomers; (3) the hydroxyl group of
   S-1-phenyl-1-propanol interacted with the ether bond of CCOF6, but the
   hydroxyl groups of the other enantiomers all interacted with the
   carbonyl groups of CCOF6, and the binding force between
   S-1-phenyl-1-propanol and CCOF6 was the weakest; (4) from the peak time
   of the enantiomer and its binding free energy with CCOF6, it was
   confirmed that the elution ability of n-hexane / isopropanol for
   1-phenyl-1-propanol was the weakest, followed by the elution ability for
   1-phenyl-2-propanol; (5) the peak time of S-1-phenyl-1-propanol was
   longer than that of R-1-phenyl-1-propanol, while for the other
   enantiomers, the peak time of the R-enantiomers was longer than that of
   the S-enantiomers.}},

Title = {{Foundation Phase teachers' understanding of attention deficit
   hyperactivity disorder at Johannesburg independent schools}},
Journal = {{SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF CHILDHOOD EDUCATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: Attention deficit hyperactivity (ADHD) disorder is a common
   childhood neurodevelopmental disorder. The symptoms of hyperactivity,
   impulsivity and inattention often become evident in a structured
   classroom setting. Teachers play a key role in identifying these
   features and referring these pupils for assessments.
   Aim: This study investigated the understanding and perceptions of ADHD
   amongst Foundation Phase teachers at independent schools in
   Johannesburg.
   Setting: This study was conducted at nine independent schools in the
   Johannesburg area.
   Methods: A total of 95 teachers filled out a standardised questionnaire,
   the Knowledge of Attention Deficit Disorders Scale (KA DDS), which looks
   at three aspects of ADHD, namely, associated features, symptoms and
   treatment. The teachers also answered several demographic questions such
   as their sex, age, level of education, knowledge of a person outside the
   school with ADHD and confidence to teach a child with ADHD. An informal
   directed discussion group was conducted, which comprised 32 teachers who
   had filled in the questionnaire. Open-ended questions were asked during
   the discussion group.
   Results: The overall results were the highest obtained compared to
   similar previous studies. These teachers had a very good knowledge with
   regard to the symptoms of ADHD, they had a fair understanding about the
   treatment of ADHD and their knowledge about the associated features of
   ADHD was limited. Exposure to children with ADHD and higher number of
   ADHD workshops attended and ADHD articles read were beneficial to the
   teachers' overall knowledge about ADHD. Years of experience and the age
   of the teacher were not associated with a greater knowledge about ADHD.
   Conclusion: Independent school Foundation Phase teachers displayed a
   good level of knowledge about ADHD. This knowledge was enhanced by
   continual ADHD education and exposure to children with ADHD.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROINFLAMMATION}},

Abstract = {{Background Microglia are brain-resident myeloid cells involved in the
   innate immune response and a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. In
   macrophages, TonEBP is a transcriptional cofactor of NF-kappa B which
   stimulates the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes in response to
   LPS. Here, we examined the role of microglial TonEBP. Methods We used
   microglial cell line, BV2 cells. TonEBP was knocked down using
   lentiviral transduction of shRNA. In animals, TonEBP was deleted from
   myeloid cells using a line of mouse with floxed TonEBP. Cerulenin was
   used to block the NF-kappa B cofactor function of TonEBP. Results TonEBP
   deficiency blocked the LPS-induced expression of pro-inflammatory
   cytokines and enzymes in association with decreased activity of NF-kappa
   B in BV2 cells. We found that there was also a decreased activity of
   AP-1 and that TonEBP was a transcriptional cofactor of AP-1 as well as
   NF-kappa B. Interestingly, we found that myeloid-specific TonEBP
   deletion blocked the LPS-induced microglia activation and subsequent
   neuronal cell death and memory loss. Cerulenin disrupted the assembly of
   the TonEBP/NF-kappa B/AP-1/p300 complex and suppressed the LPS-induced
   microglial activation and the neuronal damages in animals. Conclusions
   TonEBP is a key mediator of microglial activation and neuroinflammation
   relevant to neuronal damage. Cerulenin is an effective blocker of the
   TonEBP actions.}},

Abstract = {{Deoxyhypusine synthase transfers an aminobutyl moiety from spermidine to
   the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) in the first
   step of eIF5A activation. This exclusive post-translational modification
   is conserved in all eukaryotes. Activated eIF5A has been shown to be
   essential for cell proliferation and viability. Recent reports have
   linked the activation of eIF5A to several human diseases. Deoxyhypusine
   synthase, which is encoded by a single gene copy in most eukaryotes, was
   duplicated in several plant lineages during evolution, the copies being
   repeatedly recruited to pyrrolizidine alkaloid biosynthesis. However,
   the function of many of these duplicates is unknown. Notably,
   deoxyhypusine synthase is highly promiscuous and can catalyze various
   reactions, often of unknown biological relevance. To facilitate in-depth
   biochemical studies of this enzyme, we report here the development of a
   simple and robust in vitro enzyme assay. It involves precolumn
   derivatization of the polyamines taking part in the reaction and avoids
   the need for the previously used radioactively labeled tracers. The
   derivatized polyamines are quantified after high-performance liquid
   chromatography coupled to diode array and fluorescence detectors. By
   performing kinetic analyses of deoxyhypusine synthase and its paralog
   from the pyrrolizidine alkaloid-producing plant Senecio vernalis, we
   demonstrate that the assay unequivocally differentiates the paralogous
   enzymes. Furthermore, it detects and quantifies, in a single assay, the
   side reactions that occur in parallel to the main reaction. The
   presented assay thus provides a detailed biochemical characterization of
   deoxyhypusine synthase and its paralogs.}},

   detection using mammographic data}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF DEFENSE MODELING AND SIMULATION-APPLICATIONS METHODOLOGY
   TECHNOLOGY-JDMS}},
Abstract = {{Any disease is curable if it is diagnosed at the early stages with the
   help of a little human effort. The disease breast cancer is the second
   leading cause of death among women after lung cancer. Mammography is one
   of the most mainstream clinical imaging modalities that are utilized for
   early recognition of breast cancer. Early breast cancer detection helps
   to alleviate unnecessary treatments as well as saving women's lives. The
   speedy development in deep learning and some of the strategies of
   machine learning have invigorated abundant enthusiasm for their
   application to clinical imaging issues. This paper presents an improved
   convolutional neural network (CNN) model that consists of three
   convolutional layers where the starting layer searches for low-level
   features and the ending layer searches for high-level features. Two
   activation functions, that is, the Rectified Linear Unit and sigmoid
   functions, are utilized for the detection of breast cancer using
   digitized film mammograms from the Digital Database for Screening
   Mammography. The proposed convolutional neural system for identifying
   breast malignancy on mammogram imaging achieved praiseworthy execution
   on examination with prior models. The experimentation found that the
   model achieved has a true positive rate of 99\% (accuracy = 97.20\%,
   precision = 99\%, true negative rate = 96\%, F-score = 0.99, balanced
   classification rate = 0.975, Youden's index = 0.95). The proposed
   improved CNN model can be used as a second opinion of doctors to detect
   breast cancer.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, the creep rupture behaviour and microstructural
   evolution of 2195-T84 Al-Li alloy are investigated at different tensile
   stresses. It is found that as the applied stress during the creep
   rupture process increases, the corresponding creep strain and creep rate
   significantly increase. Moreover, the evolution of microstructures,
   including precipitates, dislocation density and creep cavities at
   different stages is characterized using a transmission electron
   microscope (TEM), X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM). The main strengthening precipitates are identified as
   T-1 (Al2CuLi) and theta ` (Al2Cu) phases. Obtained results show that as
   the applied stress increases, T-1 and theta ` phases are gradually
   coarsened. This coarsening is more pronounced for theta ` phase.
   Furthermore, the creep cavities are mainly distributed at the interface
   between the insoluble second phase particles and the matrix, and their
   average sizes gradually increase as the applied stress increases.
   Meanwhile, the density and size of dimples on the fracture surface
   gradually decrease as the applied stress increases. Moreover, the main
   fracture mechanism changes from transgranular dimple fracture to
   quasi-cleavage fracture. Based on the microstructural evolution, a novel
   set of unified creep rupture constitutive model is proposed. The
   established model incorporates the evolution of microstructures,
   including the dislocation density, average length of T-1 and theta `
   precipitates and creep cavitation, and correlates microstructural
   variables with creep rate. The results calculated by the constitutive
   model are in good agreement with the experimental data, which validates
   the proposed model.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most celebrated achievements in polymer physics is the
   finding of simple scaling laws that correlate molecular behaviors with
   molecular size. Scaling relations of 2D macromolecules between the
   conformation and size have been extensively investigated in theory.
   However, in contrast to their 1D counterparts, the fundamental
   correlation of conformation with the size, bending rigidity, and surface
   interaction still remains unsolved in both experiments and theory. Here
   we report the scaling relations of 2D macromolecules by using
   single-layer graphene oxide as the model, underpinning a general
   framework to understand and measure their thermodynamic and rheological
   behaviors. Using Ubbelohde capillary rheology, we experimentally
   determined the Flory-type and Mark-Houwink-Sakurada scaling rules in the
   self-avoiding, good-solvent regime through the critical overlapping
   concentration (C-{*} similar to L-0.87, L is the lateral size) and
   intrinsic viscosity ({[}eta] similar to M-alpha, alpha = 0.33, M is the
   molecular weight). The measured exponent gamma = 0.87 is well located
   between self-avoiding (4/5) and rigid (1) limit, indicating a nearly
   flat conformation and semiflexible nature, and alpha = 0.33 differs from
   the value of polymers (0.5-0.8), signaling the dimensional constraint.
   The discussion of conformational size-scaling relations is complemented
   by dissipative particle dynamics simulations, which clarify the effects
   of size and bending resistance of 2D macromolecules as well as the
   solvent that tunes their surface interaction, resulting in conformation
   transitions among nearly flat, folded, and crumpled phases.}},

Title = {{Nurses' autonomy in sleep management improves patients' sleep quality: A
   cross-sectional study}},
Journal = {{NURSING IN CRITICAL CARE}},
Abstract = {{Background The current literature indicates that intensive care (ICU)
   patients' sleep quality is generally poor, which is associated with
   serious physical and psychological consequences.
   Aims and objectives To describe the practices nurses use to provide
   good-quality sleep to adult ICU patients and assess nurses' perceptions
   of patients' sleep quality and nurses' professional autonomy in sleep
   management.
   Design A descriptive-correlational, cross-sectional study.
   Methods A total of 232 ICU nurses from four hospitals in Poland were
   recruited. Data were collected between May and August 2019 using a
   previously developed questionnaire and analysed using descriptive
   statistics and non-parametric tests.
   Results A total of 119 nurses took part in the study (response rate:
   51\%). On average, nurses rated patients' sleep quality as moderate
   (4.44 +/- 2.23, scale 0-10). Most of the respondents (95.8\%) said they
   did not use any sleep protocol. Various strategies to improve patients'
   sleep were used sporadically (2.64 +/- 1.55, scale 1-5). The use of
   sleep quality assessment methods was positively correlated with
   patients' sleep quality (rho = 0.22, P = .02). Nurses' professional
   autonomy regarding sleep management was assessed as average (4.34 +/-
   2.43, scale 0-10) and was correlated with the patients' sleep quality
   (rho = 0.25, P < .01). Nurses who rated their autonomy in patients'
   sleep management more highly (rho = 0.29, P < .01) and more often
   influenced patients' sleep decisions (rho = 0.24, P < .01) used more
   methods to improve patients' sleep.
   Conclusions Strengthening the professional autonomy of ICU nurses and
   creating a reliable sleep assessment and improvement tool, which would
   describe strategies nurses can implement independently could increase
   sleep quality among ICU patients.
   Relevance to clinical practice Addressing organizational problems, which
   hamper the patients' sleep management by ICU nurses could result in
   using more strategies to provide good-quality sleep to ICU patients.
   There is a need for clinical guidelines regarding patients' sleep
   management to help educate and guide nurses how to independently use
   sleep improvement methods.}},

Title = {{A Control Strategy of the Air Flow Rate of Coal-Fired Utility Boilers
   Based on the Load Demand}},
Journal = {{ACS OMEGA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{48}},
Pages = {{31199-31208}},
Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{An analysis was conducted on the relationship between the calorific
   value of different types of coal and the theoretical air requirement. It
   was found that the theoretical air volume required for generating the
   same amount of heat during combustion is the same for different types of
   coal. The concept of the air/coal ratio was improved by proposing the
   concept of the air/carbon ratio, which refers to the ratio of the mass
   of air to the mass of carbon during complete combustion; the ratio is
   approximately 11.5 kg/kg (mass ratio), being roughly constant for
   different types of coal, unlike the air/coal ratio showing a significant
   change with coal types. The total air flow rate in a boiler changed with
   load demand, and the influence of different fuel types can be neglected
   at the same load level. On this basis, an air flow rate control strategy
   for coal-fired utility boilers was proposed and implemented in the
   boiler in which the air flow rate required to the furnace is a function
   of the unit load. Experiments conducted in a 300 MWe coal-fired utility
   boiler confirm that the use of the control strategy of the air flow rate
   for the combustion optimization improves the stability of the main steam
   pressure and mitigates the fluctuations of the coal flow. These results
   provide a foundation for the implementation of a new strategy of
   air/coal decoupling and independent control of boiler combustion.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Objectives Previous research demonstrates the utility of
   goals in attaining improved drinking outcomes. Considerably less is
   known about the association between substance use goals and outcomes
   among persons with comorbid substance use disorder (SUD) and
   posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This secondary analysis examined
   the association between alcohol use outcomes and participants' treatment
   entry substance use goals to either abstain or reduce substance use in
   the context of treatment for comorbid SUD/PTSD.
   Methods Participants (N = 39) were treatment-seeking veterans with
   current alcohol dependence and PTSD. Participants completed self-report
   and clinician-rated measures of substance use and PTSD as part of a
   larger randomized controlled trial.
   Results Participants in both goal groups (abstain; reduce) achieved
   significant reductions in the likelihood of drinking and the likelihood
   of exceeding low-risk drinking levels. The primary analysis did not
   identify significant differences in outcome between goal groups;
   however, the exploratory analysis revealed that participants with
   reduced use goals were more likely to drink and more likely to exceed
   low-risk drinking levels.
   Conclusion and Scientific Significance The findings suggest a moderately
   strong association between substance use goal and drinking outcome in
   the current study. Although the findings did not unequivocally support
   abstinence as a superior treatment goal, they offer a preliminary
   indication that abstinence may be an overall lower-risk option. These
   findings expand consideration of the utility of substance use goals and
   suggest that clinicians should invite consideration of abstinence but
   may need not limit integrated treatment for SUD/PTSD based on strict
   adherence to abstinence, particularly if low-risk use goals are
   targeted. (Am J Addict 2020;00:00-00)}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the transition of the solar wind turbulent cascade from
   MHD to sub-ion range by means of a detailed comparison between in situ
   observations and hybrid numerical simulations. In particular, we focus
   on the properties of the magnetic field and its component anisotropy in
   Cluster measurements and hybrid 2D simulations. First, we address the
   angular distribution of wave vector in the kinetic range between ion and
   electron scales by studying the variance anisotropy of the magnetic
   field components. When taking into account a single-direction sampling,
   like that performed by spacecraft in the solar wind, the main properties
   of the fluctuations observed in situ are also recovered in our numerical
   description. This result confirms that solar wind turbulence in the
   sub-ion range is characterized by a quasi-2D gyrotropic distribution of
   k-vectors around the mean field. We then consider the magnetic
   compressibility associated with the turbulent cascade and its evolution
   from large-MHD to sub-ion scales. The ratio of field aligned to
   perpendicular fluctuations, typically low in the MHD inertial range,
   increases significantly when crossing ion scales and its value in the
   sub-ion range is a function of the total plasma beta only, as expected
   from theoretical predictions, with higher magnetic compressibility for
   higher beta. Moreover, we observe that this increase has a gradual trend
   from low to high beta values in the in situ data; this behavior is well
   captured by the numerical simulations. The level of magnetic field
   compressibility that is observed in situ and in the simulations is in
   fairly good agreement with theoretical predictions, especially at high
   beta, suggesting that, in the kinetic range explored, the turbulence is
   supported by low-frequency and highly oblique fluctuations in pressure
   balance, like kinetic Alfven waves or other slowly evolving coherent
   structures. The resulting scaling properties as a function of the plasma
   beta and the main differences between numerical and theoretical
   expectations and in situ observations are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) causes hepatotoxicity in mammals, with its
   hepatocytic metabolism producing radicals that attack the intracellular
   membrane system and destabilize intracellular vesicle transport.
   Inhibition of intracellular transport causes lipid droplet retention and
   abnormal protein distribution. The intracellular transport of
   synthesized lipids and proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to
   the Golgi apparatus is performed by coat complex II (COPII) vesicle
   transport, but how CCl4 inhibits COPII vesicle transport has not been
   elucidated. COPII vesicle formation on the ER membrane is initiated by
   the recruitment of Sar1 protein from the cytoplasm to the ER membrane,
   followed by that of the COPII coat constituent proteins (Sec23, Sec24,
   Sec13, and Sec31). In this study, we evaluated the effect of CCl4 on
   COPII vesicle formation using the RLC-16 rat hepatocyte cell line. Our
   results showed that CCl4 suppressed ER-Golgi transport in RLC-16 cells.
   Using a reconstituted system of rat liver tissue-derived cytoplasm and
   RLC-16 cell-derived ER membranes, CCl4 treatment inhibited the
   recruitment of Sar1 and Sec13 from the cytosolic fraction to ER
   membranes. CCl4-induced changes in the ER membrane accordingly inhibited
   the accumulation of COPII vesicle-coated constituent proteins on the ER
   membrane, as well as the formation of COPII vesicles, which suppressed
   lipid and protein transport between the ER and Golgi apparatus. Our data
   suggest that CCl4 inhibits ER-Golgi intracellular transport by
   inhibiting COPII vesicle formation on the ER membrane in hepatocytes.}},

Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{Purpose This paper examines the influence of leader humility on
   knowledge sharing intention. Drawing on social exchange theory (SET), we
   test the direct and indirect mechanisms to explain the influence leader
   humility has on knowledge sharing intention. Design/Methodology/Approach
   A two-wave, time-lagged field study was conducted. We surveyed 252
   professional employees from Australia. Findings Results show a
   significant direct, positive association between leader humility and
   knowledge sharing intention. While leader humility had a direct,
   positive association with affective trust in supervisor and work
   engagement, it did not directly impact on organizational citizenship
   behaviors directed toward the individual (OCB-I). There were three
   SET-related, serial mediators in the relationship between leader
   humility and knowledge sharing intention. These were affective trust,
   work engagement, and OCB-I. Research Limitations/Implications Future
   studies should collect multi-source data such as peers' or supervisors'
   ratings of the focal respondents' work engagement, OCB-I, and knowledge
   sharing behaviors to augment single-source data. Future studies could
   adopt an affect theory of social exchange to further explore the
   relationships tested in this study. Originality/Value This study
   contributes to the affect SET and knowledge management literature on how
   leadership behaviors impact the intention to share knowledge. Our study
   highlights the preference of the willingness to share knowledge with
   their co-workers is mediated by affective trust in their immediate
   supervisors, work engagement, and OCB-I that are equally important as
   treating their subordinates with humility.}},

   analyze a more complex phenomenological model where the relaxation of

Abstract = {{Endozoochory is known as an important mechanism for the spread of weeds.
   We carried out experiments to assess the fate of seeds of several weed
   species (Convolvulus arvensis, Cuscuta campestris, Rumex crispus,
   Hordeum spontaneum and Sorghum halepense) after passing through the gut
   of sheep and goat. Eighteen animals of both sheep and goat received diet
   mixed with seeds of the weed species or control with only wheat bran
   (five weed species + control x three replications). Results showed that
   a higher proportion of seeds were missing after passage through the
   sheep gut than in goats. In goats, a greater proportion of seeds were
   dead after passage, but the number of seeds collected from dung was also
   greater. Weed species differed, with the highest seed recovery and
   viability in Cuscuta campestris. Based on time of seed passages through
   the animal gut estimated for the different weed species, we recommend
   that sheep should be kept in a corral for 96 hr to minimise seed
   transportation via their faeces. For goats, if R. crispus and C.
   arvensis seeds could be excluded from the diet, then maintaining them
   for 96 hr in an animal stall would ensure little seed transportation via
   dung, but we found R. crispus and C. arvensis seeds to be present and
   viable in goat dung even 120 hr after feeding. Very large numbers of
   viable seeds can be found in goat and sheep dung, so the use of rotted
   manure is highly recommended to avoid transportation of viable seeds via
   manure fertilisers.}},

   Activity of the SARS-CoV-2 Papain-Like Protease: in silico Molecular
   Docking Studies and in vitro Enzymatic Activity Assay}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{COVID-19 is an ongoing pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus with
   important political, socio-economic, and public health consequences.
   Inhibiting replication represents an important antiviral approach, and
   in this context two viral proteases, the SARS-CoV-2 main and papain-like
   proteases (PLpro), which cleave pp1a and pp1ab polypeptides, are
   critical. Along with protease activity, the PLpro possesses
   deubiquitinating activity, which is important in immune regulation.
   Naphthalene-based inhibitors, such as the well-investigated GRL-0617
   compound, have been shown to possess dual effects, inhibiting both
   protease and deubiquitinating activity of the PLpro. Rather than binding
   to the canonical catalytic triad, these type of non-covalent inhibitors
   target an adjacent pocket, the naphthalene-inhibitor binding site. Using
   a high-throughput screen, we have previously identified the dietary
   hypericin, rutin, and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside compounds as potential
   protease inhibitors targeting the naphthalene-inhibitor binding site.
   Here, our aim was to investigate the binding characteristics of these
   compounds to the PLpro, and to evaluate deubiquitinating activity, by
   analyzing seven different PLpro crystal structures. Molecular docking
   highlighted the relatively high affinity of GRL-0617 and dietary
   compounds. In contrast binding of the small molecules was abolished in
   the presence of ubiquitin in the palm subdomain of the PLpro. Further,
   docking the small molecules in the naphthalene-inhibitor binding site,
   followed by protein-protein docking revealed displacement of ubiquitin
   in a conformation inconsistent with functional activity. Finally, the
   deubiquitinating activity was validated in vitro using an enzymatic
   activity assay. The findings indicated that the dietary compounds
   inhibited deubiquitinase activity in the micromolar range with an order
   of activity of GRL-0167, hypericin >> rutin, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside >
   epigallocatechin gallate, epicatechin gallate, and cefotaxime. Our
   findings are in accordance with mechanisms and potential antiviral
   effects of the naphthalene-based, GRL-0617 inhibitor, which is currently
   progressing in preclinical trials. Further, our findings indicate that
   in particular hypericin, rutin, and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, represent
   suitable candidates for subsequent evaluation as PLpro inhibitors.}},

   Lactiplantibacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum strains (isolated from
   oat, lucerne, sorghum, or maize) were selected for their growth
   capacity. Identity (16S sequencing) and diversity (RAPD-PCR) were
   confirmed. Fermentative capacity (inoculated at 10(4), 10(5), 10(6),
   10(7) CFU/g) was studied in maize silage and their cross-fermentation
   capacity was assessed in oat, lucerne, sorghum, and maize.
   Heterofermentative strains with the highest acetic acid production
   capacity conferred higher aerobic stability to maize silages. Regardless
   the source of isolation, L. plantarum strains, inoculated at a rate of
   10(6) CFU/g, were effective to produce silage from different plant
   materials. From more than 100 isolates obtained, the application of a
   succession of experiments allowed us to narrow down the number of
   potential candidates of silage inoculants to two strains. Based on the
   studies made, L. plantarum LpM15 and Limosilactobacillus fermentum LfM1
   showed potential to be used as inoculants, however further studies are
   needed to determine their performance when inoculated together. The
   former because it positively influenced different quality parameters in
   oat, lucerne, sorghum, and maize silage, and the latter because of its
   capacity to confer enhanced aerobic stability to maize silage. The rest
   of the strains constitute a valuable collection of autochthonous strains
   that will be further studied in the future for new applications in
   animal or human foods.}},

Abstract = {{Soybean (Glycine max) yields are threatened by multiple stresses
   including soil salinity. GmSALT3 (a cation-proton exchanger protein)
   confers net shoot exclusion for both Na+ and Cl- and improves salt
   tolerance of soybean; however, how the ER-localized GmSALT3 achieves
   this is unknown. Here, GmSALT3's function was investigated in
   heterologous systems and near isogenic lines that contained the
   full-length GmSALT3 (NIL-T; salt-tolerant) or a truncated transcript
   Gmsalt3 (NIL-S; salt-sensitive). GmSALT3 restored growth of
   K+-uptake-defective Escherichia coli and contributed towards net influx
   and accumulation of Na+, K+ and Cl- in Xenopus laevis oocytes, while
   Gmsalt3 was non-functional. Time-course analysis of NILs confirmed shoot
   Cl- exclusion occurs distinctly from Na+ exclusion. Grafting showed that
   shoot Na+ exclusion occurs via a root xylem-based mechanism; in
   contrast, NIL-T plants exhibited significantly greater Cl- content in
   both the stem xylem and phloem sap compared to NIL-S, indicating that
   shoot Cl- exclusion likely depends upon novel phloem-based Cl-
   recirculation. NIL-T shoots grafted on NIL-S roots contained low shoot
   Cl-, which confirmed that Cl- recirculation is dependent on the presence
   of GmSALT3 in shoots. Overall, these findings provide new insights on
   GmSALT3's impact on salinity tolerance and reveal a novel mechanism for
   shoot Cl- exclusion in plants.}},

Title = {{Contrasting genetic diversity and structure among Malagasy Ralstonia

Abstract = {{The Ralstonia solanacearum species complex (RSSC), composed of three
   species and four phylotypes, are globally distributed soil-borne
   bacteria with a very broad host range. In 2009, a devastating potato
   bacterial wilt outbreak was declared in the central highlands of
   Madagascar, which reduced the production of vegetable crops including
   potato, eggplant, tomato and pepper. A molecular epidemiology study of
   Malagasy RSSC strains carried out between 2013 and 2017 identified R.
   pseudosolanacearum (phylotypes I and III) and R. solanacearum (phylotype
   II). A previously published population biology analysis of phylotypes II
   and III using two MultiLocus Variable Number of Tandem Repeats Analysis
   (MLVA) schemes revealed an emergent epidemic phylotype II (sequevar 1)
   group and endemic phylotype III isolates. We developed an optimized MLVA
   scheme (RS1-MLVA14) to characterize phylotype I strains in Madagascar to
   understand their genetic diversity and structure. The collection
   included isolates from 16 fields of different Solanaceae species sampled
   in Analamanga and Itasy regions (highlands) in 2013 (123 strains) and in
   Atsinanana region (lowlands) in 2006 (25 strains). Thirty-one haplotypes
   were identified, two of them being particularly prevalent: MT007
   (30.14\%) and MT004 (16.44\%) (sequevar 18). Genetic diversity analysis
   revealed a significant contrasting level of diversity according to
   elevation and sampling region. More diverse at low altitude than at high
   altitude, the Malagasy phylotype I isolates were structured in two
   clusters, probably resulting from different historical introductions.
   Interestingly, the most prevalent Malagasy phylotype I isolates were
   genetically distant from regional and worldwide isolates. In this work,
   we demonstrated that the RS1-MLVA14 scheme can resolve differences from
   regional to field scales and is thus suited for deciphering the
   epidemiology of phylotype I populations.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrogen (N) uptake is a key process in stream ecosystems that is
   mediated mainly by benthic microorganisms (biofilms on different
   substrata) and has implications for the biogeochemical fluxes at
   catchment scale and beyond. Here, we focused on the drivers of
   assimilatory N uptake, especially the effects of hydromorphology and
   other environmental constraints, across three spatial scales: micro,
   meso and reach. In two seasons (summer and spring), we performed
   whole-reach N-15-labelled ammonium injection experiments in two montane,
   gravel-bed stream reaches with riffle-pool sequences. N uptake was
   highest in epilithic biofilms, thallophytes and roots (min-max range
   0.2-545.2 mg N m(-2) day(-1)) and lowest in leaves, wood and fine
   benthic organic matter (0.05-209.2 mg N m(-2) day(-1)). At the
   microscale, N uptake of all primary uptake compartments except wood was
   higher in riffles than in pools. At the mesoscale, hydromorphology
   determined the distribution of primary uptake compartments, with
   fast-flowing riffles being dominated by biologically more active
   compartments and pools being dominated by biologically less active
   compartments. Despite a lower biomass of primary uptake compartments,
   mesoscale N uptake was 1.7-3.0 times higher in riffles than in pools. At
   reach scale, N uptake ranged from 79.6 to 334.1 mg N m(-2) day(-1).
   Highest reach-scale N uptake was caused by a bloom of thallopyhtes,
   mainly filamentous autotrophs, during stable low discharge and high
   light conditions. Our results reveal the important role of
   hydromorphologic sorting of primary uptake compartments at mesoscale as
   a controlling factor for reach-scale N uptake in streams.}},

Abstract = {{Although research into trauma and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is
   critical to informing evidence-based interventions, IRB committees
   express caution about the potential safety concerns these questions pose

   of participating in research asking questions about trauma and NSSI. A
   total of 544 participants completed self-report questionnaires assessing
   trauma exposure, NSSI, and reactions to research participation. Results
   indicated that trauma exposure was positively related with emotional
   reactions, and NSSI engagement was associated with higher incidences of
   trauma. Additionally, those with a history of NSSI reported greater
   emotional reactions and perceived drawbacks after participation.
   However, overall, individuals with a history of NSSI still indicated a
   positive research experience. Implications for how to safely conduct
   research with participants who have a history of NSSI and previous
   trauma exposure are discussed.}},

   (PCNSL) had been cured by systemic and intraventricular methotrexate-
   and cytarabine-based chemotherapy (Bonn protocol) after a very long-term
   follow-up of nearly 20 years.
   Methods
   Sixty-five patients (median age 62 years, range 27-75; median Karnofsky
   performance score 70, range 20-90) had been treated with systemic and
   intraventricular polychemotherapy without whole brain radiotherapy from
   September 1995 until December 2001. All patients still alive in 2019
   were contacted and interviewed on their current life situation.
   Results
   Median follow-up for surviving patients was 19.6 years (17.5-23.3
   years). Out of 65 patients, 11 (17\%) were still alive. Six of those
   never experienced any relapse. For the whole study population, median
   overall survival (OS) was 4.4 years (95\% confidence interval {[}CI]
   2.9-5.9); for patients <= 60 years, 11.0 years (95\% CI 4.8-17.0). The
   10-year OS rate for the entire cohort was 29\% and the estimated 20-year
   OS rate was 19\%. Four late relapses were observed after 9.8, 10.3,
   13.3, and 21.0 years.
   Conclusion
   At a median follow-up of 19.6 years, 17\% of patients were alive and
   free of tumor; however, even after response for decades, an inherent
   risk of relapse, either systemic or cerebral, characterizes the biology
   of PCNSL.
   Classification of evidence
   This work provides Class III evidence that PCNSL treatment with
   methotrexate-based polychemotherapy including intraventricular therapy
   is associated with long-term disease control in some patients.}},

Title = {{Intense Pulsed Light as a Treatment for Senile Purpura: A Pilot Study}},
Journal = {{LASERS IN SURGERY AND MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{926-934}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background and Objectives Senile purpura is a common condition
   characterized by recurrent ecchymoses in the elderly on the extensor
   surfaces of the forearms, hands, and legs. Our objective is to assess
   the efficacy and safety of a protocol using intense pulsed light (BBL;
   Sciton Inc., Palo Alto, CA) to improve the appearance of senile purpura
   on subjects' extensor forearms.
   Study Design/Materials and Methods Five subjects over 65 years of age,
   with ecchymotic lesions measuring over 1 cm on each forearm and five
   younger subjects under 35 years of age, without any ecchymotic lesions,
   were included in the study. The subjects were treated on one randomized
   forearm with a new intense pulsed light protocol for four weekly
   sessions. Photographs and subject questionnaires were taken weekly
   before each treatment as well as 1 month after all treatments. Skin
   biopsies were taken 1 day after the last of four weekly treatments.
   Histological analysis, including hematoxylin and eosin, elastic van
   Gieson, and Masson's Trichrome staining, were carried out to assess both
   the epidermal thickness and dermal connective tissue structure.
   The protocol consists of multiple passes using an intense pulsed light
   (BBL; Sciton Inc.) device in which the wavelength, filter, and fluence
   are adjusted for each step. Step 1 uses infrared light (800-1,400 nm),
   high intensity, a smooth adapter, and a constant motion technique. Step
   2 employs a 590-nm filter with two different fluences and step 3
   utilizes a 560-nm filter. The fluence of steps 2-3 is increased by 1 J
   each treatment if no side effects are noted.
   Results Using a new intense pulsed light protocol in subjects with
   senile purpura, both the number and square area of ecchymoses on the
   treated arm were significantly reduced (P = 0.02 and P = 0.04,
   respectively, paired t test) as compared with the untreated arm at 1
   month after four weekly treatments. Despite this pilot study including
   challenging cases of subjects on both inhaled and injected
   corticosteroids and blood thinners, all subjects with senile purpura had
   at least a 50\% reduction in the total square area of their ecchymoses
   on their treated arm. There were no significant or long-lasting side
   effects, and all subjects reported satisfaction with the treatment with
   a desire to continue treatments on their control arm.
   Blinded evaluators were able to select 100\% of the time in the subjects
   with senile purpura, which was the treated arm as compared with the
   control arm when reviewing photographs from 1 month after the last
   treatment. In addition, several subjects were noted to have a
   significant improvement in the appearance of hemosiderin deposition and
   photodamage. Histologically, intense pulsed light treatments
   significantly increased epidermal thickness in elderly subjects by
   21.14\% (P = 0.0153, two-tailed, paired t test), to levels comparable
   with young subjects. Such restoration is consistent with the other
   histological observations by blinded evaluators of more abundant and
   organized collagen fibers in the dermis and reduced aggregates of
   disorganized elastin fibers.
   Conclusion This new intense pulsed light protocol is safe and effective
   in improving the clinical appearance of senile purpura as well as
   preventing future lesions by improving the structure of the skin by
   increasing epidermal thickness and improving collagen and elastic fiber
   morphology. The treatment was well-tolerated, adverse effects were
   minimal, and there was high patient satisfaction. Lasers Surg. Med.

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{When predicting a certain subject-level variable (e.g., age in years)
   from measured biological data (e.g., structural MRI scans), the decoding
   algorithm does not always preserve the distribution of the variable to
   predict. In such a situation, distributional transformation (DT), i.e.,
   mapping the predicted values to the variable's distribution in the
   training data, might improve decoding accuracy. Here, we tested the
   potential of DT within the 2019 Predictive Analytics Competition (PAC)
   which aimed at predicting chronological age of adult human subjects from
   structural MRI data. In a low-dimensional setting, i.e., with less
   features than observations, we applied multiple linear regression,
   support vector regression and deep neural networks for out-of-sample
   prediction of subject age. We found that (i) when the number of features
   is low, no method outperforms linear regression; and (ii) except when
   using deep regression, distributional transformation increases decoding
   performance, reducing the mean absolute error (MAE) by about half a
   year. We conclude that DT can be advantageous when predicting variables
   that are non-controlled, but have an underlying distribution in healthy
   or diseased populations.}},

Abstract = {{Pathological angiogenesis is an important component of hepatic fibrosis
   along with fibrous deposition, but its role is not well understood.
   Here, we demonstrated that fibronectin containing extra domain
   A(FN-EDA), a fibronectin splice variant highly expressed in hepatic
   fibrosis, mediated angiogenesis in disease progression. FN-EDA was
   positively correlated with pathological angiogenesis in hepatic
   fibrosis, and a reduction in FN-EDA expression was associated with
   diminished intrahepatic angiogenesis and fibrosis. FN-EDA mostly
   colocalized with hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and interference or
   blockage of FN-EDA attenuated migration and tube formation in
   co-cultured endothelial cells. Mechanistic studies indicated that FN-EDA
   was secreted to promote phosphorylation of VEGFR2 with the assistance of
   integrin and CD63. Targeting FN-EDA-integrin combination postponed the
   progression of hepatic angiogenesis and fibrosis in vivo. These results
   indicated that FN-EDA plays an emerging role in angiogenesis in hepatic
   fibrosis and could be a potential therapeutic intervention for the
   disease.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid range expansions of invasive species are a major threat to
   ecosystems. Understanding how invasive species increase their habitat
   ranges and how environmental factors, including intensity of human
   activities, influence dispersal processes is an important issue in
   invasion biology, especially for invasive species management. We have
   investigated how spatially heterogeneous factors influence range
   expansion of an invasive species by focusing on long-distance dispersal,
   which is frequently assisted by human activities. We have developed
   models varying two underlying processes of a dispersal event. These
   events are described by source and destination functions that determine
   spatial variations in dispersal frequency and the probability of being a
   dispersal destination. Using these models, we investigated how spatially
   heterogeneous long-distance dispersal influences range expansion. We
   found that: (1) spatial variations in the destination function slow down
   late population dynamics, (2) spatial variations in the source function
   increase the stochasticity of early population dynamics, and (3) the
   speed of early population dynamics changes when both the source and the
   destination functions are spatially heterogeneous and positively
   correlated. These results suggest an importance of spatial heterogeneity
   factors in controlling long-distance dispersal when predicting the
   future spread of invasive species.}},

Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{We present an effective medium description of time-modulated dielectric
   media. By taking the averaged fields over one modulation period, the
   relationship between them is derived, therefore defining the different
   constitutive parameters. In the most general situation, it is found that
   the effective material is described by means of a spatially and
   temporally dispersive transverse dielectric function and a constant
   longitudinal dielectric function. It has been also found that the
   frequency dependence in the former is weak, in comparison with its
   wavenumber dependence (spatial dispersion). Different physical
   consequences of this spatial dispersion are discussed, with special
   emphasis on the weak dispersion approximation and the limit in which it
   is found that the effective material behaves as a resonant and isotropic
   magnetodielectric medium with no additional longitudinal mode, as it is
   commonly found in spatially dispersive materials. Time-dependent media
   therefore opens an alternative way of designing dynamically tunable
   metamaterials.}},

Title = {{Youth empowerment in non-timber forest products (NTFPs) of sub-Saharan
   Africa: the role of corporate social responsibility in Niger Delta,
   Nigeria}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENTERPRISING COMMUNITIES-PEOPLE AND PLACES IN THE GLOBAL
   ECONOMY}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to critically examine the multinational oil
   companies' (MOCs') corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives in
   Nigeria. Its special focus is to investigate the impact of Global
   Memorandum of Understandings (GMOUs) on rural young people involved in
   non-timber forest products (NTFPs) for sustainable livelihood in Niger
   Delta, Nigeria.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Data for this study were collected from primary sources, using
   participatory rural appraisal technique of semi-structured interview
   questionnaire. The use of participatory research techniques in
   collecting CSR impact data especially as it concerns the rural young
   people is because it involves the people being studied, and their views
   on all the issues are paramount. Both descriptive and inferential
   statistics were used to analyse the data. Inferential statistical tool -
   estimation of logit model was used to test the two research hypothesis.
   Findings
   The results indicate that GMoUs have not given adequate attention to
   young people as a special target sub-group who live in rural areas and
   depend mostly on NTFPs. Results also show that a number of factors
   hindering rural young people from the use and development of NTFPs
   include a policy vacuum, non-destructive harvesting, and destruction of
   natural habitats, bushfires, population growths and high demands.
   Research limitations/implications
   The semi-structured interview questionnaire was directly administered by
   the researchers with the help of research assistants. The use of local
   research assistants was because of the inability of the researchers to
   speak the different local languages and dialects of the many ethnic
   groups of Ijaws, Ogonis, Ikweres, Etches, Ekpeyes, Ogbas, Engennes,
   Obolos, Isokos, Nembes, Okirikas, Kalabaris, Urhobos, Iteskiris, Igbos,
   Ika-Igbos, Ndonis, Orons, Ibenos, Yorubas, Ibibios, Anangs, Efiks,
   Bekwarras, Binis, Eshans, Etsakos, Owans, Itigidis, Epies, Akokoedos,
   Yakkurs, etc., in the sampled rural communities.
   Practical implications
   An appropriate GMoU-intervention framework for sustainable promotion of
   NTFPs, domestication of NFTPs, improving harvesting and processing
   techniques are necessary to facilitate good security, reduction of
   poverty and improved livelihoods, particularly for the
   economically-marginalized and forest-dependent rural young people is
   imperative.
   Social implications
   Sustainable livelihoods of the forest-dependent rural young people in
   sub-Saharan Africa would require some focussed CSR interventions on the
   NTFPs for sustainable livelihood. Facilities pertaining to storage,
   grading, processing and value addition through the convergence of
   existing schemes and programmes should be promoted and created. MOCs are
   in a position to empower the rural young people with information about
   the market, policy and products to enable the rural people strategizing
   and accessing returns from NTFPs in sub-Saharan Africa.
   Originality/value
   This research adds to the literature on multinational enterprises' CSR
   initiatives in developing countries and rationale for demands for social
   projects by host communities. It concludes that business has an
   obligation to help in solving problems of sustainable livelihood.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The low number of women in the information technology (IT)
   field is a concern. The purpose of this paper is to examine the factors
   behind the exclusion of girls from the IT field.
   Design/methodology/approach - The present work includes a narrative
   literature review and an exploratory interview study with ten girls and
   six study guidance counsellors (GCs) from Finnish senior high schools.
   Using the nexus analysis as a theoretical lens, the authors examined the
   exclusion of girls from IT.
   Findings - Earlier literature directed attention to the cultural norms,
   assumptions and stereotypes still prevalent in society and the lack of
   role models and positive media as factors contributing to girls
   excluding themselves from the IT field. In this research study's data,
   the authors not only found evidence of the unintentional exclusion of
   girls from IT by others but also by the girls themselves. Findings of
   this research study illustrate the various discourses, actors and their
   interactions, their background and history-related factors affecting
   girls' career choices. The novelty of this study is in approaching high
   school as a site of exclusion, where problematic discourses,
   interactions and histories come together, reproducing exclusion of girls
   from the IT field.
   Originality/value - The authors contribute with a literature review of
   the research study on gender and IT and the inclusion/exclusion dynamics
   around IT. Using the nexus analysis, the authors identify the exclusion
   dynamics in this complex social issue. Several decades of research have
   shown that the inclusion of women remains low in IT disciplines. In this
   study, high schools are viewed as sites of exclusion, engendering a
   prevalent lack of information and education on the field. The authors
   offer novel insights into the role of curriculum, GCs and online
   information excluding girls from the IT field.}},

Abstract = {{Posttraumatic arthritis (PTA) occurs commonly after articular fracture
   and may arise, in part, from joint surface incongruity after injury.
   MRL/MpJ (MRL) ``super-healer{''} mice are protected from PTA compared to
   C57BL/6 (B6) mice following articular fracture. However, the
   relationship between the initial displacement of the articular surface,
   biologic response, and susceptibility to PTA after fracture remains
   unclear. The objective of this study was to assess whether joint
   incongruity after articular fracture, as measured by in vivo
   micro-computed tomography (microCT), could predict pathomechanisms of
   PTA in mice. B6 and MRL mice (n = 12/strain) received a closed articular
   fracture (fx) of the left tibial plateau. Articular incongruity was
   quantified as bone surface deviations (BSD) for each in vivo microCT
   scan obtained from pre-fx to 8 weeks post-fx, followed by histologic
   assessment of arthritis. Serum concentrations of bone formation (PINP)
   and bone resorption (CTX-I) biomarkers were quantified longitudinally.
   Both strains showed increases in surface incongruity over time, as
   measured by increases in BSD. In B6 mice, acute surface incongruity was
   significantly correlated to the severity of PTA (R-2 = 0.988; p =
   .0006), but not in MRL mice (R-2 = 0.224; p = .220). PINP concentrations
   significantly decreased immediately post-fx in B6 mice (p = .023) but
   not in MRL mice, indicating higher bone synthesis in MRL mice. MRL/MpJ
   mice demonstrate a unique biologic response to articular fracture such
   that the observed articular bone surface displacement does not correlate
   with the severity of subsequent PTA. Clinical Relevance: Identifying
   therapies to enhance acute biologic repair following articular fracture
   may mitigate the risk of articular surface displacement for PTA.}},

Abstract = {{Using bilayer CrI3 as an example, we demonstrate that stacking domain
   walls in van der Waals magnets can host one-dimensional (1D) magnon
   channels, which have lower energies than bulk magnons. Interestingly,
   some magnon channels are hidden in magnetically homogeneous background
   and can only be inferred with the knowledge of stacking domain walls.
   Compared to 1D magnons confined in magnetic domain walls, 1D magnons in
   stacking domain walls are more stable against external perturbations. We
   show that the relaxed moire superlattices of small-angle twisted bilayer
   CrI3 is a natural realization of stacking domain walls and host
   interconnected moire magnon network. Our Letter reveals the importance
   of stacking domain walls in understanding magnetic properties of van der

   determined; that is, each compound was confirmed by two ions with a mass
   error below 5\%, and the abundance ratio of the two ions was less than
   30\%. Second, the instrument conditions and sample pretreatment
   conditions for the determination of different compounds were optimized,
   and the influence of different levels of quantitative ions on the matrix
   effect was compared. The following observations were made: ( 1) the
   addition of 0. 1\% formic acid to the water phase improved the response
   of the chromatographic peaks; ( 2) among the various solvent amounts
   tested ( 4, 5, 6, 8 mL acetonitrile and 4, 5, 6, 8 mL methanol), 4 mL
   acetonitrile showed the best extraction efficiency; ( 3) PRiME HLB had a
   better purification effect than the other two purification columns ( C18
   and HLB solid-phase extraction cartridges), thus reducing the
   interference of impurities and ensuring good recovery of the target
   compounds; (4) the use of two pairs of secondary product ion
   quantification could significantly reduce the matrix effect of anti.
   allergic compounds and improve the quantification accuracy. Finally,
   based on the above findings, the experimental procedure was established.
   The lotion samples were first ultrasonically extracted with acetonitrile
   and purified on the PRiME HLB column. Chromatographic separation was
   performed on a Waters XBridge C18 column with gradient elution using 0.
   1\% ( v / v) formic acid in water and acetonitrile. Finally, the
   sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra ( SWATH),
   which shows obvious advantages in continuous and high. throughput
   acquisition, was selected for MS data acquisition. The retention time,
   mass accuracy, isotope distribution, and fragment ion matching ratio
   were used for fast qualitative screening, while the peak areas of
   characteristic productions were used for precise quantification. All the
   calibration curves showed good linearity ( r(2) >0. 99) within the
   tested ranges ( 5-100 mu g / L) under the optimum conditions. The limits
   of quantification ( LOQs) were in the range of 0. 05- 0. 10 mg / kg. The
   recoveries were in the range of 65. 3\% - 107\% at three spiked levels (
   0. 10, 0. 20, and 0. 60 mg / kg), with relative standard deviations (
   RSDs, n = 6) below 20\%. Compared with the existing ion exchange column
   methods, the proposed ``one-step{''} purification method based on PRiME
   HLB is simpler and more rapid, where the extraction solution is filtered
   directly after allowing it to pass through the column, without any
   subsequent washing and elution procedures. In addition, the LOQs of this
   method are lower than those of other LC-MS / MS methods, indicating that
   the proposed method has higher sensitivity. The application of SWATH
   data acquisition makes it possible to achieve quantification with two
   pairs of product ions, thus reducing the matrix effect and ensuring
   accuracy of the quantitative results.
   Therefore, the proposed method is less time. consuming and operationally
   convenient, and it can be used for the rapid screening and accurate
   quantification of antiallergics in lotion samples.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, polyphenols from olive leaves was extracted by
   ultrasound-assisted aqueous two phase extraction (UAATPE). Based on
   single factor experiment and response surface methodology (RSM), the
   optimum extraction conditions of polyphenols contained 29\% (w/w)
   (NH4)(2)SO4, 35\% (w/w) ethanol, pH 6.7, and 45 degrees C. The maximum
   extraction yield of polyphenols and oleuropein content were 34.06 mg/g
   and 44.13 mg/L, respectively. Compared with ultrasound-assisted
   extraction (UAE) and aqueous two phase extraction (ATPE), the extraction
   yield of polyphenols by UAATPE was 9.48 and 61.19\% higher,
   respectively. In addition, the extract of UAATPE had higher purity. The
   results of antioxidant activity showed that polyphenols extracted by
   UAATPE had stronger DPPH and hydroxyl radicals scavenging ability and
   reducing power. Therefore, UAATPE is an efficient method for extracting
   polyphenols from olive leaves.}},

Abstract = {{Ambient concentrations of ice-forming particles measured during ship
   expeditions are collected and summarised with the aim of determining the
   spatial distribution and variability in ice nuclei in oceanic regions.
   The presented data from literature and previously unpublished data from
   over 23 months of ship-based measurements stretch from the Arctic to the
   Southern Ocean and include a circumnavigation of Antarctica. In
   comparison to continental observations, ship-based measurements of
   ambient ice nuclei show 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower mean
   concentrations. To quantify the geographical variability in oceanic
   areas, the concentration range of potential ice nuclei in different
   climate zones is analysed by meridionally dividing the expedition tracks
   into tropical, temperate and polar climate zones. We find that
   concentrations of ice nuclei in these meridional zones follow
   temperature spectra with similar slopes but vary in absolute
   concentration. Typically, the frequency with which specific
   concentrations of ice nuclei are observed at a certain temperature
   follows a log-normal distribution. A consequence of the log-normal
   distribution is that the mean concentration is higher than the most
   frequently measured concentration. Finally, the potential contribution
   of ship exhaust to the measured ice nuclei concentration on board
   research vessels is analysed as function of temperature. We find a sharp
   onset of the influence at approximately -36 degrees C but none at warmer
   temperatures that could bias ship-based measurements.}},

Title = {{Cardiac Autonomic Dysfunction and Incidence of de novo Atrial
   Fibrillation: Heart Rate Variability vs. Heart Rate Complexity}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{Background The REACT DX registry evaluates standard therapies to
   episodes of long-lasting atrial tachyarrhythmias and assesses the
   quality of sensing and stability of the lead and the implantable
   cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) (BIOTRONIK Lumax VR-T DX and
   successors) over at least a 1-year follow-up period. Objective To study
   the association between the risk of de novo device-detected atrial
   fibrillation (AF), the autonomic perturbations before the onset of
   paroxysmal AF and a 7-days heart rate variability (7dHRV) 1 month after
   ICD implantation. Methods The registry consists of 234 patients
   implanted with an ICD, including 10 with de novo long-lasting atrial
   tachyarrhythmias with no prior history of AF. The patients were matched
   via the propensity-score methodology as well as for properties directly
   influencing the ECGs recorded using GE CardioMem CM 3000. Heart rate
   variability (HRV) analysis was performed using standard parameters from
   time- and frequency-domains, and from non-linear dynamics. Results No
   linear HRV was associated with an increased risk of AF (p = n.s.). The
   only significant approach was derived from symbolic dynamics with the
   parameter ``forbidden words{''} which distinguished both groups on all 7
   days of measurements (p < 0.05), thereby quantifying the heart rate
   complexity (HRC) as drastically lower in the de novo AF group.
   Conclusion Cardiac autonomic dysfunction denoted by low HRC may be
   associated with higher AF incidence. For patients with mild to moderate
   heart failure, standard HRV parameters are not appropriate to quantify
   cardiac autonomic perturbations before the onset of AF. Further studies
   are needed to determine the individual risk for AF that would enable
   interventions to restore autonomic balance in the general population.}},

Abstract = {{Objective This study aims to investigate the variations in publicly
   available nasal irrigation recipes published in the United Kingdom (UK).
   Design Internet searches used to identify eligible nasal irrigation
   recipes. These were then examined for their physical and biochemical
   properties, through theoretical calculations and experimental
   measurement.
   Setting Recipes produced by healthcare providers or official national
   bodies in the UK.
   Participants No human participants.
   Main outcome measures Solution osmolality (classified into hypo-, iso-
   and hypertonic), acidity (pH) and specific gravity.
   Results Thirteen unique recipes were identified from 17 sources.
   Osmolality ranged from 166.2 to 1492.2 mosmol/kg in volumes ranging from
   142 to 1136 mLs (isotonic range 275-295 mosmol/kg). Specific gravity
   ranged from 1.006 to 1.034. pH ranged from 7.74 to 8.11. No recipe
   produced a solution with isotonic properties. The majority produced
   hypertonic irrigations.
   Conclusions Most publicly available nasal irrigation recipes produce
   hypertonic solutions but there is great variability in the osmolality
   and volume. UK organisations should take action to review published
   recipes to bring these into alignment with latest guidelines
   (recommending against hypertonic saline use) and reduce variability in
   patient interpretations.}},

Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{57}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Most of the theories that have dominated supply chain management (SCM)
   take a reductionist and static view on the supply chain and its
   management, promoting a global hunt for cheap labor and resources. As a
   result, supply chains tend to be operated without much concern for their
   broader contextual environment. This perspective overlooks that supply
   chains have become both vulnerable and harmful systems. Recent and
   ongoing crises have emphasized that the structures and processes of
   supply chains are fluid and interwoven with political-economic and
   planetary phenomena. Building on panarchy theory, this article
   reinterprets the supply chain as a social-ecological system and leaves
   behind a modernist view of SCM, replacing it with a more contemporary
   vision of ``dancing the supply chain.{''} A panarchy is a structure of
   adaptive cycles that are linked across different levels on scales of
   time, space, and meaning. It represents the world's complexities more
   effectively than reductionist and static theories ever could, providing
   the basis for transformative SCM.}},

Abstract = {{In a regression setting, it is often of interest to quantify the
   importance of various features in predicting the response. Commonly, the
   variable importance measure used is determined by the regression
   technique employed. For this reason, practitioners often only resort to
   one of a few regression techniques for which a variable importance
   measure is naturally defined. Unfortunately, these regression techniques
   are often suboptimal for predicting the response. Additionally, because
   the variable importance measures native to different regression
   techniques generally have a different interpretation, comparisons across
   techniques can be difficult. In this work, we study a variable
   importance measure that can be used with any regression technique, and
   whose interpretation is agnostic to the technique used. This measure is
   a property of the true data-generating mechanism. Specifically, we
   discuss a generalization of the analysis of variance variable importance
   measure and discuss how it facilitates the use of machine learning
   techniques to flexibly estimate the variable importance of a single
   feature or group of features. The importance of each feature or group of
   features in the data can then be described individually, using this
   measure. We describe how to construct an efficient estimator of this
   measure as well as a valid confidence interval. Through simulations, we
   show that our proposal has good practical operating characteristics, and
   we illustrate its use with data from a study of risk factors for
   cardiovascular disease in South Africa.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{125}},

Abstract = {{Using quantum walks (QWs) to rank the centrality of nodes in networks,
   represented by graphs, is advantageous compared to certain widely used
   classical algorithms. However, it is challenging to implement a directed
   graph via QW, since it corresponds to a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and
   thus cannot be accomplished by conventional QW. Here we report the
   realizations of centrality rankings of a three-, a four-, and a
   nine-vertex directed graph with parity-time (PT) symmetric quantum walks
   by using high-dimensional photonic quantum states, multiple concatenated
   interferometers, and dimension dependent loss to achieve these. We
   demonstrate the advantage of the QW approach experimentally by breaking
   the vertex rank degeneracy in a four-vertex graph. Furthermore, we
   extend our experiment from single-photon to two-photon Fock states as
   inputs and realize the centrality ranking of a nine-vertex graph. Our
   work shows that a PT symmetric multiphoton quantum walk paves the way
   for realizing advanced algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{As a commonly used image format, JPEG image is popularly used as the

   applies it to the non-zero alternating current (AC) coefficients of JPEG
   images. Besides, a block and coefficient selection strategy is utilised
   to further improve the image quality and suppress the increase of file
   size. More specifically, the smooth discrete cosine transform (DCT)
   blocks with fewer zero AC coefficients are preferentially selected to
   embed data. The experiments indicate that our scheme achieves a high
   embedding capacity, meanwhile, the stego-image quality keeps good and
   the file size preserves well, moreover, our scheme is superior to the
   state-of-the-art scheme.}},

Abstract = {{The J-aggregation of dye-functional group conjugates, which results in
   intriguing photophysical properties and highly ordered structures, has
   several advantages over that of monomeric dyes and exhibits augmented
   performance compared to that of monomeric functional groups, thereby
   providing a novel platform for devising materials with advanced
   functions. Herein, it is reported that a molecularly engineered nanodisc
   by the antiparallel J-aggregation of halogenated BODIPY-Gd(III), a
   dye-functional group conjugate. The highly directional halogen-bonding
   interactions enable a unique antiparallel J-stacking of BODIPY-Gd(III),
   resulting in an alternating, orderly arrangement of the functional
   Gd(III) groups on the surfaces of the nanodisc, and allowing water
   stability and an enhanced magnetic resonance signal. Moreover, the
   J-stacked dyes render the nanodisc with excellent photothermal
   performance, such as intense NIR-absorptivity, high photothermal
   conversion efficiency, and a nearly non-photobleaching capability.
   Preliminary in vivo studies demonstrated the potential of the nanodisc
   as an efficient bimodal photoacoustic and high-performing magnetic
   resonance imaging, and antitumor photothermal therapy agent. This
   conceptual work not only establishes a general strategy for
   nano-J-aggregates with desired dye arrangement, controlled size, and in
   vivo stability, but also advances the antiparallel J-aggregation of
   dye-functional group conjugates as a potential platform for
   multifunctional integration and modulation, wherein multiple functional
   groups and BODIPYs can be installed.}},

Abstract = {{Global environmental change poses threats to plant and soil
   biodiversity. Yet, whether soil biodiversity loss can further influence
   plant community's response to global change is still poorly understood.
   We created a gradient of soil biodiversity using the
   dilution-to-extinction approach, and investigated the effects of soil
   biodiversity loss on plant communities during and following
   manipulations simulating global change disturbances in experimental
   grassland microcosms.
   Grass and herb biomass was decreased by drought and promoted by nitrogen
   deposition, and a fast recovery was observed following disturbances,
   independently of soil biodiversity loss. Warming promoted herb biomass
   during and following disturbance only when soil biodiversity was not
   reduced. However, legumes biomass was suppressed by these disturbances,
   and there were more detrimental effects with reduced soil biodiversity.
   Moreover, soil biodiversity loss suppressed the recovery of legumes
   following these disturbances. Similar patterns were found for the
   response of plant diversity. The changes in legumes might be partly
   attributed to the loss of mycorrhizal soil mutualists.
   Our study shows that soil biodiversity is crucial for legume persistence
   and plant diversity maintenance when faced with environmental change,
   highlighting the importance of soil biodiversity as a potential
   buffering mechanism for plant diversity and community composition in
   grasslands.}},

Title = {{Heart Rate Variability and Prognosis in Hemodialysis Patients: A
   Meta-Analysis}},
Journal = {{BLOOD PURIFICATION}},
Abstract = {{Background: Heart rate variability (HRV) means the variation in time of
   beat-to-beat interval. Lower HRV has been shown to be related with death
   and cardiovascular events in previous studies. In the last few years,
   the number of patients with ESRD has increased steadily. Maintenance
   hemodialysis is the most prevalent renal replacement therapy in patients
   with ESRD. This study aims to investigate if decreased HRV is an
   independent predictor of mortality in maintenance hemodialysis patients.
   Methods: Pubmed/Medline, EMBASE, Ovid, the Web of Science, and the
   Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched
   up to October 1, 2019, for full-text articles in English. Cohort studies
   reporting the association between HRV and prognosis in hemodialysis
   patients were selected. Data extraction was performed by 2 reviewers
   independently, with adjudication by a third reviewer. Extracted data
   included the study characteristics, HRV measurement and research
   outcomes. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence interval (CI) were
   pooled in a random-effects model for outcomes of all-cause and
   cardiovascular mortality. Heterogeneity assessment, subgroup analyses,
   and sensitivity analysis were conducted. Results: A total of 7 studies
   were eligible. HRV metrics consist of SDNN, SDANN, RMSSD, pNN50, HRVTI,
   ULF, VLF, LF, HF, LF/HF ratio, HRT, DC, and scaling exponents alpha 1
   and alpha 2. Decreased HRV was associated with higher all-cause
   mortality (HR: 1.63, 95\% CI: 1.11-2.39, p = 0.014) and cardiovascular
   mortality (HR: 1.07, 95\% CI: 1.00-1.15, p = 0.045). Among the different
   HRV metrics, decreased SDANN (p < 0.001) and decreased LF/HF ratio (p =
   0.001) were identified as predictors of all-cause death. Decreased SDNN,
   SDANN, and LF/HF ratio were identified as predictors of cardiovascular
   death (p = 0.004, p = 0.001, and p = 0.002). Conclusions: Decreased HRV
   is associated with higher risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death in
   the hemodialysis population. Decreased SDANN and LF/HF were identified
   as predictors of both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, while the
   utility of other HRV metrics requires further investigation. The
   protocol for this study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019141886).}},

Abstract = {{Background: Abdominal obesity has been shown to be a superior measure
   over overall obesity for detecting cardiovascular risk.
   Objective: We conducted this study to compare the effects of overall and
   abdominal obesity on venous thromboembolism (VTE) and to calculate
   population attributable fraction for obesity for VTE.
   Methods: Body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) were used to
   represent overall and abdominal obesity, respectively. In the cohort
   study, we included 74317 Swedish adults with anthropometric measures in
   1997 and of whom 4332 were diagnosed with VTE until the end of 2017. A
   Mendelian randomization study was conducted to investigate causal
   associations of BMI, WC, and WC adjusted for BMI with VTE using data
   from FinnGen and UK Biobank study. Population attributable fraction was
   calculated for overall and abdominal obesity for VTE.
   Results: In the cohort study, there were dose-response associations of
   BMI and WC with VTE. The association between BMI and VTE was attenuated
   largely after adjusting for WC. Among individuals with normal BMI,
   participants with substantially increased WC had 53\% higher (hazard
   ratio 1.53; 95\% confidence interval, 1.28, 1.81) risk of VTE compared
   to those with normal WC. The causality of the association of WC adjusted
   for BMI with VTE was confirmed in Mendelian randomization analysis. The
   estimated population-attributable risk due to elevated BMI and WC were
   12.4\% (8.4\%, 16.5\%) and 23.7\% (18.1\%, 29.4\%), respectively.
   Conclusions: WC might be a preferable indicator linking obesity to VTE.
   A large proportion of VTE cases can be prevented if the population
   maintained a healthy BMI and WC.}},

Title = {{Study on Simplified Model and Numerical Solution of High-Speed Angular
   Contact Ball Bearing}},
Journal = {{SHOCK AND VIBRATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{For the calculation model of high-speed angular contact bearing has many
   variables, the large root difference exists, and the Newton iterative
   method solving the convergence depends on the initial value problems;
   thus, the simplified calculation model is proposed and the algorithm is
   improved. Firstly, based on the nonlinear equations of variables
   recurrence method of the high-speed angular contact ball bearing
   calculation model, it is proved that the ultimate fundamental variables
   of calculation model are the actual inner and outer contact angles, the
   axial and radial deformations. According to this reason, the nonlinear
   equations are deformed and deduced, and the number of equations is
   reduced from 4Z + 2 to 2Z + 2 (Z represents the number of rolling
   bodies); a simplified calculation model is formed. Secondly, according
   to the small dependence of the artificial bee colony algorithm on the
   initial value, an improved artificial bee colony algorithm is proposed
   for the large root difference characteristics of high-speed ball
   bearings. The validity of the improved algorithm is verified by standard
   test function. The algorithm is used to solve the high-speed angular
   contact ball bearing calculation model. Finally, the deformations of
   high-speed angular contact ball bearings are compared and verified by
   experiments, and the results of improved algorithm show good agreement
   with the experiments results.}},

Abstract = {{Genome-wide epistasis analysis is a powerful tool to infer gene
   interactions, which can guide drug and vaccine development and lead to
   deeper understanding of microbial pathogenesis. We have considered all
   complete severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
   genomes deposited in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data
   (GISAID) repository until four different cutoff dates, and used direct
   coupling analysis together with an assumption of quasi-linkage
   equilibrium to infer epistatic contributions to fitness from polymorphic
   loci. We find eight interactions, of which three are between pairs where
   one locus lies in gene ORF3a, both loci holding nonsynonymous mutations.
   We also find interactions between two loci in gene nsp13, both holding
   nonsynonymous mutations, and four interactions involving one locus
   holding a synonymous mutation. Altogether, we infer interactions between
   loci in viral genes ORF3a and nsp2, nsp12, and nsp6, between ORF8 and
   nsp4, and between loci in genes nsp2, nsp13, and nsp14. The paper opens
   the prospect to use prominent epistatically linked pairs as a starting
   point to search for combinatorial weaknesses of recombinant viral
   pathogens.}},

Title = {{Evaluation and Analysis of Soil Temperature Data over Poyang Lake Basin,
   China}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{Soil temperature reflects the impact of local factors, such as the
   vegetation, soil, and atmosphere of a region. Therefore, it is important
   to understand the regional variation of soil temperature. However, given
   the lack of observations with adequate spatial and/or temporal coverage,
   it is often difficult to use observational data to study the regional
   variation. Based on the observational data from Nanchang and Ganzhou
   stations and ERA-Interim/Land reanalysis data, this study analyzed the
   spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of soil temperature over
   Poyang Lake Basin. Four soil depths were examined, 0-7, 7-28, 28-100,
   and 100-289 cm, recorded as ST1, ST2, ST3, and ST4, respectively. The
   results showed close correlations between observation data and
   reanalysis data at different depths. Reanalysis data could reproduce the
   main spatiotemporal distributions of soil temperature over the Poyang
   Lake Basin but generally underestimated their magnitudes. Temporally,
   there was a clear warming trend in the basin. Seasonally, the
   temperature increase was the most rapid in spring and the slowest in
   summer, except for ST4, which increased the fastest in spring and the
   slowest in winter. The temperature increase was faster for ST1 than the
   other depths. The warming trend was almost the same for ST2, ST3, and
   ST4. An abrupt change of annual soil temperature at all depths occurred
   in 1997, and annual soil temperatures at all depths were abnormally low
   in 1984. Spatially, annual soil temperature decreased with latitude,
   except for the summer ST1. Because of the high temperature and
   precipitation in summer, the ST1 values were higher around the lake and
   the river. The climatic trend of soil temperature generally increased
   from south to north, which was opposite to the distribution of soil
   temperature. These findings provide a basis for understanding and
   assessing the variation of soil temperature in the Poyang Lake Basin.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: The pharmacokinetics (PK) of teicoplanin differs in children
   compared with adults. Our aim was to determine the PK of teicoplanin in
   an Asian pediatric population and to optimize dosage regimens.
   Methods: This was a retrospective PK study and all the data were
   collected from hospitalized children. We developed a population PK model
   using sparse data, and Monte Carlo simulation was used to assess the
   ability of standard teicoplanin regimen and other different dosage
   regimens. The optimal dosing regimens were defined as achieving the
   target trough concentration (C (min)) of 10 mg/L and
   pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD, {[}AUC(24)/MIC]) of 125 for
   moderate infection. For severe infection, the optimal dosing regimens
   were defined as achieving the target 15 mg/L and AUC(24)/MIC of 345.
   Results: 159 children were included and 1.5 samples/children on average
   were provided. Estimated clearance of teicoplanin was 0.694 L/h
   (0.784/L/h/70 kg) and volume of distribution was 1.39 L. Teicoplanin
   standard loading dose was adequate for moderate infection, while 13
   mg/kg was needed for severer infection. With standard maintenance doses,
   both patients with moderate and severe infection failed to achieve the
   target C (min). 12 and 16 mg/kg/day were required to achieve a C (min)
   >= 10 and 15 mg/L, respectively. However, standard maintenance dose was
   adequate to achieve AUC(24)/MIC >= 125 for moderate infection, and 12
   mg/kg/day was needed to achieve AUC(24)/MIC >= 345 for severe infection.
   Lower weight and serum creatinine were associated with higher dose.
   Conclusion: Optimal doses based on the target C (min) were higher than
   that based on the PK/PD target. To achieve the C (min) and PK/PD targets
   simultaneously, a standard loading dose was adequate for moderate
   infection based on simulation, while dosing higher than standard doses
   were required in other situation. Further clinical studies with rich
   sampling from children is required to confirm our findings.}},

Abstract = {{Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a heme peroxidase that plays an important role
   in innate immunity for host defense against invading microorganisms by
   catalyzing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-mediated reactions. Although many
   reports indicate MPO exerts beneficial or detrimental effects on a
   variety of inflammatory diseases, little is known with regard to its
   functional role in bone homeostasis in vivo. Here, our work demonstrates
   that MPO was transcriptionally downregulated in response to
   osteoclastogenic stimuli and that exogenous alteration of MPO expression
   negatively regulated osteoclast (OC) differentiation in vitro. Genetic
   ablation of Mpo resulted in osteoporotic phenotypes and potentiated
   bone-resorptive capacity in mice. Mechanistically, accumulation of
   intracellular H2O2 and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were observed in
   MPO deficiency, and MPO overexpression suppressed ROS production in
   mouse OC precursors. Moreover, a ROS scavenger Tempol inhibited the
   effect of MPO deficiency on OC formation and function as well as on
   receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL)-initiated
   transduction signal activation including NF-kappa B, mitogen-activated
   protein kinases (MAPKs), and Akt, indicating the increased ROS caused by
   MPO deficiency contributes to osteoclastogenesis. Taken together, our
   data demonstrate that MPO has a protective role in bone turnover by
   limiting osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption physiologically through
   modulating intracellular H2O2 level. (c) 2020 The Authors. Journal of

Abstract = {{In this study, three skimmed and one whole-fat spray-dried camel milk
   powders were produced and their characteristics were compared to those
   of bovine milk powders. The physicochemical analysis of the produced
   powders indicated that camel milk powders (whether skimmed or not)
   presented higher ash and whey protein contents as compared to those of
   bovine milk powders. Our results indicated that the investigated camel
   and bovine milk powders exhibited a high solubility index (>99\%) with
   poor dispersibility and wettability indexes due to their small particles
   size (d(50) <= 12 mu m) and their narrow size distribution (span <= 2).
   In addition, although camel and bovine milk powders presented the same
   total fat content, lower free fat content was measured for camel milk
   powders. Besides, the whey protein nitrogen index and the SDS-PAGE
   electrophoresis underlined that camel and bovine milk proteins remained
   intact after drying with low denaturation extent. It is worth noticed
   that camel milk proteins were less denaturized due to the absence of the
   heat-sensitive beta-lactoglobulin in camel milk. Moreover, the low
   denaturation extent participated in the enhancing of the foaming
   capacity and stability of camel and bovine milk powders. Finally, the
   calorimetric analysis showed that higher fat melting temperatures were
   recorded in whole-fat camel milk powder and in their anhydrous form as
   compared to those of bovine milk.
   Practical Application Camel milk powder is an emerging non-bovine dairy
   product. Understanding its rehydration ability and evaluating the impact
   of spray drying on its protein quality are promising approaches to
   obtain high-quality camel milk powder with high reconstitution ability.
   Findings of this study indicated that spray drying is a suitable
   technique to produce highly soluble camel milk powders with low
   denaturation extent. These results will benefit the research and
   development department of food industry (especially those producing
   camel milk powder) as well as the direct consumers.}},

Abstract = {{The invariant differential cross section of inclusive omega (782) meson
   production at midrapidity (|y|<0.5) in pp collisions at s=7 TeV was
   measured with the ALICE detector at the LHC over a transverse momentum
   range of 2<pT<17 GeV/c. The omega meson was reconstructed via its omega
   -> pi+pi-pi 0 decay channel. The measured omega production cross section
   is compared to various calculations: PYTHIA 8.2 Monash 2013 describes
   the data, while PYTHIA 8.2 Tune 4C overestimates the data by about 50\%.
   A recent NLO calculation, which includes a model describing the
   fragmentation of the whole vector-meson nonet, describes the data within
   uncertainties below 6 GeV/c, while it overestimates the data by up to
   50\% for higher pT. The omega/pi 0 ratio is in agreement with previous
   measurements at lower collision energies and the PYTHIA calculations. In
   addition, the measurement is compatible with transverse mass scaling
   within the measured pT range and the ratio is constant with C omega/pi
   0=0.67 +/- 0.03(stat) +/- 0.04(sys) above a transverse momentum of 2.5
   GeV/c.}},

Abstract = {{Since the production of ferromagnetic graphene as an extremely important
   matter in spintronics has made a revolution in future technology, a
   great deal of efforts has recently been done to reach a simple and
   cost-effective method. Up to now, controlling the magnetic properties at
   extremely low temperature have been investigated only by adding and
   removing atoms in graphene lattice. In this regard, the effect of strain
   on the magnetic and electronic properties of graphene has been probed.
   Here, the ferromagnetic properties are what have been created by strain,
   magnetic field, and temperature along with observation of the parallel
   magnetic domains in ferromagnetic graphene for the first time as a great
   achievement. In this way, we have represented the following: First,
   introducing three novel methods based on temperature, magnetic field,
   and strain for producing ferromagnetic graphene; Second, obtaining
   ferromagnetic graphene at room temperature by significant magnetization
   saturation in mass-scale; Third, probing the electronic systems and
   vibrational modes by Raman and IR spectroscopy; Fourth, introducing
   stacking and aggregation as two types of gathering process for graphene
   sheets; Fifth, comparing the results with leidenfrost effect-based
   method which the temperature, magnetic fields, and strain are
   simultaneously applied to graphene flakes (our previous work).}},

Title = {{Global trends in the performance of large wind farms based on
   high-fidelity simulations}},
Journal = {{WIND ENERGY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1689-1703}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{A total of 18 high-fidelity simulations of large wind farms have been
   performed by three different institutions using various inflow
   conditions and simulation setups. The setups differ in how the
   atmospheric turbulence, wind shear and wind turbine rotors are modeled,
   encompassing a wide range of commonly used modeling methods within the
   large eddy simulation (LES) framework. Various turbine spacings,
   atmospheric turbulence intensity levels and incoming wind velocities are
   considered. The work performed is part of the International Energy
   Agency (IEA) wind task Wakebench and is a continuation of previously
   published results on the subject. This work aims at providing a
   methodology for studying the general flow behavior in large wind farms
   in a systematic way. It seeks to investigate and further understand the
   global trends in wind farm performance, with a focus on variability.
   Parametric studies first map the effect of various parameters on large
   aligned wind farms, including wind turbine spacing, wind shear and
   atmospheric turbulence intensity. The results are then aggregated and
   compared to engineering models as well as LES results from other
   investigations to provide an overall picture of how much power can be
   extracted from large wind farms operating below the rated level. The
   simple engineering models, although they cannot capture the variability
   features, capture the general trends well. Response surfaces are
   constructed based on the large number of aggregated LES data
   corresponding to a wide range of large wind farm layouts. The response
   surfaces form a basis for mapping the inherently varying power
   characteristics inside very large wind farms, including how much the
   turbines are able to exploit the turbulent fluctuations within the wind
   farms and estimating the associated uncertainty, which is valuable
   information useful for risk mitigation.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   The purpose of this research is to ascertain the impact of audit
   committee (AC) activism and independence on the quality and quantity of
   environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosures for energy sector
   firms in Australia. This paper aims to understand how AC attributes such
   as meeting frequency, and the number of independent directors influence
   the compliance with the global reporting initiative (GRI) guidelines and
   quantity of ESG disclosures.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Bloomberg ESG disclosure scores and company reported AC attributes are
   collected and analysed using the pooled ordinary least square (OLS)
   regression framework with Petersen's (2009) technique by using a
   two-dimensional cluster at the firm and year level. Further, this paper
   uses a lagged independent variable and two-stage least square approach
   to address endogeneity concerns.
   Findings
   The results show a significant positive effect of AC activism and
   independence on the level of compliance with the GRI guidelines,
   indicating the favourable effect of AC attributes on ESG reporting
   quality. Likewise, AC attributes positively affect the quantity of ESG
   disclosures. Notably, the impact of AC attributes is more pronounced on
   environmental disclosures.
   Originality/value
   This paper validates the significance of the management control
   mechanism in improving the quality and quantity of ESG disclosures for
   an environmentally sensitive sector, hence offering a potential answer
   to reduce agency and legitimacy issues for the sensitive industry firms.}},

Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{23}},
Pages = {{8323-8336}},

Abstract = {{Sophorolipids are one of the most important microbial biosurfactants,
   because of their large-scale production and applications developed so
   far in the fields of detergency, microbiology, cosmetics or
   environmental science. However, the structural variety of native
   sophorolipids is limited/restricted, a limiting fact for the development
   of new properties and their potential applications. In their open acidic
   form, C18:1 sophorolipids (SL) are classically composed of a sophorose
   headgroup and a carboxylic acid (COOH) end-group. The carboxyl group
   gives them unique pH-responsive properties, but it is a poorly reactive
   group and its charge can only be negative. To develop a new generation
   of pH-responsive, positively charged, SL and to improve their reactivity
   for further functionalization, we develop here SL with an amine (-NH2)
   or terminal alkyne (-CCH) end-group analogues. The amine group generates
   positively charged SL and is more reactive than carboxylic acids, e.g.
   towards aldehydes; the alkyne group provides access to copper-based
   click chemistry. In this work, we synthesized (C18:1) and (C18:0) -NH2
   and (C18:1) -CCH sophorolipid derivatives and we study their
   self-assembly properties in response to pH and/or temperature changes by
   means of static and dynamic light scattering, small angle (X-ray,
   neutron) scattering and cryogenic electron microscopy. Monounsaturated
   aminyl SL-C18:1-NH2 sophorolipids form a micellar phase in their neutral
   form at high pH and a mixed micellar-bilayer phase in their positively
   charged form at low pH. Saturated aminyl SL-C18:0-NH2 sophorolipids form
   a micellar phase in their charged form at low pH and a twisted ribbon
   phase in their neutral form at high pH and monounsaturated alkynyl
   SL-C18:1-CCH sophorolipids form a main micellar phase at T > 51.8
   degrees C and a twisted ribbon phase at T < 51.8 degrees C.}},

Title = {{Synthesis of solvent-free acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesives via
   visible-light-driven photocatalytic radical polymerization without
   additives}},
Journal = {{GREEN CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{Research on solvent-free acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) has
   tremendously grown over the last few decades due to the stringent
   regulations to control volatile organic compound emissions. They are
   mostly prepared in the presence of photoinitiators using high-energy UV
   light that causes several issues such as those associated with radiation
   safety. Herein, for the first time, solvent-free acrylic PSAs were
   prepared through visible-light-driven photocatalytic free radical
   polymerization. Importantly, we found that the use of N-vinyl-based
   monomers noticeably enhances the rate and conversion of polymerizations,
   thereby eliminating the need for additives (e.g. alpha-haloester and
   sacrificial electron donor) that are usually required for
   photoredox-mediated free radical polymerization, but concurrently needs
   an additional purification process to remove residues. Combined
   experiments and quantum chemical calculations suggest that N-vinyl-based
   monomers facilitate electron transfer between monomers and

Abstract = {{Crystallographic and electronic structures of phase pure ternary solid
   solutions of Ni1-xCoxO (x = 0 to 1) have been studied using XRD, EXAFS
   and XAS measurements. The lattice parameter of the cubic rock-salt (RS)
   Ni1-xCoxO solid solutions increases linearly with increasing Co content
   and follows Vegard's law, in the complete composition range. A linear
   increase in the bond lengths (Ni/Co-O, Ni-Ni and Ni-Co) with ``x{''},
   closely following the bond lengths determined from virtual crystal
   approximation (VCA), is observed, which implies that there is only a
   minimal local distortion of the lattice in the mixed crystal. The
   optical gap of the ternary solid solution determined from diffuse
   reflectivity measurements shows neither a linear variation with Co
   composition nor bowing, as observed in many ternary semiconductors. This
   trend in the variation of optical gaps is explained by probing the
   conduction band using XAS at the O K-edge. We have observed that the
   variation in the onset energy of the conduction band edge with ``x{''}
   is very similar to the variation in the optical gap with ``x{''}, thus
   clearly indicating the dominant role played by the conduction band
   position in determining the optical gap. The variation in the
   intensities of the pre-edge peak in the XANES spectra measured at Ni and
   Co K-edges, and the L-1/2 peak in XAS spectra measured at Ni and Co
   L-edges, is found to depend on the unoccupied O 2p-metal-(Ni/Co) 3d
   hybridized states and the bond lengths.}},

   Me3N yields the corresponding amine-coordinated silyl aluminum complexes
   (R3Si)ALX(2)center dot NMe3, (R3Si)(2)-AlX center dot NMe3, and
   (R3Si)(3)Al center dot NMe3. An intramolecular amine-coordinated

   thermal stability than the analogous etherate complexes and are
   reasonably volatile (100-140 degrees C, 0.2 Torr). The materials

Journal = {{PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to compare various multisource
   configurations applied to cone beam CT (CBCT) using phantom imaging and
   Monte Carlo simulations. Image quality, scatter, and dose were evaluated
   in both overlapping (large cone angle) and collimated (small cone angle)
   configurations for CBCT. Four x-ray tube configurations were considered:
   traditional one source, three source overlapping, six source
   overlapping, and six source collimated. Image quality was evaluated on a
   prototype breast CT system using the following five phantoms: a Defrise
   phantom, a previously reported CBCT QA phantom (Corgi), a polyethylene
   cylinder, and two anthropomorphic phantoms (hand and knee). Scatter
   contamination and radiation dose were evaluated using Monte Carlo
   simulations of a voxelized polyethylene cylinder. The modulation of the
   Defrise phantom disks on average was 2.7X greater for the six source
   collimated configuration than the six source overlapping configuration.
   The data lost from cone beam artifact (spatial domain) and the null cone
   (frequency domain) in the overlapping configuration were completely
   recovered using the collimated configuration. The maximum
   scatter-to-primary ratio (SPR) for the overlapping configuration was
   0.81 and the maximum SPR for the collimated configuration was 0.26. The
   average dose and maximum dose was 4X less in the collimated six source
   configuration when compared with the overlapping configurations. The
   maximum dose for the overlapping configurations (one, three \& six)
   remained constant, but the average dose for the multisource (three \&
   six source) overlapping configurations increased 25\% when compared to
   the one source configuration. Use of a collimated multisource x-ray tube
   configuration was shown to provide significant improvements in image
   quality throughout the cone-beam geometry field-of-view, reduction in
   scatter contamination, and more efficient use of dose in comparison to
   both the traditional CBCT geometry with a single source and the
   overlapping multisource configurations.}},

   Likely Supplements Essential Fatty Acids}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{Detritus is a frequent, poorly defined, component of bivalve growth and
   carrying capacity models. The purpose of this study was to determine the
   proportional contributions of detrital material derived from primary
   producers (phytoplankton, macroalgae, Spartina alterniflora, and
   terrestrial leaf litter) to particulate organic matter (POM) and blue
   mussel's (Mytilus edulis) diet within a temperate bay (Saco Bay, ME,
   United States). We assessed which detrital sources, if any, warranted
   incorporation into modeling efforts. Stable isotopes (delta C-13 and
   delta N-15) and fatty acid biomarkers (FA) of mussels, size fractionated
   (<100 mu m) POM, and primary producer endmembers (phytoplankton,
   Saccharina latissima, Ascophyllum nodosum, Chondrus crispus, Spartina
   alterniflora and leaf litter) collected between 2016 and 2017 were used
   to estimate endmember contributions to POM and mussel diets. Based on
   FAs dinoflagellates were the most abundant phytoplankton in Saco Bay,
   even during the fall diatom bloom. Diatoms within the bay were primarily
   centric, but pennate diatoms were at times present in the water column
   (e.g., in September). Following abundances of dinoflagellates, and
   centric and pennate diatoms, 22:6 omega 3 (DHA) was the most abundant
   essential FA (8.6 +/- 0.1\% total FAs), followed by 20:5 omega 3 (EPA:
   7.0 +/- 0.1\%) and 20:4 omega 6 (ARA: 0.3 +/- 0.1\%). On average,
   phytoplankton derived organic matter contributed 22.1 +/- 0.3\% of the
   total POM in the bay. The concentration of non-fresh phytoplankton
   organic matter, or remaining organic matter (REMORG), was positively
   correlated with all endmember biomarkers. However, the proportion (\%)
   of vascular plant, macroalgal, and detrital FAs was negatively
   correlated with the concentration of REMORG. This finding suggests in
   periods of low productivity, vascular plant and macroalgal detritus are
   proportionally more important contributors to POM. Mussels were broad
   spectrum omnivores, consuming phytoplankton, zooplankton, and detrital
   material. Detrital contributions to mussel diets were important (minimum
   of 16\% of diet). Although small, macroalgae's dietary contribution
   (8\%) to M. edulis may be important. Macroalgal detritus contained
   essential FAs (20:5 omega 3 and 20:4 omega 6) that could supplement
   mussel diets, as M. edulis in Saco Bay were likely limited by 20:5 omega
   3. Consideration of how macroalgal detritus affects the availability of
   essential FAs in POM may be useful to incorporate into aquaculture site
   selection.}},

Abstract = {{Approximately 32 million people have died of HIV infection since the
   beginning of the outbreak, and 38 million are currently infected. Among
   strategies adopted by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS to
   end the AIDS global epidemic, the treatment, diagnosis, and viral
   suppression of the infected subjects are considered crucial for HIV
   prevention and transmission. Although several antiretroviral (ARV) drugs
   are successfully used to manage HIV infection, their efficacy strictly
   relies on perfect adherence to the therapy, which is seldom achieved.
   Patient supervision, especially in HIV-endemic, low-resource settings,
   requires rapid, easy-to-use, and affordable analytical tools, such as
   the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and especially the lateral
   flow immunoassay (LFIA). In this work, high-affinity monoclonal
   antibodies were generated to develop ELISA and LFIA prototypes for
   monitoring tenofovir (TFV), an ARV drug present in several HIV
   treatments. TFV was functionalized by inserting a carboxylated C5-linker
   at the phosphonic group of the molecule, and the synthetic derivative
   was conjugated to proteins for mice immunization. Through a rigorous
   screening strategy of hybridoma supernatants, a panel of monoclonal
   antibodies strongly binding to TFV was obtained. Following antibody
   characterization for affinity and selectivity by competitive ELISA, a
   LFIA prototype was developed and tentatively applied to determine TFV in
   simulated urine. The point-of-care test showed ultra-high detectability
   (the visual limit of detection was 2.5 nM, 1.4 ng mL(-1)), excellent
   selectivity, and limited proneness to matrix interference, thus
   potentially making this rapid method a valuable tool for the on-site
   assessment of patient adherence to ARV therapy.}},

Title = {{Reduction of Management Costs and Avoidance of Air Release of

Abstract = {{Hospital waste management is a current sustainability challenge.
   Although not always performed, the most applied approach in current
   protocols is the proper segregation of waste. The incineration of
   hospital waste is an significant source of emission of specific toxic
   particles and gases. We highlighted dioxins, whose representatives have
   been considered carcinogenic agents since 1994. Several experimental and
   epidemiologic studies have shown greater cancer morbidity and mortality
   associated with dioxin exposure. In the present study, we presented the
   impact of a hospital waste management program implemented in an oncology
   institution based on proper segregation and consequent reduction of
   incinerated mass. Data were collected for 8 years and the waste was
   separated into five categories: infectious (A4), chemical (B),
   recyclable (DR), non-recyclable (DNR), and sharps (E). The classes
   addressed to incineration were A4, B, and E. A team education starting
   from the admission process and with a continued education program was
   essential for a successfully implemented program. We achieved a 66\%
   saving of waste from incineration, equivalent to 76 tons, of which 71.9
   tons corresponded to recyclable waste. If the waste separation protocol
   was not implemented, the biohazardous and chemical material would
   contaminate the rest of the residues, making incineration as a final
   destination mandatory for all the waste. This scenario would result in
   significantly more dioxins release and a 64\% higher cost of waste
   management. This low-cost implementation measure was effective in the
   cost reduction of waste management and minimization of air release of
   human carcinogens.}},

   hydro generation-based on a PMSG integrated with a PV array supported by
   the BES. It operates in an IM during the grid outage and when the grid
   is available, it synchronizes and operates in GCM. A frequency adaptive
   comb filter-frequency locked loop (FLL)-based control is adopted to
   estimate errorless phase angles of the hydro generator and grid voltages
   for quick and accurate grid synchronization. A third-order band pass
   filter-based control technique is used to extract fundamental component
   of load currents and determine switching pulses to VSC. The overall
   multi-objective control is used to maintain voltage and frequency of the
   system at the point of common coupling during IM and GCM. The power
   quality of grid and generator currents are maintained at non-linear
   loads. The modified perturb and observe-based control technique is used
   to extract maximum power from the PV array and it provides drift-free

Title = {{Genetic diversity and characteristics of high-level tigecycline

Journal = {{GENOME MEDICINE}},

Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundThe recent emergence and dissemination of high-level mobile
   tigecycline resistance Tet(X) challenge the clinical effectiveness of
   tigecycline, one of the last-resort therapeutic options for complicated
   infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative and Gram-positive
   pathogens. Although tet(X) has been found in various bacterial species,
   less is known about phylogeographic distribution and phenotypic variance
   of different genetic variants.MethodsHerein, we conducted a
   multiregional whole-genome sequencing study of tet(X)-positive
   Acinetobacter isolates from human, animal, and their surrounding
   environmental sources in China. The molecular and enzymatic features of
   tet(X) variants were characterized by clonal expression, microbial
   degradation, reverse transcription, and gene transfer experiments, while
   the tet(X) genetic diversity and molecular evolution were explored by
   comparative genomic and Bayesian evolutionary analyses.ResultsWe
   identified 193 tet(X)-positive isolates from 3846 samples, with the
   prevalence ranging from 2.3 to 25.3\% in nine provinces in China. The
   tet(X) was broadly distributed in 12 Acinetobacter species, including
   six novel species firstly described here. Besides tet(X3) (n=188) and
   tet(X4) (n=5), two tet(X5) variants, tet(X5.2) (n=36) and tet(X5.3)
   (n=4), were also found together with tet(X3) or tet(X4) but without
   additive effects on tetracyclines. These tet(X)-positive Acinetobacter
   spp. isolates exhibited 100\% resistance rates to tigecycline and
   tetracycline, as well as high minimum inhibitory concentrations to
   eravacycline (2-8 mu g/mL) and omadacycline (8-16 mu g/mL). Genetic
   analysis revealed that different tet(X) variants shared an analogous
   ISCR2-mediated transposon structure. The molecular evolutionary analysis
   indicated that Tet(X) variants likely shared the same common ancestor
   with the chromosomal monooxygenases that are found in environmental
   Flavobacteriaceae bacteria, but sequence divergence suggested separation
   similar to 9900years ago (7887BC), presumably associated with the
   mobilization of tet(X)-like genes through horizontal
   transfer.ConclusionsFour tet(X) variants were identified in this study,
   and they were widely distributed in multiple Acinetobacter spp. strains
   from various ecological niches across China. Our research also
   highlighted the crucial role of ISCR2 in mobilizing tet(X)-like genes
   between different Acinetobacter species and explored the evolutionary
   history of Tet(X)-like monooxygenases. Further studies are needed to
   evaluate the clinical impact of these mobile tigecycline resistance
   genes.}},

Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{Background This study describes the usefulness of allergen-specific
   Immunoglobulin E (IgE) serology (ASIS) for identifying allergens in dogs
   with atopic dermatitis. ASIS tests were conducted in 23 dogs diagnosed
   with atopic dermatitis for indoor allergens (yeast and mites), outdoor
   allergens (grass pollen, weed pollen, and tree pollen), and fleas. The
   relationship among positive ASIS tests were determined using Pearson's
   correlation coefficient (r). Results Of the atopic dogs, 26.09\%,
   4.35\%, and 47.83\% had positive ASIS tests for only indoor allergens,
   only outdoor allergens, and both indoor and outdoor allergens,
   respectively. The prevalence of positive ASIS tests was highest for
   mites (69.57\%) and did not differ between indoor and outdoor allergens
   by age, breed, or sex. The prevalence of positive ASIS tests for indoor
   allergens during the rainy season (84.21\%) was significantly higher
   than during winter (25.00\%, P-value = 0.030). The correlation
   coefficient of the ASIS results among the outdoor allergens indicated a
   strong correlation between grass and tree pollen (r = 0.840, P-value <
   0.01), grass and weed pollen (r = 0.812, P-value < 0.01), and tree and
   weed pollen (r = 0.714, P-value < 0.01). The correlation coefficient of
   the ASIS results of D. farinae indicated a strong correlation with A.
   siro (r = 0.951, P-value < 0.01) and a moderate correlation with B.
   tropicalis (r = 0.656, P-value < 0.01) and T. putrescentie (r = 0.672,
   P-value < 0.01). Conclusions ASIS tests are useful in screening for
   multiple allergens in dogs with atopic dermatitis. Dust mites are an
   important source of indoor allergens and may be responsible for a higher
   titer of IgE antibodies against indoor allergens during the rainy
   season.}},

Abstract = {{This study extends our understanding of humble leadership as an
   important trust-engendering leadership style that influences employee
   behaviors. Drawing on social exchange theory, we articulate how humble
   leaders' employee-centric behaviors signal trust and facilitate a social
   exchange relationship between leaders and followers. Specifically, we
   posit that a leader's humble leadership behaviors are positively related
   to employees' task performance and organizational citizenship behavior
   via feelings of being trusted by one's supervisor. We also predict that
   the interaction between humble leadership and employee job autonomy will
   influence employees' appraisal of feeling trusted. We tested our
   moderated-mediation model using experimental vignette data and
   three-wave survey data collected from 233 employees and their
   supervisors working at a large Chinese internet company. Study results
   support our hypotheses that humble leadership, and its interaction with

Abstract = {{Various structural patterns are used to control light properties during
   propagation. In particular, when light is trapped and concentrated onto
   solar cells, they generate more electricity than without concentration.
   Since the sun moves continuously, a compound parabolic concentrator
   (CPC) can enhance the efficiency of solar cells by light-trapping and
   concentration because a CPC minimizes optical loss by reducing the
   reflection and the scattering on the surface of solar cells. However,
   CPC devices are generally expensive to manufacture and are too large in
   size to be used for applications requiring portability. Here, we
   developed a novel manufacturing process for a small CPC device and
   verified the enhanced efficiency of solar cells. Based on ultra-fine
   planing and injection molding, this process is an efficient method for
   mass production because it relies on replication. Two metal molds were
   precisely machined using an ultra-fine planing method with a diamond
   tool, and a CPC device was accurately manufactured by injection molding
   at low cost and within one minute. The variation of the specific cutting
   resistance during machining of the metal molds increased by four times,
   and the minimum uncut chip thickness decreased from 1.3 to 0.5 mu m,
   which is called a size effect. The finished CPC device exhibited a
   surface roughness less than 40 nm and showed high optical efficiency in
   virtue of light-trapping. Finally, the efficiency of a solar cell with
   the CPC device was enhanced about 10\%.}},

Abstract = {{Background Modern neonatal ventilators allow the downloading of their
   data with a high sampling rate. We wanted to develop an algorithm that
   automatically recognises and characterises ventilator inflations from
   ventilator pressure and flow data. Methods We downloaded airway pressure
   and flow data with 100 Hz sampling rate from Drager Babylog VN500
   ventilators ventilating critically ill infants. We developed an open
   source Python package, Ventiliser, that includes a rule-based algorithm
   to automatically discretise ventilator data into a sequence of flow and
   pressure states and to recognise ventilator inflations and an
   information gain approach to identify inflation phases (inspiration,
   expiration) and sub-phases (pressure rise, pressure plateau, inspiratory
   hold etc.). Results Ventiliser runs on a personal computer and analyses
   24 h of ventilation in 2 min. With longer recordings, the processing
   time increases linearly. It generates a table reporting indices of each
   breath and its sub-phases. Ventiliser also allows visualisation of
   individual inflations as waveforms or loops. Ventiliser identified >97\%
   of ventilator inflations and their sub-phases in an out-of-sample
   validation of manually annotated data. We also present detailed
   quantitative analysis and comparison of two 1-hour-long ventilation
   periods. Conclusions Ventiliser can analyse ventilation patterns and
   ventilator-patient interactions over long periods of mechanical
   ventilation. Impact
   We have developed a computational method to recognize and analyse
   ventilator inflations from raw data downloaded from ventilators of
   preterm and critically ill infants. There have been no previous reports
   on the computational analysis of neonatal ventilator data. We have made
   our program, , freely available. Clinicians and researchers can use to
   analyse ventilator inflations, waveforms and loops over long periods.
   can also be used to study ventilator-patient interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Pain sensation is powerfully modulated by signal processing in the
   brain, and pain becomes chronic with the dysfunction of the pain
   modulatory system; however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We
   found that the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) in the
   periaqueductal gray (PAG), the key area of endogenous pain modulation,
   is persistently active in normal conditions to maintain an appropriate
   sensory perception. In the neuropathic pain condition, Homer1a, an
   activity-dependent immediate early gene product, disrupted the
   persistent mGluR5 activity resulting in chronic pain. Remarkably a
   single-time blockage of the mGluR5 resulted in chronic neuropathic
   pain-like symptoms even in the absence of nerve injury. The decline of
   mGluR5 activity induced the pain modulatory dysfunction with a profound
   reduction of excitability of PAG neurons. These findings uncover the
   role of the persistent mGluR5 activity in vivo and provide new insight
   into how pain becomes chronic with the maladaptive coping of the PAG to
   pain sensation.}},

Title = {{Catalogue of oribatid mites (Acari: Oribatida) from Continental
   Southeast Asia}},
Journal = {{ZOOTAXA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{4893}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a catalogue of oribatid mites (Acari, Oribatida)
   recorded from Continental Southeast Asia (CSEA) covering a period of 55
   years from 1965 to the first half of 2020. This subregion comprises
   countries that are located on the southeastern coast of the Asian
   continent, namely, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. For
   each species, information is compiled on references to the original
   description, subsequent re-combinations of specific name with other
   genera, and junior synonyms used in CSEA literature, if any, as well as
   type habitat, habitats recorded later, and distribution within outside
   CSEA. A historical review of explorations and taxonomic studies in the
   various countries is also provided.
   A total of 820 valid species including subspecies and seven doubtful
   species are known so far from CSEA. The valid species belong to 313
   genera and subgenera, 94 families and 36 superfamilies in all of the
   five infraorders and two hyporders of the Suborder Oribatida. The
   Hyporder Brachypylina is most diverse with 620 species, followed by
   Mixonomata (88), Enarthronota (65), Nothrina (41), Palaeosomata (5) and
   Parhyposomata (1). Vietnam whose fauna has been best explored tops the
   records with 730 species, followed by a low second by Thailand (137),
   then Cambodia (37) and Myanmar (11) while the oribatid fauna of Laos is
   still entirely unknown. Altogether, the oribatid fauna of Southeast Asia
   (SEA), including its two subregions, now totals 1601 species belonging
   to 477 genera, 109 families and 40 superfamilies.
   Species that are known so far only from CSEA countries and thus probably
   endemic is highest at 36.4\% for Myanmar, 32,1\% for Thailand, 23.7\%
   for Vietnam, 0 for Cambodia, 27.2\% for CSEA, 59.0\% for the Malay
   Archipelago, and 48.7\% for SEA as a whole. About 7\% of the recorded
   species of Thailand and Vietnam are cosmopolitan or semicosmopolitan in
   distribution, but their faunal elements are decidedly Oriental, with
   about half (43-54\%) occurring also in other Oriental countries. The
   same countries also share in common many species with other
   zoogeographic regions, viz. 12-14\% Palaearctic, 8-16\% Australian,
   8-11\% Neotropical, 3-11\% Ethiopian, and 1-3\% Nearctic.Y}},

Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{Habitats along linear infrastructure, such as roads and electrical
   transmission lines, can have high local biodiversity. To determine
   whether these habitats also contribute to landscape-scale biodiversity,
   we estimated species richness, evenness and phylogenetic diversity of
   plant, butterfly and bumblebee communities in 32 km(2) landscapes with
   or without power line corridors, and with contrasting areas of road
   verges. Landscapes with power line corridors had on average six more
   plant species than landscapes without power lines, but there was no such
   effect for butterflies and bumblebees. Plant communities displayed
   considerable evenness in species abundances both in landscapes with and
   without power lines and high and low road verge densities. We
   hypothesize that the higher number of plant species in landscapes with
   power line corridors is due to these landscapes having a higher
   extinction debt than the landscapes without power line corridors, such
   that plant diversity is declining slower in landscapes with power lines.
   This calls for targeted conservation actions in semi-natural grasslands
   within landscapes with power line corridors to maintain biodiversity and
   prevent imminent population extinctions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper argues that the 100\% money proposal of the 1930s should not
   (as is often the case) simply be considered as an avatar, extended to
   deposit currency, of the Currency School's reform prescriptions. The
   English Bank Charter Act of 1844, indeed, conveyed a double rejection:
   it not only sought to divorce the issuing from the lending of money, but
   also to prevent all kind of monetary management, by enacting a specific
   issuing rule (the ``currency principle{''}) into law. The 100\% money
   proposal, in contrast, was designed independently of any monetary policy
   recommendations, leaving open the debate of ``rules versus
   discretion{''}.}},

Title = {{T-S Fuzzy System Controller for Stabilizing the Double Inverted Pendulum}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN FUZZY SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{This article provides a representation of the double inverted pendulum
   system that is shaped and regulated in response to torque application at
   the top rather than the bottom of the pendulum, given that most
   researchers have controlled the double inverted pendulum based on the
   lower part or the base. To achieve this objective, we designed a dynamic
   Lagrangian conceptualization of the double inverted pendulum and a state
   feedback representation based on the simple convex polytypic
   transformation. Finally, we used the fuzzy state feedback approach to
   linearize the mathematical nonlinear model and to develop a fuzzy
   controller H infinity, given its great ability to simplify nonlinear
   systems in order to reduce the error rate and to increase precision. In
   our virtual conceptualization of the inverted pendulum, we used MATLAB
   software to simulate the movement of the system before applying a
   command on the upper part of the system to check its stability.
   Concerning the nonlinearities of the system, we have found a state
   feedback fuzzy control approach. Overall, the simulation results have
   shown that the fuzzy state feedback model is very efficient and flexible
   as it can be modified in different positions.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the extreme weather pattern accompanying the
   widespread flash flooding in unpredicted areas during mid-March to April
   of 2019 in Iran. During this time, the active weather frontal system
   with heavy and insistent rainfalls drenched Iran (mostly north, west and
   southern), Iraq and Turkey (eastern part). The climatological mean and
   anomalies of the meteorological datasets from the National Centers for
   Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis model are examined, and
   synoptic and dynamical patterns are compared. The anomaly weather maps
   are created for different parameters to show the abnormal features
   during the study period (months of March and April 2019) presenting
   significant differences from the thirty-year climate normals of the
   period 1981-2010. This research shows an intensified pressure gradient,
   strong vertical motion and strengthened 500 hPa mid-tropospheric
   westerly currents during the study period. The relative humidity at 850
   hPa shows on average similar to 4-11\% higher values than the climate
   normal. The surface wind vector analysis reveals the intensified south
   flows originated from Oman sea and the Indian Ocean providing rather
   warmer and wet air mass encounters with an abnormal regional colder
   surface air mass. Upper level wind vectors at 250 hPa and vertical
   profile of the meridional wind anomalies exhibit a wavy jet pattern
   compared to the climate normal structure along with the significant
   vertical meridional wind shear as the sign of climate change. These
   abnormal atmospheric changes can contribute to forming extreme weather
   development over the study area during the study period. Also,
   understanding the recent extreme atmospheric changes in the study area
   may contribute to a better future forecast when such floods may happen
   again.}},

   prostate: a case report}},
Journal = {{BMC UROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},

Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{Background Transurethral resection of the prostate (TUR-P) is one of the
   most frequent routine procedures in urology. Because of the semisterile
   environment, postoperative infections, including sepsis, are a common
   complication, with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis
   or Enterococcus faecalis as frequently isolated pathogens. Facklamia
   hominis is a gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic, alpha-hemolytic,
   catalase-negative coccus that was first described in 1997. To date, only
   a few cases of infectious complications have been described. We report
   the first case of postoperative bacteremia due to Facklamia hominis
   after TUR-P. Case presentation An 82-year-old man developed fever only a
   few hours after elective TUR-P because of benign prostate syndrome.
   After cultivation of blood cultures, antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone
   was intravenously administered and changed to oral cotrimoxazole before
   discharge of the afebrile patient. One anaerobic blood culture revealed
   Facklamia hominis. Under antibiotic therapy, the patient remained
   afebrile and showed no signs of infections during follow-up. Conclusions
   Fever and bacteremia are frequent complications after TUR-P. This study
   is the first report of Facklamia hominis in a postoperative blood
   culture after TUR-P. To date, there are only a few reports of patients
   with infectious complications and isolation of Facklamia hominis in
   various patient samples. Because Facklamia hominis resembles viridans
   streptococci on blood agar analysis, this pathogen may often be
   misidentified. In this case identification of Facklamia hominis was
   possible with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight
   mass spectrometry. It has been postulated that Facklamia hominis might
   be a facultative pathogen and that its incidence will increase in the
   future.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the frequency of autoimmune antibody testing in
   an inpatient neurology setting and its influence on immunotherapy use on
   an inpatient neurology service. Methods: A retrospective descriptive
   cohort study of patients admitted to the neurology inpatient service at
   a large tertiary academic medical center who had autoimmune and/or
   paraneoplastic antibody testing performed between 10/1/2017 and
   10/1/2018. Characteristics of patients' initial clinical presentation,
   antibody testing results, test timing in relation to initiating
   immunotherapy, and final diagnosis using consensus criteria were
   extracted and analyzed. Case reports of patients with positive antibody
   panels are presented. Results: Of 1,604 patients, 50 patients (3.1\%)
   had an antibody panel sent. Tests resulted after an average of 17 days
   (range 7-27). The most common clinical presenting symptom in those with
   a panel sent was encephalopathy. There were 5 (10\%) positive serum
   panels and no positive CSF panels. Only one of these 5 patients had
   autoimmune encephalitis and was treated with immunotherapy. Of those
   with negative serum and CSF panels, 15 were treated acutely with empiric
   immunotherapy and the remainder with supportive care. Of those treated
   with immunotherapy, 14/15 (93\%) were treated before the panel tests
   resulted. Four patients who had negative panels but were empirically
   treated met consensus criteria for an autoimmune-mediated neurologic
   process. Conclusion: Our study suggests that the results of antibody
   testing did not influence inpatient neurologists' decision to treat with
   immunotherapy as most treatments began prior to final results being
   available.}},

   Gradient}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{We studied hybrid interactions of Lilium meleagrinum, Lilium
   gongshanense, and Lilium saluenense using an integrative approach
   combining population genetics, fieldwork, and phenological research.
   These three species occur along an elevational gradient, with L.
   meleagrinum occurring at lower elevations, L. saluenense at higher
   elevations, and L. gongshanense between them. The species show strong
   morphological differentiation despite there being no clear environmental
   barriers to gene flow among them. Lilium gongshanense is likely to have
   a hybrid origin based on our prior work, but its progenitors remain
   uncertain. We sought to determine whether gene flow occurs among these
   three parapatric species, and, if so, whether L. gongshanense is a
   hybrid of L. meleagrinum and/or L. saluenense. We analyzed data from
   multiple chloroplast genes and spacers, nuclear internal transcribed
   spacer (ITS), and 18 nuclear Expressed Sequence Tag-Simple Sequence
   Repeat (EST-SSR) microsatellites for accessions of the three species
   representing dense population-level sampling. We also inferred phenology
   by examining species in the field and using herbarium specimens. We
   found that there are only two types of chloroplast genomes shared among
   the three species and that L. gongshanense forms two distinct groups
   with closest links to other species of Lilium based on ITS. Taken
   together, L. gongshanense is unlikely to be a hybrid species resulting
   from a cross between L. meleagrinum and L. saluenense, but gene flow is
   occurring among the three species. The gene flow is likely to be rare
   according to evidence from all molecular datasets, and this is
   corroborated by detection of only one putative hybrid individual in the
   field and asynchronous phenology. We suspect that the rarity of
   hybridization events among the species facilitates their continued
   genetic separation.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The Prevention With Mediterranean Diet (PREDIMED) trial
   supported the effectiveness of a nutritional intervention conducted by a
   dietitian to prevent cardiovascular disease. However, the effect of a
   remote intervention to follow the Mediterranean diet has been less
   explored.
   Objective: This study aims to assess the effectiveness of a remotely
   provided Mediterranean diet-based nutritional intervention in obtaining
   favorable dietary changes in the context of a secondary prevention trial
   of atrial fibrillation (AF).
   Methods: The PREvention of recurrent arrhythmias with Mediterranean diet
   (PREDIMAR) study is a 2-year multicenter, randomized, controlled,
   single-blinded trial to assess the effect of the Mediterranean diet
   enriched with extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) on the prevention of atrial
   tachyarrhythmia recurrence after catheter ablation. Participants in
   sinus rhythm after ablation were randomly assigned to an intervention
   group (Mediterranean diet enriched with EVOO) or a control group (usual
   clinical care). The remote nutritional intervention included phone
   contacts (1 per 3 months) and web-based interventions with provision of
   dietary recommendations, and participants had access to a web page, a
   mobile app, and printed resources. The information is divided into 6
   areas: Recommended foods, Menus, News and Online resources, Practical
   tips, Mediterranean diet classroom, and Your personal experience. At
   baseline and at 1-year and 2-year follow-up, the 14-item Mediterranean
   Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) questionnaire and a semiquantitative
   food frequency questionnaire were collected by a dietitian by phone.
   Results: A total of 720 subjects were randomized (365 to the
   intervention group, 355 to the control group). Up to September 2020, 560
   subjects completed the first year (560/574, retention rate 95.6\%) and
   304 completed the second year (304/322, retention rate 94.4\%) of the
   intervention. After 24 months of follow-up, increased adherence to the
   Mediterranean diet was observed in both groups, but the improvement was
   significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group
   (net between-group difference: 1.8 points in the MEDAS questionnaire
   (95\% CI 1.4-2.2; P<.001). Compared with the control group, the
   Mediterranean diet intervention group showed a significant increase in
   the consumption of fruits (P<.001), olive oil (P<.001), whole grain
   cereals (P=.002), pulses (P<.001), nuts (P<.001), white fish (P<.001),
   fatty fish (P<.001), and white meat (P=.007), and a significant
   reduction in refined cereals (P<.001), red and processed meat (P<.001),
   and sweets (P<.001) at 2 years of intervention. In terms of nutrients,
   the intervention group significantly increased their intake of omega-3
   (P<.001) and fiber (P<.001), and they decreased their intake of
   carbohydrates (P=.02) and saturated fatty acids (P<.001) compared with
   the control group.
   Conclusions: The remote nutritional intervention using a website and
   phone calls seems to be effective in increasing adherence to the
   Mediterranean diet pattern among AF patients treated with catheter
   ablation.}},

Abstract = {{Flexible piezoresistive films, such as, carbon
   black/polydimethylsiloxane (C-PDMS) composites, are often used as skin
   analogs and integrated into complex array sensors for tactile sensing.
   The uniformity of the sensor characteristics heavily depends on the
   homogeneity of the composite. Therefore, the ability to locally
   characterize a film that will be integrated into a complex force sensor
   could be critical. Here, a method to characterize the local sensitivity
   of flexible piezoresistive films is presented. Using a conductive
   sphere, which was chosen over a flat probe to eliminate misalignment
   issues, the surface of a thin film composite is indented to characterize
   the change in resistivity in terms of average strain. Experiments were
   performed with 15 and 18 wt\% carbon black C-PDMS films of varying
   thickness. The contact radius of the probe with the piezoresistive film
   was estimated using the Johnson-Roberts-Kendall contact theory.
   Theoretical contact area estimates were found to agree with contact
   radius measurements carried out using optically transparent PDMS films
   observed through an optical microscope. Results show that C-PDMS with 15
   wt\% carbon black exhibit a higher rate if change of resistivity and
   gauge factor than films of same thickness with 18 wt\% carbon black. On
   the other hand, thicker films exhibit higher gauge factors for the two
   tested carbon black contents. Tests carried out at multiple locations
   yielded consistent sensitivity values, making these types of composites
   suitable for array type force sensors.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Transgenic crops producing insecticidal proteins derived from
   Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are used globally to kill key insect pests
   and provide numerous benefits, including improved pest management,
   increased profits, reduced insecticide use, and increased biological
   control. Unfortunately, such benefits are rapidly being lost by the
   evolution of Bt resistance by pests.
   RESULTS The main strategy to delay resistance relies on the use of
   non-Bt refuge plants to produce sufficient susceptible insects that mate
   with rare resistant insects emerging from Bt crops, essentially diluting
   and/or removing resistance alleles from pest populations. A key
   assumption for the success of this refuge strategy is that inheritance
   of resistance is recessive. In China, dominant resistance to Cry1Ac Bt
   cotton by the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera is increasing and is
   associated with a mutation in the tetraspanin HaTSPAN1 gene, conferring
   more than 125-fold resistance. Here, we used amplicon sequencing to test
   the hypotheses that the HaTSPAN1 mutation either arose from a single
   event and spread or that the mutation evolved independently several
   times throughout northern China. From three laboratory strains and 28
   field populations sampled from northern China, we identified six
   resistant and 50 susceptible haplotypes. Phylogenetic analysis indicates
   that the HaTSPAN1 mutation arose from at least four independent origins
   and spread to their current distributions.
   CONCLUSION The results provide valuable information about the
   evolutionary origins of dominant resistance to Cry1Ac Bt cotton in
   northern China and offer rationale for the rapid increase in
   field-evolved resistance in these areas, where the implementation of
   additional practical resistance management is needed.}},

Abstract = {{Deep eutectic solvents (DES) formed by quaternary ammonium salts and
   hydrogen bond donors are a promising green alternative to organic
   solvents. Their high viscosity at ambient temperatures can limit
   biocatalytic applications and therefore requires fine-tuning by
   adjusting water content and temperature. Here, we performed a
   meta-analysis of the impact of water content and temperature on the
   viscosities of four deep eutectic solvents (glyceline, reline,
   N,N-diethylethanol ammonium chloride-glycerol, N,N-diethylethanol
   ammonium chloride-ethylene glycol), their components (choline chloride,
   urea, glycerol, ethylene glycol), methanol, and pure water. We analyzed
   the viscosity data by an automated workflow, using Arrhenius and
   Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann-Hesse models. The consistency and completeness of
   experimental data and metadata was used as an essential criterion of
   data quality. We found that viscosities were reported for different
   temperature ranges, half the time without specifying a method of
   desiccation, and in almost half of the reports without specifying
   experimental errors. We found that the viscosity of the pure components
   varied widely, but that all aqueous mixtures (except for reline) have
   similar excess activation energy of viscous flow E-eta(excess)= 3-5
   kJ/mol, whereas reline had a negative excess activation energy
   (E-eta(excess)= - 19 kJ/mol). The data and workflows used are accessible

Journal = {{EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Background. Chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) is an important stage in
   the normal gastric mucosa's transformation into gastric cancer.
   Huazhuojiedu decoction (HZJD), a Chinese herbal preparation, has proven
   clinically effective to treat CAG. However, few studies have explored
   the mechanism of HZJD in CAG treatment. Purpose. This study aimed to
   shed light on the mechanisms underlying HZJD decoction CAG treatment
   using a network pharmacology approach and experimental validation.
   Methods. The active components of HZJD decoction were obtained from the
   Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis
   Platform. Their targets were predicted through the SwissTargetPrediction
   database. Disease targets were screened using the GeneCards database.
   The disease and drug prediction targets were intersected to select the
   common potential therapeutic targets, which then were input into the
   Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes to build a
   protein-protein interaction network. The
   ``herb-compound-target-disease{''} and the ``herb-target-pathway{''}
   network diagrams were constructed in Cytoscape 3.3.0. Gene Ontology and
   Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis of
   effective targets were performed using the Database for Annotation,
   Visualization, and Integrated Discovery. Finally, the core targets were
   preliminarily verified by CAG rat model. The gastric mucosa's
   histopathological changes were observed via hematoxylin-eosin staining.
   The expressions of MAPK1, AKT1, TNF, VEGFA, and EGFR were detected by
   western blot and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase
   chain reaction. Results. A total of 155 nodes, including 20 putative
   targets of HZJD decoction, were selected as core hubs based on
   topological importance and were closely associated with the regulation
   of cell proliferation, apoptotic process, and cancer-related pathways
   (AKT1, TNF, VEGFA, and EGFR) in CAG. Further animal experiments showed
   that the expression of AKT1 in CAG rats was significantly increased,
   which was suppressed by HZJD decoction. TNF and VEGFA expression
   increased in the model group, but did not change in the HZJD group.
   MAPK1 and EGFR expression showed no significant differences among
   control, model, and HZJD groups. Conclusion. Taken together, the results
   suggest that the components of HZJD decoction can alleviate and prevent
   the severity of gastric precancerous lesions via AKT1 inhibition in CAG.}},

Abstract = {{Rare-earth (RE) doping is one of the valid approaches to optimize the
   optical performance of the CsPbBr3 perovskite. However, the underlying
   mechanism and the role of the RE\_4f electrons are still unknown, which
   are significant for the development of advanced RE-doped perovskite
   materials. Considering these, a series of CsPbBr3:RE (RE = Ce, Pr, Nd,
   Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb) compounds were studied by applying
   first-principles calculations. Based on the analysis of the phase
   stability diagram, we found that RE doping in the bulk CsPbBr3 leads to
   the formation of the REPb defect. Meanwhile, the two types of
   electric-dipole allowed transition were revealed by exploring the
   electronic structure. We also demonstrated that the doped systems retain
   the defect tolerance nature of the host and the RE\_4f electrons enrich
   the band-edge states, which are the main origins for luminescence
   enhancement. Our current contribution not only presents physical insight
   into the role of RE\_4f electrons in luminescence, but also provides a
   guideline for designing the targeted RE-doped perovskites.}},

Title = {{Combined hazard of typhoon-generated meteorological tsunamis and storm
   surges along the coast of Japan}},

Abstract = {{Two hazardous typhoons, Lionrock (August 2016) and Jebi (September
   2018), destructively affected the coast of Japan and produced extreme
   sea level variations. The results of field surveys in the impacted
   regions showed that multiple deaths and extensive floods were caused by
   the combined effect of low-frequency sea level raise (storm surges) and
   intensive high-frequency (HF) tsunami-like waves (meteotsunamis). The
   data from ten tide gauges for the 2016 event and eight gauges for the
   2018 event were used to examine the properties of the observed sea
   levels, to estimate the relative contribution of the two sea level
   components and to evaluate their statistical characteristics (maximum
   wave heights, amplitudes and periods of individual components, etc.).
   For the 2016 event, we found that the surge heights were from 12 to 35
   cm and that the mean contribution of surges into the total observed sea
   level heights was similar to 39\%; the meteotsunami amplitudes were from
   22 to 92 cm, and they contributed 61\% of the total height. For the 2018
   event, storm surges were significantly stronger, from 46 to 170 cm,
   while HF amplitudes were from 38 to 130 cm; their relative inputs were
   67\% and 33\%, respectively. Combined, they formed total flood heights
   of up to 120 cm (2016 event) and 288 cm (2018 event). Previously, the
   contribution of storm seiches (meteotsunamis) in coastal floods had been
   underestimated, but results of the present study demonstrate that they
   can play the principal role. What is even more important, they produce
   devastating currents: according to our estimates, current speeds were up
   to 3 knots (1.5 m/s) during the Lionrock event and more than 5 knots
   (2.6 m/s) during Jebi; these strong currents appear to be the main
   reason for the resulting damage of coastal infrastructure. The most
   important characteristic of the recorded meteotsunamis is their
   trough-to-crest maximum height. During the 2016 event, these heights at
   three stations were > 1 m: 171 cm at Erimo, 109 cm at Hachijojima and
   102 cm at Ayukawa. The 2018 event was stronger; maximum meteotsunami
   wave heights were 257 cm at Gobo, 138 cm at Kushimoto, 137 cm at Kumano
   and 128 cm at Murotomisaki. The 2018 Gobo height of 257 cm is much
   larger than historical non-seismic seiche maxima for the Pacific coast
   of Japan (140-169 cm) estimated by Nakano and Unoki (1962) for the
   period of 1930-1956.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundGenerally, the loss rate of human endothelial cells (HCEC) in
   routine cataract surgery is 8.5\%. When the corneal endothelial cells
   density (ECD) drops, the HCEC may decompensate to keep cornea
   dehydration which leads to corneal edema. Granulomatosis with
   polyangiitis (GPA) is an uncommon autoimmune disease involving multiple
   organs including eyes such as conjunctivitis, scleritis, uveitis, and
   corneal ulcer. In this study, we report two cases of GPA whose corneal
   ECD decreased significantly after phacoemulsification cataract
   surgery.Case presentationIn the first case of 69-year-old male with GPA,
   the ECD dropped 39.6\% (OD) four months after phacoemulsification and
   38.1\% (OS) six months postoperatively respectively. At the final
   follow-up, the residual ECD was only 55\% in the right eye in the 49(th)
   month, and 56\% remained in the left eye in the 39(th) month. In the
   second case of 54-year old female, left ECD dropped 63.9\% at the 4(th)
   month after surgery and 69.6\% ECD remained at the 15(th) month
   postoperatively while similar ECD of right eye before and after left eye
   surgery.ConclusionExtensive preoperative ophthalmic evaluation and
   meticulous postoperative inflammation control should be applied to
   prevent severe loss of HCEC in GPA patients.}},

Abstract = {{We experimentally demonstrate a high-speed lateral PIN junction
   configuration germanium photodetector (Ge-PD) with 4-directional light
   input. The typical internal responsivity is about 1.23 A/W at 1550 nm
   with 98\% quantum efficiency and dark current 4 nA at 1V reverse-bias
   voltage. The equivalent circuit model and theoretical 3-dB
   opto-electrical (OE) bandwidth of Ge-PD are extracted and calculated,
   respectively. Compared to the conventional lateral PIN Ge-PD with
   1-directional light input, our proposed device features uniform optical
   field distribution in the absorption region, which will be benefit to
   realize high-power and high-speed operation. In particular, in the
   condition of 0.8 mA photocurrent, the measured 3-dB OE bandwidth is
   about 17 GHz at bias voltage of -8 V which is well matched to the
   theoretical estimated bandwidth. With additional digital
   pre-compensations provided by the Keysight arbitrary waveform generator
   (AWG), the root raised cosine (RRC) filter and roll-off factor of 0.65
   are employed at transmitter (TX) side without utilizing any offline
   digital signal processing (DSP) at receiver (RX) side. The 50 Gbit/s, 60
   Gbit/s, 70 Gbit/s, and 80 Gbit/s non-return-to-zero (NRZ), and 60
   Gbit/s, 70 Gbit/s, 80 Gbit/s, and 90 Gbit/s four-level pulse amplitude
   modulation (PAM-4) clear opening of eye diagrams are realized. In order
   to verify the high-power handling performance in high-speed data
   transmission, we also investigate the 20 Gbit/s NRZ eye diagram
   variations with the increasing of photocurrent. (C) 2020 Optical Society

Title = {{Safety and Efficacy of Adding Dapagliflozin to Furosemide in Type 2
   Diabetic Patients With Decompensated Heart Failure and Reduced Ejection
   Fraction}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Heart failure is the most common cause of hospitalization in
   elderly patients. It is likely that many of the mechanisms that
   contribute to reductions in systolic and diastolic function, seen in
   diabetic patients, place them at an increased risk of heart failure.
   Diuretic therapy, especially loop diuretics, is the usual way of
   managing congestion, particularly in volume-overloaded patients. Little
   is known about the beneficial effect of dapagliflozin when added to loop
   diuretics in managing patients with decompensated heart failure.
   Aim: To assess the effect of the addition of dapagliflozin to furosemide
   in managing decompensated patient with heart failure and reduced left
   ventricular ejection fraction in terms of weight loss and dyspnea
   improvement.
   Patients and Methods: The study included 100 type 2 diabetic patients
   who were admitted with decompensated heart failure. The study population
   was randomly divided into two arms. Serum electrolytes and kidney
   functions were followed up during their hospital stay.
   Results: With dapagliflozin, there was a statistically significant
   difference between the two groups regarding the change in body weight
   and body mass index. The diuresis parameters including urine output,
   total fluid loss, and fluid balance also showed a statistically
   significant difference in favor of the use of dapagliflozin, with no
   significant change in serum potassium or kidney functions. There was
   significant improvement in patient-reported dyspnea scores with the use
   of dapagliflozin.
   Conclusions: Dapagliflozin may provide a new drug option in the
   treatment of heart failure especially among vulnerable group of
   diabetics. It had no remarkable effects on serum potassium level and
   kidney functions.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate prediction of water properties in its gas and condensed phases,
   including the interaction of water with surfaces, is of prime importance
   for many scientific disciplines. However, accurate simulation of all
   water properties together within semilocal approximations of the density
   functional theory possesses great challenges. The Strongly Constrained
   and Appropriately Normed semilocal density functional, which satisfies
   17 known exact constraints and includes the intermediate range van der
   Waals interaction, performs quite well for different properties of water
   including the correct energy ordering of isomers. Despite its impressive
   performance, the energy overestimation for water isomers, ice lattice
   energies, and volume underestimation for ice are noticeable. However, it
   is recently shown that {[}S. Jana et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput. 16(2),
   974-987 (2020)] meta-generalized gradient approximations based on the
   density matrix expansion {[}i.e., Tao-Mo (TM) and revised TM (revTM)]
   can achieve quite a good accuracy for the diverse properties of water.
   In this paper, we assess the performance of the dispersion corrected
   counterparts of the TM and revTM functionals. It is shown that the
   dispersion corrected counterparts of both methods are also quite
   accurate for diverse water properties, especially for the water-solid
   interactions. Moreover, the extent of accuracy of TM-based functionals
   is also analyzed from the viewpoint of the density and functional-driven
   error. Finally, a comparison in the performance of the dispersion
   corrected functionals is exhibited. It is shown that the ``Optimized
   Power{''} damping function together with Grimme's D3 correction and
   revTM functional is in excellent agreement for the water adsorption on
   carbon nanostructure materials and ice-lattice mismatch problem without
   deviating accuracy of other water properties compared to its bare
   functional.}},

   Among Victims of Technology-Assisted Child Sexual Abuse}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to gain a first-person perspective on
   the experiences of technology-assisted child sexual abuse (TA-CSA), and
   a deeper understanding of the way it may affect its victims. Seven young
   women (aged 17-24) with experience of TA-CSA before the age of 18
   participated in individual in-depth interviews. The interviews were
   teller-focused with the aim of capturing the interviewee's own story
   about how they made sense of their experiences over time, and what
   impact the victimization had on them in the short and long terms.
   Thematic analysis of the interviews revealed a broad range of abusive
   experiences that had profoundly impacted the individuals' lives, health
   and self-concepts. Three dominant themes emerged from the analysis -
   From thrilling to abusive, Negative effect on health and wellbeing, and
   A new self after the abuse. From thrilling to abusive captures the wide
   range of experiences described, starting from the child's own sexual
   curiosity to descriptions of having been manipulated or threatened into
   engaging in sexual activity, as well as the sometimes long and complex
   process of understanding the severity of one's experiences. Negative
   effect on health and wellbeing describes the victimization's
   comprehensive impact on the life and health of the participants, how
   they blamed themselves for what had happened, and the struggle of having
   to live with the constant fear of pictures from the abuse resurfacing. A
   new self after the abuse depicts how the victimization impacted the way
   participants viewed and thought about themselves in relation to others,
   and distorted their views of their bodies. The findings are discussed in
   relation to previous research on both offline CSA and TA-CSA, as well as
   theoretical and practical implications.}},

Title = {{Charge and thermoelectric transport mechanism in donor-acceptor
   copolymer films}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{Wearable thermoelectric conversion devices are one of the key
   technologies for future sustainable society, and flexible conducting
   polymer films are strong candidates for these applications. However, the
   thermoelectric transport mechanism of these materials is still unclear
   due to their unique disordered nature, in particular the poor
   interconnectivity between crystalline domains. Here, to overcome this
   limit, donor-acceptor (D-A) copolymer films are selected because of the
   efficient connection between domains via rigid tie molecules. We
   investigated their thermoelectric and carrier transport properties using
   the electrolyte-gating technique and perfectly described both of them
   based on the two-dimensional variable range hopping model with a linear
   density of states around the Fermi level energy. The present results
   provide a fundamental understanding of the thermoelectric physics in D-A
   copolymer films towards application in wearable devices.}},

Title = {{Anisotine and amarogentin as promising inhibitory candidates against
   SARS-CoV-2 proteins: a computational investigation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE \& DYNAMICS}},
Abstract = {{The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the novel
   severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), presents
   an unprecedented challenge to global public health with researchers
   striving to find a possible therapeutic candidate that could limit the
   spread of the virus. In this context, the present study employed an in
   silico molecular interaction-based approach to estimate the inhibitory
   potential of the phytochemicals from ethnomedicinally relevant Indian
   plants including Justicia adhatoda, Ocimum sanctum and Swertia chirata,
   with reported antiviral activities against crucial SARS-CoV-2 proteins.
   SARS-CoV-2 proteins associated with host attachment and viral
   replication namely, spike protein, main protease enzyme M-pro and
   RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) are promising druggable targets for
   COVID-19 therapeutic research. Extensive molecular docking of the
   phytocompounds at the binding pockets of the viral proteins revealed
   their promising inhibitory potential. Subsequent assessment of
   physicochemical features and potential toxicity of the compounds
   followed by robust molecular dynamics simulations and analysis of
   MM-PBSA energy scoring function revealed anisotine against SARS-CoV-2
   spike and M-pro proteins and amarogentin against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp as
   potential inhibitors. It was interesting to note that these compounds
   displayed significantly higher binding energy scores against the
   respective SARS-CoV-2 proteins compared to the relevant drugs that are
   currently being targeted against them. Present research findings confer
   scopes to explore further the potential of these compounds in vitro and
   in vivo towards deployment as efficient SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors and
   development of novel effective therapeutics.
