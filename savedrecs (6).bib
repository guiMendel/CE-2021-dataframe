Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the effect of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)
   mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) on the invasion and metastasis in
   cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) cell line(SCL-1) and to study
   whether the effect was via the MTSS1 gene and p63 gene related pathways.
   Methods: SCL-1 cells were cultured and submitted to ALA-PDT treatment
   (ALA-PDT group), ALA treatment alone (ALA group), LED illumination alone
   (LED group) and remains untreated (control group). Scratch test,
   Transwell migration chamber assay and Matrigel cell invasion assay were
   used to detect the ability of migration and invasion of SCL-1 cells
   after treatment. The mRNA levels and protein expressions of tumor
   metastasis suppressor gene (MTSS1) and p63 gene were further detected by
   using quantitative real-time PCR and flow cytometry assay respectively
   after treatment.
   Results: The migration and invasion abilities of SCL-1 cells after
   treatment were significantly reduced in the ALAPDT groups than that in
   ALA group, LED group and control group (P<0.05). Both the mRNA and
   protein expression levels of MTSS1 gene were up-regulated, while the
   mRNA and protein expression levels of p63 gene were down-regulated after
   ALA-PDT treatment.
   Conclusion: ALA-PDT suppressed the migration and invasion of human cSCC
   cell line, probably via the MTSS1 gene and p63 gene related pathways.
   This study put forward a possible mechanism of invasion in SCL-1 cell,
   also providing a potential target for the therapy of cSCC.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, the entrepreneurial development of taobao village based
   on e-business has led to a new round growth of rural economy in China.
   This paper constructs a evolution analysis framework of taobao village
   entrepreneurial network based on the big data of taobao intelligent
   information system from the year 2007-2016. The social network analysis
   software Gephi was applied to analyze the data. The result is that:
   Firstly, the early emerged online shops with high betweenness centrality
   degree, which mastered important resources and power within the network,
   formed a strong entrepreneurial demonstration effect to the other shops.
   Secondly, in taobao village, the number of strong relationship shops
   increased, entrepreneurial network gradually dispersed characteristics
   of clustering, entrepreneurial network community structure strength
   enhanced, division quality optimization, and the transmission
   performance and efficiency of entrepreneurial network improved. The
   entrepreneurial network has a typical characteristic of
   ``acquaintance{''} network business conduction. Thirdly, the
   entrepreneurial network density of Lin'an taobao village showed a
   significant downward trend, which may be more conducive to the
   homogeneous agricultural products sales shops to access to heterogeneous
   resources, so as to obtain more long-term future development.}},

   Vegetation: A Case Study in Southern Tibet, China}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Frequent droughts in a warming climate tend to induce the degeneration
   of vegetation. Quantifying the response of vegetation to variations in
   drought events is therefore crucial for evaluating the potential impacts
   of climate change on ecosystems. In this study, the standardized
   precipitation index (SPI) was calculated using the precipitation data
   sourced from the China Meteorological Forcing Dataset (CMFD), and then
   the drought events in southern Tibet from 1982 to 2015 were identified
   based on the SPI index. The results showed that the frequency, severity,
   and intensity of drought events in southern Tibet decreased from 1982 to
   2015, and the highest frequency of drought was found between 1993 and
   2000. To evaluate the impact of drought events on vegetation, the
   vegetation characteristic indexes were developed based on the normalized
   difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the drought characteristics. The
   assessment of two drought events showed that the alpine grasslands and
   alpine meadows had high vegetation vulnerability (AI). The assessment of
   multiple drought events showed that responses of vegetation to drought
   were spatially heterogeneous, and the total explain rate of
   environmental factors to the variations in AI accounted for 40\%. Among
   the many environmental factors investigated, the AI were higher at
   middle altitudes (2000-3000 m) than low altitudes (<2000 m) and high
   altitudes (3000-4500 m). Meanwhile, the silt soil fraction in the upper
   soil layer (0-30 cm) had the greatest positive correlation with AI,
   suggesting that areas with a high silt soil fraction were more sensitive
   to drought. The relative contribution rates of environmental factors
   were predicted by a multivariate linear regression (MLR) model. The silt
   soil fraction was found to make the greatest relative contribution
   (23.3\%) to the changes in AI.}},

Journal = {{STEM CELL RESEARCH}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Directed cardiomyogenesis from human induced pluripotent stem cells
   (hiPSCs) has been greatly improved in the last decade but directed
   differentiation to pacemaking cardiomyocytes (CMs) remains incompletely
   understood. In this study, we demonstrated that inhibition of NODAL
   signaling by a specific NODAL inhibitor (SB431542) in the cardiac
   mesoderm differentiation stage downregulated PITX2c, a transcription
   factor that is known to inhibit the formation of the sinoatrial node in
   the left atrium during cardiac development. The resulting hiPSC-CMs were
   smaller in cell size, expressed higher pro-pacemaking transcription
   factors, TBX3 and TBX18, and exhibited pacemaking-like
   electrophysiological characteristics compared to control hiPSC-CMs
   differentiated from established Wnt-based protocol. The pacemaker-like
   subtype increased up to 2.4-fold in hiPSC-CMs differentiated with the
   addition of SB431542 relative to the control. Hence, Nodal inhibition in
   the cardiac mesoderm stage promoted pacemaker-like CM differentiation
   from hiPSCs. Improving the yield of human pacemaker-like CMs is a
   critical first step in the development of functional human cell-based
   biopacemakers.}},

   total extract of Sargassum glaucescens on neuropathy pain induced by
   paclitaxel in mice. Materials and Methods: S. glaucescens was collected
   from the Persian Gulf. The seaweed was extracted by maceration with
   methanol-ethyl acetate (1:1) solvent. The effect of the extract on
   neuropathy pain induced by paclitaxel was analyzed. All results were
   analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. Results: Acute administration
   of S. glaucescens extract (100 and 200 mg/kg intraperitoneally {[}i.p.])
   30 min before the test on the 11th day significantly reduced the
   duration of paw licking (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Chronic treatment with
   S. glaucescens extract (100, 150, and 200 mg/kg i.p.) from the 6th day
   until the 10th day reduced the duration of paw licking. Therefore, S.

Abstract = {{The real mechanisms beyond the effect of nanoparticles on oil phase
   displacement by water are still not completely understood. So, in this
   research, the simultaneous effects of charge and concentration of silica
   nanoparticles on the oil droplet detachment from calcite surface has
   been investigated for the first time. For this aim, the parameters of
   oil droplet contact angle, oil Center Of Mass, Mean Square Displacement
   and viscosity of water phase have been studied by using molecular
   dynamics simulation. The thickness of 15 degrees A is selected for all
   simulations after checking the thickness effect on contact angle
   results. It was declared that initial shape of oil droplet affected on
   final contact angle slightly with the relative error of 0.7\%. According
   to the results, silica nanoparticles can lift the oil droplet from the
   edges because of their interactions with rock surface and water
   viscosity enhancement which leads to intensify viscous forces and
   wettability alteration toward more water wet state. In addition, and
   there is an optimum concentration which decreases with nanoparticle
   charge rising. In neutral system, the most contact angle alteration
   occurs in presence of 14 nanoparticles. While the amount of optimum
   concentration decreased with the growth of nanoparticle's charge and
   reached to 4 nanoparticles at charge of 0.4 electrons. In addition,
   there is an optimum charge and it is 0.4e for nanoparticles. The state
   of rock wettability depends on nanoparticle properties such as charge,
   size and concentration and this lets us to design a nanoparticle with
   best performance and least cost.}},

Abstract = {{We analyzed the archival data of the continuum emission at six
   wavelengths from 3 to 0.4 mm and (CO)-C-13 and (CO)-O-18 (1-0, 2-1, and
   3-2) lines in the protoplanetary disk around HD 142527 obtained with the
   Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. We performed fitting to
   the spectral energy distributions obtained at the six wavelengths with
   the graybody slab models to estimate the distributions of the dust
   surface density and spectral index of dust absorption coefficient beta.
   We also estimated the distribution of the gas column density by fitting
   the (CO)-O-18 spectra and measured the disk rotation by fitting the
   Keplerian disk models to the (CO)-O-18 data. We found super- and
   sub-Keplerian rotation inside and outside the dust ring in the northwest
   in the HD 142527 disk, suggestive of the presence of a local pressure
   bump. In comparison with our estimated dust and gas distributions, the
   location of the pressure bump is coincident with the region showing a
   three times higher dust density and a three times lower gas-to-dust mass
   ratio than the mean values in the disk, suggesting dust trapping in the
   pressure bump. Nevertheless, there is no correlation between our derived
   beta distribution and the location of the pressure bump. In addition, we
   found that the width of the dust ring is comparable to or larger than
   the width of the pressure bump, which could suggest that dust feedback
   is significant in the pressure bump.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Total knee arthroplasty has been adopted to be the most
   successful treatment for advanced knee osteoarthritis. The adoption of
   multimodal periarticular analgesic (MPI) has been shown to have
   satisfactory pain control after surgery. However, there is relatively
   lack of data investigating whether this mode of pain control is
   effective in enhancing rehabilitation. Method: This is a prospective
   randomized control trial from July 2017 to June 2018, including 82
   patients, in which 43 of them had MPI injection and 39 of them had no
   MPI injection. Primary outcome measures included the number of days
   required to perform straight leg raise, length of hospital stay, and
   Insall knee score upon discharge. Secondary outcome measures included
   total dose of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) consumption
   postoperatively and visual analog scale (VAS) at rest and on motion
   during postoperative days 1-4. Result: The MPI group performed
   significantly better than the femoral nerve block (FNB) group in terms
   of early functional outcome, namely the number of days required to
   perform straight leg raising and length of hospital stay. The total
   postoperative PCA consumption and VAS score on motion during
   postoperative day 1 were also significantly better for MPI group. There
   was no difference in Insall knee score upon discharge between these two
   groups. Conclusion: Compared to FNB, MPI depicts a faster inpatient
   rehabilitation, accounted by its quadriceps-sparing, and better pain
   relief especially in the early postoperative period.}},

   and school readiness at five years of age.
   Methods: Seventy-six children aged 60-72 months (36 preterm children

   enrolled in the study. Sensory processing was assessed using the Sensory
   Profile of Dunn, and school readiness was evaluated using the Marmara
   Primary School Readiness Scale.
   Results: Sensory processing scores of the preterm group were
   significantly lower than the term group (p<0.05) at five years of age.
   Sensory symptoms in preterm preschoolers were associated with school
   readiness (p<0.05). Total Sensory Profile score was a significant
   predictor for school readiness in preterms (p<0.05).
   Conclusion: Preterm children exhibited more sensory processing disorder
   than their term typical peers. Sensory processing disorders in preterm

Abstract = {{Objectives: Obesity has become an important public health problem
   because of its increasing prevalence and relation with many diseases and
   mortality. Studies have shown its association with oxidative stress. In
   this study, the effect of obesity on total amount of thiol and some
   glutathione S-transferase (GST) isozymes were investigated which could
   serve as an important criteria in dose adjustment of some certain drugs
   in obese.
   Methods: The gastric tissues removed by gastrectomy operation from 29
   morbid obese female patients were analysed for thiol levels and
   activities of total GST, GSTT1-1 and GSTM1-1. Patients were grouped
   according to age, presence of hypertension and/or diabetes, and family
   history.
   Results: The average total thiol was 131.22 (+/- 7.74) nmol/mg protein
   with no significant differences in between the groups. GSTT1 specific
   activities were about 20\% higher in four groups: with ages over 35
   years old, with hypertension, without diabetes and finally without
   family history, with respect to other groups. The differences between
   total GST and GSTM1 activity levels of experimental groups were not
   significant.
   Conclusions: This is the first study to compare activities of GST
   isozymes and total thiol content in the stomach tissues of obese female
   patients accompanying some common metabolic disorders, age and family

Abstract = {{In this work, albedo number, energy and dose of the perovskite films
   were determined by the gamma ray spectrometry. The MAPbBr(3-x)Cl(x),
   MAPbBr(3-x)I(x), MAPbl(3-x)Cl(x) and MAPbl(3) thin films were coated on
   the Pedot:PSS/ITO substrates by static spin coating technique. The
   structural properties of the films were determined with field emission
   scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images and X-ray diffraction (XRD)
   patterns. Albedo parameters of perovskite films were carried out by
   using a high purity germanium detector with a resolution of 182 eV at
   5.9 keV and 59.54 keV gamma-rays emitted from a radioactive source of
   Am-241 (59.54 keV). In XRF experiments, the scattering angle was set 168
   degrees. XRD patterns show that perovskite structure has forming
   tetragonal with high crystallinity. Also, the perovskite layer has
   compact and high coverage capability and uniform surface feature in
   terms of FE-SEM morphology. It is observed that albedo parameters are
   dependent on the density, the mean atomic number and the average band
   gap energy of perovskite films. Also, high energy radiation scattering
   from the perovskite films appears to be enhanced significantly with the
   MABr treatment.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{To obtain structural service reliability for a small sample of failure
   data, a reliability analysis method for a small sample of failure data
   based on the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
   algorithm, Bootstrap method, Bayesian estimation and hypothetical
   distribution check was proposed, and the feasibility of the method was
   verified. Taking the coupler body of a heavy-haul wagon as the research
   object, first, the fatigue bench test was carried out, and a small
   sample of the fatigue failure data for the coupler body under the given
   load spectrum was obtained. Then, the reliability analysis method for a
   small sample of failure data was used to analyze the coupler body
   failure data, and the curve of the coupler body reliability with failure
   mileage was finally obtained. The results show that the accuracy of the
   reliability curve based on the small sample analysis method is
   significantly higher than that based on sample size expansion and the
   empirical reliability of a small sample derived from random sampling
   based on an average rank calculation. When the reliability is 50\%, the
   service mileage of the coupler body is approximately 2.08 million km;
   when the reliability is 95\%, the service mileage is approximately 1.38
   million km; and when the reliability is 99\%, the service mileage is
   approximately 1.15 million km. The service reliability analysis method
   for a coupler body of a heavy-haul wagon based on the
   SMOTE-Bootstrap-Bayesian estimation has important theoretical and
   application value for improving the utilization rate of test data,
   reducing test costs and effectively evaluating the fatigue life of
   coupler bodies.}},

Title = {{A distributed-order time fractional derivative model for simulating
   bimodal sub-diffusion in heterogeneous media}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{591}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Bimodal transport due to dual-mobile advection or mass exchange between
   mobile and immobile zones has been widely observed for pollutants moving
   in heterogeneous media. Existing nonlocal transport models, however,
   cannot capture either heterogeneity in mobile domains or bi-peak
   concentration phenomena for breakthrough curves (BTCs) of solute
   transport in complex media. Therefore, this study proposed a dual
   heterogeneous domain model (DHDM) framework, conceptualized from the
   distributed-order time fractional derivative that incorporates a broader
   spectrum of particle movement in the dual-domain system than the
   classical single-domain model. A Lagrangian scheme was developed to
   solve the DHDM using the Bernoulli trial with the transition probability
   simulating mass exchange between different domains. Phase transition
   probabilities calculated based on the zeroth spatial moments of dual
   domain transport equations were used to simulate the particle
   partitioning between different domains. Applications to transport
   experiments in silt-clay columns conducted in our laboratory showed that
   the DHDM yielded significant improvement for simulating solute transport
   behavior compared to the single-domain anomalous transport model.
   Parameter analysis of the DHDM further revealed that the velocity
   disparity of the two domains controlled the BTC rising time and the
   shape of the second peak in the BTC. When the velocity of the slow
   domain is extremely small, the second BTC peak develops a `shoulder'
   characteristic during the late-time tail of the BTC. This study improved
   our understanding for bimodal transport in a dual domain system and
   provides a feasible tool for capturing a wide range of bimodal transport
   in complex media.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Achieving goal serum urate levels in patients with gout
   remains difficult in primary care and rheumatology practices. This study
   measured the ability of an asynchronous electronic visit (E-visit)
   program to facilitate achieving a goal serum urate (SU) of less than 6.0
   mg/dL.
   Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study in a large academic
   medical center rheumatology practice between April 1, 2017 and May 31,
   2018. Patients with gout and SU levels over 6.0 mg/dL were enrolled in
   an E-visit program and were compared with historical controls who
   received usual care, matched 1:1 for age and sex. The primary outcome of
   interest was the proportion of patients achieving SU target of less than
   6.0 mg/dL at six months.
   Results: Sixty-two patients were enrolled by their rheumatologist in the
   gout asynchronous E-visit program and were compared to 62 historical
   controls who were seen within one year prior to E-visit program
   initiation. Baseline characteristics including age, sex, body mass
   index, renal function, and initial SU were similar among patients
   enrolled in the E-visit program and controls. At six months, a
   significantly higher proportion of patients in the E-visit program
   achieved goal SU of less than 6.0 mg/dL compared to controls (63.8\% vs
   33.9\%, respectively, p < 0.01), and the E-visit patients had a lower
   mean SU level than historical controls (5.5 mg/dL versus 6.7 mg/dL,
   respectively, p < 0.01).
   Conclusion: A physician-initiated E-visit program led to a substantial
   improvement in the rate of achieving goal SU among patients with gout
   within an academic rheumatology practice. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Aims: Long-term functional outcomes after in-hospital cardiac arrest
   (IHCA) are scarcely studied. However, survivors are at risk of
   neurological impairment from anoxic brain damage which could affect
   quality of life and lead to need of care at home or in a nursing home.
   Methods: We linked data on ICHAs in Denmark with nationwide registries
   to report 30-day survival as well as factors associated with survival.
   Furthermore, among 30-day survivors we reported the one-year cumulative
   risk of anoxic brain damage or nursing home admission with mortality as
   the competing risk. Results: In total, 517 patients (27.3\%) survived to
   day 30 out of 1892 eligible patients; 338 (65.9\%) were men and median
   age was 68 (interquartile range 58-76). Lower age, witnessed arrest by
   health care personnel, monitored arrest and presumed cardiac cause of
   arrest were associated with 30 day survival. Among 454 30-day survivors
   without prior anoxic brain damage or nursing home admission, the risk of
   anoxic brain damage or nursing home admission within the first-year
   post-arrest was 4.6\% (n = 21; 95\% CI 2.7-6.6\%) with a competing risk
   of death of 15.6\% (n = 71; 95\% CI 12.3-19.0\%), leaving 79.7\% (n =
   362) alive without anoxic brain damage or nursing home admission. When
   adding the risk of need of in-home care among 343 30-day survivors
   without prior home care needs, 68.8\% (n = 236) were alive without any
   of the composite events one-year post-arrest. Conclusion: The majority
   of 30-day survivors of IHCA are alive at one-year follow-up without
   anoxic brain damage, nursing home admission or need of in-home care.}},

Abstract = {{A generation 1 poly(propylene thiophenoimine)-co-poly(ethylenedioxy
   thiophene) (G1PPT-co-PEDOT) star copolymer, which exhibits a strong
   optical absorption over a broad range in the ultraviolet-visible
   (UV-Vis) region and with good electro/conductive properties, was
   chemically prepared for the first time. Synthesis of the star copolymer,
   G1PPT-co-PEDOT was confirmed by spectroscopic studies. Indeed, the
   disappearance of the very high intensity bands, C-H bending at
   alpha-position (687 cm(-1)), and C=N stretching (1620 cm(-1)) in the
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of G1PPT-co-PEDOT, which
   were initially present in the spectrum of the thiolated starting
   material, G1PPT, confirmed copolymerization. Furthermore, a large
   bathochromic shift in the onset wavelength of the UV-Vis absorbance
   spectra from 367 nm in G1PPT to 674 nm in G1PPT-co-PEDOT further attests
   of successful copolymerization. The electrochemical analysis of
   G1PPT-co-PEDOT achieved a highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)
   energy level value of 5.3 eV, which is reminiscent of the value for an
   ideal electron-donor material. Photoluminescence quenching of up to 82\%
   was observed in solution blends of the G1PPT-co-PEDOT star copolymer and
   N,N `-diisopropyl naphthalene diimide (NDI). This demonstrates the
   occurrence of photoinduced intermolecular charge transfer (PICT) from
   the electron-donating G1PPT-co-PEDOT to the electron accepting NDI, a
   good property, beneficial for optoelectronic and photovoltaic
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose To examine the prevalence of sarcopenic obesity (SO) and its
   association with nutrition and lifestyle factors. Methods Data from the
   2008-2011 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for
   3937 Korean individuals aged 40 years or older with obesity defined by
   the modified Asia-Pacific criteria (BMI >= 25 kg/m(2)) were used.
   Sarcopenia was defined as an appendicular skeletal muscle mass divided
   by weight (\%) of < 1 SD below the sex-specific mean for young adults.
   Logistic regression models were used for the associations controlling
   covariates. Results The prevalence of SO was 52.5\%. The SO group had
   insufficient energy intake, protein, and antioxidant micronutrients, a
   lower overall dietary quality, a lower physical activity, and higher
   rates of negative psychological factors than the non-sarcopenic obesity
   group (p < 0.05). After controlling for covariates, having high mean
   adequacy ratio scores which was calculated by averaging the sum of the
   nutrient adequacy ratios had a 94\% lower prevalence of SO in the older
   individuals. Low participation in aerobic exercises had a 74\% higher
   prevalence of SO in the older aged group, and high participation in
   flexibility exercises had a 11\% lower prevalence of SO in the
   middle-aged group. Interestingly, negative psychological factors were
   found only in the middle-aged adults with SO (p < 0.05). Conclusion
   Sarcopenia was present in over half of the middle-aged and older Korean
   adults with obesity. Having high dietary quality, increased physical
   activity, and positive psychological health were associated with a low
   prevalence of SO.}},

Title = {{Surge analysis in a centrifugal compressor using a dimensionless surge

Abstract = {{Surge protection via the installation of an anti-surge control valve is
   indispensable in cen-trifugal compression systems, and the designs of
   such valves are often specified in the early design phase of centrifugal
   compression systems. However, additional recycle valve piping, such as
   hot or cold gas bypass valves, could be required in the case of
   emergency shutdowns. Furthermore, design verification via dynamic
   simulations is crucial in the engineering workflow. Because of the
   unavailability of design guidelines in the early design phase, only late
   verification is possible, necessitating system redesign when dynamic
   simulation results evidence the need for additional protection. This
   study presents a compressor surge distribution map by analyzing
   sensitivity parameters and establishing a new dimensionless number
   called the ``surge number{''} (Ns). The surge distribution map is used
   to classify the safe and unsafe areas for surge protection using
   numerical threshold values. The map is to be used as a preliminary
   guideline for surge protection for engineers to quickly review the
   system and take additional protection measures in the early phase of
   design. (c) 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by

Title = {{Co-optimizing water-alternating-carbon dioxide injection projects using
   a machine learning assisted computational framework}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{279}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{In this article, a robust machine-learning-based computational framework
   that couples multi-layer neural network (MLNN) proxies and a
   multi-objective particle swarm optimizer (MOPSO) to design
   water-alternating carbon dioxide injection (CO2-WAG) projects is
   presented. The proposed optimization protocol considers various
   objectives, including oil recovery and CO2 storage volume. Expert MLNN
   systems are trained and employed as surrogate models of the
   high-fidelity compositional simulator in the optimization workflow. When
   multiple objective functions are considered, two approaches are employed
   to treat the objectives: the weighted sum method and the
   Pareto-front-based scheme. A field-scale implementation focusing on
   tertiary recovery in the Morrow B formation at Farnsworth Unit (FWU) is
   presented. The developed Pareto-optimal solutions indicate the maximal
   available oil production can be 1.64 x 10(7) barrels and maximal carbon
   storage can achieve 2.35 x 10(7) tons. Trade-offs factor is defined to
   divide the constructed Pareto front into 4 sections with the trade-off
   factors' value ranges from 0.35 to 49.9. This work also compares the
   optimum solution found by the aggregative objective function and the
   solution repository covered by the Pareto front that considers the
   physical and operational constraints and reduces uncertainties involved
   by the multi-objective optimization process. Our comparison indicates
   multiple solutions exist to satisfy the objective criteria of the WAG
   design, and these results cannot be found using the traditional weighted
   sum method. The Pareto front solution can provide more options for
   project designers, but decisions regarding necessary trade-offs must be
   made using the solution repository to balance the project economics and
   CO2 storage amount.}},

Title = {{The effect of a shelf placement intervention on sales of healthier and
   less healthy breakfast cereals in supermarkets: A co-designed pilot
   study}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL SCIENCE \& MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{266}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Supermarkets are the principal source of grocery food in many
   high-income countries. Choice architecture strategies show promise to
   improve the healthiness of food choices. A retailer-academic
   collaboration was formed to co-design and pilot selected commercially
   sustainable strategies to increase sales of healthier foods relative to
   less healthy foods in supermarkets. Two co-design workshops, involving
   supermarket corporate staff and public health nutrition academics,
   identified potential interventions. One intervention, more prominent
   shelf placement of healthier products within one category (breakfast
   cereals), was selected for testing. A pilot study (baseline,
   intervention and follow-up, 12-weeks each) was undertaken in six
   supermarkets (three intervention and three control) in Auckland, New
   Zealand. Products were ranked by nutrient levels and profile, and after
   accounting for the supermarkets' space management principles, healthier
   products were placed at adult eye level. The primary outcome was change
   in sales of healthier products relative to total category sales.
   Secondary outcomes were nutrient profile of category sales, in-store
   product promotions, customer perceptions, and retailer feedback. There
   was no difference in proportional sales of more prominently positioned
   healthier products between intervention (56\%) and control (56\%) stores
   during the intervention. There were no differences in the nutrient
   profile of category sales. A higher proportion of less healthy breakfast
   cereals were displayed in intervention versus control stores (57\% vs
   43\%). Most customers surveyed supported shelf placement as a strategy
   (265, 88\%) but noted brand preferences and price were more salient
   determinants of purchases. Retailers were similarly supportive but
   balancing profit, health/nutrition and customer satisfaction was
   challenging. Shelf placement alone was not an effective strategy to
   increase purchases of healthier breakfast cereals. This study showed
   co-design of a healthy eating intervention with a commercial retailer is
   feasible, but concurrent retail environment factors likely limited the
   public health impact of the intervention.}},

Abstract = {{Phenoloxidase system is a crucial component of insect innate immunity
   which contribute to oxidize phenols to quinones and to generate reactive
   oxygen and nitrogen intermediates. In the current study, a phenoloxidase
   (PO) was extracted by hemocyte lysate preparation and purified through
   ammonium sulfate precipitation, Sepharyl G-100, and DEAE-Cellulose fast
   flow columns. At the end of the purification process, an enzyme was
   purified with a specific activity of 0.462 U/mg protein, recovery of
   40.47\%, purification fold of 14.43 and molecular weight of similar to
   78.7 kDa. The optimal activity was recorded at pH 7 while the optimal
   temperature was recorded at 30-35 degrees C, 35 degrees C and 25-35
   degrees C, using L-dihydroxyphenylalanine, hydroquinone, and
   pyrocatechol, respectively. The highest V-max of PO was obtained using
   L-dopa while the lowest K-m value was gained using hydroquinone. Among
   used synthetic inhibitors of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA),
   diethyldithiocarbamate (DTC), N, N,N0,N0-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) and
   triethylenetetramine hexaacetic acid (TTHA), EDTA and DTC inhibited more
   than 60\% of the enzyme activity. Moreover, an endogenous phenoloxidase
   inhibitor (POI) was purified by twice processing of Sepharyl G-100
   chromatography with the molecular weight of similar to 52 kDa. The IC50
   of POI was found 31.3 mg against the purified PO of C. perspectalis and
   led to a higher value of K-m. Finally, larval injection by DTC and POI
   demonstrated significant inhibition of PO over the time of exposure. A
   comprehensive understanding of insect's POs may better clarify the ways
   of their survival within infected areas and to potentially target them
   by specific and selective compounds.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives To evaluate the association between pelvic floor dimensions
   in nulliparous women at term and fetal head engagement, as assessed by
   transperineal ultrasound.
   Methods This was a prospective observational study of nulliparous women
   at term. Before the onset of labor, transperineal ultrasound was used to
   measure the anteroposterior diameter (APD) of the levator hiatus and the
   angle of progression (AoP) at rest, on maximum pelvic floor muscle
   contraction and on maximum Valsalva maneuver (before and after visual
   feedback). We assessed the correlation between pelvic floor static and
   dynamic dimensions (levator hiatal APD and levator ani muscle
   coactivation) and AoP, which is an objective index of fetal head
   engagement.
   Results In total, 282 women were included in the analysis. Among these,
   211 (74.8\%) women had a vaginal delivery while 71 (25.2\%) had a
   Cesarean delivery. AoP was narrower in the Cesarean-delivery group at
   rest, on maximum pelvic floor muscle contraction and on maximum
   Valsalva, whereas no differences in levator hiatal APD were found
   between the two groups. We found a negative correlation between levator
   hiatal APD at rest, on maximum pelvic floor muscle contraction and on
   maximum Valsalva and the duration of the second stage of labor. There
   was a positive correlation between AoP and levator hiatal APD on maximum
   Valsalva maneuver after visual feedback (r=0.15, P=0.01). Women with
   levator ani muscle contraction on Valsalva maneuver (i.e. coactivation),
   both pre and post visual feedback, had a narrower AoP at rest and on
   maximum Valsalva. After visual feedback, women with levator ani muscle
   coactivation had a longer second stage of labor than did those without
   (80.8 +/- 61.4 min vs 62.9 +/- 43.4 min (P=0.04)).
   Conclusions Smaller pelvic floor dimensions and levator ani muscle
   coactivation are associated with higher fetal head station and with a
   longer second stage of labor in nulliparous women at term. Copyright (C)

Title = {{Performance Analysis of Cache Based on Popularity and Class in Named
   Data Network}},
Journal = {{FUTURE INTERNET}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The communication network is growing with some unique characteristics,
   such as consumers repeatedly request the same content to the server,
   similarity in local demand trend, and dynamic changes to requests within
   a specific period. Therefore, a different network paradigm is needed to
   replace the IP network, namely Named Data Network (NDN). The content
   store, which acts as a crucial component in the NDN nodes is a limited
   resource. In addition, a cache mechanism is needed to optimize the
   router's content store by exploiting the different content services
   characters in the network. This paper proposes a new caching algorithm
   called Cache Based on Popularity and Class (CAPIC) with dynamic
   mechanism, and the detail explanation about the static method also
   presented. The goal of Static-CAPIC was to enhance the total cache hit
   ratio on the network by pre-determining the cache proportion for each
   content class. However, this technique is not appropriate to control the
   cache hit ratio for priority class. Therefore, the Dynamic-CAPIC is used
   to provide flexibility to change the cache proportion based on the
   frequency of requests in real-time. The formula involves considering the
   consumers' request all the time. It gives a higher cache hit ratio for
   the priority content class. This method outperforms Static-CAPIC, and
   the LCD+sharing scheme in the total network cache hit ratio parameter
   and channels it to the priority class.}},

Abstract = {{In composite liners made of geomembrane (GMB)-geosynthetics clay liners
   (GCLs), maintaining bentonite in the GCL in a suitably hydrated state is
   critical for their performance. Hydration of GCL from subsoil, following
   industry best practice, is time consuming and conditional on suitable
   water chemistry in subsoil. In addition, under thermal gradients,
   dehydration occurs, with moisture migrating downwards to the subsoil,
   leading to the development of cracks in the bentonite and hence loss of
   performance.\textbackslash{}
   Two novel ideas are proposed in this paper, namely hydration of GCLs by
   artificial irrigation and hydraulic separation of the liner system from
   the underlying subsoil. Three new composite liner designs allowing for
   actively irrigating a geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) through a
   geocomposite layer were investigated. In two of the three designs, the
   hydraulic connection between the GCL and the subsoil was broken by
   placing an additional GMB between them. The new designs were tested in
   column experiments under 20 kPa overburden pressure and temperatures of
   up to 78 degrees C applied to the top of the liner. The performances of
   the new designs were compared to that of a standard GCL-GMB design where
   GCL was allowed to hydrate from a well-graded sandy subsoil. Three
   scenarios for the staging of hydration and thermal load application were
   investigated.
   Under active hydration of the composite liners, it took less than 14
   days for the GCLs to reach a gravimetric water content omega of
   110-130\%, compared to 49 days taken to reach omega similar to 95\%
   under hydration from the subsoil. GCLs in the new designs in which the
   hydraulic connection with the subsoil was broken, remained well-hydrated
   (omega>100\%) after 14 days of heating and no cracks appeared in the
   bentonite. On the other hand, the GCL in the conventional design
   experienced severe desiccation under the same conditions. The new
   designs hence offer a viable solution to the problem of slow hydration
   and/or thermal desiccation of GCLs.}},

Abstract = {{If the operating voltage of anode materials is below 1.0 V versus
   Li+/Li, the side reaction between electrolyte and anode materials will
   occur extensively. Thus, high-voltage anode materials have aroused
   interest recently. In this work, we report the preparation of PNb9O25
   nanofiber via a facile electrospinning method. The PNb9O25 nanofiber
   shows the high rate performance and excellent cycling performance when
   it is used as anode in lithium ions batteries. For instance, the PNb9O25
   nanofiber can deliver a capacity of 233, 212.1, 193.8, and 181.4 mA h
   g(-1) at 0.2, 1, 3, and 6C, respectively. After 1000 cycles, it can
   reach at 134.3 mA h g(-1) with capacity retention of 70.9\%. Meanwhile,
   the ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy technique has been adopted
   to investigate the evolution in valence state of each element for
   PNb9O25 nanofiber. In addition, the PNb9O25 nanofiber is chosen as the
   anode material in lithium ion full cell in this work, demonstrating the
   potential for practical application. (C) 2020 The Chinese Ceramic

   Asymmetric Spatial Heterodyne Spectrometer and Correction Method}},
Journal = {{ACTA PHOTONICA SINICA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{The doppler asymmetric spatial heterodyne interferometer can be used to
   retrieve the atmospheric wind speed by measuring the phase frequency
   shift of interference fringes. Because of the interference from cosmic
   rays and ``hot pixels{''} in CCD, some spikes that have random location
   and intensity occur on the interferogram. The presence of such spikes
   can seriously affect the accuracy of wind speed retrieval. In this
   paper,the theoretical influence of various parameters of spike on the
   phase inversion accuracy of doppler asymmetric spatial heterodyne
   interferometer is discussed,and the spike correction method is proposed.
   Based on the characteristics of the spike and the phase retrieval model
   of doppler asymmetric spatial heterodyne interferometer,a theoretical
   model between the phase error and the intensity and position of the
   spike is established. The influence of the intensity, position and width
   of the spike on the phase retrieval accuracy is analyzed and verified by
   experiments. The results show that the phase retrieval error varies
   periodically with the position of the spike,and is positively correlated
   with the intensity and peak width of spike. A new method of spike
   correction based on nearest neighbor comparison and windowed median
   filter is proposed. The new method can effectively correct the spike
   without affecting the original interference data. The phase error caused
   by the spike after correction is reduced by more than 90\%, which will
   help to improve the accuracy of subsequent interference data processing.}},

Title = {{A discontinuous isogeometric reanalysis method and its application in
   closed-loop optimization problems}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{150}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this study, a DisContinuous IsoGeometric Reanalysis (DCIGR) method is
   proposed to analyze and optimize the model of Non-Uniform Rational
   B-Splines (NURBS) patches with non-matching interfaces. In the DCIGR,
   the Nitsche method is adapted to couple NURBS patches with gaps and the
   smooth algorithm is developed to correct singular stresses resulting
   from gaps. However, the additional stiffness matrices (interfacial
   stiffness matrices) must be calculated when using the Nitsche method,
   which will inevitably increase the computational cost. Therefore,
   Combined Approximation (CA) is introduced to reduce the computational
   cost of the optimization. Theoretically, the larger and more complex a
   problem is, the more efficient the DCIGR will be. Moreover, since the
   modifications of the model can be accurately represented by the IGA, the
   proposed method can be easily integrated with the closed-loop
   optimization. Compared with existing methods for non-matching
   interfaces, the DCIGR fully takes the advantage of the IGA and achieves
   the fast optimization based on the CA. Numerical examples are given to
   verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Constructing 3D graphene frameworks with ultra-thickness and rich ion
   transport paths is of great significance for the practical application
   of graphene supercapacitors. Herein, 3D porous graphene frameworks, with
   thickness up to 320 mu m, are directly grown by laser induction on the
   synthesized polyimide by optimizing the thermal sensitivity of polyimide
   to increase laser penetration depth. Simultaneously, hierarchical pores
   are obtained due to fast liberation of gaseous products during laser
   radiation, which facilitates fast ion transport. Coupled with its
   conductive interconnection network, the as-prepared 3D graphene delivers
   a high specific capacitance of 132.2 mF cm(-2) at 0.5 mA cm(-2), which
   is nearly one order of magnitude larger than that of most reported laser
   induced graphene electrodes. Pseudocapacitive polypyrrole is further
   introduced into the gra-phene frameworks to prepare composite
   electrodes, which show specific capacitances as high as 2412.2 mF cm(-2)
   at 0.5 mA cm(-2). Accordingly, flexible solid-state
   micro-supercapacitors are constructed, with a high energy density of
   134.4 mu W h cm(-2) at a power density of 325 mu W cm(-2). Furthermore,
   95.6\% of initial capacitance is retained after 10,000 cycles,
   indicating superior cycling stability. These results suggest that the
   ultra-thick hierarchical porous graphene frameworks have promising
   prospects for high-performance flexible microsupercapacitors.}},

Abstract = {{Antarctic krill is a nutrient-rich crustacean that is one of the main
   species in the Antarctic ecosystem. Antarctic krill shell (AKS) can be
   used as raw materials to prepare chitin. In this study, lactic acid and
   dispase were used to prepare Antarctic krill chitin (AKC-1).
   Amino-monosaccharide contents of chitin samples were detected by
   pre-column PMP-HPLC method. Analytical instruments were conducted to
   determine characteristics of chitin samples. Results showed that the
   amino-monosaccharide content of AKS was 4.62 g/100 g (measured in
   D-glucosamine). The yield of AKC-1 was 5.49 g/100 g, and the
   amino-monosaccharide content was 80.90 g/100 g. AKC-1 showed smooth
   flakes, a porous surface, and alpha-chitin structural characteristics.
   The maximum degradation temperature (DTG(max)) was 318.3 degrees C. The
   yield of deacetylated chitin (AKC-2) was 4.74 g/100 g, with
   deacetylation degree of 80.8\%, viscosity average molecular weight of
   approximately 145.7 kDa, and amino-monosaccharide content of 97.06 g/100
   g. The surface morphology of AKC-2 was similar to that of AKC-1, and the
   DTG(max) was 311.5 degrees C. A mild, eco-friendly chitin preparation
   method and an amino-monosaccharide content detection method of raw
   material before chitin preparation are described in this study, which
   can provide technical support for comprehensive utilization of Antarctic
   krill resources. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Photonic integrated circuits are an ideal platform for chip-scale
   computation and communication. A complex photonic network usually
   requires components to direct light from one waveguide to another that
   is parallel to the former with an arbitrary separation d. Traditionally,
   this is achieved with S-shaped waveguide bends, which either occupy a
   large footprint or suffer from large insertion loss. To reduce the
   footprint and maintain ultralow insertion loss, here we propose and
   experimentally demonstrate inverse-designed photonic jumpers on a
   silicon-on-insulator platform. These photonic jumpers have ultracompact
   sizes by achieving the expected function within a footprint of d x 2.5
   mu m, while the simulated and measured insertion loss for the
   fundamental transverse-electricmodemaintains below 0.14 and 0.30 dB,
   respectively, in the wavelength range of 1.50-1.60 mu m. Therefore,
   these photonic jumpers can be used in large-scale photonic integrated
   circuits as a standard module to significantly enhance the integration
   density.}},

Abstract = {{The in vitro digestive and fermentation properties of Sargassum pallidum
   polysaccharide (SPP) after ultrasound degradation were investigated. The
   results showed that SPP and its degraded fractions were not affected by
   human saliva, but slightly degraded by breaking glycosidic bonds under
   simulated gastrointestinal digestion. The DPPH radical scavenging
   activity, alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity, and bile acid-binding
   capacity of SPP and its degraded fractions were decreased after
   digestion, which was attributed to the reduction of molecular weights
   (MWs) and viscosity. Furthermore, in vitro fermentation assay indicated
   that SPP and its degraded fractions showed good fermentability. The
   predominant compositional monosaccharides including arabinose,
   galactose, glucose, xylose, and uronic acid were significantly
   decreased, and the degraded SPP fractions were more easily fermented and
   utilized by gut bacteria. SPP and its degraded fractions could modulate
   gut health by decreasing the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and
   increasing the relative abundances of some beneficial genera, such as
   Prevotella, Dialister, Phascolarctobacterium, Ruminococcus, and
   Bacteroides. These findings suggested that SPP and its degraded
   fractions exhibited similar influence on gut microbiota community, but
   appropriate degraded SPP fractions were more easily fermented by gut
   microbiota. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Most research into ethical leadership depends on Western corporate
   experience, however current research findings may not fit the Chinese
   context. As a result, it is necessary to appeal to indigenous and
   traditional Chinese sources of wisdom when defining and evaluating
   ethical leadership in China. Both rule-following ethics and instrumental
   approaches, which are mainly used in recent empirical studies about
   ethical leadership, cannot enable people to have inner motivation to
   behave ethically. Accordingly, this article intends to establish an
   ethical leadership model in China by appealing to Confucian virtue
   ethics. A Confucian ethical leader possesses benevolence (ren) inside
   and treats others in a proper way according to ritual and rites (li).
   He/she makes self-cultivation as the first priority and is a virtuous
   role model, influencing others in a natural way by of his/her moral
   charisma. For such a person, economic profitableness is not a primary
   concern, where instead the goals, strategies and practices of his/her
   organization are defined by the principle of righteousness (yi).}},

Abstract = {{Lithium-ion batteries are currently the most suitable power source for

   lithium-ion batteries tend to thermal runaway when the temperature of
   external heat source is higher than a certain value. During this period,
   the most important thermal reaction is the reaction between anode and

Abstract = {{Effective communication forges the dentist-patient treatment alliance
   and is thus essential for providing person-centred care. Social rank
   theory suggests that shame, trust, communication and anxiety are linked
   together, they are moderated by socio-economic position. The study is
   aimed to propose and test an explanatory model to predict dental
   attendance behaviours using person-centred and socio-economic position
   factors. A secondary data analysis was conducted on a cross-sectional
   representative survey of a two-stage cluster sample of adults including
   England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Data were drawn from structured
   interview. Path analysis of proposed model was calculated following
   measurement development and confirmation of reliable constructs. The
   findings show model fit was good. Dental anxiety was predicted
   negatively by patient's trust and positively by reported dentist
   communication. Patient's shame was positively associated with dental
   anxiety, whereas self-reported dental attendance was negatively
   associated with dental anxiety. Both patient's trust and dentist's
   communication effects were moderated by social class. Manual classes
   were most sensitive to the reported dentist's communications. Some
   evidence for the proposed model was found. The relationships reflected
   in the model were illuminated further when social class was introduced
   as moderator and indicated dentists should attend to communication
   processes carefully across different categories of patients.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, seawater heavy metal concentrations (Al, As, Cu, Ba, Zn,
   Fe, Cd, Co, Cr, Pb, Mn, Mo and Ni) measured by ICP-OES and water quality
   parameters (NH4-N, NO3-, N, NO3, PO4-P, PO4-3, suspended solids,
   temperature, conductivity, pH and dissolved oxygen) were evaluated in
   Izmit Bay (The Marmara Sea). The study was carried out seasonally
   between December 2016 and September 2017 at four separate sampling
   stations. The mean concentrations of heavy metals in mg L-1 were: Al:
   0.074, As: 0.020, Cu: 0.020, Ba: 0.043, Zn: 0.091, Fe: 0.253, Cd: 0.010,
   Co: 0.022, Cr: 0.010, Pb: 0.010, Mn: 0.291, Mo: 0.013 and Ni: 0.014. The
   mean annual value of water quality parameters were: NH4-N: 0.19, NO3-N:
   1.79, NO3-: 8.16, PO4-P: 0.20, PO4-3: 0.37, suspended solids:16.61 mg
   L-1, temperature: 16.47 degrees C, conductivity: 38.19 mu S/cm, pH: 7.52
   and dissolved oxygen: 9.52 mg L-1. Generally, when the physical and
   chemical parameters measured at the sampling stations were evaluated
   according to above-ground water quality regulation, the water quality
   was Class II, as defined by national regulations. The correlation
   between physico-chemical parameters and heavy metals measured at the
   research stations was investigated. There was a negative correlation
   between NO3- and both Cu and Mn (p<0.05). There was also a positive
   correlation between suspended solids and As (p<0.05). concentrations of
   Fe and Mn values were found to be high at the 2st and 4nd stations. This
   is probably due to the fact that there are many maritime port facilities
   around the stations and intensive port transportation. Other heavy metal
   concentrations were found to be in accordance with the criteria..}},

Abstract = {{Premixed combustion of lean methane-air in an artificial porous media
   burner with staggered alumina cylinders was experimentally and
   numerically performed. Numerical simulations were conducted at gas
   mixture velocities of 0.43-0.86 m/s and equivalence ratios of 0.162 and
   0.243, respectively. Through comparison with experimental results,
   temperature distribution, peak temperature and flame propagation
   velocity are analyzed and discussed in detail. The numerical calculated
   temperature profile over the axis of the combustor coincided well with
   test data in the post-flame zone, however a certain deviation was found
   in the preheated zone. A two-dimensional flame shape was observed and
   the flame thickness was the size of cylinder diameter. The peak
   temperature increased with the gas mixture inlet velocity at the certain
   equivalence ratio, and its peak value was about 1.8-2.16 times higher
   than the adiabatic combustion temperature under the desired equivalence
   ratio, which indicates that super-adiabatic combustion was the case for
   all the numerical simulations. The flame propagating velocity had a
   positive correlation with the gas mixture inlet velocity.}},

Abstract = {{Small grains of platinum group minerals (PGMs) have been found in
   chromitites of the Ergaksky and Kalninsky ultramafic massifs, which are
   marginal northeastern fragments of the Kurtushiba ophiolite belt in
   Western Sayan. Along with previously described PGMs, the Cu-Ru-Os solid
   solution, arsenic-bearing (As up to 3.6 wt \%) laurite with minor Pt,
   Ni, and Co, platinum group element (PGE) sulfides of the MeS and Me3S4
   types, sulfoarsenide with the high Rh content (12.7 wt \%) in
   chromitites of the Ergaksky massif, and laurite and sulfoarsenides in
   chromitites of the Kalninsky massif were found for the first time. The
   PGM compositions indicate a high formation temperature of Ru-Os sulfide
   (1200-1250 degrees C) in both massifs, as well as a high partial sulfur
   pressure during the formation of chromitites and syngenetic PGMs in the
   Ergaksky massif. The PGM assemblages were formed during several stages.
   The Os-Ir-Ru alloys and the laurite-erlichmanite series disulfides
   (predominantly partitioning Ru) are early; the Cu-Ru-Os alloys, sulfides
   (Ru,Fe)(3)S-4, (Ru,Ni,Fe)S, and PGE sulfoarsenides are late and were
   crystallized under the influence of reductive fluids as a result of PGE
   remobilization and redeposition.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Reports on the correlation between the expression of
   Survivin/phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) proteins and clinical
   factors in gastric cancer (GC) are varied, and the sample sizes were
   also not sufficient. The present study aimed to detect the expression of
   Survivin and PTEN proteins in GC patients on the basis of a greater
   number of specimens and to analyze the correlation with clinical
   features and survival. The results revealed that the Survivin expression
   rates in GC, normal tissues and metastatic lymph nodes were 72\%
   (232/322), 5\% (6/120) and 80\% (36/45), respectively, while the PTEN
   expression rates were 34\% (109/322), 92.5\% (111/120) and 24.4\%
   (11/45), respectively, and the differences between cancer and normal
   tissue or metastatic lymph nodes were significant for both proteins
   (P<0.05). The expression of Survivin was significantly associated with
   gross type, depth of invasion, distant metastasis, tumor, necrosis and
   metastasis (TNM) stage and vascular invasion, while PTEN expression was
   predominantly associated with age, tumor size, invasion depth, TNM stage
   and lymphatic invasion in GC patients (P<0.05). The expression of both
   was associated with postoperative metastasis and metastatic site
   (P=0.007 and P=0.011 for Survivin, and P=0.002 and P=0.005 for PTEN).
   There was a negative association between the expression levels of
   Survivin and PTEN (P=0.001, r=-0.524). The expression levels of both
   were also associated with prognosis. The expression of Survivin and PTEN
   protein exhibit opposing trends in GC, which may indicate adverse
   biological effects in the occurrence of GC. The Survivin and PTEN
   expression levels are likely to be an important molecular event in
   gastric tumorigenesis and may be considered as molecular markers of GC
   progression and reliable prognostic indicators of GC.}},

Abstract = {{Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) leaflets (OPLs) are one of the major
   agricultural by-products generated from the massive cultivation of
   Malaysian palm oil. This biomass is also reported to be of potential
   value based on its health-improving effects. By employing proton nuclear
   magnetic resonance (H-1-NMR) spectroscopy combined with multivariate
   data analysis (MVDA), the metabolite profile of OPLs was characterized
   and correlated with their antioxidant and wound healing properties.
   Principal component analysis (PCA) classified four varieties of
   extracts, prepared using solvents ranging from polar to medium polarity,
   into three distinct clusters. Cumulatively, six flavonoids, eight
   organic acids, four carbohydrates, and an amine were identified from the
   solvent extracts. The more polar extracts, such as, the ethyl
   acetate-methanol, absolute methanol, and methanol-water, were richer in
   phytochemicals. Based on partial least square (PLS) analysis, the
   constituents in these extracts, such as (+)-catechin, (-)-epicatechin,
   orientin, isoorientin, vitexin, and isovitexin, were strongly correlated
   with the measured antioxidant activities, comprising ferric reducing
   antioxidant power (FRAP), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and
   nitric oxide (NO) free radical scavenging activities, as well as with
   cell proliferation and migration activities. This study has provided
   crucial evidence on the importance of these natural antioxidant
   compounds on the wound healing properties of OPL.}},

Abstract = {{This study delivers new empirical evidence on the impact of banking
   regulations on the levels of social and financial efficiency of
   microfinance institutions (MFIs) between the years 2012 to 2018. The
   sample consisted of data from 172 MFIs from ASEAN-5 countries. As the
   first stage of the analysis, data envelopment analysis (DEA) was
   employed to determine a score of the level of social and financial
   efficiency for the sampled MFIs. Meanwhile, panel regression analysis
   and the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator were used to
   examine the impact of banking regulations on the level of social and
   financial efficiency of the sampled MFIs. The findings showed that the
   sampled MFIs achieved a lower level of social efficiency while attaining
   a higher level of financial efficiency. The lower level of social
   efficiency indicated that the sampled MFIs had lost their focus on
   poverty reduction, while at the same time, switching their focus toward
   financial sustainability. The empirical findings also showed a
   significant impact of bank regulation and bank supervision on the levels
   of social and financial efficiency. Overall, bank regulation negatively
   influenced the level of social efficiency and bank supervision impacted
   the level of financial efficiency of the sampled MFIs positively. The
   findings from this study provide new insights for bank regulators and
   policymakers to construct regulatory frameworks that are relevant to the
   operation of MFIs.}},

Abstract = {{TiO2-ZnO binary heterojunctions with different molar ratios of TiO2 to
   ZnO have been prepared via a two-step co-precipitation method, including
   the synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) and then incorporating them
   into the ZnO matrix. Structural studies and elemental analysis have been
   carried out by a series of characterization techniques including X-ray
   diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission
   electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer. The linear
   optical characteristics have been investigated using photoluminescence
   emission spectra at an excitation wavelength of 300 nm to estimate
   various energy states formed in crystalline structures. The optical
   nonlinearities of synthesized NPs have been tested by nanosecond laser
   pulse-based single-beam Z-scan technique. Closed-aperture and
   open-aperture Z-scan measurements have shown negative lens effects and
   reverse saturable absorption behaviours for as-synthesized composite
   nanostructures, respectively. The third-order susceptibilities of
   TiO2-ZnO nanocomposites have been estimated to be higher than that of
   pristine TiO2 NPs with a maximum value of 4.8 x 10(-4) esu belonging to
   the sample with a 1:1 molar ratio of TiO2 to ZnO.}},

Abstract = {{Many evidence confirms that amyloid beta 1-42 fragment (A beta(1-42))
   causes neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and cell death, which are
   related to progressive memory loss, cognitive impairments and mental
   disorders that will lead to Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression.
   Netrin-1, as a member of the laminins, has been proved to inhibit
   apoptosis and inflammation outside of nervous system, in addition to
   having a vital role in morphogenesis and neurogenesis of neural system.
   This study was designed to assess the protective effects of netrin-1 in
   SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line exposed to A beta(1-42) and to
   explore some mechanisms that underlie netrin-1 effects. Cultured SH-SY5Y
   neuroblast-like cells were treated with netrin-1 prior to A beta(1-42)
   exposure and the effects were assessed by MTT and ELISA assay kits.
   Netrin- 1 pretreatment of A beta(1-42) exposed SH-SY5Y human
   neuroblastoma cells attenuated A beta(1-42) induced toxic effects,
   increased cell viability and partially restored levels of 3 inflammatory
   and oxidative stress biomarkers including: nuclear factor erythroid
   2-like 2 (Nrf2), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and nuclear
   factor kappa-light chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappa B).
   Based on the findings of this study, netrin-1 represents a promising
   therapeutic bio agent to abrogate cellular inflammation and reactive
   oxygen species (ROS) activation induced by A beta(1-42) in the SH-SY5Y
   cell model of AD.}},

Title = {{Analytical and Clinical Validation of a New Immunoenzymatic Method for
   the Measurement of Canine Parathyroid Hormone}},
Journal = {{ANIMALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Simple Summary
   In dogs affected with chronic kidney disease (CKD), mineral disorders,
   including renal hyperparathyroidism (RHPT), are frequent. Secondary RHPT
   is the increase in serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), that can have a
   significant impact in the disease progression. Despite its clinical
   utility, the measurement of serum PTH is not routinely executed due to
   limited availability of validated methods. The aims of this study were:
   the analytical validation of a new method for PTH measurement in dogs
   and analysis of the preliminary association of the obtained results with
   the renal status. Twenty-seven samples obtained from dogs that were
   healthy or affected with CKD were analysed. PTH was measured using a
   commercially available human assay. The precision and accuracy of this
   method were assessed and the PTH stability at different temperatures was
   evaluated. Clinical validation was performed by comparing PTH values
   with clinicopathological parameters often altered during CKD, such as
   creatinine and phosphorus, and with the disease severity. The method
   showed an optimal precision and accuracy; the stability was compatible
   with the standard sample processing times. PTH was positively associated
   with creatinine and phosphorus. The investigated method was successfully
   validated in dogs, allowing its use for clinical purposes.
   Renal hyperparathyroidism (RHPT) is one of the main complications in
   dogs affected with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). The measurement of
   serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) could be of clinical utility for the
   disease's treatment and follow-up; however, PTH is not routinely
   determined due to limited available methods, often not fully validated
   in dogs. The aims of this study were the analytical validation of an
   immunoenzymatic method for the measurement of PTH in canine serum and
   the analysis of preliminary association of the obtained results with
   renal function. Twenty-six samples obtained from dogs healthy or
   affected with CKD were analysed. PTH was measured using a two-site
   immunoenzymometric human assay (ST AIA-PACK(R) Intact PTH, Tosoh
   Bioscience). The analytical validation protocol evaluated the assay
   precision and accuracy. Also, the PTH's storage stability at 20 degrees
   C, 4 degrees C and -20 degrees C was assessed. Clinical validation was
   performed by comparing PTH values with creatinine, phosphorus and
   International Renal Interest Society (IRIS) stage. The method showed
   optimal precision and accuracy, whereas stability was adequate up to 4 h
   at 20 degrees C, 24 h at 4 degrees C and 6 months at -20 degrees C. PTH
   was positively associated with creatinine, phosphorus and IRIS stage.
   The investigated method was thus successfully validated in dogs,
   allowing its use for clinical purpose.}},

Title = {{The anatomic basis for ultrasound in the diagnosis and treatment of
   styloid process-related diseases}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: The styloid process (SP), stylohyoid ligament and lesser
   horn of hyoid bone together form the stylohyoid chain. Differences in
   the ossification degree and the connection sites of each segment of the
   stylohyoid chain on both sides lead to variations in the length,
   orientation, thickness, and straightness of SP. The incidence of
   elongation of the SP, known as styloid process syndrome (SPS), is around
   4\%, with only 4\% of patients showing elongation show symptoms.
   Computed tomography (CT) remains the first-choice auxiliary examination
   for diagnosing SPS, but its performance can be affected by a variety of
   factors. Ultrasound can reveal the parapharyngeal space and adjacent
   structures, which offer high consistency with CT findings. Here, we
   investigated the ultrasonographic features of the SP and its adjacent
   structures in normal adults and assessed the clinical utility of
   ultrasound assessment for SP-related diseases.
   Methods: With the ramus of mandible, mastoid process, SP, and salivary
   gland as the anatomical landmarks, ultrasonography was conducted on the
   parapharyngeal space in 78 healthy adults. The scans were performed
   along the oblique coronal section of the ramus and the cross-sectional
   plane between the mastoid process and ramus to visualize the SP and its
   adjacent structures. The SP length, the shortest distance from the SP
   tip to the outer edge of tonsil (SP-tonsil distance), and the distance
   from SP to the internal carotid artery (SP-ICA distance) were measured.
   Results: SP and its adjacent structures were successfully visualized on
   ultrasonography in all 78 subjects. The measured SP length was 2.65 +/-
   0.48 cm. The SP-tonsil distance was 1.95 +/- 0.50 cm. The SP-ICA
   distance was 0.509 +/- 0.231 cm. The SP length and SP-tonsil distance
   measured by ultrasound were not significantly different from those
   measured by CT (P=0.071, P=0.053). Furthermore, the SP length and
   SP-tonsil distance measured by ultrasound were positively correlated
   with CT measurements (r=0.917, P=0.071; r=0.978, P=0.053, respectively).
   SP-tonsil distance was negatively correlated with SP length and SP
   inward deflection angle.
   Conclusions: Ultrasound can accurately reveal the shape and size of SP
   and its adjacent structures and thus will be helpful for the diagnosis
   of SP-related diseases.}},

   into labour markets and their limited and fragmented access to and
   exercise of health, housing, and other social rights. The evidence
   points to a significant deterioration in their livelihoods and social
   inclusion, and potential profound changes in (im)mobility regimes caused

Journal = {{MATHEMATICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{One class of differential games with random duration is considered. It
   is assumed that the duration of the game is a random variable with
   values from a given finite interval. The cumulative distribution
   function (CDF) of this random variable is assumed to be discontinuous
   with two jumps on the interval. It follows that the player's payoff
   takes the form of the sum of integrals with different but adjoint time
   intervals. In addition, the first interval corresponds to the zero
   probability of the game to be finished, which results in terminal payoff
   on this interval. The method of construction optimal solution for the
   cooperative scenario of such games is proposed. The results are
   illustrated by the example of differential game of investment in the
   public stock of knowledge.}},

Journal = {{RESEARCH IN VETERINARY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{133}},
Pages = {{289-296}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Trichinella spiralis has historically been deemed ``the pig parasite{''}
   owing to its initial classification within a monospecific genus.
   However, in recent years, the genus has expanded to include 10 distinct
   species and at least 3 different genotypes whose taxonomic status
   remains unstipulated. In contrast to T. spiralis, however, most of these
   sylvatic species and genotypes do not infect pigs well. Inasmuch as
   morphological characters cannot be used to define species within this
   genus, earlier classifications were based upon host and geographical
   ranges, biological characters, and the presence or absence of a collagen
   capsule that surrounds the muscle stage larvae. Later, isoenzymes, DNA
   gel fragmentation patterns and DNA probes were used to help in
   identification and classification. Today, amidst the ``-omics{''}
   revolution, new molecular and biochemical-based methodologies have
   improved detection, differentiation and characterization at all levels
   including worm populations. These efforts have discernably expanded
   immunological, epidemiological, and genetic studies resulting in better
   hypotheses on the evolution of the genus, and on global events,
   transmission cycles, host associations, and biogeographical histories
   that contributed to its cosmopolitan distribution. Reviews of this sort
   are best begun with a background on the genus; however, efforts will
   divert to the most recent knowledge available on the taxonomy,
   phylogeny, epidemiology and biochemistry that define this genus in the
   21st century.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The properties of copper in its solid state are strongly affected by the
   crystallization conditions of the liquid material. ETP grade copper
   (Electrolytic Tough Pitch Copper) contains oxygen, which causes Cu2O
   oxide to crystallize in the interdendritic spaces during solidification
   process which due to the shape of continuous casting mould and the feed
   of liquid copper during the crystallization process in strand casting
   might cause a high risk of macrosegregation of oxygen in the copper
   structure. In the current paper the implied interactions of the
   dendritic structure of the copper strand in terms of homogeneity at the
   cross-section of its electrical, mechanical and plastic properties
   determined based on the samples taken parallelly and perpendicularly to
   the surface of the dendritic boundaries were analysed. The obtained
   results were confronted with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images
   of the fractures formed during uniaxial tensile test. It has been
   observed that when the crystallites were arranged perpendicularly to the
   tensile direction the yield strength (YS) was lower and the fractures
   were brittle. On the other hand, when the crystallites were arranged
   parallelly to the tensile direction the fractures were plastic and
   elongated necking was observed along with the higher YS and total
   elongation values. The differences in values vary in terms of the
   applied direction of the tensile force. A characteristic positioning of
   the Cu2O oxide particles inside the fracture depending on the
   crystallite alignment and the direction of the applied tensile force has
   been observed.}},

Title = {{Fluoxetine increases hippocampal neural survival by improving axonal
   transport in stress-induced model of depression male rats}},
Journal = {{PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{227}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Axonal transport deficit is a key mechanism involved in
   neurodegenerative conditions. Fluoxetine, a commonly used antidepressant
   for treatment of depression, is known to regulate several important
   structural and neurochemical aspects of hippocampal functions. However,
   the mechanisms underlying these effects are still poorly understood.
   This study aimed to investigate the effects of chronic fluoxetine
   treatment on axonal transport in the hippocampus of rat stress-induced
   model of depression.
   Methods: We have analyzed the effects of chronic fluoxetine treatment
   (20 mg/kg/day, 24 days) on immobility behavior (forced swimming test),
   hippocampal iNOS (inflammatory factor) expression (RT-PCR) as well as
   hippocampal BDNF, kinesin and dynein expression (RT-PCR) and hippocampal
   neuronal survival (Nissl staining).
   Results: This study provided evidence that fluoxetine could effectively
   suppress iNOS expression following unpredictable chronic mild stress (P
   < 0.01), increase hippocampal BDNF (P < 0.01), kinesin ( P < 0.05) and
   dynein (P< 0.01) gene expression, and control neuronal death in CA1 (P<
   0.01) and CA3 regions (P< 0.01) of the hippocampus and thereby improve
   immobility behavior (P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Based on the findings of this study, we concluded the
   neuroprotective effect of fluoxetine may be due to its ability to
   improve axonal transmission, followed by increased energy supply and
   neurotrophin concentration and function.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is a master regulator of mitosis
   and overexpressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We conducted a phase
   Ib study of the PLK1 inhibitor, onvansertib, in combination with either
   low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) or decitabine in patients with relapsed or
   refractory (R/R) AML.
   Patients and Methods: Onvansertib was administered orally, in escalating
   doses, on days 1-5 in combination with either LDAC (20 mg/m(2); days
   1-10) or decitabine (20 mg/m(2); days 1-5) in a 28-day cycle. The
   primary endpoint was to evaluate first-cycle dose-limiting toxicities
   and the MTD. Secondary and exploratory end-points included safety,
   pharmacokinetics, antileukemic activity, and response biomarkers.
   Results: Forty patients were treated with onvansertib (12-90 mg/m(2)) in
   combination with LDAC (n = 17) or decitabine (n = 23). Onvansertib was
   well tolerated with most grades 3 and 4 adverse events related to
   myelosuppression. In the decitabine arm, the MTD was established at 60
   mg/m(2), and 5 (24\%) of the 21 evaluable patients achieved complete
   remission with or without hematologic count recovery. Decrease in mutant
   circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) during the first cycle of therapy was
   associated with clinical response. Engagement of the PLK1 target, TCTP,
   was measured in circulating blasts and was associated with greater
   decrease in bone marrow blasts.
   Conclusions: The onvansertib and decitabine combination was well
   tolerated and had antileukemic activity particularly in patients with
   target engagement and decreased mutant ctDNA following treatment. This
   combination will be further investigated in the ongoing phase II trial.}},

Abstract = {{Involvement in vegetable preparation is thought to be an effective
   strategy to increase children's vegetable intake, but the evidence from
   experimental studies is scarce. A between-subject experiment was
   executed in a restaurant setting to investigate the effect of
   participation in vegetable preparation on 4-6-year-old children's
   vegetable intake. After a baseline evening meal, intervention children
   (N = 50) participated in a vegetable preparation session together with
   an enthusiastic chef. Control children (N = 51) participated in small
   groups in a book-reading activity. Subsequently, they ate an evening
   meal. Follow-up sessions at one month and three months were included to
   assess possible longer-term effects. Vegetable intake was the main
   outcome. Secondary outcomes were vegetable choice and involvement in
   food-related activities at home. For all four sessions, children's
   vegetable intake ranged between 50 and 60 g in both conditions (p >
   0.05). Participation in carrot preparation did not increase children's
   vegetable intake. Involvement in food-related activities at home
   remained stable in the intervention group, whereas it decreased slightly
   in the control group (p = 0.01). A cluster analysis identified four
   distinct vegetable eating patterns over time, suggesting that there are

Abstract = {{Background: Studies using stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) dose
   escalation in in low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients
   have indicated favorable outcomes.
   Objective: To evaluate tolerance and tumor control outcomes in low- and
   intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients treated with high-dose SBRT
   following our phase 1 trial.
   Design, setting, and participants: A total of 551 patients with low- or
   intermediate-risk prostate cancer were treated with SBRT.
   Intervention: Treatment with 37.5-40 Gy SBRT in five fractions directed
   to the prostate and seminal vesicles.
   Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Outcome measurements
   included acute toxicities (<3 mo after radiotherapy {[}RT]) and late
   toxicities (>3 mo after RT) and tumor control evaluation
   (prostate-specific antigen {[}PSA] levels at 3-6-mo intervals and
   post-treatment prostate biopsy at 2 yr).
   Results and limitations: Acute grade 2 gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities
   occurred in 1.8\% of patients, and late grade 2 and 3 GI toxicities were
   observed in 3.4\% and 0.4\% of patients, respectively. Acute grade 2
   genitourinary (GU) toxicities occurred in 10\% of patients, and grade 3
   acute GU toxicities were observed in 0.7\% of patients. Late grade 2 and
   3 GU toxicities were observed in 21.1\% and 2.5\% of patients,
   respectively. The use of a hydrogel rectal spacer was significantly
   associated with reduced late GI toxicity and lower odds of developing
   late GU toxicity. The median follow-up was 17 mo, and 53\% of those with
   at least 2 yr of follow-up (103/193) had a biopsy performed. The 5-yr
   cumulative incidence of PSA failure was 2.1\%, and the incidence of a
   positive 2-yr treatment biopsy was 12\%. Limitations to this report
   include its retrospective nature and short follow-up time.
   Conclusions: Favorable short-term outcomes were achieved with high-dose
   SBRT for low- and intermediate-risk disease. Severe late toxicities were
   observed and favorable tumor control was found.
   Patient summary: We utilized stereotactic body radiotherapy, a form of
   external beam radiotherapy that delivers highly targeted high-dose
   treatment to the prostate, to treat over 500 localized prostate cancer
   patients in five sessions over 1.5 wk. Treatments were well tolerated
   without significant urinary or rectal side effects. Nearly 90\% of those
   who underwent biopsies after treatment did not demonstrate residual
   active disease. (C) 2019 European Association of Urology. Published by

Title = {{Comparative fishery yields of African Large Marine Ecosystems}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{SI}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Fisheries around Africa have historically suffered from the erroneous
   perception that there is little to no data on or knowledge about these
   activities, beyond the sometimes questionable or sparse official
   reported capture statistics. However, concerted efforts by scientists in
   and associated with Africa have changed this over the last decades. This
   includes the decade long efforts of the global Sea Around Us initiative
   to reconstruct comprehensive estimates of total fisheries catches in the
   waters of each African country, and create indicators using these data.
   Here, we build on these and other efforts, and review the main catch
   features, and landed values over the last 65 years generated by the
   fisheries in the seven Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) that surround the
   African continent, i.e., Canary Current, Guinea Current, Benguela
   Current, Agulhas Current, Somali Coastal Current, Red Sea, and
   Mediterranean Sea LMEs. Note that the small African coastal area (north
   coast of Somalia and Djibouti) covered by the Arabian Sea LME is
   excluded here due to its negligible contribution to the Arabian Sea LME.
   We illustrate which countries or geographic regions extract catches in
   each LME, with focus on African versus non-African fishing countries;
   examine the potential for fishing down the food web in each LME; as well
   as the time trends in the status of stocks. Finally, we present
   comprehensive economic data describing the fisheries around Africa.
   Jointly, these data and indicators suggest that the fisheries around
   Africa have reached their peak, and in many cases, moved beyond peak
   catches to a declining trend. Indeed, these fisheries mostly rely on
   overfished resources in all LMEs. Thus, better management, monitoring,
   compliance and policy efforts are needed around Africa, with a strong
   emphasis on regional cooperation, to help rebuild their stocks. Clearly,
   this is a challenging prospect, but seems to be the only rational way to
   maintain what is, for Africa, a crucial economic resource as well as
   food security base.}},

Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Electroencephalogram (EEG) is an effective indicator for the detection
   of driver fatigue. Due to the significant differences in EEG signals
   across subjects, and difficulty in collecting sufficient EEG samples for
   analysis during driving, detecting fatigue across subjects through using
   EEG signals remains a challenge. EasyTL is a kind of transfer-learning
   model, which has demonstrated better performance in the field of image
   recognition, but not yet been applied in cross-subject EEG-based
   applications. In this paper, we propose an improved EasyTL-based
   classifier, the InstanceEasyTL, to perform EEG-based analysis for
   cross-subject fatigue mental-state detection. Experimental results show
   that InstanceEasyTL not only requires less EEG data, but also obtains
   better performance in accuracy and robustness than EasyTL, as well as
   existing machine-learning models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM),
   Transfer Component Analysis (TCA), Geodesic Flow Kernel (GFK), and
   Domain-adversarial Neural Networks (DANN), etc.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Central nervous system aspergillosis (CNS-A) is a rare and fatal fungal
   infection. Voriconazole is the recommended treatment for CNS-A. The
   therapeutic effect of voriconazole is good, but its use is limited due
   to adverse reactions. This case report describes a 37-year-old male
   patient that had previously been diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic
   leukaemia. He had received immunosuppressive agents for 1 year following
   a haematopoietic bone marrow transplant. He presented with a 1-month
   history of left limb weakness as well as recurrent fever. Brain magnetic
   resonance imaging showed that he had multiple cerebral infarctions.
   Subsequently, he was diagnosed with CNS-A by metagenomic next-generation
   sequencing. Voriconazole was added to his treatment regimen, but it
   resulted in severe haemorrhagic cystitis and possibly bladder rupture.
   The dose of voriconazole was adjusted and reparative bladder surgery was
   undertaken immediately. Eventually, the patient was successfully treated
   with voriconazole and there was no recurrence of symptoms after 1 year
   of follow-up. Haemorrhagic cystitis is a rare adverse drug reaction
   associated with voriconazole use. Based on the experience with this
   current case, physicians should be aware of urinary tract complications
   with voriconazole including haemorrhagic cystitis.}},

Abstract = {{Supercapacitors (SCs) have been demonstrated to be one of the most
   promising devices for electrical energy storage and conversion

   And the advertising of service provider will affect the revenue. The
   purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of advertising on
   the optimal price, service rate and the optimal revenue of such service
   provider at different development stages.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This paper investigates the service strategies of service provider based
   on advertising effects. The authors first divide service provider into
   insufficient customers or sufficient customers according to the
   development stage, then analyze the impact of advertising at different
   stages. The authors focus on the formulation of the optimal price,
   service rate and the optimal revenue of service provider at different
   stages.
   Findings
   This paper finds that in the insufficient customers stage, the service
   provider's strategy of ``small profits but quick turnover{''} is
   conducive to quickly accumulating customers. With the development of
   service provider, the advertising indirectly increases the revenue of
   service provider by maintaining popularity. The result also shows that
   with the development of service provider, the initiative of such service
   market has gradually been mastered by service provider, from ``buyer
   market{''} to ``seller market.{''}
   Originality/value
   The finding provides an alternative explanation for the impact of
   advertising on service provider's optimal strategies; it also solves the
   settings of service price and rate of customer-intensive service
   provider at different development stages. This study is essential to
   create the optimal revenue and solve supply-demand conflicts (such as
   doctor-patient conflict) between service provider and customers.}},

Title = {{Mining significant fuzzy association rules with differential evolution
   algorithm}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2020}},

Number = {{B}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This article presents a new differential evolution (DE) algorithm for
   mining optimized statistically significant fuzzy association rules that
   are abundant in number and high in rule interestingness measure (RIM)
   values, with strict control over the risk of spurious rules. The risk
   control over spurious rules, as the most distinctive feature of the
   proposed DE compared with existing evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for
   association rule mining (ARM), is realized via two new statistically
   sound significance tests on the rules. The two tests, in the
   experimentwise and generationwise adjustment approach, can respectively
   limit the familywise error rate (the probability that any spurious rules
   occur in the ARM result) and percentage of spurious rules upon the user
   specified level. Experiments on variously sized data show that the
   proposed DE can keep the risk of spurious rules well below the user
   specified level, which is beyond the ability of existing EA-based ARM.
   The new method also carries forward the advantages of EA-based ARM and
   distinctive merits of DE in optimizing the rules: it can obtain several
   times as many rules and as high RIM values as conventional
   non-evolutionary ARM, and even more informative rules and better RIM
   values than genetic-algorithm-based ARM. Case studies on hotel room
   price determinants and wildfire risk factors demonstrate the practical
   usefulness of the proposed DE. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the potential of folate (FA)-mediated and stearic
   acid (SA) modified Bletilla striata polysaccharide (FA-BSP-SA) copolymer
   as the vehicle for targeted delivery of anticancer drugs to tumor
   tissues and enhanced antitumor efficacy. The critical aggregation
   concentration, morphology, particle size, and zeta potential of micelles
   were increased with the reduction of pH values. The complex between
   doxorubicin (Dox) hydrochloride and sodium cholate via electrostatic
   interaction was fabricated and then directly encapsulated into FA-BSP-SA
   micelles. Dox in micelles existed in the status of amorphism. The
   Dox/FA-BSP-SA micelles demonstrated pH-responsive release behavior under
   the combination of diffusion and erosion mechanism. They could clearly
   strengthen the cellular uptake of Dox and inhibit the proliferation and
   the migration of tumor cells compared with the Dox/BSP-SA micelles and
   the free Dox. The Dox/FA-BSP-SA micelles were further delivered to
   lysosomes, mainly due to clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The FA-BSP-SA
   micelles distinctly improved the absolute bioavailability of Dox
   compared with the free Dox and the Dox/BSP-SA micelles (p < 0.01) and
   prolong the mean residence time. The Dox/FA-BSP-SA micelles
   significantly increased the drug enrichment in the tumor sites and
   enhanced the antitumor effects in vivo. Taken together, the FA-BSP-SA
   micelle could be exploited as a potential platform for targeting
   anticancer drug delivery. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Shadows are frequently observable in high-resolution images, raising
   challenges in image interpretation, such as classification and object
   detection. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for shadow
   detection and restoration of atmospherically corrected hyperspectral
   images based on nonlinear spectral unmixing. The mixture model is
   applied pixel-wise as a nonlinear combination of endmembers related to
   both pure sunlit and shadowed spectra, where the former are manually
   selected from scenes and the latter are derived from sunlit spectra
   following physical assumptions. Shadowed pixels are restored by
   simulating their exposure to sunlight through a combination of sunlit
   endmembers spectra, weighted by abundance values. The proposed framework
   is demonstrated on real airborne hyperspectral images. A comprehensive
   assessment of the restored images is carried out both visually and
   quantitatively. With respect to binary shadow masks, our framework can
   produce soft shadow detection results, keeping the natural transition of
   illumination conditions on shadow boundaries. Our results show that the
   framework can effectively detect shadows and restore information in
   shadowed regions.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Gastrointestinal parasites are some of the most common
   pathogens which are seriously harmful to the camel's health. The
   infection status of gastrointestinal parasites in camels (Camelus
   bactrianus) in the Tianshan Mountains pastoral area in China is still
   unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the species and
   infection intensity of gastrointestinal tract parasites in local camels.
   Material and Methods: A total of 362 fresh faecal samples were collected
   and examined for parasite eggs using the saturated saline floating and
   natural sedimentation method. The parasite eggs were subjected to
   morphological and molecular examination and identification, and the
   infection rate and mean intensity of the parasites were analysed.
   Results: A total of 15 gastrointestinal tract parasite species' eggs
   were identified, with a detection rate of 100\%. Ostertagia spp. (100\%)
   and Trichostrongylus spp. (98.1\%) were dominant. Camels were often
   coinfected by 5-14 species. The average number of eggs per gram of
   faeces was higher for Ostertagia spp. (298), Haemonchus contortus (176)
   and Nematodirus spp. (138). The number of species of parasites infecting
   young camels was significantly lower than that of adult camels, but the
   infection intensity in young camels was significantly higher.
   Conclusion: Gastrointestinal parasites were highly prevalent in camels
   from the Tianshan Mountains pastoral area in China. This finding
   provides important epidemiological data for the prevention and control
   of associated infections in camels.}},

   Imatinib and GNF-5 are breakpoint cluster region-Abelson murine leukemia
   tyrosine kinase inhibitors which have been approved for the treatment of
   chronic myeloid leukemia and various solid tumors. However, the effect
   and underlying mechanisms of imatinib and GNF-5 in HCC remain poorly
   defined. In this study, we investigated the anticancer activity and
   underlying mechanisms of imatinib and GNF-5 in HepG2 human
   hepatocarcinoma cells. Cell proliferation and anchorage-independent
   colony formation assays were done to evaluate the effects of imatinib
   and GNF-5 on the growth of HepG2 cells. The cell cycle was assessed by
   flow cytometry and verified by immunoblot analysis. Gene overexpression
   and knockdown assays were conducted to evaluate the function of S-phase
   kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2). Imatinib and GNF-5 significantly
   inhibited the growth of HepG2 cells. Imatinib and GNF-5 induced G0/G1
   phase cell cycle arrest by downregulating Skp2 and upregulating p27 and
   p21. Overexpression of Skp2 reduced the effect of imatinib and GNF-5 on
   HepG2 cells. Knockdown of Skp2 suppressed the proliferation and induced
   GO/ G1 phase arrest. Furthermore, knockdown of Skp2 enhanced the effect
   of imatinib and GNF-5 on growth of HepG2 cells. In conclusion, imatinib
   and GNF-5 effectively suppress HepG2 cell growth by inhibiting Skp2
   expression. Skp2 promotes the cell proliferation and reverse G0/G1 phase
   cell cycle arrest and it represents a potential therapeutic target for
   HCC treatment.}},

Title = {{Calculation and experimentation on the formation sequence of compounds
   at Al/Ti interface in pure Al antioxidant coatings}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS TODAY COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{25}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{To investigate the precipitation order of intermetallic compounds at the
   Al/Ti interface, the enthalpy, entropy, Gibbs free energy, and heat
   capacity of Ti-Al compounds (including TiAl3, TiAl2, Ti3Al, and TiAl)
   were calculated using first-principles. In addition, the enthalpy of
   formation, entropy of formation and Gibbs free energy of formation of
   Ti-Al compounds were further calculated. By combining thermodynamics and
   diffusion dynamics, the effective free energy of formation model is
   proposed to predict the formation sequence of compounds at the Al/Ti
   interface. The results showed that the formation sequence of Ti-Al
   compounds followed TiAl3 -> TiAl2 -> TiAl -> Ti3Al. Subsequently, the
   pure Al coating was prepared on the surface of pure titanium plate by
   arc spraying equipment and the specimens were heat-treated. The
   experimental results show that there was a transition zone composed of
   four layers of Ti-Al compounds at the interface. From the Al layer to
   the matrix direction, the four-layer compounds were TiAl3 -> TiAl2 ->
   TiAl -> Ti3Al in turn, which was consistent with the calculated results.
   The EBSD analysis of the Al/Ti interface shows that the grain size of
   TiAl3 decreases gradually from the coating to the substrate direction
   when the heat treatment condition is 800 degrees C/5 h, and the grain
   size and thickness of the Ti3Al layer are both larger than that of TiAl2
   and TiAl layer. The Ti-Al phases at the interface presented random grain
   orientation. Finally, the calculation results of the preferred
   adsorption position of oxygen atoms on the TiAl3 (110)-Al surface show
   that the position of Al-Al bridge is the most preferred adsorption
   position of oxygen atoms and oxygen atoms are more inclined to form
   aluminum oxide by bonding with Al atoms.}},

Title = {{Sampling-Based Motion Planning for Free-Floating Space Robot without
   Inverse Kinematics}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Motion planning is one of the most important technologies for
   free-floating space robots (FFSRs) to increase operation safety and
   autonomy in orbit. As a nonholonomic system, a first-order differential
   relationship exists between the joint angle and the base attitude of the
   space robot, which makes it pretty challenging to implement the relevant
   motion planning. Meanwhile, the existing planning framework must solve
   inverse kinematics for goal configuration and has the limitation that
   the goal configuration and the initial configuration may not be in the
   same connected domain. Thus, faced with these questions, this paper
   investigates a novel motion planning algorithm based on
   rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs) for an FFSR from an initial
   configuration to a goal end-effector (EE) pose. In a motion planning
   algorithm designed to deal with differential constraints and restrict
   base attitude disturbance, two control-based local planners are
   proposed, respectively, for random configuration guiding growth and goal
   EE pose-guiding growth of the tree. The former can ensure the effective
   exploration of the configuration space, and the latter can reduce the
   possibility of occurrence of singularity while ensuring the fast
   convergence of the algorithm and no violation of the attitude
   constraints. Compared with the existing works, it does not require the
   inverse kinematics to be solved while the planning task is completed and
   the attitude constraint is preserved. The simulation results verify the
   effectiveness of the algorithm.}},

   present study finds that empty bubbles in tungsten lead to a decrease in
   the lattice thermal conductivity of tungsten. Furthermore, He/D filled

Abstract = {{Urban topsoil is the most frequent interface between human society and
   natural environment. The accumulation of heavy metals in the urban
   topsoil has a direct effect on residents' life and health. The
   geochemical baseline of heavy metals is an objective description of the
   general level of heavy metals in the urban topsoil. Meanwhile, the
   determination of geochemical baseline is necessary for regional
   environmental management, especially in coal cities prone to heavy metal
   pollution. Heavy metal pollution has become an environmental problem in
   Fuxin City, China for a long time. To establish the geochemical baseline
   of heavy metals in the topsoil of Fuxin City and to evaluate the
   ecological risk of the topsoil, we collected 75 topsoil samples (0-20
   cm) and analyzed the concentrations of Cu, Ni, Zn, Pb, Cr, Cd, Hg and As
   through X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, atomic absorption spectrometry
   and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. We
   determined the geochemical baseline of heavy metals in the topsoil of
   Fuxin City by using iteration removal, box-whisker plot, cumulative
   frequency curve and reference metal normalization; evaluated the
   contamination risk and ecological risk of the topsoil by using the
   baseline factor index, Nemerow index and Hakanson potential ecological
   risk index; and identified the source category of heavy metals in the
   topsoil by using a pedigree clustering heatmap. Results showed that the
   geochemical baseline values were 42.86, 89.34, 92.23, 60.55, 145.21,
   0.09, 0.08 and 4.17 mg/kg for Cu, Ni, Zn, Pb, Cr, Cd, Hg and As,
   respectively. The results of Nemerow index and Hakanson potential
   ecological risk index indicated that the urban topsoil in the study area
   was slightly contaminated and suffering low potential ecological risk.
   The main contaminated areas dominated in the middle part and northeast
   part of the study area, especially in the western Haizhou Strip Mine.
   The result of baseline factor index indicated that Hg and Cd were the
   major pollution elements. Using a pedigree clustering heatmap, we
   divided the sources of these heavy metals into three types: type I for
   Ni and Cr, largely represented the enrichment of heavy metals from
   natural sources; type II for Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd and As, mainly represented
   the enrichment of heavy metals from anthropogenic sources; and type III
   for Hg, represented the form of both natural and anthropogenic inputs.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Among the first series transition metal (TM) ions, not only the
   paramagnetic TM ions (such as Cr-III, Mn-II/Mn-III, Fe-II/Fe-III, Co-II,
   Ni-II and Cu-II) but also diamagnetic TM ions (such as Co-III and Zn-II)
   can assemble with Dy-III to form the TM-Dy single molecule magnets
   (TM-Dy SMMs). In this paper, we survey most of the TM-Dy complexes with
   SMM behavior. For the TM-Dy SMMs, two interesting phenomena should be
   emphasized on. One is some Cr-Dy complexes possessing relatively high
   blocking temperature (T-8) and large coercivities, which could be
   ascribed to the strong magnetic couplings between Cr-III and Dy-III ions
   (vertical bar J vertical bar>10 cm(-1)). Another is the Fe-2(II)-Dy
   complex with the energy barrier of 319 cm(-1) (459 K), which is high
   among the TM-Dy SMMs. The reason might be that the axial symmetry of the
   coordination of Dy-III ion is high (D-5h). Additionally, ab initio
   calculations indicate the excited state also possess high axial
   symmetry. Besides the Cr-III-Dy and Fe-2(II)-Dy complexes, other TM-Dy
   SMMs usually exhibits relatively low energy barriers, which may be due
   to the weak magnetic interactions between paramagnetic TM ions and
   Dy(III )ions. To elimate the effect of the weak magnetic couplings on
   the relaxation behavior, the study of the DTM-Dy SMMs (DTM=diamagnetic
   the first series transition metal ions such as Co-III and Zn-II) has
   been received wide attention and their number is dramatically
   increasing. For the Zn-Dy SMMs, the number of the Zn2Dy trinuclear
   complexes is larger than that of other Zn-Dy complexes, indicating that
   the Zn2Dy received more attention. The reason might be that the
   coordination geometry of the Dy-III in the Zn2Dy complexes can be more
   easily modulated. Finally, we provided sonic reseach thoughts for
   further improving the SMM performance of the TM-Dy eoniplexes; the most
   important thoughts are that the axial symmetry of the coordination
   geometries of Dy(III )ions and the distribution of charge density of
   Dy-III ions in TM-Dy complexes should be controlled. For Dy-III in the
   TM-Dy complexes, the electrostatic repulsion between the Dy(III
   )ground-m(j) charge density and the ligand charge density should be
   minimized.}},

Title = {{Chromatin-regulating genes are associated with postoperative prognosis
   and isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation in astrocytoma}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE}},

Abstract = {{Background: Abnormality in chromatin regulation is a major determinant
   in the progression of multiple neoplasms. Astrocytoma is a malignant
   histologic morphology of glioma that is commonly accompanied by
   chromatin dysregulation. However, the systemic interpretation of the
   expression characteristics of chromatin-regulating genes in astrocytoma
   is unclear.
   Methods: In this study, we investigated the expression profile of
   chromatin regulation genes in 194 astrocytoma patients sourced from The
   Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The relevance of gene expression
   and postoperative survival outcomes was assessed.
   Results: Based on the expression patterns of chromatin regulation genes,
   two primary clusters and three sub lusters with significantly different
   survival outcomes were identified. The patients in duster\_l (or
   subcluster\_1) had a poorer prognosis than the other groups, and this
   particular cohort were older, with a more advanced grade of tumor and
   isocitrate dehydrogenase-wildtype distribution. Detection of the
   differentially expressed genes revealed that the group with poor
   prognosis was characterized by downregulation of H2AFY2, WAC, HDAC5,
   ZMYND11, TET1, SATB1, and MYST4, and overexpression of EYA4. Moreover,
   all eight genes were significantly correlated with overall survival (OS)
   in astrocytoma. Age-associated genes were investigated and the
   expression levels of EYA4, TET1, SATB1, WAC, ZMYND11, and H2AFY2 were
   found to be closely correlated with advanced age. Regression analysis
   suggested that the expression levels of H2AFY2, HILS1, EYA1, EYA4, and
   KDM5B were independently associated with IDH mutation status. The
   differential expressions of 34 common genes were significantly
   associated with age, grade, and IDH mutant.
   Conclusions: The study revealed that the expression pattern of chromatin
   regulation genes was significantly associated with postoperative
   prognosis in astrocytoma. Moreover, the differential expression of
   particular genes was strongly associated with clinical characteristics
   such as age, grade, and IDH subtype. These results suggest that the
   genes involved in chromatin regulation play important roles in the
   biological process of astrocytoma progression, and these molecules could
   potentially serve as therapeutic targets in astrocytoma.}},

   Features}},
Journal = {{ACTA PHOTONICA SINICA}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Aiming at the problem of LIDAR and camera data fusion, a calibration
   method of 2D LIDAR and color camera based on indoor structural features
   was proposed. According to the position relationship between the point
   and lines, pillar features of the indoor scene are used to derive the
   projection matrix equation between the 2D LIDAR and the camera
   coordinate systems. The Canny operator and Hough transform are employed
   to extract the line features of the corner image. Afterwards, the RANSAC
   method is used to fit the corner features from the point cloud. The
   projection matrix is solved by the singular value decomposition method.
   Finally, the calibration results are further optimized after removing
   the data with large reprojection errors. The experimental results show
   that the average reprojection error of the pillar feature point is
   reduced from 0.3755 pixels to 0.0459 pixels by adopting optimized
   projection matrix. Compared with the two-step calibration method, the
   algorithm proposed in this paper has a better reprojection effect. At
   the same time, this method does not require a specific calibration
   object, and can achieve high projection accuracy in less time.}},

Title = {{Influence of new energy vehicle subsidy policy on emission reduction of
   atmospheric pollutants: A case study of Beijing, China}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{275}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{New energy vehicles (NEVs) have great potential to reduce emissions
   containing atmospheric pollutants. The Chinese Government has
   implemented a series of subsidy policies to promote NEVs and replace
   traditional fuel vehicles (TFVs). However, the contribution of NEVs in
   reducing atmospheric pollutants varies due to differences in mileages
   and emission factors. Previous literature has rarely studied the
   influence of NEV subsidy policies on the reduction of atmospheric
   pollutants, especially with respect to different kinds of vehicles. This
   paper divides motor vehicles into four categories: buses, taxis,
   passenger cars, and special vehicles. Taking into account the purchase
   subsidies and construction subsidies on the charging infrastructure of
   NEVs, this paper proposes an evaluation index, namely, the comprehensive
   subsidy efficiency, that measures the effectiveness of the two subsidies
   in reducing emissions of atmospheric pollutants among different NEVs. In
   response to Beijing's plan to prioritize the promotion of battery
   electric vehicles (BEVs), this paper uses relevant data of BEVs instead
   of NEVs for the analysis. Taking Beijing as a case study, promotion
   proportion of NEVs were set according to the comprehensive subsidy
   efficiency of various NEVs; furthermore, scenario simulation of NEV
   subsidy policies in 2017 and 2020 was conducted. The results revealed
   new energy taxis and special vehicles have great a potential to
   alleviate the greenhouse effect and haze weather, respectively. By
   prioritizing the promotion of NEVs with higher comprehensive subsidy
   efficiency, one can achieve greater reduction in the emissions of
   atmospheric pollutants with equal financial funds. Furthermore, this
   paper suggests subsidy policies of NEVs from the perspective of reducing
   emissions of atmospheric pollutants. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The genome of the thermophilic bacteriophage GVE2 encodes a putative
   tailspike protein (GVE2 TSP). Here we report the crystal structure of
   the truncated GVE2 TSP at 2.0-A resolution lacking 204 amino acid
   residues at its N-terminus (Delta nGVE2 TSP), possessing a ``vase{''}
   outline similar to other TSP's structures. However, Delta nGVE2 TSP
   displays structural characteristics distinct from other TSPs. Despite
   lacking 204 amino acid residues, the head domain forms an asymmetric
   trimer compared to symmetric in other TSPs, suggesting that its long
   N-terminus may be unique to the long-tailed bacteriophages. Furthermore,
   the alpha-helix of the neck is 5-7 amino acids longer than that of other
   TSPs. The most striking feature is that its binding domain consists of a
   beta-helix with 10 turns, whereas other TSPs have 13 turns, even
   including the phage Sf6 TSP, which is the closest homologue of GVE2 TSP.
   The C-terminal structure is also quite different with those of other
   TSPs. Furthermore, we observed that Delta nGVE2 TSP can slow down growth
   of its host, demonstrating that this TSP is essential for the phage GVE2
   to infect its host. Overall, the structural characteristics suggest that
   GVE2 TSP may bemore primitive than other phage TSPs. (C) 2020 Published

Title = {{Non-standard Birkhoffian dynamics and its Noether's theorems}},
Journal = {{COMMUNICATIONS IN NONLINEAR SCIENCE AND NUMERICAL SIMULATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{91}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The most common problems in nature are about non-conservative
   non-linearity. Non-conservative non-linear problems can be studied with
   variational problems of nonstandard Lagrangians. Birkhoffian mechanics,
   as an extension of Hamiltonian mechanics naturally, is a sign that
   analytical mechanics has entered a new stage of development. Therefore,
   the study of dynamics based on non-standard Birkhoffians provides a new
   idea for solving non-conservative nonlinear dynamics problems. In this
   paper the dynamics models based on non-standard Birkhoffians, including
   exponential Birkhoffian, power law Birkhoffian, and logarithm
   Birkhoffian, are proposed, which are called non-standard Birkhoffian
   systems. Firstly, the Pfaff-Birkhoff principles with non-standard
   Birkhoffians are established, the differential equations of motion of
   non-standard Birkhoffian dynamics are also derived. Secondly, in
   accordance with the invariance of Pfaff action under the infinitesimal
   transformations, giving the definitions and criteria of Noether
   symmetric and quasisymmetric transformations of non-standard Birkhoffian
   dynamics. And next, Noether's theorems for non-standard Birkhoffian
   dynamics are proved, and the connections between Noether symmetries and
   conserved quantities of non-standard Birkhoffian dynamics are
   established; Finally, three examples are given to illustrate the
   applications of the results. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cervical cancer is one of the most common types of gynecological tumor,
   and thus identifying complementary or substitute treatment methods to
   treat cervical cancer is important. The present study aimed to evaluate
   the effect of arsenic trioxide (ATO), a traditional Chinese medicine, on
   cervical cancer cells and its underlying mechanism. MTT, colony
   formation and Transwell assays were performed to investigate the effects
   of different concentrations of ATO on cell proliferation and invasion,
   respectively. Western blotting and reverse transcription-quantitative
   PCR were applied to measure hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha expression
   (HIF-1 alpha) expression following ATO treatment. Finally, the effects
   of HIF-1 alpha knockdown on cervical cancer cell proliferation,
   apoptosis and invasion were evaluated. The results demonstrated that ATO
   could inhibit cell proliferation and invasion. Moreover, ATO could
   induce reactive oxygen species production in a time- and dose-dependent
   manner. ATO could also promote the apoptosis of cervical cancer cells
   via HIF-1 alpha. Therefore, the present study may provide a theoretical
   basis for identifying effective molecular targets for the prevention and

Title = {{Texture Synthesis Repair of RealSense D435i Depth Images with
   Object-Oriented RGB Image Segmentation}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A depth camera is a kind of sensor that can directly collect distance
   information between an object and the camera. The RealSense D435i is a
   low-cost depth camera that is currently in widespread use. When
   collecting data, an RGB image and a depth image are acquired
   simultaneously. The quality of the RGB image is good, whereas the depth
   image typically has many holes. In a lot of applications using depth
   images, these holes can lead to serious problems. In this study, a
   repair method of depth images was proposed. The depth image is repaired
   using the texture synthesis algorithm with the RGB image, which is
   segmented through a multi-scale object-oriented method. The object
   difference parameter is added to the process of selecting the best
   sample block. In contrast with previous methods, the experimental
   results show that the proposed method avoids the error filling of holes,
   the edge of the filled holes is consistent with the edge of RGB images,
   and the repair accuracy is better. The root mean square error, peak
   signal-to-noise ratio, and structural similarity index measure from the
   repaired depth images and ground-truth image were better than those
   obtained by two other methods. We believe that the repair of the depth
   image can improve the effects of depth image applications.}},

Abstract = {{Background: DICER1 syndrome is an inherited tumor predisposition
   syndrome. A germline mutation in DICER1 increases the risk for a
   spectrum of rare tumors. We describe a case of somatic DICER1 mutation
   in a pubertal girl, who is affected by different tumors of the DICER1
   syndrome, including embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) of the cervix and
   thyroid adenoma.
   Case: A 16-year-old girl with history of papillary thyroid adenoma
   presented with abnormal vaginal bleeding and an exophytic cervical mass
   on examination. Histopathologic examination confirmed cervical ERMS. By
   using Sanger sequencing of the tumor, we identified 1 DICER1 mutation
   (c.3937delG).
   Summary and Conclusion: This report suggests that a patient with these 2
   unrelated tumors (ERMS and papillary thyroid adenoma) should be promptly
   tested for DICER1 gene mutations.}},

Title = {{Agrin Involvement in Synaptogenesis Induced by Exercise in a Rat Model

Abstract = {{Background
   Agrin is a proteoglycan that aggregates nicotinic acetylcholine
   receptors (AChRs) on neuromuscular junctions and takes part in
   synaptogenesis in the development of the central nervous system.
   However, its effects on neural repair and synaptogenesis after stroke
   are still unclear.
   Objective
   This study aimed to investigate the effects of agrin on neural repair
   and synaptogenesis after stroke and the effects of exercise on this
   process in vivo and in vitro.
   Methods
   Exercise with gradually increased intensity was initiated at 1 day after
   middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for a maximum of 14 days.
   Neurological deficit scores and foot fault tests were used to assess the
   behavioral recovery. Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and electron
   microscopic images were used to detect the expression of agrin,
   synaptogenesis-related proteins, and synaptic density in vivo. In vitro,
   the ischemic neuron model was established via oxygen-glucose deprivation
   (OGD). The lentivirus overexpressed agrin and CREB inhibitor were used
   to investigate the mechanism by which agrin promoted synaptogenesis.
   Results
   Exercise promoted behavioral recovery and this beneficial role was
   linked to the upregulated expression of agrin and increased synaptic
   density. Overexpressed agrin promoted synaptogenesis in OGD neuron, CREB
   inhibitor downregulated the expression of agrin and hampered
   synaptogenesis in cultured neurons.
   Conclusions
   These results indicated that exercise poststroke improved the recovery
   of behavioral function after stroke. Synaptogenesis was an important and
   beneficial factor, and agrin played a critical role in this process and
   could be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of stroke and
   other nervous system diseases.}},

Abstract = {{To improve the detection accuracy and reduce the complexity of optical
   remote sensing of target images with a complex background, a global
   context detection model based on optical remote sensing of targets is
   proposed. First, a feature encoder-feature decoder network is used for
   feature extraction. Then, to improve the positioning ability of
   multi-scale targets, a method that combines global-contextual features
   and target center local features is used to generate high-resolution
   heat maps. The global features are used to achieve the
   pre-classification of targets. Finally, a positioning loss function at
   different scales is proposed to enhance the regression ability of the
   model. Experimental results show that the mean average precision of the
   proposed model reaches 97.6\% AP(50) and 83.4\% AP(75) on the NWPU
   VHR-10 public remote sensing data set, and the speed reaches 16 PFS.
   This design can achieve an effective balance between accuracy and speed.
   It facilitates subsequent porting and application of the algorithm on
   the mobile device side, which meets design requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Lincomycin, as one of the most commonly used antibiotics, may cause
   intestinal injury, enteritis and other side effects, but it remains
   unknown whether these effects are associated with microbial changes and
   the effects of different doses of lincomycin on infants. Here, 21-day
   old mice were exposed to 1 and 5 g/L lincomycin to explore the effects
   of lincomycin on the gut microbiota, metabolites and inflammation.
   Compared to the control mice, 1 g/L lincomycin exposure decreased the
   body weight gain of mice (p < 0.05). Both 1 and 5 g/L lincomycin
   exposure reduced the diversity and microbial composition of mice (p <
   0.05). Furthermore, 1 and 5 g/L lincomycin reduced the relative
   concentrations of acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate, isobutyric
   acid and isovaleric acid in the colon chyme of mice (p < 0.05). In
   addition, 5 g/L lincomycin exposure reduced the villus height, crypt
   depth, and relative expression of TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, IL-18, TNF-alpha,
   and p65 in the jejunum of mice (p < 0.05), while 1 g/L lincomycin
   exposure reduced the relative expression of TLR2, TLR3, TNF-alpha, and
   p65 (p < 0.05). Collectively, these results highlight the depletion
   effect of short-term lincomycin exposure on microbiota and the further

Abstract = {{Background: Animal studies have shown that soy protein and isoflavones
   can increase antioxidant capacity and improve insulin resistance, and
   thus ameliorate nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, only
   limited epidemiological studies have examined the association of soy
   food intake with NAFLD.
   Objectives: We investigated the association between soy food intake and
   NAFLD in a Chinese cohort.
   Methods: A total of 24,622 participants aged 20-90 y were included in
   the study. Diet information was collected using a validated 100-item
   FFQ. NAFLD was defined as having fatty liver diagnosed by
   ultrasonography and excluding men and women who consumed >210 g
   alcohol/wk and >140 g/wk, respectively. Logistic regression analysis was
   used to assess the association of soy food intake with NAFLD.
   Results: After adjustment for potential confounders, and taking those
   with <1 time/wk soy food intake as the reference group, the ORs for
   NAFLD across soy food intake frequency were 0.94 (95\% CI: 0.83, 1.07)
   for 1 time/wk, 0.88 (95\% CI: 0.78, 0.99) for 2-3 times/wk, and 0.75
   (95\% CI: 0.65, 0.87) for =4 times/wk (P-trend <0.0001). The results
   were similar when participants were categorized by the energy-adjusted
   soy food intake (grams per 1000 kilocalories) quartiles (OR = 0.80; 95\%
   CI: 0.71, 0.91; comparing extreme quartiles).
   Conclusions: Higher soy food intake was associated with a lower
   prevalence of NAFLD in Chinese adults. Further prospective studies and
   randomized clinical trials are necessary to confirm if soy food intake
   is inversely related to the risk of NAFLD.}},

Title = {{Evaluating the synergy strength among environmental pressures at the
   sectoral level of China from the producer, consumer and supplier
   perspectives}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{275}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{There is a growing interest among policymakers on synergies and
   trade-offs among environmental pressures (EPs). However, there is a gap
   in the literature to quantitatively measure the synergy strength among
   EPs; and more specifically, the synergy strength involving multiple
   pollutant emissions from various perspectives (e.g., the producer,
   consumer, and supplier perspectives). In this avenue, this study
   proposes and demonstrates the utility of the `synergy strength' metric -
   a measure of the level of co-benefits of changes in EPs. Using the
   Environmentally Extended Input-Output database of China, we examine the
   `synergy strength' of changes among China's 27 EPs during the 2002-2012
   period from the producer, consumer, and supplier perspectives. Our
   results reveal that: (1) In recent years, i.e., during the 2007-2012
   period, synergy strength has increased. (2) During the 2007-2012 period,
   the synergy strength was higher from the consumer and supplier
   perspectives in comparison to the producer perspective. (3) Synergy
   strength induced by consumption decreased during the 2007-2012 period.
   (4) The synergy strength is very low in the Electricity and heat
   production and supply; Construction; and Coal mining and processing
   sectors. Our study demonstrates how the analysis of `synergy strength'
   among EPs supplements the evaluation of the sectorial mitigation of
   emissions. More specifically, our study demonstrates how environmental
   and energy policy can be improved by considering the effective
   utilization of the co-benefits of the mitigation of particular emissions
   and by formulating relevant integrated policies. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Effect of quercetin (flavonoid) supplementation on growth performance,
   meat stability, and immunological response in broiler chickens}},
Journal = {{LIVESTOCK SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{242}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This study was conducted to determine the effect of quercetin
   supplementation on growth performance, meat stability, excreta gas
   emission, and immunological response in broiler chickens. A total of 640
   broiler chickens were randomly assigned to 1 of the 4 treatments (10
   replicates per treatment with 18 chickens per pen). Dietary treatments:
   basal diet contained 0, 250, 500, and 1,000 mg quercetin/kg. The chronic
   heat stress condition was maintained (32 degrees C) for 24 h from the
   fourth day of the study. Growth performance was assessed on d 0, 7, 21,
   and 35, whereas all other response criteria were determined on d 35.
   Overall, a quadratic effect of quercetin supplementation on body weight
   gain (BWG) was observed when quercetin supplementation was increased (P
   < 0.05). And these responses were maximized in the broiler chickens fed
   diet with 250 mg quercetin/kg. There was a linear and quadratic effect
   of quercetin supplementation on Lactobacillus counts (P < 0.05). As the
   dietary supplementation of quercetin increased, the content of total
   superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC)
   linearly increased (P < 0.05), while the malondialdehyde (MDA)
   concentration linearly reduced in breast muscle (P < 0.05). There was a
   linear decrease in abdominal fat content when quercetin supplementation
   was increased (P < 0.05). The concentration of tumor necrosis
   factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) linearly increased by adding an increasing
   dosage of quercetin in the diet (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the addition
   of quercetin in the diet could improve BWG which reflected a beneficial
   effect of quercetin for growth performance. Increasing dose range from 0
   to 1,000 mg quercetin/kg could linearly increase the content of T-AOC
   and T-SOD, and reduce the concentration of MDA, which reflected that the
   increased quercetin supplementation can enhance meat stability.
   Furthermore, supplementation of quercetin could increase the level of
   TNF-alpha, which indicated the ability of quercetin to enhance the
   immune capacity of broiler chickens.}},

Abstract = {{In the autumn of 2011, both the time budget and diurnal rhythm of
   behavior of black-necked crane (Grus nigricollis) were studied at Altun

   and other behavior (2.70 +/- 0.44\%). In addition, we also compared the
   behaviors of black-necked cranes in different periods and places. The
   results indicate that the diurnal time budgets of cranes in autumn in
   breeding area are more like the wintering budget in wintering area than
   breeding season in breeding area. Cranes changed their diurnal time

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Conventional laser-based powder bed fusion of metals (PBF-LB/M)
   currently faces technological challenges in scalability due to its low
   building rate and manufacturing throughput. One approach to address this
   issue is to parallelize multiple laser beams to increase processing
   flexibility. Recent research has studied, for instance, the improvements
   to mechanical properties of final products when using two or more laser
   beams in PBF-LB/M. However, some obstacles still need to be addressed
   involving the proximity of molten pools and their interaction mechanism.
   In particular, interactions between two close, parallel molten pools
   have not been fully understood yet. In this study, two lasers create two
   parallel-running molten pools with a small spatial offset in between.
   With different spatial offsets, experimental results reveal that besides
   the completely merged and completely separated regimes, there exists a
   new regime which yields periodic coalescence between the two molten
   pools. High-speed imaging shows two different mechanisms for the
   formation of such coalescence, what we denote as head-to-head and
   head-to-tail coalescence. By changing processing parameters including
   laser power and spatial offset, periodic structures with various
   wavelengths can be engineered using this dual-laser approach. (C) 2020

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{164}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{We previously reported that treatment with chondroitin sulfate from
   sturgeon bone (CSSB) promoted anti-apoptotic activity in hydrogen
   peroxide (H2O2)-treated chondrocytes and had a protective effect on
   mitochondria. It is known that cells can repair damaged mitochondria
   through autophagy, thus inhibiting the development of apoptosis.
   Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that CSSB treatment may inhibit
   chondrocyte apoptosis via regulation of autophagy. We observed the
   mitochondrial morphology of chondrocytes treated with different doses of
   CSSB, and confirmed that CSSB did not affect cell activity or cause
   damage to mitochondria. When compared with H2O2 treatment alone, CSSB
   treatment increased the clearance and repair of damaged mitochondria and
   promoted fusion of damaged mitochondria and lysosomes. CSSB treatment
   also increased the number of autolysosomes. However, these events could
   be blocked in chondrocytes pretreatedwith the autophagy inhibitor
   chloroquine, resulting in a decreased level of autophagy and increased
   apoptosis. These results suggest that CSSB treatment helps maintain
   intracellular homeostasis and prevent injury in chondrocytes treated
   with H2O2 by increasing autophagy. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   Evidence from the US and China (EGY 118745)}},
Journal = {{ENERGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{212}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{This study detects the relationship between the crude oil price (COP)
   and unemployment rate (UR) to explore whether the efficiency-wage model
   is consistent for the United States (U.S.) and China. It is unstable to
   use full-sample data in the long-run nexus with the consideration of
   structural changes, implying that causality is unreliable. Instead, the
   dynamic causal relationship is examined by a timevarying rolling-window
   method. In certain sub-periods, the existence of time-varying positive
   bidirectional causality between the COP and UR is illustrated by the
   empirical findings, supporting the efficiency-wage model indicating that
   these two variables can interact through supply, demand and inflation
   channels. For the U.S., deviations between the COP and UR can be
   explained by geopolitical events, monetary policy, financial crises and
   the shale oil revolution. In addition, the end of double-digit economic
   growth, financial crises and high oil demand lead to fluctuations in
   China for certain sub periods. Hence, for the government, these
   empirical findings have significant implications for identifying factors
   that bring about the causal link between the COP and UR and moreover
   lead to policy suggestions for U.S. and China. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{478}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Silicon monoxide (SiO) is considered an attractive alternative to
   conventional graphite anodes due to its high specific capacity and good
   cycling performance. However, it suffers from low initial Coulombic
   efficiency (ICE) due to a large irreversible capacity and large volume
   change during cycling. Both deficiencies hinder the commercial use of
   SiO anodes. A new organolithium compound
   (Li-9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluorene-tetrahydrofuran) with lower redox potential
   is reported to prelithiate a SiO-based anode. An SEI layer is formed
   during prelithiation and a controllable amount of reversible lithium is
   preloaded into the SiO electrode. The ICE of a prelithiated SiO-based
   electrode in half-cell format is increased greatly to similar to 90.7\%.
   When matched with a LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 cathode, the full cell with the
   prelithiated SiO/G anode exhibits a much improved ICE in comparison with
   the pristine one (87.1\% vs. 61.1\%). This facile prelithiation method
   is proved to be a practical solution for the commercial application of

Title = {{Machine learning materials physics: Multi-resolution neural networks
   learn the free energy and nonlinear elastic response of evolving
   microstructures}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{372}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Many important multi-component crystalline solids undergo
   mechanochemical spinodal decomposition: a phase transformation in which
   the compositional redistribution is coupled with structural changes of
   the crystal, resulting in dynamically evolving microstructures. The
   ability to rapidly compute the macroscopic behavior based on these
   detailed microstructures is of paramount importance for accelerating
   material discovery and design. Here, our focus is on the macroscopic,
   nonlinear elastic response of materials harboring microstructure.
   Because of the diversity of microstructural patterns that can form,
   there is interest in taking a purely computational approach to
   predicting their macroscopic response. However, the evaluation of
   macroscopic, nonlinear elastic properties purely based on direct
   numerical simulations (DNS) is computationally very expensive, and hence
   impractical for material design when a large number of microstructures
   need to be tested. A further complexity of a hierarchical nature arises
   if the elastic free energy and its variation with strain is a
   small-scale fluctuation on the dominant trajectory of the total free
   energy driven by microstructural dynamics. To address these challenges,
   we present a data driven approach, which combines advanced neural
   network (NN) models with DNS to predict the homogenized, macroscopic,
   mechanical free energy and stress fields arising in a family of
   multi-component crystalline solids that develop microstructure. The
   microstructures are numerically generated by solving a coupled,
   mechanochemical spinodal decomposition problem governed by nonlinear
   strain gradient elasticity and the Cahn-Hilliard phase field equation.
   The hierarchical structure of the free energy's evolution induces a

Title = {{Equilibrium concentration of hydrogen at tungsten surface}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{541}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{In this work, numerical calculations have been employed to investigate
   the adsorption equilibrium state of hydrogen (H) atoms on tungsten (W)
   surface. The surface energy and relevant surface atomic density of
   different W surfaces are obtained through the empirical-potential model.
   The calculations show that the higher surface atomic densities
   correspond to the more stable surfaces, of which the most stable surface
   is the W (110) surface. The H adsorption energies are systematically
   analyzed by density functional theory. The equilibrium concentration
   dependence for adsorption upon H coverage, a temperature range from 300
   K to 1100 K, and a pressure range from 10(-6) Pa to 10(6) Pa is examined
   by employing a Monte Carlo model. Our results suggest that most of H
   atoms desorb from 700 K to 1100 K when the pressure region varies from
   10(-6) Pa to 10(2) Pa. The monolayer-adsorbed H density is estimated
   from similar to 1.39 x 10(18) m(-2) to similar to 1.40 x 10(19) m(-2) at
   the equilibrium state. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{The instability of rock slopes and underground engineering is usually
   caused by the shear failure of non-persistent joints. Rock bolt, as the
   main support method, has an important influence on the shear behaviour
   of joints. However, the shear behaviour of bolted non-persistent joints
   has rarely been studied. In this research study, direct shear tests were
   carried out to explore the effect of different bolting schemes on shear
   behaviour of non-persistent joints. The test results showed that fully
   encapsulated bolts can greatly improve the shear strength of
   non-persistent joints, while end encapsulated bolts behave better at a
   larger shear displacement. The bolt breakage is closely related to the
   shear failure of non-persistent joints. The bolt passing through the
   coplanar coalescence areas usually has a larger shear deformation and
   breaks first. The shear displacement of bolt breakage tends to be
   smaller as the joint persistency decreases. Furthermore, acoustic
   emission tests showed that the fully encapsulated bolt noticeably
   reduced the shear damage, while it increased the shear failure
   intensity. In addition, the bolting effect tends to be smaller under a
   larger joint persistency.}},

Title = {{Distributionally robust optimization scheduling of electricity and
   natural gas integrated energy system considering confidence bands for
   probability density functions}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{123}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The rapid growth of gas-fired units and the development of power-to-gas
   (PtG) technology have strengthened the interdependency of power system
   and natural gas system and provided a new way for the absorption of
   renewable energy. This paper proposes a distributionally robust
   optimization (DRO) scheduling model for the electricity-gas coupled
   integrated energy system considering wind power uncertainty and PtG
   technology. Combining the advantages of stochastic programming and
   robust optimization, the proposed DRO model describes the uncertainty by
   an ambiguity set constructed based on the confidence bands of its
   probability density function, and aims to minimize the expectation of
   the re-dispatch cost under the worst-case distribution. Moreover, a
   novel affine adjustable strategy with the allocation ratio pairs is
   developed to enhance the flexibility of reserve configuration.
   Benefiting from the special structure of the ambiguity set, the proposed
   model with uncertainties can be reformulated as a mixed integer linear
   program problem to solve. Case studies are implemented on three coupled
   systems with different scales, and simulation results demonstrate that
   DRO with proposed affinely adjustable strategy can obtain the scheduling
   solution with lower conservatism and higher economical performance
   compared to the adjustable robust optimization and DRO with the single
   adjustment strategy.}},

   for the Overprint History of Hydrothermal Alteration and Supergenesis
   after Mineralization}},

Abstract = {{The newly discovered Shanzhuang BIF is hosted in the Shancaoyu Formation
   of the Taishan Group within the Eastern Block, southeastern margin of
   the North China Craton. The ores can be subdivided into three types in
   terms of mineral assemblages, corresponding to three types (I, II, III).
   The element concentration of the type I magnetite is similar to that of
   the type II magnetite, while the type III magnetite is similar to that
   of the schist. In general, magnetite and hematite grains from the ores
   show high concentrations of Mn (1317, 1162 ppm), Co (787, 1023 ppm), Al
   (2224, 2435 ppm) and Ti (540, 300 ppm), Whereas magnetite is depleted in
   Si (420 ppm) and hematite enriched in Si (1690 ppm). Detailed
   petrographic and mineral chemical analysis of magnetite, hematite,
   amphibole/hornblende and pyroxene, reveals that almost all the minerals
   occur as subhedral-anhedral grains with pits and fractures, and the BIF
   is recrystallized to metamorphic assemblages of high amphibolite facies.
   Hornblende is highly enriched in Fe, Mg and Ca, but depleted in K and
   Na, mostly belonging to magnesiohornblende. In addition, the ratios of
   Mg/(Mg+Fe2+), Fe3+/(Fe3++Fe2+), Si/(Si+Ti+Al) and Al/Si are 0.48-0.64,
   0.17-0.36, 0.79-0.88 and 0.14-0.27, respectively. It is suggested that
   hornblende is neither a typical magmatic origin nor a typical
   metamorphic. Pyroxene has the characteristics of high Ca and Fe, but low
   Ti and Al, with end-member components En, Wo and Fs in the ranges of
   25.22-28.64 wt\%, 43.71-46.40 wt\% and 24.51-27.62 wt\%, respectively,
   belonging to clinopyroxene, and mostly diopside, might be formed during
   the prograde metamorphism in the absence of H2O. The carbonate such as
   dolomite-ankerite series is probably a precursor mineral of the BIF
   deposit. Mass mineral chemical and structural characteristics indicate
   that the Shanzhuang iron deposit has been subjected to varying degrees
   of oxidized hydrothermal superimposed reformation, metamorphism, and
   supergenesis after mineralization, during which some elements have been
   migrated in some degree.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, oleylamine capped CuInSe2 (OAm-CISe) quantum dots (QDs)
   were synthesized with a modified hot injection method. The organic
   long-chain ligands attached on the surface of quantum dots have
   insulating properties, which affects the charge transport between the
   quantum dots. Thus the long-chain ligand on OAm-CISe surface was
   replaced by a short-chain ligand of 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) by
   phase transfer strategy. The MPA capped CISe (MPA-CISe) was applied as
   hole transport material to fabricated inverted perovskite solar cells
   (PSCs). The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs based on MPA-CISe
   increased to 8.59\% from 7.18\% for the PSCs based on OAm-CISe (7.18\%).
   The experimental results indicate that the PCE increase could be due to
   higher light transmission rate and conductivity of MPA-CISe film than
   the OAm-CISe film.}},

Abstract = {{Medical glue represents a suitable tool to stop wound bleeding, seal
   wounds, bond tissues, or implant materials. However, the development of
   a medical glue for durable underwater bonding remains a challenge.
   Herein, we developed a hydrophobic hyperbranched polymer-based medical
   glue with water-resistant bonding ability. Specifically, the
   hyperbranched polythioether (HBPTE) with abundant terminal thiol groups
   was first prepared through a simple one-pot thiol-Michael polyaddition
   reaction. Due to the hyperbranched molecular structure, HBPTE is a
   liquid material under room temperature, thus enabling the manufacturing
   of a photocurable HBPTE glue by the direct addition of poly(ethylene
   glycol) dimethacrylate and a photoinitiator without introduction of a
   solvent. This solventless HBPTE glue exhibited a maximum underwater
   adhesive strength of 36 kPa on porcine skin compared to only <10 kPa of
   the commercial fibrin glue and cyanoacrylate glue. Moreover, since the
   hydrophobic cross-linked network resists penetration of water, the HBPTE
   glue minimally swelled (2-10\%) and could maintain a glass sheet
   structure bonded together even after 2 weeks underwater. Furthermore, an
   in vitro cytotoxicity test showed that the HBPTE glue did not leak any
   cytotoxic substances and allowed for proliferation of L929 cells on its
   surface. Moreover, hemocompatibility tests indicated that the HBPTE glue
   was nonhemolytic and did not induce thrombosis. This HBPTE glue
   exhibited promising characteristics to potentially find use as an
   underwater soft tissue adhesive or sealant.}},

Title = {{Physiological responses of Arthrobacter sp. JQ-1 cell interfaces to
   co-existed di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and copper}},
Journal = {{ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{205}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Arthrobacter sp. JQ-1 can completely degrade 500 mg/L of DEHP within 3
   days. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of Cu2+ could reach
   1.56 mM, however, 5.0 mg/L Cu2+ apparently inhibited DEHP degradation
   and bacterial growth. Consequently, JQ-1 was exposed to the DEHP-copper
   environment to verify the toxicity mechanism based on the physiological
   responses of cellular multiple interfaces (cellular surface, membrane
   and intracellular characteristics). The results showed the combination
   of 500 mg/L DEHP and 5.0 mg/L Cu2+ significantly decreased cell surface
   hydrophobicity (CSH) and the absolute value of zeta potential, which
   implied the bioavailability of DEHP was decreased. The cellular surface
   changes were mainly due to the interaction between Cu2+ and some
   functional groups (CH2, CH3, aromatic rings, and amide). The weakened
   proton-motive force (PMF) across the plasma membrane may interfere the
   formation and utilization of energy, which is not conducive to the
   repair process of cellular damages. In this study, Non-invasive
   micro-test technology (NMT) was applied to the research of combined
   toxicity of DEHP and heavy metal ions for the first time. DEHP-copper
   intensified K+ efflux and Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane, which
   disturbed ion homeostasis of K+ and Ca2+ and might induce apoptosis and
   further inhibit DEHP degradation. The decline of intracellular esterase
   activity indicated that the metabolic capacity is apparently restrained.
   This study enhances our understanding of cellular different interface
   processes responding to combined pollutants.}},

Journal = {{SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{With the increasing requirement of precise humidity control in
   agriculture, industry, and scientific experiments, the humidity sensors
   based on porous materials such as metal-organic framework (MOF) have
   aroused much attention because of their high porosity and tunable
   structure. However, the reported MOFs exhibit narrow detecting range and
   long response time due to the absence of ion carriers in porous
   framework. In this paper, an ionic covalent organic framework (COF)
   named TpPa-SO3Na was synthesized, and its humidity sensing performance
   was investigated for the first time. TpPa-SO3Na with -SO3Na groups
   possesses a water adsorption capacity of 411 cm(3) g(-1), which is
   confirmed by water adsorption-desorption measurement. The sensor based
   on TpPa-SO3Na exhibits good impedance-RH linearity, rapid response
   characteristic (similar to 6 s) and narrow hysteresis (similar to 3\%
   RH) in the 11-95 \% RH. Moreover, the ionic COF sensing material
   presents good repeatability. These results strongly suggest ionic COFs
   are a class of promising candidates for humidity sensing applications.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon fiber-reinforced plastics (CFRP) composites are increasingly used
   in the aerospace and automotive industries due to their excellent
   properties, which require higher processing accuracy to ensure their

   the ``element birth and death{''} technique in the finite element
   method, the three-dimensional transient temperature field of
   heterogeneous fiber matrix and the subsequent material removal model are
   established. The results show that the CFRP composites processed by
   water jet-guided laser processing can obtain better processing results

Journal = {{PLANT SCIENCE}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Allocation of more resources to growth but less to defense causing
   growth vigor of invasive alien plant populations contributes to
   successful invasion. However, few studies has addressed to relationship
   between vascular development variation and this mechanism. In this
   study, a common garden experiment was established to compare the growth
   and vascular bundle development between native and introduced
   populations of Solidago canadensis, which is a wide-distributed invasive
   species in China. Our results suggested that the rapid growth of
   introduced populations could be explained by the well-developed and
   highly lignified xylem; while native populations present more developed
   and highly lignified phloem, which contributed more resistance to the
   infection of Sclerotiun rofsii compared with introduced populations.
   This difference was resulted from tissue-specific tradeoff distribution
   of lignification related gene expression between xylem and phloem, which
   is regulated by upstream MYB transcription factors. Our study gives a
   novel insight of mechanism that explain invasion success: lignin-related
   gene transcription-mediated tissue-specific lignification of vascular
   bundle contributes tradeoffs in resource allocation between growth and
   defence capacity during successful invasion of S. canadensis.}},

Title = {{Multi-state semi-Markov modeling of recurrent events: Estimating driver
   waiting time at semi-controlled crosswalks}},
Journal = {{ANALYTIC METHODS IN ACCIDENT RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{28}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{At ``semi-controlled{''} crosswalks, signs and markings are present, but
   delay to pedestrians and motorists is largely the result of the
   ``negotiation{''} between the two parties to determine who yields. This
   paper proposes a novel approach using multi-state semi-Markov models to
   investigate motorists' delay and their interactions with pedestrians.
   Motorist waiting behavior can be divided into a series of gap acceptance
   decisions as part of a Markov Chain. Each gap acceptance decision is
   modeled as a specific transition between two states in the Markov Chain.
   To demonstrate the reliability of the proposed models, multi-state
   semi-Markov models are estimated for the waiting behavior of more than
   1,000 drivers in the presence of pedestrians at semi-controlled
   crosswalks. The multi-state semi-Markov models are capable of dealing
   with specific challenges related to (i) the need to account for
   recurrent events and (ii) a generalized framework for vehicle delay
   estimation and simulation at semi controlled crosswalks. The extent to
   which motorists behave more aggressively and impatiently as their delay
   increases is demonstrated. Differences in behavior for operators of
   buses and trucks were also identified. The semi-Markov method is also
   able to deal effectively with the ``pulsing{''} arrival patterns of
   pedestrians at crosswalks as university classes begin and end nearby and
   handle temporal heterogeneity. Finally, to address aggressive driver
   behavior, several safety implications are discussed. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Title = {{Radiological-prognostic correlation of diffusion tensor imaging in a
   mild traumatic brain injury model}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters can detect changes in the
   brain microstructure in mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Whether
   these parameter changes can predict neural functional recovery after
   mTBI is still relatively unknown. The present study aimed to investigate
   the radiological-prognostic correlation between these radiological
   parameters and learning and memory deficits using an in-house
   constructed rat model of mTBI. We established a rat model of diffuse
   axonal injury (DAI) at different injury levels, followed by magnetic
   resonance imaging at 6, 24, and 72 h, and 1, 2 weeks post injury, and
   randomly selected the rats for analysis of histopathology and learning
   and memory deficits. DTI parameters and beta -amyloid precursor protein
   (beta -APP) levels were obtained to estimate the extent of brain injury
   and the correlation with the times of crossing the safety platform as
   measured using a water maze test. The results revealed that fractional
   anisotropy (FA) was sensitive to axonal integrity. FA values of the
   corpus callosum in the injury groups decreased at all time points post
   injury, except in the mild injury group, which recovered to normal
   levels at 1 and 2 weeks post-injury. The neural function of the mild
   injury group recovered to normal compared with the normal control group.
   FA value, beta -APP of corpus callosum in different groups at 24 h post
   injury showed obvious correlation with learning and memory deficits at
   the recovery stage (r=0.881, r=-0.931). In conclusion, DTI can reflect
   varying injury states of DAI over time with direct comparison to
   histopathology and could be used to predict the neural functional
   recovery at the early stage post-injury in a rat model.}},

Abstract = {{The propeller cavitation not only affects the propulsive efficiency of a
   ship but also can cause vibration and noise. Accurate predictions of
   propeller cavitation are crucial at the design stage. This paper
   investigates the feasibility of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes
   (RANS) method in predicting propeller cavitation in behind-hull
   conditions, focusing on four aspects: (i) grid sensitivity; (ii) the
   time step effect; (iii) the turbulence model effect; and (iv) ability to
   rank two slightly different propellers. The Schnerr-Sauer model is
   adopted as the cavitation model. A model test is conducted to validate
   the numerical results. Good agreement on the cavitation pattern is
   obtained between the model test and computational fluid dynamics. Two
   propellers are computed, which have similar geometry but slightly
   different pitch ratios. The results show that RANS is capable of
   correctly differentiating the cavitation patterns between the two
   propellers in terms of the occurrence of face cavitation and the extent
   of sheet cavitation; moreover, time step size is found to slightly
   affect sheet cavitation and has a significant impact on the survival of
   the tip vortex cavitation. It is also observed that grid refinement is
   crucial for capturing tip vortex cavitation and the two-equation
   turbulence models used - realizable k-epsilon and shear stress transport
   (SST) k-omega - yield similar cavitation results.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to observe the effect of microRNA-7 on the
   proliferation and migration of human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line
   SMMC-7721 and its effect on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eukaryotic expression vector
   pcDNA3.1(-)-pri-miR-7(p-miR-7) was used to instantaneously transfect
   human liver cancer cells of SMMC-7721 cells in vitro. The expression of
   microRNA-7 was detected by RT-qPCR. Western blot was used to detect the
   expression of EMT marker proteins E-cadherin, beta-catenin, N-cadherin
   and Vimentin. The proliferation of SMMC-7721 cells was detected by CCK-8
   assay, and the invasion and migration ability of cells was detected by
   transwell assay.
   RESULTS: Compared with the normal group, the expressions of E-cadherin
   and beta-catenin in SMMC-7721 cells transfected with miR-7 were
   significantly increased (p<0.05), while the expressions of N-cadherin
   and Vimentin were significantly decreased (p<0.05). Meanwhile, the
   proliferation, invasion and migration ability of the cells were
   significantly weakened (p<0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: The miR-7 can inhibit the proliferation and invasion of
   human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line SMMC-7721, and its mechanism
   may be related to upregulation of E-cadherin, beta-catenin protein, and
   downregulation of N-cadherin and Vimentin proteins.}},

Title = {{Thoracic paravertebral involvement in patients with IgG4-related
   disease: CT and MR imaging findings}},
Journal = {{RHEUMATOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{59}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objectives. To retrospectively evaluate CT and magnetic resonance (MR)
   imaging thoracic paravertebral findings at baseline and follow-up in
   patients with IgG4-related disease.
   Methods. The study consisted of 36 patients with IgG4-related disease
   involving thoracic paravertebral regions (32 men and four women; mean
   age, 58 years; range, 25-78years). A total of 36 patients underwent CT
   or MR imaging at baseline; 20 patients underwent follow-up. CT and MR
   images were reviewed and analysed in consensus by two radiologists for
   the various features of thoracic paravertebral lesions.
   Results. All lesions were located around two or more thoracic vertebrae,
   particularly the lower thoracic vertebrae (n = 36) . The right side of
   vertebrae was predominantly affected in all cases (n = 36) .
   Radiologically, IgG4-related thoracic paravertebral lesions were
   categorized into three types: solitary or multiple saddle-like masses
   type (32 patients); multiple nodules type (three patients); and
   invasively irregular mass type (three patients). All the types showed
   soft-tissue density on CT images, isointense on T1- and T2-weighted
   images, and homogeneous enhancement with penetration of small arteries
   in the lesions on contrast-enhanced CT and MR images. Steroid therapy
   administered to 20 patients dramatically diminished the mean maximum
   thickness in 18 patients. One patient with T7-12 vertebrae involved
   improved after steroid therapy.
   Conclusion. IgG4-related paravertebral lesions occur mainly around the
   right side of the lower thoracic vertebrae and manifest as three major
   patterns of CT and MR imaging findings. Recognition of these diagnostic
   features will assist in the diagnosis and treatment of IgG4-related
   disease.}},

Title = {{Spherical carrier amplification strategy for electrochemical

   determination of tacrolimus}},
Journal = {{TALANTA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{220}},

Abstract = {{A novel sensitive electrochemical immunosensor has been designed for
   determination of tacrolimus (Tac) based on spherical carrier
   amplification strategy. In this work, a spherical signal carrier was
   prepared by conjugating gold nanorods (AuNRs) functionalized L-cysteine
   (AuNRs@L-Cys) onto polystyrene nanoparticles (PS) to form a
   nanostructure, greatly increasing the amount of loaded capture
   antibodies. The PS was a stable spherical functional polymer with large
   specific surface area and was labeled with AuNRs@L-Cys via coupling
   reagent to increase active groups, biocompatibility and conductivity.
   The capture antibodies could be attached on the PS-AuNRs@L-Cys via
   linkage reagent glutaraldehyde (GA). Furthermore, single-layer
   molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) fixed by chitosan were utilized to construct
   the base of this immunosensor, increasing the carrying capacity and
   stability of the electrode. After electrochemical reduction, the
   conductivity and electron transfer rate of MoS2 were obviously improved,
   which offered a platform for this immunosensor and further amplified the
   signal. Under the optimized conditions, the proposed immunosensor
   revealed a linear Tac-concentration behavior from 1.0 to 30 ng mL(-1)
   with a detection limit of 0.17 ng mL(-1) (S/N = 3). The immunoassay was
   successfully applied to the quantification of Tac in serum samples with
   acceptable precision. The results indicated that a potentially
   analytical platform may be used to recognize the concentration of other
   drugs.}},

Abstract = {{Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) is a
   serious disease that has a high risk of death among infants and
   teenagers. Acetylharpagide, a natural compound of Ajuga decumbens Thunb.
   (family Labiatae), has been found to have anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory
   and anti-viral effects. This study investigates the therapeutic effects
   of acetylharpagide on S. aureus-induced ALI in mice. Here, we found that
   acetylharpagide alleviated S. aureus-induced lung pathological
   morphology damage, protected the pulmonary blood-gas barrier and
   improved the survival of S. aureus-infected mice. Furthermore, S.
   aureus-induced myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity of lung homogenate and
   pro-inflammatory factors in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were
   suppressed by acetylharpagide. Mechanically, acetylharpagide inhibited
   the interaction between polyubiquitinated receptor interacting protein 1
   (RIP1) and NF-kappa B essential modulator (NEMO), thereby suppressing
   NF-kappa B activity. In summary, these results show that acetylharpagide
   protects mice from S. aureus-induced ALI by suppressing the NF-kappa B
   signaling pathway. Acetylharpagide is expected to become a potential
   treatment for S. aureus-induced ALI.}},

Abstract = {{SiC was modified by fluorine-containing organic substance
   1H,1H,2H,2H-trifluoro-noctyltriethoxysilane (FAS) to change its
   hydrophilicity from hydrophilic to superhydrophobic nanoparticles, and
   the optimum conditions for hydrophobicity were effectively explored.
   Then, different content of fluorine-modified SiC (F-SiC) nanoparticles
   were added to the epoxy resin (EP) matrix to prepare composite coating
   samples. The results showed that the surface of SiC was modified by FAS
   to show superhydrophobicity, and the dispersion in EP was significantly
   improved. After adding F-SiC, the hydrophobicity, wear resistance and
   corrosion resistance of the coating were significantly improved. In
   addition, the corrosion resistance of the composite coating containing
   different contents of F-SiC was analyzed through electrochemical and
   salt spray tests. The results showed that the corrosion resistance of
   the coating was the best when the addition amount was 3 wt \%. In
   general, the composite coating with 3 wt \% F-SiC had the best overall
   performance. Compared with the EP coating, the water contact angle of 3
   wt \% F-SiC/EP composite coating was increased by 62.9\%, the friction
   coefficient was reduced by 73.5\%, and the corrosion current was reduced
   by three orders of magnitude. This study provides a new idea for the
   development of ultra-wear-resistant and anti-fouling heavy-duty

   analysis confirmed that PARP1 is expressed at lower levels in
   TKI-sensitive cells than in TKI-resistant cells. Low PARP1 expression
   and high p62 expression were associated with good outcomes among
   patients with NSCLC after TKI therapy. AZD2281 and a lysosomal inhibitor
   reversed resistance to Ico by decreasing PARP1 and LC3 in cells, but an
   mTOR inhibitor did not decrease Ico resistance. The combination of
   AZD2281 and Ico exerted a markedly enhanced antitumor effect by reducing
   PARP1 expression and autophagy in vivo. Knockdown of PARP1 expression
   reversed the resistance to TKI by the mTOR/Akt/autophagy pathway in
   HCC-827IR, H1975, and H1299 cells. PARP1-mediated autophagy is a key
   pathway for TKI resistance in NSCLC cells that participates in the
   resistance to TKIs. Olaparib may serve as a novel method to overcome the
   resistance to TKIs.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a new group decision making (GDM) method based
   on the acceptable multiplicative consistency and consensus of hesitant
   fuzzy linguistic preference relations (HFLPRs). First, an approach for
   improving the consistency of HFLPRs is proposed to generate an
   acceptable multiplicative consistent HFLPR. Then, a consensus index of
   HFLPRs is defined and an optimization model is presented to meet an
   acceptable consensus requirement under the premise of the acceptable
   multiplicative consistency and the smallest information loss, where it
   yields adjusted HFLPRs with an acceptable consistency and consensus.
   Then, the weights of decision makers (DMs) are calculated based on the
   obtained adjusted HFLPRs. Moreover, we propose a new GDM method based on
   HFLPRs. Finally, the proposed GDM method is illustrated by an
   application example and comparative analyses are conducted to show the
   performance and the superiority of the proposed GDM method. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{Limited studies focus on the occurrence, removal rate and seasonal
   variation of substituted diphenyl-amine antioxidants (SDPAs) in surface
   water and wastewater in China. In this paper, the detection method of
   SDPAs was established by the ultra-performance liquid
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Daily variations suggested that
   significant variations were found for the concentrations of some SDPAs
   in the influent. It was found that the SDPAs could be detected in all
   the effluent samples and C8/C8-DPA was the predominant compound in two
   WWTPs. The levels of most SDPAs in the effluent were much lower than
   that of influent, with the removal efficiencies of total SDPAs ranged
   from 57.9\% to 84.2\%. There were significant differences with the SDPA
   concentrations in the influent between different seasons. Higher
   concentrations of SDPAs were found at downstream than those of upstream.
   The results of this study provide more environmental occurrence data and
   new insights into the research on the environmental fate of these

Abstract = {{The polyandrous mating behavior of the honeybee queen increases the

   particular subfamilies tend to have a genetic predisposition for tasks
   preference. In this study, we intended to understand whether there is
   nepotism in dance communication of honeybees during natural conditions.
   Microsatellite DNA analyses revealed a total of fourteen and twelve
   subfamilies in two colonies. The subfamily composition of the dancer and
   the followers did not deviate from random. The majority of the
   subfamilies did not show kin recognition in dance-recruit communication
   in honeybee colonies, but some subfamilies showed significant nepotism
   for workers to follow their super-sister dancer. Because it seems
   unlikely that honeybee would change the tendency to follow dancers due
   to the degree of relatedness, we conclude that honeybees randomly follow
   a dancer in order to e benefit colony gain and development.}},

Title = {{Detecting the Early Damages in Structures With Nonlinear Output

Abstract = {{Frames, shells, and hybrid structures with early damages, such as early
   cracks, often behave as extremely weak nonlinear systems, among which
   the nonlinearity is difficult to be detected, especially if the system
   response is affected by the noise. To avoid these damages becoming
   catastrophic failures, developing effective incipient damages detection
   methods is important. The nonlinear output frequency response functions
   (NOFRFs) and associated indexes can be considered as one kind of the
   prospective detection tools, which are usually determined from the
   established nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs (NARX) model.
   However, the hyperparameters in the NARX model are difficult to be
   determined so that the identification accuracy cannot be guaranteed.
   Therefore, it is important to develop more accurate methods to estimate
   the NOFRFs and their associated indicators for damage detection.
   Motivated by the powerful learning abilities of convolutional neural
   networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, a novel
   method based on NOFRFs and the CNN-LSTM model for detecting the early
   damages in structures is proposed. By applying the beat excitation, the
   response of the structure is divided into two components, where the
   approximately linear component is used to estimate the frequency
   characteristic of the linear component by the classical linear model and
   the nonlinear component is used to establish the CNN-LSTM model. By
   calculating the responses of the two models, the NOFRFs and associated
   indexes can be accurately estimated, and then the early damage can be
   detected. Simulation and experimental studies verify the potential and
   effectiveness of the novel method proposed in this article.}},

Title = {{Improved optical tomography based on hybrid frequency-domain and
   time-domain radiative transfer model}},
Journal = {{INFRARED PHYSICS \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{111}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Based on the hybrid frequency-domain (FD) and time-domain (TD) radiative
   transfer equation (RTE), a novel reconstruction strategy is developed to
   retrieve the optical parameter fields in the participating medium. The
   discrete ordinate method is employed to solve the forward FD and TD RTE
   to simulate the radiative transfer process. The sequential quadratic
   programming is utilized to solve the inverse problem for obtaining the
   optical parameters combined with an adjoint method. The Otsu algorithm
   is applied to the FD reconstructed results to distinguish the target
   region and the background region. To overcome the ill-posedness of the
   inverse problem, the generalized Gaussian Markov random field model is
   employed as the regularization term in the objective function. Various
   numerical experiments are studied and all results demonstrate that the
   proposed hybrid reconstruction scheme is suitable for efficient and
   accurate optical tomography by combining the FD and TD radiative
   transfer models. Meanwhile, the crosstalk of the ill-posed inverse
   problem can be alleviated effectively.}},

   attachment, this study explored how and when paternal coparenting
   behavior is related to adolescent prosocial behaviors. Eight hundred and
   ninety Chinese adolescents from nuclear families filled out
   questionnaires regarding paternal coparenting behavior, prosocial
   behaviors, father-child attachment, mother-child attachment, and peer
   attachment. Results showed that (1) Positive paternal coparenting
   behavior (coparenting integrity and consistency) was positively
   associated with adolescent prosocial behaviors, while negative paternal
   coparenting behavior (coparenting conflict and bias) was not
   significantly associated with adolescent prosocial behaviors; (2)
   Coparenting integrity was positively related to father-child attachment,
   while coparenting conflict was negatively related to father-child
   attachment, which supported spillover effect in family system;
   coparenting integrity and consistency were both positively related to
   mother-child attachment, while coparenting conflict was negatively
   related to mother-child attachment, which supported crossover effect in
   family system; (3) Mother-child attachment and peer attachment
   sequentially mediated the association between coparenting integrity and
   adolescent prosocial behaviors only for girls but not boys; (4) Peer
   attachment mediated the association between coparenting consistency and
   prosocial behaviors in both boy and girl groups. The results stressed
   the role of positive paternal coparenting behaviors in adolescent
   prosocial behaviors and encouraged to enhance the coparenting practice
   to foster adolescent positive development.}},

Abstract = {{In order to investigate the influence of microstructure evolution on
   corrosion resistance of amorphous Ni-Mo-P coating, the amorphous Ni-Mo-P
   coating was prepared by electroless plating method, and then five
   coatings with different microstructure were obtained by heat treatment
   at 250. for different time. The local atomic structure of these coatings
   were analyzed by XRD patterns and the corresponding atomic pair
   distribution functions. TEM results were used to analyze coatings
   microstructure. The proportion of microscopic particles and order
   clusters in amorphous matrix was rough estimated through the DSC
   exothermic peak areas. Corrosion resistance in 0. 5 mol/ L sulfuric acid
   solution was investigated via electrochemical techniques and the
   corrosive products were evaluated by XPS method. Results show that all
   annealed coatings still remain amorphous structure, as a contrast, the
   microstructures are changed. With the heating time increased, the
   content of microscopic particles and order clusters inside the matrix is
   increasing, and more types of crystal phases appeare. Meanwhile, the
   decreasing of corrosion resistance of these coatings is in agreement
   with the extension of heating time.}},

Title = {{Notoginsenoside R1 alleviates oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced
   apoptosis, inflammatory response, and oxidative stress in HUVECS through
   modulation of XIST/miR-221-3p/TRAF6 axis}},
Journal = {{CELLULAR SIGNALLING}},

Abstract = {{Background:: Atherosclerosis is a common reason for acute
   cardio-cerebral vascular diseases. The purpose of this study was to
   clarify the functional effects of Notoginsenoside R1 (NGR1) on
   atherosclerosis.
   Methods: HUVECS were exposed to oxidized low-density lipoprotein
   (ox-LDL) in the current study. The proliferation ability of HUVECS was
   measured by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,
   5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazol-3-ium bromide (MTT). Flow cytometry assays were
   performed to evaluate the apoptosis of HUVECS. Ox-LDL caused
   inflammatory response and oxidative stress were assessed by checking
   pro-inflammatory cytokines and intracellular reactive oxygen species
   (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). The
   regulatory roles of NGR1 in HUVECs were measured by real-time
   quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot
   assays. The interaction relationship between miR-221-3p and X-inactive
   specific transcript (XIST) or TNF-receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)
   was predicted by bioinformatics tools. Dual-luciferase reporter and RNA
   pull-down assays were used to confirm the interaction relationship.
   Results: Currently, ox-LDL inhibited proliferation and induced
   apoptosis, inflammatory response, and oxidative stress in HUVECs, which
   were alleviated by treatment with NGR1. Importantly, the increase of
   XIST in ox-LDL-induced HUVECs was abolished by NGR1. In addition, the
   gain-of-functional experiment suggested that the upregulation of XIST
   neutralized the protection effects of NGR1 in HUVECs treated with
   ox-LDL. In addition, miR-221-3p was a target of XIST in HUVECs as
   confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assays.
   Furthermore, miR-221-3p interacted with TRAF6, and NGR1 regulated
   proliferation, apoptosis, inflammatory response, and oxidative stress in
   HUVECs exposed to ox-LDL by regulation of the XIST/miR-221-3p/TRAF6 axis
   through Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF-kappa B) pathway.
   Conclusion: NGR1 could exert regulatory functions in ox-LDL-induced
   HUVECS by regulation of XIST/miR-2213p/TRAF6 axis, which provided
   valuable insights into the development of potential therapeutic strategy
   for atherosclerosis.}},

Abstract = {{Neuromorphic engineering promises the deployment of low latency,
   adaptive and low power systems that can lead to the design of truly
   autonomous artificial agents. However, many building blocks for
   developing a fully neuromorphic artificial agent are still missing.
   While neuromorphic sensing, perception, and decision-making building
   blocks are quite mature, the ones for motor control and actuation are
   lagging behind. In this paper we present a closed-loop motor controller
   implemented on a mixed-signal analog/digital neuromorphic processor
   which emulates a spiking neural network that continuously calculates an
   error signal from the desired target and the feedback signals. The
   system uses population coding and recurrent Winner-Take-All networks to
   encode the signals robustly. Recurrent connections within each
   population are used to speed up the convergence, decrease the effect of
   mismatch and improve selectivity. The error signal computed in this way
   is then fed into three additional populations of spiking neurons which
   produce the proportional, integral and derivative terms of classical
   controllers exploiting the temporal dynamics of the network synapses and
   neurons. To validate this approach we interfaced this neuromorphic motor
   controller with an iCub robot simulator. We tested our spiking
   controller in a single joint control task for the robot head yaw. We
   demonstrate the correct performance of the spiking controller in a step
   response experiment and apply it to a target pursuit task.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) modified by a new organic nucleating agent,
   N,N'-dodecanedioic bis(piperonylic acid) dihydrazide (BPADD), was
   fabricated, and its crystallization, melting behavior, thermal
   stability, fluidity and mechanical properties were investigated. The
   melt-crystallization behavior proved that BPADD could bring about a fast
   nucleation rate to promote the crystallization of PLLA; 2 wt\% BPADD
   exhibited the best crystallization accelerating effect due to having the
   highest crystallization onset temperature and the highest
   melt-crystallization temperature. However, PLLA/3\% BPADD had the
   largest melt-crystallization enthalpy. In addition, the frontier orbital
   energy indicated that the nucleation effect of BPADD on PLLA might be
   attributed to intermolecular interaction. The melt crystallization also
   depended on two critical factors, the cooling rate and final melting
   temperature. An increase in BPADD content led to greater inhibition of
   crystal growth during cold crystallization. The differences in the
   melting behavior of PLLA/BPADD samples reflected the previous
   crystallization process, the heating rate and BPADD content. BPADD was
   harmful to maintaining the thermal stability of PLLA; however, the
   intermolecular interaction could prevent the decomposition onset
   temperature from continuously decreasing. The usage of BPADD resulted in
   better fluidity and higher tensile strength; the tensile modulus and
   elongation at break were associated with BPADD content.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the weighted coordinated motion of coupled
   harmonic oscillators over weighted cooperative-competitive interactions.
   First, the traditional synchronisation and containment control concepts
   are extended to the weighted synchronisation and weighted containment
   control for the new cooperative-competitive networks. Then, weighted
   synchronisation problem and weighted containment tracking motion are
   respectively solved for the coupled harmonic oscillators. Compared with
   some existing results, the frequency parameters of coupled harmonic
   oscillators are unknown in this paper and some novel networked
   structures are introduced in order to make the harmonic oscillator
   followers converge to the convex hull spanned by leaders' weighted
   states. Particularly, if the topologies formed by every leader group and
   follower group are interactively balanced and every follower is
   weight-product balanced, or if some leader groups are not interactively
   balanced but satisfy some conditions, the coupled harmonic oscillators
   can all realise the weighted containment tracking motion. Simulation
   results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   control schemes.}},

Title = {{Salivary microbial changes during the first 6 months of orthodontic
   treatment}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Background. Orthodontic treatment is widely used to treat malocclusion.
   However, the influence of treatment on the oral microbiome remains
   unclear. In this study, we investigated salivary microbial changes in
   patients undergoing orthodontic treatment.
   Methods. In total, 19 orthodontic patients participated in this study.
   Saliva samples were collected at the following three timepoints: before
   (T0) and 3 months (T1) and 6 months (T2) after the placement of
   orthodontic appliances. High-throughput sequencing was performed based
   on the 16S rRNA gene V4 region.
   Results. The phyla of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes,
   Actinobacteria and Fusobacteria were predominant. Observed Species,
   Chaol and ACE, which represent alpha diversity, were significantly
   decreased at T1 and subsequently increased at T2. In addition, the beta
   diversity at T1 based on the Bray-Curtis distances differed from T0 and
   T2. The relative abundances of Prevotella, Porphyromonas and
   Peptostreptococcus were decreased with treatment, whereas those of
   Capnocytophaga and Neisseria exhibited the opposite results. In total,
   385 of 410 operational taxonomic units were shared at T0, T1 and T2. The
   co-occurrence networks with hub nodes at T1 were the most complex.
   Conclusion. Orthodontic treatment temporarily affected the saliva
   microbial community. This dynamic alteration in species did not induce
   deterioration in oral health. Oral hygiene instructions were necessary
   and should be emphasized during each visit. Further studies with longer
   observation periods and more participants are required.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a fiber optic Fabry-Perot (F-P) cavity high pressure
   sensor used in oil wells is presented. An F-P cavity probe encapsulated
   by silica capillary was fabricated through oxy-hydrogen flame welding,
   and the F-P cavity was fully sealed with adhesive-free bonding. A spiral
   tube filled with silicone oil was chosen to prevent the probe from
   directly contacting with down-hole corrosion fluid and to transfer
   pressure. A fiber Bragg grating was linked with the F-P cavity probe to
   measure ambient temperature for the probe's temperature compensation.
   The sensing pressure can be as high as 82 MPa with a sensitivity of 241
   nm/MPa, a repeatability of 0.05\% F.S.(full scale), a resolution of
   0.0004 MPa with the temperature ranging from room temperature to 175
   degrees C. Besides, the maximum fluctuation of the F-P cavity length can
   be as small as about 0.0072 MPa within 40 days at the pressure and
   temperature of 42 MPa and 130 degrees C. In addition, this kind of
   sensor has been used in Shengli Oil Field.}},

Abstract = {{Maritime shipping is a key component of the global economy, representing
   80-90\% of international trade. To deal with the energy crisis and
   marine environmental pollution, hydrogen-natural gas-diesel tri-fuel
   engines have become an attractive option for use in the maritime
   industry. In this study, numerical simulations and experimental tests
   were used to evaluate the effects of different hydrogen ratios on the
   combustion and emissions from these engines. The results show that, in
   terms of combustion performance, as the hydrogen proportion increases,
   the combustion ignition delay time in the cylinder decreases and the
   laminar flame speed increases. The pressure and temperature in the
   cylinder increase and the temperature field distribution expands more
   rapidly with a higher hydrogen ratio. This means that the tri-fuel
   engine (H-2+CH4+Diesel) has a faster response and better power
   performance than the dual fuel engine (CH4+Diesel). In terms of emission
   performance, as the hydrogen proportion increases, the NO emissions
   increase, and CO and CO2 emissions decrease. If factors such as methane
   escape into the atmosphere from the engine are considered, the
   contribution of marine tri-fuel engines to reducing ship exhaust
   emissions will be even more significant. Therefore, this study shows
   that marine hydrogen-natural gas-diesel tri-fuel engines have
   significant application and research prospects.}},

Title = {{Quantitative Estimation of Soil-Ground Water Storage Utilization during
   the Crop Growing Season in Arid Regions with Shallow Water Table Depth}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Water storage in unsaturated and saturated zones during the crop
   non-growing season is one of the important supplementary water resources
   to meet crop water requirements in arid areas with shallow water table
   depth. It is necessary to analyze utilization of the soil-ground water
   storage during the crop growing season and its attribution to irrigation
   during the non-growing season. To facilitate the analysis, a new method
   based on measurements of soil moisture content and water table depth is
   developed. The measurements used in this study include (1) 15-year data
   of soil moisture content within a depth of 1 m from the land surface and
   water table depth measured in Jiefangzha, including its four subareas
   and (2) 4-year data of the same kind in Yonglian, located in arid
   northern China. The soil-ground water storage utilization is calculated
   as the difference of water storage between the beginning and end of the
   crop growing season in the whole computational soil profile. The results
   of average soil-ground water storage utilization in Jiefangzha and its
   four subareas and Yonglian are 121 mm, 126 mm, 113 mm, 124 mm, 185 mm
   and 117 mm, and the corresponding average utilization efficiencies in
   the non-growing season are 32.2\%, 32.5\%, 31.5\%, 31.6\%, 57.3\% and
   47.6\%, respectively. Further, the water table fluctuation method was
   used to estimate the variation in water storage. The coefficients of
   soil-ground water storage utilization, soil-ground water storage
   utilization below 1 m soil depth and ground water utilization are
   defined, and their average values are 0.271, 0.111 and 0.026 in
   Jiefangzha, respectively. Then, the contribution of soil-ground water
   storage utilization to actual evapotranspiration is evaluated, which are
   over 23.5\% in Jiefangzha and Yonglian. These results indicate that the
   soil-ground water storage plays an important role in the ecological
   environment in arid areas with shallow water table depth.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Scale criterion has been proposed for tunnel fires, however, some
   parameters are usually not feasible to be implemented. In this study,
   numerical and experimental simulations have been performed to validate
   the scale criterion. First, the wall thickness parameter was studied
   since it plays an important role in the heat conduction. The results of
   the simulations were compared with Hu's full-scale experimental data.
   Then, the other ambient temperature and wall materials parameters were
   investigated through the numerical simulations. Furthermore, a series of
   experiments were conducted in two reduced-scale tunnel tables. The
   simulation results showed that when the ambient temperature varied with
   the scale criterion, the decay speed of the dimensionless smoke
   temperature for the 1/18 scale becomes a little smaller. Experimental
   results showed that the decay speed of dimensionless temperature rises
   if both the asbestos and steel board was smaller. However, the decay
   speed in the cases of steel boards was larger than that of the
   simulation results. Moreover, when the aluminum silicate board was used
   as the wall material, the results of numerical simulations agreed well
   with experiments in the near-field. But when x/H > 4, the decay speed of
   dimensionless temperature rise for experiments was larger than numerical
   simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are ubiquitously distributed
   persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in marine environments.
   Phytoplankton are the entrance of PBDEs entering to biotic environments
   from abiotic environments, while the responding mechanisms of
   phytoplankton to PBDEs have not been full established. Therefore, we
   chose the model diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana in this study, by
   integrating whole transcriptome analysis with physiological-biochemical
   data, to reveal the molecular responding mechanisms of T. pseudonana to
   the toxicity of BDE-47. Our results indicated the changes of genes
   expressions correlated to the physiological biochemical changes, and
   there were multiple molecular mechanisms of T. pseudonana responding to
   the toxicity of BDE-47: Gene expressions evidence explained the
   suppression of light reaction and proved the occurrence of cellular
   oxidative stress; In the meanwhile, up-regulations of genes in pathways
   involving carbon metabolisms happened, including the Calvin cycle,
   glycolysis, TCA cycle, fatty acid synthesis, and triacylglycerol
   synthesis; Lastly, DNA damage was found and three outcome including DNA
   repair, cell cycle arrest and programmed cell death (PCD) happened,
   which could finally inhibit the cell division and population growth of
   T. pseudonana. This study presented the most complete molecular
   responding mechanisms of phytoplankton cells to PBDEs, and provided
   valuable information of various PBDEs-sensitive genes with multiple
   functions for further research involving organic pollutants and

Title = {{Quantification of pore modification in coals due to pulverization using
   synchrotron small angle X-ray scattering}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) has been widely employed to
   characterize the pore structure of coal and other geomaterials. However,
   in the many previous experimental investigations by SAXS, the probed
   samples were not standardized in terms of shape and particle size, even
   for the same geomaterial. The influence of pulverization on the pore
   structure of coal is generally ignored by the researchers using SAXS for
   structure characterization. In this study, SAXS is used to investigate
   the effect of pulverizing on pore modification of virgin coal. Two kinds
   of coal with different ranks were selected and pulverized for SAXS
   measurements. Both powder samples (five particle size fractions)
   obtained by grinding and slice samples were investigated. The results
   show that the nano-pore structure of coal has been significantly
   modified due to pulverization. The sample pore volume per unit mass
   increases with the decrease of sample particle size. Pulverizing the
   slice sample into the minimum particle sample particle size of
   0.075-0.125 mm leads to an increase in the pore volume per unit mass of
   coal by 39.53\% and 18.29\% for tested medium volatile bituminous coal
   and anthracite, respectively. Pulverization can reduce the volume of
   smaller pores (20 nm) and increase the volume of larger pores (20 nm).
   After grinding the original sample into the minimum particle size of
   0.075-0.125 mm, the fractal dimension of the tested medium volatile
   bituminous coal and anthracite decreased by 0.266 and 0.179,
   respectively. Surface fractal dimension of pore decreases with the
   reduction in coal particle size. In the case of the powder coal sample,
   the increase in pore volume (especially for pore greater than 20 nm) and
   the reduction of fractal dimension are beneficial to the diffusion of
   gas in coal and promoting the desorption of residual gas. This study may
   provide a quantitative insight into the effect of pulverization on pore
   structure of coal sample. Moreover, it is of great significance for
   understanding the mechanism of coalbed methane storage and migration and
   is helpful for the selection of the sample size in SAXS experiments.}},

Abstract = {{To meet the performance requirements of ultra-lightweight Phi 500
   mm-reflector optical system in near diffraction limit, the structure of
   the reflector is studied using advanced CAE simulation and modern
   high-performance SiC fabrication technology. Firstly, mirror materials
   were selected by comparing the common materials and manufacturing
   processes of existing mirrors. Then, with regards to the structural
   characteristics of circular symmetrical reflectors, the structure of
   proposed reflector was designed based on integrated optimization of the
   full stiffness method. Finally, the reflector assembly was designed with
   a back-support structure. The simulation results show that the mass of
   proposed primary mirror is less than 5 kg and the surface density is
   less than 20 kg/m(2). The surface errors (RMS value) of the three
   directions of dead weight deformation at 4 degrees C temperature rise
   are less than lambda/50. The first-order resonance frequency of the
   primary mirror assembly is no less than 120 Hz and the stress at the
   weakest point as measured by dynamic response analysis is less than 100
   MPa. The structural optimization of the mirror meets its design
   requirements, with a remarkable lightweight effect and a structure that
   is both stable and reliable.}},

Abstract = {{Decentralized edge computing techniques have been attracted strongly
   attentions in many applications of intelligent Internet of Things
   (IIoT). Among these applications, intelligent edge surveillance (INES)
   methods play a very important role to recognize object feature
   information automatically from surveillance video by virtue of edge
   computing together with image processing and computer vision.
   Traditional centralized surveillance techniques recognize objects at the
   cost of high latency, high cost and also require high occupied storage.
   In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based INES technique for a
   specific IIoT application. First, a depthwise separable convolutional
   strategy is introduced to build a lightweight deep neural network to
   reduce its computational cost. Second, we combine edge computing with
   cloud computing to reduce network traffic. Third, our proposed INES
   method is applied into the practical construction site for the
   validation of a specific IIoT application. The detection speed of the
   proposed INES reaches 16 frames per second in the edge device. After the
   joint computing of edge and cloud, the detection precision can reach as
   high as 89\%. In addition, the operating cost at the edge device is only
   one-tenth of that of the centralized server. Experiment results are
   given to confirm the proposed INES method in terms of both computational
   cost and detection accuracy.}},

Title = {{E-cigarette use among adults in China: findings from repeated

Abstract = {{Background The use of e-cigarettes among adults is increasing globally.
   Since 2018, policies in China have restricted e-cigarette use; however,
   little information is available on the national trend in e-cigarette use
   before regulations were implemented. Therefore, we sought to estimate
   the trend in e-cigarette use in China before policy implementation and
   explored associated factors.
   Methods We assessed two nationally representative cross-sectional
   datasets from the China Chronic Disease and Nutrition Surveillance
   (CCDNS) surveys initiated in 2015 (June, 2015, to May, 2016) and 2018
   (August, 2018, to June, 2019). The surveys were done at 298 national
   disease surveillance points in 31 provinces in mainland China, and used
   a multistage, stratified, cluster-randomised sampling design, recruiting
   community-based Chinese adults aged 18 years and older. Within the
   standard CCDNS survey, face-to-face questionnaire interviews were used
   to collect self report data on e-cigarette use in the preceding 30 days.
   E-cigarette users were those who self-reported e-cigarette use on 1 day
   or more in the past 30 days. Prevalence estimates of past 30-day
   e-cigarette use were weighted to represent the Chinese adult population
   accounting for the complex sampling design. Populations for the years
   2015-16 and 2018-19 were standardised with the 2010 population census to
   gain comparable estimates. Multivariable logistic regression models
   adjusted for age, sex, urban or rural residence, household income,
   occupation, and education level were applied to identify factors
   associated with the likelihood of e-cigarette use among the total
   population, ever smokers (current and former), and never smokers across
   both surveys.
   Findings Our study included 189 306 Chinese adults from the 2015 survey
   (100 405 {[}530\%] women; mean age 436 years {[}SD 146]) and 184 475
   Chinese adults from the 2018 survey (102 373 {[}555\%] women; mean age
   434 years {[}139]). The weighted prevalence of past 30-day e-cigarette
   use among Chinese adults increased from 13\% (95\% CI 11-15\%) in
   2015-16 to 16\% (95\% CI 14-18\%) in 2018-19 (an increase of 03\%
   {[}95\% CI 01-06]; Rao-Scott chi 2 p=00086). Based on weighted
   proportion data, e-cigarette users were predominantly men (974\% {[}95\%
   CI 967-981] in 2015-16 and 970\% {[}954-986] in 2018-19) and current
   conventional smokers (930\% {[}907-952] in 2015-16 and 962\% {[}951-973]
   in 2018-19). Across both surveys, the odds of e-cigarette use were
   significantly associated with obesity (odds ratio 16 {[}95\% CI 13-21];
   p=00007), awareness of smoking hazards (12 {[}10-14]; p=0022), and
   smoking status (in current smokers, 1352 {[}877-2086]; and in former
   smokers, 335 {[}213-527]; p < 00001). Among current smokers, the odds
   were increased with daily cigarette consumption (21 {[}15-28]; p <
   00001), smoking more than 20 cigarettes per day (18 {[}15-23]; p <
   00001), and an attempt to quit smoking (within the past 12 months, 19
   {[}15-24]; and before the past 12 months, 15 {[}13-19]; p < 00001). In
   never smokers, the odds were increased in those aware of the hazards of
   smoking (24 {[}12-47]; p=0011).
   Interpretation E-cigarette use in China remains low but has increased
   substantially between 2015 and 2019. Our study identified increased
   e-cigarette use among subpopulations, and use patterns, that warrant
   further attention from public health policy makers in China.}},

Title = {{Surface-engineered oxidized two-dimensional Sb for efficient visible
   light-driven N-2 fixation}},
Journal = {{NANO ENERGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{78}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Solar N-2 fixation under visible light offers a promising method toward
   sustainable NH3 production at benign conditions. However, it still
   remains a formidable challenge to activate and cleave N=N bonds and
   promote the separation and transport of electrons and holes during
   photocatalysis. To address these issues, the discovery and design of
   high-performance and robust photocatalysts is imperative. Here, we
   report the defect engineering of two-dimensional oxidized Sb nanosheets
   to activate intrinsically inactive Sb for efficient visible light-driven
   N-2 reduction to NH3. Impressively, the Sb nanosheets rich in Sb and
   oxygen vacancies afford a remarkable NH3 formation rate of up to 388.5
   mu g(NH3) h(-1) g(cat)(-1) without cocatalyst in visible light, 8 times
   higher than that for bulk Sb and also significantly outperforming many
   previously reported photocatalysts. The defective Sb nanosheets exhibit
   excellent stability after five successive reaction cycles. Further
   density functional theory calculations reveal a considerably strong
   interaction between N-2 and defects on the surface and edge of Sb
   nanosheets, which facilitates the formation of {*}NNH (N-2 + (H+ + e-)
   -> {*}NNH, where {*} denotes an adsorption site), thus promoting
   photocatalytic N2 reduction. This finding opens a novel avenue to
   enhancing N2 photofixation over inherently inactive surfaces by
   synergistically engineering defect sites.}},

Title = {{Experimental investigation of the characteristics of thermosyphon with
   flat evaporator and micro-pillar arrays}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERMAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{158}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This study experimentally investigated the cascaded start-up performance
   of thermosyphon with a flat evaporating surface combined with different
   sizes of micro-pillars. The thermosyphon was composed of a condenser
   section and an evaporator section. Different sizes of micro-pillar were
   processed on the surface of the evaporator bottom plate to enhance the
   heat transfer. A smooth flat surface was used as the standard reference
   for comparison with the micro-pillar surfaces. Deionized water was used
   as the working fluid to cool the condenser section of the thermosyphon.
   The operating pressure of thermosyphon was measured using a pressure
   sensor. Additionally, the evaporator section wall temperature and the
   temperature and flow rate of the cooling water were measured at nine
   different heat fluxes. The start-up performances of the thermosyphon
   with a smooth evaporator bottom plate (THSE) and thermosyphon with a
   micro-pillar in the evaporator bottom plate (THMPE) were compared. The
   THSE had a longer start-up time and a higher start-up temperature than
   the THMPE. When the heat flux was 68.6 W/cm(2), the start-up time of the
   THMPE with a micro-pillar width of 0.2 mm and a height of 0.8 mm was
   reduced by 57.1\% compared to THSE, and the start-up temperature was
   reduced by 28\%. Thermosyphons with different micro-pillar widths showed
   various start-up performances for different heat fluxes. For a narrow
   micro-pillar width, THMPEs with larger micro-pillar heights had a lower
   start-up temperature and a shorter start-up time. As the micro-pillar
   width increased, the micro-pillar height had a different and more
   complex effect on the start-up performance of the thermosyphon. When the
   micro-pillar heights were 0.2 mm and 0.4 mm, the thermosyphon with wider
   micro-pillars had a longer start-up time with a lower heat flux but a
   shorter start-up time with a higher heat flux. When the micro-pillar
   heights were 0.6 mm and 0.8 mm, varying the micro-pillar width had a
   smaller influence on the start-up performance of the thermosyphon, but
   was dependent on the heat flux.}},

Abstract = {{The current study presents data about the variations in body size and
   color polymorphism of toads from the Bufotes viridis complex inhabiting
   two semi-natural habitats - ``Huhn Bunardzhik{''} Hill (Site 1) and
   ``Mladezhki hulm{''} Hill (Site 2) located in a highly urbanized area of
   Plovdiv City, Bulgaria. The purpose of the analyses was to obtain data
   allowing a better understanding of the adaptive capabilities of this
   anuran complex, allowing it to survive in diverse, incl.
   anthropogenically transformed habitats. The results of our study showed
   that for the parameter snout-vent length (SVL) the main effect of the
   habitat (site) was significant, while the effects of sex and the
   combination sex and site were insignificant. We found significant
   interactions between all three tested variables (site, sex and
   combination sex and site) for the parameter body weight (BW). The
   population from ``Mladezhki hulm{''} Hill was strongly dominated by
   individuals from the two dark-background morphs (C and D), while the
   population from ``Huhn Bunardzhik{''} Hill was dominated by the
   light-colored (A and B morphs) individuals. Our results support the
   hypothesis that color polymorphism in anurans is also influenced by
   environmental factors and habitat characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Quantifying economic and clinical outcomes for interventions could help
   to reduce third-generation cephalosporin resistance and Escherichia coli
   or Klebsiella pneumoniae. We aimed to compare the differences in
   clinical and economic burden between third-generation
   cephalosporin-resistant E. coli (3GCREC) and third-generation
   cephalosporin-susceptible E. coli (3GCSEC) cases, and between
   third-generation cephalosporin-resistant K. pneumoniae (3GCRKP) and
   third-generation cephalosporin-susceptible K. pneumoniae (3GCSKP) cases.
   A retrospective and multicenter study was conducted. We collected data
   from electronic medical records for patients who had clinical samples
   positive for E. coli or K. pneumoniae isolates during 2013 and 2015.
   Propensity score matching (PSM) was conducted to minimize the impact of
   potential confounding variables, including age, sex, insurance, number
   of diagnoses, Charlson comorbidity index, admission to intensive care
   unit, surgery, and comorbidities. We also repeated the PSM including
   length of stay (LOS) before culture. The main indicators included
   economic costs, LOS and hospital mortality. The proportions of 3GCREC
   and 3GCRKP in the sampled hospitals were 44.3\% and 32.5\%,
   respectively. In the two PSM methods, 1804 pairs and 1521 pairs were
   generated, and 1815 pairs and 1617 pairs were obtained, respectively.
   Compared with susceptible cases, those with 3GCREC and 3GCRKP were
   associated with significantly increased total hospital cost and excess
   LOS. Inpatients with 3GCRKP were significantly associated with higher
   hospital mortality compared with 3GCSKP cases, however, there was no
   significant difference between 3GCREC and 3GCSEC cases. Cost reduction
   and outcome improvement could be achieved through a preventative
   approach in terms of both antimicrobial stewardship and preventing the
   transmission of organisms.}},

Abstract = {{To achieve the full passive beamforming gains of intelligent reflecting
   surface (IRS), accurate channel state information (CSI) is indispensable
   but practically challenging to acquire, due to the excessive amount of
   channel parameters to be estimated which increases with the number of
   IRS reflecting elements as well as that of IRS-served users. To tackle
   this challenge, we propose in this paper two efficient channel
   estimation schemes for different channel setups in an IRS-assisted
   multi-user broadband communication system employing the orthogonal
   frequency division multiple access (OFDMA). The first channel estimation
   scheme, which estimates the CSI of all users in parallel simultaneously
   at the access point (AP), is applicable for arbitrary
   frequency-selective fading channels. In contrast, the second channel
   estimation scheme, which exploits a key property that all users share
   the same (common) IRS-AP channel to enhance the training efficiency and
   support more users, is proposed for the typical scenario with
   line-of-sight (LoS) dominant user-IRS channels. For the two proposed
   channel estimation schemes, we further optimize their corresponding
   training designs (including pilot tone allocations for all users and IRS
   time-varying reflection pattern) to minimize the channel estimation
   error. Moreover, we derive and compare the fundamental limits on the
   minimum training overhead and the maximum number of supportable users of
   these two schemes. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the
   proposed channel estimation schemes and training designs, and show their
   significant performance improvement over various benchmark schemes.}},

Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{In the context of infinitesimal theory of elasticity, we derived
   analytical solutions for displacements and stresses in functionally
   graded thick-walled spheres under the application of a uniaxial outer
   tension. While the shear modulus in the graded sphere is allowed to vary
   as a power-law function of radial coordinate, the Poisson's ratio is
   treated as a constant. The semiinverse method of elasticity is first
   employed for proposing correct function forms of the radial and
   longitudinal displacements. The elastostatic Navier's equations of the
   power-law graded sphere lead to a system of second-order differential
   equations of the Euler type. The order is then reduced and the system is
   recast into a first-order differential matrix equation. Analytical
   solutions are subsequently developed by the coupling of differential
   equation and eigenvalue theories. Successfully solving this particular
   problem provides a valid analytical solution scheme for exploring
   elastic fields in graded hollow spheres subjected to nonhydrostatic
   boundary loads. In order to examine the effects of the power-law
   gradation and the radii ratio of the thick-walled sphere on stress
   distributions and stress concentration factors, extensive parametric
   studies are conducted. Analytical solutions of the graded thick-walled
   sphere are further compared with those of the homogeneous case as well
   as with the numerical results due to finite element modelings. The
   obtained results show that the property gradation significantly affects
   stress distributions through the thickness direction of the graded
   thick-walled sphere. When the shear modulus is designed as an increasing
   function of the radial coordinate, the high stress zone conventionally
   occurring near the inner boundary of homogeneous thick-walled spheres
   tends to shift toward to the outer surface vicinity. For a given radii
   ratio, an optimal power-law gradation leading to the lowest stress
   concentration factor can always be identified. The proposed method of
   solution and the obtained results are useful for the design and
   manufacturing of better performing spherical vessels.}},

Title = {{Inhibition of Pyk2 and Src activity improves Cx43 gap junction
   intercellular communication}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR CARDIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{149}},
Pages = {{27-40}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Identification of proteins that interact with Cx43 has been instrumental
   in the understanding of gap junction (GJ) regulation. An in vitro
   phosphorylation screen identified that Protein tyrosine kinase 2 beta
   (Pyk2) phosphorylated purified Cx43CT and this led us to characterize
   the impact of this phosphorylation on Cx43 function. Mass spectrometry
   identified Pyk2 phosphorylates Cx43 residues Y247, Y265, Y267, and Y313.
   Western blot and immunofluorescence staining using HeLa cx43 cells, HEK
   293 T cells, and neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) revealed Pyk2
   can be activated by Src and active Pyk2 interacts with Cx43 at the
   plasma membrane. Overexpression of Pyk2 increases Cx43 phosphorylation
   and knock-down of Pyk2 decreases Cx43 phosphorylation, without affecting
   the level of active Src. In HeLaCx43 cells treated with PMA to activate
   Pyk2, a decrease in Cx43 GJ intercellular communication (GJIC) was
   observed when assayed by dye transfer. Moreover, PMA activation of Pyk2
   could be inhibited by the small molecule PF4618433. This partially
   restored GJIC, and when paired with a Src inhibitor, returned GJIC to
   the no PMA control-level. The ability of Pyk2 and Src inhibitors to
   restore Cx43 function in the presence of PMA was also observed in NRVMs.
   Additionally, an animal model of myocardial infarction induced heart
   failure showed a higher level of active Pyk2 activity and increased
   interaction with Cx43 in ventricular myocytes. Src inhibitors have been
   used to reverse Cx43 remodeling and improve heart function after
   myocardial infarction; however, they alone could not fully restore
   proper Cx43 function. Our data suggest that Pyk2 may need to be
   inhibited, in addition to Src, to further (if not completely) reverse
   Cx43 remodeling and improve intercellular communication.}},

Title = {{Improving the understanding of central Bohai Sea eutrophication based on
   wintertime dissolved inorganic nutrient budgets: Roles of north Yellow
   Sea water intrusion and atmospheric nitrogen deposition}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{267}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The Bohai Sea is a shallow-water, semi-enclosed marginal sea of the
   Northwest Pacific. Since the late 1990s, it has suffered from nutrient
   over-enrichment. To better understand the eutrophication characteristics
   of this important coastal sea, we examined four survey datasets from
   summer (June 2011), late autumn (November 2011), winter (January 2016),
   and early spring (April 2018). Nutrient conditions in the Bohai Sea were
   subject to seasonal and regional variations. Survey-averaged N/P ratios
   in estuarine and nearshore areas were 20-133. In contrast, the central
   Bohai Sea had mean N/P ratios of 16.9 +/- 3.4 in late autumn, 16.1 +/-
   3.0 in winter and 13.5 +/- 5.8 in early spring, which are close to the
   traditional N:P Redfield ratio of 16. In summer, both dissolved
   inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and dissolved inorganic phosphate (DIP) were
   used up in the surface waters of the central Bohai Sea, suggesting that
   the biological consumption of DIN and DIP may also follow the Redfield
   ratio. Wintertime nutrient budgets of the central Bohai Sea water were
   then established based on a mass balance study. Our results suggest that
   the adjacent North Yellow Sea supplied additional DIP to the central
   Bohai Sea via wintertime water intrusion, balancing terrigenous excess
   DIN that was introduced in summer. A water-mixing simulation combining
   these two nutrient sources with atmospheric nitrogen deposition suggests
   that eutrophication in the central Bohai Sea will likely be enhanced by
   the large-scale accumulation of anthropogenic nitrogen in adjacent open
   oceans. Such changes in nutrients may have fundamentally contributed to
   the recent development of algal blooms and seasonal hypoxia in the
   central Bohai Sea. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Comparison of the spaces of call and traffic flows: An empirical study
   of Qianzhong urban region, China}},
Journal = {{CITIES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{107}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{With the rapid growth of transportation and communications technologies,
   intercity relations are reshaping the urban networks. Although previous
   studies have explored urban networks, they were mostly from the
   perspective of the space of places or a single flow, and could not
   sufficiently and accurately capture the reshaping effect of information
   flow on urban networks. This study addresses this gap by employing a
   comparative analysis of cyberspace measured by call flows and physical
   space measured by highway traffic flows. The analysis provides empirical
   evidence for the Qianzhong urban region (QZUR), a less developed area of
   China, concerning the integration and centralization of the urban
   network. And three main conclusions were drawn: (1) Compared to physical
   space, the centralization of an urban network in cyberspace is
   strengthened. The connection between the core and peripheral cities in
   cyberspace becomes strong, and the status of important intermediate
   cities is weakened, forming a disintermediation effect. (2) The
   integration level of urban networks in cyberspace has not been
   significantly improved compared to that in physical space. (3)
   geographical distance has a friction effect on intercity traffic and
   call flows, and the friction effect in physical space is significantly
   greater than that in cyberspace.}},

Volume = {{170}},
Pages = {{15-28}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Parsing very high resolution (VHR) urban scene images into regions with
   semantic meaning, e.g. buildings and cars, is a fundamental task in
   urban scene understanding. However, due to the huge quantity of details
   contained in an image and the large variations of objects in scale and
   appearance, the existing semantic segmentation methods often break one
   object into pieces, or confuse adjacent objects and thus fail to depict
   these objects consistently. To address these issues uniformly, we
   propose a standalone end-to-end edge-aware neural network (EaNet) for
   urban scene semantic segmentation. For semantic consistency preservation
   inside objects, the EaNet model incorporates a large kernel pyramid
   pooling (LKPP) module to capture rich multi-scale context with strong
   continuous feature relations. To effectively separate confusing objects
   with sharp contours, a Dice-based edge-aware loss function (EA loss) is
   devised to guide the EaNet to refine both the pixel- and image-level
   edge information directly from semantic segmentation prediction. In the
   proposed EaNet model, the LKPP and the EA loss couple to enable
   comprehensive feature learning across an entire semantic object.
   Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that our
   method can be readily generalized to multi-scale ground/aerial urban
   scene images, achieving 81.7\% in mIoU on Cityscapes Test set and 90.8\%
   in the mean F1-score on the ISPRS Vaihingen 2D Test set. Code is
   available at: http://github.com/geovsion/EaNet.}},

Journal = {{MICROORGANISMS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Vibriosis, caused by Vibrio strains, is an important bacterial disease
   and capable of causing significant high mortality in aquatic animals.
   Essential oils (EOs) have been considered as an alternative approach for
   the treatment of aquatic bacterial diseases. In this study, we evaluated
   the antibacterial activity of essential oils (n = 22) or essential oil
   components (EOCs, n = 12) against Vibrio strains belonging to the
   harveyi clade. It was verified by three different approaches, e.g., (i)
   a bacterial growth assay, comparing Vibrio growth with or without EO(C)s
   at various concentrations; (ii) a vapor-phase-mediated susceptibility
   assay, comparing the effect of EO(C)s on bacterial growth through the
   vapor phase; and (iii) a quorum sensing-inhibitory assay, based on
   specific inhibition of quorum sensing-regulated bioluminescence. The
   results showed that, in the bacterial growth assay, EOs of Melaleuca
   alternifolia and Litsea citrata at 0.0001\%, Eucalyptus citriodora at
   0.01\% can inhibit the growth of Vibrio campbellii BB120. These EOs can
   also prevent the growth of V. parahaemolyticus strains but need to be
   present at a higher concentration (0.1\%). Moreover, in the
   vapor-phase-mediated susceptibility assay, EOs of M. alternifolia, L.
   citrata and E. citriodora can inhibit the growth of V. campbellii BB120
   through their vapor phase. However, V. parahaemolyticus strains
   (CAIM170, LMG2850 and MO904) cannot be inhibited by these EOs.
   Additionally, in the quorum sensing-inhibitory assay, EOs of Mentha
   pulegium, Cuminum cyminum, Zingiber officinalis, and E. citriodora, all
   at 0.001\%, have quorum sensing-inhibitory activity in V. campbellii
   BB120. Taken together, our study provides substantial evidence that
   usage of the major components, individually or in combination, of the
   tested commercial EOs (extracted from M. alternifolia, L. citrata, and
   E. citriodora) could be a promising approach to control V. campbellii
   BB120.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{84}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The great potential of supercritical CO2 fracturing technique in the
   stimulation of unconventional reservoirs requires further insight into
   the mechanism of proppant transport in the fracture. In this paper, we
   adopted the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) coupled discrete element
   method (DEM) scheme to study the proppant transport in supercritical CO2
   fluid, and verified this method via previous experiment data. Based on
   the visual analysis at the particle-level, transport mechanisms of
   proppant in the fracture were revealed. The difference in the proppant
   transport capacity between supercritical CO2 and commonly used
   fracturing fluids were demonstrated, and effects of slurry injection
   velocity, proppant concentration, injection temperature, and proppant
   diameter were discussed. Results indicate that the transport and
   placement process of the proppant can be divided into three stages,
   i.e., flat laying stage, proppant dune development stage, and proppant
   bank development stage. The supercritical CO2 slurry is characterized by
   obvious stratified flow in the fracture: the static bed at the bottom,
   the fluidization layer above it, and the pure fluid flow region at the
   top. Viscous drag transport, lifting transport, and fluidization
   transport are three proppant transport mechanisms for supercritical CO2
   slurry flow, among which the fluidization transport plays a more
   dominant role. This work is expected to provide an in-depth
   understanding of the transport mechanism of supercritical CO2 slurry in
   a vertical planar fracture.}},

Title = {{The optimal configuration planning of energy hubs in urban integrated
   energy system using a two-layered optimization method}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS}},

Abstract = {{In the modern metropolitan regions, the coupling among distribution
   networks (DNs), gas networks (GNs), and transportation networks (TNs) is
   increasingly intensified, which gives rise to the urgent demand for
   efficient modeling and solving methods. In this context, a mathematical
   model for the configuration planning of integrated energy systems is
   proposed in this paper. With the aim of minimizing total planning costs,
   the model jointly considers the investment and operation strategies for
   distribution lines, distributed wind power generators (DWGs), combined
   heat and power units (CHPs), power to gas units (P2Gs), gas furnaces
   (GFs), fast charging facilities (FCFs) and slow charging facilities
   (SCFs). Since the proposed model comes down to a non convex and
   nonlinear optimization problem, a two-layer algorithm is designed to
   solve it. In the outer layer, a genetic algorithm (GA) is performed to
   obtain a set of individuals representing the investment decisions on
   distribution lines, DWGs, and FCFs, which will be delivered to the inner
   layer model. With fixed decision variables, the inner model optimizes
   the operating costs, charging profit coefficients, and strategies for
   DWGs and energy converters in a coordinated manner. A real urban area in
   China is employed in the numerical experiment, which corroborates the
   effectiveness of the proposed model and solution algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Contaminants in coastal wastewater are prone to induce red tide in sea
   water and cannot be removed with traditional biological and ecological
   treatment methods due to salt stress. In this study, constructed
   wetlands (CWs) were used to remove contaminants from coastal wastewater
   and the optimal conditions of CWs including C/N ratio and initial
   contaminant concentration in influents were determined. CW-0.5
   (constructed wetlands with a salinity of 0.5 parts per thousand) was the
   optimal CW treatment system and realized higher removal efficiencies
   (75.29\% of TN and 76.33\% of COD) at 150 mg L-1 COD and 30 mg L-1 in
   influents after 3 day HRT. After adding 20 mg L-1 ferrous ions, the COD
   and TN removal efficiencies were respectively increased by 8.67\% and
   3.71\%. According to the high-throughput sequencing results,
   Thioalkalivibrio was identified to promote denitrification. Under salt
   stress conditions, ferrous ions optimized the microbial community
   structure and promoted the enrichment of specific bacteria for
   wastewater treatments. The optimal CW in this study is a promising
   process for the efficient nitrogen removal from coastal wastewater.}},

Title = {{Kinematic analysis of the three-dimensional stability for tunnel faces
   by pseudodynamic approach}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS AND GEOTECHNICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{128}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Seismic waves have significant effects on the stability of geotechnical
   engineering projects. However, only a small number of studies have
   focused on the seismic stability of tunnel faces. Using the kinematic
   approach of limit analysis, this paper conducts a seismic analysis to
   evaluate the three-dimensional stability of the tunnel face. A three
   dimensional rotational mechanism is introduced to describe the active
   collapse of a tunnel face. To overcome the shortcomings of the
   conventional pseudostatic method, the pseudodynamic method, which can
   consider the variation in acceleration with time and space, is used to
   characterize earthquake acceleration. The collapse body is horizontally
   sliced into many layers considering the acceleration changing with
   space, and the work rate is calculated along the horizontal plane. Based
   on the kinematic analysis method, the explicit equation to calculate the
   required supporting pressure on the tunnel face is derived. The results
   can be obtained using the optimization algorithm. The validity of the
   proposed method is proven in comparison to that of existing solutions.
   Parameter analysis is further performed to reveal the effects of
   specific parameters on the retaining force.}},

Abstract = {{Structures and functionality of two groups of high-amylose maize hybrids
   starches (HAMHSs) with the same maternal parent but different paternal

   had the same maternal parents within the groups, respectively. Paternal
   parent affected the molecular size of amylopectin components of HAMHS as
   deduced by gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis of native
   samples. GPC analysis of debranched samples and further amylose fitting
   analysis showed the paternal parent effect on the average chain lengths
   of amylose and long amylopectin (DP > 36). WAXS and SAXS data showed
   paternal parent only affected the thickness of crystalline lamellae and
   the amorphous lamellae, but had no effect on polymorph type,
   crystallinity, lamellar ordering, and long periodic distance of HAMHS.
   In addition, water solubility and contents of rapidly digestible starch,
   slowly digestible starch, and resistant starch were all affected by the
   paternal parent. In summary, we report some significant differences of
   HAMHS with the same maternal parent but different paternal parent.}},

Abstract = {{3Ultraviolet-C (UV-C) irradiation is known for prolonging the shelf life
   of many fruit by regulating different pathways. To better understand the
   roles of UV-C treatment in regulating the metabolic pathways in peach
   fruit during cold storage, transcriptomics and proteomics approaches
   were applied to investigate changes in peaches treated with UV-C (1.5 kJ
   m(-2)). The results showed that most differentially expressed genes
   (DEGs) and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were largely matched
   to carbohydrates and secondary metabolites. Further analysis found that
   peaches treated with UV-C exhibited higher sucrose, citric acid, malic
   acid, phenols, flavonoids and anthocyanins compared with untreated
   peaches. Proteomics and transcriptomics together indicated that changes
   of sugars and acids were associated with the expressions of invertase,
   sucrose synthase, fructokinase, malate dehydmgenase and citrate
   synthase. UV-C irradiation promoted the synthesis of phenols, flavonoids
   and anthocyanins by up-regulating expressions of phenylalanine
   ammonia-lyase, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase, chalcone synthase,
   dihydroflavonol 4-reductase and UDP-glucose:flavonoid
   glucosyltransferase. In summary, this research explained the general
   molecular mechanism of the changes of sugars, acids and phenols in
   peaches in response to UV-C.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we demonstrate a method to generate a low-chirp
   ultra-wideband pulse (UWB) signal based on a silicon single-drive
   push-pull segmented Mach-Zehnder modulator (SMZM). The concept is
   analyzed theoretically and demonstrated experimentally. We get positive
   monocycle pulses with different relative time delays between the two
   driving signals. The center frequency and fractional bandwidth of the
   generated positive monocycle pulse is 5.97 GHz and 161\% with a relative
   time delay of 56 ps. By changing the operating point of the SMZM, we can
   get negative monocycle pulses. We modulate the UWB signals with on-off
   keying and pulse position formats by properly coding the driving signal.
   As far as we know, this is the first time to realize low-chirp UWB
   signals using only one silicon modulator. The successful generation of
   UWB signals poses a significant step in realizing a compact low-cost and
   low-chirp UWB generator on the silicon photonics platform.}},

Abstract = {{Generation of 3-sulfonated 2H-pyrrol-2-ones through a three-component
   reaction of allenoic amides, sulfur dioxide, and aryldiazonium
   tetrafluoroborates under metal-free conditions is achieved. This
   transformation proceeds under mild conditions without the addition of
   catalysts or additives, giving rise to 3-sulfonated 2H-pyrrol-2-ones in
   moderate to good yields. Good functional group compatibility is
   observed. A plausible mechanism is proposed, which is initiated by aryl
   radicals formed in situ from aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborates and DABCO
   center dot(SO2)(2). Additionally, excellent chemoselectivity and
   regioselectivity are presented in this transformation. (C) 2020 Chinese

Abstract = {{Purpose: To compare retinal vascular parameters acquired by handheld
   swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography (SS-OCTA) between
   nonsedated preterm and full-term infants.
   Methods: Preterm and full-term infants at the University of Washington
   Medical Center were enrolled. Retinal angiograms (nominal size similar
   to 7 x 7 mm(2)) were obtained at each routine retinopathy of prematurity
   (ROP) screening session for preterms and once during the first 72 hours
   of life for full-terms. Macular vessel area density and nonperfusion
   area were evaluated on the binarized vasculature map in both small (1.5
   x 1.5 mm) and large (3 x 3 mm) quadrants. Average vessel diameter and
   tortuosity values were obtained from each large vessel branch (length
   >200 mu m). All vascular analyses used previously published algorithms.
   Results: Handheld SS-OCTA captured 31 of 55 (56\%) high-quality volumes
   on 8 awake preterm infants (gestational age 28 +/- 4 weeks, birth weight
   891 +/- 314 g, postmenstrual age at first imaging session 37 +/- 2
   weeks) and 48 of 54 (89\%) volumes on 12 awake full-term infants
   (gestational age 39 +/- 1 weeks, birth weight 3405 +/- 329 g).
   Signal-to-noise ratio was 5.08 +/- 1.52 dB in preterm and 4.90 +/- 1.12
   dB in full-term infants. Preterm infants had higher mean large vessel
   tortuosity compared to full-term infants (P = 0.004). The large nasal
   quadrant vessel area density of infants with stage 3 and/or pre-plus or
   worse ROP was higher than other preterm infants (P = 0.007).
   Conclusions: Although inadequate image quality limited usable imaging
   sessions, handheld SS-OCTA achieved adequate signal-to-noise ratio in
   nonsedated infants for quantitative retinal vascular parameter analysis.
   Translational Relevance: Large- and small-vessel parameters were
   associated with prematurity and ROP severity, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common digestive tumor
   with great heterogeneity and different overall survival (OS) time,
   causing stern problems for selecting optimal treatment. Here we aim to
   establish a nomogram to predict the OS in HCC

   was searched for the target information in our study. Lasso regression,
   univariate and multivariate cox analysis were applied during the
   analysis process. And a nomogram integrating model scoring and clinical
   characteristic was drawn.ResultsSix mRNAs were screened out by Lasso
   regression to make a model for predicting the OS of HCC patients. And
   this model was proved to be an independent prognostic model predicting
   OS in HCC patients. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of this model was
   0.803. TCGA database validated the significant value of this 6-mRNA
   model. Eventually a nomogram including 6-mRNA risk score, gender, age,
   tumor stage and prior malignancy was set up to predict the OS in HCC
   patients.ConclusionsWe established an independent prognostic model of
   predicting OS for 1-3years in HCC patients, which is available to all
   populations. And we developed a nomogram on the basis of this model,
   which could be of great help to precisely individual treatment measures.}},

Abstract = {{In order to develop a water-saving irrigation system for spring wheat,
   field experiments were conducted on the deficit irrigation of spring
   wheat in Hetao Irrigation District, Inner Mongolia. Through measurement
   of soil moisture content, the spring wheat growth and yield index, the
   influences of deficit irrigation on soil moisture distribution and
   spring wheat growth were studied. Results showed that, in the soil
   layers 0-100 cm below the ground, the soil moisture content under full
   irrigation at 100\% ETc (ETc denotes actual water demanded by crops) and
   that under deficit irrigation at 80\% ETc increased with the increase of
   soil layer depth; specifically, soil moisture under deficit irrigation
   at 60\% ETc was mainly distributed in the subsurface layer (20-40 cm)
   and the middle layer (40-60 cm). The spring wheat yield was not greatly
   influenced by the deficit irrigation at 80\% ETc, showing a decrease of
   merely 5-13\% compared with that under full irrigation, while deficit
   irrigation at 60\% ETc had greater impact on the growth and yield of
   spring wheat, cutting the yield by 10-37\% in comparison with that under
   full irrigation. In the study area, the deficit irrigation treatment at
   80\% ETc was adopted, wherein the irrigation norm in the growth period
   was 288 mm. This irrigation system had little adverse impact on spring
   wheat growth and yield, and therefore, water-saving irrigation could be
   realized.}},

   prediction results is eliminated with the empirical mode decomposition.
   To further improve the accuracy and stability of the prediction method,
   the parameters of long short-term memory neural networks are determined
   with a sine cosine algorithm. The performances of the long short-term
   memory method in terms of root mean square error, mean absolute error,
   and coefficient of determination in January and August are analysed,
   respectively. Compared with other prediction schemes, the long

Abstract = {{We have performed a multiwavelength study of supernova remnant (SNR)
   G57.2+0.8 and its environment. The SNR hosts the magnetar SGR 1935+2154,
   which emitted an extremely bright millisecond-duration radio burst on
   2020 April 28. We used the (CO)-C-12 and (CO)-C-13 J = 1-0 data from the
   Milky Way Image Scroll Painting CO line survey to search for molecular
   gas associated with G57.2+0.8, in order to constrain the physical
   parameters (e.g., the distance) of the SNR and its magnetar. We report
   that SNR G57.2+0.8 is likely impacting the molecular clouds (MCs) at the
   local standard of rest (LSR) velocity V-LSR similar to 30 km s(-1) and
   excites a weak 1720 MHz OH maser with a peak flux density of 47 mJy
   beam(-1). The chance coincidence of a random OH spot falling in the SNR
   is <= 12\%, and the OH-CO correspondence chance is 7\% at the maser
   spot. This combines to give <1\% false probability of the OH maser,
   suggesting a real maser detection. The LSR velocity of the MCs places
   the SNR and magnetar at a kinematic distance of 6.6 0.7 kpc. The
   nondetection of thermal X-ray emission from the SNR and the relatively
   dense environment suggests G57.2+0.8 be an evolved SNR with an age t
   greater than or similar to 1.6 x 10(4)(d/6.6 kpc) yr. The explosion
   energy of G57.2+0.8 is lower than 2 x 10(51)(n(0)/10 cm(-3))(1.16)(d/6.6
   kpc)(3.16) erg, which is not very energetic even assuming a high ambient
   density n(0) = 10 cm(-3). This reinforces the opinion that magnetars do
   not necessarily result from very energetic supernova explosions.}},

Title = {{The PM removal process of wetland plant leaves with different rainfall
   intensities and duration}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{275}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Today, particulate-matter (PM) pollution has become one of the most
   severe air-pollution problems. As the most commonly used method in daily
   life, phytoremediation can use plant organs (such as leaves) as
   biological filters for pollutants to repair the atmosphere. At the same
   time, rainfall can remove PM from plant-leaf surfaces and enable them to
   adsorb PM again. By simulating natural rainfall, the rainfall
   characteristics are quantified as rainfall intensity and rainfall
   duration, and we use the washout-weighing method to obtain the amount of
   PM removed from the leaf surface. Then, use a scanner to scan the leaves
   after rain to get their images, and use Image J software to process the
   images to obtain leaf area. Finally, the amount of PM removed by rain
   per unit leaf area can be calculated. It will be used to explore the
   impact of different rainfall intensity and duration on the removal of PM
   from the leaf surface of wetland plants. The results showed that under
   three rainfall intensities used in this experiment, the removal of PM
   from plant-leaf surfaces all increased with an increase in rainfall
   duration. When the particle size is 10-100-mu m, and the rainfall
   intensity is 30 mm/h, the removal amount of plant particles tested in
   this experiment is the largest. With increased rainfall duration, the
   removal of PM from plant-leaf surfaces increased sharply at first, then
   slowly, and finally tended to be stable. The removal efficiency of PM on
   the blade surface is most apparent at the early stage of rainfall, and
   then gradually weakens. Among the four wetland plants tested in this
   experiment, in the range of 10-100-mu m, the number of PM on the leaf
   surface of Scirpus validus is the largest, and the optimum rainfall
   intensity is 30 mm/h; in the range of 2.5-10-mu m, the number of PM on
   the leaf surface of Typha orientalis is the largest, and the optimal
   rainfall intensity is 30 mm/h; in the range of 0.45-2.5-mu m, the number
   of PM on the leaf surface of Iris wilsonii is the largest, and the
   optimal rainfall intensity is 15 mm/h. Wetland species with high
   particle accumulation capacity can provide references for vegetation
   restoration of degraded wetland plants and plant cultivation in
   constructed wetlands. At the same time, the best rainfall intensity and
   duration for removing particulate matter on the surface of plant leaves
   were obtained through experiments, which provided a reference for the
   design of automatic plant irrigation systems and dust removers in
   different scenarios.}},

Title = {{Impact of rural residential coal combustion on air pollution in
   Shandong, China}},
Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{260}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Rural residential coal combustion (RRCC) for household heating is a
   potentially important source of air pollution. However, little research
   has been done on the environmental impacts of RRCC. This study therefore
   investigated the impacts of RRCC on air pollution based on detailed
   household heating data obtained from intensive face-to-face interviews
   in Shandong province, China. The total contributions and specific
   contributions of coal, stoves, and coal-stove combinations to air
   pollution were simulated using the WRF-CAMx-PSAT model. The RRCC for
   heating had a considerable impact on air pollution, contributing 36.1,
   9.1, and 16.1\% of atmospheric SO2, NOx, and PM2.5 in winter,
   respectively. Different coal -stove combinations had different impacts
   on air pollution and mitigation efficiencies. The combination of
   bituminous coal and advanced coal stoves was the dominant contributor to
   air pollution, comprising 60.3-68.8\% of the total RRCC contribution to
   different air pollutants. Sensitivity analyses indicated that bituminous
   coal burnt in a traditional stove had the highest mitigation efficiency
   (0.67 mu g . m(-3)/ 1 0 kt) for atmospheric PM2.5 pollution, 4.1 times
   higher than that of anthracite briquette coal burnt in advanced coal
   stoves. Moreover, although RRCC is a near-surface emission source, it
   contributed considerably to regional pollution. Non-local RRCC emissions
   accounted for 21.8-74.6,15.5-72.3, and 35.3-79.9\% of the total
   contribution to SO2, NOx, and PM2.5 in different cities, respectively.
   The findings of this study improve understanding on the environmental
   impacts of rural emissions and can provide scientific support for the
   formulation of effective air pollution mitigation strategies. (C) 2020

Title = {{Urban water security assessment in the context of sustainability and
   urban water management transitions: An empirical study in Shanghai}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{275}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Despite the relevance of urban water security in protecting water
   resources and supporting sustainable urban development, the literature
   seldom addresses sustainability and the features of urban water
   management practices in the assessment. Hence, based on the four
   sustainability dimensions (environment, society, economy and
   institution) and the cumulative objectives of urban water management
   transitions (from facilitating water supply, sewage, drainage, pollution
   treatment, water utilization, to resilience), this study analyzed the
   water security condition in Shanghai during 2011-2017 and examined the
   progress of the sequence of the Three-Year Action Plan on Environmental
   Protection and Construction implemented in Shanghai. Besides, the
   Criteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) method
   was performed to determine indicator weights without integration of
   value choices. The results showed that the water security condition in
   Shanghai has gently variated during 2011-2013 and distinctly improved
   from 2013 (the single score as 0.270) to 2017 (the single score as
   0.859). The condition of abrupt environmental events, water use, river
   quality, and pollution discharge has significantly fluctuated during the
   investigated period. Policy analysis pointed out that river quality
   improvement, pollutant control, and wastewater treatment advancement
   have been the focus throughout the urban water policy measures in
   Shanghai. However, unstable water resource availability leads to a risk
   of water security deterioration in Shanghai in the long term and sewage
   infrastructure planning shall be refined to facilitate sufficient sewage
   collection. Furthermore, Shanghai shall notice incorporating water use
   and disaster management into water policy planning to better support
   water utilization efficiency and urban resilience. This study
   contributes to the framework development and comparative assessment
   practices in urban water security studies. The application of the
   suggested framework and assessment approach can allow policymakers to
   analyze the improvement needs of urban water security and favor policy
   design. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Vasomotor menopausal symptoms and risk of cardiovascular disease: a
   pooled analysis of six prospective studies}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Menopausal vasomotor symptoms (ie, hot flashes and night
   sweats) have been associated with unfavorable risk factors and surrogate
   markers of cardiovascular disease, but their association with clinical
   cardiovascular disease events is unclear.
   OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations between different components of
   vasomotor symptoms, timing of vasomotor symptoms, and risk of
   cardiovascular disease.
   STUDY DESIGN: We harmonized and pooled individual-level data from 23,365
   women in 6 prospective studies that contributed to the International
   Collaboration for a Life Course Approach to Women's Reproductive Health
   and Chronic Disease Events consortium. Women who experienced
   cardiovascular disease events before baseline were excluded. The
   associations between frequency (never, rarely, sometimes, and often),
   severity (never, mild, moderate, and severe), and timing (before or
   after age of menopause; ie, early or late onset) of vasomotor symptoms
   and incident cardiovascular disease were analyzed. Cox proportional
   hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95\% confidence
   intervals.
   RESULTS: In the adjusted model, no evidence of association was found
   between the frequency of hot flashes and incident cardiovascular
   disease, whereas women who reported night sweats ``sometimes{''} (hazard
   ratio, 1.22; 95\% confidence interval, 1.02-1.45) or ``often{''} (hazard
   ratio, 1.29; 95\% confidence interval, 1.05-1.58) had higher risk for
   cardiovascular disease. Increased severity of either hot flashes or
   night sweats was associated with higher risk of cardiovascular disease.
   The hazards ratios of cardiovascular disease in women with severe hot
   flashes, night sweats, and any vasomotor symptoms were 1.83 (95\%
   confidence interval, 1.22-2.73), 1.59 (95\% confidence interval,
   1.07-2.37), and 2.11 (95\% confidence interval, 1.62-2.76),
   respectively. Women who reported severity of both hot flashes and night
   sweats had a higher risk for cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio, 1.55;
   95\% confidence interval, 1.24-1.94) than those with hot flashes alone
   (hazard ratio, 1.33; 95\% confidence interval, 0.94-1.88) and night
   sweats alone (hazard ratio, 1.32; 95\% confidence interval, 0.84-2.07).
   Women with either early-onset (hazard ratio, 1.38; 95\% confidence
   interval, 1.10-1.75) or late-onset (hazard ratio, 1.69; 95\% confidence
   interval, 1.32-2.16) vasomotor symptoms had an increased risk for
   incident cardiovascular disease compared with women who did not
   experience vasomotor symptoms.
   CONCLUSION: Severity rather than frequency of vasomotor symptoms (hot
   flashes and night sweats) was associated with increased risk of
   cardiovascular disease. Vasomotor symptoms with onset before or after
   menopause were also associated with increased risk of cardiovascular
   disease.}},

Abstract = {{Superhydrophobic surfaces are fragile and are prone to failure in harsh
   outdoor environments. The preparation of robust superhydrophobic
   surfaces with stable performance and excellent properties can extend
   their application. In this paper, we report a simple and cost-effective
   method to prepare a superhydrophobic block using superhydrophobic zinc
   oxide powder and die pressing. The prepared sample has a contact angle
   of 163 degrees and a sliding angle of 7 degrees. Tests show that the
   superhydrophobic block can resist the impact of water flow, maintain its
   superhydrophobicity after friction or knife scraping, and quickly repair
   the destroyed surface by sandpaper abrasion. The sample exhibited
   excellent self-cleaning effect, robust mechanical property, and rapid
   repairability. This preparation method is also environmental-friendly
   and easy to operate. It will have a wide application prospect in many
   important fields.}},

Abstract = {{Osteochondral defects affect both of cartilage and subchondral areas,
   thus it poses a significant challenge to simultaneously regenerate two
   parts in orthopedics. Tissue engineering strategy is currently regarded
   as the most promising way to repair osteochondral defects. This study
   focuses on developing a multilayered scaffold with enhanced interface
   bonding through 3D printing. One-shot printing process enables control
   over material composition, pore structure, and size in each region of
   the scaffold, while realizes seamlessly integrated construct as well.
   The scaffold was designed to be triphasic: a porous bone layer composed
   of alginate sodium (SA) and mesoporous bioactive glasses (MBG), an
   intermediate dense layer also composed of SA and MBG and a cartilaginous
   layer composed of SA. The mechanical strength including the interface
   adhesion strength between layers were characterized. The results
   indicated that SA crosslinking after 3D printing anchored different
   materials together and integrated all regions. Additional scaffold
   soaking in simulated body fluid (SBF) and cell culture medium induced
   apatite deposition and had weakened the compressive and tensile
   strengths, while no layer dislocation or delamination occurred.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid development of world trade exchange, transnational and
   cross regional e-commerce enterprises have become the heat conductor of
   trade exchanges among people, organizations and related enterprises of
   all countries, as well as the important content of high-quality economic
   development of all countries. Multi-national and transregional
   e-commerce enterprises have the characteristics of simple circulation
   structure, simplified transaction cost, high efficiency and rapid
   evolution in economic and trade activities. However, the traditional
   transnational and transregional e-commerce enterprises have the
   disadvantages of slow development and low efficiency in the supply
   chain. At the same time, there are still many uncertain factors in the
   corresponding decision sequence. In this paper, the risks faced by
   cross-border e-commerce supply chain will be comprehensively analyzed
   and studied. At the same time, the decision-making problem of
   cross-border e-commerce supply chain sequence will be studied
   innovatively from two aspects of random uncertainty and fuzzy
   uncertainty, and a double-layer random expectation model will be
   established to form a fractal statistical model of supply chain
   sequence. In this paper, two kinds of sequential strategies are
   discussed in detail, and a double-layer fuzzy equivalent model is
   established. Finally, the model is solved by optimization software. The
   experimental results show that the fractal fractional optimization model
   proposed in this paper has advantages for the supply chain optimization
   of multi-national and cross regional e-commerce enterprises.}},

Abstract = {{The population of the Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) in the
   Russian Far East is currently being restored; young individuals are
   being spread within the historical range, including territory in China.
   Here, the assessment of the suitability for the territories that exist
   in Northeastern China as the Amur tiger habitat and its food supply-prey
   base (three species of ungulates, namely wild boar, red deer and roe
   deer) are shown. A specially protected area-the Taipingou Natural
   Reserve, located on the border of the People's Republic of China and
   Russia-was examined. The modelling of habitat suitability for ungulates
   was performed on the basis of Earth remote sensing data by using two
   different approaches: expert geo-information assessment of the territory
   and discriminant analysis modelling. Based on discriminant analysis, the
   modelling of the suitability of ungulate habitats (without the
   variability of plant communities) showed a small difference between the
   model results for wild boar and roe deer. Nevertheless, the connection
   with the morphometric characteristics of the relief was more important
   for the wild boar than the roe deer. Furthermore, the variability of
   vegetation types was more important for the roe deer. The analysis of
   the biotopes showed that wild boars prefer the central and northern
   parts of Taipingou National Reserve, while the main roe deer
   distribution is in the western part of the Reserve; red deer are more
   common in the southern part of the Reserve.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technology is a simple and flexible
   method used to prepare high-quality crystalline materials. Traditional
   CVD technology, based on pre-deposited thin catalyst metal, usually
   produces nanostructures instead of continuous films. In this work, a
   continuous GaN film on a monolayer boron nitride (h-BN) insertion layer
   is demonstrated using CVD technology. The experimental results and
   theoretical calculations indicate that abundant GaN nanocrystallites are
   firstly formed at the edges or grain boundaries of the monolayer h-BN by
   quasi-van der Waals epitaxy. Then, the vapor-solid mechanism will
   control further growth of the GaN nanocrystallites, causing them to
   merge into a continuous GaN film. Meanwhile, the CVD-grown GaN
   ultraviolet detector exhibits a relatively high responsivity with a
   value of 0.57 A W-1 at 2 V. In this paper, a simple low-cost CVD method
   is proposed for preparing continuous films on two-dimensional materials

Abstract = {{In this article, a robust-oriented optimization design method is
   proposed for the permanent magnet (PM) motors. The key of the method is
   to introduce the concept of parameter fluctuation into motor design
   process, which aims at solving the uncertainties during motor
   manufacturing process. The optimization design process is purposely
   divided into two layers. In the Layer I, except for the motor
   performance objectives, the influence of parameters fluctuation on motor
   performances is also served as the design objectives to obtain the
   deterministic motor structure. In the Layer II, the allowable
   manufacture errors caused by the parameter fluctuation and the
   manufacturing qualification rate of the motor with the errors are
   calculated and optimized simultaneously. Then, an interior PM (IPM)
   motor is chosen as a design example during robust optimization process.
   For verifying the effectiveness of the optimization design, the
   performances are evaluated in detail and the prototype motor is built.
   Finally, both theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the
   effectiveness of design method and the rationality of PM motor.}},

Abstract = {{A new cubic superhard large-cell carbon allotrope with 200 carbon atoms
   per unit cell (named c-C-200) is theoretically predicted by the unbiased
   swarm structure searching techniques combined with the first-principles
   calculations. The phonon and elastic constants calculations show that
   c-C-200 is dynamically and mechanically stable. The calculated hardness
   of c-C-200 is 47 GPa, which means that c-C-200 is a potential superhard
   material. The calculated electronic band structure of c-C-200 shows that
   it is a quasi-direct band gap semiconductor with a gap of 2.781 eV.}},

   floodplains of the lower reaches of Yangtze River}},
Journal = {{OCEAN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{217}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Serious seismic damage is expected owing to the occurrence of lateral
   displacement following soil liquefaction after a strong earthquake.
   Currently, there is a need for increased research on the lateral
   deformation occurring inside a liquefied foundation and its spatial
   distribution characteristics. Considering the initial geostatic stress
   of a slightly sloping site, a finite-element model that reflects the
   liquefaction-induced slippage of the liquefiable site with a slightly
   inclined ground was designed. According to the results, the steeper the
   ground slope is, the weaker the soil liquefaction in the slope body will
   be. As the ground inclination and the intensity of input ground motion
   vary, the lateral slippage of the liquefiable soil layer transforms from
   the liquefaction-induced slipping along a single sliding surface to that
   along multiple sliding surfaces. The dominant lateral displacement of
   liquefiable soil layers in the slope body changes as well, from
   liquefaction-induced slippage of soil to largely large single-direction
   accumulated shear deformation of softening soil, as a result of the
   drastically reduced intensity of the liquefiable soil. In addition, a
   similar linear relationship is found among the maximum lateral
   displacement, the ground settlement near the slope crest, and the ground
   uplift near the slope foot.}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to investigate alterations in brain function among
   different subtypes of auditory hallucinations (AH) in drug-naive first
   episode schizophrenia patients. We recruited 20 patients with drug-naive
   first episode schizophrenia who had constant commanding and commenting
   auditory verbal hallucinations (CCCAVH), 15 drug-naive first episode
   schizophrenia patients who had nonverbal auditory hallucinations (NVAH),
   and 20 healthy controls to participate in this study. We used global
   functional connectivity density (gFCD) and one-way analysis of
   covariance to characterize differences in brain function between the two
   patient groups. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. As
   compared to controls, schizophrenia patients with CCCAVH demonstrated
   increased gFCD in the right Broca's area, bilateral superior temporal
   gyri, hippocampus, bilateral insula, and anterior cingulate gyri, and
   decreased gFCD in the left temporoparietal junction (family-wise error
   {[}FEW] correct, P < 0.05). Schizophrenia patients with NVAH
   demonstrated increased gFCD in the bilateral superior temporal gyri and
   most of the components of the default mode network (DMN), and decreased
   gFCD in components of the executive control network (FWE correct, P <
   0.05). We found that schizophrenia patients with CCCAVH and NVAH have
   distinct functional brain patterns. The features observed in patients
   with CCCAVH are consistent with the ``inner speech{''} hypothesis of AH.
   Features of patients with NVAH suggest hyperactivity of the superior
   temporal gyrus and DMN, and hypoactivity of the prefrontal lobe.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, there have been two competing perspectives on the links of
   rapid sea ice retreat over the Barents-Kara Seas (BKS) and in
   midlatitude severe cold winters over Eurasia. By using the daily ECMWF
   reanalysis (ERA)-Interim dataset during 1979-2016, we reconcile two
   contrasting viewpoints, namely, if an upward turbulent heat flux appears
   and maintains several days after the rapid sea ice loss over the BKS in
   winter, a dipole structure which consists of a primary positive center
   of action around the Barents Sea with the other opposite-sign center of
   action over Eurasian continent is easily amplified, and consequently a
   cold anomaly over Eurasia will occur, but not vice versa. Our work casts
   light on the links between the Arctic sea ice loss and Eurasian cold
   winter anomalies by revealing the different responses of the surface
   turbulent heat flux (STHF) after rapid sea ice retreat on a daily basis.}},

Abstract = {{Pluralism is deployed to govern migration across the Global North and
   Global South in contradictory ways. Fearing the arrival of migrants on
   its own shores - a threat to its biopolitical constitution - Europe
   deploys discourses of pluralism in the Global South to encourage
   migrants en route to Europe to sedentarize in ``transit{''} countries
   like Sudan. Neoliberal development projects propagate the virtues of
   pluralism to host communities in Sudan, who are exhorted to view
   migrants as potential economic assets. Yet, in the context of Europe
   those same migrants continue to be seen as an economic and racial
   threat. While a lack of skills and entrepreneurialism are framed as the
   ``root cause{''} of migration to Europe, migrants are paradoxically
   presented as trainable and therefore economically productive in the
   Global South. This article offers a critical examination of
   consolidating migration management practices in Sudan, their imbrication
   with development projects, and the racial anxieties they evoke in both
   Europe and in ``transit{''} countries. It homes in on not only
   populations headed towards Europe, but those intending to remain in
   Sudan, notably Syrians, and explores the lessons and aporias of Sudan's
   hitherto open-door policy towards the latter.}},

Abstract = {{Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is now the predominant method for
   treatment of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms. Although EVAR has
   numerous advantages over standard open surgical repair, it also exposes
   patients to risks such as aneurysm sac enlargement, endoleaks, and graft
   migration, which make surveillance or follow-up mandatory. Fenestrated
   (FEVAR) and branched (BEVAR) endografts have extended the application of
   EVAR to juxtarenal, pararenal/paravisceral, and thoracoabdominal
   aneurysms, with some complex aneurysms requiring combined approaches
   (F-BEVAR). Duplex ultrasound has been recommended as an alternative to
   frequent computed tomography imaging for EVAR follow-up when it can
   provide the clinically necessary information. The major components of a
   post-EVAR duplex examination include measurement of aortic aneurysm sac
   size, assessment for endoleak, and evaluation of the endograft for
   patency and integrity. The duplex protocol for EVAR follow-up can be
   extended for follow-up after FEVAR, BEVAR, and F-BEVAR, with additional
   attention to the device components associated with fenestrations and
   branches. At the University of Washington, the physician- modified
   endovascular graft approach has been used for FEVAR. During these
   procedures, covered stents are placed in the renal arteries through
   fenestrations and the superior mesenteric artery is perfused through a
   fenestration, but typically remains unstented. Duplex scanning of the
   renal and mesenteric arteries has been performed preoperatively and at
   30 days, 6 months, 1 year, and annually. In a review of patients having
   covered stents placed in non-stenotic renal arteries during FEVAR, both
   peak systolic velocity and the renal to aortic velocity ratio remained
   below the standard significant stenosis threshold in most patients. The
   duplex velocity criteria for stenosis in native renal arteries appeared
   to overestimate the severity of stenosis in renal artery covered stents.
   The unstented superior mesenteric artery remained widely patent in the
   presence of fenestrations or crossing struts and was not associated with
   endoleaks. Duplex ultrasound protocols for follow-up after FEVAR, BEVAR,
   and F-BEVAR can be based on those that have been established for
   standard EVAR, along with assessment of fenestrations and branches, as
   well as patency of the renal and mesenteric arteries. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In Russia, initiatives for healthy ageing have been growing over the
   last two decades; however, none use an evidence-based (EB) approach. It
   is proposed that Kazan, a city with a population of over a million in
   the European part of Russia, has good chances of moving towards
   age-friendliness and contributing to raising awareness about healthy
   ageing through Cochrane evidence. One of the eight essential features of
   age-friendly cities by the World Health Organisation (WHO) directly
   points to health services. This exploratory study assesses the health
   information needs of the ageing population of Kazan and the challenges
   people face in improving their health and longevity. Survey data were
   used from 134 participants, patients, caregivers and healthcare
   providers of the Interregional Clinical Diagnostic Centre (ICDC), aged
   from 30 to over 80 years, and potential associations of the studied
   parameters with age, gender, quality of life and other characteristics
   were analysed. Older people (60+) were less positive about their quality
   of life, took medicines more often on a daily basis (10/16 compared to
   29/117 of people under 60), encountered problems with ageing (9/16
   compared to 21/117 of people under 60) and rated their quality of life
   as unsatisfactory (4/14 compared to 9/107 of people under 60). Awareness
   of EB approaches and Cochrane was higher within health professions
   (evidence-based medicine: 42/86 vs. 13/48; Cochrane: 32/86 vs. 2/48),
   and health information needs did not differ between age or gender groups
   or people with a satisfactory and unsatisfactory quality of life. The
   minority (10\%-13/134) were aware of ageism without age or gender
   differences. The low awareness calls for the need of Cochrane
   intervention both for consumers and those in the health profession to
   raise awareness to contribute to Kazan moving towards an age-friendly
   city.}},

Abstract = {{The work reports an investigation into the role played by the carbon
   residue from low-quality amorphous carbon nanotubes (aCNTs) and nitrogen
   doped aCNTs (aNCNTs) in the properties of solgel-synthesized TiO2 and
   NTiO2. The resutant modified nanohybrids are compared to nitrogen-doped
   TiO2 where the N is sourced from an ethylenediamine as an organic C and
   N precursor. The presence of carbon originating from ethylenediamine was
   confirmed by TGA and DTA while additional C doping originating from aCNT
   and aNCNT residues was confirmed by EDS and XRD spectroscopic
   techniques. XRD spectroscopy further demonstrated that the carbonaceous
   material residues resulted in the formation of TiC in TiO2-aCNT
   nanohybrids, and carbon nitride in NTiO2-aCNT nanohybrids. The TiC
   promoted photocatalytic performance of TiO2-aCNT nanohybrids while the
   carbon nitride residue increased charge recombination and thereby
   hampering the photocatalytic performance of NTiO2. A strong correlation
   exists between the optical properties and the photocatalytic performance
   in that NTiO2 has the lowest E-g (2.84 eV), second lowest charge
   recombination rate, and a high 2nd-order rate constant for the kinetics
   for CR dye removal. The TiO2-aCNT nanohybrids have the best overall
   performance in terms of dye adsorption, color removal through
   chemisorption, and UVA 254 TOC removal due to its low charge
   recombination. Therefore, the introduction of the carbonaceous materials
   into TiO(2 )significantly increases the adsorption capacity. Lastly, the
   presence of N in the carbonaceous materials further impedes the
   photocatalytic activity as observed by the low photocatalytic
   performance of NTiO2-aNCNT and TiO2-aNCNT nanohybrids.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: De-prescribing is a complex behavior that benefits from a
   multifaceted approach to learning. We sought to create and deliver a
   1-day interprofessional workshop to enhance de-prescribing knowledge and
   skills among health care professionals. Methods: Workshop development
   was based on the Adult Learning Theory and the Theoretical Domains
   Framework. The workshop addressed provider-related barriers, was created
   and delivered by an interprofessional team, and combined didactic and
   active learning techniques. Targeted participants included physicians,
   advanced practice providers (nurse practitioners and physician's
   assistants), pharmacists, and clinic staff. Interprofessional workgroups
   were created a priori. Participants were asked to complete a postprogram
   evaluation, including whether they would implement changes to practice,
   teaching, research, or administrative duties after participation.
   Results: We created an in-person, 5.5 credit hour, interprofessional
   de-prescribing workshop that comprised six sessions: (1) polypharmacy
   and de-prescribing overview; (2) identification of potentially
   inappropriate medications; (3) prioritization of medications for
   de-prescribing; (4) design and implementation of a de-prescribing plan;
   (5) principles for a patient-centered approach; and (6) suggestions for
   successful collaboration. Forty-one participants attended the workshop,
   and 38 (92.7\%) completed the postprogram assessment. Participants felt
   they were likely to implement changes in practice, teaching, research,
   or administrative duties, rating themselves with a mean of 9.2 (SD =
   1.06) on a 1 to 10 scale. Ultimately, 96.6\% would recommend the
   workshop to others. Discussion: Based on participant feedback, the
   workshop catalyzed intention to change practice, teaching, research, or
   administrative duties. Other institutions seeking to change the complex
   behavior of de-prescribing may wish to model this development and
   delivery strategy.}},

   ratio, interest to sales, asset turnover, days in accounts receivable,
   and duration of trade payables are the variables that increase the
   probability of financial failure, while repayment capacity and return on
   assets reduce the probability of failure. These variables present an
   overall classification rate of healthy and failing SMEs of 91.11\% three
   years before failure and of 84.44\% two years and one year before

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the possibility of using fundamental weighting as a tool
   to intentionally tilt a portfolio toward specific and unobservable risk
   factors in the illiquid and undeveloped Croatian stock market is
   explored. Thus far, fundamental-weighting has been shown to be able to
   outperform the cap-weighted index in such environments but no attempt
   regarding control for implicit factor exposure of such portfolios has
   been reported. Therefore, in this study principal component analysis is
   performed to capture the underlying risk factors of the
   fundamentally-weighted portfolio in order to optimize the portfolio's
   performance by minimizing its volatility. Previous attempts focusing
   purely on portfolio risk reduction by estimating minimum variance
   portfolios failed both from an in-sample and out-of-sample perspective.
   Results in this study are based on 22 in-sample and out-of-sample tests
   in the period from March 2009 till March 2020. On the in-sample
   estimation basis, the proposed approach significantly improves the
   portfolio's performance and, if restrictions to weights are imposed, it
   can outperform the cap-weighted benchmark. However, out-of-sample
   testing yielded poor results both in terms of risk and return. Such
   results are in contrast to findings for the developed markets but
   corroborate the claim that a broad investment base is needed for
   successful risk exposure in the long run.}},

Volume = {{93}},

Abstract = {{A serials of modified kaolinites were prepared by calcination and
   further acid treatment and charac-terized by in-situ XRD, N-2
   adsorption, NH3-TPD, Py-IR and Al-27 MAS-NMR. And their catalytic
   performance in pyrolysis of methanol/benzyl phenyl ether (MeOH-BPE), a
   model compound of low-rank coal, were investigated at 400 degrees C in a
   fixed-bed reactor to explore the correlation between the structure of
   modified samples and their catalytic performances. The results show that
   calcination temperature above 500 degrees C causes the collapse of
   kaolinite structure. Further acid leaching facilitates the formation of
   micropores and mesopores. The calcination of kaolinite leads to the
   transformation of six-coordinate Al atoms (Al-VI) into four and five
   coordinate species (Al-IV and Al-V), while the subsequent acid treatment
   increases the contents of Al-IV and Al-VI and removes Al-V. Total acid
   sites exhibit a first increase and then decrease tendency with the
   raising calcination temperature. In the presence of the modified
   kaolinites, BPE conversion significantly enhances and reaches the
   highest value of 91.41\% over K-A-70 0 prepared by calcination at 700
   degrees C of kaolinite and further acid leaching. Besides, the maximum
   content of phenol and toluene is also achieved due to the highest acid
   sites and Al-IV content of K-A-700, which favors the generation of
   H-center dot, thus resulting in an obvious inhibition of bibenzyl
   formation but a significant increase of 2-benzylphenol. In-situ
   pyrolysis by time-of-flight mass spectrometry suggests that the cleavage
   of C-al-O bond of BPE to form phenol radicals and benzyl radicals is the
   primary way, while insufficient H-center dot results in the formation of
   dominant product of 2-benzylphenol. (C) 2020 Energy Institute. Published

Abstract = {{This article is concerned with the moving horizon estimation (MHE)
   problem for networked linear systems (NLSs) with unknown inputs under
   dynamic quantization effects. For the NLSs with unknown input signals,
   the conventional MHE strategy is incapable of guaranteeing the
   satisfactory performance as the estimation error is dependent on the
   external disturbances. In this work, a novel MHE strategy is developed
   to cope with the underlying NLS with unknown inputs by dedicatedly
   introducing certain temporary estimates of unknown inputs, where the
   desired estimator parameters are designed to decouple the estimation
   error dynamics from the unknown inputs. A two-step design strategy
   (namely, decoupling step and convergence step) is proposed to obtain the
   estimator parameters. In the decoupling step, the decoupling parameter
   of the moving horizon estimator is designed based on certain assumptions
   on system parameters and quantization parameters. In the convergence
   step, by employing a special observability decomposition scheme, the
   convergence parameters of the moving horizon estimator are achieved such
   that the estimation error dynamics is ultimately bounded. Moreover, the
   developed MHE strategy is extended to the scenario with direct
   feedthrough of unknown inputs. Two simulation examples are given to
   demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed MHE
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{As generators and retailers can trade energy through either forward
   contracts or a pool in the electricity markets, we propose a
   hierarchical structure to capture the supply chain decision-making
   processes taking into account the interaction between the futures and
   spot markets. At each level, we model the sequential acting of
   generators and retailers as a Stackelberg game where generators behave
   as leaders and retailers behave as followers to maximise their
   individual payoff. Generators and retailers make decisions of the energy
   quantity in the spot market in the lower level with respect to the
   contracts signed in the futures market, while they determine contracts
   in the upper level with respect to the latest information from the spot
   market. After verifying the existence of the hierarchical equilibrium,
   we develop a decentralised algorithm to implement the equilibrium with
   only local information available for both generators and retailers. In
   the supply chain regime which incorporates both futures and spot
   markets, we show that it benefits the electricity market in reducing the
   pool price. The results are corroborated through numerical examples.}},

   background and a description of logistics, Logistics 4.0, warehouse
   systems, Warehouse 4.0 and modern approaches linked to Industry 4.0 that
   can be implemented in logistics. Then, the factors influencing the
   effectiveness of the warehouse are summarized - this is an original
   summary based on the available literature and other sources. After this,
   storage rationalization and the related costs are described. The main
   subject of the paper is explained in the second part of the paper, which
   concentrates on the proposal of a methodology for storage
   rationalization of warehouses in industrial companies. The individual
   steps in the storage rationalization are described. The purpose of the
   paper is to share information, firstly, about the summarised factors
   influencing the effectiveness of a warehouse and, secondly, about the
   methodology proposal itself. This information may inspire other research
   institutions to consider aspects of this subject matter, which could be

Title = {{Competency in Tubularized Incised Plate Repair for Distal Hypospadias:
   Cumulative Sum Learning Curve Analysis of a Single Surgeon Experience}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF UROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{204}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: We sought to determine the number of cases to achieve
   competency and proficiency in tubularized incised plate technique for
   distal hypospadias repair using cumulative sum analysis.
   Materials and Methods: From 2001 to 2015 we reviewed all distal
   tubularized incised plate repairs performed by a single surgeon since
   independent practice. Data for 450 consecutive cases included age,
   meatal location, presence of curvature, operative time, occurrence of
   complications and followup duration. A cumulative sum analysis cohort
   chart was used to determine trends in complication rate and operative
   time during the evaluation period. In order to account for surgical
   experience with time, the highest peak, plateau, and down trends in
   operative time and complication rate were identified on the plot and set
   as the transition points between learning (phase 1), competence (phase
   2) and proficiency (phase 3).
   Results: Based on the cumulative sum analysis learning curve, the
   competence phase with plateau of operative time and complication rate
   commences beyond the 127th case, and the proficiency phase with notable
   decline in operative time and complication rate was noted beyond the
   234th case. When comparing case characteristics and surgical outcomes
   between phases and learning curve, the proficiency phase involved
   younger patients and more severe degree of distal hypospadias being
   repaired using the tubularized incised plate approach with fewer
   complications related to meatal stenosis and fewer cosmetic
   complications.
   Conclusions: In our study competency in distal hypospadias tubularized
   incised plate repair was reached beyond the 127th case, while
   proficiency was attained beyond the 234th case.}},

Abstract = {{The voltage decay of lithium-rich layered oxides (LLOs) is still one of
   the key challenges for their application in commercial battery although
   these materials possess the advantages of high specific capacity and low
   cost. In this work, the relationship between voltage decay and tap
   density of LLOs has been focused. The voltage decay can be significantly
   suppressed with the increasing tap density as well as the homogenization
   of the primary or secondary particle size of agglomerated spherical
   LLOs. Experimental results have shown that an extreme small voltage
   decay of 0.98 mV cycle(-1) can be obtained through adjusting the tap
   density of agglomerated spherical LLOs to 1.99 g cm(-3), in which the
   size of primary and secondary particles are uniform. Our work offers a
   new insight towards the voltage decay and capacity fading of LLOs
   through precursor preparation process, promoting their application in
   the real battery in the future. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd on

Title = {{From natural disaster to pandemic: A health-system pharmacy rises to the
   challenge}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH-SYSTEM PHARMACY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{77}},
Number = {{23}},
Pages = {{1986-1993}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Purpose. This report describes a health-system pharmacy's response to a
   natural disaster while staff members simultaneously prepared for the
   coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. By detailing our
   experience, we hope to help other institutions that are current facing
   or could encounter similar crises.
   Summary. In early March 2020, a tornado destroyed the health system's
   warehouse for storage of most clinical supplies, including personal
   protective equipment and fluids. The pharmacy purchasing team
   collaborated with suppliers and manufacturers to recover losses and
   establish alternative storage areas. Days later, the pharmacy department
   was forced to address the impending COVID-19 pandemic. Key elements of
   the COVID-19 response included reducing the potential for virus exposure
   for patients and staff; overcoming challenges in sourcing of staff,
   personal protective equipment, and medications; and changing care
   delivery practices to maintain high-quality patient care while
   maximizing social distancing. The pharmacy department also created
   distance learning opportunities for 70 pharmacy students on rotations.
   After an initial plan, ongoing needs include adjustment in patient care
   activities if significant staff losses occur, when and how to resume
   clinical activities, and how to best utilize the resources accumulated.
   Elements of practice changes implemented to reduce COVID-19 threats to
   patients and pharmacy personnel have proven beneficial and will be
   further evaluated for potential continuation.
   Conclusion. The pharmacy department's efforts to respond to a natural
   disaster and unprecedented pandemic have proven successful to this point
   and have illuminated several lessons, including the necessity of
   cohesive department communication, staff flexibility, prioritization of
   teamwork, and external collaboration.}},

Abstract = {{In order to solve the problems of uneven thickness, poor hardness and
   wear resistance of traditional curved glass coating technology, a new
   three-dimensional (3D) curved glass hot-pressing technology of bionic
   nanomaterials was studied. According to the principle of machine vision,
   whether the curved glass to be coated meets the requirements of
   hot-pressing was checked. In addition, a biomimetic nanomaterial film
   was prepared through the mixed-solvent method. According to the
   characteristics of 3D curved glass at different temperatures, the
   parameters of the hot-press film machine were set, and the hot-press
   film machine was used to complete the research on the 3D curved glass
   hot-press film technology. Compared with the traditional curved glass
   film technology, the experimental results show that the new bionic
   nanomaterial 3D curved glass hot-pressing film technology can achieve
   uniform coating on the glass surface, and the hardness and wear
   resistance of the film are better than those of films produced by the
   traditional coating technology, showing that the new technology has
   great practical application value.}},

Abstract = {{Being different from the most methods of guided depth map enhancement
   based on deep convolutional neural network which focus on increasing the
   depth of networks, this paper is to improve the effectiveness of
   intensity guidance when the network goes deep. Overall, the proposed
   network upsamples the low-resolution depth maps from coarse to fine.
   Within each refinement stage of certain-scale depth features, the
   current-scale and all coarse-scales of the guidance features are
   revisited by dense connection. Therefore, the multi-scale guidance is
   efficiently maintained as the propagation of features. Furthermore, the
   proposed network maintains the intensity features in the high-resolution
   domain from which the multi-scale guidance is directly extracted. This
   design further improves the quality of intensity guidance. In addition,
   the shallow depth features upsampled via transposed convolution layer
   are directly transferred to the final depth features for reconstruction,
   which is called global residual learning in feature domain. Similarly,
   the global residual learning in pixel domain learns the difference
   between the depth ground truth and the coarsely upsampled depth map.
   Also, the local residual learning is to maintain the low frequency
   within each refinement stage and progressively recover the high
   frequency. The proposed method is tested for noise-free and noisy cases
   which compares against 16 state-of-the-art methods. Our experimental
   results show the improved performances based on the qualitative and
   quantitative evaluations.}},

Abstract = {{The gastropod family Ovulidae encompasses 269 currently accepted
   species, which are mostly associated with octocorals and are most
   diversified in the Indo-West Pacific. Species delimitation is
   challenging in Ovulidae: published molecular studies suggest that
   species have been greatly over-split, owing to a high morphological
   plasticity of species. Furthermore, available information on species
   distributions is often questionable owing to both the uncertainty
   regarding the status of morphologically defined species and
   incompleteness of regional checklists. In particular. the Philippines
   harbour the richest fauna of the Ovulidae, whereas only 12 species are
   documented from the over 1,000 km long Vietnamese coast of the South
   China Sea. In the present study, we aim to revise the ovulid fauna of
   Vietnam based on sampling from 5 localities spanning the entire length
   of the Vietnamese coast.
   We analyse 2 mitochondrial (COI and 16S rRNA) and 1 nuclear (28S rRNA)
   genes of 87 ovulid specimens from Vietnam to revisit species
   delimitation and evaluate the relationships and status of Vietnamese
   species. Of 18 ovulid species identified in the collected material, 13
   are recorded for the first time from Vietnam. Divergent mitochondrial
   lineages are revealed in Crenavolva traillii (A. Adams. 1856) and
   Phenacovolva rosea (A. Adams. 1855), suggesting ongoing speciation
   driven by host specialization.}},

   properties, physical properties, abrasion resistance, and
   freezing-thawing behavior were tested along with a microstructural
   characterization that included scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
   X-ray diffraction (XRD). In general, the effect of including crushed

Title = {{Effect of the transversal-spacing of stirrup-legs on the behavior and
   strength of shallow concealed RC beams}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{932-942}},
Month = {{JUN 21}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   Shallow concealed reinforced concrete (RC) beams (wide beams) make parts
   of a structure and are used in the construction industry, especially in
   ribbed and waffle slab systems. They are designed based on the
   requirements and provisions of structural codes of practice, which are
   applicable for shallow dropped RC beams (narrow beams). The main concern
   in regard to the behavior of these shallow concealed RC beams is
   transversal-spacing of stirrup-legs across their width. This paper aims
   to investigate the transversal-spacing of stirrups-legs (Sw) for two
   shallow concealed RC beams, namely, WB-SC and WB-EC.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The beams are tested under a three point-loading system. Their design
   has been performed to the SBC304 for beam WB-SC (Saudi Building Code for
   concrete structures) and comparison to EC2 for beam WB-EC (Eurocode-2
   for concrete structures) is addressed in terms of flexural and shear
   strength design requirements. Experimental behavior and results of both
   beams are analyzed and conclusions are provided; also, a comparison of
   these codes is performed. Both beams had dimensions of 3,400 mm length,
   700 mm width and 350 mm height.
   Findings
   Experimentally, beam WB-SC failed in flexure while beam WB-EC failed
   shear. The investigation concludes in favor of a safer design for SBC304
   Code compared to EC2 Code for designing shallow concealed RC beams.
   Originality/value
   This study recommends that the transversal-spacing of stirrups-legs of
   these beams has an influence on their strength and behavior and should
   not exceed the lesser of 0.56(d) or 170 mm (6.7 in.).}},

Title = {{Influence of the heterogeneity of waste from wet processing of
   ornamental stones on the performance of Portland cement composites}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{262}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{One of the difficulties of using some residues, such as those from
   stones beneficiation (cutting and polishing), is their heterogeneity.
   This study analyzes the influence of the heterogeneity of waste from wet
   processing of ornamental stones (marble, granite, slate, among others)
   on the performance of Portland cement composites when used at a 20\%
   replacement of cement. The mechanical behavior (compressive strength,
   flexural strength, and elastic modulus) and durability parameters
   (porosity, water absorption, carbonation, and electrical resistivity)
   are analyzed. Results indicate that the waste can present considerable
   heterogeneity while maintaining composites properties, indicating little
   influence on their physicochemical properties. It can be inferred that
   the filler effect of the waste compensated to a certain extent the
   negative effects (the increase in w/c ratio and the reduction of
   important hydrates) due to reduced cement content, showing its viability
   as mineral addition, despite its heterogeneity. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Flower classification with modified multimodal convolutional neural
   networks}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{159}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{The new multi-view learning algorithm is proposed by modifying an
   existing method, the multimodal convolutional neural networks originally
   developed for image-text matching (modified m-CNN), to use not only
   images but also texts for classification. Firstly, pre-trained CNN and
   word embedding models are applied to extract visual features and
   represent each word in a text as a vector, respectively. Secondly,
   textual features are extracted by employing a CNN model for text data.
   Finally, pairs of features extracted through the text and image CNNs are
   concatenated and input to convolutional layer which can obtain a better
   learn of the important feature information in the integrated
   representation of image and text. Features extracted from the
   convolutional layer are input to a fully connected layer to perform
   classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
   algorithm can obtain superior performance compared with other data
   fusion methods for flower classification using data of images of flowers
   and their Korean descriptions. More specifically, the accuracy of the
   proposed algorithm is 10.1\% and 14.5\% higher than m-CNN and multimodal
   recurrent neural networks algorithms, respectively. The proposed method
   can significantly improve the performance of flower classification. The
   code and related data are publicly available via our GitHub repository.

Title = {{Microplastic Exposure by Razor Clam Recreational Harvester-Consumers
   Along a Sparsely Populated Coastline}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Microplastics (MPs) are anthropogenic contaminants found in coastal and
   marine environments worldwide. Pacific razor clams (Siliqua patula),
   important for local indigenous culture, economy, gastronomy and food
   security along the United States West Coast, are subjected to myriad
   environmental stressors including predation, storm events, disease,
   toxins, and MPs. This study aimed to determine MP burdens in Olympic
   Coast, Washington Pacific razor clams and estimate annual MP exposure of
   recreational razor clam harvester-consumers from eating this species. We
   quantified suspected MP burdens in Pacific razor clams collected from
   eight tribal, recreational, and commercial harvest areas on the Olympic
   Coast in April 2018. We administered questionnaires to 107 recreational
   razor clam harvesters during the same timeframe to determine consumption
   patterns, preparation styles, knowledge and concerns about MPs, and
   demographics. Razor clams containing suspected MPs, primarily
   microfibers, were found at all eight sites. Average suspected MP burden
   differed by sample type (whole = 6.75 +/- 0.60, gut-tissue = 7.88 +/-
   0.71, non-gut tissue = 4.96 +/- 0.56, and cleaned samples = 3.44 +/-
   0.25). FTIR analyses of a random subset of microfiber-type MPs in whole
   and cleaned clams indicated material types of polyethylene
   terephthalate, cellulose acetate, cellophane, polyester, nylon, and
   cellulose. The average number of razor clams consumed per meal by
   Olympic Coast recreational razor clam harvesters was 4.27 +/- 0.27,
   which varied by gender and ethnicity, but not income or age. Harvesters
   ate 0-209 meals/year of razor clams (16.2\% harvested but did not eat
   razor clams), and most respondents (88.3\%) fully cleaned razor clams
   before consuming them. Annual suspected MP exposure for razor clam
   harvester-consumers was 60-3,070 for cleaned and 120-6,020 for whole
   clams. Our findings suggest Olympic Coast recreational razor clam
   harvester-consumers are exposed to low levels of MPs from eating razor
   clams. MP exposure can be reduced by roughly 50\% if clams are cleaned
   before consumption. Our work serves as an important reference in the
   growing portfolio of Pacific Northwest microplastic research, to inform
   future MP attenuation recommendations and development of human health
   standards for this type of pollution.}},

   properties of Portland cement paste}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{262}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{The effect of early-age frost damage on the hydration characteristics,
   pore structure and compressive strength of cement paste and the repair
   effect of nano-SiO2 on the damaged microstructure were investigated. The
   samples were prepared with nano-SiO2 content of 0\% and 0.9\% by weight
   of cement. The mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) data indicated that
   early-age frost damage can result in a part of small pores (20-100 nm)
   to become larger pores (100-300 nm) and nano-SiO(2 )particles can reduce
   the pores between 100 and 300 nm by the additional produced C-S-H gels
   and physical particle filling. The thermo-gravimetric (TG) results
   displayed the reductions in the hydration degree and the amount of C-S-H
   gels, while the pozzolanic nano-SiO2 particles reduced these losses to
   some extent. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms
   showed that early-age frost damage affected the structure of C-S-H gels
   formed and the attenuated-total-reflection (ATR) spectrums also
   indicated that it affected the polymerization of C-S-H gel silicate
   chains. Moreover, during the early-age freezing, the cement hydration
   reaction did not stop immediately but proceeded slowly until the
   non-freezable water was consumed out. The incorporation of nano-SiO2 can
   slightly enhance the compressive strength and hydration degree of cement
   pastes during the early-age freezing. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{A machine learning study of the dynamic modulus of asphalt concretes: An
   application of M5P model tree algorithm}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{262}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Dynamic modulus of asphalt concrete, which is a key parameter
   characterizing its performance, can be either measured in the laboratory
   through time-taking and expensive experiments or estimated through
   predictive models. In this study, the M5P model tree algorithm is used
   to develop the predictive models of the dynamic modulus of asphalt
   concretes. Compared to other machine learning-based techniques, the M5P
   algorithm is easy-to-use and provides more understandable linear
   mathematical expressions between the input and output variables. To
   develop the predictive models, a dataset containing information on the
   binder properties, gradation characteristics, volumetric properties, and
   test conditions was collected from the literature. Due to the highly
   skewed distribution of the output variable (i.e., dynamic modulus),
   separate predictive models were developed using the real and logarithmic
   values of dynamic modulus. The performance of the developed models was
   evaluated and compared with that of the Witczak, Hirsch, Al-Khateeb et
   al., and ANN models as the most commonly accepted predictive models of
   dynamic modulus. The findings of this study show that the models
   developed using the M5P algorithm outperform the previously developed
   models. Moreover, a logarithmic transformation of the dynamic modulus
   values significantly improved the performance of the model. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{A promising solution to improve the performance of Bulk heterojunction
   organic photovoltaic devices is the insertion of functionalized
   self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) at the interface between the Electron
   Transporting Layer (ETL) and the active layer. By grafting such dipolar
   SAMs based on Y-PP-COOH (P = Phenyl, YY = CH3O, F)) on a ZnO ETL, both
   the electronic and the chemical properties of the interface are
   modified. The growth of the active blend the
   poly(3-hexylthiophene)-{[}6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methylester blend
   deposited onto the SAMs is also altered. The dipole with a component
   oriented perpendicularly to the ZnO surface modifies the ZnO work
   function whereas the surface energy of the SAM influences the
   microstructuration of the active material. When we analyze the inverted
   photovoltaic cell, we find that the two effects may be distinguished:
   the CH3O moiety favorably affects the electrical transfer of carriers
   with mainly an improvement of the open-circuit voltage V-oc whereas
   fluorine disfavors both electron extraction and blend microstructure
   quality, with a lower V-oc and electrical current density J(sc).}},

   Scale, and two sub-scales of the Key Leadership Behaviors, namely:
   Helping people to grow and lead, and Enabling learning and innovation.
   Socio-demographic data were collected as well. Findings revealed that
   leaders' actions oriented toward the enablement of learning and
   innovation have an effect on volunteers' affective commitment, through
   the full mediation of volunteer satisfaction. Leaders' actions oriented

Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{262}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental investigation of the hygrothermal
   and mechanical properties of green concrete containing different content
   and size of flax shives. This allows it to respond to different
   applications in the building domain. Results of microscopic observations
   by using scanning electron microscopy show that the flax shives have a
   very complex and porous microstructure. The latter allowed for good
   hydric and thermal behaviour with a high moisture buffer capacity of
   which the minimum and maximum were 2.03 and 2.82, respectively. This
   allows it to be classified as an excellent moisture regulator. Flax
   concrete with a mass composition of 14.5\% of flax shives in bulk, 35\%
   of binder (tradical PF70) and a water-to-binder ratio of 1.45 gave a
   bio-based material with an average compressive strength of 0.8 MPa; it
   is, therefore, used as an insulation and filling material in buildings.

Abstract = {{Background Considerable attention is rightly paid to preventable deaths

   Method This paper forms part of a larger cross-sectional study of deaths

   from VOICES-SF were obtained from intellectual disability service
   providers for each death within their supported population over 18
   months, 149 decedents in all.
   Results Only 34.2\% of deaths were anticipated, death was often sudden
   or followed a short illness. Four dying trajectories were identified,
   and categorized by length of illness, service use, care outcomes,
   symptom control and cause of death.
   Conclusions Recognition that most deaths in this group were
   unanticipated implies a need for better preparation for less expected
   dying and better anticipation. A descriptive epidemiology of dying among
   people with intellectual disabilities is needed.}},

Abstract = {{School science is often very different from ``real world{''} science.
   One important difference, and possibly the main one, is that in school
   science the relationships between variables have often been sanitized -
   essentially ``cleaned up{''} - so that there is very little (and often
   no) variation in the data from the relationship students are being
   taught about. This happens because school science often (a) deals with
   ``settled{''} or ``consensus{''} science where scientists have
   essentially agreed on what the relationships between the variables are;
   (b) involves bivariate (i.e., two-variable) relationships where all
   other variables that might be in a ``real world{''} relationship have
   been identified and are removed from the example dataset/activity (e.g.,
   minimizing friction so it becomes negligible to understand movement);
   and, (c) involve known ``controlled variables{''} that can be easily
   controlled to reduce their influence on the outcomes. This type of
   removal of variation is problematic as it can make it more difficult for
   students to learn about, understand, and make sense of ``real world{''}
   data relationships outside of school settings. It is therefore important
   for them to engage in school investigations that help them learn to make
   sense of data with considerable variation in the measured variables.
   This paper describes and discusses such an activity.}},

Title = {{Study of the influence of interface normal stresses on the bond behavior
   of FRCM composites using direct shear and modified beam tests}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{262}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{In the last decades, the increasing need for strengthening and
   retrofitting of existing masonry members has led the scientific
   community toward the development of innovative strengthening systems.
   Among these systems, inorganic-matrix composite materials have been
   gaining increasing popularity due to their effectiveness, relatively low
   cost, ease of the application, and reversibility of the intervention.
   Inorganic-matrix composites, usually referred to as fiber- (or fabric-)
   reinforced cementitious matrix (FRCM) composites, were successfully used
   as externally bonded reinforcement (EBR) of masonry members subjected to
   various load combinations. However, their effectiveness is strictly
   related to the FRCM-substrate bond behavior. Therefore, numerous set-ups
   were employed to investigate the bond properties of FRCM composites.
   Among them, single-lap direct shear test set-ups were the most commonly
   employed and are now recommended by available design guidelines for FRCM
   composites.
   In this paper, a modified beam (MB) test set-up is used to study the
   bond behavior of two different FRCM composites: a polyparaphenylene
   benzobisoxazole (PBO) FRCM and a carbon FRCM. The parameters studied are
   the dimensions of the blocks used in the MB tests and the presence of
   bare or embedded fibers at the gap between the blocks. The bond behavior
   observed is compared with that of single-lap direct shear tests of the
   same FRCM composites. The results obtained provide an insight on the
   influence of normal stress components at the matrix-fiber interface on
   the FRCM bond behavior, which may play an important role in the capacity
   of FRCM strengthened curved members. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   increase nighttime risk of ship strikes in northern Chilean Patagonia}},
Journal = {{INTEGRATIVE ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{4, SI}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The northern Chilean Patagonia region is a key feeding ground and a
   nursing habitat in the southern hemisphere for blue whales (Balaenoptera
   musculus). From 2014 to 2019, during 6 separate research cruises, the
   dive behavior of 28 individual blue whales was investigated using
   bio-logging tags (DTAGs), generating approximate to 190 h of data.
   Whales dove to significantly greater depths during the day compared to
   nighttime (day: 32.6 +/- 18.7 m; night: 6.2 +/- 2.7 m; P < 0.01). During
   the night, most time was spent close to the surface (86\% +/- 9.4\%; P <
   0.01) and at depths of less than 12 m. From 2016 to 2019, active
   acoustics (scientific echosounders) were used to record prey
   (euphausiids) density and distribution simultaneously with whale diving
   data. Tagged whales appeared to perform dives relative to the vertical
   migration of prey during the day. The association between diurnal prey
   migration and shallow nighttime dive behavior suggests that blue whales
   are at increased risk of ship collisions during periods of darkness
   since the estimated maximum ship draft of vessels operating in the
   region is also approximate to 12 m. In recent decades, northern Chilean
   Patagonia has seen a large increase in marine traffic due to a boom in
   salmon aquaculture and the passenger ship industry. Vessel strike risks
   for large whales are likely underestimated in this region. Results
   reported in this study may be valuable for policy and mitigation
   decisions regarding conservation of the endangered blue whale.}},

Abstract = {{A combination of Hoek-Brown strength criterion and geological strength
   index (GSI) rock mass classification is a common method to determine
   rock mass strength. However, the conventional method involving the
   determination of disturbance coefficient (D) cannot reflect the
   anisotropic characteristics of strength of jointed rock mass when
   considering mining damage. A numerical analysis method is proposed to
   determine the value of D using jointed rock damage tensor and mining
   damage evolution simulation. The anisotropy of rock mass strength at
   different mining depths for a high jointed rock slope in Dagushan
   open-pit mine was analyzed by mining damage simulation. Additionally,
   the Rosenblueth moment point estimation principle was combined with
   Monte-Carlo method to obtain the random strength of a jointed rock mass
   considering the effects of mining probability damage. The results show
   that the influence of the unloading due to excavation to stress state of
   rock mass is relatively obvious within 100 m away from the slope
   surface, however, the area of drastic change of damage is limited to a
   range of similar to 50 m. Moreover, the reliability of local slope,
   analyzed using limit equilibrium method (Janbu), shows that
   consideration of spatiotemporal anisotropy of rock mass with mining
   damage is closer to reality.}},

Abstract = {{The transfer processes of reactants and products affect each other in
   proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), because they have contrast
   transfer directions between flow channels and gas diffusion layers
   (GDLs). In this study, a two-dimensional, two-phase, non-isothermal and
   steady state model is developed to analyze the species transportation
   behaviors through diffusion and convection in PEMFCs with
   orientated-type flow channels. Five conventional shape baffles effects
   on mass transfers are compared, and the relationships between convection
   and diffusion of reactants and produced water vapor are discussed.
   Simulation results reveal that baffle shapes affect the mass
   transportation through the baffles leading angles and volumes, and
   larger leading angles enhance the reactants and the water vapor
   convective transferring into GDLs; meanwhile, larger baffle volumes
   enhance the reactant transferring into GDLs and water vapor transferring
   out from GDLs through diffusion processes. In addition, transportation
   processes of reactants and vapor affect each other, where more reactants
   convectively transferring into GDLs causes more water vapor entering
   GDLs; enhancing the reactants diffusively transferring into GDLs reduces
   water vapor diffusive transportation out from GDLs.}},

Title = {{Emergence of Beta Oscillations of a Resonance Model for Parkinson's
   Disease}},
Journal = {{NEURAL PLASTICITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{In Parkinson's disease, the excess of beta oscillations in
   cortical-basal ganglia (BG) circuits has been correlated with normal
   movement suppression. In this paper, a physiologically based resonance
   model, generalizing an earlier model of the STN-GPe circuit, is employed
   to analyze critical dynamics of the occurrence of beta oscillations,
   which correspond to Hopf bifurcation. With the experimentally measured
   parameters, conditions for the occurrence of Hopf bifurcation with time
   delay are deduced by means of linear stability analysis, center manifold
   theorem, and normal form analysis. It is found that beta oscillations
   can be induced by increasing synaptic transmission delay. Furthermore,
   it is revealed that the oscillations originate from interaction among
   different synaptic connections. Our analytical results are consistent
   with the previous experimental and simulating findings, thus may provide
   a more systematic insight into the mechanisms underlying the transient
   beta bursts.}},

Title = {{Effect of printing parameters on interlayer bond strength of 3D printed

   and numerical study}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{262}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{For a single batch material, time intervals and nozzle standoff
   distances between two subsequent layers are two critical printing
   parameters that influence the mechanical performance of the printed
   concrete. This paper presents an experimental and numerical study to
   investigate the impacts of these printing parameters on the interlayer
   bond strength of the 3D printed limestone and calcined clay-based
   cementitious materials. All samples were manufactured by a lab-scale 3D
   printer equipped with a hybrid back-and down-flow nozzle (rectangular
   opening). The uniaxial tensile test was employed to quantify the
   interface adhesion of printed specimens. Moreover, the greyscale value
   image of microstructure, as well as the air void content and
   distribution of the printed specimens were acquired by X-ray computed
   tomography and characterized by image analysis. The experimental results
   showed that extending the time interval between construction of two
   layers could decrease the bond strength, whereas only increasing the
   nozzle standoff distance exhibited limited effects on that. The weak
   bond strength could be attributed to the high local porosity at the
   interface of the specimen. Additionally, numerical simulations of the
   uniaxial tensile test were conducted using a 2D lattice fracture model,
   which can predict the bond strength of printed specimens for different
   void content in the interface layer. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{20}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{4f intermediate valence (IV) compounds are canonical hosts of correlated
   electron physics and can contribute to our understanding of the larger
   class of correlated electron materials. Here we study the prototype IV
   compound YbAl3 which exhibits a nonintegral valence with a moderately
   heavy fermion ground state and a large Kondo temperature (T-K similar to
   500-600 K). To better characterize the correlated physics of YbAl3, we
   have measured the phonon and the magnetic excitation spectra on single
   crystals of this material by time-of-flight inelastic neutron scattering
   and inelastic x-ray scattering. We have also performed theoretical
   calculations of the phonon spectra. We present three findings of these
   measurements. First, we observe that the measured phonon spectra can be
   described adequately by a calculation based on standard DFT+ U density
   functional theory. The calculated energies, however, are 10\% too low
   compared to the measured energies. This discrepancy may reflect a
   hardening of the phonons due to dynamic 4f correlations. Second, the
   low-temperature spin fluctuations on the Kondo energy scale k(B)T(K)
   have a momentum (Q) dependence similar to that seen recently in the IV
   compound CePd3. For that system, the Q dependence has been attributed to
   particle-hole excitations in a coherent itinerant 4f correlated ground
   state. We suggest a similar origin for the momentum dependence seen in
   YbAl3. This Q dependence disappears as the temperature is raised towards
   room temperature and the 4f electron band states become increasingly
   incoherent. Such a coherent/incoherent crossover is expected to be
   generic for correlated electron systems. Third, a low-temperature
   magnetic peak observed in the neutron scattering near 30 meV shows
   dispersion identical to a particular optic-phonon branch. This 4f
   /phonon resonance disappears for T >= 150 K. The phonon spectrum appears
   to be unaffected by the resonance. We discuss several possibilities for
   the origin of this unusual excitation, which may be unique to YbAl3. We
   suggest that the excitation may arise from the large amplitude beating
   of the light Al atoms against the heavy Yb atoms, resulting in a dynamic
   4f/3p hybridization.}},

Abstract = {{Background Nonoperative management after neoadjuvant treatment in low
   rectal cancer enables organ preservation and avoids surgical morbidity.
   Our aim is to compare oncological outcomes in patients with clinical
   complete response in watch and wait strategy with those who received
   neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery with a pathological complete
   response. Methods Patients with non-metastatic rectal cancer after
   neoadjuvant treatment with clinical complete response in watch and wait
   approach (group 1, n = 26) and complete pathological responders (ypT0N0)
   after chemoradiotherapy and surgery (group 2, n = 22), between January
   2011 and October 2018, were included retrospectively, and all of them
   evaluated and followed in a multidisciplinary team. A comparative
   analysis of local and distant recurrence rates and disease-free and
   overall survival between both groups was carried out. Statistical
   analysis was performed using log-rank test, Cox proportional hazards
   regression model, and Kaplan-Meier curves. Results No differences were
   found between patient's demographic characteristics in both groups.
   Group 1: distance from the anal verge mean 5 cm (r = 1-12), 10 (38\%)
   stage III, and 7 (27\%) circumferential resection margin involved. The
   median follow-up of 47 months (r = 6, a 108). Group 2: distance from the
   anal verge mean 7 cm (r = 2-12), 16 (72\%) stage III, and 13 (59\%)
   circumferential resection margin involved. The median follow-up 49.5
   months (r = 3, a 112). Local recurrence: 2 patients in group 1 (8.3\%)
   and 1 in group 2 (4.8\%) (p = 0.6235). Distant recurrence: 1 patient in
   group 1 (3.8\%) and 3 in group 2 (19.2\%) (p = 0.2237). Disease-free
   survival: 87.9\% in group 1, 80\% in group 2 (p = 0.7546). Overall
   survival: 86\% in group 1 and 85\% in group 2 (p = 0.5367). Conclusion
   Oncological results in operated patients with pathological complete
   response were similar to those in patients under a watch and wait
   strategy mediating a systematic and personalized evaluation. Surgery can
   safely be deferred in clinical complete responders.}},

Title = {{Characterization of alternating neurogenic motor patterns in mouse colon}},
Journal = {{NEUROGASTROENTEROLOGY AND MOTILITY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{33}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Background Colonic motor complexes (CMCs) have been widely recorded in
   the large intestine of vertebrates. We have investigated whether in the
   smooth muscle, a single unified pattern of electrical activity, or
   different patterns of electrical activity give rise to the different
   neurogenic patterns of motility underlying CMCs in vitro.
   Methods To study differences of the CMCs between proximal and distal
   colon, we used a novel combination of techniques to simultaneously
   record muscle diameter and force at multiple sites along the whole mouse
   colon ex vivo. In addition, electrical activity of smooth muscle was
   recorded by suction electrodes.
   Key Results Two distinct types of CMCs were distinguished; CMCs that
   propagated along the entire colon (complete CMC) and CMCs which were
   restricted to the proximal colon (incomplete CMC). The two types of CMC
   often occurred in the same preparations. Incomplete CMCs had longer
   bursts of smooth muscle action potentials than complete CMCs and
   propagated more slowly. Interestingly, both types of CMC were associated
   with similar frequency bursts of smooth muscle action potentials at
   similar to 2.4 Hz. In the most proximal colon, an additional firing
   frequency was detected close to similar to 7 Hz generating multiple
   peaks within each CMC.
   Conclusions \& Inferences We report distinct characteristics underlying
   complete and incomplete CMCs in isolated mouse colon. Recognizing these
   distinct patterns of motility will be important for future
   interpretation of analysis of murine colonic motility recordings. The
   identification of alternating patterns of motor activity in proximal
   colon, but not distal colon may reflect specific neural mechanisms for
   fecal pellet formation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the first results of the effect of an industrial
   closed-system thermal modification process on the physical properties of
   fast-growth teak wood (Tectona grandis L.f.). The wood (juvenile) came
   from thinning a 15-18-year-old plantation located in Mato Grosso state,
   Midwest Brazil, broken down into plainsawn battens measuring 25 x 70 x 1
   070 mm (radial x tangential x longitudinal). The battens were from
   material close to the pith which was combined heartwood (approximate to
   75\%) and sapwood. We sampled untreated and thermally modified battens,
   which were transformed into specimens for testing. The thermal
   modification was carried out at 160 degrees C in an industrial scale
   reactor, according to the parameters of the TanWood process, which is
   classified as a closed hygrothermal system. Twelve specimens by
   treatment (25 x 60 x 50 mm3 - radial x tangential x longitudinal) were
   conditioned in a climatic chamber set up at 35 degrees C and the
   relative humidity (RH) was raised stepwise (31\%, 49\%, 69\% and 81\%).
   Apparent density and equilibrium moisture content of the specimens were
   measured at every step. The latter was used as an index of wood
   hygroscopicity. For the statistical analysis, only the results of
   apparent density and moisture content at 35 degrees C and 69\% RH were
   compared. At the end of the conditioning, the specimens were saturated
   in water, followed by oven-drying and then the total swelling (from
   saturated to oven-dried) was calculated. Thermally modified wood became
   less dense, less hygroscopic and more dimensionally stable than
   untreated wood. The apparent density and the equilibrium moisture
   content of wood were reduced by 20\% and 18\% respectively. With the
   continuous increase of RH from 31\% to 81\%, the thermally modified wood
   proportionally adsorbed less water than the untreated wood. The radial,
   tangential and volumetric total swelling were reduced by 25\%, 5\% and
   15\% respectively.}},

Title = {{TiO2 coated fiber cement composites: Effect of the load of TiO2
   particles on photocatalytic degradation of H2S}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{262}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{This paper evaluated the effect of the amount of mass of the commercial
   photocatalyst Fotosan (R) (PC) based on TiO2 in the modification of the
   textural and morphological characteristics of the coatings formed in
   fiber cement supports (FB). The effect of mass addition on
   photocatalytic activity was also evaluated using the hydrogen sulfide
   degradation reaction (H2S) as a parameter. For this, five treatments
   conducted by different amounts of PC mass per area of FB in the range of
   5.3 to 14.4 mg cm(-2 )were evaluated. The surfaces formed by these
   photocatalytic coatings (PCFB) were characterized by scanning electron
   microscopy with X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), X-ray
   diffractometry (XRD), nitrogen adsorption-desorption (BET) isotherms and
   infrared spectroscopy with total attenuated reflection (ATR-FTIR).
   The results of nitrogen isotherms confirmed that the coatings formed
   have a large specific pore volume (3.6 x 10(-2) to 5.6 x 10(-2) cm(3)
   g(-1)) and a high specific surface area (18.9 to 29.9 m(2) g(-1)). It
   was verified that the variation of PC mass over FB significantly
   affected the textural characteristics and the morphological structure of
   PCFB when comparing means between treatments (Tukey test; alpha = 5\%),
   and probably these characteristics correlate with the respective
   photocatalytic activity. The modification of the structural properties
   produced by the accumulation of PC mass was more beneficial when the
   coatings were formed with a dosage of 7.3 mg cm(-2), because it
   corresponded to the treatment where photocatalytic activity showed
   maximum intensity in the reaction of H2S degradation (72\%) and a
   minimum amount of PC used in comparison to other treatments. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{The media landscape is subject to constant change; innovative media
   technologies increasingly influence the world we live in. While digital
   media are increasingly being consumed by all age groups and laypersons
   frequently obtain information on health and medical topics on the
   Internet, the question of the quality of (journalistic) content on the
   Web arises. The roles of journalists are changing and scientists are
   experiencing new opportunities and challenges in the digital
   distribution of research results. Which qualitative requirements have to
   be met by these contents and which potentials and opportunities, but
   also risks, do online disseminated and received information entail? This
   article describes the topics of medical and health communication and the
   processes of journalistic reporting. Subsequently, we discuss the
   criterion of ``evidence,{''} which is already established in medicine,
   as a possible approach to the evaluation of health-relevant and medical
   information. Finally, we discuss the corona pandemic in the context of

Title = {{The strength oriented mix design for geopolymer concrete using Taguchi
   method and Indian concrete mix design code}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{262}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{This paper represents the mix design of geopolymer concrete based on the
   target strength criteria by optimizing the proportions of the
   constituents using Taguchi method. The guidelines of IS:10262-2019 were
   followed for the mix design. The GPC contains a broader range of
   constituents. Therefore, numerous trial mixes are required to obtain the
   mix for the best strength of the GPC mix. Moreover, the conventional mix
   design of GPC does not target the strength. In this study, the mix
   design based on the strength criterion is proposed and optimized by the
   Taguchi method, considering all primary constituents and their
   proportions. The tests for workability, compressive strength, and
   splitting tensile strength were included. The test results showed
   excellent agreement with the target strength values. The study
   encouraged the development of the strength-based mix design of GPC as
   per the code and optimized by the Taguchi method, avoiding enormous
   trials and approximations for the mix design of GPC. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A sensitive and specific hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC)
   method for the separation and determination of dimethylamine (DMA) in
   active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and in dosage forms of
   metformin (MET) has been developed and validated. A feasible analytical
   method based on HILIC coupled with mass spectrometry detection
   (HILIC-MS) was established using a simple sample preparation. The
   separation of MET was achieved on a Cortecs HILIC column using a mixture
   of 10 mmol/L ammonium formate adjusted to pH 4.8 and acetonitrile
   (25:75, v/v) at 0.8 mL/min flow rate. The a single-quadrupole mass
   detector was operated in positive ion mode. Quadrupole mass analyser was
   employed in selected ion monitoring mode using a target ion at m/z = 46
   as {[}M+H](+). The HILIC-MS method was validated as per International
   Council on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines in terms of linearity, limit
   of detection, limit of quantification, selectivity, accuracy, precision
   and intermediate precision. The main benefit of the HILIC-MS method is a
   simple sample pretreatment and a quick and sensitive HILIC-MS analysis.
   The method was demonstrated to be applicable for the determination of
   DMA in routine quality control evaluation of commercial samples of
   metformin of both API and dosage forms. The HILIC-MS method was
   developed as a simpler and faster alternative to compendial method for
   determination of DMA (as specific impurity F) in MET described in
   European Pharmacopoeia. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{An efficient convolutional neural network for coronary heart disease
   prediction}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{159}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{This study proposes an efficient neural network with convolutional
   layers to classify significantly class-imbalanced clinical data. The
   data is curated from the National Health and Nutritional Examination
   Survey (NHANES) with the goal of predicting the occurrence of Coronary
   Heart Disease (CHD). While the majority of the existing machine learning
   models that have been used on this class of data are vulnerable to class
   imbalance even after the adjustment of class-specific weights, our
   simple two-layer CNN exhibits resilience to the imbalance with fair
   harmony in class-specific performance. Given a highly im-balanced
   dataset, it is often challenging to simultaneously achieve a high class
   1 (true CHD prediction rate) accuracy along with a high class 0
   accuracy, as the test data size increases. We adopt a two-step approach:
   first, we employ least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)
   based feature weight assessment followed by majority-voting based
   identification of important features. Next, the important features are
   homogenized by using a fully connected layer, a crucial step before
   passing the output of the layer to successive convolutional stages. We
   also propose a training routine per epoch, akin to a simulated annealing
   process, to boost the classification accuracy.
   Despite a high class imbalance in the NHANES dataset, the investigation
   confirms that our proposed CNN architecture has the classification power
   of 77\% to correctly classify the presence of CHD and 81.8\% to
   accurately classify the absence of CHD cases on a testing data, which is
   85.70\% of the total dataset. This result signifies that the proposed
   architecture can be generalized to other studies in healthcare with a
   similar order of features and imbalances. While the recall values
   obtained from other machine learning methods, such as SVM and random
   forest, are comparable to that of our proposed CNN model, our model
   predicts the negative (Non-CHD) cases with higher accuracy. Our model
   architecture exhibits a way forward to develop better investigative
   tools, improved medical treatment and lower diagnostic costs by
   incorporating a smart diagnostic system in the healthcare system. The
   balanced accuracy of our model (79.5\%) is also better than individual
   accuracies of SVM or random forest classifiers. The CNN classifier
   results in high specificity and test accuracy along with high values of
   recall and area under the curve (AUC). (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   Molar incisor hypo-mineralization is a malformation with a systemic
   background for which aetiology is not well defined. Prevalence of these
   lesions varies in different countries, but few studies have been
   conducted on its prevalence in the Iranian society. The aim of this
   study was to determine the prevalence of molar incisor hypo
   mineralization among 8-10-year-old children in Ardabil and its
   relationship with prenatal and postnatal factors.
   METHODS
   In this analytical cross-sectional study, participants included 520
   children from public schools of Ardabil. In the first stage, the
   frequency of MIH was determined by a clinical examination based on the
   index introduced by Tourino et al. Then, they were evaluated in two
   groups (with or without incisor hypo mineralization) to determine the
   causative factors. To collect information, a questionnaire including
   information about factors before and after birth was used. Data were
   analysed using SPSS 18 software. Chi-square and T-test and logistic
   regression were used to test the relationship between different factors.
   RESULTS
   The prevalence of molar-incisor hypo mineralization in children aged
   8-10-year-old in Ardabil was estimated to be 24 \%. The results also
   showed that there is a significant relationship between prenatal and
   postnatal factors (p < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS
   Due to the high prevalence of MIH in Ardabil, preventive measures,
   informing the parents and periodic examination of the teeth are
   recommended.}},

Title = {{Laser cooling of transition-metal atoms}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{We propose the application of laser cooling to a number of
   transition-metal atoms, allowing numerous bosonic and fermionic atomic
   gases to be cooled to ultralow temperatures. The nonzero electron
   orbital angular momentum of these atoms implies that strongly
   atom-state-dependent light-atom interactions occur even for light that
   is far-detuned from atomic transitions. At the same time, many
   transition-metal atoms have small magnetic dipole moments in their
   low-energy states, reducing the rate of dipolar-relaxation collisions.
   Altogether, these features provide compelling opportunities for future
   ultracold-atom research. Focusing on the case of atomic titanium, we
   identify the metastable a(5)F(5) state as supporting a J -> J + 1
   optical transition with properties similar to the D-2 transition of
   alkali-metal atoms, and suited for laser cooling. The high total angular
   momentum and electron spin of this state suppresses leakage out of the
   nearly closed optical transition to a branching ratio estimated below
   similar to 10(-5). Following the pattern exemplified by titanium, we
   identify optical transitions that are suited for laser cooling of
   elements in the scandium group (Sc, Y, La), the titanium group (Ti, Zr),
   the vanadium group (V, Nb), the manganese group (Mn, Tc), and the iron
   group (Fe, Ru).}},

Title = {{The Impact of Age and Pathogens Type on the Gut Microbiota in Infants

Journal = {{CANADIAN JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES \& MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Diarrhea in infants is a serious gastrointestinal dysfunction
   characterized by vomiting and watery bowel movements. Without proper
   treatment, infants will develop a dangerous electrolyte imbalance.
   Diarrhea is accompanied by intestinal dysbiosis. This study compared the
   gut microbiota between healthy infants and diarrheic infants. It also
   investigated the effects of age and pathogen type on the gut microbiota
   of infants with diarrhea, providing data for the proper treatment for
   diarrhea in infants. Materials and Methods. DNA was collected from the
   fecal samples of 42 Chinese infants with diarrhea and 37 healthy
   infants. The healthy infants and infants with diarrhea were divided into
   four age groups: 0-120, 120-180, 180-270, and 270-365 days. Using PCR
   and 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing, the diarrhea-causing pathogens
   in these infants were identified and then categorized into four groups:
   Salmonella infection, Staphylococcus aureus infection, combined
   Salmonella and Staphylococcus aureus infection, and others (neither
   Salmonella nor Staphylococcus aureus). Results. The species diversity of
   gut microbiota in diarrheic infants was significantly reduced compared
   with that in healthy infants. Infants with diarrhea had a lower
   abundance of Lactobacillus spp. and Bacillus spp. (P<0.001) and a
   significant richness of Klebsiella spp. and Enterobacter spp. (P<0.001).
   Similar gut microbiota patterns were found in diarrheic infants in all
   four age groups. However, different pathogenic infections have
   significant effects on the gut microbiota of diarrheic infants. For
   instance, the relative abundance of Klebsiella spp. and Streptococcus
   spp. was significantly increased (P<0.001) in infants infected with
   Staphylococcus aureus; meanwhile, the richness of bacteria such as
   Enterobacter spp. was significantly increased in the Salmonella
   infection group (P<0.001). Conclusion. The microbiota in infants with
   diarrhea has changed significantly, characterized by decreased species
   diversity and abundance of beneficial bacteria and significant increase
   in the proportion of conditional pathogens. Meanwhile, the gut
   microbiota of infants with diarrhea at different ages was similar, but
   different pathogenic infections affect the gut microbiota
   characteristics. Therefore, early identification of changes in gut
   microbiota in infants with diarrhea and the adoption of appropriate
   pathogen type-specific interventions may effectively alleviate the
   disease and reduce adverse reactions.}},

   in open areas without collection and proper recycling or damping. The
   ornamental stone factories, necessary for the decoration of the
   contemporary constructions, produce fine limestone dust (FLSD), which
   was elucidated as an example in this study. A huge amount of FLSD is
   released from this industry. The incorporation of a high volume of FLSD
   and hybrid combination of steel fibers and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)
   microfibers in the production of high-performance concrete (HPC) was the
   main objective of the study. The replacement level of 45\% FLSD has
   enabled a high dispersion of 0.35\% PVA microfibers in the presence of
   1\% steel fibers of the total mix volume. Moreover, the presence of FLSD
   has also mitigated the occurrence of PVA balling effect, which often
   takes place at much lower dosages. The results of the mechanical and
   chloride-ion penetration resistance of the final concrete mixture were
   encouraging. Both high compressive strength of 70 MPa and elevated
   modulus of rupture of 12 MPa with a cementitious matrix of very low
   penetration for chloride ions, supported with enhanced microstructure,
   could be obtained. The production of high-performance hybrid
   fiber-reinforced concrete containing high volume ornamental stone dust
   is proved feasible, ecofriendly and sustainable. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this Letter, in situ Mg doping in beta -Ga2O3 was demonstrated via
   metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) epitaxy. The electrical
   insulating property of the Mg acceptors in beta -Ga2O3 was found to be
   intrinsically activated in the as-grown Mg-doped beta -Ga2O3 thin films.
   Growth conditions for MOCVD beta -Ga2O3 were further explored and
   optimized at a lower growth temperature regime, leading to a better
   confinement of the Mg-doping profile. Detailed analysis of Mg diffusion
   characteristics revealed a diffusion barrier energy E-barrier similar to
   0.9eV for Mg in MOCVD beta -Ga2O3, which is likely related to an
   interstitial-assisted process. Surface morphologies and electron
   transport were characterized on samples grown with different growth
   temperatures and Mg doping levels. The MOCVD growth method demonstrated
   its feasibility to grow semi-insulating Mg-doped beta -Ga2O3 epilayers
   with controllable Mg incorporation while maintaining good material
   quality and smooth surface morphology. From capacitance-voltage charge
   profiling, it is verified that the Mg-doped buffer layer grown at the
   substrate-epilayer interface could effectively compensate the charge
   accumulation at the interface. The in situ acceptor doping of Mg in
   MOCVD beta -Ga2O3 will provide versatility for designing beta -Ga2O3
   power devices.}},

Title = {{Cement-based corrugated sheets reinforced with polypropylene fibres
   subjected to a high-performance curing method}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{262}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{This work proposes and evaluates a curing method based on the
   accelerated carbonation (AC) for cement-based corrugated sheets
   reinforced with polypropylene (PP) fibres produced by the Hatschek
   process. These corrugated sheets were experimentally evaluated in order
   to identify how the AC affects the fibre-cement composites. The obtained
   performance was compared with air-cured corrugated sheets reinforced
   with PP fibres and air-cured corrugated sheets reinforced with polyvinyl
   alcohol (PVA) fibres. The AC conferred a high carbonation degree (86\%)
   increasing bulk density (13\%) and decreasing apparent porosity (22\%)
   and water absorption (28\%) by means of calcium carbonate formation. The
   modulus of elasticity (10.7 GPa) and limit of proportionality (8.3 MPa)
   doubled in comparison with air-cured corrugated sheets. The Darcian
   (k(1)) and non-Darcian (k(2)) permeability coefficients were retrieved
   from the Forchheimer's equation. The clogging of the permeable pores
   caused by the AC resulted in a reduction of 49\% and 95\% in k(1) and
   k(2), respectively. The drying shrinkage halved (1 mm/m) by the
   influence of AC which clogged pores with carbonates in the range
   0.06-1.50 mm. Water-tightness test and its evaluation through digital
   image analysis showed a reduced moistened area in the AC cured
   corrugated sheets (22\% lower) and enabled the identification of the
   cracks, which have a great influence on water tightness and
   permeability. The AC mitigated defects and conferred lower permeability
   and higher physical-mechanical performance in comparison to the
   air-cured PP and PVA reinforced corrugated sheets. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) and single amplified genomes (SAGs)
   affiliated with two distinct Methanobacterium lineages were recovered
   from subsurface fracture waters of the Samail Ophiolite, Sultanate of
   Oman. Lineage Type I was abundant in waters with circumneutral pH,
   whereas lineage Type II was abundant in hydrogen rich, hyperalkaline
   waters. Type I encoded proteins to couple hydrogen oxidation to CO2
   reduction, typical of hydrogenotrophic methanogens. Surprisingly, Type
   II, which branched from the Type I lineage, lacked homologs of two key
   oxidative {[}NiFe]-hydrogenases. These functions were presumably
   replaced by formate dehydrogenases that oxidize formate to yield
   reductant and cytoplasmic CO2 via a pathway that was unique among
   characterized Methanobacteria, allowing cells to overcome CO2/oxidant
   limitation in high pH waters. This prediction was supported by
   microcosm-based radiotracer experiments that showed significant
   biological methane generation from formate, but not bicarbonate, in
   waters where the Type II lineage was detected in highest relative
   abundance. Phylogenetic analyses and variability in gene content
   suggested that recent and ongoing diversification of the Type II lineage
   was enabled by gene transfer, loss, and transposition. These data
   indicate that selection imposed by CO2/oxidant availability drove recent
   methanogen diversification into hyperalkaline waters that are heavily
   impacted by serpentinization.}},

Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{The complexation of polymeric materials can be an alternative to
   trapping oil in a physical network for formulating foods with reduced
   saturated fat content. In this research, we have evaluated the use of
   different polymer ratios of Sodium Alginate (ALG), Carrageenan
   predominance iota (CR1) and Carrageenan predominance kappa (CR2)
   complexed with Chitosan (CHI) at a fixed polymer concentration (2\% w/v)
   to formulate complex hydrogels and assess their oil holding capacity.
   The objective was to determine the polymer ratios of CHI to anionic
   polysaccharides (75:25, 50:50, and 25:75), determining the oil retention
   capacity in different ratios, and how this can affect the stability,
   microstructure and rheology of to produce low saturated chocolate with
   trapped canola oil. The stability of the hydrogels was characterized,
   considering the water retention and retention of canola oil in
   polysaccharides complexes. The more stable system was the hydrogel
   CHI:CR2 in a polymer ratio of 25:75. This formulation, when added of
   20\% of canola oil presented an apparent viscosity of 0.631 Pa.s at 300
   s(-1), and its use as replacer of saturated fat allowed the production
   of dark chocolate with 16\% reduction in fat content and 80\% of added
   cocoa butter. Stability studies showed that polysaccharides complexes
   network can retain the edible oil in chocolate formulation for 60 days.
   It has been proven that polysaccharides complexes can be incorporated to
   partially replace the fatty phase in chocolates without considerable
   changes in relevant characteristics as consumer acceptance evaluated by
   sensory tests and rheological properties.}},

Abstract = {{With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, the
   energy consumption of service composition in the IoT environment is a
   key problem to be studied. At present, the problems of service
   composition in the IoT environment mostly focus on the evaluation
   research based on quality of service (QoS), ignoring the overall energy
   consumption in the process of dynamic configuration of service
   composition. Therefore, we construct the service composition structure
   for the IoT and propose the QoS evaluation model and energy evaluation
   model for the service composition in the IoT environment. Considering
   that the service composition in the Internet of things environment is NP
   hard, moth algorithm (MFO) is successfully applied to the QoS evaluation
   model and energy evaluation model. The simulation results reveal that
   MFO has good optimization effect in the abovementioned models, and the
   optimization effect of MFO is improved by 8\% and 6\% compared with the
   genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization, so as to realize the
   green energy strategic management of QoS composition in the environment

Abstract = {{Background Quality assurance (QA) is a process that should be an
   integral part of research to protect the rights and safety of study
   participants and to reduce the likelihood that the results are affected
   by bias in data collection. Most QA plans include processes related to
   study preparation and regulatory compliance, data collection, data
   analysis and publication of study results. However, little detailed
   information is available on the specific procedures associated with QA
   processes to ensure high-quality data in multi-site studies. Methods The
   Global Network for Women's and Children's Health Maternal Newborn Health
   Registy (MNHR) is a prospective population-based registry of pregnancies
   and deliveries that is carried out in 8 international sites. Since its
   inception, QA procedures have been utilized to ensure the quality of the
   data. More recently, a training and certification process was developed
   to ensure that standardized, scientifically accurate clinical
   definitions are used consistently across sites. Staff complete a
   web-based training module that reviews the MNHR study protocol, study
   forms and clinical definitions developed by MNHR investigators and are
   certified through a multiple choice examination prior to initiating
   study activities and every six months thereafter. A standardized
   procedure for supervision and evaluation of field staff is carried out
   to ensure that research activites are conducted according to the
   protocol across all the MNHR sites. Conclusions We developed
   standardized QA processes for training, certification and supervision of
   the MNHR, a multisite research registry. It is expected that these
   activities, together with ongoing QA processes, will help to further
   optimize data quality for this protocol.}},

Abstract = {{A novel ionic liquid/alpha-ZrP (C16MIM/alpha-ZrP) lamellar nanocomposite
   was fabricated via the electrostatic self-assembly deposition technique
   by using exfoliated alpha-ZrP nanosheets and guest molecules
   (1-hexadecyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide) as building blocks under mild
   conditions. C16MIM/alpha-ZrP nanocomposite was characterized by various
   analytical techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy, and synchronous thermal analyzer. The
   net interlayer spacing of alpha-ZrP determined by XRD confirmed that the
   C16MIM cations formed a monolayer arrangement between the alpha-ZrP
   nanosheets. The morphology and microstructure of C16MIM/alpha-ZrP
   composite were observed using SEM and TEM. The C16MIM/alpha-ZrP modified
   glass carbon electrode exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity
   toward the oxidation of nitrite in weak base media. The results obtained
   with differential pulse voltammetry demonstrated that the
   C16MIM/alpha-ZrP hybrid detected nitrite linearly in the concentration
   range from 7.3 mu M to 1.25 mM with the detection limit of 1.26 mu M
   (S/N = 3). Additionally, the prepared sensor showed outstanding
   reproducibility, high stability, and anti-interference capability.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background Primary adherent glioblastoma cell lines are an important
   tool in investigating cellular and molecular tumor biology, as well as
   treatment options for patients.
   Aim The phenotypical and immunocytochemical characterization of primary
   cell lines from glioblastoma specimens during establishment is of great
   importance, in order to reliably identify these cell lines as primary
   glioblastoma cell lines.
   Methods and Results Sixteen primary adherent cell lines out of 34
   glioblastoma samples (47\%) were established and further characterized.
   For phenotypical characterization, morphology and growth characteristics
   of the cells were classified. The cell lines had a high growth rate with
   a doubling time of 2 to 14 days. Morphologically, the cells displayed
   spindle-form or polygonal to amorphous shapes and grow as monolayer or
   in foci without evidence of contact inhibition. The cells were able to
   migrate and to form colonies. For further characterization, the protein
   expression of the astrocyte-specific protein glial fibrillary acidic
   protein (GFAP), the glial marker S100B, the neuronal marker TUBB3, and
   malignancy marker VIM, as well as the progenitor markers NES and SOX2,
   the proliferation marker MKI67, and the fibroblast marker TE7 were
   determined. Based on the immunocytochemical validation criterion of a
   coexpression of GFAP and S100B, 15 out of these 16 cell lines (94\%)
   were defined as primary glioblastoma cell lines (pGCL). All 15 pGCL
   expressed TUBB3 and VIM. NES and SOX2 were stained positively in 13/15
   and 6/15 pGCL. MKI67 was expressed in 11/15 and TE7 in 2/15 pGCL.
   Conclusion These results point out that in self-established primary
   adherent glioblastoma cell lines, the expression of the specific
   astrocytic and glial markers GFAP and S100B and of the malignancy and
   progenitor markers VIM, NES, and SOX2 has to be validated. These data
   show that primary cell lines of glioblastoma origin with high malignant
   potential are reliably to establish using standardized validation
   criteria.}},

Title = {{Early persistence of psychotic-like experiences in a community sample of
   adolescents}},
Journal = {{EARLY INTERVENTION IN PSYCHIATRY}},
Abstract = {{Aims Psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) are common in adolescents. Their
   persistence may confer increased susceptibility to psychotic disorder.
   The early evolution of transient to persistent PLEs is not well known.
   This study aimed to investigate the early persistence of PLEs (over 6-12
   months) in a community sample of adolescents and examine baseline and
   longitudinal associations of early persistent PLEs.
   Methods Five hundred and ninety Year 10 students were administered the
   community assessment of psychic experiences (CAPE) to measure PLEs at
   baseline and at follow up 6-12 months later. Persistent PLEs were
   defined as those present at or above the 90th centile at both time
   points. Independent variables of depression, psychological distress and
   functioning were all measured at both baseline and follow up.
   Self-esteem, personality and suicidality were assessed at follow up.
   Results The study found 5.1\% of participants had early persistent PLEs.
   Persistence was associated positively with depression and distress at
   both time points, neuroticism and openness at baseline and suicidality
   at follow up. Persistence was negatively associated with functioning at
   both time points, agreeableness at baseline and self-esteem at
   follow-up. Only depression remained significantly associated at both
   time points when accounting for other variables. Thus, depressive
   symptoms may account for changes in other domains and be a predictor of
   early PLEs persistence.
   Conclusions These results reinforce the importance of monitoring and
   assessing PLEs in young people especially when associated with
   depression. Further research is required to investigate PLE persistence
   over longer periods with increased measurement intervals.}},

Title = {{Maternal Methyl-Donor Micronutrient Supplementation During Pregnancy
   Promotes Skeletal Muscle Differentiation and Maturity in Newborn and
   Weaning Pigs}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NUTRITION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Adequate maternal methyl-donor micronutrient (MET) intake is an
   important determinant of the organ development and metabolic renovation
   of offspring. The mechanism involved in skeletal myogenesis and the
   effect of MET supplementation during pregnancy on the maternal body
   remain unclear. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the potential
   effect of methyl donor micronutrients (MET) on skeletal muscle
   development and metabolism in offspring using pig models. Forty-three
   Duroc x Erhualian gilts were assigned to two dietary groups during
   gestation: control diet (CON) and CON diet supplemented with MET (folic
   acid, methionine, choline, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12). The results
   showed that maternal MET exposure during pregnancy significantly
   increased the concentrations of protein, triiodothyronine (T3), and
   thyroxine (T4) in colostrum and methyl metabolites, including
   S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH),
   5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), and betaine, in the maternal and
   offspring umbilical vein serum. A similar pattern was demonstrated in
   the body weight gain and myofiber diameters in offspring. In addition,
   maternal MET supplementation significantly increased the concentration
   of offspring serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), T3, and T4;
   upregulated the mRNA expression of IGF-1 and IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1r) and
   the phosphorylation level of protein kinases in offspring longissimus
   dorsi muscle; and upregulated the expression of myogenic genes and fast
   myosin heavy chain (fast MyHC) in offspring skeletal muscle.
   Supplementing sows with higher levels of MET during gestation may
   promote skeletal muscle differentiation and maturity and improve the
   skeletal muscle mass of the piglets.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{As the humanities suffer decline in the academy, some psychologists have
   turned to them as an especially apt way to advance a psychological
   science that reflects lived experience more accurately and robustly.
   Disciplinary psychology's adoption of the ontological and
   epistemological underpinnings of the natural sciences is often seen as a
   misapplication that has resulted in a science that diminishes if not
   demolishes subjectivity and misrepresents many. By contrast, the
   humanities are taken to be well positioned to infuse scientific
   psychology with myriad aspects of lived experience. I applaud all
   efforts to take the humanities seriously, by incorporating the theories,
   methods, and observations of the humanities in psychological science;
   the question is, how best to do this. On what understanding of the
   humanities should scientific psychology proceed? With these questions in
   mind, I review arguments about how psychological science can benefit
   from attention to the humanities. I also consider worries about a
   scientistic turn within the humane disciplines themselves, which turn
   mirrors worries about scientism in psychology. Contemporary examples of
   scholarship on the origins of ancient Greek philosophy and depictions of
   Christ in Renaissance art illustrate how the wars over truth and
   evidence that plague psychology are no less fierce in the humanities. I
   conclude that if psychologists apprehend the humanities with the
   critical understandings called for in psychological science, we may not
   only appreciate their contributions more completely and accurately, but
   may also deploy those contributions more substantially, in working to
   broaden and deepen psychological science.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundAfter the outbreak of Coronavirus in Wuhan, Hubei, in 2019,
   the disease rapidly spread to other parts of China as well as outside of
   China. Since the pandemic outbreak, the general public has been
   responsive to the national call to stay at home in quarantine. However,
   since doubts and anxiety related to the disease have been detected in
   the general public, in this study, we established the WeChat platform
   ``Coronavirus Disease 2019 Voluntary Assistance Group in Sichuan and
   Chongqing regions{''} in January 2020, which was committed to providing
   professional consultation and psychological counseling services for
   residents in Sichuan and Chongqing during the Coronavirus Disease 2019
   outbreak. Our aim was to analyze the consultation practices of residents
   in the WeChat assistance group and provide a reference for the similar
   ``non-contact{''} voluntary service platforms aiming to implement
   consultations during the late pandemic period.MethodsA cross-sectional
   study was conducted using the records containing the consultation
   content from the WeChat assistance groups in Sichuan and Chongqing
   between January 30 and March 1, 2020. Data on consultation content,
   changes in a number of consultation items, answers, knowledge on popular
   science, and expert advice were summarized, and the Pareto chart was
   used to analyze the primary and secondary factors of consultation
   content.ResultsThe constituent ratio of ``respiratory symptoms, masks,
   and disinfection{''} in consultation content ranked as the top three
   factors. Cumulatively, they occupied 49.77\% of the content, thus
   resulting as the primary factors in the consultation content. The number
   of consultation items suddenly increased from 10 on the first day to 116
   on the 7th day, resulting in a 1060\% increased rate. There were 151
   consultation factors, among which 130 (86.1\%) were related to the
   Coronavirus Disease 2019, and 21 (13.9\%) were unrelated to the
   Coronavirus Disease 2019.ConclusionWeChat groups may be used as an
   effective means for providing assistance services for the public during
   the Coronavirus Disease 2019 outbreak.}},

Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Raman analysis has higher sensitivity for the detection of active
   pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) than additives; thus, it is expected
   to be used for the evaluation of low-content preparations. The purpose
   of this study was to clarify the usefulness of granule morphology
   assessment using Raman analysis in the development of low-content
   formulations. In this study, midazolam was used as a model drug to
   prepare granules as a low-content formulation. Raman images were used to
   visualize the distribution of ingredients on the surface of the
   granules, determine the particle size of midazolam bound to the
   granules, and investigate the types of excipient components to which
   midazolam is bound. It was suggested that midazolam particles of a
   certain size were difficult to bind to excipients and had particularly
   low adhesion to mannitol. It was revealed that this phenomenon caused
   the segregation of the content of midazolam particles in the granules.
   Therefore, to obtain granules with good content uniformity, it was
   considered necessary to control the particle size of the API and select
   an additive that does not differ in adhesiveness to the main drug.
   Additionally, the findings obtained by morphological observation could
   be clarified by the quantitative evaluation of additives using Raman.}},

Abstract = {{Objective The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of
   physical reproductions of plaster orthodontic study casts fabricated by
   two different rapid prototyping techniques: Fused Deposition Modeling
   (FDM) and Digital Light Processing (DLP).
   Materials and methods Twenty pairs of pretreatment plaster models were
   prepared from randomly selected patients at the Orthodontic Department,
   University of Damascus Dental School. Twenty-one reference points were
   placed on plaster models, followed by scanning and printing of these
   models using FDM and DLP techniques. Forty measurements were made on
   these models using a digital caliper. Paired t tests were used to detect
   significant differences in the measurements between the 3D printed
   replicas and the original plaster models (Gold Standard). Alpha level
   was adjusted due to the multiplicity of the tests.
   Results The intraclass correlation coefficients for all the comparisons
   made between the 3D replicas and the gold standard models were greater
   than 0.80 with ICCs ranging from 0.802 to 0.990 and from 0.853 to 0.990
   for the FDM and DLP techniques, respectively. This indicated an
   excellent agreement. No statistically significant differences could be
   detected between the 3D-printed models and their corresponding plaster
   models. The overall mean difference was -0.11 mm and 0.00 ranging from
   -0.49 to 0.17 mm and from -0.42 to 0.50 mm, for the FDM and DLP
   techniques, respectively.
   Conclusion The accuracy of the 3D models produced by the DLP and FDM
   techniques was acceptable. However, for the fabrication of clear
   aligners, the optimum fit of the produced plates in the patients' mouths
   is not completely guaranteed.}},

Abstract = {{Organic ferroelectrics, particularly the polymer polyvinylidene fluoride
   and its copolymer polyvinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene, have
   received much attention owing to their low cost, flexibility, and
   convenient thin film fabrication. However, development of this
   outstanding material for electronic applications is significantly
   impeded by its attributes of large coercive electric fields and poor
   spontaneous polarization. While the recent breakthroughs reveal that
   several kinds of molecular ferroelectrics (e.g., diisopropylammonium
   bromide (DIPAB)) can exhibit excellent properties comparable to
   inorganic ferroelectrics, it is still difficult to obtain high-quality
   continuous thin films for ferroelectric devices with high performance.
   In this work, a simple solution strategy is used for the preparation of
   large-area high crystallinity or even single-crystal DIPAB films.
   Subsequently, planar ferroelectric capacitors are developed with large
   in-plane ferroelectric polarization. These capacitors possess excellent
   memory function with small operating voltages (1-3 V), and a record
   remnant polarization of 13 mu C cm(-2) for organic ferroelectric
   devices. The findings have the potential to pave the way for the
   substitution of conventional ferroelectric polymers with DIPAB films for
   future organic ferroelectric devices.}},

Abstract = {{Normal aging is accompanied by escalating systemic inflammation. Yet the
   potential impact of immune homeostasis on neurogenesis and cognitive
   decline during brain aging have not been previously addressed. Here we
   report that natural killer (NK) cells of the innate immune system reside
   in the dentate gyrus neurogenic niche of aged brains in humans and mice.
   In situ expansion of these cells contributes to their abundance, which
   dramatically exceeds that of other immune subsets. Neuroblasts within
   the aged dentate gyrus display a senescence-associated secretory
   phenotype and reinforce NK cell activities and surveillance functions,
   which result in NK cell elimination of aged neuroblasts. Genetic or
   antibody-mediated depletion of NK cells leads to sustained improvements
   in neurogenesis and cognitive function during normal aging. These
   results demonstrate that NK cell accumulation in the aging brain impairs
   neurogenesis, which may serve as a therapeutic target to improve
   cognition in the aged population.
   Jin et al. discover the accumulation of natural killer (NK) cells in the
   aged brains of humans and mice. Neuroblast senescence in the dentate
   gyrus augments NK cell cytotoxicity that impairs neurogenesis and

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{We formulate a theoretical description of antiferromagnetic magnons and
   their transport in terms of an associated pseudospin. The need and
   strength of this formulation emerges from the antiferromagnetic
   eigenmodes being formed from superpositions of spin-up and -down
   magnons, depending on the material anisotropies. Consequently, a
   description analogous to that of spin-1/2 electrons is demonstrated
   while accounting for the bosonic nature of the antiferromagnetic
   eigenmodes. Introducing the concepts of a pseudospin chemical potential
   together with a pseudofield and relating magnon spin to pseudospin
   allows a consistent description of diffusive spin transport in
   antiferromagnetic insulators with any given anisotropies and
   interactions. Employing the formalism developed, we elucidate the
   general features of recent nonlocal spin transport experiments in
   antiferromagnetic insulators hosting magnons with different
   polarizations. The pseudospin formalism developed herein is valid for
   any pair of coupled bosons and is likely to be useful in other systems
   comprising interacting bosonic modes.}},

Abstract = {{Following the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 or coronavirus disease 2019
   (COVID-19), drug discovery and vaccine design to combat this fatal
   infection are critical. In this study, an essential enzyme in the
   SARS-CoV-2 replication machinery, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP),
   is targeted in a virtual screening assay using a set of 1,664
   FDA-approved drugs, including sets of botanical and synthetic
   derivatives. A set of 22 drugs showed a high docking score of >-7.
   Notably, approximately one-third of the top hits were either from
   natural products or biological molecules. The FDA-approved
   phytochemicals were sennosides, digoxin, asiaticoside, glycyrrhizin,
   neohesperidin, taxifolin, quercetin and aloin. These approved natural
   products and phytochemicals are used as general tonics, antioxidants,
   cell protectives, and immune stimulants (nadid, thymopentin,
   asiaticoside, glycyrrhizin) and in other miscellaneous systemic or
   topical applications. A comprehensive analysis was conducted on standard
   precision and extra precision docking, two-step molecular dynamics
   simulations, binding energy calculations and a post dynamics analysis.
   The results reveal that two drugs, docetaxel and neohesperidin, showed
   strong binding profiles with SARS CoV-2 RdRP. These results can be used
   as a primer for further drug discovery studies in the treatment of
   COVID-19. This initiative repurposes safe FDA-approved drugs against
   COVID-19 RdRP, providing a rapid channel for the discovery and
   application of new anti-CoV therapeutics.}},

Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{One-dimensional (1D) graphene superlattices have been predicted to
   exhibit extra zero-energy modes about a decade ago, but an experimental
   proof has remained missing. Motivated by recent experimental progresses,
   here we perform quantum transport simulations for 1D graphene
   superlattices, considering electrostatically simulated potential
   profiles as realistic as possible. Combined with the analysis on the
   corresponding miniband structures, we find that the zero modes generated
   by the 1D superlattice potential can be further cloned to higher
   energies, which are also accessible by tuning the average carrier
   density. Our multiterminal transverse magnetic focusing simulations
   further reveal the modulation-controllable ballistic miniband transport
   for 1D graphene superlattices. A simple idea for creating a perfectly
   symmetric periodic potential is proposed at the end of this work for
   generating perfectly aligned zero modes. Our work provides a reliable
   guide to how the extra zero modes and their copies at higher energies
   feature in transport.}},

   solid oxide fuel cells}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS}},

Abstract = {{In this study, lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite cathodes
   surface-treated with lanthanum strontium cobaltite nanoparticles are
   synthesized using inkjet printing and their performances are evaluated
   using intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells. The porous
   lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite cathode of an anode-support solid
   oxide fuel cell is prepared under optimized inkjet printing conditions.
   The surface treatment is performed by infiltrating a lanthanum strontium
   cobaltite ink followed by calcination. The lanthanum strontium cobalt
   ferrite cathode is evenly surface-covered with lanthanum strontium
   cobaltite nanoparticles, confirming the effectiveness of the inkjet
   printing for the cathode surface modification. The fuel cell
   performances are evaluated in the intermediate temperature range of
   550-650 degrees C. The power is significantly improved even with a small
   addition of the surface lanthanum strontium cobaltite; the enhancement
   factor reaches the value of five. An electrochemical impedance analysis
   confirms that the enhanced fuel cell performance is attributed to the
   reduced polarization impedance, significantly activating the surface
   catalysis. The addition of lanthanum strontium cobaltite retained the
   stability of the lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite cell. However, an
   excessive amount of lanthanum strontium cobaltite significantly reduces
   the cell performance. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Macrophages are re-educated and polarized in response to myocardial
   infarction (MI). The M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype is a known dominator
   of late stage MI. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represent a promising
   tool for cell therapy, particularly heart related diseases. In general,
   MSCs induce alteration of the macrophage subtype from M1 to M2, both in
   vitro and in vivo. We conjectured that hypoxic conditions can promote
   secretome productivity of MSCs. Hypoxia induces TGF-beta 1 expression,
   and TGF-beta 1 mediates M2 macrophage polarization for anti-inflammation
   and angiogenesis in infarcted areas. We hypothesized that macrophages
   undergo advanced M2 polarization after exposure to MSCs in hypoxia.
   Treatment of MSCs derived hypoxic conditioned medium (hypo-CM) promoted
   M2 phenotype and neovascularization through the TGF-beta 1/Smad3
   pathway. In addition, hypo-CM derived from MSCs improved restoration of
   ischemic heart, such as attenuating cell apoptosis and fibrosis, and
   ameliorating microvessel density. Based on our results, we propose a new
   therapeutic method for effective MI treatment using regulation of
   macrophage polarization.}},

Title = {{Can accurate evaluation of the treatment success after radiofrequency
   ablation of liver tumors be achieved by visual inspection alone? Results
   of a blinded assessment with 38 interventional oncologists}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYPERTHERMIA}},

Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Objectives
   To assess the difficulties in the immediate judgment of treatment
   success after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of liver tumors by visual
   inspection alone and to evaluate whether radiologist's expertise affects
   the resultant judgment.
   Methods
   Peri-interventional CT-scans of nine patients with nine hepatocellular
   carcinomas with known outcomes after RFA were presented to 38
   participants from 14 different countries. In a total of 342 reads, all
   interventional oncologists assessed the pre- and immediate
   post-interventional CT-scans through conventional side-by-side
   juxtapositioning of images and judged whether complete ablation (i.e.,
   technical success and technique efficacy) was achieved. Results were
   compared regarding expertise in percutaneous tumor ablation (>50
   interventions performed). An `overcall' was defined as insufficient
   ablation that was misjudged as sufficient, and an `undercall' as an
   erroneous assessment of complete ablation.
   Results
   Overall 3.97 +/- 1.27 out of 9 (44.1\%) cases per radiologist were
   misjudged. The mean number of overcalls and undercalls per radiologist
   were 0.74 +/- 0.50 out of 2 (37.0\%), and 3.24 +/- 1.28 out of 7
   (46.3\%), respectively. 18/38 (47.4\%) participants had considerable
   experience in percutaneous tumor ablation, with such expertise having no
   significant influence on the results (overall: p = 0.70; overcalls: p =
   0.87; undercalls: p = 0.75).
   Conclusions
   Conventional side-by-side evaluation of treatment success after RFA of
   liver tumors by the juxtaposition of pre- and post-interventional
   CT-scans is very difficult for experienced radiologists. The
   implementation of advanced processing techniques such as rigid/non-rigid
   image fusion with the assessment of the periablational margin is thus
   likely needed in order to decrease errors and objectively evaluate
   technical success and predict technique efficacy of liver RFA.}},

   The sample consisted of 855 K-12 students from throughout the United

   negligible levels of DIF and that DIF did not significantly impact
   scores. The results supported the SAED-3 RS, a teacher-completed rating
   scale, as relatively consistent in measuring the emotional and
   behavioral status of school-age students from different racial
   backgrounds. Researchers and practitioners can have confidence that
   scores from the SAED-3 RS are not substantially affected by DIF when

Abstract = {{Increasing renewable carbon incorporation into conventional fuels
   through coprocessing with vacuum gas oil (VGO, a petroleum refining
   feedstock) is a critical step in biofuel development, scaling-up,
   adoption, and associated GHG reduction. Optimization of the coprocessing
   parameters maximizes incorporation of the renewable carbon in the fuel
   products. Quantitative determination of the renewable carbon content in
   the coprocessed products provides direct evaluation of these parameters.
   The coprocessing bio-oil with VGO through hydrocracking (HC) or fluid
   catalytic cracking (FCC) system resulted in carbon isotopic
   fractionation that prevented the direct use of the isotope-mixing model
   for quantifying the renewable carbon. Here, we report an algorithm of
   using a stable carbon isotope approach to quantify the renewable carbon
   content in coprocessing biofuel products through high-precision delta
   C-13 analysis. A controlled experiment carried out by blending a fossil
   diesel (-29.013\%) with a biodiesel (-30.099\%) at various blending
   levels up to 98.0/2.0 wt \% is presented and has demonstrated the
   applicability of this approach. The carbon isotope fractionation factors
   for the bio-oil coprocessing were obtained by using a C-14-derived
   isotope-mixing model. The delta C-13 method was tested by coprocessing
   C-13-labeled biocrude and natural woody biomass-derived fast pyrolysis
   (FP) and catalytic fast pyrolysis (CFP) bio-oils with VGO. The results
   were verified by C-14 accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) method
   (ASTM-D6866) and compared with the yield mass balance method. Strong
   agreement between delta C-13 and C-14 AMS methods demonstrated the
   applicability of the delta C-13 method to quantify renewable carbon
   content in coprocessing fuel products and guide the coprocessing
   optimization.}},

Title = {{Psychosocial job characteristics and mental health: Do associations

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Migrant workers may experience higher burdens of occupational injury and
   illness compared to native-born workers, which may be due to the
   differential exposure to occupational hazards, differential
   vulnerability to exposure-associated health impacts, or both. This study
   aims to assess if the relationships between psychosocial job
   characteristics and mental health vary by migrant status in Australia
   (differential vulnerability). A total of 8969 persons from wave 14
   (2014-2015) of the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia
   Survey were included in the analysis. Psychosocial job characteristics
   included skill discretion, decision authority and job insecurity. Mental
   health was assessed via a Mental Health Inventory-5 score (MHI-5), with
   a higher score indicating better mental health. Migrant status was
   defined by (i) country of birth (COB), (ii) the combination of COB and
   English/Non-English dominant language of COB and (iii) the combination
   of COB and years since arrival in Australia. Data were analysed using
   linear regression, adjusting for gender, age and educational attainment.
   Migrant status was analysed as an effect modifier of the relationships
   between psychosocial job characteristics and mental health. Skill
   discretion and decision authority were positively associated with the
   MHI-5 score while job insecurity was negatively associated with the
   MHI-5 score. We found no statistical evidence of migrant status acting
   as an effect modifier of the psychosocial job characteristic-MHI-5
   relationships. With respect to psychosocial job characteristic-mental
   health relationships, these results suggest that differential exposure
   to job stressors is a more important mechanism than differential
   vulnerability for generating occupational health inequities between
   migrants and native-born workers in Australia.}},

Abstract = {{A simple, rapid, sensitive, and reproducible liquid
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed to
   determine sitagliptin in human plasma. Diphenhydramine HCl was used as
   internal standard (IS). The chromatographic separation was achieved
   using Agilent Poroshell 120 EC-C18 - Fast LC column (100 x 2.1mmID, 2.7)
   fitted with UHPLC Guard Poroshell 120 EC-C18 (5 x 2.1mmID, 2.7 mu m).
   The mobile phase consisted of 0.1\% v/v formic acid and methanol (45:55,
   v/v) run at a flow rate of 0.45 mL/min at 30 degrees C. Methanol
   produced relatively cleaner plasma sample as deproteinization agent.
   Polytetrafluoroethylene mem-brane was preferred over nylon membrane as
   the former produced clear plasma samples. The standard calibration curve
   was linear over the concentration range of 5-500.03 ng/mL. The
   within-run precision was 0.53-7.12\% and accuracy 87.09-105.05\%. The
   between-run precision was 4.74-11.68\% and accuracy 95.02-97.36\%. The
   extended run precision was 3.60-6.88\% and accuracy 93.18-95.82\%. The
   recovery of analyte and IS was consistent. Sitagliptin in plasma was
   stable at benchtop (short term) for 24 h, in autosampler tray for 48 h,
   in instrumentation room for 48 h (post-preparative), after 7 freeze-thaw
   cycles (-20 +/- 10 degrees C), and 62 days in the freezer (-20 +/- 10
   degrees C). Both sitagliptin (analyte) and IS stock solutions were
   stable for 62 days when kept at room temperature (25 +/- 4 degrees C)
   and in chiller (2-8 degrees C). The validated method was successfully
   applied to a bioequivalence study of two sitagliptin formulations
   involving 26 healthy Malaysian volunteers.}},

Abstract = {{Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a multifactorial immunomodulatory
   disorder. In relative nosogenesis, gut microbiota has been the focus of
   research on IBD. In our previous study, we demonstrated the ameliorating
   effect of zeolite-containing mixture (Hydryeast(R), HY) on dextran
   sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, through transcriptomics and
   proteomics. In the present study, we performed further investigation
   from the perspective of metagenomics using the gut microbiota. C57BL6
   mice were provided an AIN-93G basal diet or a 0.8\% HY-containing diet,
   and sterilized tap water for 11 days. Thereafter, colitis was induced by
   providing 1.5\% (w/v) DSS-containing water for 9 days. DNA was extracted
   from the cecal contents and pooled into libraries in a single Illumina
   MiSeq run. The resulting sequences were analyzed using Quantitative
   Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) software. According to the
   alterations in the relative abundance of certain bacteria, and the
   related gene and protein expressions, HY supplementation could improve
   the gut microbiota composition, ameliorate the degree of inflammation,
   inhibit the colonic mucosal microbial growth, and, to some extent,
   promote energy metabolism in the colon compared with the DSS treatment.
   Thus, we believe that HY may be a candidate to prevent and treat IBD.}},

Abstract = {{The Sobrado unit, within the upper part of the Ordenes Complex (NW
   Spain) represents an allochthonous tectonic slice of exhumed high-grade
   metamorphic rocks formed during a complex sequence of orogenic processes
   in the middle to lower crust. In order to constrain those processes,
   U-Pb geochronology and rare-earth element (REE) analyses of accessory
   minerals in migmatitic paragneiss (monazite, zircon) and mylonitic
   amphibolites (titanite) were conducted using laser ablation split stream
   inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LASS-ICP-MS). The youngest
   metamorphic zircon age obtained coincides with a Middle Devonian
   concordia monazite age (similar to 380 Ma) and is interpreted to
   represent the minimum age of the Sobrado high-P granulite facies
   metamorphism that occurred during the early stages of the Variscan
   orogeny. Metamorphic titanite from the mylonitic amphibolites yield a
   Late Devonian age (similar to 365 Ma) and track the progressive
   exhumation of the Sobrado unit. In zircon, cathodoluminescence images
   and REE analyses allow two aliquots with different origins in the
   paragneiss to be distinguished. An Early Ordovician age (similar to 490
   Ma) was obtained for metamorphic zircons, although with a large
   dispersion, related to the evolution of the rock. This age is considered
   to mark the onset of granulite facies metamorphism in the Sobrado unit
   under intermediate-P conditions, and related to intrusive magmatism and
   coeval burial in a magmatic arc setting. A maximum depositional age for
   the Sobrado unit is established in the late Cambrian (similar to 511
   Ma). The zircon dataset also record several inherited populations. The
   youngest cogenetic set of zircons yields crystallization ages of 546 and
   526 Ma which are thought to be related to the peri-Gondwanan magmatic
   arc. The additional presence of inherited zircons older than 1000 Ma is
   interpreted as suggesting a West African Craton provenance.}},

   promotes the reaction with a percentage of hydrogen peroxide production
   (\%H2O2) around 2-4 \%, and an electron transfer number (n) close to 4.
   Tafel plots demonstrates higher mass and specific activities of
   Pd-CeO2-NR/C than Pd/C. Moreover, from cyclic voltammetry tests,
   Pd-CeO2-NR/C shows a higher mass catalytic activity (j(m)= 697 mA
   mg(Pd)(-1)) for the EOR at a more negative onset potential (E-onset=
   0.29 V/RHE) than Pd/C. After Accelerated Degradation Tests (ADT),
   Pd-CeO2-NR/C retains similar to 98 \% of its Electrochemically Active
   Surface Area (ECSA), higher than similar to 51 \% of Pd/C. After ADT,
   the performance of Pd-CeO2-NR/C remains similar for the ORR, while it is
   significantly higher for the EOR, compared to Pd/C. Thus, the addition
   of CeO2-NR enhances the electrocatalytic behavior and stability of Pd
   towards the ORR and the EOR.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose To examine student nurses' attitudes and experiences of door
   policies and restrictive measures in acute psychiatric care.
   Methods A mixed-method study with 274 third-year students.
   Results Participants' attitudes towards door locking and other
   containment measures appeared to be more a matter of custom, practice
   and tradition at particular units. The therapeutic benefits of open
   doors was the central organizing element in open units experiences while
   locked doors appeared to be ``invisible{''} when the locked unit was
   perceived as a caring environment.
   Practical Implications Exploring student nurses' attitudes towards
   crucial and debatable aspects of mental health practice contributes in
   cultivating a critical and analytical attitude towards the service they
   provide necessary for supporting a recovery mental health model and
   building a strong professional identity.}},

Title = {{Properties of cement pastes and mortars containing recycled green glass
   powder}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{262}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{This work deals with the characterization of the properties of mortars
   and cement pastes made with powdered soda lime waste glass. Different
   rates of cement replacement by weight are used: 0\%, 10\%, 25\%, 35\%
   and 60\%. Both fresh and hardened properties are assessed. The influence
   of glass powder on the workability of mortar is determined using flow
   table tests. Chemical shrinkage and hydration heat of early age blended
   cement paste are evaluated using gravimetric methods and isothermal
   calorimetric respectively. The dynamic Young's and shear moduli of
   mortar are evaluated using nondestructive methods. Mechanical
   performances of mortars are measured using flexural and compressive
   strength tests. Pore structures of different mortars are investigated
   with mercury intrusion and water porosity tests.
   Results from this investigation indicate that the amount of cement
   replacement by glass powder plays a critical role in determining mortar
   characteristics. Chemical shrinkage and heat assessment show that high
   glass powder replacement of cement paste increases the hydration
   reaction rate. Compressive strength and dynamic Young's and shear moduli
   values decrease with increasing glass powder content especially for
   mortar made with 60\% glass powder.
   Mortar made with 60\% glass powder has bigger pores due to the dilution
   effect, i.e., the reduction in the amount of hydration product at 7 days
   hydration. Significant compressive strength is gained between 7 and 90
   days for mortar with glass powder, especially with 60\% replacement
   showing pozzolanic reaction taking place during this period. The
   pozzolanic reaction that occurs between glass powder and calcium
   hydroxide (Ca(OH)(2)) to form more calcium silicate hydrate gel (C-S-H)
   leads to the refinement of pores and the reduction of porosity. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{Introduction: Androgen deficiency in relation to the increasing age is
   quite prevalent worldwide. However, diagnosing it in low-income
   countries is quite a challenge due to cost concerns. Through this study,
   we plan to measure the sensitivity and specificity of the Androgen
   Deficiency in Ageing Male (ADAM) questionnaire in the Pakistani
   population.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey study was conducted from September
   2019 to November 2019 in a Pakistani tertiary care hospital. Two hundred
   and fifty-five participants belonging to ages 30-69 years completed the
   ADAM Questionnaire in the out-patient department. Venous blood samples
   were taken to check serum total testosterone levels.
   Results: The ADAM questionnaire revealed 90.12\% sensitivity, 41.3\%
   specificity, 45.34\% positive predictive value, 90.80\% negative
   predictive value, and 61.29\% accuracy in the Pakistani population.
   Conclusion: Low specificity and positive predictive value have been
   shown by the ADAM questionnaire. Hence, it cannot be used as a
   diagnostic tool to detect androgen deficiency, replacing the blood
   sample.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims at proposing a computer vision model for automatic
   recognition of localized spall objects appearing on surfaces of
   reinforced concrete elements. The new model is an integration of image

   supported by principal component analysis and k-means clustering is used
   for identifying the region of interest within an image sample. The
   binary gradient contour, gray level co-occurrence matrix, and color
   channels' statistical measurements are employed to compute the texture
   of the extracted region of interest. Based on the computed texture-based
   features, the logistic regression model trained by the state-of-the-art
   adaptive moment estimation (Adam) is utilized to establish a decision
   boundary that delivers predictions on the status of ``nonlocalized
   spall{''} and ``localized spall.{''} Experimental results demonstrate
   that the newly developed model is able to achieve good detection
   accuracy with classification accuracy rate = 85.32\%, precision = 0.86,
   recall = 0.79, negative predictive value = 0.85, and F1 score = 0.82.

Title = {{Genomic Analysis of Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii
   Isolates Belonging to Major Endemic Clones in South America}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) are emerging
   worldwide. In South America, clinical isolates presenting such a
   phenotype usually do not belong to the globally distributed
   international clone 2 (IC2). The majority of these isolates are also
   resistant to multiple other antimicrobials and are often designated
   extremely drug-resistant (XDR). The aim of this study was to
   characterize the resistance mechanisms presented by 18
   carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii isolates from five different Brazilian
   hospitals. Species identification was determined by rpoB sequencing, and
   antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution.
   Isolates were submitted to whole genome sequencing using Illumina
   platform and genetic similarity was determined by PFGE, MLST, and
   cgMLST. Genome analysis was used to identify intrinsic and acquired
   resistance determinants, including mutations in the AdeRSABC efflux
   system and in outer membrane proteins (OMPs). All isolates were
   identified as A. baumannii and grouped into 4 pulsotypes by PFGE, which
   belonged to clonal complexes (CC) 15(Pas)/103(Ox) (n = 4) and
   79(Pas)/113(Ox) (n = 14), corresponding to IC4 and IC5, respectively.
   High MIC values to carbapenems, broad-spectrum cephalosporins, amikacin,
   and ciprofloxacin were observed in all isolates, while MICs of
   ampicillin/sulbactam, gentamicin, and tigecycline varied among the
   isolates. Minocycline was the most active antimicrobial agent tested.
   Moreover, 12 isolates (66.7\%) were considered resistant to polymyxins.
   Besides intrinsic OXA-51 and ADC variants, all isolates harbored an
   acquired carbapenem-hydrolyzing class D beta-lactamase (CHDL) encoding
   gene, either bla(OXA-)(23) or bla(OXA-)(72). A diversity of
   aminoglycoside modifying enzymes and resistance determinants to other
   antimicrobial classes were found, as well as mutations in gyrA and parC.
   Non-synonymous mutations have also been identified in the AdeRSABC
   efflux system and in most OMPs, but they were considered natural
   polymorphisms. Moreover, resistance to polymyxins among isolates
   belonging to IC5 were associated to non-synonymous mutations in pmrB,
   but no known polymyxin resistance mechanism was identified in isolates
   belonging to IC4. In conclusion, A. baumannii clinical isolates
   belonging to South America's major clones present a myriad of
   antimicrobial resistance determinants. Special attention should be paid
   to natural polymorphisms observed in each clonal lineage, especially
   regarding non-synonymous mutations in constitutive genes associated with
   distinct resistance phenotypes.}},

Abstract = {{Agri-Food producers have a responsibility to provide safe, secure and
   sustainable food in a world characterized by disruption and increasing
   intolerance of waste along supply chains. As such, it is critical that
   they adopt new technologies to ensure efficient and effective management

   underpin process innovation opportunities, there is a gap in
   research-based understanding of how they influence innovation practice
   and outcomes in Agri-Food. In this paper, we investigate how I4.0, as a
   set of enabling technologies, influences core process innovation
   practice and product innovation outcomes in Agri-Food firms. We present
   case studies of two Spanish firms processing fresh food products,
   competing in two important subsectors of the industry, meat and fruit
   and vegetables. We used secondary material and semi-structured
   interviews as data sources. The findings describe how, in the two cases,
   I4.0 has enabled responses to new customers requirements through process
   innovations resulting in enhanced functionality, aesthetics and meaning
   of the delivered products. Our paper contributes a framework identifying
   for researchers and managers how I4.0 technologies act as enablers of

   mol(-1)) and Flynn-Wall-Ozawa methods (50-140 kJ mol(-1)). The
   differential isoconversional method showed that activation energy values
   were in the range of 84-197 kJ mol(-1) for the combustion of berry
   pomace. Isothermal predictions based on the model were indicated at
   temperatures of 560 and 600 degrees C; the reaction had achieved 100\%
   completion (a = 1) after 30 and 6 min, respectively. For the
   nonisothermal prediction, the heating rates of 50, 75, and 100 degrees
   C/min have a two-stage rate profile with a maximum peak in the first
   stage of the reaction. Thereafter, the reaction rate increases once
   again but not to the same effect as the first initial stage. For
   instance, at 100 degrees C/min, stages 1 and 2 are reported as 0.005381
   and 0.005148 s(-1),respectively. Overall, this study demonstrates the
   success of the approach in modeling the thermochemical conversion of
   berry pomace as waste stream biomass.}},

Abstract = {{The entire world stood still when the novel coronavirus struck wrath,
   disrupting the psychological and socioeconomic lives of mankind.
   Coronavirus disease 2019 created a disastrous impact globally, mimicking
   a war-like situation. India witnessed extensive lockdown, aimed at
   limiting the transmission of infection by reducing human contact. This
   uncertain situation sowed fear and anxiety in the minds of the
   population, affecting their mental well-being. People are trying to cope
   with the double whammy of spiking infections and economic instability
   due to halted businesses. This study attempts to capture the prevalent
   stress and anxiety in the general population and to highlight the
   differences in coping with stress and anxiety between the yoga and
   non-yoga practitioners. Rhythmical yogic breathing, Sudarshan kriya
   yoga, has shown several beneficial effects in alleviating anxiety,
   depression, and posttraumatic stress. The observations from this study
   strengthens the evidence that yoga is effective to maintain mental
   well-being even during unusual times.}},

Title = {{Does COVID-19 Impact Less on Post-stroke Aphasia? This Is Not the Case}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has greatly
   affected people's mental health resulting in severe psychological
   consequences. One of the leading causes of long-term disability
   worldwide is aphasia. The language changes experienced by a person with
   aphasia (PWA) often have a sudden and long-lasting negative impact on
   social interaction, quality of life, and emotional wellbeing. The main
   aim of this study was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the
   different psychosocial dimensions which affect PWA. Methods This
   retrospective study included 73 PWA and 81 elderly matched controls. All
   patients were in the chronic phase. They were all discharged from
   rehabilitation services, which left them with different degrees of
   language deficits (i.e., severe vs. mild vs. moderate). All participants
   were administered the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS)
   through an online survey. PWA also took part in the stroke and aphasia
   quality of life scale questionnaire (SAQOL-39). Results Although the
   comparison between two different time points {[}one month before (T0)
   and one month after the lockdown (T1)] led to a significant increase in
   depression and anxiety symptoms in both groups (PWA vs. control), lower
   rates of depression and anxiety were found in PWA compared to the
   healthy group. Significant deterioration was also present in PWA in the
   communication and psychosocial scales of the SAQOL-39 test, which
   correlated with the observed changes in the psychological domains.
   Interestingly, the results were not significantly influenced by the
   degree of aphasia severity. Similarly, in both groups, none of the
   demographic variables (gender, age, and educational level) significantly
   affected the scores in the different subscales. Conclusions This
   evidence which, at first glance, seems to suggest that PWA have been
   partially spared from the impact of COVID-19, actually masks a dramatic
   situation that has always characterized this population. Indeed, given
   that PWA already live in a state of social isolation and emotional
   instability, these conditions might have, paradoxically, limited the
   effects of the coronavirus. However, as our results showed a
   deterioration in the emotional state and communication skills of our
   patients, possible solutions are discussed in order to prevent further
   decline of their cognitive abilities.}},

   panel}},
Journal = {{MECHANICS BASED DESIGN OF STRUCTURES AND MACHINES}},
Abstract = {{In the current report, characteristics of the propagated waves in a
   multi-hybrid nanocomposite (MHC) reinforced doubly curved panel is
   investigated. First-order shear deformable theory (FSDT) is applied to
   formulate the stress-strain relations. The rule of mixture and modified
   Halpin-Tsai model are engaged to provide the effective material constant
   of the composite panel. By employing Hamilton's principle, the governing
   equations of the structure are derived and solved with the aid of an
   analytical method. Afterward, a parametric study is carried out to
   investigate the effects of the (carbon nanotubes') CNTs' weight
   fraction, various MHC patterns, small radius to total thickness ratio,
   and carbon fibers angel on the phase velocity of the MHC reinforced
   panel. The results show that the sensitivity of the phase velocity of
   the MHC panel to the
   and different face sheet patterns can decrease when we consider the core
   of the panel much thicker. Another consequence is that the highest and
   lowest phase velocity in all range of wave numbers could be seen for the
   MHC reinforced doubly carved panel with pattern 3 and 1, respectively.
   It is also observed that as the weight fraction of the CNTs rises, the
   sensitivity of the phase velocity to wavenumber and fibers angle will
   decrease. The useful suggestion of this study is that for designing a
   structure, we should have an attention to the pattern and higher value
   of the wavenumber, simultaneously. The presented study outputs can be
   used in ultrasonic inspection techniques and structural health
   monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Animals communicate using a diversity of signals produced by a wide
   array of physical structures. Determining how a signal is produced
   provides key insights into signal evolution. Here, we examine a complex
   vibratory mating display produced by male Schizocosa floridana wolf
   spiders. This display contains three discrete substrate-borne acoustic
   components (known as ``thumps{''}, ``taps{''}, and ``chirps{''}), each
   of which is anecdotally associated with the movement of a different body
   part (the pedipalps, legs, and abdomen respectively). In order to
   determine the method of production, we employ a combination of
   high-speed video/audio recordings and SEM imaging of possible
   sound-producing structures. Previous work has suggested that the
   ``chirp{''} component is tonal, a signal trait that would be potentially
   unique in the genus. We measured signal tonality for all courtship
   components, as well as for courtship components from sixteen other
   Schizocosa wolf spiders. Our results suggest that S. floridana produces
   courtship song using a combination of shared (palpal stridulation and
   foreleg percussion) and novel (abdominal movement) sound production
   mechanisms. Of particular interest, the ``chirp{''}, which is produced
   using a novel abdominal production mechanism, is the only known tonal
   signal with acoustic properties that are unique within the genus. We
   argue that the potential evolution of a novel sound production mechanism
   has opened up a new axis of signaling trait space in this species, with
   important implications for how this signal is likely to function and
   evolve.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this study was to ascertain the determinants of
   firm performance for Malaysian retailers. Design/methodology/approach An
   online survey was conducted to collect responses from members of the
   Malaysian Retailers' Chain Association. A total of 126 responses were
   obtained. Data analysis was done by using the PLS-SEM method. Findings
   The results of the study indicate that Retail 4.0 adoption is able to
   improve retailers' performance as-a-whole by improving the four
   perspectives of firm performance as given in the Balanced Scorecard,
   i.e. the finance perspective, the customer perspective, the internal
   processes' perspective and also learning and growth perspective.
   Further, enterprise risk management was found to have a positive
   moderating effect on retailers' performance as-a-whole and also on the
   finance and customer perspectives of performance. Research
   limitations/implications The study was conducted only in Malaysia and
   so, it might be geographically limited. Besides, it is cross-sectional
   in nature and therefore, the impact might be different if the study had
   been conducted over a longer period. Practical implications This study
   provides a useful framework for retailers who are seeking to improve
   firm performance. Originality/value This is one of the first studies to
   show the impact of Retail 4.0 adoption on firm performance. Besides,
   this is also the first time, enterprise risk management has been
   introduced as a positive moderator on the impact of technology adoption
   on retailers' performance.}},

Title = {{Dimensions of Musical Creativity}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Current literature on creative cognition has developed rich conceptual
   landscapes dedicated to the analysis of both individual and collective
   forms of creativity. This work has favored the emergence of unifying
   theories on domain-general creative abilities in which the main
   experiential, behavioral, computational, and neural aspects involved in
   everyday creativity are examined and discussed. But while such accounts
   have gained important analytical leverage for describing the overall
   conditions and mechanisms through which creativity emerges and operates,
   they necessarily leave contextual forms of creativity less explored.
   Among the latter, musical practices have recently drawn the attention of
   scholars interested in its creative properties as well as in the
   creative potential of those who engage with them. In the present
   article, we compare previously posed theories of creativity in musical
   and non-musical domains to lay the basis of a conceptual framework that
   mitigates the tension between (i) individual and collective and (ii)
   domain-general and domain-specific perspectives on creativity. In doing
   so, we draw from a range of scholarship in music and enactive cognitive
   science, and propose that creative cognition may be best understood as a
   process of skillful organism-environment adaptation that one cultivates
   endlessly. With its focus on embodiment, plurality, and adaptiveness,
   our account points to a structured unity between living systems and
   their world, disclosing a variety of novel analytical resources for
   research and theory across different dimensions of (musical) creativity.}},

   one-pot cascade that includes the generation of azomethine ylide and
   intramolecular {[}3 + 2]-cycloaddition. Phenotypic screening of the
   developed pilot library enabled the identification of chemical probes
   that efficiently suppress mitochondrial membrane potential, elevate
   reactive oxygen species content, and deplete ATP content in a hepatoma
   cell line (Hepa1-6), without affecting the proliferation of T- or
   B-cells. This selective targeting represents a new approach for the
   treatment of cancer.

Abstract = {{FOLFIRINOX is superior to gemcitabine in patients with pancreatic
   cancer, but this regimen is associated with toxicity and biomarkers for
   response are warranted. MicroRNAs can mediate drug resistance and could
   provide predictive information. Altered expressions of several microRNAs
   including miR-21-5p, miR-10b-5p and miR-34a-5p have been previously
   linked to a worse response to gemcitabine. We investigated the influence
   of expression levels in tumor tissue of those three microRNAs on outcome
   to FOLFIRINOX. Twenty-nine patients with sufficient formalin-fixed
   paraffin-embedded tumor tissue were identified. There was no significant
   association between high and low expression groups for these three
   microRNA. We conclude that polychemotherapy combination can overcome
   intrinsic negative prognostic factors.

   pavements}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{262}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Zero-stress temperature (ZST), defined as an inelastic indicator for the
   behavior of concrete elements in early-age, is one of the critical
   factors affecting the behavior and performance of concrete pavements.
   However, available and reliable methods for selecting this parameter are
   still limited. In this paper, a numerical approach to predict ZST in
   concrete pavement slabs was proposed. A one-dimensional (1D)
   finite-difference method to predict the temperature distribution in a
   hardening concrete slab was developed. To calculate the early-age stress
   in concrete slab subjected to the environmental loads, a two-dimensional
   (2D) finite-element analysis was also developed. The results of the
   temperature prediction obtained from the 1D finite-difference method
   were used and incorporated in the calculating of the early-age concrete
   stress to establish ZST. The results of ZST obtained from the proposed
   numerical model showed a good agreement compared with the field
   experiments. Using the proposed model, the sensitivity analysis of the
   ZST showed that the construction seasons, concrete placement times,
   concrete mix proportions, and pavement thicknesses have significant
   effects on ZST. The proposed numerical model is helpful and useful to
   predict ZST in concrete pavement slabs for given environmental
   conditions, concrete placement time, concrete mixture, and slab
   geometry. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{22}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{We developed switchable Janus particles (JPs) fabricated by coating one
   hemisphere of silica microspheres with a phase-change film. We used the
   chalcogenide GeSbTe (GST), which exhibits a reversible phase change
   between a metal-like crystalline phase (c-GST) and a dielectric-like
   amorphous phase (a-GST). As a driving force for self-propelling the JPs,
   a perpendicular alternating current electric field was applied; the
   frequency dependence of the motion of an individual JP and that of
   inter-JP interaction were investigated. At lower frequencies (2-20kHz),
   a-GST JPs were propelled with their silica side facing forward, which is
   similar to the behavior of Au-silica JPs propelled by the well-known
   induced-charge electrophoresis mechanism, whereas c-GST JPs were
   immobile because they adhered to the indium tin oxide substrate. At
   higher frequencies (50-300kHz), both a-GST and c-GST JPs were propelled
   with their GST side facing forward and a substantial difference in
   inter-JP interaction was observed: repulsive collision for c-GST JPs but
   attractive stacking for a-GST JPs.}},

Title = {{Global adoption of robotic technology into neurosurgical practice and

Journal = {{NEUROSURGICAL REVIEW}},
Abstract = {{Recent technological advancements have led to the development and
   implementation of robotic surgery in several specialties, including
   neurosurgery. Our aim was to carry out a worldwide survey among
   neurosurgeons to assess the adoption of and attitude toward robotic
   technology in the neurosurgical operating room and to identify factors
   associated with use of robotic technology. The online survey was made up
   of nine or ten compulsory questions and was distributed via the European
   Association of the Neurosurgical Societies (EANS) and the Congress of
   Neurological Surgeons (CNS) in February and March 2018. From a total of
   7280 neurosurgeons who were sent the survey, we received 406 answers,
   corresponding to a response rate of 5.6\%, mostly from Europe and North
   America. Overall, 197 neurosurgeons (48.5\%) reported having used
   robotic technology in clinical practice. The highest rates of adoption
   of robotics were observed for Europe (54\%) and North America (51\%).
   Apart from geographical region, only age under 30, female gender, and
   absence of a non-academic setting were significantly associated with
   clinical use of robotics. The Mazor family (32\%) and ROSA (26\%) robots
   were most commonly reported among robot users. Our study provides a
   worldwide overview of neurosurgical adoption of robotic technology.
   Almost half of the surveyed neurosurgeons reported having clinical
   experience with at least one robotic system. Ongoing and future trials
   should aim to clarify superiority or non-inferiority of neurosurgical
   robotic applications and balance these potential benefits with
   considerations on acquisition and maintenance costs.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: hypertension (HTN) among children is reported to be
   increasing due to sedentary lifestyles. In developed countries the
   prevalence of paediatric HTN is recorded to be up to 21\% while the
   magnitude of the same is up to 11\% in Tanzania. This study aimed to
   determine the blood pressure profile and factors associated with
   elevated blood pressure (BP) among children of Mwanza region. Methods: a
   cross sectional study involving 742 children aged 6 to 16 years in
   selected primary schools in Mwanza region was conducted from June to
   August 2019. Data were collected using self-administered structured
   questionnaires where parents helped children to fill in. Blood pressure,
   body weight and height were measured using digital portable
   sphygmomanometer, self-calibrating digital weighing scale and Shorr
   measuring board respectively. Data were analyzed using EpiInfo. Results:
   this study found mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood
   pressure (DBP) were 109.2 +/- 8.1 mmHg and 62.3 +/- 7.2 mmHg
   respectively. Prevalence of elevated BP was 18.1\%. Pre-hypertension
   9.6\%, and hypertension 8.5\%. The age specific elevated BP prevalence
   was significantly higher (OR = 1.9, 95\% CI: 1.2 - 2.9, p = 0.008) among

   prevalence of elevated BP among children of Mwanza region. There was an
   association between elevated BP and increased age, gender, sedentary
   lifestyle and obesity. Importance of measuring paediatric blood pressure
   and health information regarding effects of sedentary life is
   recommended to Tanzanians. Parents should encourage their children to
   have active physical activities. Moreover, health workers should
   implement programmes to modify sedentary lifestyle and prevent children
   from elevated blood pressure.}},

Abstract = {{Although solar irradiation has demonstrated beneficial synergy for
   catalytic CO2 hydrogenation, it has long been debated as to whether the
   observed photo-assisted catalytic enhancement has a photo-activation
   component or is driven solely by the heating effect. Here, we confirm
   that surface adsorbates play a critical role in photo-assisted CO2
   activation. We isolate the rate-determining intermediate species in the
   photo-assisted Sabatier reaction by in situ isotopic spectroscopy.
   Specifically, we reveal that photo-activation of the formate adsorbate
   (HCO2{*}) offers an eightfold photo-enhancement on NiOx/La2O3@TiO2.
   Concurrently, the active La2O3@TiO2 support facilitates the adsorption
   of CO2, which may contribute to the sustained HCO2{*} formation and
   conversion. The findings are crucial as they provide surface
   intermediary insights in the design of catalysts for photo-assisted CO2
   conversion. Ultimately, the understanding may unlock the solar-driven
   hydrogenation catalytic pathway for other reactions involving HCO2{*}
   such as the synthesis of methanol.}},

Title = {{Modelling sustainability efficiency in banking}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCE \& ECONOMICS}},
Abstract = {{We significantly contribute to the empirical literature by investigating
   sustainability efficiency in the banking industry and decompose it into
   internal sustainability and external sustainability in an explicit
   manner. We fill in the gap of the literature by considering internal
   sustainability from two perspectives which are banking stability and
   economic performance. We also extend the current studies by including
   both banks' social contributions (contributions to the society and the
   company development) and environmental responsibility to the estimation
   of external sustainability. Finally, we fill in the gap of the
   literature by estimating the determinants of bank sustainability
   efficiency. The findings from the output distance function and the panel
   vector autoregressive model show that the sustainability efficiency
   level in the Chinese banking industry (2007-2017) ranges from 0.45 to
   0.75 (maximum sustainability efficiency score is 1 and minimum
   sustainability efficiency score is 0). There is a larger difference in
   terms of external sustainability efficiency in the sample, while
   stability is still one of the most serious issues, as reflected by the
   low stability efficiency score compared to other efficiency concepts.
   The results also show that internal sustainability efficiency is
   significantly affected by the firm specific determinants, business
   environment determinants and economic environment determinants.}},

Abstract = {{The pharmacokinetics of fluoroquinolones in chelonians are well
   described but this does not extend to pradofloxacin, a broad-spectrum
   veterinary fluoroquinolone available as an oral suspension for cats and
   dogs. The aim of this study was to investigate the single-dose
   pharmacokinetic profile of pradofloxacin oral suspension at 7.5 mg/kg in
   eastern long-necked turtles (Chelodina longicollis). Eight treated
   turtles were sampled at multiple time points up to 168 hr. Plasma
   concentrations were measured using high-performance liquid
   chromatography. Pradofloxacin was quantifiable for up to 48 hr after
   drug administration. The T-max (9.0 hr) and T-1/2 to 48 hr (13.16 hr)
   were longer, and the C-max (0.2 mu g/ml) and AUC(0-24) (2.2 hr{*}mu
   g/ml) lower, than previously reported in cats and dogs. Pradofloxacin
   was measurable in tank water samples for up to 48 hr. No adverse effects
   were observed in six turtles administered 7.5 mg/kg sid for 7 days.
   Using mammalian MIC data, the AUC(0-24)/MIC ratios for a range of
   bacterial isolates suggest that this dose of pradofloxacin in turtles is
   unlikely to be effective against many bacterial pathogens.}},

Abstract = {{This article places the Labour Party's present post-Corbyn renewal in
   the context of previous periods of renewal in the party's recent

   to rediscover the strategic project of the pluralist soft left as an
   alternative to the programmatic character of the hard left. After
   assessing the Corbynist hegemony established in the Labour Party between
   2015 and 2019, it considers the current absence of any clearly defined
   set of principles or values underpinning `Starmerism'. It then looks
   back to the Kinnockite ascendency in the 1980s, and the Blairite
   ascendency in the 1990s, as possible templates for how the party
   reassesses its positioning with reference to changing electoral, social
   and economic circumstances. A critique of Corbynism's left populism
   culminates in a consideration of the possible grounds for a new
   pluralist agenda attuned to the policy and electoral challenges Labour

Title = {{Social determinants of male partner attendance in women's prevention-of

Abstract = {{BackgroundMale partners are rarely present during PMTCT
   (Prevention-Mother-To-Child-Transmission) services in Sub-Saharan Africa
   (SSA). Male involvement is increasingly recognised as an important
   element of women's access to care. This study aims to identify the
   socio-demographic characteristics, HIV-Knowledge, Attitude and Practice
   (KAP) among women accompanied and not accompanied by their male
   partners.MethodsWe included pregnant women enrolled in PMTCT programme
   between August 2018 and November 2019 in the Southern Region of Malawi.
   Eligible women were aged 18years or older, living with a male partner,
   enrolled for the first time in one of the four selected facilities. We
   provided a KAP survey to women and their partners attending the
   facilities. Our primary objective was to assess and analyse the
   proportion of women who were accompanied by their partner at least once.
   We applied descriptive statistics and logistic regressions to study the
   association between being accompanied and explanatory
   variables.ResultsWe enrolled 128 HIV-positive women: 82 (64.1\%) were
   accompanied by their male partners and 46 (35.9\%) were alone. In the
   multivariable model, women's unemployment and owning a means of
   transport are negatively associated with male attendance (respectively
   adjusted OR 0.32 {[}95\% CI, 0.11-0.82] and 0.23 {[}95\% CI,
   0.07-0.77]), whereas, in the univariable model, high women's level of
   knowledge of HIV is positively associated with male attendance (OR 2.17
   {[}95\% CI, 1.03-4.58]). Level of attitude and practice toward HIV were
   not significantly associated to our study variable.ConclusionsOur study
   shows a high male attendance in Malawi compared to other studies
   performed in SSA. This study highlights that women's level of knowledge
   on HIV and their economic condition (employment and owning a means of
   transport) affects male attendance. Moreover, the study points out that
   gender power relationships and stringent gender norms play a crucial
   role thus they should be considered to enhance male involvement.}},

Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the controversial connection between sentence type
   and illocutionary force. I focus on wh-configurations of the form How
   cool is that! and demonstrate that this recent phenomenon presents some
   interesting challenges to approaches that are concerned with the
   illocutionary potential of sentence forms. In particular, the
   exclamation component of How cool is that! cannot be derived from
   features of exclamative syntax, but rather is a cumulative effect of
   exclamative intonation, the respective adjective, and the degree reading
   of how. However, the V-to-C-movement property results in a special
   pragmatics that proper exclamatives (i.e., without V-to-C movement: How
   cool that is!) lack. I claim that How cool is that! asks for affirmation
   or objection on the part of the addressee, and that this
   addressee-oriented component is signaled by a dedicated class of modal
   particles in the German version(s) of How cool is that! To analyze these
   addressee-oriented exclamations (A-EXCs), I adopt a syntactic approach
   to the connection between sentence types and their potential
   illocutionary uses and thus argue that this connection is by no means
   arbitrary and unrestricted. I show that both the special pragmatic
   function of How cool is that! and the corresponding distribution of
   modal particles in the German counterparts can be accounted for by
   referring to a compositional conception of sentence-type meanings, and I
   hence disagree with recent approaches that deal with How cool is that!
   and its counterparts in German as constructions (i.e., arbitrary
   form-function mappings) only.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by the experimental realization of a multi-channel charge
   Kondo device {[}Iftikhar et al., Nature (London) 526, 233 (2015)], we
   study generic charge and heat transport properties of the charge
   two-channel Kondo model. We present a comprehensive discussion of the
   out-of-equilibrium and time-dependent charge transport, as well as
   thermal transport within linear response theory. The transport
   properties are calculated at, and also in the vicinity of, the exactly
   solvable Emery-Kivelson point, which has the form of a Majorana fermion
   resonant level model. We focus on regimes where our solution gives exact
   results for the physical quantum dot device, and highlight new
   predictions relevant to future experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Cancer is a genetic disease caused by changes in gene expression
   resulting from somatic mutations and epigenetic changes. Although the
   probability of mutations is proportional with cell number and
   replication cycles, large bodied species do not develop cancer more
   frequently than smaller ones. This notion is known as Peto's paradox,
   and assumes stronger tumor suppression in larger animals. One of the
   possible tumor suppressor mechanisms involved could be replicative
   senescence caused by telomere shortening in the absence of telomerase
   activity. We analysed telomerase promoter activity and transcription
   factor binding in mammals to identify the key element of telomerase gene
   inactivation. We found that the GABPA transcription factor plays a key
   role in TERT regulation in somatic cells of small rodents, but its
   binding site is absent in larger beavers. Protein binding and reporter
   gene assays verify different use of this site in different species. The
   presence or absence of the GABPA TF site in TERT promoters of rodents
   correlates with TERT promoter activity; thus it could determine whether
   replicative senescence plays a tumor suppressor role in these species,
   which could be in direct relation with body mass. The GABPA TF binding
   sites that contribute to TERT activity in somatic cells of rodents are
   analogous to those mutated in human tumors, which activate telomerase by
   a non-ALT mechanism.}},

   sensitized ternary composite of MoS3/Au core-Ag shell
   nanoparticles/graphene}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{477}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Herein, the ternary composite consisting of MoS3, Au core-Ag shell
   nanoparticles (Au@AgNP), and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is synthesized
   for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. The various
   characterization studies reveal the co-existence of amorphous MoS3
   nanoflakes and the Au@AgNP with the dual absorptions of surface plasmon
   resonance (SPR) in rGO nanosheets. With the help of single dye
   sensitization, the ternary composite exhibits a better photocatalytic
   activity of 9.6 mmol h(-1) g(-1) with the apparent quantum yield (AQY)
   of 7.8\% and excellent long-term stability under visible light
   illumination. It also shows the wavelengthdependent photocatalytic
   activity under the different monochromatic light radiation.
   Interestingly, the photocatalytic performance of ternary composite
   further enhances when dual dyes are utilized for sensitization. The
   optimized photocatalytic reaction system shows a maximum H-2 production
   rate of 10.6 mmol h(-1)g(-1) with the AQY of 8.6\%. The higher activity
   of ternary photocatalysts is attributed to the amorphous MoS3 nanoflakes
   with the exposed reactive sites over the conductive rGO nanosheets,
   which promotes the electron transfer from photoexcited dyes to MoS3.
   More importantly, the extended SPR absorption of Au@AgNP in-line with
   the maximum absorption of dye molecules improves light-harvesting
   ability and efficiently stimulates the dye excitation.}},

Abstract = {{Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease
   characterized by progressive loss of motor neurons. More than 30 genes

   similar roles in RNA metabolism. This study explored the use of
   high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis to screen for FUS and TARDBP
   mutation hotspot regions in 146 Chinese ALS patients, which achieved
   100\% detection. Two FUS mutations were observed in two different
   familial ALS probands, a missense mutation (p.R521H) and a novel
   splicing mutation (c.1541+1G>A). Five TARDBP mutations were identified
   in six ALS patients, including a novel 3'UTR mutation (c.{*}731A>G) and
   four missense mutations (p.G294V, p.M337V, p.G348V, and p.I383V). We
   found that FUS mutations were present in 1.4\% of Chinese ALS patients,
   whereas TARDBP mutations were responsible for 4.1\% of Chinese ALS
   cases. Here, we describe the accuracy of using highly sensitive HRM
   analysis to identify two novel FUS and TARDBP mutations in Chinese
   sporadic and familial ALS cases. Our study contributes to the further
   understanding of the genetic and phenotypic diversity of ALS.}},

Title = {{Impact of progressive resistance training on CT quantified muscle and
   adipose tissue compartments in pancreatic cancer patients}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Objectives
   Loss of body weight is often seen in pancreatic cancer and also predicts
   poor prognosis. Thus, maintaining muscle mass is an essential treatment
   goal. The primary aim was to investigate whether progressive resistance
   training impacts muscle and adipose tissue compartments. Furthermore,
   the effect of body composition on overall survival (OS) was
   investigated.
   Methods
   In the randomized SUPPORT-study, 65 patients were assigned to 6-month
   resistance training (2x/week) or a usual care control group. As
   secondary endpoint, muscle strength of the upper and lower extremities
   was assessed before and after the intervention period. Routine CT scans
   were assessed on lumbar L3/4 level for quantification of total-fat-area,
   visceral-fat-area, subcutaneous-fat-area, intramuscular-fat-area,
   visceral-to-subcutaneous fat ratio (VFR), muscle-area (MA),
   muscle-density and skeletal-muscle-index (SMI). OS data were retrieved.
   Results
   Of 65 patients, 53 had suitable CT scans at baseline and 28 completed
   the intervention period with suitable CT scans. There were no
   significant effects observed of resistance training on body composition
   (p>0.05; effect sizes omega(2)(p)<0.02). Significant moderate to high
   correlations were found between MA and muscle strength parameters (r =
   0.57-0.85; p<0.001). High VFR at baseline was a predictor of poor OS
   (VFR >= 1.3 vs. < 1.3; median OS 14.6 vs. 45.3 months; p = 0.012). Loss
   of muscle mass was also a predictor of poor OS (loss vs. gain of SMI;
   median OS 24.6 vs. 50.8 months; p = 0.049).
   Conclusion
   There is anabolic potential in patients with resectable pancreatic
   cancer. A progressive resistance training may help patients to maintain
   their muscle mass and avoid muscle depletion. CT-quantified muscle mass
   at the level of L3/4 showed a good correlation to muscle strength.
   Therefore, maintaining muscle mass and muscle strength through
   structured resistance training could help patients to maintain their
   physical functioning. A high VFR at baseline and a high loss of muscle
   mass are predictors of poor OS.}},

Abstract = {{The immunological responses are a key pathological factor in Alzheimer's
   disease (AD). We hypothesized that microglial polarization alters
   microglia-astrocyte immune interactions in AD. M1 and M2 microglia were
   isolated from primary rat microglia and were confirmed to secrete
   pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors, respectively. Primary
   rat astrocytes were co-cultured with M1 or M2 microglial medium. M1
   microglial medium increased astrocyte production of pro-inflammatory
   factors (interleukin {[}IL]-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha and
   IL-6), while M2 microglial medium enhanced astrocyte production of
   anti-inflammatory factors (IL-4 and IL-10). To analyze the crosstalk
   between microglia and astrocytes after microglial polarization
   specifically in AD, we cocultured astrocytes with medium from microglia
   treated with amyloid-beta (A beta) alone or in combination with other
   inflammatory substances. A beta alone and A beta combined with
   lipopolysaccharide/interferon-gamma induced proinflammatory activity in
   M1 microglia and astrocytes, whereas IL-4/IL-beta inhibited A
   beta-induced pro-inflammatory activity. Nuclear factor kappa B p65 was
   upregulated in M1 microglia and pro-inflammatory astrocytes, while Stat6
   was upregulated in M2 microglia and anti-inflammatory astrocytes. These
   results provide direct evidence that microglial polarization governs
   communication between microglia and astrocytes, and that AD debris
   alters this crosstalk.}},

Title = {{No Evidence of Re-infection or Person-to-Person Transmission in Cured
   COVID-19 Patients in Guangzhou, a Retrospective Observational Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE}},

Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: To clarify the clinical characteristics of cured patients
   with coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and to clarify the re-infection and
   person-to-person transmission in the cured.
   Methods: A total of 187 cured COVID-19 patients with antibody test were
   followed up every 2 weeks in this retrospective observational study.
   Assessment for general condition, symptoms, epidemiological contact
   history, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, and antibody tests were
   performed and recorded. Information from Guangzhou CDC was also
   screened.
   Results: There were 33 (17.6\%) patients with negative results for IgG
   and 35 (18.7\%) patients with positive results for IgM. The average days
   of antibody detection from disease onset were 53.0. PCR assay was
   positive in 10 (5.3\%) patients during the follow-up. Neither IgG nor
   IgM results showed a relationship with PCR test results (all P > 0.05).
   Neither re-infection nor person-to-person transmission was found in the
   cured patients. Factors associated with appearance of antibody comprised
   hospitalization days (OR: 1.06, 95\%CI: 1.02-1.11, P = 0.006) and
   antibiotics treatment (OR: 3.50, 95\%CI: 1.40-8.77, P = 0.007).
   Conclusions: In our study, no evidence of person-to-person transmission
   was found in cured COVID-19 patients. There seemed to be no re-infection
   in the cured COVID-19 patients in Guangzhou. These finding suggest that
   the cured do not cause the spread of disease. Additionally, neither IgG
   nor IgM can be used to replace the PCR test in cured patients.}},

Abstract = {{The paper reports an off-axis large focal depth THz imaging system which
   consists of three 3D printed special surface components (two aspherical
   mirrors and an axicon). Firstly, the optical design software is used to
   design and optimize the aspherical parabolic mirror. Secondly, the
   optimized mirror is prepared by a 3D printing and metal cladding method.
   Thirdly, a THz axicon is designed for generation of quasi-Bessel Beam
   and a new geometric theoretical model of oblique incident light for
   axicon is established. Finally, the imaging system based on the special
   surface components is constructed. Its maximum diffraction-free distance
   is about 60 mm, which is 6 times higher than the traditional system. To
   verify the effectiveness, THz two-dimensional imaging experiments and
   three-dimensional computed tomography experiment are carried out. The
   results are consistent with the design and calculations.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Diabetic nephropathy (DN), as the most common microvascular complication
   of diabetes mellitus (DM), has become one of the leading causes of
   end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Numerous studies have indicated that
   podocyte loss plays an important role in the development of DN and can
   even cause proteinuria in the early stage of DN. In the study, we found
   that Huidouba (HDB) significantly decreased the level of fasting blood
   glucose (FBG), the ratio of microalbumin to urine creatine (mAlb/Ucr),
   serum creatine (Scr), (BUN), and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the kidney and
   downregulated the expression of Nox4 predominantly located in glomerular
   tissue while upregulating nephrin and WT1 expression in DN rats. In
   addition, HDB could also reduce podocyte damage and glomerular basement
   membrane (GBM) pathologic changes, as shown by (TEM). In vitro study
   showed that HDB could inhibit high glucose (HG)-induced Reactive Oxygen
   Species (ROS) production and protect against podocyte apoptosis by
   downregulated Nox4 expression in podocytes. These results may provide a
   scientific basis for developing HDB as a potential folk medicine for the
   treatment of DN.}},

Journal = {{FOOD CHEMISTRY}},

Volume = {{331}},

Abstract = {{Four novel organic magnetic ionic liquids were synthesized and
   characterized. A new method of in-situ magnetic ionic liquid dispersive
   liquid-liquid microextraction coupled with HPLC was established to
   simultaneously separate, preconcentrate and determine trace amount of
   sulfonamides in milk samples for the first time. In this work,
   extraction procedure was free of volatile organic solvent. Extraction
   equilibrium was immediately achieved without further operation such as
   vortex shaking. Magnetic separation of two phases was effectively
   achieved by applying external magnetic field without need of
   centrifugation. Furthermore, only a very small amount of inorganic salts
   were generated. This is the first time to realize all these advantages
   in an analytical method. Under the optimal conditions, satisfactory
   enrichment factors, precisions, linear range and low limit of detection
   and quantitation were acquired. The validated method was successfully
   applied in the simultaneous analysis of 5 sulfonamides in real milk
   samples.}},

   initial loads of the 3-p-b and WS specimens were predicted on the basis
   of the curves with +/- 15\% ranges. Furthermore, the initial cracking

Abstract = {{Drought affects plant growth and has become a serious problem worldwide.
   Populus species have different drought tolerance and sensitivity
   abilities. In order to evaluate the mechanism of drought stress
   tolerance in different cultivated Populus species distributed in China,
   the response to drought in the morphology and physiology of three
   poplars clones, NL-895, NL-351 and NL-3412 was investigated. The growth,
   gas exchange capacity, water use efficiency, antioxidant enzyme activity
   and lipid peroxidation were measured in order to evaluate differences
   among different genotypes in responses to two watering regimes (80\% and
   30\% of field capacity). Our results indicated that drought stress had
   serious adverse effects on the seedlings as the biomass, leaf area, nett
   photosynthetic rate (Pn) and chlorophyll content were decreased while
   the activities of antioxidative enzymes were increased and the relative
   electric conductivity and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were enhanced.
   The results showed Populus possessed an effective self-protective
   mechanism to relieve the inhibition of growth induced by water deficit
   through increasing waster use efficiency, adjusting osmotic membrane and
   decreasing plant growth. These findings deepened our understanding of
   drought-tolerance mechanism in Populus.}},

   system (ETS), implemented in 2013, in terms of gross domestic product
   (GDP) and per capita GDP. The methodology drew on a
   difference-in-differences (DID) method using dynamic panel data for 30
   provincial regions. The estimation results show that implementing an ETS
   policy has statistically significant negative effects on economic
   growth. When considering the additional control variables, these effects
   are still statistically significant. Furthermore, these negative impacts
   increase over time with respect to both GDP and per capita GDP. The
   counterfactual tests confirm the robustness of our DID estimation
   results. The specific influence mechanism of China's ETS policy was
   finally discussed. Our findings provide a quantitative decision-making
   support for popularizing ETS policy in China. Based on our DID model,
   empirical investigations of the ETS policy, especially concerning
   economic growth in other regions would produce prolific contributions to
   the literature.}},

Title = {{Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria Alleviate Aluminum Toxicity and
   Ginger Bacterial Wilt in Acidic Continuous Cropping Soil}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Long-term monoculture cropping is usually accompanied by soil
   acidification and microbial community shifts. Soil aluminum ions are
   dissolved under acidic condition (pH < 5.0), and the resulting aluminum
   bioavailability can cause toxic effects in plants. In this study, we
   investigated the bacterial community compositions and aluminum toxicity
   in fields monocultured with ginger for 35 years, 15 years, and 1 year.
   Within these fields are ginger plants without and with ginger bacterial
   wilt disease. The results confirmed that the degree of aluminum toxicity
   in the diseased soil was more severe than that in the healthy soil.
   Continuous cropping can significantly increase the bacterial diversity
   and change the bacterial community composition of ginger rhizosphere
   soil. The relative abundance of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria
   (PGPRs) was increased in the soils used for the continuous cropping of
   ginger. Additionally, aluminum toxicity had a significant positive
   correlation with Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Arthrobacter, and Serratia in
   healthy soils. Based on these results, aluminum stress may stimulate the
   increase of PGPRs (Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Arthrobacter, and Serratia),
   thereby alleviating ginger aluminum toxicity and bacterial wilt in
   extremely acidic soil (pH < 4.5).}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},

Volume = {{477}},

Abstract = {{Ni-rich layered oxides LiNixTM1-xO2 (TM = Co, Mn, Al, x > 0.6) cathode
   materials for lithium-ion batteries have an anisotmpic volume change
   during lithium deintercalation process, which easily causes microcracks
   and rapid capacity decay. In the paper, carbonate precursor prepared by
   a urea-based hydrothermal method is lithiated at different temperatures
   of 750-850 degrees C to obtain agglomerate LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811)
   cathode material with different primary sizes. The sample synthesized at
   750 degrees C shows broadening diffraction peaks due to its near-nano
   grain size, which results in the merging of (006)/(012) and (018)/(110)
   peaks. The effect of anisotropic volume shrinkage is effectively
   weakened by fine grain range, which alleviates formation of
   intergranular crack that is commonly considered as an important reason
   for capacity decay of Ni-rich layered oxide cathode materials. In
   addition, two new types of intragranular micmcracks are first identified
   in cyclic NCM811. One extends along the spinel phase and layered phase
   interface, and the other extends along the vertical (003) (R) crystal
   plane. The difference in atomic plane spacing during the electrochemical
   cycles plays a key role in the growth of intragranular microcracks.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE}},

Abstract = {{Background: Results from studies on the effects of obesity on sudden
   cardiac death (SCD) or ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation
   (VT/VF) in patients with an implantable
   cardioverter-defibrillator/cardiac resynchronization therapy
   defibrillator (ICD/CRT-D) are inconsistent. Our study aimed to explore
   the impact of BMI on VT/VF in patients with an ICD/CRT-D.
   Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the data from the Study of Home
   Monitoring System Safety and Efficacy in Cardiac Implantable Electronic
   Device-implanted Patients in China. Nine hundred and seventy ICD/CRT-D
   patients were enrolled. The outcome was the first occurrence of VT/VF
   requiring appropriate ICD/CRT-D therapy. A general linear model and
   general additive model were used to assess the relationship between BMI
   and VT/VF.
   Results: After a median follow-up of 5.17 years, 352 (36.3\%) patients
   experienced VT/VF requiring appropriate ICD/CRT-D therapy. BMI, whether
   as a continuous variable or a categorical variable classified by various
   BMI classification criteria, had no significant effect on VT/VF
   according to a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model with
   adjustment for potential confounders. However, a non-linear association
   between BMI and VT/VF was identified using a cubic spline function model
   and smooth curve fitting. The inflection point for the curve was found
   at a BMI level of 23 kg/m(2). The hazard ratios (95\% confidence
   intervals) for VT/VF were 1.12 (1.01-1.24) and 0.96 (0.90-1.02) to the
   left and right of the inflection point, respectively.
   Conclusions: BMI is related to VT/VF in a non-linear manner in patients
   with an ICD/CRT-D. Our research suggests a complicated role of BMI in
   VT/VF with different impacts at different ranges.}},

   Activity of SARS-Cov-2}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{We report to use the main protease (M-pro) of SARS-Cov-2 to screen plant
   flavan-3-ols and proanthocyanidins. Twelve compounds, (-)-afzelechin
   (AF), (-)-epiafzelechin (EAF), (+)-catechin (CA), (-)-epicatechin (EC),
   (+)-gallocatechin (GC), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC),
   (+)-catechin-3-O-gallate (CAG), (-)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate (ECG),
   (-)-gallocatechin-3-O-gallate (GCG), (-)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate
   (EGCG), procyanidin A2 (PA2), and procyanidin B2 (PB2), were selected
   for docking simulation. The resulting data predicted that all 12
   metabolites could bind to M-pro. The affinity scores of PA2 and PB2 were
   predicted to be -9.2, followed by ECG, GCG, EGCG, and CAG, -8.3 to -8.7,
   and then six flavan-3-ol aglycones, -7.0 to -7.7. Docking
   characterization predicted that these compounds bound to three or four
   subsites (S1, S1 `, S2, and S4) in the binding pocket of M-pro via
   different spatial ways and various formation of one to four hydrogen
   bonds. In vitro analysis with 10 available compounds showed that CAG,
   ECG, GCG, EGCG, and PB2 inhibited the M-pro activity with an IC50 value,
   2.98 +/- 0.21, 5.21 +/- 0.5, 6.38 +/- 0.5, 7.51 +/- 0.21, and 75.3 +/-
   1.29 mu M, respectively, while CA, EC, EGC, GC, and PA2 did not have
   inhibitory activities. To further substantiate the inhibitory
   activities, extracts prepared from green tea (GT), two muscadine grapes
   (MG), cacao, and dark chocolate (DC), which are rich in CAG, ECG, GAG,
   EGCG, or/and PB2, were used for inhibitory assay. The resulting data
   showed that GT, two MG, cacao, and DC extracts inhibited the M-pro
   activity with an IC50 value, 2.84 +/- 0.25, 29.54 +/- 0.41, 29.93 +/-
   0.83, 153.3 +/- 47.3, and 256.39 +/- 66.3 mu g/ml, respectively. These
   findings indicate that on the one hand, the structural features of
   flavan-3-ols are closely associated with the affinity scores; on the
   other hand, the galloylation and oligomeric types of flavan-3-ols are
   critical in creating the inhibitory activity against the M-pro activity.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Aim: The aim of the present research was to investigate the obstacles,
   which prevent nurses being present with patients.
   Background: It is vital for nurses to be able to spend time with
   patients for an accurate assessment of patients' needs to take place and
   to allow patients to express their concerns. The factors, which prevent
   nurses spending time with patients, are still unclear.
   Method: Data were collected using semi-structured interviews with
   thirty-five participants, including the nurses and physicians from
   educational hospitals of Tehran. The analysis was performed through the
   conventional content analysis. To achieve accuracy and trustworthiness
   of the data, the Lincoln and Guba criteria were used.
   Result: The results of the study can be summarized as: ``conflict
   between human considerations and bureaucratic structure,{''} ``failure
   to meet basic needs,{''} ``the personal and interpersonal aspects of
   caring{''} and ``safety in caring context.{''}
   Conclusion: To ensure high-quality care, it is important to understand
   more fully the factors that prevent nurses spending time with patients.
   Interventions are needed to allow nurses to spend more time with the
   patients.
   Implication for nursing management Health service managers should
   consider that the intrinsic motivation of nurses is to care for
   patients. They can increase the presence of nurses at patients' bedside
   and improve care quality by creating an attractive working environment,
   appreciating nurses' values, paying attention to their opinions and
   establishing professional communication based on mutual respect.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, and multiple
   factors are involved in disease progression. This is why there is an
   urgent need to develop novel molecules with multi-target-directed
   ligands (MTDLs) potential. The current study explores the active
   phytoconstituents from traditionally used medicinal spices, namely
   piperine, cinnamaldehyde, eugenol, cuminaldehyde, and alpha-terpinyl
   acetate for the inhibition of beta-secretase, monoamine oxidase,
   cholinesterase enzymes, anti-aggregation of amyloid beta (A beta)
   fibrils, and their protective effect against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
   and A beta-induced toxicity. Eugenol showed inhibitory activity against
   MAO-B enzyme, free radical scavenging activity, and anti-aggregation
   activity against A beta peptides than other phytoconstituents. It also
   demonstrated a significant cytoprotective effect against H2O2-induced
   oxidative stress and A beta-induced cytotoxicity in pheochromocytoma
   (PC) 12 cells. A molecular docking study of eugenol showed interactions
   with active site residue of the target enzymes. The study successfully
   demonstrated that eugenol could have an MTDLs potential better than
   synthesized drugs used in the treatment of AD.
   Practical applications The present study demonstrated
   multi-target-directed ligand potential of eugenol and can be developed
   to treat complex diseases like Alzheimer's. Eugenol can bind to
   different Alzheimer's targets such as beta-secretase (BACE1), Monoamine
   oxidase B (MAO-B), Cholinesterase's, and amyloid beta(1-42) fibrils and
   might have a disease-modifying potential. The other natural
   phytoconstituents such as piperine, cinnamaldehyde, cuminaldehyde, and
   alpha-terpinyl acetate also demonstrated MTDL potential could also be
   used for developing novel molecules for disease-modifying effect. It
   also protects against oxidative stress.}},

   Teacher-Student Interactions as a Function of Teacher Expectations and
   Student Achievement}},
Journal = {{EDUCATION RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{NOV 29}},
Abstract = {{Through classroom interactions, teachers provide their students with
   different opportunities to learn. Some kinds of interactions elicit more
   learning activities than others. With differential treatment of
   students, teachers may exacerbate or reduce achievement differences in
   their classroom. In addition, differential interactions may contribute
   to teacher expectation effects, with teachers treating their
   high-expectation students more favourably. This study investigated how
   differential teacher-student interactions are related to students'
   mathematics achievement and teachers' expectations. In eight
   fourth-grade classrooms in the Netherlands, interactions between
   teachers and students (N = 152) were observed in maths lessons. Data
   regarding teachers' expectations about their students and mathematics
   achievement tests scores were collected. Analyses indicated that there
   were relations between teacher expectations and teachers' classroom
   interactions. Teachers gave more direct turns and more directive
   feedback to their low-expectation students, who were also the students
   who performed low in maths. After controlling for actual achievement, it
   appeared that students for whom the expectations were lower than could
   be expected based on their performance received more direct turns and
   directive task-related feedback. These results point to the existence of
   teacher expectation effects.}},

Abstract = {{Gentiana is a sub-cosmopolitan temperate genus among the most
   species-rich in Gentianaceae. Although molecular data (produced via
   Sanger sequencing) allowed the resolution of phylogenetic relationships
   between Gentiana and other genera in subtribe Gentianinae, the validity
   of sections within the genus remains largely untested. In this study, we
   evaluated the monophyly of all 14 sections attributed to Gentiana, using
   294 unlinked anchored loci, the nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) cistron as
   well as plastid genomes, all produced by anchored hybrid enrichment. We
   reconstructed phylogenetic relationships by conducting maximum
   likelihood and Bayesian analyses. These analyses represent a significant
   improvement over previous taxonomic studies using molecular tools. Our
   results partly correspond to traditional taxonomic treatments, with
   several sections being well supported as monophyletic, including
   Gentiana sect. Calathianae, sect. Ciminalis, sect. Cruciata, sect.
   Frigida, sect. Gentiana and sect. Pneumonanthe. In contrast, G. sect.
   Isomeria, sect. Microsperma and sect. Monopodiae were found to be
   polyphyletic, whereas sect. Dolichocarpa and sect. Fimbricorona were
   nested within sect. Chondrophyllae. We here provide new taxonomic
   treatments for these sections, mostly based upon the traditional
   delineation of their series, which were recovered as monophyletic. In
   our new treatment, Gentiana encompasses 13 sections. A new determination
   key to the sections of Gentiana is provided.}},

   Neoplasms}},
Journal = {{CUREUS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 29}},
Abstract = {{Introduction
   Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are a heterogeneous group of tumors with
   histological features varying from well-differentiated neuroendocrine
   tumors (WDNETs) to poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas
   (PDNECs). In this study, we investigated the clinicomorphological
   spectrum of NENs including tumor grade, site of origin, and metastasis.
   Methods
   We retrospectively studied 125 cases of NENs (at the Department of
   Histopathology, Liaquat National Hospital and Medical College, Karachi)
   between the years 2014 and 2020. Slides of these cases were retrieved
   from the departmental archives and were evaluated for the tumor type,
   grade, and site of origin.
   Results
   The mean age of the patients was 51.25 +/- 16.10 years. Overall, the
   liver was the most common site of the tumor (27.2\%), followed by the
   small bowel (15.2\%). Grade 2 was the most common tumor grade (40.8\%),
   and most of the tumors were primary (68.8\%). A total of 84.8\% of the
   tumors were WDNETs/carcinoids, while 15.2\% were PDNEC. The small bowel
   was the most common site of primary NENs, followed by the stomach and
   lung. Among primary neuroendocrine tumors, patients with PDNEC were
   significantly noted to have a higher mean age than WDNET/carcinoid.
   Similarly, PDNEC had a higher ki67 index than WDNET/carcinoid. For
   metastatic NENs, the liver was the most common site of metastasis
   (71.8\%) with the GI/pancreatobiliary tract being the most common
   primary site of origin (51.3\%). Tumors with primary lung origin were
   found to have a higher tumor grade than primary GI/pancreatobiliary
   tract origin NENs (p<0.0001).
   Conclusion
   In this study, we found that the small intestine and liver were the most
   common sites for primary and metastatic NENs, respectively. Moreover,
   primary PDNECs were associated with a higher mean age than WDNETs.
   Alternatively, metastatic NENs with primary lung origin had a higher
   tumor grade than primary GI/pancreatobiliary tract origin.}},

Journal = {{CLINICAL TRANSPLANTATION}},
Year = {{2021}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background Liver transplant recipients have an increased incidence of
   malignancies, but it is unclear whether they have a higher risk of
   colorectal cancer.
   Aim To investigate whether liver transplant recipients have an increased
   risk of developing colorectal adenomas (a surrogate marker of colorectal
   cancer risk).
   Patients and methods One hundred thirty-nine liver transplant recipients
   (excluding primary sclerosing cholangitis) who underwent a colonoscopy
   and polypectomy before and after transplantation, and 367
   nontransplanted patients who underwent a colonoscopy for colorectal
   cancer screening and a second colonoscopy later were retrospectively
   studied. The risks of incident colorectal adenomas and high-risk
   adenomas (advanced or multiple adenomas or carcinomas) were compared
   between both cohorts.
   Results Incident colorectal adenomas were found in 40.3\% of the
   transplanted patients and 30.0\% of the nontransplanted patients (15.1\%
   and 5.5\%, respectively, had high-risk adenomas). After adjusting for
   age, sex, presence of adenomas in the baseline endoscopy, and interval
   between colonoscopies, transplant recipients showed a higher risk of
   developing colorectal adenomas (OR: 1.61; 95\% CI: 1.05-2.47; p = .03)
   and high-risk adenomas (OR: 2.87; 95\% CI: 1.46-5.65; p = .002).
   Conclusions Our results suggest that liver transplant recipients have an
   increased risk of developing colorectal adenomas and lesions with high
   risk of colorectal cancer.}},

Month = {{NOV 29}},
Abstract = {{A long-span sports centre generally comprises multiple stadiums and
   gymnasiums, for which mutual interference effects of wind-induced snow
   motion are not explicitly included in the specifications of various
   countries. This problem is addressed herein by performing wind tunnel
   tests and numerical simulations to investigate the snow distribution and
   mutual interference effect on the roofs of long-span stadiums and
   gymnasiums. The wind tunnel tests were used to analyse the influences of
   the opening direction (0 degrees, 90 degrees, 180 degrees, and 270
   degrees) and spacing (0.3 L, 0.5 L, 1 L, 1.5 L, 2 L, and 2.5 L, where L
   is the gymnasium span) of the stadium and gymnasium. The wind tunnel
   tests and numerical simulations were used to analyse the influence of
   the wind direction angle (from 0 degrees to 315 degrees, there are a
   total of eight groups in 45 degrees intervals). The following results
   were obtained. The stadium opening had a significant effect on the snow
   distribution on the surface of the two structures. An even snow
   distribution was obtained when the stadium opened directly facing the
   gymnasium, which corresponded to the safest condition for the
   structures' surfaces. As the spacing between the buildings increased,
   the interference effect between the two structures was reduced. The
   interference was negligible for a spacing of 2 L. The stadium had the
   most significant amplification interference effect on the gymnasium for
   a wind direction angle of 45 degrees, which was extremely unfavourable
   to the safety of the structure. The most favourable wind direction angle
   was 270 degrees, where there were both amplification interference and
   blockage interference.}},

Title = {{Foliar application of magnesium mitigates soil acidity stress in wheat}},

Abstract = {{Soil acidity is one of the most important soil constraints for wheat
   growth, and magnesium (Mg) can play a critical role in mitigating the
   adverse effects of soil acidity on plants. There is, however, limited
   information available about the influence of Mg nutrition, especially
   foliar application, on wheat (Triticum aestivum) growth in acidic soil.
   In a series of glasshouse experiments, Al-sensitive wheat genotype (ES8)
   was grown to vegetative stage (Zadoks 23) with or without foliar Mg
   application at different rates (0, 50, 200 and 1,000 mg Mg/L), and
   acidic soil was used as the growth medium with or without lime and Mg
   amendment. The effects of these treatments on plant growth,
   physiological responses, tissue concentration of Mg, dry biomass
   accumulation and root length were characterized. Magnesium application
   to foliage significantly increased (by around 14\%) both shoot and root
   dry biomass compared to the control (0 foliar Mg). No significant
   variation was observed in response to different Mg salts (sulphate or
   chloride) applied to either soil or foliage in relation to wheat growth
   and physiological responses. Other than liming, foliar Mg application
   (200 mg Mg/L) coupled with Mg application to soil (20 mg/kg soil)
   provided optimum conditions for wheat growth in an acid soil. Leaf
   extension rate, chlorophyll content and root length of wheat treated
   with 200 mg Mg/L foliar application were increased significantly (by
   12\%, 10\% and 23\%, respectively) in comparison to plants treated with
   0 foliar Mg. Physiological parameters such as net photosynthetic rate,
   transpiration rate and stomatal conductance were 4-fold higher in foliar
   Mg-treated plants compared with those receiving no foliar Mg. Therefore,
   applying 200 mg Mg/L to the foliage may assist in minimizing the
   negative impact of soil acidity on wheat growth.}},

Title = {{Artificial neural network-based prediction of prolonged length of stay

   undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION}},
Year = {{2021}},

Abstract = {{Background Prolonged length of stay (LOS) and post-acute care after
   percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is common and costly. Risk
   models for predicting prolonged LOS and post-acute care have limited
   accuracy. Our goal was to develop and validate models using artificial
   neural networks (ANN) to predict prolonged LOS > 7days and need for
   post-acute care after PCI.
   Methods We defined prolonged LOS as >= 7 days and post-acute care as
   patients discharged to: extended care, transitional care unit,
   rehabilitation, other acute care hospital, nursing home or hospice care.
   Data from 22 675 patients who presented with ACS and underwent PCI was
   shuffled and split into a derivation set (75\% of dataset) and a
   validation dataset (25\% of dataset). Calibration plots were used to
   examine the overall predictive performance of the MLP by plotting
   observed and expected risk deciles and fitting a lowess smoother to the
   data. Classification accuracy was assessed by a receiver-operating
   characteristic (ROC) and area under the ROC curve (AUC).
   Results Our MLP-based model predicted prolonged LOS with an accuracy of
   90.87\% and 88.36\% in training and test sets, respectively. The
   post-acute care model had an accuracy of 90.22\% and 86.31\% in training
   and test sets, respectively. This accuracy was achieved with quick
   convergence. Predicted probabilities from the MLP models showed good
   (prolonged LOS) to excellent calibration (post-acute care).
   Conclusions Our ANN-based models accurately predicted LOS and need for
   post-acute care. Larger studies for replicability and longitudinal
   studies for evidence of impact are needed to establish these models in
   current PCI practice.}},

Volume = {{179}},

Pages = {{19-42}},

Abstract = {{Some 60 years ago, six researchers obtained a semi-empirical equation
   that describes how the stability correction function for the mean
   velocity profile (phi(m)) in the atmospheric surface layer varies with
   the stability parameter-the famous O'KEYPS equation. Their derivations
   are essentially based on interpolation of the turbulent eddy viscosity
   between neutral and convective conditions. Comparing the O'KEYPS
   equation with new theoretical developments-such as phenomenological and
   cospectral budget models-suggests that Heisenberg's eddy viscosity
   provides a unifying framework for interpreting the behaviour of phi(m).
   The empirical coefficient in the O'KEYPS equation, which is on the order
   of 10 based on data fitting to observations, is found to be primarily
   linked to the increase of the size of turbulent eddies as instability
   increases. The ratio of the sizes of turbulent eddies under convective
   and neutral conditions is on the order of 1/kappa, where kappa is the
   von Karman constant, and is modulated by the turbulent Prandtl number.}},

Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{86}},

Pages = {{78-85}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the relationship between ionic strength and protein
   solubility is essential to the utilization of salt in the formulation
   design of plant protein-based food and beverage products. In this study,
   suspensions of oat protein isolate (OPI) were treated with two kinds of
   common salts (sodium chloride NaCl; sodium phosphate NaP) at different
   ionic strengths (I). Electrical conductivity, protein solubility,
   particle size, and protein profile (sodium dodecyl
   sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) were analyzed. The results
   showed the highest protein solubility at extremely low I (< 0.005 for
   NaCl; < 0.012 for NaP) and a minimum solubility at I 0.03 to 0.2
   depending on the type of salt. Particle size and electrophoretic
   patterns supported the solubility profile. The combination effect of
   ionic strength and pH was also investigated. A characteristic U-shaped
   solubility curve observed within pH 2.0 to 8.0 at low ionic strengths (I
   < 0.01) was altered by increasing the salt concentration. The findings
   demonstrate that ionic strength and ion species play a crucial role in
   oat protein solubility, and the ionic effect can be modified by changing
   the pH. Therefore, the application of appropriate salt concentrations is
   vitally important to the manufacture of oat protein-based food products.
   Practical Application Sodium chloride and phosphate are two of the most
   widely utilized salts in food processing. This study highlights the
   relationship between ionic strength of the two salts and oat protein
   solubility at different pH levels, providing useful information for
   selecting proper salt concentrations in the manufacture of oat
   protein-based food products.}},

Journal = {{SN APPLIED SCIENCES}},

Number = {{12}},
Month = {{NOV 29}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this work is to provide a formulation of a non-linear
   diffusion model in the form of a Porous Medium Equation (PME) with
   application to a fire extinguishing process in an aircraft engine
   nacelle. The work starts by describing some relevant publications
   currently related to fire suppression modelling methods with emphasis in
   the aerospace sector. The PME is then introduced highlighting some key
   relevant features ( particularly the finite speed of propagation)
   compared to the classical Heat Equation (HE). We will refer as u to the
   extinguisher or suppressor concentration in the media, which is
   postulated to be governed by a PME equation of the form:
   u(t) = Delta u(m) + vertical bar x vertical bar(sigma) u(p), (1)
   u(x, 0) = u(0)(x) is an element of L-loc(infinity)(R-N), (2)
   where
   m > 1, sigma > 0, p < 1, (3)
   (x, t) is an element of Q(T) = R-N x (0, T) (4)
   Without losing generality and in virtue of the mass transfer
   application, we will consider that any solution is u >= 0. The set of
   equation and conditions expressed from (1) to (4) will be referred as
   problem P. From a mathematical perspective, the main areas of analysis
   are related to the existence of solutions, the obtaining of particular
   solutions as asymptotic approach and the application or
   particularization to a representative aircraft engine nacelle domain
   where a fire may happen.}},

Title = {{Multicomponent gas transport in a Stefan diffusion column containing an
   azeotropic liquid mixture of acetone-n-hexane}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING COMMUNICATIONS}},
Abstract = {{The Stefan column was designed in the 19(th) Century to estimate binary
   gas diffusivities by placing a pure volatile liquid at the bottom
   overlaid with a stagnant gas. A steady gas sweep at the top removed the
   diffused species. Previous validation, by other research groups, of the
   Maxwell-Stefan multicomponent mass transport equations in the Stefan
   column prompted a study to test an azeotropic binary liquid as the
   source of both gaseous species, maintaining the composition at the
   liquid-gas interface constant. Azeotropic acetone (A)-n-hexane (B)
   mixtures were placed in a vertical glass pipette in preparation for an
   isothermal evaporation-diffusion experiment in atmospheric air (C). The
   pure solvents were also tested separately. The experimental interfacial
   descent, the solvents' diffusivities in air, and their molar fluxes were
   provided as input to the Maxwell-Stefan equations to obtain the binary
   gas diffusivity D-AB,D-exp, which is unavailable in the literature. The
   pure solvent diffusivities in air showed good agreement with the
   Chapman-Enskog kinetic theory for low-density gases, but the
   experimental gas diffusivity of acetone in n-hexane exceeded
   consistently the theoretical predictions by at least two orders of
   magnitude. A possible explanation for this unexpected result is the high
   affinity between the solvent molecules in the liquid state, which
   undoubtedly affects their gas transport behavior. Further studies are
   necessary to elucidate this finding. This is the first attempt to use a
   liquid azeotrope in a Stefan column. By combining this approach with the
   Maxwell-Stefan transport equations, the gas diffusivity of acetone in
   n-hexane was obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Key-policy attribute-based encryption (KP-ABE) is the cryptographic
   primitive which enables fine grained access control while still
   providing end-to-end encryption. Although traditional encryption schemes
   can provide end-to-end encryption, users have to either share the same
   decryption keys or the data have to be stored in multiple instances
   which are encrypted with different keys. Both of these options are
   undesirable. However, KP-ABE can provide less key overhead compared to
   the traditional encryption schemes. While there are a lot of KP-ABE
   schemes, none of them simultaneously supports multiuse of attributes,
   adaptive security, monotone span programs, and static security
   assumption. Hence, we propose a fully secure KP-ABE scheme for monotone
   span programs in prime-order group. This scheme uses selective security
   proof techniques to obtain the requisite ingredients for full security
   proof. This strengthens the correlation between selective and full
   security models and enables the transition of the best qualities in
   selective security models to fully secure systems. The security proof is
   based on decisional linear assumption and three-party Diffie-Hellman
   assumption.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To optimize the allocation of nursing resources, we
   investigate an alternative strategy for indwelling catheter cleaning.
   Methods. The present study involved a total of 117 male patients and 54
   female patients, who were catheterized after urinary surgery from Aug
   2018 to Feb 2019. The samples of indwelling catheter cleaning solutions
   were divided by two parts for microbiological culture and microbiome
   analysis. Results. No pathogenic bacteria were observed in the
   microbiological culture of the indwelling catheter cleaning samples from
   24 h-uncleaned group and 48 h-uncleaned group. The microbiome analysis
   also showed no significant difference in bacterial diversity and
   quantity of the indwelling catheter cleaning solutions between the two
   groups. Conclusion. The indwelling catheter cleaning for male after
   urinary surgery can be prolonged to 48 h. The result of this study
   provided reliable basis for optimizing the allocation of clinical
   nursing resources.}},

Abstract = {{Background Trial of Rivaroxaban in AntiPhospholipid Syndrome was a
   prospective randomized, open-label, noninferiority study conducted in 14
   centers in Italy. Rivaroxaban was compared with warfarin for the
   prevention of thromboembolic events, major bleeding, and vascular death
   in high-risk, triple-positive patients with antiphospholipid syndrome.
   Objective The aim of this paper is to report the events during the
   2-year follow-up after the study closure.
   Methods On January 28, 2018, the trial was prematurely stopped by
   adjudication and safety committee for an excess of events in the
   rivaroxaban group. Randomized patients were advised on trial results and
   those randomized to rivaroxaban were solicited to switch to warfarin.
   All 14 participating centers were asked and accepted to follow their
   patients for clinical events. This report describes the rate of events
   that occurred between January 28, 2018, and January 28, 2020.
   Results Of 120 randomized patients, 115 were available for follow-up.
   Outcome events were two in six (33.3\%) patients who remained on direct
   oral anticoagulants (DOACs) and six in 109 (5.7\%) patients on warfarin
   (hazard ratio {[}HR] 6.9; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 1.4-34.5, P =
   .018). The two patients on DOACs (one taking dabigatran and one taking
   rivaroxaban) suffered from thromboembolic events, whereas of the six
   patients with composite outcomes on warfarin, three had thromboembolic
   events (HR for thrombosis 13.3; 95\% CI 2.2-79.9, P = .005).
   Conclusion These data further support the use of warfarin in high-risk
   patients with antiphospholipid syndrome.}},

Abstract = {{Kelps can be included in integrated multitrophic aquaculture (IMTA)
   where their growth and quality might benefit from the nutrient load
   released by other species like finfish and mussels transforming
   effluents from the cultured animals into valuable products. We studied
   how different nutrient concentrations affect growth, photosynthesis,
   chemical composition and pigment content of the kelp Saccharina
   latissima. We exposed kelps to natural seawater, water enriched to
   levels of ammonium and nitrate simulating finfish cage waste (IMTA1) and
   a combination of such enrichment with natural effluents coming from
   mussels (IMTA2). The algal biomass was higher and produced elevated
   total organic content when exposed to both IMTA1 and IMTA2. The
   photosynthetic responses in terms of relative electron transfer rate
   (rETR(max)), PSII saturation irradiance (E-k) and total nitrogen content
   were also positively affected by both IMTA1 and IMTA2. We found a
   significant enhancement in pigment content only when algae were exposed
   to the strongest enrichment of our study (IMTA2). Finally, we found a
   positive relationship between rETR(max) and growth, and the content of
   chlorophyll a and fucoxanthin. Our results show significant
   physiological responses of S. latissima to nutrient enrichment mimicking
   IMTA settings, as well as the benefit of added nutrients through a boost
   in photosynthetic activity that leads to higher kelp biomass and pigment
   production. This study suggests that modest nitrogen enrichment such as
   the one in our IMTA2 setup is enough to generate not only higher kelp
   biomass, but also an increased biomass quality with potentially higher
   market value.}},

Abstract = {{Background: To improve bovine transrectal palpation (TRP) and pregnancy
   diagnosis (PD) training, the effect of a high-intensity one-week
   training programme for veterinary elective students (N=59) with an
   interest in production animal practice was evaluated.
   Methods: Training consisted of exposure to rectal examination
   simulators, abattoir organs, theory materials and live cow PDs
   supervised by experienced large animal practitioners. Palpation skills
   were assessed before and after training using a validated TRP Objective
   Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) in non-pregnant cows. Each
   student then performed PDs (n=12) on cows of known pregnancy status.
   Students' PD accuracy was measured as sensitivity and specificity, being
   respectively defined as the proportion of pregnant and non-pregnant cows
   correctly identified.
   Results: Students' scores improved from the first to the second OSCE
   (P=0.03), mostly as a result of improved ability to identify uterine
   symmetry/asymmetry and the presence/absence of a corpus luteum on the
   right ovary (P<0.01 and P=0.03, respectively). Overall student
   sensitivity and specificity of PD were 89.1 per cent (95 per cent CI
   78.1-92.2 per cent) and 67.7 per cent (95 per cent CI 60.1-74.5 per
   cent), respectively.
   Conclusion: This prospective cohort study describes a strategy to
   improve students' TRP skills with the potential to reduce training time
   and animal use at teaching institutions by outsourcing student training
   to private practitioners.}},

Abstract = {{Amino acid stereoconfiguration has been shown to play a key role in the

   to a dipeptide, the overall differences between isomers are less marked,
   with both homo- and hetero-chiral dipeptides forming gels, although with
   different stability over time. The soft materials are studied by a
   number of spectroscopic and microcopic techniques, and single-crystal

Abstract = {{Background Echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular (LV) size
   and function using area-based indices and volumetric estimates is not
   well established in horses.
   Objective To report reference intervals and measurement variability for
   uni-, 2-, and 3-dimensional echocardiographic indices of LV size and
   systolic function in Warmblood horses and to provide proof of concept
   for allometric scaling of variables to body weight. Unidimensional
   indices were to be compared to area-based indices and LV volume
   estimates to establish their clinical use.
   Animals Thirty healthy Warmblood horses and 70 Warmblood horses with a
   primary diagnosis of mitral regurgitation or aortic regurgitation.
   Methods Echocardiographic indices of LV size and systolic function were
   measured using an existing echocardiography database. Weight-related
   variables were scaled to body weight (BWT). Reference intervals and
   measurement variability were calculated, the influence of valvular
   regurgitation on LV size and function was investigated and agreement
   between different variables for detection of reduced, normal, and
   increased LV size and systolic function was assessed.
   Results Reference values for healthy Warmblood horses were reported.
   Measurement variability was sufficiently low for clinical use of all
   variables. Allometric scaling was effective to correct diastolic LV
   dimensions and cardiac output for differences in BWT. Various
   echocardiographic indices resulted in different conclusions regarding
   identification of LV enlargement and systolic dysfunction in healthy
   horses and horses with valvular regurgitation.
   Conclusions and Clinical Importance Echocardiographic assessment of LV
   size and systolic function should include joint assessment of multiple
   uni- and multidimensional indices. Area-based or volumetric indices that
   reflect LV long-axis motion should be included.}},

Abstract = {{Aims and objectives To explore how people self-manage their long-term
   conditions and the support enabling them to do so.
   Background People with long-term conditions are required to engage in
   daily self-management with the support of health practitioners, family
   and friends.
   Design A qualitative interview study.
   Methods Thirty-two New Zealand European and Pacific people with
   long-term conditions were interviewed about how they manage their
   condition/s at home with support from family, neighbours, agencies and
   general practice doctors and nurses. Interviews were recorded,
   transcribed, checked and analysed for thematic content. The COREQ
   checklist was used.
   Results Three themes emerging from the data were as follows:
   `acceptance' of conditions, limitations, support and advice; `making it
   work' regarding life with long-term conditions; and the need for health
   practitioners to `work alongside me'.
   Conclusions People with long-term conditions struggle with acceptance of
   a diagnosis and symptoms, and acceptance of help which conflicts with
   their need to maintain independence and personal control. They
   self-manage every day, learning to plan, choose what and what not to do
   and negotiate with others to get tasks done and maintain quality of
   life. They manage better with support from understanding health
   practitioners, especially advanced nurses, with whom they have
   established a positive, sustained relationship.
   Relevance to clinical practice Active support for people to self-manage
   has been shown to assist people to achieve their goals and improve
   overall health and well-being. Nurses are well positioned to provide
   self-management support for people with long-term conditions but require
   allocated time and system changes to enable this. Practitioners need to
   acknowledge that it is difficult for people to accept diagnoses and
   symptoms and provide individualised support for this process. The desire
   to remain independent may limit acceptance of help, making it harder for
   people to maintain life quality. A change in length and content of
   consultations is required in order for practitioners to really get to
   know people and provide the self-management support they need to meet
   their goals.}},

Abstract = {{Objective The study aimed to assess outcomes in patients with severe and
   extreme anorexia nervosa managed with enhanced cognitive behavior
   therapy (CBT-E) in a real-world outpatient setting.
   Method Thirty patients with anorexia nervosa and body mass index (BMI)
   <16 aged >= 17 years were recruited from consecutive referrals to an
   eating disorder service clinic offering outpatient CBT-E. BMI and Eating
   Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q), Brief Symptom Inventory
   (BSI), and Clinical Impairment Assessment (CIA) scores were recorded at
   admission, end of treatment, and 20- and 60-week follow-ups for
   treatment completers.
   Results Twenty patients (66.7\%) completed the treatment and showed both
   considerable weight gain (Cohen's f = 1.43), and significantly reduced
   scores for clinical impairment (f = 1.26) and eating-disorder (f = 1.03)
   and general psychopathology (f = 0.99). Changes remained stable at both
   follow-ups. About half of the patients who completed treatment had a BMI
   >= 18.5 at the end of treatment and follow-ups.
   Discussion CBT-E seems suitable and promising for patients with severe
   and extreme anorexia nervosa seeking treatment in a real-world clinical
   setting, provided that their medical conditions are stable, and they
   have no current major depressive episodes or substance abuse; it may
   represent a valid alternative to inpatient treatment for those who are
   able to sustain engagement in a full course of outpatient treatment.}},

Title = {{Efficiency of the Summer Monsoon in Generating Streamflow Within a
   Snow-Dominated Headwater Basin of the Colorado River}},
Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{NOV 28}},
Abstract = {{The North American Monsoon occurs July-September in the central Rocky
   Mountains bringing significant rainfall to Colorado River headwater
   basins. This rain may buffer streamflow deficiencies caused by
   reductions in snow accumulation. Using a data-modeling framework, we
   explore the importance of monsoon rain in streamflow generation over
   historical conditions in an alpine basin. Annually, monsoon rain
   contributes 18 7\% water inputs and generates 10 6\% streamflow. The
   bulk of rain supports evapotranspiration in lower subalpine forests.
   However, rains have the potential to produce appreciable streamflow at
   higher elevations where soil moisture storage, forest cover, and aridity
   are low and rebound late season streamflow 64 13\% from simulated
   reductions in spring snowpack as a function of monsoon strength.
   Interannual variability in monsoon efficiency to generate streamflow
   declines with low snowpack and high aridity, implying the ability of
   monsoons to replenish streamflow in a warmer future with less snow
   accumulation will diminish.
   Plain Language Summary Monsoon rains bring much needed summer moisture
   to the southwestern United States, but it remains unclear whether rains
   have a significant effect on streamflow in the snow-dominated headwaters
   of the Colorado River. Lack of understanding is largely due to the
   difficulty in measuring rain and snowfall in steep, mountainous basins,
   and the effect both have on seasonal plant consumption of water. Using a
   hydrological model populated with ground, airborne, and synthesized
   climate data, we compare relative efficiency of monsoon rain to generate
   stream water over multiple decades in an alpine basin. Monsoon rains
   deliver one fifth of the basin's water and produce 10\% the annual
   streamflow, with additions largely confined to the upper elevations of
   the watershed where soils are thin, water is plentiful, and forests are
   less abundant. In contrast, lower elevations contain dense aspen and
   conifer forests that consume monsoon rain and limit streamflow response.
   Subsequently, even strong monsoon events cannot fully replenish lost
   snow. Summer rains produce more streamflow during cooler years with
   large snow accumulation. This hints that streamflow from summer rain may
   diminish in a warmer future with less snow.
   Key Points
   Monsoon rains generate 10 +/- 6\% of annual streamflow while late spring
   snowfall delivers twice as much for the same water input The influence
   of monsoon rain on streamflow is half of late spring snow due to
   evapotranspiration in the lower subalpine forest Monsoon efficiency in
   generating streamflow decreases in warm years with low snow accumulation}},

Abstract = {{Digital image analysis (DIA) is impacted by the quality of tissue
   staining. This study examined the influence of preanalytical
   variables-staining protocol design, reagent quality, section attributes,
   and instrumentation-on the performance of automated DIA software. Our
   hypotheses were that (1) staining intensity is impacted by subtle
   differences in protocol design, reagent quality, and section composition
   and that (2) identically programmed and loaded stainers will produce
   equivalent immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. We tested these
   propositions by using 1 hematoxylin and eosin stainer to process 13
   formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) mouse tissues and by using 3
   identically programmed and loaded immunostainers to process 5 FFPE mouse
   tissues for 4 cell biomarkers. Digital images of stained sections
   acquired with a commercial whole slide scanner were analyzed by
   customizable algorithms incorporated into commercially available DIA
   software. Staining intensity as viewed qualitatively by an observer
   and/or quantitatively by DIA was affected by staining conditions and
   tissue attributes. Intrarun and inter-run IHC staining intensities were
   equivalent for each tissue when processed on a given stainer but varied
   measurably across stainers. Our data indicate that staining quality must
   be monitored for each method and stainer to ensure that preanalytical
   factors do not impact digital pathology data quality.}},

Title = {{Convective Invigoration Traced to Warm-Rain Microphysics}},
Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{NOV 28}},
Abstract = {{Aerosols are postulated to alter moist convection by increasing cloud
   droplet number concentration (N-d). Cloud-resolving model simulations of
   radiative-convective equilibrium show that higher N-d leads to stronger
   convective mass flux, seemingly in line with a hypothesis that links the
   convective invigoration to delayed rain formation allowing more cloud
   liquid condensate to be frozen. Yet, the invigoration is also present in
   an alternative model configuration with warm-rain microphysics only,
   suggesting that ice microphysics is not central to the phenomenon. The
   key dynamical mechanism lies in the different vertical distributions of
   the increases in water vapor condensation and in cloud liquid
   reevaporation, causing a dipole pattern favoring convection. This is
   further supported by a pair of mechanism-denial experiments in which an
   imposed weakening of cloud liquid reevaporation tends to mute
   invigoration.
   Plain Language Summary Aerosols are thought to affect moist convection
   by increasing cloud droplet number concentration. According to a popular
   hypothesis, higher droplet number concentration would delay rain
   formation, allowing more cloud water to reach the freezing level. The
   additional latent heating from freezing is presumed to cause stronger
   convection. We test this hypothesis with a numerical model capable of
   simulating moist convection, and find that convective invigoration
   occurs even in the absence of ice processes. A detailed analysis
   suggests that the slowdown of rain formation increases cloud liquid
   reevaporation. The resulting cooling is balanced primarily by stronger
   water vapor condensation. This creates a vertical cooling-above-warming
   dipole pattern favorable to convection.
   Key Points
   Higher cloud droplet number concentration increases convective mass
   flux, even in the absence of ice microphysics The convective
   invigoration coincides with higher tropospheric relative humidity and
   reevaporation efficiency The dynamical mechanism involves a vertical
   dipole (cooling-above-warming) pattern}},

Title = {{A typology of learner profiles to anticipate and guide differentiation
   in primary classes}},
Journal = {{RESEARCH PAPERS IN EDUCATION}},
Abstract = {{While some research has highlighted how teachers prepare their course
   materials, little is known about how future teachers design support for
   their students, and thus plan and anticipate what can and will happen in
   the classroom. We have therefore sought to investigate whether
   identifiable learner profiles emerge when regular primary school
   students are offered a complex task: How students respond to the task?
   How well they perform? The ambition was to develop a typology of
   profiles concerning student task engagement that would allow any teacher
   to anticipate regulatory actions that would be matched as closely as
   possible to the realities of the classroom. To do this, we observed 282
   French-speaking Belgian students aged 10-12 years old in the first
   moments of performing a complex reading task. The data analysis revealed
   that six learner profiles can be used to plan teaching activities: the
   `regular' student, the student who gets discouraged because the task
   seems too complex, the one who gets blocked during the task, the one who
   bypasses the actual task without achieving the learning objectives, the
   one who does not engage in the task and the high-performing student who
   finishes faster than the others.}},

Title = {{Measuring satisfaction in the small animal consultation and its
   relationship to consult length}},
Journal = {{VETERINARY RECORD}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{187}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: Measuring satisfaction is a useful metric of success of any
   interaction, but very few validated instruments exist for measuring the
   satisfaction of the veterinary surgeon (vet) and the client in
   veterinary consultations. Additionally, there has been no research
   examining the impact of consultation length on satisfaction. The aim of
   this observational study was to investigate the use of a single-question
   graphic scale to assess vet and client satisfaction and the impact of
   consultation length on satisfaction.
   Methods: Information on consultation timing was collected for 65 health
   problem consultations across six practices. These measurements were
   compared with postconsultation measurements of client and vet
   satisfaction.
   Results: A comparison between the long-form and single-question
   satisfaction instruments demonstrated significant correlation for both
   vet and client tools (rho=0.609, P<0.005 and rho=0.483, P<0.005,
   respectively). The average client satisfaction with the consultation was
   high; however, vet satisfaction levels were significantly lower (U=1073,
   P<0.005). Increased consult length was associated with increased vet
   satisfaction (rho=0.332, P=0.007) but not increased client satisfaction.
   Conclusion: These results demonstrate that the graphic scale is an
   appropriate proxy for the pre-existing long-form questionnaires
   available for both vets and clients. Further research is required to
   examine the disparity identified between vet and client satisfaction.}},

Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{22}},
Month = {{NOV 28}},
Abstract = {{The retreat of glaciers in response to global warming has the potential
   to trigger landslides in glaciated regions around the globe. Landslides
   that enter fjords or lakes can cause tsunamis, which endanger people and
   infrastructure far from the landslide itself. Here we document the
   ongoing movement of an unstable slope (total volume of 455 x 10(6) m(3))
   in Barry Arm, a fjord in Prince William Sound, Alaska. The slope moved
   rapidly between 2010 and 2017, yielding a horizontal displacement of 120
   m, which is highly correlated with the rapid retreat and thinning of
   Barry Glacier. Should the entire unstable slope collapse at once,
   preliminary tsunami modeling suggests a maximum runup of 300 m near the
   landslide, which may have devastating impacts on local communities. Our
   findings highlight the need for interdisciplinary studies of recently
   deglaciated fjords to refine our understanding of the impact of climate
   change on landslides and tsunamis.}},

Abstract = {{The latest generation of coupled models, the sixth Coupled Models
   Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), is used to study the changes in the El
   Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in a warming climate. For the four
   future scenarios studied, the sea surface temperature variability
   increases in most CMIP6 models, but to varying degrees. This increase is
   linked to a weakening of the east-west temperature gradient in the
   tropical Pacific Ocean, which is evident across all models. Just as in
   previous generations of climate models, we find that many
   characteristics of future ENSO remain uncertain. This includes changes
   in dominant time scale, extratropical teleconnection patterns, and
   amplitude of El Nino and La Nina events. For models with the strongest
   increase in future variability, the majority of the increase happens in
   the Eastern Pacific, where the strongest El Nino events usually occur.}},

   Ensemble}},
Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{22}},
Month = {{NOV 28}},
Abstract = {{This study takes the first step to bridge the gap between the pressure
   drag of a shallow cloud ensemble and that of an individual cloud
   composed of rising thermals. It is found that the pressure drag for a
   cloud ensemble is primarily controlled by the dynamical component. The
   dominance of dynamical pressure drag and its increased magnitude with
   height are independent of cloud lifetime and are common features of
   individual clouds except that the total drag of a single cloud over life
   cycle presents vertical oscillations. These oscillations are associated
   with successive rising thermals but are further complicated by the
   evaporation-driven downdrafts outside the cloud. The horizontal
   vorticity associated with the vortical structure is amplified as the
   thermals rise to higher altitudes due to continuous baroclinic vorticity
   generation. This leads to the increased magnitude of local minima of
   dynamical pressure perturbation with height and consequently to
   increased dynamical pressure drag.}},

Title = {{The effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural therapy group-based
   interventions for men with intellectual disabilities and sexual
   offending histories: a meta-analysis}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Data from sex offender treatment programmes (SOTP) on the re-offending
   of convicted sex offenders from the prison service in England and Wales
   was recently reviewed and found to be associated with no change in
   sexual reoffending. While this result is at variance with a number of
   other reviews it does give rise to concern as most programmes for
   individuals with intellectual disabilities adopt similar treatment
   methods. It is therefore important to consider the treatment outcomes
   for this client group by conducting a meta-analysis to examine treatment
   effects.
   Method
   A systematic search of PsychINFO, EMBASE, MEDLINE and CINAHL was
   conducted in February 2019 using specific inclusion and exclusion
   criteria. Eighteen papers were identified, and their quality was
   assessed using a risk of bias framework. Scores on cognitive
   distortions, sexual knowledge and victim empathy measures as well as
   reports of further sexually abusive behaviour were pooled together to
   run a meta-analysis which yielded effect sizes for each outcome.
   Results
   A large treatment effect was found for reducing cognitive distortions
   and increasing victim empathy, with a moderate effect found for
   improvements in sexual knowledge. This meta-analysis also found that
   11.5\% of individuals with intellectual disabilities who have completed
   these programmes will go on to display further sexually abusive
   behaviours.
   Conclusions
   The findings suggest that cognitive distortions are significantly
   reduced following treatment, there are also significant improvements in
   sexual knowledge and victim empathy. A rate of 11.5\% for further
   reported sexually abusive behaviour during follow up periods was found,
   which is higher than the rate found for mainstream SOTP completers.
   Problems regarding the recording of sexually abusive behaviour are
   considered.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{128}},

Abstract = {{The strength of brittle porous media is of concern in numerous
   applications, for example, earth penetration, crater formation, and
   blast loading. Thus, it is of importance to possess techniques that
   allow for constitutive model calibration within the laboratory setting.
   The goal of the current work is to demonstrate an experimental technique
   allowing for strength assessment of porous media subjected to shock
   loading, which can be implemented into pressure-dependent yield surfaces
   within numerical simulation schemes. As a case study, the deviatoric
   response of distended alpha-SiO2 has been captured in a tamped
   Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) environment at a pressure regime of
   4-10GPa. Hydrocode simulations were used to interpret RMI experimental
   data, and a resulting pressure-dependent yield surface akin to the often
   employed modified Drucker-Prager model was calibrated. Simulations
   indicate that the resulting jet length generated by the RMI is sensitive
   to the porous media strength, thereby providing a feasible experimental
   platform capable of capturing the pressurized granular deviatoric
   response. Furthermore, in efforts to validate the RMI-calibrated
   strength model, a set of Mach-lens experiments was performed and
   simulated with the calibrated pressure-dependent yield surface.
   Excellent agreement between the resulting Mach-lens length in experiment
   and simulation provides additional confidence to the RMI yield-surface
   calibration scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Biradicaloid compounds with an open-shell ground state have been the
   subject of intense research in the past decade. Although diindenoacenes
   are one of the most developed families, only a few examples have been
   reported as active layers in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs)
   with a charge mobility of around 10(-3) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) due to a steric
   disadvantage of the mesityl group to kinetically stabilize compounds.
   Herein, we disclose our efforts to improve the charge transport of the
   diindenoacene family based on hexahydro-diindenopyrene (HDIP)
   derivatives with different annelation modes for which the most reactive
   position has been functionalized with (triisopropylsilyl)ethynyl (TIPS)
   groups. All the HDIP derivatives show remarkably higher stability than
   that of TIPS-pentacene, enduring for 2 days to more than 30 days, which
   depends on the oxidation potential, the contribution of the singlet
   biradical form in the ground state and the annelation mode. The
   annelation mode affects not only the band gap and the biradical
   character (y(0)) but also the value of the singlet-triplet energy gap
   (Delta ES-T) that does not follow the reverse trend of y(0). A method
   based on comparison between experimental and theoretical bond lengths
   has been disclosed to estimate y(0) and shows that y(0) computed at the
   projected unrestricted Hartree-Fock (PUHF) level is the most relevant
   among those reported by all other methods. Thanks to their high
   stability, thin-film OFETs were successfully fabricated. Well balanced
   ambipolar transport was obtained in the order of 10(-3) cm(2) V-1 s(-1)
   in the bottom-gate/top-contact configuration, and unipolar transport in
   the top-gate/bottom-contact configuration was obtained in the order of
   10(-1) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) which is the highest value obtained for biradical
   compounds with a diindenoacene skeleton.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical simulation results for the unsteady thermal and stressed
   states of a nozzle vane under unsteady operation conditions of the gas
   turbine are presented. The vane and nozzle block duct 3D computer model
   was constructed. The finite element mesh form, its sizes, and
   calculation time steps were optimized. The vane and duct contained 1.7
   and 3.6 mln elements and 2.3 and 0.8 mln nodes, respectively. The mesh
   smoothing with corresponding nodal displacement near the transition
   zones and in the vicinity of curvilinear surfaces was used. The
   simulation consisted in successive numerical solutions of nonstationary
   flow problems for a moving medium and heat, transfer, thermal
   conductivity, and thermoelasticity problems for the vane. The parameters
   of unsteady thermal loading conditions were defined. The thermal
   properties of the moving medium and vane material were assumed to be
   time-dependent. For turbine power improvement conditions, time
   variations of duct flow parameters, temperatures, thermal stresses in
   different vane zones, their gradients and rates were analyzed. The
   essential nonuniformity of the thermostressed vane state and zones of
   thermal stresses, almost reaching the ultimate strength of the material,
   were noted. The effect of general heat flow components on the
   disturbance of thermal stresses was shown. Emphasis was placed upon the
   appearance of tensile stresses on a heated trailing edge of the vane
   (most critical zone). The conclusion was drawn regarding a potential
   application of a MAX phase Ti2ALC us a structural material for the vanes
   of short-life gas turbines.}},

Title = {{The Role of Diabatic Heating in Ferrel Cell Dynamics}},
Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{NOV 28}},
Abstract = {{The Ferrel cell consists of the zonal mean vertical and meridional winds
   in the midlatitudes. The continuity of the Ferrel circulation and the
   zonal mean momentum and heat budgets imply a collocation of the
   eddy-driven jet and poleward eddy heat flux maxima, under certain
   assumptions, including the negligibility of diabatic heating. The latter
   assumption is questioned, since midlatitude storms are associated with
   latent heating in the midtroposphere. In this study, the heat budget of
   the Ferrel cell in both hemispheres is examined, using the JRA55
   reanalysis data set. The diabatic heating rate is significant close to
   the center of the Ferrel cell during winter and at the ascending branch
   during summer in both hemispheres. The interannual variability shows a
   positive correlation between the diabatic heating rate in the
   midlatitude midtroposphere and the latitudinal separation between the
   eddy heat flux and the eddy-driven jet maxima during winter in both
   hemispheres.
   Plain Language Summary The midlatitude climate is affected by storms,
   organized in regions called ``storm tracks.{''} Storms are carried
   eastward by the midlatitude jet stream. The storm track and the jet
   stream are dynamically coupled, through the heat and momentum budgets.
   Here we use the heat and momentum budgets, and the continuity of the
   midlatitude meridional circulation cell, called the ``Ferrel cell,{''}
   to examine the connection between the latitudinal locations of the storm
   track and jet stream. We focus on the role of diabatic heating by latent
   heat release in midlatitude storms in the heat budget, and its effect on
   the circulation. Our analysis shows that the latitudinal separation
   between the storm track and jet stream increases as the diabatic heating
   in the midlatitude midtroposphere increases during winter. These results
   highlight the role of diabatic heating in the midlatitude circulation,
   which is often overlooked.
   Key Points

Abstract = {{Objectives The purpose of this study was to determine the outcome of
   head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients developing lung
   metastasis.
   Design Retrospective study.
   Participants HNSCC patients with lung metastasis treated between 2001
   and 2018 were included.
   Mean outcomes measures Statistical analyses described the relationship
   between patient survival, treatment efficacy and pulmonary metastasis
   occurrence.
   Results One hundred HNSCC patients were included in the study. The
   median overall survival (OS) was 21 months. The median recurrence-free
   survival (RFS) was seven months. Patient survival with only lung
   metastases was significantly longer compared to patients with lung
   metastases and lymph nodes involvement or other metastases. Moreover,
   patients with a single metastasis had longer post-RFS and OS than
   patients with multiple metastases. The local control of metastasis was
   better when patients presented only lung metastases, and it was more
   effective in single metastasis. The surgery allowed better metastases
   local control than supportive care or radio and/or chemotherapy. In case
   of specific therapy, pulmonary resection was associated with a longer
   post-RFS and a longer OS compared to supportive care or radio and/or
   chemotherapy.
   Conclusions We confirmed, in the current study, the significant survival
   benefit for HNSCC patients treated by surgery for their pulmonary
   metastasis. While treatment of multiple metastases required palliative
   chemotherapy or best supportive care in most of the cases, specific
   surgical treatment in selected HNSCC patients should be considered.}},

Title = {{Role played by the nanowire/nanowire junctions in the electrical

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{128}},
Number = {{20}},
Month = {{NOV 28}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we highlight the key role played by Si nanowire/nanowire
   junctions in the electrical performance of field-effect transistors
   (FETs) based on percolating Si nanowire (SiNW) networks, also called
   nanonets. Using our original technological process to fabricate
   simultaneously numerous silicon nanonet-based transistors with a
   variable geometry, we thoroughly investigated in this paper their
   electrical properties for various channel lengths from 5 to 100 mu m. In
   particular, we evidenced a clear transition in the FET performance, when
   NW/NW junctions are involved in the conduction path. On the one hand,
   for channel length shorter than that of nanowires (NWs), the devices are
   called multiple-parallel-channel FETs as NWs directly bridge the
   channel, and they exhibit poor electrical performance in terms of OFF
   current, ON-to-OFF ratio, and subthreshold slope. On the other hand, for
   channel length longer than that of nanowires (NWs), the devices are
   called nanonet-FETs (NN-FETs) as the current flows through percolating
   paths made of NWs and NW/NW junctions and the performance are
   considerably enhanced. By combining our structural knowledge of the
   material with experimental observations of electrical properties and
   modeling results, by relying on the percolation theory, the model for
   electrical transport in polycrystalline silicon and the principle of
   potential barrier lowering by the field effect, we propose the junction
   driven percolation mechanism. It explains the role played by the
   nanowire/nanowire junctions in the electrical properties of
   semiconductor percolating nanowire networks and how they drastically
   enhanced the electrical properties of nanowire-based field-effect
   transistors despite the disorder introduced by the increasing number of
   nanowires. As a consequence, by controlling properly the junction
   interfaces and device geometry for a given NW density, thanks to NW/NW
   junctions, the NN-based devices are a valuable and promising alternative
   to improve the electrical performances of NW-based devices for future
   developments.}},

Abstract = {{Aim:
   The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a self-report
   instrument measuring patients', family members', and staff's perceived
   support from light and color in the physical environment of an emergency
   department (ED)-the Light and Color Questionnaire (LCQ).
   Background:
   The physical care environment is an important part of a comprehensive
   caring approach in all levels of care not only for patients but also for
   family members and staff. However, no existing self-report questionnaire
   assessing the extent to which light and color are perceived as being
   supportive in the physical care environment from the users' perspective
   was found.
   Method:
   The LCQ was developed as part of a pre-post study in which an ED serving
   125,000 people was refurbished and remodeled using evidence-based
   design. The LCQ consists of six items for light and five items for color
   and assesses awareness/orientation, safety/security, functional
   abilities, privacy, personal control, and stimulation. The study was
   carried out in four steps: constructions of items, assessment of face
   validity, data collection, and data analysis.
   Result/Conclusion:
   Psychometric evaluation of the two versions, LCQ-Patient/Family member
   and LCQ-Staff, showed satisfactory content and internal validity (>90\%)
   and high internal consistency (Cronbach's coefficient alpha = .9) to
   support the use of the questionnaire for research and development
   purposes. Explorative factor analysis of a total of 600 questionnaire
   responses confirmed light and color as distinctive and independent
   dimensions creating perceptions of more or less supportiveness for
   respondents. The LCQ instrument may be useful for architects,
   administrators, and researchers of healthcare environments.}},

Abstract = {{In 2020, the Yangtze River (YR) suffered a long-persisting Meiyu season.
   The accumulated rainfall broke its record since 1961 and caused severe
   flooding and death in China. Our results show the sequential warm and
   cold Meiyu front regulated by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) was
   responsible for this unexpected extreme Meiyu event. From 11 to 25 June
   with the positive NAO, the interaction between the South Asian High
   (SAH) and the western Pacific subtropical high maintained a warm front
   to strengthen the rainband north of the YR. Afterward, the coupling
   between SAH and midlatitude Mongolian Cyclone induced a cold front,
   which retreated the rainband to the south of YR from 30 June to 13 July
   with the negative NAO. Although the ECMWF S2S model successfully
   predicted the warm-front-related Meiyu rainband, it failed to forecast
   the Meiyu rainband in the cold-front period, suggesting a great
   challenge of S2S forecasting on Meiyu rainfall.}},

Title = {{Modelling the lifetime of banknotes with a semi-Markov chain model}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY}},
Abstract = {{The quality of banknotes in circulation is important for cash cycles.
   Central banks continuously try to find new methods for improving the
   quality of banknotes in circulation, whether by improving the
   specification of the banknotes or the characteristics of the cash cycle.
   The way that banknotes deteriorate and the speed with which they do so
   are some of the main factors affecting the quality of banknotes in
   circulation and thus, have been drawing the interest of central banks.
   This study develops a new semi-Markov chain model that could be used by
   banknote printing companies and central banks to model banknote
   deterioration. Discrete states of fitness are used in this semi-Markov
   model to simulate how the banknotes transit between fitness levels. The
   model requires some input parameters to simulate the cash cycle and
   present the probability distributions for each state. It is applied to
   theoretical cash cycles and a sensitivity analysis is performed to
   identify the parameters that have the greatest impact on the quality of
   banknotes. This study is the first to apply a semi-Markov model to
   estimate the lifetime of banknotes. It can be used as a forecasting tool
   for the proportion of unfit banknotes in circulation.}},

   double-core-hole photoelectron spectrum obtained in isolated water
   molecules irradiated with hard x-rays above the oxygen K -2 threshold.
   States of the type O K -2V and multiply excited states are created by
   single-photon absorption and subsequent one-electron emission. A
   detailed analysis enabled by high experimental resolution reveals
   dissociative nuclear dynamics in the K-2V pre-edge states. At the
   binding energies above the K- 2 double-ionization potential, a complex
   spectral pattern is observed and attributed to highly excited states
   involving multiple shake-up excitation processes with the aid of state-
   of-the-art theoretical calculations. A strong broadening due to the
   nuclear motion indicates a highly dissociative nature of these multiply
   excited states, in agreement with the theoretical analysis.}},

Abstract = {{We combine density functional theory and many body perturbation theory
   to investigate the electronic properties of Si(100) and Ge(100) surfaces
   terminated with halogen atoms (-I, -Br, -Cl, -F) and other chemical
   functionalizations (-H, -OH, -CH3) addressing the absolute values of
   their work function, electronic affinity and ionization potential. Our
   results point out that electronic properties of functionalized surfaces
   strongly depend on the chemisorbed species and much less on the surface
   crystal orientation. The presence of halogens at the surface always
   leads to an increment of the work function, ionization potential and
   electronic affinity with respect to fully hydrogenated surfaces. On the
   contrary, the presence of polar -OH and -CH3 groups at the surface leads
   to a reduction of the aforementioned quantities with respect to the
   H-terminated system. Starting from the work functions calculated for the
   Si and Ge passivated surfaces, we apply a simple model to estimate the
   properties of functionalized SiGe surfaces. The possibility of
   modulating the work function by changing the chemisorbed species and
   composition is predicted. The effects induced by different terminations
   on the band energy line-up profile of SiGe surfaces are then analyzed.
   Interestingly, our calculations predict a type-II band offset for the
   H-terminated systems and a type-I band offset for the other cases.}},

Title = {{Can I Be Me With You at Work? Examining Relational Authenticity and
   Discretionary Behaviors in the Workplace}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE}},
Abstract = {{Management scholars have long been interested in the topic of
   authenticity in the workplace, evidenced by the history of scholarship
   on authentic leadership and the many new authenticity constructs that
   have emerged. In this article, we take a narrower view of authenticity
   and focus on relational authenticity in the workplace, which we define
   as being genuine in workplace relationships. Adapting a validated
   relational authenticity scale to the organizational context, we explore
   the ways in which feeling authentic in workplace relationships has
   ramifications for discretionary behaviors. Specifically, we build on
   belongingness theory to posit that relational authenticity will result
   in an increase in engagement in both altruistic and sportsmanship
   behaviors. We also explore the moderating effect of proactive
   personality on these relationships. Results from our two-sample study (N
   = 352; 500) indicate that relational authenticity is positively
   associated with engagement in both altruistic and sportsmanship
   behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Britain's political parties can be divided into two blocs: a
   `progressive bloc' of parties on the left/centre-left, and a
   `reactionary bloc' of those on the right/centre-right. In three of the
   last four general elections, the progressive bloc won an appreciably
   larger share of the popular vote than its reactionary rival. Yet its
   greater internal fragmentation has been repeatedly punished under first
   past the post, leading to what is now over a decade of Conservative-led
   governments. This has prompted growing pressure to form a `progressive
   alliance' between Labour, Liberal Democrats, Greens, and their Scottish,
   Welsh and Northern Irish nationalist competitors. This article sheds a
   historical and international light on these demands, examining the
   difficulties other similar efforts at progressive cooperation have faced
   across the world. It considers how progressive alliances have previously
   sought to overcome geographical, ideological, and social divides between
   their constituent members, and draws some salutary lessons for British
   progressives today.}},

Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{NOV 28}},
Abstract = {{The main ultraviolet auroral emission at Saturn consists of multiple
   structures forming a discontinuous ring of emission around the poles,
   occasionally organized in a global spiral. We present continuous
   observation of an auroral spiral rotating at similar to 85\% of rigid
   corotation during several hours. Simultaneously, energetic neutral atom
   (ENA) emissions revealed a hot magnetospheric plasma population located
   in the same local time sector as the ends of the rotating spiral.
   Following plasma theory, we propose that pressure gradients induced by
   the energized plasma distorted the magnetospheric current system,
   resulting in the spiral morphology of the aurora. The rotating hot
   plasma was several times reenergized in the dusk sector during at least
   2 days, generating a long-lasting auroral spiral. The ultraviolet
   spiral, the ENA emissions, and the ions revealed by this
   multi-instrument data set are three signatures of a
   magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling current system and of the associated
   hot plasma population rotating around Saturn.
   Key Points
   The main auroral emission forms a spiral observed during two consecutive
   days The spiral morphology is due to the presence of a hot plasma
   population in the magnetodisc The auroral spiral winds while the hot
   plasma bubble expands due to gradient and curvature drifts}},

Abstract = {{The development of hybrid hydrogels has been of great interest over
   recent decades, especially in the field of biomaterials. Such hydrogels
   provide various opportunities in tissue engineering, drug delivery, and
   regenerative medicine due to their ability to mimic cellular
   environments, sequester and release therapeutic agents, and respond to
   stimuli. Herein we report the synthesis and characterization of an
   injectable poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel crosslinked via
   thiol-maleimide reactions and containing both chemically crosslinked
   temperature-sensitive liposomes (TSLs) and matrix
   metalloproteinase-sensitive peptide crosslinks. Rheological studies
   demonstrate that the hydrogel is mechanically stable and can be
   synthesized to achieve a range of physically applicable moduli.
   Experiments characterizing the in situ drug delivery and degradation of
   these materials indicate that the TSL gel responds to both thermal and
   enzymatic stimuli in a local environment. Doxorubicin, a widely used
   anticancer drug, was loaded in the TSLs with a high encapsulation
   efficiency and the subsequent release was temperature dependent.
   Finally, TSLs did not compromise viability and proliferation of human
   and murine fibroblasts, supporting the use of these hydrogel-linked
   liposomes as a thermo-responsive drug carrier for controlled release.}},

Abstract = {{Background A laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is usually inserted by
   conventional 7 cm head elevation. However, little is known about the
   association of head elevation degree and LMA insertion. We hypothesized
   that 14 cm head elevation would increase the first attempt success rate
   of LMA Supreme insertion compared with conventional 7 cm head elevation
   in patients undergoing transurethral resection of bladder tumour.
   Methods Patients were randomly allocated to the high group (n = 55, 14
   cm head elevation) or the control group (n = 55, conventional 7 cm head
   elevation). The primary outcome was the first attempt success rate of
   LMA Supreme insertion.
   Results The first attempt success rate was significantly higher in the
   high group than in the control group (53 {[}96.4\%] vs 40 {[}72.7\%], P
   = .001, relative risk = 1.30, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] =
   1.12-1.57, absolute risk reduction = 23.7\%). Fibreoptic bronchoscope
   grade 4 (ie optimal position of the LMA) was significantly higher in the
   high group (35 {[}64.8\%] vs 18 {[}36.7\%], P = .004, relative risk =

   Conclusions Head elevation of 14 cm height increased the first attempt
   success rate of LMA Supreme insertion and fibreoptic bronchoscopic grade
   in patients undergoing transurethral resection of bladder tumour. High
   head elevation can be an effective option for successful LMA Supreme
   insertion.

   membranes for energy-efficient air-dehumidification}},

Abstract = {{Isothermal membrane-based air dehumidification (IMAD) is much more
   energy-efficient and economical than traditional air-dehumidification
   technologies. There are, however, no practical IMAD process technologies
   currently available mainly due to limitations of current membranes.
   Ionic liquids (ILs) are a promising air-dehumidification membrane
   material. Current supported IL membranes suffer from poor stability,
   limiting their performances. Herein, we propose new stable IL membranes,
   encapsulated IL membranes (EILMs) by encapsulating
   1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide ({[}C4MIM]{[}Br]) into ultrathin
   polycrystalline UiO-66-NH2 metal-organic framework membranes via a
   ship-in-a-bottle method. The stability of IL membranes is significantly
   enhanced due to the IL entrapped in the pore cages of UiO-66-NH2. The
   EILMs show unprecedentedly high H2O permeance (similar to 2.36 x 10(-4)
   mol m(-2) s(-1) Pa-1), an order of magnitude greater than that of the
   most permeable air-dehumidification membranes reported so far.
   Furthermore, the encapsulated {[}C4MIM]{[}Br] drastically increases the
   H2O/N-2 separation factor to similar to 1560, satisfying the minimally
   required H2O/N-2 separation performance for commercially viable
   air-dehumidification.}},

Title = {{Turning Bourdieu back upon sexual field theory}},
Journal = {{SEXUALITIES}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, sexual field theory has emerged as the cutting edge of
   the sociology of sexuality. This paper turns Bourdieu's own formulation
   of field back upon sexual field theory to investigate sites where sexual
   field theorists break from Bourdieu and what questions these sites of
   divergence raise. I pinpoint two unresolved issues in sexual field
   theory: (1) the ambiguous boundaries of sexual fields and (2) the
   obfuscation of power. Both points relate to the autonomy of sexual life,
   which sexual field theorists may overstate. This paper recommends new
   lines of analysis which may advance field theory more broadly, the
   sociology of sexuality, and the feminist reinvention of Bourdieu.}},

Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{22}},
Month = {{NOV 28}},
Abstract = {{Quantifying the volume of water that is stored in the subsurface is
   critical to studies of water availability to ecosystems, slope
   stability, and water-rock interactions. In a variety of settings, water
   is stored in fractured and weathered bedrock as rock moisture. However,
   few techniques are available to measure rock moisture in unsaturated
   rock, making direct estimates of water storage dynamics difficult to
   obtain. Here, we use borehole nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) at two
   sites in seasonally dry California to quantify dynamic rock moisture
   storage. We show strong agreement between NMR estimates of dynamic
   storage and estimates derived from neutron logging and mass balance
   techniques. The depths of dynamic storage are up to 9 m and likely
   reflect the depth extent of root water uptake. To our knowledge, these
   data are the first to quantify the volume and depths of dynamic water
   storage in the bedrock vadose zone via borehole NMR.}},

Title = {{A new method to detect targets in hyperspectral images based on
   principal component analysis}},
Journal = {{GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL}},
Abstract = {{Target detection (TD) is a major task in hyperspectral image (HSI)
   processing which, due to the high spectral resolution, requires dealing
   with the curse of dimensionality. The integrated feature extraction and
   selection is a well-known solution for dimensionality reduction of HSIs.
   In this study, a new method is presented to improve the performance of
   TD algorithms based on principal component analysis (PCA) feature space.
   In this method, using the implantation of the target spectrum (TS) in
   the HSI and following the simulated targets in the PCA feature space,
   the best principal components (PCs) are selected. Then, using the mixing
   and unmixing coefficients of the PCs, a new TS and a new image in the
   PCA feature space are created. Afterwards, using the new spectrum of the
   target, the TD algorithm is run on the new HSI. The performance of the
   proposed method is compared to nine counterpart algorithms on Hymap and
   Hyperion HSI. All the comparisons are performed using adaptive coherence
   estimator (ACE) TD algorithm. Experimental results illustrate that the
   proposed method, compared to its counterparts, yields superior
   performance based on the false alarm rate (FAR) measure. It gives an
   average FAR value of about 16, which is approximately 9\% better than
   that of its best counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{The chemical properties of a prototypical labile mono-EMF,
   Y@C-s(6)-C-82, have been systematically disclosed for the first time via
   a Bingel-Hirsch reaction. Three mono-adduct isomers, namely, 2a, 2b and
   2c out of 44 possibilities for the Y@C-s(6)-C-82 cage have been readily
   isolated, demonstrating surprisingly high regioselectivity.
   Crystallographic results of 2b unambiguously confirm its molecular
   structure with a singly bonded bromomalonate group attached onto the
   C-s(6)-C-82 cage. Further computational results rationalize that the
   high regioselectivity is a consequence of the localization of high spin
   density and large frontier molecular orbital distribution on the
   corresponding carbon atoms stemming from the encapsulation of an yttrium
   atom into the low-symmetry C-s(6)-C-82 cage with three-electron transfer
   from the metal to the cage.}},

Abstract = {{A cucurbit{[}6]uril-based (CB{[}6]) luminescent supramolecular assembly
   {[}CdL4](2-)center dot CB{[}6] (1) has been successfully synthesized
   using anthracene carboxylic acid (HL) as a structure-directing agent. It
   has high water stability, easy regeneration ability and rapid response
   time. Investigation reveals that among the 12 species of antibiotics
   under investigation, 1 displayed high selectivity toward nitrofurazone
   (NFZ) and nitrofurantoin (NFT) through luminescence quenching, and the
   detection is not disturbed by the presence of other species. The limit
   of detection (LOD) for NFZ and NFT were calculated to be 90 and 49 ppb,
   respectively, indicating the ultra-sensitivity. Further studies reveal
   that 1 can be successfully applied for the detection of NFZ in simulated
   wastewater and urine with satisfactory results. More exhilaratingly,
   test strips based on 1 were successfully prepared, which can be used for
   naked-eye sensing of NFZ and NFT in water with emission color changes
   from bright blue to dark. These interesting results indicate that 1 can
   serve as a promising luminescent sensor in various potential

Title = {{Poleward Excursions by the Himalayan Subtropical Jet Over the Past Four
   Centuries}},

Abstract = {{Since the 1980s, the subtropical jet stream has generally moved
   poleward, but its behavior varies by region and season. Here we examine
   the interannual variability and trends in the latitudinal position of
   the spring subtropical jet over the Himalayas. During the modern period
   (1948 to 2018), the spring (March-April-May) jet is typically anchored
   immediately south of the Himalayas but has rarely (in 1956, 1971, 1984,
   and 1999) moved poleward to pass over Kyrgyzstan and northwest China. A
   tree-ring reconstruction of the jet's latitude indicates that such
   poleward excursions may have become more frequent after 1950, but it is
   not clear whether that behavior is unprecedented within the past four
   centuries. These insights into the behavior of the Himalayan subtropical
   jet may improve seasonal weather forecasts for the region and provide a
   target for climate simulations to test whether the recent spate of
   excursions is unusual and due to anthropogenic warming.
   Plain Language Summary The subtropical jet stream (STJ) is a band of
   high-speed westerly winds in the upper atmosphere located near the
   subtropics. Since the 1980s, the STJ has generally moved poleward, but
   its behavior varies strongly by region and season. We studied the STJ
   over the Himalayas and found, during 1948-2018, that the spring STJ is
   typically anchored near the Himalayan foothills. In a few years (1956,
   1971, 1984, and 1999); however, it has moved far north to pass over
   Kyrgyzstan and northwest China. A tree-ring reconstruction of the jet's
   north-south position suggests that this type of poleward tracks has
   happened before, but the past few decades may be unusual due to the
   number of such events. Including the potential north-south range of the
   Himalayan subtropical jet into forecasting models might help improve the
   accuracy of spring weather predictions in this region. Our multicentury
   record can be used to test how well models simulate the Himalayan jet
   and investigate whether anthropogenic warming is the cause of the recent
   poleward extremes.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, lipophilicity of 21 cycloalkylspiro-5-hidantoins was
   assessed. The overall goal of lipophilicity evaluation is preliminary
   investigation which should result in a decrease of the traditionally
   high attrition rates for compounds entering clinical trials.
   Lipophilicity assessment was done by reversed-phase thin-layer
   chromatography and in silico methods. Chromatographic analyses were
   performed on C-18 modified thin-layer of silica gel with a two-component
   mobile phase consisting of water and organic solvent (acetonitrile,
   acetone, dioxane, or tetrahydrofuran) in different ratios. The
   chromatographic lipophilicities (R (M) (0)) were discussed and compared
   with computational log Ps calculated with various algorithms as well as
   in silico ADMET descriptors using linear regression and multivariate
   approach (hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component
   analysis). A high correlation was obtained between R (M) (0) values and
   calculated log P indicating a strong relationship between the variables.
   Multivariate data analysis enabled the comparison of the chemical
   structures, lipophilicity, pharmacokinetic predictors and toxicity of
   the investigated compounds.}},

   Campaign}},

Abstract = {{Aircraft measurements of shallow cumulus cases from the Routine
   Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Aerial Facility (AAF) Clouds
   with Low Optical Water Depths (CLOWD) Optical Radiative Observations
   (RACORO) campaign are studied in a transformed Paluch diagram. Previous
   studies have interpreted samples in Paluch diagrams in terms of
   two-point mixing and buoyancy sorting. The two-point mixing behavior is
   frequently seen in the RACORO observations and can be unambiguously
   distinguished from buoyancy sorting. The latter is not found in the
   RACORO observations and is also rare in a large-eddy simulation (LES) of
   a RACORO case. As opposed to often assumed gradual dilution of updrafts,
   around half of the instances of two-point mixing show no clear evidence
   of updraft dilution. We also find substantial spread in the properties
   of parcels that have adjusted to their level of neutral buoyancy and
   that a LES with horizontally homogeneous surface underestimates this
   spread. The inclusion of surface heterogeneity in the LES improves the
   agreement of its horizontal moisture variations with the aircraft
   measurements.
   Plain Language Summary Previous studies have proposed two-point mixing
   and buoyancy sorting to describe cloud dynamics. Using a mixing diagram
   to analyze aircraft measurements of temperature and moisture in shallow
   clouds and their surroundings, and taking noncloudy air into account, we
   identify the two-point mixing scenario but find no instance of buoyancy
   sorting. Fingerprints of mixing between clouds and environment, as well
   as vertical air displacement driven by buoyancy, are identified. Cloudy
   updrafts experience no noticeable dilution in around half of the
   two-point mixing instances. Surface heat flux variations enhance the
   cloud layer horizontal variation of moisture and increase overall cloud
   fraction.
   Key Points
   Aircraft measurements of shallow cumuli show two-point mixing but no
   ongoing buoyancy sorting Around half of the instances of two-point
   mixing show no noticeable updraft dilution Including surface
   heterogeneity yields better agreement of the cloud layer horizontal
   moisture variation between LES and observations}},

Abstract = {{We analyze data from 6,466 multistage horizontal hydraulic fracturing
   wells drilled into the Montney Formation over a large region in western

   characteristics on the distribution of hydraulic fracturing-induced

   estimate of the seismogenic activation potential of each well. Our
   results fit the observed spatial variability, including an enigmatic
   change in seismicity at 120 degrees W that does not correlate with any
   change in industrial activity. Feature importance analysis provides
   insight into data types that have the greatest impact on the results.
   Based on current data, seismogenic activation potential is most strongly
   influenced by depth of injection and distance of the well to the
   Cordilleran thrust belt.}},

Abstract = {{The rosemary distillation industry produces a considerable amount of
   rosemary distillation residues (RRs), which can be an alternative for
   feeding animals in harsh conditions and could enhance animal product
   quality. Given the meat quality is largely influenced by its fat content
   and fatty acid composition, the fatty acid (FA) profiles of longissimus
   thoracis et lumborum (LTL), semi-membranous (SM) muscles, and caudal
   (CFs) and omental fats (OFs) were determined using 21 Barbarine lambs
   fed with or without RRs. Diets contained 600 g of concentrate plus 600 g
   of forage. Forage represented oat hay, RR87 and RR60 pellets containing
   87 \% or 60 \% of RR, respectively. At the end of the study, all lambs
   were slaughtered, and the fatty acid profile was studied.
   The inclusion of RR increased the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)
   contents and reduced saturated fatty acids (SFAs), and the thrombogenic
   and saturation indexes in all tissues. The SM muscle was the richest
   tissue in PUFAs, n-3 and n-6; however, both adipose tissues contained
   the highest proportions of SFAs. Especially the OF was the richest
   tissue in oleic acid and SFAs. Feeding RR to lambs enhanced meat

Abstract = {{The high earth abundance and large specific capacity of aluminum on
   either a volume (8040 mA h cm(-3)) or mass (2980 mA h g(-1)) basis
   continues to drive interest in electrochemical cells that utilize
   metallic Al as the anode. At practical anode capacities, uneven and
   non-planar deposition of Al during battery recharge combined with the
   high Young's modulus (E-Al = 70 Ga) of the metal limits the electrode
   lifetime in all known electrolytes. Here we study the effect of a thin,
   textured coating composed of two-dimensional gold nanosheets with strong
   diffraction from (111) facets and low lattice mismatch for Al, as a
   substrate for regulating the Al electrodeposit morphology. We report
   that these coatings are not only effective in preventing Al deposition
   in non-planar morphologies, but have a large beneficial effect on the
   reversibility of Al electrodes. In Al plating/stripping studies, the
   textured Au coatings sustain stable cell operations for 500 cycles or
   more with a high coulombic efficiency of over 99\%. Full cell Al
   batteries composed of the Au nanosheets as the anode substrate and
   graphene as the cathode are reported to exhibit capacity retention of
   80\% after 1000 charge-discharge cycles, and 74\% at the 2000th cycle,
   exceeding the lifetimes (similar to 200 cycles) of comparable Al
   batteries in which a standard stainless steel material is used as the
   anode substrate. Our results demonstrate that through rational design of
   the substrate for Al deposition, both the electrodeposit morphology and
   cycle life of Al-based batteries can be markedly improved.}},

Abstract = {{For recovery of gallium from Bayer liquor, adsorption, and elution on
   amidoxime resin for gallium (Ga), vanadium (V), and aluminum (Al) ions
   in alkaline solution were systematically investigated by batch and
   column experiment. Amidoxime resin did not adsorb Al. The adsorption
   separation efficiency of Ga and V increased with increasing NaOH
   concentration and decreasing temperature and contact time. The
   adsorption kinetics of Ga and V are fit by a pseudo-second-order model.
   The adsorption isotherms of Ga and V could be fit well by the Langmuir
   model. Gallium was easily eluted using low concentration acid (1 similar
   to 2 mol/L H+), but it was difficult to elute V. Although high
   concentration acid could elute 70\% of V, this treatment would destroy
   resin. With high NaOH concentration and a long eluting time, more than
   50\% of V could be eluted at temperatures greater than 50 degrees C, and
   NaOH did no damage to the resin. The optimum condition of Ga separation
   from V and Al is at low temperature with short contact time and high
   NaOH concentration. After adsorption and desorption, a high-purity Ga is
   obtained, from which V can be recovered V by elution with a strong NaOH
   concentration at 50 degrees C. FT-IR spectra and XPS showed that the
   adsorption mechanism of Ga was only related to interaction with oxygen
   atoms of amidoxime groups (C = NOH). Furthermore, the adsorption
   mechanism of V was related to both nitrogen and oxygen atoms of
   amidoxime groups that caused the difficulty of desorbing V from resin.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic variations in the root traits of rice remain unexplored in
   relation to varietal groups and diverse ecosystems. Therefore, we
   evaluated 257 Bangladeshi accessions, which included landraces and
   improved varieties belonging to four ecotypes (Aus, Aman, Boro and
   Jhum), to understand genetic variations in the total root length (TRL),
   maximum root length and root number under different concentrations of
   ammonium and nitrate nitrogen in hydroponic culture. There were large
   variations in all traits across all nitrogen levels. Active elongation
   of individual roots of the landrace type across all nitrogen conditions
   suggested a higher potential for the uptake of nutrients by extending
   roots distribution in any nitrogen environment, while the active
   development of primary root primordia in the improved type in the
   presence of nitrate suggested a higher potential for the uptake of
   nitrate from the soil surface by extending roots distribution around
   soil surface. Cluster analysis classified the examined accessions into
   two groups according to their TRL: cluster I with a longer TRL and
   cluster II with a shorter TRL across all nitrogen conditions. Each of
   these groups was further divided into two sub-clusters: sub-cluster Ia,
   in which the longer TRL resulted from active development of primary root
   primordia, sub-cluster Ib, in which the longer TRL resulted from active
   elongation of individual roots, sub-cluster IIa, in which the shorter
   TRL resulted from severe reduction of the elongation of individual
   roots, and sub-cluster IIb, in which the shorter TRL resulted from a
   moderate reduction in the elongation of individual roots. Further
   investigation revealed a difference in the composition of these four
   sub-clusters among the four ecotypes, indicating that Aman was the most
   diverse ecotype, followed by Aus. The root traits of these promising
   accessions could be exploited in the future to understand genetic and
   physiological mechanism(s) of adaptation to diverse ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   This paper aims at studying the concept of innovation ecosystems and
   investigating the factors affecting them based on their
   interrelationships with respect to different innovation archetypes.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The methodology is based on using multivariate statistical analysis of
   the inter-correlations among a number of variables which led to
   extracting a reduced set of new significant factors that affect China's
   innovation ecosystem.
   Findings
   The results showed that innovation archetypes differ significantly with
   respect to the majority of the new factors.
   Practical implications
   Through identifying these challenges, decision-makers can develop a
   better understanding of the variables affecting each archetype of
   innovation and act accordingly.
   Originality/value
   The study is the first to fill the gap of addressing a large number of
   variables affecting innovation and analyzing their interrelationships.}},

Title = {{Multiple biomarkers measurement to estimate the duration of atrial
   fibrillation}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF CLINICAL BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{102-107}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background
   An accurate estimation of the duration of atrial fibrillation is
   critical for its safe management. Recent studies suggested that
   copeptin, carbohydrate antigen-125, galectin-3 and growth
   differentiation factor-15 are increased in atrial fibrillation. We
   examined the ability of these markers to identify patients presenting
   with atrial fibrillation of <= 48 versus >48 h duration.
   Methods
   Retrospective analysis of a prospective study that included patients
   with atrial fibrillation of known duration.
   Results
   A total of 98 patients were analysed, 47 with atrial fibrillation <= 48
   h and 51 with >48 h. In patients presenting with atrial fibrillation of
   <= 48 versus >48 h duration, the mean carbohydrate antigen-125
   concentration was 16.9 +/- 12.5 versus 30.9 +/- 36.3 U/mL (P = 0.01),
   and growth differentiation factor-15 concentration was 1320 +/- 889
   versus 2608 +/- 2163 pg/mL (P < 0.001). Copeptin concentration was not
   independently associated with atrial fibrillation duration. The
   galectin-3 concentration did not differ between groups. Area under the
   ROC curve to identify patients with atrial fibrillation <= 48 h was
   0.869 for carbohydrate antigen-125, 0.853 for growth differentiation
   factor-15.
   Conclusion
   The plasma concentrations of carbohydrate antigen-125, growth
   differentiation factor-15 and copeptin, but not galectin-3, are higher
   in patients presenting with atrial fibrillation of >48 h duration than
   in those with atrial fibrillation <= 48 h. The ability to discriminate
   recent atrial fibrillation offered by carbohydrate antigen-125 and
   growth differentiation factor-15 seems high.}},

Abstract = {{Canine mammary carcinoma (CMC) has been used as a model to investigate
   the pathogenesis of human breast cancer and the same grading scheme is
   commonly used to assess tumor malignancy in both. One key component of
   this grading scheme is the density of mitotic figures (MF). Current
   publicly available datasets on human breast cancer only provide
   annotations for small subsets of whole slide images (WSIs). We present a
   novel dataset of 21 WSIs of CMC completely annotated for MF. For this, a
   pathologist screened all WSIs for potential MF and structures with a
   similar appearance. A second expert blindly assigned labels, and for
   non-matching labels, a third expert assigned the final labels.
   Additionally, we used machine learning to identify previously undetected
   MF. Finally, we performed representation learning and two-dimensional
   projection to further increase the consistency of the annotations. Our
   dataset consists of 13,907 MF and 36,379 hard negatives. We achieved a
   mean F1-score of 0.791 on the test set and of up to 0.696 on a human

Abstract = {{An Indian power system is characterized by a conglomeration of
   ultra-high voltage AC and DC, multi-terminal DC, and extra-high voltage
   AC transmission networks. It consists of a large distribution network
   across the country along with conventional generation having Ultra-Mega
   Power Plants (UMPP) and increasing penetration of Renewable Energy
   Sources (RES). The System Integrity and Protection Schemes (SIPS) play
   an important role in maintaining a secure and reliable grid and assists
   in effective grid management during severe power system contingencies.
   This paper presents the operational experience of some SIPS implemented
   in India along with their performance evaluations. The operational
   experience of three important SIPS, one in the Northern Regional (NR)
   grid and another two in the Western Regional (WR) grid of India are
   presented. The drawbacks in existing SIPS are pointed out and an
   algorithm is proposed to overcome these drawbacks. The performance and
   effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are evaluated by simulation
   studies on the 39-bus New England system embedded with an HVDC link in
   MATLAB/Simulink. Simulation results consummated confirm the authenticity
   of the scheme in preserving system integrity. Results are validated
   using Electrical Transient Analyzer Program (ETAP), which is a very
   powerful design and analysis tool and has an extremely user-friendly
   interface.}},

Title = {{Witnessing Parental Violence and Cyber IPV Perpetration in Hispanic
   Emerging Adults: The Mediating Role of Attitudes Toward IPV}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies indicate that the perpetration of intimate partner
   violence via cyberspaces (cyber IPV), namely, psychological aggression,
   sexual aggression, and cyberstalking is high among emerging adults.
   However, little is known of the risk factors that lead to cyber IPV and
   far lesser within Hispanic adults. Based on the intergenerational
   transmission of violence hypothesis, the present study examined the
   indirect effect of witnessing parental violence during childhood on the
   three types of cyber IPV through attitudes condoning IPV in Hispanic men
   and women, separately. Participants were 1,136 Hispanic emerging adults
   in the age range of 18-29 years (M = 20.53 years, SD = 2.42; 72.5\%
   women, 88\% Mexican descent). Over half of the participants (54.2\%)
   witnessed at least one instance of parental violence during childhood.
   In contrast to women, men were more likely to hold attitudes accepting
   of IPV and perpetrate cyber sexual IPV, whereas women were more likely
   to report cyberstalking perpetration. Men and women with exposure to
   mother-to-father violence held attitudes justifying IPV that was
   associated with perpetrating the three cyber IPV types in adulthood
   (women: B-range = .016-.036; men: B-range = .016-.024). No significant
   gender differences were found in the associations of mother-to-father
   WPV and father-to-mother WPV on the three types of cyber IPV
   perpetration. These findings are discussed in the context of Hispanic
   culture, which has specific implications for cyber IPV intervention
   strategies.}},

Title = {{On the inclusion of sustainability and digitalisation in quality
   management - an overview from past to present}},
Journal = {{TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT \& BUSINESS EXCELLENCE}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to explore whether trends in sustainability and
   digitalisation from the 1980s until today have left any significant
   practical or epistemological footprints on the quality management
   paradigm. The study design consists of a mixed-methods approach that
   applies a data-mining methodology and content analysis to the digital
   archives of eight scientific journals: six within the quality management
   (QM) domain and two with a focus on operations management (OM). The data
   set contains an unbroken time series of over 12,000 research paper
   abstracts, the first of them published in 1980, giving the study a
   coverage of almost 40 years. The findings show that sustainability came
   onto the scholarly scene in 1996 and has since become an increasingly
   popular research area. In regard to digitalisation, the story is quite
   different, as the concept is currently absent from the scholarly QM and
   OM literatures. However, a search for information technology (IT) and
   information systems (IS) revealed that these topics have been gaining
   attention since the 1980s. However, it was found that QM research only
   addresses one part of digitalisation, omitting several interesting
   dimensions. One example is that the QM and OM literatures address IS
   mainly in relation to standardised guidelines and business processes
   within organisations. At the same time, we found a handful of studies
   combining QM and topics related to modern digitisation, like social
   media.}},

Abstract = {{This article introduces the Generalized Minimum Branch Vertices problem.
   Given an undirected graph, where the set of vertices is partitioned into
   clusters, the Generalized Minimum Branch Vertices problem consists of
   finding a tree spanning exactly one vertex for each cluster and having
   the minimum number of branch vertices, namely vertices with degree
   greater than two. When each cluster is a singleton, the problem reduces
   to the well-known Minimum Branch Vertices problem, which is NP-hard. We
   show some properties that any feasible solution to the problem has to
   satisfy. Some of these properties can be used to determine useless
   vertices or edges, which can be removed to reduce the size of the
   instances. We propose an integer linear programming formulation for the
   problem, we derive the dimension of the polytope, we study the trivial
   inequalities and introduce two new classes of valid inequalities, that
   are proved to be facet-defining.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to investigate the influence and interaction of

   Response surface method in assistance with the central composite design
   was employed to design the fifteen experiments to find the effect of
   three independent variables (i.e., temperature, equivalence ratio and
   residence time) on the yields of gases, char and tar. The optimum H-2
   production of 41.36 mol \% (15.963 mol kg-MSW-1) was achieved at the
   conditions of 757.65 degrees C, 0.241, and 22.26 min for temperature,
   ER, and residence time respectively. In terms of syngas properties, the
   lower heating value and molar ratio (H-2/CO) ranged between 9.33 and
   12.48 MJ/Nm(3) and 0.45-0.93. The predicted model of statistical
   analysis indicated a good fit with experimental data. The gasification
   of MSW utilizing air as a gasifying agent was found to be an effective

Title = {{A Method to Update Model Kinematic States by Assimilating
   Satellite-Observed Total Lightning Data to Improve Convective Analysis
   and Forecasting}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{NOV 27}},
Abstract = {{This study assesses the benefit of convective-scale data assimilation
   (DA) for model initialization using well-known functional relationships
   between lightning flash rate and vertical velocity. Based on the
   relationships, a lightning DA scheme to update model kinematic states
   was implemented in the Weather Research and Forecasting Data
   Assimilation (WRFDA) three-dimensional variational (3DVar) system. This
   scheme combines total lightning observations with model-based prescribed
   vertical velocity profiles to retrieve kinematic information through a
   DA scheme. With the availability of space-borne lightning imagers in
   recent years, total lightning observations from the Lightning Mapping
   Imager (LMI) on board the FY-4A geostationary satellite were assimilated
   in combination with radar DA. A detailed analysis of the impact of the
   lightning DA scheme on convective precipitation forecasting was
   conducted using a squall line case over Beijing on 13 July 2017. The
   assimilation of LMI data provides added benefits to the assimilation of
   radar radial winds by reducing wind errors and strengthening convergence
   along the squall line in the analysis. Although the microphysical states
   are identical due to the assimilation of reflectivity, the lightning DA
   scheme helps in promoting updraft developments at lightning observation
   locations, which improves the representation of mixed-phase convection.
   The quantitative verification of short-term convective forecasts
   indicated that the lightning DA adds value to the radar DA by improving
   the precipitation forecast skill. The lightning DA scheme was evaluated
   further for a heavy rainfall case in 2018 over the Beijing metropolitan
   area and revealed overall similar forecast improvements for composite
   reflectivity and accumulated rainfall.
   Plain Language Summary Lightning flashes are closely related to the
   upward air motions in thunderstorms and hence are indicative of strong
   wind convergence. Currently, lightning imagers on board the
   geostationary satellites provide increased availability of lightning
   data over broad regions and can improve weather forecasting accuracy.
   This paper describes how the space-borne lightning observations could be
   employed to update model kinematic states and improve convective
   precipitation forecasting.}},

Abstract = {{Methyl siloxanes are becoming increasingly prevalent in the environment
   because of their extensive use in various consumer products. Little is
   known about the distribution of these chemicals around factories or
   their presence in road dust. We conducted a survey of four cyclic
   (D-3-D-6) and 13 linear (L-4-L-16) siloxanes in road dusts around a
   manufacturing site and found a total siloxane concentration range of
   47.3-3.16 x 10(3) ng/g (median 372). The predominant siloxanes in the
   road dust samples were D-3, D-4, D-5, and D-6, with median contributions
   of 65.3\%, 17.9\%, 6.36\%, and 2.16\% of the total siloxane
   concentrations, respectively. Our reported concentrations were
   comparable to those found in household dusts in previous studies. No
   high concentrations of siloxanes were observed in the road dust samples
   from the manufacturing site, which suggests that siloxanes in outdoor
   dusts are likely affected by many factors. Under a high exposure
   scenario, the daily intakes of total siloxanes via road dust ingestion
   at the 95th percentile were 2.13 and 0.313 ng/kg-bw/day for children and
   adults, respectively. Although the estimated exposure to siloxanes in
   outdoor dust for humans was low, more studies on the distributions and
   risks of siloxanes released from manufacturing sites are needed.}},

Abstract = {{The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N8 virus has been
   detected in wild birds and poultry worldwide. The threat caused by HPAI
   H5N8 virus still exists with concerns for human infection. The
   preparedness for epidemic prevention and decreasing the agricultural and
   economic lost is extremely important. Hemagglutinin (HA), a surface
   glycoprotein of influenza viruses, is considered as the major target for
   detection of the influenza virus subtype in the infected samples. In
   this study, the recombinant H5N8 HA1 and HA2 proteins were expressed in
   Escherichia coli, and were utilized to generate two monoclonal
   antibodies, named 7H6C and YC8. 7H6C can bind the HA proteins of H5N1
   and H5N8, but cannot bind the HA proteins of H1N1, H3N2, and H7N9,
   indicating that it has H5-subtype specificity. In contrast, YC8 can bind
   the HA proteins of H1N1, H5N1, and H5N8, but cannot bind the HA proteins
   of H3N2 and H7N9, indicating that it has H1-subtype and H5-subtype
   specificity. The epitope sequences recognized by 7H6C are located in the
   head domain of H5N8 HA, and are highly conserved in H5 subtypes. The
   epitope sequences recognized by YC8 are located in the stalk domain of
   H5N8 HA, and are highly conserved among the H1 and H5 subtypes. 7H6C and
   YC8 can be applied for specific detection of the HA proteins of H5N8 and
   H5Nx avian influenza viruses.}},

Title = {{Dream Generation and Recall in Daytime NREM Sleep of Patients With
   Narcolepsy Type 1}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{NOV 27}},
Abstract = {{The less rigid architecture of sleep in patients with narcolepsy type 1
   (NT1) compared with healthy subjects may provide new insights into some
   unresolved issues of dream experience (DE), under the assumption that
   their DE frequencies are comparable. The multiple transition from
   wakefulness to REM sleep (sleep onset REM period: SOREMP) during the
   five trials of the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) appears of
   particular interest. In MSLT studies, NT1 patients reported a DE after
   about 80\% of SOREMP naps (as often as after nighttime REM sleep of
   themselves and healthy subjects), but only after about 30\% of NREM naps
   compared to 60\% of daytime and nighttime NREM sleep of healthy
   subjects. To estimate accurately the ``real{''} DE frequency, we asked
   participants to report DE ({''}dream{''}) after each MSLT nap and, in
   case of failure, to specify if they were unable to retrieve any content
   ({''}white dream{''}) or DE did not occur ({''}no-dream{''}). The
   proportions of dreams, white dreams, and no dreams and the indicators of
   structural organization of DEs reported after NREM naps by 17 adult NT1
   patients were compared with those reported by 25 subjects with
   subjective complaints of excessive daytime sleepiness (sc-EDS), who take
   multiple daytime NREM naps. Findings were consistent with the hypothesis
   of a failure in recall after awakening rather than in generation during
   sleep: white dreams were more frequent in NT1 patients than in sc-EDS
   subjects (42.86 vs 17.64\%), while their frequency of dreams plus white
   dreams were similar (67.86 and 61.78\%) and comparable with that of
   NREM-DEs in healthy subjects. The longer and more complex NREM-DEs of
   NT1 patients compared with sc-EDS subjects suggest that the difficulty
   in DE reporting depends on their negative attitude toward recall of
   contents less vivid and bizarre than those they usually retrieve after
   daytime SOREMP and nighttime REM sleep. As this attitude may be reversed
   by some recall training before MSLT, collecting wider amounts of DE
   reports after NREM naps would cast light on both the across-stage
   continuity in the functioning of cognitive processes underlying DE and
   the difference in content and structural organization of SOREM-DEs
   preceded by N1 or also N2 sleep.}},

Title = {{Implementing Neuromarketing in the Enterprise: Factors That Impact the
   Adoption of Neuromarketing in Major Spanish Corporations}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN COMMUNICATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 27}},
Abstract = {{Technological advances in the field of neuroscience have generally been
   well-received in the entertainment and advertising industries, where
   there are great commercial benefits linked to knowing the most intimate
   aspects of how audiences and consumers respond to different messages.
   Despite this interest in the results of neuroscience research, large
   enterprises seem to resist implementing them in their marketing
   activities, thus limiting the development of the discipline. This
   research reflects on the main factors that impact the adoption of
   neuromarketing within large-scale enterprises, both from a
   bibliographical and an empirical perspective. This review included
   ethical, economic, professional, technological, and cultural aspects. A
   review of secondary sources was undertaken to understand the current
   state of neuromarketing and its place within large-scale enterprises.
   This review suggested that a series of internal and external factors may
   be limiting its adoption, including organizational culture, lack of
   knowledge and training, uncertainty about its results and/or concerns
   about the cost of this methodology. To validate the results of the
   bibliographical research, a structured, self-administered online
   questionnaire was designed to be distributed amongst a senior decision
   makers within large companies in Spain. The aims of this survey were to
   diagnose the level to which major corporations in Spain are aware of and
   employ neuromarketing; and to identify the internal and external factors
   that may be limiting or driving its rate of adoption. Before running a
   full-scale study, a pilot test was undertaken to, among others, validate
   the sampling methods and survey distribution strategy and to measure the
   impact of some major challenges that had been identified during survey
   design. The pilot study did succeed in reaching highly qualified
   respondents, but its low response rate highlighted a major issue in the
   research design: the sampling method cannot scale efficiently. A full
   review of the sampling strategy and survey distribution method is needed
   before a full-scale study can be launched. The data gathered in the
   pilot study can't be considered representative or statistically valid;
   they are, at best, preliminary findings that will need to be validated
   by further research. The responses do suggest that neuromarketing
   techniques are not used in the majority of large Spanish companies and
   that the general level of knowledge on the subject is not very high. The
   results also suggest that neuromarketing has a good reputation amongst
   industry practitioners and that, if current trends are confirmed, its
   adoption will increase significantly in the future. The main factors
   that would drive the adoption of neuromarketing are the culture of
   innovation of the companies themselves and the direct alignment of
   neuromarketing techniques to the market research needs on the company.
   Further research in this area should take into account the learnings
   provided by this pilot.}},

   that received BA financing and 216 in the propensity score matched
   control group). Building on insights drawn from the resource-based view
   and absorptive capacity theory, we find that BAs with entrepreneurial
   experience positively affect the sales growth of gazelles only.
   Moreover, the role of BAs' investment experience and coaching in the
   growth rates of both gazelles and ponies is insignificant.
   Interestingly, monitoring helps boost ponies' performance but stifles

Title = {{Giacomo Balla: A Painter in the Context of Neuroscience}},
Journal = {{NEUROSCIENTIST}},
Abstract = {{Giacomo Balla, a famous Italian Futurist painter, was a great observer
   of both human motion and emotion. He showed a profound interest toward
   neurophysiological and neurological sciences. During his search of his
   personal artistic style, he attended the lessons of Cesare Lombroso, a
   criminal anthropologist, who at the time was also professor of neurology
   at the University of Turin. Some years later, he became a close friend
   of Doctor Francesco Ghilarducci, who had spent a few years in Paris at
   Jean-Martin Charcot's ``School.{''} Balla spent most of his career
   studying the dynamics of movement and speed. Some of his most famous
   paintings were inspired by photographic studies on the locomotor system,
   such as those of the French physiologist etienne-Jules Marey. His
   personal painting style reveals his deep interest in neurosciences. We
   hereby illustrate the role of some of Giacomo Balla's paintings as

Title = {{Associations Between Maternal Community Deprivation and Infant DNA
   Methylation of the SLC6A4 Gene}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 27}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Poverty is negatively associated with health and
   developmental outcomes. DNA methylation (DNAm) has been proposed as a
   mechanism that underlies the association between adversity experienced
   by mothers in poverty and health and developmental outcomes in their
   offspring. Previous studies have identified associations between
   individual-level measures of stress and adversity experienced by a
   mother during pregnancy and infant DNAm. We hypothesized that
   independent of individual stresses, a mother's community-level
   deprivation while she is pregnant may also be associated with DNAm among
   the genes of her offspring that are related to stress response and/or
   development.
   Methods: Pregnant mothers (N = 53) completed assessments that measured
   stress, adversity, and mental health. To evaluate community-level
   deprivation, mothers' addresses were linked to census-level
   socioeconomic measures including a composite index of deprivation that
   combines multiple community-level indicators such as income and highest
   level of education received. Infant buccal cells were collected at about
   age 4 weeks to measure DNAm of candidate genes including NR3C1, SCG5,
   and SLC6A4, which are associated with the stress response and or social
   and emotional development. Multivariable models were employed to
   evaluate the association between maternal community deprivation and
   infant DNAm of candidate genes.
   Results: No significant associations were identified between maternal
   community-level deprivation and the methylation of NR3C1 or SCG5,
   however, maternal community-level deprivation was significantly
   associated with higher mean methylation across 8 CpG sites in SLC6A4.
   Conclusion: This study identified an association between community-level
   measures of deprivation experienced by a mother during pregnancy and
   DNAm in their offspring. These findings may have implications for
   understanding how the community context can impact early biology and
   potential function in the next generation.}},

Abstract = {{New structures of ionic liquids have been studied as liquid organic
   hydrogen carriers. The hydrogenation of organosilicon compounds
   containing a carbazole fragment was carried out for the first time. The
   N-(CH2)(3)-Si fragment in the composition of the hydrogen carrier based
   on organosilicon moieties was found to be more suitable than the
   N-CH2-Si bond. Ionic liquids with a carbazole fragment containing
   silicon atoms were synthesized for the first time. It was possible to
   significantly reduce the melting point of such ionic liquids introducing
   an organosilicon linker between carbazole nitrogen and imidazolium ion.
   The synthesized ionic liquid is a liquid at room temperature.
   Hydrogenation-dehydrogenation experiments demonstrated that such ionic
   liquids are thermally stable up to at least 220 and nearly quantitative
   conversion can be achieved. Both the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation
   processes were carried out using the same Pd/C catalyst. The theoretical
   total gravimetric hydrogen capacities for synthesized ionic liquids are
   2.05\% and 1.58\%. (c) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published

Title = {{A Mixed-method Study of the Effects of Post-migration Economic Stressors
   on the Mental Health of Recently Resettled Refugees}},
Journal = {{SOCIETY AND MENTAL HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{After years of emphasis on pre-migration trauma as the major determinant
   of refugee mental health, researchers have begun to explore the effects
   of post-migration stressors on refugees' distress. However, few studies
   have brought together refugees' emic understandings of the effects of
   economic stressors on their mental health with quantitative data sets to
   further explore the salience of stress processes as an explanatory
   mechanism. In qualitative interviews, 41 percent of 290 recently
   resettled adult refugees noted that economic stressors were a major
   source of distress and described pathways through which these stressors
   negatively influenced their mental health by limiting their ability to
   learn English, obtain meaningful employment, access health care,
   maintain contact with their families, and integrate into their
   communities. In structural equation modeling of quantitative data, we
   tested several possible hypotheses that emerged from the qualitative
   findings. We find that post-migration economic stressors mediated the
   relationship between migration-related trauma and post-migration
   emotional distress and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.
   These findings provide empirical support for stress proliferation as a
   mechanism through which trauma exposure contributes to distress.}},

Abstract = {{Children with autism spectrum disorder often have significant language
   delays. But do they learn language differently than neurotypical
   toddlers? We compared the lexical skills of 64 preverbal and minimally
   verbal children with autism spectrum disorder to 461
   vocabulary-size-matched typically developing toddlers. We also examined
   social features of verb knowledge using a novel collection of social
   ratings. Children with autism spectrum disorder produced proportionally
   more verbs than typically developing toddlers. Children with autism
   spectrum disorder produced proportionally more action and food words,
   while typically developing toddlers produced proportionally more animal,
   people words, and animal sounds and sound effects. Children with autism
   spectrum disorder also produced ``mommy{''} and ``daddy{''} at lower
   rates. We discuss how these differences may reflect an association
   between lexical development and weaknesses in social communication.
   Lay abstract
   Although preverbal and minimally verbal children with autism spectrum
   disorder represent a significant portion of the autism spectrum disorder
   population, we have a limited understanding of and characterization of
   them. Although it is a given that their lexical profiles contain fewer
   words, it is important to determine whether (a) the words preverbal and
   minimally verbal children with autism spectrum disorder produce are
   similar to the first words typically developing children produce or (b)
   there are unique features of the limited words that preverbal and
   minimally verbal children with autism spectrum disorder produce. The
   current study compared the early word profiles of preverbal and
   minimally verbal children with autism spectrum disorder to
   vocabulary-matched typically developing toddlers. Children with autism
   spectrum disorder produced proportionally more verbs than typically
   developing toddlers. Also, children with autism spectrum disorder
   produced proportionally more action and food words, while typically
   developing toddlers produced proportionally more animal words, animal
   sounds and sound effects, and people words. Children with autism
   spectrum disorder also produced ``mommy{''} and ``daddy{''} at lower
   rates. Our findings identified several areas of overlap in early word
   learning; however, our findings also point to differences that may be
   connected to core weaknesses in social communication (i.e. people
   words). The findings highlight words and categories that could serve as
   useful targets for communication intervention with preverbal and
   minimally verbal children with autism spectrum disorder.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical method was developed for optimising solar-hydrogen energy
   system to supply renewable energy for typical household connected with
   the grid. The considered case study involved household located in Diyala
   Governorate, Iraq. The solar-hydrogen energy system was designed to meet
   the desired electrical load and increase the renewable energy fraction
   using optimum fuel cell capacity. The simulation process was conducted
   by MATLAB based on the experimental data for electrical load, solar
   radiation and ambient temperature at a 1-min time-step resolution.
   Results demonstrated that the optimum fuel cell capacity was
   approximately 2.25 kW at 1.8 kW photovoltaic power system based on the
   average of the daily energy consumption of 6.8 kWh. The yearly renewable
   energy fraction increased from 31.82\% to 95.82\% due to the integration
   of the photovoltaic system with a 2.25 kW fuel cell used as a robust
   energy storage unit. In addition, the energy supply, which is the
   economic aspect for the optimum system, levelised electricity cost by
   approximately \$0.195/kWh. The obtained results showed that the proposed
   numerical analysis methodology offers a distinctive property that can be
   used effectively to optimise hybrid renewable energy systems. (c) 2020

Abstract = {{We intend to examine whether behavioral and mental health-related
   determinants including stress level, daytime sleepiness, sleep
   disorders, smoking, drinking, physical activity, and vegetable intake
   were associated with severity of jet lag and symptoms of jet lag. We
   delivered a survey to All Nippon Airways HOLDINGS (ANA) customers in
   Japan and U.S. asking for their lifestyle information, subjective jet
   lag perceptions, and symptoms of jet lag, and obtained a sample of 1759
   Japanese and 483 U.S. participants. Multivariate linear regression
   analysis showed a positive association between severity of jet lag
   perception and sleep disorders (Model 2: {[}b = 0.43, 95\% CI 0.25;
   0.61]), but a negative association between severe jet lag perception and
   both smoking (Model 2: {[}b = - 0.15, 95\% CI - 0.30; - 0.00]) and
   physical activity (Model 2: {[}b = - 0.15, 95\% CI - 0.28; - 0.02]).
   Regarding jet lag symptoms, it revealed a positive association between
   higher jet lag symptoms and perceived stress (Model 2: {[}b = 0.32, 95\%
   CI 0.16; 0.47]), sleep disorder (Model 2: {[}b = 0.32, 95\% CI 0.19;
   0.44]), and vegetable consumption (Model 2: {[}b = 0.09, 95\% CI 0.00;
   0.17]). The results varied for other lifestyle factors, including
   smoking, physical activity, vegetable intake, and alcohol consumption.
   Given the health risks among business travelers, this preliminary
   analysis showed the possible importance of developing evidence-based jet
   lag prevention strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigated the effect of maceration of different
   species of wood (oak, acacia, chestnut, apricot, mulberry, plum, cherry

   color and sensory acceptability of the wine spirit. The addition of
   different kinds of wooden fragments to the wine spirit led to increased
   content of compounds with antioxidant capacity in the spirit. The
   highest level of antioxidant capacity was found in the spirit aging with
   an addition of wooden fragments of chestnut tree. Samples of spirits
   containing wood fragments treated at a lower temperature reached higher
   concentration of compounds with antioxidant capacity. The determined
   total content of polyphenols in spirit is correlated with antioxidant
   capacity values. Sensory analysis revealed statistically significant
   difference only in color, smoke aroma, smoke taste, overall quality and
   flavor persistence. The other sensory parameters of spirits observed did

Abstract = {{Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is started from Wuhan (City in China), and
   is rapidly spreading among people living in other countries. Today,
   around 215 countries are affected by COVID-19 disease. WHO announced
   approximately number of cases 11,274,600 worldwide. Due to rapidly
   rising cases daily in the hospitals, there are a limited number of
   resources available to control COVID-19 disease. Therefore, it is
   essential to develop an accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. Early
   diagnosis of COVID-19 patients is important for preventing the disease
   from spreading to others. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning
   based approach that can differentiate COVID- 19 disease patients from
   viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, and healthy (normal) cases. In
   this approach, deep transfer learning is adopted. We used binary and
   multi-class dataset which is categorized in four types for
   experimentation: (i) Collection of 728 X-ray images including 224 images
   with confirmed COVID-19 disease and 504 normal condition images (ii)
   Collection of 1428 X-ray images including 224 images with confirmed
   COVID-19 disease, 700 images with confirmed common bacterial pneumonia,
   and 504 normal condition images. (iii) Collections of 1442 X- ray images
   including 224 images with confirmed COVID-19 disease, 714 images with
   confirmed bacterial and viral pneumonia, and 504 images of normal
   conditions (iv) Collections of 5232 X- ray images including 2358 images
   with confirmed bacterial and 1345 with viral pneumonia, and 1346 images
   of normal conditions. In this paper, we have used nine convolutional
   neural network based architecture (AlexNet, GoogleNet, ResNet-50,
   Se-ResNet-50, DenseNet121, Inception V4, Inception ResNet V2,
   ResNeXt-50, and Se-ResNeXt-50). Experimental results indicate that the
   pre trained model Se-ResNeXt-50 achieves the highest classification
   accuracy of 99.32\% for binary class and 97.55\% for multi-class among
   all pre-trained models.}},

   koraiensis}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 27}},
Abstract = {{The larch adelgid Adelges laricis laricis Vallot is a specialist insect
   parasite of Picea koraiensis (Korean spruce) and forms fish scale-like
   galls that damage the growth of the host plants. Our investigation
   reveals that both these galls and the fruits (cones) of P. koraiensis
   display lower concentrations of phytosynthetic pigments and accumulate
   anthocyanin cyanidin-3-O-glucoside and soluble sugars in the mature
   stages. Interestingly, high concentrations of 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP)
   both in the cauline gall tissues and in the larch adelgids themselves
   (4064.61 +/- 167.83 and 3655.42 +/- 210.29 ng/g FW, respectively),
   suggested that this vital phytohormone may be synthesized by the insects
   to control the development of gall tissues. These results indicate that
   the galls and cones are sink organs, and the development of gall tissues
   is possibly regulated by phytohormones in a way similar to that of the
   growth of cones. The concentrations of phytohormones related to growth
   {[}indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), cytokinins (CTK), and gibberellins (GAs)]
   and defense {[}salicylic acid (SA)], as well as SA-related phenolics
   {[}benzoic acid (BA) and p-hydroxybenzoic acid (pHBA)] in gall tissues
   were positively correlated with those in cones during the development
   stage. The levels of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) in the
   developmental stage of the cones correlates negatively with their
   concentrations in the gall tissues (R = -0.92, p < 0.001), suggesting
   that downregulation of ACC might be the reason why galls are not
   abscised after a year. Our results provide a new perspective on the
   potential mechanism of the development of cauline galls on P.
   koraiensis, which are regulated by phytohormones.}},

Title = {{Evaluating the Toxicity of Ionic Liquids on Shewanella sp. for Designing
   Sustainable Bioprocesses}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 27}},
Abstract = {{Ionic liquids (ILs) are widely used as reaction and separation media in
   many technologies due to their unique and advantageous physicochemical
   properties. Thus, further studies approaching the study of the toxicity
   of these materials are required. Moreover, they are utilized in devices
   in which microorganisms such as Shewanella sp. act as biocatalysts.
   Thus, in this work, the toxicity of 69 ILs on the marine bacterium
   Shewanella sp. was tested. Specifically, the ILs analyzed were based on
   the cations imidazolium, pyridinium, pyrrolidinium, piperidinium,
   morpholinium, oxazolinium, phosphonium, ammonium, and sulfonium, in
   combination with different anions. The toxicities of this wide group of
   ILs on Shewanella sp. were determined using two methods: 1) the agar
   disk-diffusion test and 2) the growth inhibition test in liquid media.
   The relationship between toxicity and IL chemical structure was
   elucidated. A decrease in the hydrophobicity of the alkyl chain length
   was found to be a key factor to reduce IL toxicity. On the other hand,
   phosphonium-based ILs containing long alkyl chains were shown to be
   largely incompatible with Shewanella sp.}},

Title = {{Recommendations for treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19
   Version 3 S1 guideline}},
Journal = {{ANAESTHESIST}},
Abstract = {{Since December 2019 a novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory
   syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread around the world
   resulting in an acute respiratory illness pandemic. The immense
   challenges for clinicians and hospitals as well as the strain on many
   healthcare systems has been unprecedented.
   The majority of patients present with mild symptoms of coronavirus
   disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, 5-8\% become critically ill and
   require intensive care treatment. Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure
   with severe dyspnea and an increased respiratory rate (>30/min) usually
   leads to intensive care unit (ICU) admission. At this point bilateral
   pulmonary infiltrates are typically seen. Patients often develop a
   severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
   So far, remdesivir and dexamethasone have shown clinical effectiveness
   in severe COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. The main goal of supportive
   treatment is to ascertain adequate oxygenation. Invasive mechanical
   ventilation and repeated prone positioning are key elements in treating
   severely hypoxemic COVID-19 patients.
   Strict adherence to basic infection control measures (including hand
   hygiene) and correct use of personal protection equipment (PPE) are
   essential in the care of patients. Procedures that lead to formation of
   aerosols should be carried out with utmost precaution and preparation.}},

Abstract = {{Background and aims: Intentional weight loss may reduce symptom severity
   of atrial fibrillation (AF) in relatively young AF patients with
   overweight. We examined whether symptom severity and quality of life
   (QoL) are associated with weight status in the general population with
   AF.
   Methods and results: Patients with electrocardiogram-confirmed AF
   completed validated questionnaires: the EuroQol 5 Dimensions QoL
   questionnaire and the Toronto Atrial Fibrillation Severity Scale (AFSS).
   The AFSS assessed the AF burden scoring on AF-related symptoms and the
   total AF burden measured as a combination of duration, frequency, and
   severity of an irregular heartbeat. Generalized liner models examined
   the association of body mass index (BMI) with AF severity and QoL
   adjusting for confounders. Between 2018 and 2019, 882 of 1901 (46\%)
   mailed questionnaires were returned completed. Participants had a mean
   (SD) age of 74 (10) years old and a BMI of 27.4 (5.6) kg/m(2). Sixteen
   percent reported having never experienced an irregular heartbeat. A 5
   kg/m(2) higher BMI was associated with a 0.65 (95\%CI: 0.25 to 1.06)
   higher symptom score, where 3 points represent a clinically relevant
   change in state. A 5 kg/m(2) higher BMI was associated with a -1.61
   (95\%CI: -2.72 to -0.50) lower QoL score. The coefficient of the total
   AF burden for a 5 kg/m(2) higher BMI was 0.17 (95\% CI: -0.01 to 0.68).
   Conclusion: BMI was positively associated with symptoms and negatively
   associated with one of the two measures of QoL, but not with the total
   AF burden. However, the strength of association was small and not
   clinically meaningful. (C) 2020 The Italian Diabetes Society, the

Abstract = {{Background Testosterone administration was found to have a protective
   effect on thyroid autoimmunity in men with autoimmune (Hashimoto's)
   thyroiditis. Objective The present study was aimed at assessing whether
   oral dehydroepiandrosterone affects thyroid autoimmunity and
   hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis activity in men with subclinical
   hypothyroidism induced by Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Setting The study was
   conducted at Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland. Method The
   study enrolled 32 elderly men with autoimmune hypothyroidism and low
   dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate levels. Based on patient preference, the
   participants either received oral dehydroepiandrosterone (50 mg daily; n
   = 16) or remained untreated (n = 16). Apart from measuring antibody
   titers and hormone levels, we calculated baseline and post-treatment
   values of three structure parameters of thyroid homeostasis. Main
   outcome measure Serum titers of thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin
   antibodies. Results At baseline, there were no significant differences
   in the investigated parameters between both groups of men. All
   participants completed the study. Oral dehydroepiandrosterone increased
   dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate and testosterone levels, as well as had a
   neutral effect on estradiol levels. The increase in
   dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate correlated with treatment-induced changes
   in serum testosterone. Moreover, dehydroepiandrosterone reduced titers
   of thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies, decreased serum
   thyrotropin levels, reduced Jostel's thyrotropin index as well as
   increased thyroid's secretory capacity. Treatment-induced changes in
   thyroid antibody titers, thyrotropin levels, Jostel's thyrotropin index
   and thyroid's secretory capacity correlated with the increase in

Title = {{The role of cortisol in ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke, type 2
   diabetes, and cardiovascular disease risk factors: a bi-directional
   Mendelian randomization study}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICINE}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Background Cortisol, a steroid hormone frequently used as a biomarker of
   stress, is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2
   diabetes mellitus (T2DM). To clarify whether cortisol causes these
   outcomes, we assessed the role of cortisol in ischemic heart disease
   (IHD), ischemic stroke, T2DM, and CVD risk factors using a
   bi-directional Mendelian randomization (MR) study. Methods Single
   nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) strongly (P < 5 x 10(-6)) and
   independently (r(2) < 0.001) predicting cortisol were obtained from the
   CORtisol NETwork (CORNET) consortium (n = 12,597) and two metabolomics
   genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (n = 7824 and n = 2049). They
   were applied to GWAS of the primary outcomes (IHD, ischemic stroke and
   T2DM) and secondary outcomes (adiposity, glycemic traits, blood pressure
   and lipids) to obtain estimates using inverse variance weighting, with
   weighted median, MR-Egger, and MR-PRESSO as sensitivity analyses.
   Conversely, SNPs predicting IHD, ischemic stroke, and T2DM were applied
   to the cortisol GWAS. Results Genetically predicted cortisol (based on 6
   SNPs from CORNET; F-statistic = 28.3) was not associated with IHD (odds
   ratio (OR) 0.98 per 1 unit increase in log-transformed cortisol, 95\%
   confidence interval (CI) 0.93-1.03), ischemic stroke (0.99, 95\% CI
   0.91-1.08), T2DM (1.00, 95\% CI 0.96-1.04), or CVD risk factors.
   Genetically predicted IHD, ischemic stroke, and T2DM were not associated
   with cortisol. Conclusions Contrary to observational studies,
   genetically predicted cortisol was unrelated to IHD, ischemic stroke,
   T2DM, or CVD risk factors, or vice versa. Our MR results find no
   evidence that cortisol plays a role in cardiovascular risk, casting
   doubts on the cortisol-related pathway, although replication is
   warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Background: This study investigated the safety and efficacy of a new
   cooling device for use in minimal-incision kidney trans- plantation
   (MIKT).
   Material/Methods: From June 2016 to December 2021, 9 patients underwent
   MIKT surgery in our hospitals using the new cooling device to maintain
   hypothermia. We recorded and analyzed information on the etiology,
   comorbid status, ongoing renal replacement assessment, BMI, FILA
   mismatching sites of donors and recipients, and perioperative and
   postoperative clinical data for recipients.
   Results: Kidney transplantation was successfully performed in all
   patients. The kidney surface temperature measure- ment results showed
   that the intraoperative renal anterior and posterior surface
   temperatures were stable at approximately 3.8 +/- 1.2 degrees C and 5.2
   +/- 1.3 degrees C, respectively, during ice-water circulation. The mean
   operation time was 112 +/- 15 min, the artery anastomosis time was 16
   +/- 6.0 min, and the vein anastomosis time was 14 +/- 4.5 min. All
   recipients recovered uneventfully. The patients were followed up for
   6-30 months. Urinary and vascular complications were not found in any
   recipients.
   Conclusions: The new cooling device can facilitate MIKT. It is safe and
   feasible to carry out MIKT using the new cooling device, which can
   reduce surgical trauma and improve the quality of vascular anastomosis
   with satisfactory cosmetic results.}},

   in order to comprehensively understand their historical progress and
   current situation, as well as future development trend.
   Design/methodology/approach First, this paper describes the fundamental
   information of these publications on PFSs, including their data
   information, annual trend and prediction and basic features. Second, the
   most productive and influential authors, countries/regions, institutions
   and the most cited documents are presented in the form of evaluation
   indicators. Third, with the help of VOSviewer software, the
   visualization analysis is conducted to show the development status of
   PFSs publications at the level of authors, countries/regions,
   institutions and keywords. Finally, the burst detection of keywords,
   timezone review and timeline review are exported from CiteSpace software
   to analyze the hotspots and development trend on PFSs. Findings The
   annual PFSs publications present a quickly increasing trend. The most
   productive author is Wei Guiwu (China). Wei Guiwu and Wei Cun have the
   strongest cooperative relationship. Research limitations/implications
   The implication of this study is to provide a comprehensive perspective
   for the scholars who take a fancy to PFSs, and it is valuable for
   scholars to grasp the hotspots in this field in time. Originality/value
   It is the first paper that uses the bibliometric analysis to
   comprehensively analyze the publications on PFSs. It can help the
   scholars in the field of PFSs to quickly understand the development
   status and trend of PFSs.}},

Abstract = {{The vibrational spectra of cyclo{[}18]carbon and its analogues,
   cyclo{[}2n]carbon (n=3 to 15), were carefully simulated and
   characterized. The in-plane C-C stretching vibrations shows strong
   rigidity, while out-of-plane motions seem to be extremely flexible. The
   solvation effect can enhance signal strengths of the vibrational
   spectra, but does not evidently change the shape of the spectral curves.
   The infrared and Raman spectra of cyclo{[}2n]carbons are quite sensitive
   to ring size in the range of n=3 to 7, while the size only modestly
   affects peak positions and strengths for larger rings. Molecular dynamic
   trajectories show that the fluctuation period of the skeleton of
   cyclo{[}18]carbon is basically constant at different temperatures, and
   they are all about 300 fs. With increase of simulation temperature, the
   ring distortion due to thermal motion is notable and becomes much
   stronger. However, neither ring breaking nor isomerization in
   cyclo{[}18]carbon is observed during the simulations untill 298.15 K.}},

Abstract = {{The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe
   acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has posed serious
   threats to global health and economy, thus calling for the development
   of safe and effective vaccines. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the
   spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for its binding to
   angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. It contains multiple
   dominant neutralizing epitopes and serves as an important antigen for
   the development of COVID-19 vaccines. Here, we showed that immunization
   of mice with a candidate subunit vaccine consisting of SARS-CoV-2 RBD
   and Fc fragment of human IgG, as an immunopotentiator, elicited high
   titer of RBD-specific antibodies with robust neutralizing activity
   against both pseudotyped and live SARS-CoV-2 infections. The mouse
   antisera could also effectively neutralize infection by pseudotyped
   SARS-CoV-2 with several natural mutations in RBD and the IgG extracted
   from the mouse antisera could also show neutralization against
   pseudotyped SARS-CoV and SARS-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV).
   Vaccination of human ACE2 transgenic mice with RBD-Fc could effectively
   protect mice from the SARS-CoV-2 challenge. These results suggest that
   SARS-CoV-2 RBD-Fc has good potential to be further developed as an
   effective and broad-spectrum vaccine to prevent infection of the current
   SARS-CoV-2 and its mutants, as well as future emerging SARSr-CoVs and
   re-emerging SARS-CoV.}},

Abstract = {{Background Given that there is no rapid and effective method for
   distinguishing active tuberculosis (ATB) from latent tuberculosis
   infection (LTBI), the discrimination between these two statuses remains
   challenging. This study sought to investigate the value of nutritional
   indexes and tuberculosis-specific antigen/phytohemagglutinin ratio
   (TBAg/PHA ratio) for distinguishing ATB from LTBI.
   Methods Participants were consecutively recruited based on positive
   T-SPOT.TB results between January 2018 and January 2020. ATB was
   diagnosed by positive mycobacterial culture and/or positive GeneXpert
   MTB/RIF, with clinical symptoms and radiological characteristics
   suggestive of ATB. Individuals with positive T-SPOT.TB but without the
   evidence of ATB were defined as LTBI. Patients younger than 17 years and
   undergoing anti-TB treatment were excluded.
   Results A total of 709 (312 ATB and 397 LTBI) and another 309 (120 ATB
   and 189 LTBI) subjects were respectively recruited from Tongji Hospital
   (Qiaokou cohort) and Sino-French New City Hospital (Caidian cohort). The
   level of prealbumin was significantly lower in ATB than in LTBI. With a
   cut-off value of 139 mg/L, the sensitivity and specificity of prealbumin
   in distinguishing ATB from LTBI were 50.96\% (45.41\%-56.51\%) and
   91.69\% (88.97\%-94.40\%). Meanwhile, TBAg/PHA ratio was found
   statistically higher in ATB compared with LTBI. If using the threshold
   of 0.29, the sensitivity and specificity of TBAg/PHA ratio were 65.71\%
   (60.44\%-70.97\%) and 90.93\% (88.11\%-93.76\%), respectively. Moreover,
   the combination of prealbumin and TBAg/PHA ratio (obtaining by
   diagnostic model) yielded better specificity (90.18\%,
   {[}87.25\%-93.10\%]) and sensitivity (87.18\%, {[}83.47\%-90.89\%]),
   while the clinical utility index (CUI) positive and CUI negative were
   respectively 0.76 and 0.81. After anti-TB treatment, TBAg/PHA ratio was
   declined while the level of prealbumin was restored (Wilcoxon test, P <
   0.001). Furthermore, the performance of diagnostic model obtained in
   Qiaokou cohort was confirmed in Caidian cohort.
   Conclusions The diagnostic model based on combination of prealbumin and
   TBAg/PHA ratio is a rapid and accurate tool for discriminating ATB from
   LTBI.}},

Title = {{The structural similarity index for IMRT quality assurance:
   radiomics-based error classification}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The implementation of radiomics and machine learning (ML)
   techniques on analyzing two-dimensional gamma maps has been demonstrated
   superior to the conventional gamma analysis for error identification in
   intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) quality assurance (QA).
   Recently, the Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) sub-index maps were shown to
   be able to reveal the error types of the dose distributions. In this
   study, we aimed to apply radiomics analysis on SSIM sub-index maps and
   develop ML models to classify delivery errors in patient-specific
   dynamic IMRT QA.
   Methods: Twenty-one sliding-window IMRT plans of 180 beams for three
   treatment sites were involved in this study. Four types of
   machine-related errors of various magnitudes were simulated for each
   beam at each control point, including the monitor unit (MU) variations,
   same-directional and opposite-directional shifts of the multileaf
   collimators (MLCs) and random mispositioning of the MLCs. In the QA
   process, a total of 1620 portal dose (PD) images were acquired for the
   beams with and without errors. The predicted PD images of the original
   beams were set as references. To quantify the agreement between a
   measured PD image and the corresponding predicted PD image, four
   difference maps including three SSIM sub-index maps, and one dose
   difference-derived map were calculated. Then, radiomic features were
   extracted from the four difference maps of each measured PD image. We
   tested four typical classifiers including linear discriminant classifier
   (LDC), two supporting vector machine (SVM) classifiers, and random
   forest (RF) for this multiclass classification task. A nested
   cross-validation scheme was used for model evaluations, where the SVM
   recursive feature elimination method was applied for feature selection.
   Finally, the performance of the ML model on identifying the error-free
   and the erroneous cases was compared to that of the conventional gamma
   analysis.
   Results: The statistics of the selected features showed that all of the
   difference maps and the feature categories made balanced contributions
   to solve this classification task. Best performance was achieved by the
   Linear-SVM model with average overall classification accuracy of 0.86.
   Specifically, the average classification accuracies of the shift,
   opening, and the random errors were around 0.9. Moreover, similar to
   80\% of error-free and MU errors were correctly classified. Using gamma
   analysis, the 3 mm/3\% criterion was found insensitive to errors
   (sensitivity was only 0.33). Although the sensitivity to errors with the
   2 mm/2\% criterion increased to 0.79, still 8\% worse than that of the
   ML model.
   Conclusions: We proposed an ML-based method for machine-related error
   identification in patient-specific dynamic IMRT QA, where radiomic
   analysis on SSIM sub-index maps were used for feature extraction. With
   extensive validation to select the best features and classifiers, high
   accuracies in error classification were achieved. Compared with the
   conventional gamma threshold method, this approach has great potential
   in error identification for the patient-specific IMRT QA process. (c)

Title = {{Experimental Study on Desorption Characteristics of Coalbed Methane
   under Variable Loading and Temperature in Deep and High Geothermal Mine}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{NOV 27}},
Abstract = {{Due to the influence of deep high stress, geothermal heat, and other
   factors, the law of desorption of methane in coal seams is more
   complicated in the process of mining deep coal seams, which is prone to
   methane over-limit, coal and gas outburst, and other accidents. In order
   to study the desorption characteristics of coalbed methane under
   different loading and temperature conditions, the desorption tests at
   different deformation stages of coal containing methane were carried out
   in the process of loading-adsorption-desorption-reloading until the coal
   sample was destroyed by using the seepage-adsorption-desorption test
   system on coal and rock mass, and the test programs were different
   combinations of gas pressure 1.2 MPa, two kinds of confining pressure,
   and three kinds of temperature. The results show that the cumulative
   methane desorption amount corresponding to each deformation stage
   presents a convex parabolic increase trend with the increase in
   desorption time, while the desorption rate presents a power function
   decay trend. Under the condition of the same desorption time, the
   cumulative methane desorption amount from large to small is residual
   deformation stage, compaction stage, near the peak stress, plastic
   deformation stage, and elastic deformation stage. Under the same
   confining pressure, temperature, and methane pressure, the maximum
   desorption rate from large to small is residual deformation stage, near
   the peak stress, plastic deformation stage, compaction stage, and
   elastic deformation stage. The desorption and diffusion of methane are
   promoted under the higher temperature and lower confining pressure,
   which presents a certain mechanism of promoting desorption. The thermal
   movement of methane molecules is intensified with the increase in
   temperature, and the adsorption effect between methane molecules and the
   molecules at the surface of the coal is weakened. The cumulative methane
   desorption amount and the maximum desorption rate increase with the
   increase in temperature. The cumulative methane desorption in the
   residual deformation stage is obviously greater than that in other
   deformation stages. The increase in confining pressure inhibits the
   development and expansion of pore fractures in raw coal specimen and
   hinders the increase in the effective desorption surface area. The
   cumulative methane desorption amount and the maximum desorption rate
   decrease with the increase in confining pressure.}},

Title = {{Genome-Wide Prediction of Complex Traits in Two Outcrossing Plant
   Species Through Deep Learning and Bayesian Regularized Neural Network}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 27}},
Abstract = {{Genomic selection models were investigated to predict several complex
   traits in breeding populations of Zea mays L. and Eucalyptus globulus
   Labill. For this, the following methods of Machine Learning (ML) were
   implemented: (i) Deep Learning (DL) and (ii) Bayesian Regularized Neural
   Network (BRNN) both in combination with different hyperparameters. These
   ML methods were also compared with Genomic Best Linear Unbiased
   Prediction (GBLUP) and different Bayesian regression models {[}Bayes A,
   Bayes B, Bayes C pi, Bayesian Ridge Regression, Bayesian LASSO, and
   Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS)]. DL models, using Rectified
   Linear Units (as the activation function), had higher predictive ability
   values, which varied from 0.27 (pilodyn penetration of 6 years old
   eucalypt trees) to 0.78 (flowering-related traits of maize). Moreover,
   the larger mini-batch size (100\%) had a significantly higher predictive
   ability for wood-related traits than the smaller mini-batch size (10\%).
   On the other hand, in the BRNN method, the architectures of one and two
   layers that used only the pureline function showed better results of
   prediction, with values ranging from 0.21 (pilodyn penetration) to 0.71
   (flowering traits). A significant increase in the prediction ability was
   observed for DL in comparison with other methods of genomic prediction
   (Bayesian alphabet models, GBLUP, RKHS, and BRNN). Another important
   finding was the usefulness of DL models (through an iterative algorithm)
   as an SNP detection strategy for genome-wide association studies. The
   results of this study confirm the importance of DL for genome-wide
   analyses and crop/tree improvement strategies, which holds promise for
   accelerating breeding progress.}},

Abstract = {{Nanofiber-based ion-exchange membranes display distinctive features in
   energy applications. Bead formation and diameter of nanofibers determine
   the characteristics of these structures, which can be controlled by the
   electrospinning process. However, the electrospinning of
   polyelectrolytes is challenging due to the existence of ionic groups in
   the polymer structure. To this end, firstly, synthesis and
   characterization of hydroquinone-based sulfonated polysulfone with a
   40\% degree of sulfonation as a characteristic model are performed. To
   investigate the effect of electrospinning parameters on the morphology
   and diameter of the nanofiber, the appropriate numbers of experiments
   are designed using the Taguchi method; polymer solution concentration,
   voltage, feed rate, and needle to collector distance are considered as
   the design parameters. The proposed levels by the designed experiment
   are examined by scanning electron microscopy images. In the next step,
   the response surface method and the analysis of variance are employed to
   study the effect of each variable and the effectiveness of the final
   model. Finally, the parameters are optimized by the Genetic algorithm to
   gain the possible minimum diameter.
   Accordingly, the polymer solution concentration is the most effective
   parameter. Moreover, the electrospun thin bead-free nanofibers with an
   average diameter of about 97.5 nm are attained. The conductivity
   measurement (in water and temperature range of 20-100 degrees C) of the
   nanofibrous mat shows superior values of 0.1105-0.2851 S/cm compared to
   the dense membrane with a conductivity of 0.0791-0.2201 S/cm. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{The pseudokinase TRIB1 controls cell function in a range of contexts, by
   regulating MAP kinase activation and mediating protein degradation via
   the COP1 ubiquitin ligase. TRIB1 regulates polarization of macrophages
   and dysregulated Trib1 expression in murine models has been shown to
   alter atherosclerosis burden and adipose homeostasis. Recently, TRIB1
   has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer, where
   it is often overexpressed, even in the absence of genetic amplification.
   Well described TRIB1 effectors include MAP kinases and C/EBP
   transcription factors, both in immune cells and in carcinogenesis.
   However, the mechanisms that regulate TRIB1 itself remain elusive. Here,
   we show that the long and conserved 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) of
   TRIB1 is targeted by miRNAs in macrophage and prostate cancer models. By
   using a systematic in silico analysis, we identified multiple ``high
   confidence{''} miRNAs potentially binding to the 3'UTR of TRIB1 and
   report that miR-101-3p and miR-132-3p are direct regulators of TRIB1
   expression and function. Binding of miR-101-3p and miR-132-3p to the
   3'UTR of TRIB1 mRNA leads to an increased transcription and secretion of
   interleukin-8. Our data demonstrate that modulation of TRIB1 by miRNAs
   alters the inflammatory profile of both human macrophages and prostate
   cancer cells.}},

Abstract = {{The endosymbiotic acquisition of mitochondria and plastids more than one
   billion years ago was central for the evolution of eukaryotic life.
   However, owing to their ancient origin, these organelles provide only
   limited insights into the initial stages of organellogenesis. The
   cercozoan amoeba Paulinella chromatophora contains photosynthetic
   organelles-termed chromatophores-that evolved from a cyanobacterium
   similar to 100 million years ago, independently from plastids in plants
   and algae. Despite the more recent origin of the chromatophore, it shows
   tight integration into the host cell. It imports hundreds of
   nucleus-encoded proteins, and diverse metabolites are continuously
   exchanged across the two chromatophore envelope membranes. However, the
   limited set of chromatophore-encoded solute transporters appears
   insufficient for supporting metabolic connectivity or protein import.
   Furthermore, chromatophore-localized biosynthetic pathways as well as
   multiprotein complexes include proteins of dual genetic origin,
   suggesting that mechanisms evolved that coordinate gene expression
   levels between chromatophore and nucleus. These findings imply that
   similar to the situation in mitochondria and plastids, also in P.
   chromatophora nuclear factors evolved that control metabolite exchange
   and gene expression in the chromatophore. Here we show by mass
   spectrometric analyses of enriched insoluble protein fractions that,
   unexpectedly, nucleus-encoded transporters are not inserted into the
   chromatophore inner envelope membrane. Thus, despite the apparent
   maintenance of its barrier function, canonical metabolite transporters
   are missing in this membrane. Instead we identified several expanded
   groups of short chromatophore-targeted orphan proteins. Members of one
   of these groups are characterized by a single transmembrane helix, and
   others contain amphipathic helices. We hypothesize that these proteins
   are involved in modulating membrane permeability. Thus, the mechanism
   generating metabolic connectivity of the chromatophore fundamentally
   differs from the one for mitochondria and plastids, but likely rather
   resembles the poorly understood mechanism in various bacterial
   endosymbionts in plants and insects. Furthermore, our mass spectrometric
   analysis revealed an expanded family of chromatophore-targeted helical
   repeat proteins. These proteins show similar domain architectures as
   known organelle-targeted expression regulators of the octotrico peptide
   repeat type in algae and plants. Apparently these chromatophore-targeted
   proteins evolved convergently to plastid-targeted expression regulators
   and are likely involved in gene expression control in the chromatophore.}},

Abstract = {{Fox Glacier/Te Moeka o Tuawe is a fast-responding maritime glacier that

   Here we use a combination of repeat photography, Structure from Motion
   (SfM), and ice discharge measurement, to identify key morphological
   differences associated with these repeated phase changes, and assess how
   much of the current terminus is still dynamically active. Increasing
   surface-debris cover at the margins and topographic shading result in
   the asymmetry of the retreating terminus, with central portions receding
   faster than the margins. In 2019, the glacier is shorter than at any
   time in recorded history, and ice flux is insufficient to sustain the
   current glacier length, with a further similar to 300 m of the glacier
   terminus region potentially vulnerable to retreat. However, due to the
   high climate sensitivity of this maritime glacier, even a slight shift
   towards increasing mass flux could see this trend reverse.}},

   ruptures is related to therapeutic success. Therefore, it is of

   semi-structured interviews pre- and post-AFT, they were asked about
   their expectations from and experiences with the training. The
   transcriptions of the interviews were analyzed using the Consensual
   Qualitative Research (CQR) method. Before the AFT, participants showed
   ambivalent attitudes and fears mainly towards self-revelation. After the
   training, they mainly described personal development and progress in
   learning to deal with alliance ruptures. Video recordings of therapy
   sessions, role plays and training of metacommunikation skills were

Title = {{Predictors of local recurrence and its impact on survival after

Abstract = {{Objectives To identify predictive pathological factors for local
   recurrence (LR) and to study the impact of LR on survival in patients
   treated with glansectomy for penile squamous cell carcinoma (pSCC).
   Patients and Methods We retrospectively studied patients treated with
   glansectomy at international, high-volume reference centres. We analysed
   histopathological predictors of LR, stratified patients into risk groups
   based on the number of risk factors present, and studied the impact of
   LR on survival outcomes using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and
   stepwise Cox proportional hazards regression models. Subsequently, we
   performed sensitivity analyses excluding margin-positive cases, pT3
   disease, and cN+ disease, or all of these factors.
   Results Across nine institutions, 897 patients were included, of whom 94
   experienced LR. On multivariable analysis, presence of high-grade
   disease and pT3 stage were independent predictors of LR. LR-free
   survival rates significantly differed according to the number of risk
   factors present, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.90 (95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI] 1.17-3.07; P = 0.01) for the intermediate-risk group
   (one risk factor) and 6.11 (95\% CI 3.47-10.77; P < 0.001) for the
   high-risk group (two risk factors), using the low-risk group (no risk
   factors) as reference. Patients who experienced LR had significantly
   worse overall survival (OS; HR 2.89, 95\% CI 2.02-4.14; P < 0.001) and
   cancer-specific survival (CSS; HR 5.64, 95\% CI 3.45-9.22; P < 0.001).
   LR (HR 3.82, 95\% CI 2.14-6.8; P < 0.001), lymphovascular invasion and
   cN status were significant predictors of decreased CSS. LR remained a
   strong predictor of both OS and CSS in all sensitivity analyses.
   Conclusions Pathological T3 stage and presence of high-grade disease
   were independent histopathological predictors of LR after glansectomy
   for primary pSCC, which allowed risk stratification into three groups
   with significantly different risk of developing LR. Additionally, LR is
   related to poor OS and CSS, indicating that LR is a manifestation of
   underlying aggressive disease and clearly challenging the dogma of using
   organ-sparing surgery whenever possible since survival is unaffected by
   higher LR rates.}},

Abstract = {{We present a case of a 39-year-old man who was brought in by ambulance
   to the ED after ingesting 103 packets of cocaine prior to return to the
   United Kingdom (UK) from Holland. He presented with a persistent sinus
   tachycardia and mild abdominal pain but no evidence of peritonitis on
   examination. Contrast-enhanced CT showed widespread distribution of
   packets from the stomach to the sigmoid colon. He was taken to theater
   for emergency laparotomy and retrieval of the packets, which was done
   successfully without the need of any bowel resection. He was then
   discharged to police custody following a 10-day admission. This is the
   highest number of cocaine packets reported in the UK literature. This
   case report discusses the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in
   safely managing body packers who also present with signs of cocaine
   toxicity.}},

Title = {{Semantic Relativism and Logical Implication}},
Journal = {{ERKENNTNIS}},
Abstract = {{Semantic relativism is the view that the truth-value of some types of
   statements can vary depending on factors besides possible worlds and
   times, without any change in their propositional content. It has grown
   increasingly popular as a semantic theory of several types of
   statements, including statements that attribute knowledge of a
   proposition to a subject (knowledge attributions). The ways of knowing
   claim is the view that perception logically implies knowledge. In my
   ``Semantic Relativism and Ways of Knowing{''} (2019) I argued that a
   relativist semantics for knowledge attributions is incompatible with the
   ways of knowing claim. I suggested that this incompatibility depends on
   some basic features of the logic of relativist semantics, and therefore
   can be shown to generalise beyond the discussion of knowledge
   attributions to semantic relativism more broadly. Here I make this
   generalisation. I demonstrate that for any proposition p expressed by a
   statement that does not have a relativist semantics, and for any
   proposition q expressed by a statement that does have a relativist
   semantics, p fails to logically imply q. I explain why this happens,
   discuss some of its philosophical consequences, and consider a way to
   modify relativist semantics to avoid it. I conclude that semantic
   relativism raises interesting philosophical questions that have gone
   largely unnoticed in discussions of this view until now.}},

Title = {{Propofol Requirement and EEG Alpha Band Power During General Anesthesia
   Provide Complementary Views on Preoperative Cognitive Decline}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{NOV 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Although cognitive decline (CD) is associated with increased
   post-operative morbidity and mortality, routinely screening patients
   remains difficult. The main objective of this prospective study is to
   use the EEG response to a Propofol-based general anesthesia (GA) to
   reveal CD.
   Methods: 42 patients with collected EEG and Propofol target
   concentration infusion (TCI) during GA had a preoperative cognitive
   assessment using MoCA. We evaluated the performance of three variables
   to detect CD (MoCA < 25 points): age, Propofol requirement to induce
   unconsciousness (TCI at SEF95: 8-13 Hz) and the frontal alpha band power
   (AP at SEF95: 8-13 Hz).
   Results: The 17 patients (40\%) with CD were significantly older (p <
   0.001), had lower TCI (p < 0.001), and AP (p < 0.001). We found using
   logistic models that TCI and AP were the best set of variables
   associated with CD (AUC: 0.89) and performed better than age (p < 0.05).
   Propofol TCI had a greater impact on CD probability compared to AP,
   although both were complementary in detecting CD.
   Conclusion: TCI and AP contribute additively to reveal patient with
   preoperative cognitive decline. Further research on post-operative
   cognitive trajectory are necessary to confirm the interest of intra
   operative variables in addition or as a substitute to cognitive
   evaluation.}},

Title = {{Amplitude and velocity dependence of patellar pendulum triggered by T

Journal = {{NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{3257-3266}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objectives The relation between increase of tonus and joint movement
   velocity is controversial in Parkinson's rigidity. It is accepted that
   the increase of tonus in rigidity is constant during joint movement, and
   does not change within all limits of movement. However, there is
   thoughtful evidence that the change in tonus in rigidity has a
   correlation with joint movement velocity and amplitude of movement. The
   pendulum movement that is formed by triggering of the patellar T reflex
   allows the examination of phasic stretching reflexes and physiological
   changes of passive stretching. Therefore, the velocity and amplitude
   properties of tonus in Parkinson's rigidity can be scanned together.
   Materials and methods Patellar T reflex-triggered patellar pendulum was
   recorded in 40 Parkinson's patients. The velocity and amplitude changes
   in the pendulum were observed according to the rigidity scale. Muscle
   action potentials were recorded from the rectus femoris muscle and
   biceps femoris muscles simultaneously via superficial recording
   electrodes. Knee joint angle changes were recorded with a goniometer.
   The kinesiological and electromyographic features were compared with
   those of the control subjects. Results The number of pendulums decreased
   significantly, the angle of joint movement decreased, the peak time
   decreased and the angular velocity slowed down significantly in the
   Parkinson's group. While the latency of the patellar T reflex did not
   change significantly, its amplitude decreased, and the onset time of
   joint movement measured by accelerometer was prolonged. Conclusions
   Parkinson's rigidity has a velocity-dependent component, and this
   correlates negatively with the rigidity scale.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCED MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Due to strong interlayer interaction and ease of oxidation issues of
   black phosphorus (BP), the domain size of artificial synthesized
   few-layer black phosphorus (FL-BP) crystals is often below 10 mu m,
   which extremely limits its further applications in large-area thin-film
   devices and integrated circuits. Herein, a hydrogen-free electrochemical
   delamination strategy through weak Lewis acid intercalation enabled
   exfoliation is developed to produce ultralarge FL-BP single-crystalline
   domains with high quality. The interaction between the weak Lewis acid
   tetra-n-butylammonium acetate (CH(3)COOTBA) and P atoms promotes the
   average domain size of FL-BP crystal up to 77.6 +/- 15.0 mu m and the
   largest domain size is found to be as large as 119 mu m. The presence of
   H+ and H2O is found to sharply decrease the size of as-exfoliated FL-BP
   flakes. The electronic transport measurements show that the delaminated
   FL-BP crystals exhibit a high hole mobility of 76 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) and an
   on/off ratio of 10(3) at 298 K. A broadband photoresponse from 532 to
   1850 nm with ultrahigh responsivity is achieved. This work provides a
   scalable, simple, and low-cost approach for large-area BP films that
   meet industrial requirements for nanodevices applications.}},

Abstract = {{Sorafenib, the first-line agent for treatment of advanced hepatocellular
   carcinoma (HCC), improves median overall survival by approximately 3
   months. In the present study, we investigated whether sorafenib combined
   with cucurbitacin B (CuB), a natural tetracyclic triterpenoid isolated
   from Cucurbitaceae, exerts enhanced antitumor effects against HCC. Cell
   viability and colony formation ability were detected by cell-counting
   kit-8 and colony formation assays. Cell cycle and apoptosis were
   analyzed by flow cytometry. Protein expression was detected by western
   blotting. HepG2 xenografts in nude mice were used to evaluate in vivo
   antitumor effects. We report that sorafenib and CuB exhibited
   synergistic effects on cellular proliferation inhibition and cell
   apoptosis induction, but not on cell cycle arrest. Furthermore,
   combination treatment enhanced levels of cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved
   caspase 9, but suppressed phosphorylation of STAT3. Epidermal growth
   factor, a potent stimulator of signal transducer and activator of
   transcription-3 (STAT3), promoted cell viability and colony formation
   ability, whereas combination treatment exerted inhibitory effects on
   epidermal growth factor-induced STAT3 phosphorylation. Finally, HepG2
   xenograft mice cotreated with sorafenib and CuB exhibited reduced tumor
   progression without notable weight loss. In conclusion, sorafenib and
   CuB exert synergistic antitumor effects through a pathway that may
   involve STAT3 phosphorylation, and this may represent a promising

Abstract = {{N-ethylcarbazole (NEC) is a promising liquid organic hydrogen carrier,
   while sluggish kinetics of hydrogen absorption and desorption restrict
   its application. To overcome that, a YH3 promoted palladium catalyst
   Pd/Al2O3-YH3 is developed in this work by taking advantage of the fast
   reversible hydrogenation and dehydrogenation kinetics of YH3. With the
   Pd/Al2O3-YH3, NEC can reversibly store 5.5 wt\% hydrogen in 4 h below
   473 K. The performance is the best compared to that of all the reported
   catalysts for both hydrogen absorption and desorption. Moreover, there
   are no gaseous impurities produced and no performance decay during three
   hydrogen storage cycles. The excellent performance derives from the
   intrinsic high catalytic activity of Pd/Al2O3 and the promoting effect
   of YH3 by providing a new hydrogen transfer path, making NEC more
   attractive for practical application. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy

Title = {{Thermoelectric performance enhancement by manipulation of Sr/Ti doping
   in two sublayers of Ca3Co4O9}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ADVANCED CERAMICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Thermoelectric (TE) performance of Ca3Co4O9 (CCO) has been investigated
   extensively via a doping strategy in the past decades. However, the
   doping sites of different sublayers in CCO and their contributions to
   the TE performance remain unrevealed because of its strong correlated
   electronic system. In this work, Sr and Ti are chosen to realize doping
   at the {[}Ca2CoO3] and {[}CoO2] sublayers in CCO. It was found that
   figure of merit (ZT) at 957 K of Ti-doped CCO was improved 30\% than
   that of undoped CCO whereas 1 at\% Sr doping brought about a 150\%
   increase in ZT as compared to undoped CCO. The significant increase in
   electronic conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient are attributed to
   the enhanced carrier concentration and spin-entropy of Co4+ originating
   from the Sr doping effects in {[}Ca2CoO3] sublayer, which are evidenced
   by the scanning electron microscope (SEM), Raman, Hall, and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. Furthermore, the reduced
   thermal conductivity is attributed to the improved phonon scattering
   from heavier Sr doped Ca site in {[}Ca2CoO3] sublayer. Our findings
   demonstrate that doping at Ca sites of {[}Ca2CoO3] layer is a feasible
   pathway to boost TE performance of CCO material through promoting the
   electronic conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient, and reducing the
   thermal conductivity simultaneously. This work provides a deep
   understanding of the current limited ZT enhancement on CCO material and
   provides an approach to enhance the TE performance of other layered
   structure materials.}},

Title = {{Quantifying the Effects of Vegetation Restorations on the Soil Erosion
   Export and Nutrient Loss on the Loess Plateau}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 27}},
Abstract = {{The transport of eroded soil to rivers changes the nutrient cycles of
   river ecosystems and has significant impacts on the regional
   eco-environment and human health. The Loess Plateau, a leading
   vegetation restoration region in China and the world, has experienced
   severe soil erosion and nutrient loss, however, the extent to which
   vegetation restoration prevents soil erosion export (to rivers) and it
   caused nutrient loss is unknown. To evaluate the effects of the first
   stage of the Grain for Green Project (GFGP) on the Loess Plateau
   (started in 1999 and ended in 2013), we analyzed the vegetation change
   trends and quantified the effects of GFGP on soil erosion export (to
   rivers) and it caused nutrient loss by considering soil erosion
   processes. The results were as follows: (1) in the first half of study
   period (from 1982 to 1998), the vegetation cover changed little, but
   after the implementation of the first stage of the GFGP (from 1999 to
   2013), the vegetation cover of 75.0\% of the study area showed a
   significant increase; (2) The proportion of eroded areas decreased from
   41.8 to 26.7\% as a result of the GFGP, and the erosion intensity
   lessened in most regions; the implementation significantly reduce the
   soil nutrient loss; (3) at the county level, soil erosion export could
   be avoided significantly by the increasing of vegetation greenness in
   the study area (R = -0.49). These results illustrate the relationships
   among changes in vegetation cover, soil erosion and nutrient export,
   which could provide a reference for local government for making
   ecology-relative policies.}},

Title = {{Preschool Teachers' Emotional Exhaustion in Relation to Classroom
   Instruction and Teacher-child Interactions}},
Journal = {{EARLY EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT}},
Abstract = {{The present investigation examined the links between preschool teachers'
   self-reported emotional exhaustion (n = 117) with the quality of their
   classroom interactions and the dosage and rigor of their instruction.
   Research Findings: Although teachers' experience of emotional exhaustion
   was not associated with the dosage and rigor of instruction, more
   emotionally exhausted teachers demonstrated lower quality interactions
   with children in their classroom. Additionally, there was some evidence
   to suggest that the association between emotional exhaustion and
   preschool teachers' classroom interactions was dependent on their years
   of education, such that the relation between teachers' education and
   their interactions with children was reduced when they described
   themselves as more emotionally exhausted. Practice or Policy: Taken
   together, these results suggest that supporting preschool teachers'
   well-being, and in particular helping minimize emotional exhaustion,
   maybe a beneficial strategy to foster a higher quality classroom
   environment.}},

Title = {{Behavioral Immune System Responses to Coronavirus: A Reinforcement
   Sensitivity Theory Explanation of Conformity, Warmth Toward Others and
   Attitudes Toward Lockdown}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{Behavioral immune system (BIS) describes psychological mechanisms that
   detect cues to infectious pathogens in the immediate environment,
   trigger disease-relevant responses and facilitate behavioral
   avoidance/escape. BIS activation elicits a perceived vulnerability to
   disease (PVD) which can result in conformity with social norms. However,
   a response to superficial cues can result in aversive responses to
   people that pose no actual threat, leading to an aversion to unfamiliar
   others, and likelihood of prejudice. Pathogen-neutralizing behaviors,
   therefore, have implications for social interaction as well as illness
   behaviors and responses to health communications. In this study, we
   investigate how PVD influences conformity, attitudes to other people and
   to lockdown regulations through the lens of the Reinforcement
   Sensitivity Theory (RST). RST describes personality in terms of
   biologically-driven approach and avoidance motivations which support
   personal goals. Participants from the United Kingdom public (N = 605)
   completed an RST personality questionnaire and then read either (a)
   coronavirus morbidity-mortality statistics and current United Kingdom
   government lifestyle regulations, (b) just the regulations (as presented
   in most government publicity materials), or (c) no information at all.
   They all completed the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease scale to
   assess BIS-relevant Germ Aversion and Perceived Infectability, followed
   by questions measuring social conformity, warmth toward others and
   attitudes toward lockdown measures. Significantly lower PVD scores were
   observed in the no-information condition, with the other conditions
   showing no difference. In terms of RST, approach behaviors related to
   goal-drive persistence work alongside fear in explaining conformity to
   social norms. Reward related approach behaviors partially explained
   warmth toward others, indicating that social rewards gained through
   interaction continue to be strong drivers of behavior. We found no role
   for RST traits in attitudes toward lockdown. Overall,
   coronavirus-related behavior is not driven purely by fear, but also by
   social and/or protection goals regulated by approach motivation. This
   study presents new insights into public perceptions of coronavirus and
   government regulated lifestyle restrictions, helping to explain social
   behaviors in terms of biologically driven mechanisms. Such understanding
   is vital if we are to successfully motivate public behavior to constrain
   spread of the virus.}},

   and clinal variation. In this investigation we aimed to describe
   morphological and genetic diversity of S. balcanica in Bosnia and
   Herzegovina, investigate phylogenetic relationships among populations
   and get insight into their evolutionary history. The obtained results
   revealed pronounced genetic structuring inside S. balcanica in Bosnia
   and Herzegovina and moderate to high genetic diversity contained inside
   each population. Lineages and sublineages of S. balcanica in Bosnia and
   Herzegovina diverged during Pleistocene epoch and their evolution was
   most likely shaped by alteration of glaciations with interglacial
   periods. Based on morphometric characters, investigated populations fall
   within already reported range for S. balcanica. However, distinctiveness
   of populations from Brka, Suturlija and Turija Rivers from the remaining
   populations in their body shapes have been observed and discussed in
   relation to separate evolutionary history of some populations.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose {[}Ga-68]Ga-labeled fibroblast activation protein inhibitors
   ({[}Ga-68]Ga-FAPi) have shown promising preclinical and clinical results
   in PET imaging. The present study aimed to evaluate the biodistribution,
   pharmacokinetics, and dosimetry of {[}Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi, another
   modified FAPi tracer, and performed a head-to-head comparison with
   {[}F-18]F-FDG PET/CT scans in patients with various cancers.
   Methods In this prospective study, patients underwent both {[}F-18]F-FDG
   and {[}Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi PET/CT scans 60 min post-injection (p.i.).
   Dosimetry studies were conducted in three patients using
   {[}Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi serial time-point imaging. The absorbed dose
   was calculated using OLINDA/EXM 2.2 software. Quantification of the
   uptake of the tracers was assessed using standardized uptake values
   corrected for lean body mass (SUL).
   Results Fifty-four patients (mean age; 48.4 years) with 14 types of
   cancers involving 37\% breast, 24\% lung, 7.4\% head and neck (H\&N),
   and remaining 31.6\% patients with other histologies were evaluated
   prospectively. Physiological uptake of {[}Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi was
   observed in the liver, kidneys, pancreas, heart contents, and to a
   lesser extent in the lacrimals, oral mucosa, salivary glands, and
   thyroid glands. Uptake in the target lesions on {[}Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi
   scan was initiated at 10 min, and no additional lesions were detected in
   the delayed acquisition time points. The pancreas was the organ with the
   highest absorbed dose (5.46E-02 mSv/MBq). While the patient-based
   comparison between the radiotracers revealed complete concordance in the
   detection of primary, pleural thickening, bone and liver metastases, and
   second primary malignancy, discordant findings were observed in the
   detection of lymph node (7.5\%), lung nodules (5.6\%), and brain
   metastases (2\%). According to the site of primary disease, patients
   with H\&N cancers demonstrated the highest SULpeak and average (avg)
   values on {[}Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA-FAPi which was similar to the values of
   {[}F-18]F-FDG {[}(SULpeak: 15.4 vs. 14.2; P-0.680) (SULavg: 8.3 vs. 7.9;
   P-0.783)]. The lowest uptake was observed in lung cancers with both the
   radiotracers {[}(SULpeak: 5.8 vs. 7.4; P-0.238) (SULavg: 4.9 vs. 5.3;
   P-0.313)]. A significantly higher SULpeak and SULavg for brain
   metastases to normal brain parenchyma ratios were observed on
   {[}Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi in contrast to the {[}F-18]F-FDG values
   \{SULpeak: median: 59.3 (IQR: 33.5-130.8) versus 1.5 (1-2.3); P-0.028\}.
   Except for brain metastases, comparable SULpeak and average values were
   noted between the radiotracers in all other regions of metastases with
   no significant difference.
   Conclusion {[}Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi is a promising alternative among the
   FAPI class of molecules and performed well as compared to
   standard-of-care radiotracer {[}F-18]F-FDG in the diagnosis of various
   cancers.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The COVID-19 outbreak has forced a 2-month lockdown (LD) in
   Spain. We aimed to assess how that had affected our cohort of bariatric
   patients waiting for surgery. Methods A review of electronic records and
   a structured phone interview with each patient were conducted. Changes
   in severity of obesity were analyzed using the Obesity Surgery Score
   (OSS) and changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using the
   validated EQ-5D questionnaire. Other miscellaneous questions about
   behavior modifications and surgical risk perception were also analyzed.
   Results All 51 patients fully answered the questionnaires. Mean age was
   47 years and mean time on waiting list 91 days. Mean BMI increased
   during LD (42.7 vs 43.2; p < 0.001). Both OSS (2.84 vs 3; p = 0.011) and
   EQ-5D (69 vs 64; p < 0.001) mildly worsened during LD, mainly due to
   psychosocial issues. Twenty-seven patients (53\%) thought that
   perioperative risks were higher under the current circumstances but they
   were as willing to undergo surgery as those who believed that the risks
   had not increased (74\% vs 87\%, p = 0.2). Conclusions COVID-19 LD had a
   significant but mild effect on our cohort of bariatric surgery waiting
   list patients. Although perioperative risk perception had increased,
   patients were still willing to undergo their planned surgeries.}},

Abstract = {{Viral infection with SARS-CoV-2 has a neurological tropism that may
   induce an encephalopathy. In this context, electroencephalographic
   exploration (EEG) is indicated as a diagnostic argument correlated with
   lumbar puncture, biology, and imaging. We performed a retrospective
   analysis of 42 patients explored by EEG and infected by COVID-19,
   according to the EEG abnormalities and clinical signs that motivated the
   examination. Confusion and epileptic seizures were the most common
   clinical indications, with 64\% of the patients displaying these
   symptoms. The EEG was altered in 85\% of the cases of confusion, in 57\%
   of the cases of epileptic symptoms (general or focal seizure or
   prolonged loss of contact) and 20\% of the cases of malaise or brief
   loss of consciousness. Nine EEG (21\%) were in favor of an
   encephalopathy, two had de novo alterations in persistent consciousness
   and two had alterations in general states of confusion; one was very
   agitated and without history of epilepsy and combined eyelids clonia
   while a second one exhibited unconsciousness with left hemicorpus
   clonus. Two were being investigated for delayed awakening without
   sedation for more than 24 h. All of these patients were diagnosed
   COVID-19, some of them with associated mild to severe respiratory
   disorders. This work shows the interest of the EEG in exploring COVID-19
   patients suffering from neurological or general symptoms looking for
   cerebral alteration.}},

Abstract = {{The peach fruit moth (PFM), Carposina sasakii Matsumura, is a major
   phytophagous orchard pest widely distributed across Northeast Asia.
   Here, we report the chromosome-level genome for the PFM, representing
   the first genome for the family Carposinidae, from the lepidopteran
   superfamily Copromorphoidea. The genome was assembled into 404.83 Mb
   sequences using PacBio long-read and Illumina short-read sequences,
   including 275 contigs, with a contig N50 length of 2.62 Mb. All contigs
   were assembled into 31 linkage groups assisted by the Hi-C technique,
   including 30 autosomes and a Z chromosome. BUSCO analysis showed that
   98.3\% of genes were complete and 0.4\% of genes were fragmented, while
   1.3\% of genes were missing in the assembled genome. In total, 21,697
   protein-coding genes were predicted, of which 84.80\% were functionally
   annotated. Because of the importance of diapause triggered by
   photoperiod in PFM, five circadian genes in the PFM as well as in the
   other related species were annotated, and potential genes related to
   diapause and photoperiodic reaction were also identified from
   transcriptome sequencing. In addition, manual annotation of
   detoxification gene families was undertaken and showed a higher number
   of glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene in PFM than in most other
   lepidopterans, in contrast to a lower number of uridine diphosphate
   (UDP)-glycosyltransferase (UGT) gene, carboxyl/cholinesterases (CCE)
   gene and cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (P450) gene, suggesting different
   detoxication pathways in this moth. The high-quality genome provides a
   resource for comparative evolutionary studies of this moth and its
   relatives within the context of radiations across Lepidoptera.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a dynamically coupled 3D-2DV hydrodynamic model,
   which combines an unstructured Cartesian grid three-dimensional
   hydrodynamic model named UnLESS3D with a laterally averaged model for
   estuaries (LAMFE). Both UnLESS3D and LAMFE are shallow water models,
   which solve unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. The
   coupled hydrodynamic model, named UnLESS, is very suitable and efficient
   for rivers, lakes, and estuaries, which have not only large waterbodies
   but also long, meandering, and narrow tributaries. The dynamic coupling
   of UnLESS3D and LAMFE is facilitated with a semiimplicit scheme called
   the free-surface correction (FSC) method. The resulting coupled model
   UnLESS is unconditionally stable with respect to the gravity waves,
   bottom shear stress, and vertical eddy viscosity terms. The UnLESS model
   was tested with an idealized estuary case which has a large basin and
   two narrow tributaries, providing freshwater flow to the basin. Model
   results using UnLESS were compared with those using the UnLESS3D model.
   It was found that the UnLESS model can reproduce the model results of
   UnLESS3D. The UnLESS model was also applied to Charlotte Harbor, with
   its major tributaries flowing to its northern part being included in the
   simulation domain. A good agreement of model results of water level,
   current, salinity, and temperature simulated by the UnLESS model with
   real-time data measured in Charlotte Harbor and its tributaries suggest
   that the method presented here is robust in dynamically coupling the 3D
   unstructured Cartesian Grid model UnLESS3D with the laterally averaged
   model LAMFE.}},

   7 days, 5041 mg center dot kg(-1) of chromium (Cr) could be accumulated
   in the whole plants of mung bean. Moreover, about 80\% of Cr in the mung
   bean plants are transformed to fractions with low bioavailability. This

   Lignin by Acid-Catalyzed Solvothermal Liquefaction in Methanol}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ENERGY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Extracted alkali lignin (AL) and organosolv lignin (OL) from sugarcane
   bagasse were acid-catalyzed liquefied in methanol with the aim of
   producing oligomeric aromatic oxides. Acids were screened for their
   effects on the output of oligomeric aromatic oxides from alkali lignin
   liquefaction. Based on the highest amount of lignin conversion, the
   order of catalytic efficiency was: p-toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH) >
   CCl3COOH (TCA) > KHSO4 > AlCl3 > H3O40PW12 > H2SO4. The most alkali
   lignin conversion was 86.2 wt\% when catalyzed by p-toluenesulfonic
   acid. Optimized liquefaction temperatures indicated that AL liquefaction
   optimum temperature was 250 degrees C and OL was 175 degrees C. GPC
   characterized AL, OL and resultant products implied that TsOH could
   degrade both lignins to about 780 g/mol of molecular weight. HSQC-NMR
   and GC-MS observations suggested that simultaneous vinyl ether cleavage
   and intermediate stabilization of phenolic hydroxyl group etherification
   at high temperatures achieved AL liquefaction. Acidolysis of beta-ether
   linkages at mild temperatures was the mechanism of OL liquefaction.}},

Abstract = {{A computable general equilibrium model linked to a microsimulation model
   is applied to assess the potential short-term effects on the South
   African economy of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. With a particular
   focus on distributional outcomes, two simulations are run, a mild and a
   severe scenario. The findings show significant evidence of decline in
   economic growth and employment, with the decline harsher for the severe
   scenario. The microeconomic results show that the pandemic moves the
   income distribution curve such that more households fall under the
   poverty line while at the same time, inequality declines. The latter
   result is driven by the disproportionate decline in incomes of richer
   households while the poorest of the poor are cushioned by government
   social grants that are kept intact during the pandemic. The COVID-19
   pandemic is still unfolding and its economic modelling as well as the
   data used to operationalise the model will need to be updated and

Abstract = {{Agroecological landscapes have the potential to simultaneously meet food
   security and biodiversity conservation goals but are hindered by

   parameters for their potential capacity to move a social-ecological
   system from states of conflict to alternative desired system states
   devoid of major losses for both food security and biodiversity, that is
   landscapes of coexistence. We discuss how reframing landscapes as
   social-ecological systems allows focusing on manageable components, or
   coexistence parameters, that explain biodiversity impacts and are hence
   capable of dampening conflicts. Approaches from the social, economic, or
   ecological sciences allow for the formulation of management strategies
   tailor-made for each system, with a higher chance of success than
   one-size-fits-all strategies. Conceptually recognizing coexistence

Abstract = {{Oncogenic protein Myc serves as a transcription factor to control cell
   metabolisms. Myc dimerizes via leucine zipper with its associated
   partner protein Max to form a heterodimer structure, which then binds
   target DNA sequences to regulate gene transcription. The regulation
   depends on Myc-Max binding to DNA and searching for target sequences via
   diffusional motions along DNA. Here, we conduct structure- based
   molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the diffusion
   dynamics of the Myc-Max heterodimer along DNA. We found that the
   heterodimer protein slides on the DNA in a rotation- uncoupled manner in
   coarse-grained simulations, as its two helical DNA binding basic regions
   (BRs) alternate between open and closed conformations via inchworm
   stepping motions. In such motions, the two BRs of the heterodimer step
   across the DNA strand one by one, with step sizes reaching about half of
   a DNA helical pitch length. Atomic MD simulations of the Myc-Max
   heterodimer in complex with DNA have also been conducted. Hydrogen bond
   interactions are revealed between the two BRs and two complementary DNA
   strands, respectively. In the non-specific DNA binding, the BR from Myc
   shows an onset of stepping on one association DNA strand and starts
   detaching from the other strand. Overall, our simulation studies suggest
   that the inchworm stepping motions of the Myc-Max heterodimer can be
   achieved during the protein diffusion along DNA. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Title = {{Discovery of 5,5 `-Methylenedi-2,3-Cresotic Acid as a Potent Inhibitor
   of the Chemotactic Activity of the HMGB1 center dot CXCL12 Heterocomplex
   Using Virtual Screening and NMR Validation}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{HMGB1 is a key molecule that both triggers and sustains inflammation
   following infection or injury, and is involved in a large number of
   pathologies, including cancer. HMGB1 participates in the recruitment of
   inflammatory cells, forming a heterocomplex with the chemokine CXCL12
   (HMGB1 center dot CXCL12), thereby activating the G-protein coupled
   receptor CXCR4. Thus, identification of molecules that disrupt this
   heterocomplex can offer novel pharmacological opportunities to treat
   inflammation-related diseases. To identify new HMGB1 center dot CXCL12
   inhibitors we have performed a study on the ligandability of the single
   HMG boxes of HMGB1 followed by a virtual screening campaign on both HMG
   boxes using Zbc Drugs and three different docking programs (Glide,
   AutoDock Vina, and AutoDock 4.2.6). The best poses in terms of scoring
   functions, visual inspection, and predicted ADME properties were further
   filtered according to a pharmacophore model based on known HMGB1 binders
   and clustered according to their structures. Eight compounds
   representative of the clusters were tested for HMGB1 binding by NMR. We
   identified 5,5 `-methylenedi-2,3-cresotic acid (2a) as a binder of both
   HMGB1 and CXCL12; 2a also targets the HMGB1 center dot CXCL12
   heterocomplex. In cell migration assays 2a inhibited the chemotactic
   activity of HMGB1 center dot CXCL12 with IC50 in the subnanomolar range,
   the best documented up to now. These results pave the way for future
   structure activity relationship studies to optimize the pharmacological
   targeting of HMGB1 center dot CXCL12 for anti-inflammatory purposes.}},

Title = {{72 Years of Homemaking in Waiting Zones: Lebanon's ``Permanently
   Temporary{''} Palestinian Refugee Camps}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN SOCIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{The ``permanently temporary{''} Palestinian refugee community, present
   in Lebanon since 1948 with no solution in sight, has the highest rate of
   abject poverty within all five areas of operation of United Nations
   Relief and Works Agency for Palestinians in the Near East (UNRWA), and
   it still occupies the same limited geographic space it did 72 years ago.
   This harsh reality stems from the refugees' statelessness but is also
   worsened by the local conditions imposed by the Lebanese legislation and
   (non)settlement policy aimed at preventing refugees from becoming
   permanent. Within this situation, we look at practices of agency enacted
   by camp dwellers to provide lacking life necessities and improve living
   conditions in the camps. This paper will identify and analyze coping
   mechanisms and homemaking practices undertaken by Palestinian refugees
   in Lebanon, operating within the framework set by Brun and Fabos (2015),
   which conceptualized home and homemaking for people in protracted
   displacement through identifying a refugee's ``home, Home and HOME.{''}
   Building on Donna Haraway's concept of situated knowledge, this paper
   uses data collected from participant observations, interviews,
   ethnographic and autoethnographic recordings analyzed through the lens
   of my own positioned rationality as a Palestinian refugee from Lebanon.
   Further, the paper will explore how Palestinian refugees establish camp
   spaces as a ``home-Home-HOME,{''} despite their uncertain futures,
   through vertical expansion of buildings, stories and family bonding, in
   addition to trading and micro-markets. The paper will also deduce how
   refugees' informal coping mechanisms offer a way of strengthening
   community bonds, making home in those, otherwise, uncomfortable
   ``waiting zones,{''} and finally, envisioning new ideas for
   restructuring the camp beyond the rule of formal institutions.}},

Title = {{Analysis of Restaurants' Operations Using Time-Driven Activity-based
   Costing (TDABC): Case Study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF QUALITY ASSURANCE IN HOSPITALITY \& TOURISM}},
Abstract = {{In today's competitive environment, the analysis of activities is not
   just about looking at the overall report of profit and loss but more in
   understanding which of the activities add value and which are identified
   as wastes. This study examines the implementation of Time-Driven
   Activity-based Costing (TDABC) to analyze the operations of restaurants
   and also explores its validity as an approach for mapping the value
   streams of the operational activities. For this purpose, a case study is
   planned to reprocess both direct and indirect costs of a restaurant
   using TDABC. Thus, an observation process is performed to gather the
   relevant data, besides investigating the case restaurant's cost
   accounting system. In this paper, two analytical techniques (TDABC \&
   VSM) are combined to identify both the true costs of the operational
   activities as well as distinguishing the non-value-added activities. The
   results have revealed that TDABC appears to be a very feasible approach
   for both setting the correct cost of operations in restaurants and
   mapping the source of value-added activities.}},

Title = {{SAS-SV Smartphone Addiction Scale in Mexican University Students}},
Journal = {{EDUCATION RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{Objective. The aim of this work was to validate the statistical
   significance and unidimensionality of the construct formed by the
   variables of the revised and short version of the Smartphone Addiction
   Scale (SAS-SV), adapted into Spanish, when applied to Mexican university
   students. Method. The questionnaires were administered to 244 students
   of Bachelor's Degree in Administration of the Universidad Autonoma de
   San Luis Potosi, Mexico; 174 women and 70 men, aged 17 to 30 years,
   between August and December 2018. A confirmatory factor analysis was
   performed, and the parameters of the variables were checked by maximum
   likelihood and also by Bayesian analysis. The reliability of the
   instrument was verified through Cronbach's alpha. As a final analysis,
   estimates of nonstandardized weights for the maximum likelihood method
   were compared against Bayesian a posteriori distribution estimates.
   Results. As a result, the model was found to adequately describe the
   sample data, presenting very small standard error estimates, and it was
   validated with Cronbach's alpha of 0.885. In both Bayesian and maximum
   likelihood analysis, it is consistently evident that the construct is
   unidimensional. However, for the sample studied, it was observed that 3
   of the variables did not reach a significant weight for the model.
   Conclusion. It concludes that the variables that measure smartphone
   addiction on the SAS-SV scale adapted to Spanish, indeed, form a
   unidimensional construct when applied to Mexican university students,
   which is consistent with results from previous studies. However, it is
   identified necessary to conduct further studies, in order to explain the
   low significance obtained for 3 variables of the model.}},

Title = {{Social Risk Early Warning of Environmental Damage of Large-Scale
   Construction Projects in China Based on Network Governance and LSTM
   Model}},
Journal = {{COMPLEXITY}},

Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{With the improvement of citizens' risk perception ability and
   environmental protection awareness, social conflicts caused by
   environmental problems in large-scale construction projects are becoming
   more and more frequent. Traditional social risk prevention management
   has some defects in obtaining risk data, such as limited coverage, poor
   availability, and insufficient timeliness, which makes it impossible to
   realize effective early warning of social risks in the era of big data.
   This paper focuses on the three environments of diversification of
   stakeholders, risk media, and big data era. The evolution
   characteristics of the social risk of environmental damage of
   large-scale construction projects are analyzed from the four stages of
   incubation, outbreak, mitigation, and regression in essence. On this
   basis, a social risk early warning model is constructed? and the
   multicenter network governance mode of social risk of environmental
   damage in large-scale construction projects and practical social risk
   prevention strategies in different stages are put forward. Experiments
   show that the long short-term memory neural network model is effective
   and feasible for predicting the social risk trend of environmental
   damage of large-scale construction projects. Compared with other
   classical models, the long short-term memory model has the advantages of
   strong processing capability and high early warning accuracy for
   time-sensitive data and will have broad application prospects in the
   field of risk control research. By using the network governance
   framework and long short-term memory model, this paper studies the
   environmental mass events of large-scale construction projects on the
   risk early warning method, providing reference for the government to
   effectively prevent and control social risk of environmental damage of
   large-scale construction project in China.}},

Abstract = {{Expansion of human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is a rapidly
   advancing field showing great promise for clinical applications. Recent
   evidence has implicated the nervous system and glial family ligands
   (GFLs) as potential drivers of hematopoietic survival and self renewal
   in the bone marrow niche; how to apply this process to HSC maintenance
   and expansion has yet to be explored. We show a role for the GFL
   receptor, RET, at the cell surface of HSCs in mediating sustained
   cellular growth, resistance to stress, and improved cell survival
   throughout in vitro expansion. HSCs treated with the key RET
   ligand/coreceptor complex, glial-derived neurotrophic factor and its
   coreceptor, exhibit improved progenitor function at primary
   transplantation and improved long-term HSC function at secondary
   transplantation. Finally, we show that RET drives a multifaceted
   intracellular signaling pathway, including key signaling intermediates
   protein kinase B, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, NF-kappa B,
   and p53, responsible for a wide range of cellular and genetic responses
   that improve cell growth and survival under culture conditions.}},

Title = {{iTRAQ-Based Phosphoproteomic Analysis of Toxoplasma gondii Tachyzoites
   Provides Insight Into the Role of Phosphorylation for its Invasion and
   Egress}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR AND INFECTION MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{The invasion and egress are two key steps in lytic cycle vital to the
   propagation of Toxoplasma gondii infection, and phosphorylation is
   believed to play important roles in these processes. However, the
   phosphoproteome of T. gondii at these two stages has not been
   characterized. In this study, we profiled the phosphoproteome of
   tachyzoites at the stages of ``just invading{''} (JI) and ``prior to
   egress{''} (PE) based on iTRAQ quantitative analysis, in which a total
   of 46 phosphopeptides, 42 phosphorylation sites, and 38 phosphoproteins
   were detected. In the comparison of PE vs. JI, 10 phosphoproteins were
   detected with their phosphorylation level significantly changed, and
   four of them were demonstrated to be significantly down-regulated at the
   transcriptional level. Bioinformatic analysis of these identified
   phosphoproteins suggested that phosphorylation-mediated modulation of
   protein function was employed to regulate the pathway of toxoplasmosis
   and metabolism and cellular processes correlated with tachyzoite's
   binding, location, and metabolism, and thus play vital roles in the
   parasite lytic cycle. Moreover, cytoskeletal network (CN)-associated
   Inner Membrane Complex (IMC1, IMC4, IMC6 and IMC12), Intravascular
   Network (IVN)-related GRAs (GRA2, GRA3, GRA7 and GRA12), and
   Parasitophorous Vacuole Membrane (PVM)-localized ROP5 were shown to be
   enriched at the central nodes in the protein interaction network
   generated by bioinformatic analysis, in which the phosphorylation level
   of IMC4, GRA2, GRA3, and GRA12 were found to be significantly regulated.
   This study revealed the main cellular processes and key phosphoproteins
   crucial for the invasion and egress of T. gondii, which will provide new
   insights into the developmental biology of T. gondii in vitro and
   contribute to the understanding of pathogen-host interaction from the
   parasite perspective.}},

Abstract = {{The voltage-gated sodium channels play a key role in the generation and
   propagation of the cardiac action potential. Emerging data indicate that
   the Na(v)1.8 channel, encoded by the SCN10A gene, is a modulator of
   cardiac conduction and variation in the gene has been associated with
   arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation (AF) and Brugada syndrome (BrS).
   The voltage gated sodium channels contain a calmodulin (CaM)-binding IQ
   domain involved in channel slow inactivation, we here investigated the
   role of CaM regulation of Na(v)1.8 channel function, and showed that CaM
   enhanced slow inactivation of the Na(v)1.8 channel and hyperpolarized
   steady-state inactivation curve of sodium currents. The effects of CaM
   on the channel gating were disrupted in the Na(v)1.8 channel truncated
   IQ domain. We studied Na(v)1.8 IQ domain mutations associated with AF
   and BrS, and found that a BrS-linked mutation (R1863Q) reduced the
   CaM-induced hyperpolarization shift, AF-linked mutations (R1869C and
   R1869G) disrupted CaM-induced enhanced inactivation, and effects of CaM
   on both development and recovery from slow inactivation were attenuated
   in all pathogenic mutations. Our findings indicate a role of CaM in the
   regulation of Na(v)1.8 channel function in cardiac arrhythmias.

   delays. By proposing some new techniques and employing mathematical
   induction method, the authors first derive a sufficient condition to
   analyse the stability of the system. The authors then investigate the
   l(infinity)-gain by exploiting the monotonicity of state trajectory.
   They show that the l(infinity)-gain for the considered systems is
   independent of the magnitude of delays and fully determined by the
   system matrices. The validity of the theoretical results is demonstrated
   by a numerical example.}},

Title = {{Gestational Age Dependency of Umbilical Cord Serum IL-6 Levels for
   Detecting Fetal Inflammation}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Objective The fetal inflammatory response syndrome (FIRS) is
   characterized by elevated concentrations of inflammatory cytokines in
   fetal blood, with preterm delivery and morbidity. Umbilical cord serum
   interleukin-6 (UC-s-IL-6) is an ideal marker for detecting FIRS.
   However, the effect of gestational age (GA) on UC-s-IL-6 levels has not
   been reported. This study aimed to determine the relationship between GA
   and UC-s-IL-6 levels, and GA-dependent cutoff values of UC-s-IL-6 levels
   for detecting fetal inflammation.
   Study Design UC-s-IL-6 concentrations were measured in 194 newborns (44
   extremely preterm newborns (EPNs) at 22-27 weeks' GA, 68 very preterm
   newborns (VPNs) at 28-31 weeks' GA, and 82 preterm newborns (PNs) at
   32-34 weeks' GA). Linear regression analyses were used to correlate GA
   and UC-s-IL-6 levels. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves
   analyses were performed for detecting the presence of funisitis, as the
   histopathological counterpart of FIRS.
   Results A significant negative correlation between GA and UC-s-IL-6
   levels was found in newborns with severe funisitis ( r (s) = - 0.427, p
   = 0.004) and those with mild funisitis ( r (s) = - 0.396, p = 0.025).
   ROC curve analyses revealed the area under the curve for detecting
   funisitis were 0.856, 0.837, and 0.622 in EPNs, VPNs, and PNs,
   respectively. The UC-s-IL-6 cutoff value in EPNs (28.1 pg/mL) exceeded
   those in VPNs and PNs (3.7 and 3.0 pg/mL, respectively).
   Conclusion UC-s-IL-6 levels were inversely correlated with GA especially
   in newborns with funisitis. Such GA dependency of UC-s-IL-6 should be
   considered for detecting fetal inflammation.}},

Title = {{UDP-Glycosyltransferases and Albendazole Metabolism in the Juvenile
   Stages of Haemonchus contortus}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{The nematode Haemonchus contortus, a gastrointestinal parasite of
   ruminants, can severely burden livestock production. Although
   anthelmintics are the mainstay in the treatment of haemonchosis, their
   efficacy diminishes due to drug-resistance development in H. contortus.
   An increased anthelmintics inactivation via biotransformation belongs to
   a significant drug-resistance mechanism in H. contortus.
   UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) participate in the metabolic
   inactivation of anthelmintics and other xenobiotic substrates through
   their conjugation with activated sugar, which drives the elimination of
   the xenobiotics due to enhanced solubility. The UGTs family, in terms of
   the biotransformation of commonly used anthelmintics, has been well
   described in adults as a target stage. In contrast, the free-living
   juvenile stages of H. contortus have attracted less attention. The
   expression of UGTs considerably varies throughout the life cycle of the
   juvenile nematodes, suggesting their different roles. Furthermore, the
   constitutive expression in a susceptible strain with two resistant
   strains shows several resistance-related changes in UGTs expression, and
   the exposure of juvenile stages of H. contortus to albendazole (ABZ) and
   ABZ-sulfoxide (ABZSO; in sublethal concentrations) leads to the
   increased expression of several UGTs. The anthelmintic drug ABZ and its
   primary metabolite ABZSO biotransformation, tested in the juvenile
   stages, shows significant differences between susceptible and resistant
   strain. Moreover, higher amounts of glycosidated metabolites of ABZ are
   formed in the resistant strain. Our results show similarly, as in
   adults, the UGTs and glycosidations significant for resistance-related
   differences in ABZ biotransformation and warrant further investigation
   in their individual functions.}},

   specific contexts. In the initial phase, the framework has used a set of
   existing indicators and tools to measure sustainability. Subsequently,
   the study has categorized the indicators to measure ESC sustainability
   based on the assessment of an expert opinion for which the Delphi
   technique has been employed. Grey relational analysis and RIDIT test
   have been instigated to validate the importance of the selected
   sustainability indicators and determine the relationships among the
   indicators. At the decisive stage, the VIF test is conducted followed by
   employing Random Forest Classifier, a supervised machine-learning
   algorithm to identify the redundant indicators. The variables that will
   be contributing positively towards the prediction performance of the
   model were included in the final list of indicators. This study prepared
   the base for designing a model for assessing the ESC sustainability of

Abstract = {{The myodural bridge (MDB) is a dense connective tissue structure that
   connects the subocciptal musculature to the spinal dura mater. The
   purpose of this study was to clarify morphological evolution
   characteristics and compositional changes in the fibrous structures of
   MDB during its growth and development in the atlanto-occipital
   interspace. For this, histological sections from Sprague-Dawley (SD)
   rats (age, E17 to adulthood) were stained with Masson's Trichrome and
   Picrosirius Red. The results demonstrated that at age E18, the posterior
   arch of the atlas was completely closed and MDB fibers had already begun
   to form. In rat embryos (E18-E21), only few fibers and muscles were
   present in the suboccipital region, and these were lightly stained. In
   postnatal rats, an obvious increase in the amount of fibers and muscle
   tissues was noted. At age P1, MDB fibers originated from the rectus
   capitis posterior minor muscle and merged into the atlanto-occipital
   membrane, which was closely attached to the spinal dura mater. As rats
   matured, MDB fibers gradually became denser and more organized. This
   study also showed that in postnatal rats, MDB was mainly composed of
   type I collagen fibers. By observing the development of MDB in SD rats,
   the function of MDB can be further understood. This study provides a
   morphological basis for future functional studies involving the MDB.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   In view of the current difficulty of separation of troxerutin, the
   purpose of the paper is to separate and purify semi-synthetic flavonoid
   compound troxerutin by macroporous adsorption resin (SZ-3).
   Design/methodology/approach
   Comparing the adsorption performance and resolution of three different
   polar resins and choosing a resin to optimize the process parameters
   such as sample volume, eluent concentration and elution temperature to
   obtain high-purity troxerutin. After separating and enriching by resin
   column chromatography, detected the sample by LC-MS analysis.
   Findings
   This research found that the optimal conditions of the adsorption and
   desorption were sample volume S = 90 mg/g resin, methanol concentration
   C = 25\%, T = 20 degrees C. the content of troxerutin increased
   significantly from 88\% to more than 96\%. Then confirmed the sample was
   troxerutin by LC-MS. In addition, the resin could be used for at least
   10 cycles in the separation and purification experiments of troxerutin.
   Originality/value
   Purification of troxerutin with new SZ-3 resin for the first time. Under
   the optimal conditions, the purity and recovery of troxerutin was 96.4\%
   and 39\%. In this study, the authors established a purification process
   of troxerutin successfully that was simple, economical, environment
   friendly, with high purity and high recovery rate to provide a reference
   program for changing the status of troxerutin separation difficulties.}},

   phenotypes. Haplotypes of noncoding genes (mostly lncRNAs) only improved
   the prediction accuracy over the SNP models for high density
   lipoproteins, total cholesterol, and height. ChIP-seq haplotypes had
   better prediction accuracy than gene-based haplotypes for total
   cholesterol, body mass index and low density lipoproteins. The accuracy
   of ChIP-seq haplotypes was most striking for low density lipoproteins,
   where all four haplotype models with ChIP-seq haplotypes had similarly
   high prediction accuracy over the best prediction model with gene-based
   haplotypes. Haplotype epistasis was shown to be the reason for the
   increased accuracy due to haplotypes. Low density lipoproteins had the
   largest haplotype epistasis heritability that explained 14.70\% of the
   phenotypic variance and was 31.27\% of the SNP additive heritability,
   and the largest increase in prediction accuracy relative to the best SNP
   model (8.12\%). Relative to the SNP additive heritability of the same
   regions, noncoding genes had the highest haplotype epistasis
   heritability, followed by coding genes and ChIP-seq for the seven
   phenotypes. SNP and haplotype heritability profiles showed that the
   integration of SNP and haplotype additive values compensated the
   weakness of haplotypes in estimating SNP heritabilities for four
   phenotypes, whereas models with haplotype additive values fully
   accounted for SNP additive values for three phenotypes. These results
   showed that haplotype analysis can be a method to utilize functional and
   structural genomic information to improve the accuracy of genomic
   prediction.}},

Abstract = {{Reduced tolerance to sound stimuli (hyperacusis) is commonly seen in
   tinnitus patients. Dysfunction of limbic systems, such as the nucleus
   accumbens (NAc), may be involved in emotional reactions to the sound
   stimuli in tinnitus patients. To study the functional changes in the NAc
   in hyperacusis, we have examined the neural activity changes of the NAc
   using c-Fos staining in an animal model of hyperacusis. The c-Fos
   staining was also examined in the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN), a
   central auditory pathway which has neural projections to the NAc.
   Postnatal rats (14 days) were exposed to loud noise (115 dB SPL, 4 hours
   for two consecutive days) to induce hyperacusis (n=4). Rats without
   noise exposure were used as the controls (n=4). After P35, rats in both
   groups were put in a behavioral training for sound detection. After they
   were trained to detect sound stimuli, their reaction time to noise
   bursts centered at 2 kHz (40-110 dB SPL) was measured. Rats in the noise
   group showed a significantly shorter reaction time than those in the
   control group to the noise bursts at high intensities, suggesting the
   noise exposure induced hyperacusis behavior. The c-Fos expressions in
   the NAc and the MGNs of the noise group were significantly higher than
   those of the control group. Our results suggested that early-age noise
   exposure caused hyperactivity in the NAc and the MGNs which may induce
   the loudness increase in these rats.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, the viscoelastic free vibration behavior of
   nano-scaled plates is studied by employing a finite element method based
   on the two-phase nonlocal integral theory. Various boundary conditions,
   surface effects and cutouts have been assumed. The principle of total
   potential energy is used for developing the nonlocal finite element
   method, and the classical plate theory is assumed to derive the
   formulations. By numerically solving the eigenvalue problem, which has
   been obtained by the variational principle, the complex eigenvalues of
   free vibration of the viscoelastic nano-scaled plates are acquired. The
   current results are compared with those available in the literature and
   those obtained by commercial finite element software, and the influences
   of the nonlocal parameter, viscoelastic parameter, geometrical
   parameters (e.g. cutout and size), surface effects and different
   boundary conditions on the complex eigenvalues are studied. It is noted
   that the current method is able to handle quite versatile boundary
   conditions and geometries like cutouts, which are rather difficult (or
   impossible) to be tackled by employing other methods available in most
   researches.}},

Journal = {{INNOVATION IN LANGUAGE LEARNING AND TEACHING}},
Abstract = {{The present paper aims to explore how a certain class mode emerges in
   the context of collaborative learning, which affects student motivation
   and learning. Multiple sources of data were collected from 51 high
   school students in three different classes (named A, B and C) where the
   same teacher gave them the same lesson content throughout a full year. A
   quantitative analysis of multiple questionnaire responses revealed that
   patterns of motivational change and change in perception of pair and
   group work were markedly different in the three classrooms. A
   qualitative data analysis of interviews and observations of pair and
   group activities showed that different classroom modes of regulation are
   likely to emerge even among homogenous classes consisting of students
   with the same L1 and similar proficiency levels under the same
   curriculum. The findings imply that socially-shared regulation among
   students is one of the keys to creating a positive classroom environment
   in which students influence and motivate each other.}},

Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we sought to characterize the effects of intense sensory
   stimulation on voluntary and involuntary behaviors at different stages
   of preparation for an anticipated action. We presented unexpected loud
   acoustic stimuli (LAS) at-rest and at three critical times during active
   movement preparation (-1,192, -392, and 0 ms relative to expected
   voluntary movement onset) to probe the state of the nervous system, and
   measured their effect on voluntary and involuntary motor actions
   (finger-press and eye-blink startle reflex, respectively). Voluntary
   responses were facilitated by LAS presented during active preparation,
   leading to earlier and more forceful responses compared to control and
   LAS at-rest. Notably, voluntary responses were significantly facilitated
   on trials where the LAS was presented early during preparation (-1,192
   ms). Eye-blink reflexes to the LAS at -392 ms were significantly reduced
   and delayed compared to blinks elicited at other time-points, indicating
   suppression of sub-cortical excitability. However, voluntary responses
   on these trials were still facilitated by the LAS. The results provide
   insight into the mechanisms involved in preparing anticipatory actions.
   Induced activation can persist in the nervous system and can modulate
   subsequent actions for a longer time-period than previously thought,
   highlighting that movement preparation is a continuously evolving
   process that is susceptible to external influence throughout the
   preparation period. Suppression of sub-cortical excitability shortly
   before movement onset is consistent with previous work showing
   corticospinal suppression which may be a necessary step before the
   execution of any voluntary response.}},

Title = {{Challenging Ultra Grain Refinement of Ferrite in Low-C Steel Only by
   Heat Treatment}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{It is well-known that grain refinement is one of the most effective ways
   to improve strength of metals without addition of alloying elements. In
   order to obtain bulky metals having ultrafine grained (UFG)
   microstructures with average grain sizes smaller than 1 mu m, severe
   plastic deformation (SPD) processes have made a great success. However,
   there are still big barriers to realize UFG metallic materials,
   especially UFG steels, in large scale industries, since severe plastic
   deformation processes usually need special techniques and equipment, and
   large deformation forces are required for heavy plastic deformations.
   Cyclic heat treatments to repeat martensitic transformation and
   austenitization have been known as a simple way to fabricate
   fine-grained austenitic structures in steels. In the present study, we
   tried to make final ferrite microstructures ultrafine in a low-C steel
   by means of the cyclic heat treatment. Evolution of microstructures
   during the cyclic heat treatment was systematically investigated,
   putting stress on the change of grain sizes of austenite and ferrite.
   The austenite grain size decreased with increasing the number of heat
   treatment cycles, and the minimum average austenite grain size obtained
   was 11 mu m. By having furnace-cooling from austenite states with
   various grain sizes, ferrite microstructures with different mean grain
   sizes were fabricated. We could successfully obtain a fine-grained
   ferrite structure with a mean grain size of 4.5 mu m and nearly a random
   texture through the heat treatment without deformation. Microstructural
   features and mechanical properties of the obtained fine-grained ferritic
   structures were investigated by scanning electron microscope/electron
   back-scattering diffraction measurements and a tensile test at room
   temperature. The specimens with ferrite + pearlite microstructure with
   the smallest average ferrite grain size of 4.5 mu m managed both high
   strength (yield strength of 375 MPa and tensile strength of 500 MPa) and
   large tensile ductility (uniform elongation of 20\% and total elongation
   of 39\%) in the simple 2Mn-0.1C steel.}},

Title = {{Receptoral Mechanisms for Fast Cholinergic Transmission in
   Direction-Selective Retinal Circuitry}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{Direction selectivity represents an elementary sensory computation that
   can be related to underlying synaptic mechanisms. In mammalian retina,
   direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs) respond strongly to visual
   motion in a ``preferred{''} direction and weakly to motion in the
   opposite, ``null{''} direction. The DS mechanism depends on starburst
   amacrine cells (SACs), which provide null direction-tuned GABAergic
   inhibition and untuned cholinergic excitation to DSGCs. GABAergic
   inhibition depends on conventional synaptic transmission, whereas
   cholinergic excitation apparently depends on paracrine (i.e.,
   non-synaptic) transmission. Despite its paracrine mode of transmission,
   cholinergic excitation is more transient than GABAergic inhibition,
   yielding a temporal difference that contributes essentially to the DS
   computation. To isolate synaptic mechanisms that generate the distinct
   temporal properties of cholinergic and GABAergic transmission from SACs
   to DSGCs, we optogenetically stimulated SACs while recording
   postsynaptic currents (PSCs) from DSGCs in mouse retina. Direct
   recordings from channelrhodopsin-2-expressing (ChR2(+)) SACs during
   quasi-white noise (WN) (0-30 Hz) photostimulation demonstrated precise,
   graded optogenetic control of SAC membrane current and potential. Linear
   systems analysis of ChR2-evoked PSCs recorded in DSGCs revealed
   cholinergic transmission to be faster than GABAergic transmission. A
   deconvolution-based analysis showed that distinct postsynaptic receptor
   kinetics fully account for the temporal difference between cholinergic
   and GABAergic transmission. Furthermore, GABA(A) receptor blockade
   prolonged cholinergic transmission, identifying a new functional role
   for GABAergic inhibition of SACs. Thus, fast cholinergic transmission
   from SACs to DSGCs arises from at least two distinct mechanisms,
   yielding temporal properties consistent with conventional synapses
   despite its paracrine nature.}},

Title = {{Robust experimentation in the continuous time bandit problem}},
Journal = {{ECONOMIC THEORY}},
Abstract = {{We study the experimentation dynamics of a decision maker (DM) in a
   two-armed bandit setup (Bolton and Harris in Econometrica 67(2):349-374,
   1999), where the agent holds ambiguous beliefs regarding the
   distribution of the return process of one arm and is certain about the
   other one. The DM entertains Multiplier preferences a la Hansen and
   Sargent (Am. Econ. Rev. 91(2):60-66, 2001), thus we frame the decision
   making environment as a two-player differential game against nature in
   continuous time. We characterize the DM's value function and her optimal
   experimentation strategy that turns out to follow a cut-off rule with
   respect to her belief process. The belief threshold for exploring the
   ambiguous arm is found in closed form and is shown to be increasing with
   respect to the ambiguity aversion index. We then study the effect of
   provision of an unambiguous information source about the ambiguous arm.
   Interestingly, we show that the exploration threshold rises
   unambiguously as a result of this new information source, thereby
   leading to more conservatism. This analysis also sheds light on the
   efficient time to reach for an expert opinion.}},

Abstract = {{The wild edible fruits are basic food sources and these contain
   potential dietary compounds which provide a healthy diet. Such wild
   edible fruits play an important role in supplementing the diet and
   livelihood of rural/tribal communities. Thus, the present study
   determined the nutritive values of Phoenix loureiroi fruit by screening
   the phytochemical compounds, organic acids and polyphenolics along with
   the evaluation of cytotoxic activity. The nutritional composition
   revealed high contents of total proteins (36.30 mg BSAE/g dry fruit),
   total free amino acids (6.15 mg LE/g dry fruit), reducing sugars (85.40
   mg GE/g dry fruit), vitamin E (2.50 mg TE/g dry fruit) and sodium (1.26
   mg/g dry fruit) at Rutab stage of maturation. Anti-nutritional
   compositions of fruit were found to be chymotrypsin inhibitors (3.31
   CIU/mg protein), trypsin inhibitors (0.01 TIU/mg protein) and phytate
   (0.42 g phytate/100 g dry fruit) contents. High-performance thin-layer
   chromatography (HPTLC) separation demonstrated that fruit contains a
   high amount of essential (tryptophan, 41.30 mg/g dry fruit) and
   non-essential (tyrosine, 25.70 mg/g dry fruit) amino acids. The total
   phenolics concentration was found to be 49.68 mg GAE/100 g dry fruit.
   Liquid chromatography analyses revealed that the fruit contained high
   amounts of fructose (0.12 mg/g dry fruit), ascorbic acid (2.80 mg/g dry
   fruit), catechin (3.78 mg/g dry fruit) and succinic acid (1.57 mg/g dry
   fruit). The bioactive compounds of fruit extract inhibited the
   2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical (IC50 = 8.51 mu g/mL). The
   cell viability value (65.87\%) on fibroblast L929 cell lines indicates
   fruit extract was safe up to 1000 mu g/mL concentration. The results
   revealed that the P. loureiroi fruit was rich in nutraceutical compounds
   and could be used for the development of safe natural products.}},

Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Active wildfire seasons in the western U.S. warrant the evaluation of
   post-fire forest management strategies. Ground-based salvage logging is
   often used to recover economic loss of burned timber. In unburned
   forests, ground-based logging often follows best management practices by
   leaving undisturbed areas near streams called stream buffers. However,
   the effectiveness of these buffers has not been tested in a
   post-wildfire setting. This experiment tested buffer width effectiveness
   with a novel field-simulated rill experiment using sediment-laden runoff
   (25 g/L) released over 40 min at evenly timed flow rates (50, 100 and
   150 L/min) to measure surface runoff travel length and sediment
   concentration under unburned and high and low soil burn severity
   conditions at 2-, 10- and 22-month post-fire. High severity areas
   2-month post-fire had rill lengths of up to 100 m. Rill length
   significantly decreased over time as vegetation regrowth provided ground
   cover. Sediment concentration and sediment dropout rate also varied
   significantly by soil burn severity. Sediment concentrations were 19 g/L
   for the highest flow 2-month post-fire and reduced to 6.9-14 g/L
   10-month post-fire due to abundant vegetation recovery. The amount of
   sediment dropping out of the flow consistently increased over the study
   period with the low burn severity rate of 1.15 g L-1 m(-1) approaching
   the unburned rate of 1.29 g L-1 m(-1) by 2-year post-fire. These results
   suggest that an often-used standard, 15 m buffer, was sufficient to
   contain surface runoff and reduce sediment concentration on unburned
   sites, however buffers on high burn severity sites need to be eight
   times greater (120 m) immediately after wildfire and four times greater
   (60 m) 1-year post-fire. Low burn severity areas 1-year post-fire may
   need to be only twice the width of an unburned buffer (30 m), and 2-year
   post-fire these could return to unburned widths.}},

   electron microscope (SEM). Ceramic surfaces underwent as-sintered, HF
   etching, ceramic primer, or silane applications and were observed in SEM
   and had the contact angles analyzed. The data for bond strength, failure
   mode and number of pre-test failures were analyzed by ANOVA, t-tests,
   and Chi-square tests. HFS and HFP treatments showed similar and highest
   mu SBS means in both baseline and aged conditions, and its bond strength
   was maintained after aging. The failure mode and number of pre-test
   failures were proven treatment-dependent. HF modified the ceramic
   surface and led to the lowest contact angle. MDP-containing ceramic
   primer without previous HF etching did not produce long-term bonding
   between ZLS and resin cement and did not improve the bond strength when
   HF etching was used.}},

Abstract = {{The present study aimed to estimate the prevalence of 25-OH-D status
   (insufficiency and deficiency) in children and adolescents residing in
   Bucaramanga, Colombia and to determine its association with excess
   weight. A case-control study was nested in the SIMBA II cohort in
   children and adolescents between the ages of 11 and 20 years old. Cases
   were defined as those children and adolescents with overweight or
   obesity. The control group was composed of children and adolescents from
   the same population sample with similar sociodemographic and economic
   characteristics but without overweight or obesity diagnosis.
   25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-D) was quantified in serum using a
   chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. Logistic regression models
   were used to assess the association between vitamin D status and
   overweight or obesity adjusted for the main confounding variables. A
   total of 494 children and adolescents cases were 138 (52.17\% boys and
   47.83\% girls; median age 16.0 {[}Q1 15; Q3 18]). The median BMI S-Score
   minors age in the cases was 1.36 {[}Q1 1.06; Q3 2.00] and BMI (kg/m(2))
   28.0 {[}Q1 26.2; Q3 30.8]. The prevalence of vitamin D in the cases was
   deficiency 16.67\%, insufficiency 57.25\%, sufficiency 26.09. 25-OH-D
   insufficiency was associated with overweight or obesity after adjusting
   for the main confounding variables (OR 1.73; 95\% CI 1.05-2.84). Our
   study concludes that the 25-OH-D insufficiency is common in children and
   adolescents in Bucaramanga, Colombia, and it was associated with
   overweight or obesity.}},

Abstract = {{Background There are no data on population-based epidemiological changes
   in acute myocarditis in Europe. Our aim was to evaluate temporal trends
   in incidence, clinical features and outcomes of hospital treated acute
   myocarditis (AM) in Spain from 2003 to 2015.
   Methods We conducted a retrospective longitudinal study using
   information of all hospital discharges of the Spanish National Health
   System. All episodes with a discharge diagnosis of AM from 1 January
   2003 to 31 December 2015 were included. The risk-standardized
   in-hospital mortality ratio (RSMR) was calculated using a multilevel
   risk-adjustment model developed by the Medicare and Medicaid Services.
   Temporal trends for in-hospital mortality were modelled using Poisson
   regression analysis.
   Results A total of 11 147 episodes of AM were analysed, most of them
   idiopathic (94.7\%). The rate of AM discharges increased along the
   period, from 13 to 30/million inhabitants/year (2003-2015), and this
   increase was statistically significant when weighted by age and sex
   (incidence rate ratio, IRR 1.06, 95\% CI 1.04-1.08, P = .001).
   In-hospital crude mortality rate was 3.1\%, diminishing significantly
   along 2003-2015 (IRR 0.95, 95\% CI 0.92-0.99, P = .02). RSMR also
   significantly diminished along the period (IRR 0.95, 95\% CI 0.92-0.99,
   P = .01). Renal failure (OR 7.03, 5.38-9.18, P = .001), liver disease
   (OR 4.61, 2.59-8.21, P = .001), pneumonia (OR 4.13, 2.75-6.20, P = .001)
   and heart failure (OR 1.91, 95\% CI 1.47-2.47, P = .001) were the
   strongest independent factors associated with in-hospital mortality.
   Conclusions Acute myocarditis is an uncommon entity, although hospital
   discharges have increased in Spain along the study period. Most of AM
   were idiopathic. Adjusted mortality was low and seemed to decrease from
   2003 to 2015, suggesting an improvement in AM management.}},

Abstract = {{The Walawe river basin is one of the important watersheds in Sri Lanka
   subjected to water scarcity due to intensive exploitation for irrigation
   and domestic purposes. The groundwater resource in the basin is
   under-explored for its capacity to sustain a continuous supply of water
   for future demand while facing the growing climate change challenges.
   The objective of this study was to identify the behavior of groundwater
   in the Walawe river basin that flows through two major climatic zones in
   Sri Lanka. The study approach includes hydrogeochemical and stable
   isotope analysis in order to differentiate the geochemical evolution of
   groundwater in the basin with respect to climatic factors. Water samples
   from thirty-eight (38) deep wells (> 20 m), 25 shallow wells, and 14
   surface water bodies were collected and measured for their major ions,
   and isotope ratios of delta H-2 and delta O-18. The results indicated a
   clear difference in the geochemistry of groundwater between the two
   climatic zones of the basin. The dry zone area was characterized by a
   higher content of dissolved minerals as compared to that in the wet zone
   area. Silicate weathering, calcite dissolution, and ion exchange
   processes were found to be the main control of groundwater geochemistry
   in the basin. The Ca-HCO3-type water was found to be the predominant
   water type. The isotope data suggested that the groundwater in the study
   area is recharged mainly from the northeast monsoon rain. Isotope
   characteristics also suggested that direct infiltration is prominent in
   the wet zone regions, whereas modifications of shallow groundwater by
   evaporation were dominated in the dry zone areas. The findings of the
   study suggest that water quality management in the dry zone areas of the
   basin is critical for the future sustainability of the water resource of
   the basin.}},

Abstract = {{Background Alcohol and marijuana/cannabis are frequently used
   simultaneously (i.e., SAM use). SAM use is complex, and the ways in
   which alcohol and cannabis are simultaneously used may reveal
   differential effects. The purpose of this study was to examine day-level
   effects of distinct alcohol and cannabis product combinations on
   simultaneous use and consequences on that day.
   Methods College student SAM users (N = 274; 50\% women; M-age = 19.82
   years) were recruited to complete 54 days of data collection, including
   5 repeated daily surveys each day. We identified 12 distinct product
   combinations reported during SAM-use days. We tested 4 reference groups,
   with one reflecting the most common use pattern and 3 potentially risky
   use patterns. We considered 3 outcomes (negative consequences, number of
   drinks, and number of cannabis uses) and used generalized linear
   mixed-effects models disentangling within- from between-person effects
   in all analyses.
   Results Using multiple products (>= 2) of alcohol was consistently
   linked to higher odds of experiencing a negative consequence. Combining
   beer with only one cannabis product (leaf or concentrate) was
   consistently associated with lower odds of a consequence. Combining
   cannabis with multiple alcohol products was associated with heavier
   alcohol consumption. Using dual cannabis products also was associated
   with heavier cannabis consumption, but this pattern was not
   significantly different than using concentrate only on a given day.
   Conclusion This is the first study to examine day-level influences of
   distinct alcohol and cannabis product combinations on consumption and
   consequences among young adult SAM users. Findings suggest that mixing
   alcohol products confers greater risk for negative consequences and
   heavier consumption, whereas there is little difference in cannabis
   consumption when using concentrate only vs. 2 cannabis products on a
   given day, except for concentrate + beer. Our findings support existing
   protective strategies of not mixing alcohol products and avoiding use of
   cannabis concentrate for SAM use as well.}},

Abstract = {{The Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership was
   established in 2010 to support teaching quality and leadership in
   schools and initial teacher education programs. Early on it produced
   seven Australian Professional Standards for Teachers affecting
   professional knowledge, professional practice, and professional
   engagement. Standard 4 is part of professional practice and requires
   teachers to create and maintain supportive and safe school learning
   environments. We propose that Standard 4 has implications geographers
   have yet to fully consider, and here our aim is to surface and examine
   its latent spatialities. We conceive of supportive and safe learning
   environments as crucial infrastructures of care that can be made more
   legible using established spatial typologies. To support this
   proposition, we draw on empirical evidence from a study of literacy
   teaching practice in Tasmanian government schools and of initial teacher
   education programs. Here, we focus on how participants described the
   importance of school learning environments for students' educational
   attainment and social and emotional wellbeing. We conclude that spatial
   lenses are important in thinking about these environments and could
   effectively support teachers to demonstrate career-long and increasingly
   sophisticated capacities to perceive, use, create, and help others make
   the most of such spaces for diverse learning outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To evaluate the impact of a mother-role development program on
   postpartum health-service utilization by adolescent mothers.
   Methods A single center, parallel, randomized, controlled, open-label
   trial using a computer-generated sequence was conducted at Siriraj
   Hospital. In all, 120 teenage mothers who delivered February
   2015-December 2016 were randomized into experimental and control groups.
   The experimental group participated in a 2-year, mother-role development
   program at the Young Family Clinic. The two groups' characteristics,
   pregnancy outcomes and postpartum follow-up details over the 2-year
   period were compared. The main outcome measure was the utilization of
   maternal healthcare services (MHS).
   Results The teenage mothers were randomized into two groups of 60
   participants each. Many were progressively lost to follow-up, leaving
   only 37 (experimental group, 19; control group, 18) for the
   intention-to-treat analysis. The results demonstrated a higher MHS
   utilization by the experimental group, but only at the 6-week postpartum
   follow-up. The usage of long-acting, reversible contraception (birth
   control implants and intrauterine devices) rose from 53.3\% (immediate
   postpartum) to 95.5\% (2 years postpartum). The two groups also had
   identical repeat pregnancy rates (6.67\%; four participants in each), a
   marked decrease from 20\% in a prior study. The breastfeeding rate was
   consistently higher among the mothers undertaking the mother-role
   development program.
   Conclusion The program increased both MHS utilization during the initial
   postpartum period and the breastfeeding duration. Access to immediate
   postpartum contraception and long-acting, reversible contraception was
   associated with a reduction in repeat teen pregnancies. Having a
   multidisciplinary team was key to the health-service improvements.}},

Abstract = {{In order to distinguish different varieties of Lycium barbarum
   effectively, a fast nondestructive detection method based on
   hyperspectral imaging technology was proposed. Six varieties of L.
   barbarum were selected as the research objects to obtain hyperspectral
   images. With the whole L. barbarum taken as the object, the region of
   interest was obtained by threshold segmentation, and the average spectra
   value of the image points of a single L. barbarum was extracted as the
   spectral data of the sample. Initially, standard normalized variate was
   used to preprocess the original spectral data. Furthermore, compared
   with other methods, competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) was
   chosen to extract the characteristic wavelengths. Additionally, the
   model of support vector machine (SVM) was set. The results showed that
   the SVM model based on CARS had the best classification effect. The
   training set accuracy was 100\%, and the prediction set accuracy was
   85\%. Finally, in order to improve the classification accuracy, the
   whale optimization algorithm (WOA) was introduced. The accuracy of
   training set and prediction set obtained by WOA-SVM model were 89.44 and
   88.33\% respectively. Therefore, it was feasible to use hyperspectral
   imaging technology combined with CARS-WOA-SVM model to identify
   different varieties of L. barbarum.}},

Abstract = {{In the age of artificial intelligence, firms' internal data are
   increasingly valuable when merged with each other for inter-firm
   analysis and predictions. However, the inter-firm data transactions
   represent a novel challenge on pricing due to the complex nature of
   data, such as quality information asymmetry, lack of pricing standards,
   and the negligible marginal cost. This paper conducts a case study at
   Shanghai Data Exchange to explore the factors that can facilitate the
   data transactions between buyers and providers. We use interview
   transcripts from 18 participating firms to construct our three
   theoretical dimensions: increasing the perceived value, mitigating the
   cost, and improving the market design. We then browse through 18 factors
   to assess their value for further improvements. The managerial
   implications are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Background There are only a few reports evaluating the applicability of
   endothelial-damage markers analysis by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in
   kidney allograft samples. This study analyzed the expression of
   Caveolin-1 (Cav), von Willebrand factor (Vwf), and T-cadherin (Cad) in
   kidney biopsies and their association with antibody-mediated injury.
   Methods In this retrospective study, 114 cases with antibody-mediated
   changes (Banff, 2020) and 72 with interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy
   were selected. IHC for Cav, Vwf and Cad was performed and evaluated
   according to their qualitative expression in peritubular capillaries.
   The cases were grouped according to the presence of microvascular
   inflammation (MVI), donor-specific antibodies (DSA), C4d positivity and
   antibody-mediated rejection (AMR). A level of significance < 0.05 was
   adopted. Results Vwf expression was associated with MVI (p < 0.001), DSA
   (p = 0.016), C4d (p < 0.001) and AMR (p < 0.001), and was higher in
   DSA+/C4d+ cases despite MVI (p < 0.001). The expression of Cad
   correlated with MVI (p = 0.015), C4d (p = 0.005) and AMR (p = < 0.001).
   Cad was more expressed in chronic AMR compared with acute/active cases
   (p = 0.001). Cav expression was associated with MVI (p = 0.029) and AMR
   (p = 0.016) and was also higher in chronic AMR (p = 0.049). A combined
   score of Vwf and Cad was higher in AMR when compared with C4d without
   rejection and IF/TA cases (p < 0.001). Conclusion Vwf, Cad and Cav
   expression shows association with antibody-mediated injury and may be
   helpful to support AMR diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{Density functional theory and Boltzmann transport equations are used to
   investigate electronic band structure and thermoelectric (TE) properties
   of different two-dimensional (2D) materials containing Mo, S, Nb, Se,
   and Te. In MoS2-based monolayers (MLs) the substitution of S atoms by Te
   atoms up to the concentration of 12.5 at\% leads to a more significant
   change of the band structure than in the corresponding case with Se
   atoms. In particular, the bandgap is reduced. At a high concentration of
   Se or Te the electronic structure becomes more similar to that of the
   SeMoS or TeMoS Janus layers, and the MoSe2 or MoTe2 MLs. It is found
   that local and random introduction of substitutional Se or Te atoms
   yields not very different results. The substitution of Mo by Nb, at the
   concentration of 2.1 at\% leads to hole levels. The thermoelectric
   properties of the considered 2D materials are quantified by the Seebeck
   coefficient and thermoelectric figure of merit. The two characteristics
   are determined for different levels of p- or n-doping of the MLs and for
   different temperatures. Compared to the pristine MoS2 ML, Te
   substitutional atoms cause more changes of the thermoelectric properties
   than Se atoms. However, MLs with Se substitutional atoms show a high
   thermoelectric figure of merit in a broader range of possible p- or
   n-doping levels. In most cases, the maximum thermoelectric figure of
   merit is about one, both in p- and n-type materials, and for
   temperatures between 300 and 1200 K. This is not only found for
   MoS2-based MLs with substitutional atoms but also for the Janus layers
   and for MoSe2 or MoTe2 MLs. Interestingly, for MLs with one Nb as well
   as two or four Te substitutional atoms the highest values of the TE
   figure of merit of 1.2 and 1.40, respectively, are obtained at a
   temperature of 1200 K.}},

Abstract = {{Adsorption kinetics models have been used to evaluate the adsorption
   behaviour of pollutants on different materials but there are no reports
   for the adsorption of As5+, As3+, Sb3+ and Hg2+ on co-precipitated
   akaganeite nanoparticles which were previously formed in the presence of
   these ions. In this research, the performance of pure and
   co-precipitated akaganeite nanoparticles as adsorbents of As3+, As5+,
   Sb3+ and Hg2+ in aqueous solutions was evaluated using the nonlinear
   kinetics models of Langmuir, Lagergren, Ho-McKay, Bangham, Elovich and
   simplified Elovich. In addition, transmission Fe-57 Mossbauer
   spectrometry was used for the first time to compare the physico-chemical
   properties of akaganeite before and after the adsorption processes. The
   results showed that co-precipitated akaganeites had much better
   adsorption capacities than pure akaganeites. On the other hand, the Sb3+

Abstract = {{Innate immune memory responses (also termed ``trained immunity{''}) have
   been described in monocytes after BCG vaccination and after stimulation
   in vitro with microbial and endogenous ligands such as LPS, beta-glucan,
   oxidized LDL, and monosodium urate crystals. However, whether clinical
   infections are also capable of inducing a trained immunity phenotype
   remained uncertain. We evaluated whether Plasmodium falciparum infection
   can induce innate immune memory by measuring monocyte-derived cytokine
   production from five volunteers undergoing Controlled Human Malaria
   Infection. Monocyte responses followed a biphasic pattern: during acute
   infection, monocytes produced lower amounts of inflammatory cytokines
   upon secondary stimulation, but 36 days after malaria infection they
   produced significantly more IL-6 and TNF-alpha in response to various
   stimuli. Furthermore, transcriptomic and epigenomic data analysis
   revealed a clear reprogramming of monocytes at both timepoints, with
   long-term changes of H3K4me3 at the promoter regions of inflammatory
   genes that remain present for several weeks after parasite clearance.
   These findings demonstrate an epigenetic basis of trained immunity
   induced by human malaria in vivo.}},

   cancer surgery without breast reconstruction}},
Journal = {{BREAST CANCER}},

Abstract = {{Background Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) occur in up to 30
   percent of patients after breast cancer surgery despite routine
   administration of antiemetic prophylaxis. A history of nausea and
   vomiting during pregnancy (NVP) has been reported as a risk factor of
   intraoperative nausea and vomiting in caesarean delivery. Nevertheless,
   whether a history of severe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy (SNVP)
   is associated with a higher occurrence of PONV remains unclear. Methods
   In this study, 121 sequential female patients who were scheduled to
   undergo breast cancer surgery were assigned to study group (30 cases,
   with SNVP) or control group (91 cases, with mild NVP (MNVP)). The
   incidence of PONV and the need for rescue antiemetic were recorded in
   post-anesthesia care unit (PACU), at 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 36 h after
   operation. Moreover, postoperative pain, level of satisfaction, and the
   relationship of ER/PR status in breast cancer tissue with SNVP and PONV
   were also investigated. Results Data from 115 patients were analyzed.
   The incidence of PONV in the SNVP group was significantly higher than
   that in the MNVP group at 6 h (P < 0.005), 12 h (P < 0.05), and 24 h
   after the operation (P < 0.05). The incidence of PONV in the MNVP group
   was approximately 30\% lower than in the SNVP group. Besides, more
   severe PONV, a larger number of demands for rescue antiemetic, fewer
   patient satisfaction scores, and more dizziness were observed in the
   SNVP group. Yet, no relationship was found between ER/PR status of
   breast cancer tissue and SNVP or PONV. Conclusions Compared to patients
   with MNVP, those with a history of SNVP experienced a higher incidence
   of PONV and severe PONV, presented with a larger number of requirements
   for postoperative antiemetic and a lower level of satisfaction.}},

Title = {{Urban village on a global scale: Diverse interpretations of one label}},
Journal = {{URBAN GEOGRAPHY}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, ``urban village{''} has become a heated topic in urban
   research on informal settlements in the Global South, particularly in
   the Chinese context. However, this critical review uncovers that at
   least three different interpretations of urban village exist in the
   literature: ethnic enclaves in American metropolises, new models of
   community development in the Anglosphere, and informal settlements
   within the rapidly expanding metropolises in the Global South. In
   tackling the complexity of the urban village discourse, this study
   employs fundamental linguistic knowledge to probe the urban village in
   cross-disciplinary, cross-cultural, and cross-linguistic contexts. The
   resulting argument is that urban village is a label that denotes diverse
   ideas. This work expands the discussion on the flexibility and
   mutability of popular keywords in the contemporary discourse on urban
   research.}},

Title = {{Experience of Filipinos with Spinal Cord Injury in the Use of Assistive
   Technology: An Occupational Justice Perspective}},
Journal = {{OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{Assistive technology (AT) is often required to facilitate the
   performance of occupations and promote inclusion and reduction of
   dependency among persons with spinal cord injury (SCI). However, only
   5-15\% of individuals in developing countries have access to AT. This
   study is aimed at exploring the experience of Filipinos with SCI as they
   use AT and understand these from an occupational justice (OJ)
   perspective. This study utilised a hermeneutic phenomenological approach
   to explore the participants' experiences with AT usage. Ten participants
   were recruited from a hospital and communities within Metro Manila,
   Philippines, and interviewed last January 2020. Hermeneutic analysis was
   done to interpret the shared meaning embedded within their experiences
   and was informed by an occupational justice perspective. Exploring the
   experience of the participants in using AT yielded four themes, namely,
   (1) engaging in occupations despite limited opportunities, (2) going to
   various locations amidst an inaccessible environment, (3) striving
   towards inclusion in spite of attitudinal barriers, and (4) securing
   needs in light of unfavourable life conditions. Filipinos with SCI deal
   with numerous structural and contextual factors in daily life. There has
   been partial enablement of OJ as they incorporate AT in their daily
   lives as occupational rights are far from being recognised and
   respected. In infusing an OJ perspective to understanding AT use, OT
   practitioners are bound to identify problems and courses of action that
   go beyond traditional service delivery.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY}},

Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is rapidly becoming a major chronic
   liver disease worldwide. However, little is known concerning the
   pathogenesis and progression mechanism of NASH. Our aim here is to
   identify key genes and elucidate their biological function in the
   progression from hepatic steatosis to NASH.
   Methods
   Gene expression datasets containing NASH patients, hepatic steatosis
   patients, and healthy subjects were downloaded from the Gene Expression
   Omnibus database, using the R packages biobase and GEOquery.
   Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the R limma
   package. Functional annotation and enrichment analysis of DEGs were
   undertaken using the R package ClusterProfile. Protein-protein
   interaction (PPI) networks were constructed using the STRING database.
   Results
   Three microarray datasets GSE48452, GSE63067 and GSE89632 were selected.
   They included 45 NASH patients, 31 hepatic steatosis patients, and 43
   healthy subjects. Two up-regulated and 24 down-regulated DEGs were found
   in both NASH patients vs. healthy controls and in steatosis subjects vs.
   healthy controls. The most significantly differentially expressed genes
   were FOSB (P = 3.43x10(-15)), followed by CYP7A1 (P = 2.87x10(-11)), and
   FOS (P = 6.26x10(-11)). Proximal promoter DNA-binding transcription
   activator activity, RNA polymerase II-specific (P = 1.30x10(-5)) was the
   most significantly enriched functional term in the gene ontology
   analysis. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis indicated that the MAPK
   signaling pathway (P = 3.11x10(-4)) was significantly enriched.
   Conclusion
   This study characterized hub genes of the liver transcriptome, which may
   contribute functionally to NASH progression from hepatic steatosis.}},

Abstract = {{We present a case of clear cell sarcoma (CCS) on the left large toe of
   an 80-year-old female. CCS, also known as ``melanoma of soft parts,{''}
   is a rare soft tissue neoplasm that exhibits melanocytic
   differentiation. Most cases occur on the distal extremities of young
   female adults. CCS shares histopathologic and immunohistochemical
   features with malignant melanoma that cause diagnostic difficulties
   distinguishing between these entities; therefore, cytogenetic studies of
   specific translocations are paramount in obtaining the correct
   diagnosis. The majority of CCS cases reveal a t(12;22)(q13;q12)
   EWSR1/ATF1 translocation, while a rare subset of CCS demonstrate a
   t(2;22) (q32:q12) EWS/CREB1 translocation. Our patient presented with a
   50-year history of a nodule on the dorsum of her left large toe, with
   increasing size and tenderness over the past nine months. Histopathology
   and immunoperoxidase staining indicated CCS as a differential diagnosis.
   Cytogenetic analysis revealed a translocation in t(2;22) (q32;q12)
   resulting in the EWSR1/CREB1 gene, confirming a diagnosis of CCS. The
   translocation, histologic location, and long-standing clinical course
   exhibited in this case are exceptionally rare, and we hope to inform
   dermatologists of an uncommon presentation of CCS in an unexpected age
   group.}},

Abstract = {{In elderly patients (pts) with aggressive B cell lymphoma (aNHL),
   curative treatment often cannot be administered because of comorbidities
   and tolerability. We analyzed the influence of age in pts > 60 years
   receiving the R-CHOP-14 regimen within different prospective DSHNHL
   trials. Of the RICOVER-60 trial and CHOP-R-ESC trials, 1171 aNHL pts
   were included in this retrospective analysis of age-dependent event-free
   survival (EFS), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival
   (OS). All patients received prophylactic G-CSF, and anti-infective
   prophylaxis with amphotericin B mouth wash and oral fluorchinolone was
   optional. In the CHOP-R-ESC trials, prophylaxis was augmented to include
   mandatory continuous orally administered aciclovir and a pneumocystis
   prophylaxis with cotrimoxazole as well as oral fluorchinolones during
   neutropenia. The patient population was separated into 4 age groups
   (61-65 years, 66-70 years, 71-75 years, and 76-80 years). The results
   from the RICOVER-60 trial were subsequently confirmed in the following
   CHOP-R-ESC trials by a multivariate analysis adjusted for IPI factors
   and gender. Significant differences (p < 0.001) in EFS, PFS, and OS were
   seen between age groups (RICOVER-60). Hematotoxicity, infections, and
   TRM increased with age. TRM was significantly elevated in the age group
   76-80 years. Therefore, this analysis shows that an age above 75 years
   defines an especially vulnerable patient population when being treated
   with chemoimmunotherapy for aNHL. Prophylactic anti-infective drugs are
   essential and clinically effective in reducing morbidity when treating
   elderly aNHL pts.}},

Abstract = {{As the substitution of common noble catalysts in the hydrogenation of
   carboxylic acid, a highly effective Cu-Ni/SiO2 catalyst was prepared by
   a novel stepwise ammonia evaporation method. Its performance in the
   gasphase hydrogenation of acetic acid was further examined. With the
   introduction of Ni dopant, more stable Cu delta+ sites, which can adsorb
   more acetic acid, were formed due to the electron transfer from Cu to
   Ni. This makes more Cu-0 sites available for hydrogen adsorption, which
   was suggested as the rate-determining step in acetic acid hydrogenation.
   A conversion of 99.6\% was successfully achieved on this new
   Cu/SiO2-0.5Ni catalyst, accompanied by the ethanol selectivity of 90\%.
   The incorporation of nickel between copper nanoparticles enhances the
   synergistic effect between Cu-0 and Cu+. It also helps mitigate the
   aggregation of copper nanoparticles due to the Ostwald ripening effect
   induced by acetic acid and enhance the stability of copper catalyst in
   the conversion of carboxylic acid.}},

Title = {{FMNL1 Exhibits Pro-Metastatic Activity via CXCR2 in Clear Cell Renal
   Cell Carcinoma}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{Formin-like (FMNL) proteins are responsible for cytoskeletal remodeling
   and have been implicated in the progression and spread of human cancers.
   Yet the clinical significance and biological function of FMNL1 in clear
   cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) remain unclear. In this study, the
   expression of FMNL1 in ccRCC and its clinical value were determined by
   tissue microarray-based IHC and statistical analyses. The role of FMNL1
   in ccRCC metastasis and the underlying mechanism were investigated via
   in vitro and in vivo models using gene regulation detection, ChIP,
   Luciferase reporter assays, and rescue experiments. We show that FMNL1
   is upregulated in ccRCC and exhibits pro-metastatic activity via
   induction of CXCR2. High expression of FMNL1 is significantly correlated
   with advanced tumor stage, higher pathological tumor grade, tumor
   metastasis, and unfavorable prognosis in two independent cohorts
   containing over 800 patients with ccRCC. The upregulation of FMNL1 in
   ccRCC is mediated by the loss of GATA3. Ectopic expression of FMNL1
   promotes, whereas FMNL1 depletion inhibits cell migration in vitro and
   tumor metastasis in vivo. The FMNL1-enhanced cell mobility is markedly
   attenuated by the knockdown of CXCR2. Further studies demonstrate that
   FMNL1 increases the expression of CXCR2 via HDAC1. In clinical samples,
   FMNL1 expression is positively associated with CXCR2, and is negatively
   connected to GATA3 expression. Collectively, our data suggest FMNL1
   serve as a potential prognostic factor and function as an oncogene. The
   axis of GATA3/FMNL1/CXCR2 may present a promising therapeutic target for
   tumor metastasis in ccRCC.}},

Abstract = {{NiFe layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) nanosheets and
   metal-nitrogen-carbon materials (M-N-C, M = Ni, Fe, Co, etc.) are
   supreme catalysts in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen
   reduction reaction (ORR) process, respectively. Nevertheless, the
   monotonic performance and insufficient stability severely hamper their
   practical application in rechargeable batteries. Herein, we
   simultaneously combine ultrathin NiFe-LDH nanowalls with renewable
   soybean-derived Fe-N-C matrix to obtain a hybrid materials
   (NiFe-LDH/FeSoy-CNSs-A), which exhibits robust catalytic activities for
   OER (E-j=10 = 1.53 V vs. RHE) and ORR (E-1/2 = 0.91 V vs. RHE), with a
   top-notch battery parameters and stability in assembled rechargeable
   Zn-air batteries. Intensive investigations indicate that the vertically
   dispersed NiFe-LDH nanosheets, Fe-N-C matrix derived from soybean and
   the strong synergy between them are responsible for the unprecedented
   OER and ORR performances. The key role of intrinsic N defects involved
   in the hybrid materials is firstly specified by ultrasoundassisted
   extraction of soy protein from soybean. The exquisite design can
   facilitate the utilization of sustainable biomass-derived catalysts, and
   the mechanism investigations of N defects and oxygenic groups on the
   structure-activity relationship can stimulate the progress of other
   functional hybrid electrocatalysts.}},

Abstract = {{Background Medication refusal in children is largely driven by aversive
   taste profiles, which in turn influence adherence and therapeutic
   outcomes. However, there are no standardized methods for evaluating
   taste in young children. This study compares facial recognition
   technology with three hedonic visual scales in this population. Methods
   Children, 3-7 years of age, were enrolled with informed parental
   permission into an institutional review board-approved, double-blind,
   randomized investigation. Each child received three test articles:
   prednisone (bitter), simple syrup (sweet), and filtered water (neutral),
   with an appropriate washout. Facial recognition software (Noldus
   FaceReader 7) recorded facial expression and intensity for 30-60 s after
   administration. Participants subsequently rated taste using three
   hedonic scales (5-point Sjovall and 5- and 3-point TASTY) and responded
   to simple questions on their perception of the test article. Repeated
   measures analysis of variance and multiple regression analysis were used
   to explore associations between palatability measures. Results Twelve
   children (seven males: ten white and two black) completed the study
   without adverse effects. There were no significant differences in
   participant characteristics by randomization sequence. The three hedonic
   scales tracked similarly for each test substance, with correlations
   between the 5-point scales (r = 0.899) comparable to those between the
   3- and 5-point scales (r = 0.860-0.903). Hedonic scales appeared more
   reliable in assessing taste response than facial recognition, which did
   not effectively discriminate positive and negative responses.
   Conclusions Our experience suggests that the TASTY scales appear to
   offer the greatest promise for assessing palatability in future clinical
   use.}},

Abstract = {{Thermoelastic damping is a prominent internal dissipation mechanism in
   small-scale mechanical resonators. It has been given a lot of attention
   recently due to the endeavors to design high-quality
   nanoelectromechanical systems. In the article, this phenomenon is
   analyzed for in-plane vibration of orthotropic and isotropic nanoplate
   resonators using coupled nonlocal heat conduction and nonlocal
   elasticity theories. The obtained thermal-displacement equations are
   solved using the Galerkin residual technique and the output results are
   illustrated and compared for isotropic and orthotropic materials, using
   the classical theory, the nonlocal elasticity theory, the nonlocal heat
   conduction theory, and coupled nonlocal thermoelasticity. The results
   show significant impacts of both the nanosystem geometrical and physical
   parameters on the quality factor.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents the cascaded variable structure control approach
   with respect to the non-minimum phase nature of the DC-DC Z-source

   technique for output voltage regulation. The control-to-output transfer
   function of the ZSC contains a right-half-plane (RHP) zero in continuous
   conduction mode. The RHP zero, obtained by a linearised small-signal
   model, results in frequency response limitation. In this case, the
   converter output voltage control should be studied regarding to the RHP
   zero effect. To alleviate this effect and enhance the dynamic
   performance, the cascaded sliding mode control method is proposed. The
   cascaded sliding mode controller guarantees asymptotically minimum phase
   stability as well as robustness against input voltage variation and load
   resistance uncertainty. The capability and effectiveness of the proposed

Abstract = {{A classical result from analytic number theory by Rademacher gives an
   exact formula for the Fourier coefficients of modular forms of
   non-positive weight. We apply similar techniques to study the spectrum
   of two-dimensional unitary conformal field theories, with no extended
   chiral algebra and c > 1. By exploiting the full modular constraints of
   the partition function we propose an expression for the spectral density
   in terms of the light spectrum of the theory. The expression is given in
   terms of a Rademacher expansion, which converges for spin j not equal 0.
   For a finite number of light operators the expression agrees with a
   variant of the Poincare construction developed by Maloney, Witten and
   Keller. With this framework we study the presence of negative density of
   states in the partition function dual to pure gravity, and propose a
   scenario to cure this negativity.}},

Title = {{Thermal performance and stress analysis of heat spreaders for immersion
   cooling applications}},
Journal = {{APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{181}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{This paper numerically investigates the thermal performance and stress
   analysis of enhanced Copper (Cu) spreaders for nucleate boiling
   immersion cooling of high-power electronic chips. The proposed spreaders
   take advantage of the remarkably high thermal conductivity of Cu (low
   thermal spreading resistance) and enhanced nucleate boiling heat
   transfer of dielectric liquid PF-5060 on Microporous Cu (MPC) coating.
   The spreaders topmost surfaces are smooth (Ra = 0.21 mu m), roughened
   (Ra = 1.44 mu m), and coated with an 80-mu m thick MPC layer. The
   spreader thicknesses (delta(Cu)) varied between 1.6 and 3.2 mm, the chip
   side length (L-C) between 10 and 30 mm, and chip thickness (delta(C))
   between 200 and 500 mu m. The numerical results show that MPC spreaders
   remove the most significant quantity of thermal power (58-270 W)
   dissipated by underlying chips compared to plane (smooth and roughened)
   Cu spreaders (28-210 W). The MPC spreaders have the least total thermal
   resistance, and the corresponding maximum chip temperature (T-c,T-max)
   is low (67 degrees C) and in a considerable safe margin from the
   temperature limits set by the high-power chip industry (85-120 degrees
   C). The maximum Von-Mises stress (70 MPa) on the underlying chips cooled
   by MPC spreaders is 1/100 of the allowable yield strength of silicon (7
   GPa) but much higher than those cooled by plane Cu spreaders (40-44
   MPa). The total displacement or deformation due to the temperature
   gradient is 22 mu m and 4 mu m at the top face of the spreader and at
   the chip-spreader interface, respectively, for MPC spreaders cooling 500
   mu m thick 10 x 10 mm underlying chips. The total displacement is much
   less (< 0.5 mu m) for all chips cooled by plane Cu spreaders or larger
   footprint area underlying chips (L-C = 20-30 mm) cooled by MPC
   spreaders. These numerical results demonstrate the capability of MPC
   spreaders for immersion cooling by nucleate boiling of dielectric liquid
   PF-5060 of high-power electronic chips.}},

Title = {{Factors influencing cumulative radiation dose from percutaneous

   disease}},
Journal = {{ABDOMINAL RADIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Purpose Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at risk for
   intra-abdominal abscesses requiring CT-guided drainage. These patients
   are at baseline risk of high cumulative radiation exposure from imaging,
   which may be exacerbated by CT-guided drainage. This study aimed to
   determine the radiation dose associated with percutaneous drainage in
   the setting of IBD and identify risk factors associated with high
   exposure. Methods An IRB-approved single-center retrospective study was
   performed to identify patients with IBD who underwent percutaneous
   abscess drainage over a 5-year period. An episode of drainage was
   defined from drain placement to removal, with all intervening procedures
   and diagnostic CT scans included in the cumulative radiation dose.
   Results The mean cumulative effective dose for a drainage episode was
   47.50 mSv. The mean duration of a drainage episode was 68.7 days.
   Patients with a cumulative dose greater than 50 mSv required higher
   number of follow-up visits compared to patients with less than 50 mSv
   (6.9 vs. 3.5, p = 0.003{*}). Patients with higher cumulative dose were
   also more likely to require drain upsize (54\% vs. 13\%, p = 0.01{*}) or
   additional drain placement (63\% vs 24\%, p = 0.03{*}) compared to
   patients with lower dose. Conclusion Intra-abdominal abscess drainage
   may be associated with significant cumulative radiation exposure.
   Requirement of drain upsizing or additional drain placement were
   associated with higher cumulative radiation dose, which may be related
   to more severe underlying inflammatory bowel disease.}},

   performance via OVAL, a novel auditory orthography optimized for
   visual-to-auditory mapping}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Reading is a unique human cognitive skill and its acquisition was proven
   to extensively affect both brain organization and neuroanatomy.
   Differently from western sighted individuals, literacy rates via tactile
   reading systems, such as Braille, are declining, thus imposing an
   alarming threat to literacy among non-visual readers. This decline is
   due to many reasons including the length of training needed to master
   Braille, which must also include extensive tactile sensitivity
   exercises, the lack of proper Braille instruction and the high costs of
   Braille devices. The far-reaching consequences of low literacy rates,
   raise the need to develop alternative, cheap and easy-to-master
   non-visual reading systems. To this aim, we developed OVAL, a new
   auditory orthography based on a visual-to-auditory sensory-substitution
   algorithm. Here we present its efficacy for successful words-reading,
   and investigation of the extent to which redundant features defining
   characters (i.e., adding specific colors to letters conveyed into
   audition via different musical instruments) facilitate or impede
   auditory reading outcomes. Thus, we tested two groups of blindfolded
   sighted participants who were either exposed to a monochromatic or to a
   color version of OVAL. First, we showed that even before training, all
   participants were able to discriminate between 11 OVAL characters
   significantly more than chance level. Following 6 hours of specific OVAL
   training, participants were able to identify all the learned characters,
   differentiate them from untrained letters, and read short
   words/pseudo-words of up to 5 characters. The Color group outperformed
   the Monochromatic group in all tasks, suggesting that redundant
   characters' features are beneficial for auditory reading. Overall, these
   results suggest that OVAL is a promising auditory-reading tool that can
   be used by blind individuals, by people with reading deficits as well as
   for the investigation of reading specific processing dissociated from
   the visual modality.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological assessment of lakes and rivers using benthic diatom
   assemblages currently requires considerable taxonomic expertise to
   identify species using light microscopy. This traditional approach is
   also time-consuming. Diatom metabarcoding is a promising alternative and
   there is increasing interest in using this approach for routine
   assessment. However, until now, analysis protocols for diatom
   metabarcoding have been developed and optimised by research groups
   working in isolation. The diversity of existing bioinformatics methods
   highlights the need for an assessment of the performance and
   comparability of results of different methods. The aim of this study was
   to test the correspondence of outputs from six bioinformatics pipelines
   currently in use for diatom metabarcoding in different European
   countries. Raw sequence data from 29 biofilm samples were treated by
   each of the bioinformatics pipelines, five of them using the same
   curated reference database. The outputs of the pipelines were compared
   in terms of sequence unit assemblages, taxonomic assignment, biotic
   index score and ecological assessment outcomes. The three last
   components were also compared to outputs from traditional light
   microscopy, which is currently accepted for ecological assessment of
   phytobenthos, as required by the Water Framework Directive. We also
   tested the performance of the pipelines on the two DNA markers (rbcL and
   185-V4) that are currently used by the working groups participating in
   this study. The sequence unit assemblages produced by different
   pipelines showed significant differences in terms of assigned and
   unassigned read numbers and sequence unit numbers. When comparing the
   taxonomic assignments at genus and species level, correspondence of the
   taxonomic assemblages between pipelines was weak. Most discrepancies
   were linked to differential detection or quantification of taxa, despite
   the use of the same reference database. Subsequent calculation of biotic
   index scores also showed significant differences between approaches,
   which were reflected in the final ecological assessment. Use of the rbcL
   marker always resulted in better correlation among molecular datasets
   and also in results closer to these generated using traditional
   microscopy. This study shows that decisions made in pipeline design have
   implications for the dataset's structure and the taxonomic assemblage,
   which in turn may affect biotic index calculation and ecological
   assessment. There is a need to define best-practice bioinformatics
   parameters in order to ensure the best representation of diatom
   assemblages. Only the use of similar parameters will ensure the
   compatibility of data from different working groups. The future of
   diatom metabarcoding for ecological assessment may also lie in the
   development of new metrics using, for example, presence/absence instead
   of relative abundance data. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC LEADERSHIP}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{178-195}},

Abstract = {{Purpose This article asks (1) what megatrends are likely to
   significantly influence public sector roles and in what ways and (2) how
   might higher education institutions better prepare public sector leaders
   for the future shaped by these trends. While public sector leadership in
   every region, country and locality is unique, they are exposed to the
   same set of global megatrends. Therefore, this article teases out
   general insights, observations and implications for public sector
   leaders and educators by focusing on the effects of these trends.
   Design/methodology/approach The article is informed by a review and
   synthesis of relevant academic and practitioner sources and is
   complemented by the authors' survey (n = 64) of public affairs
   practitioners and educators. The survey is not representative and is
   used to supplement other inferences from the literature. Findings The
   key megatrends reshaping public sector jobs include demographic and
   climate changes, technological advances and deepening social
   fragmentation. The confluence of such trends has increasingly strained
   the public sector's capacity to respond to present challenges, let alone
   prepare for the future. The future public sector leaders can benefit
   from new competencies, including ability to think systematically, see
   the big picture and ability to solve complex problems. Ideally, they
   would also have a strong capacity to foster collaboration and cohesion
   among diverse stakeholders, to model ethical and inclusive behavior, to
   accommodate, facilitate and bridge competing and conflicting viewpoints
   and become creative innovators and doers who can operate in increasingly
   complex environments, while navigating and reshaping their governments'
   outdated institutional structures. Research limitations/implications The
   key trends reshaping public sector jobs include environmental,
   demographic and technological factors and deepening social
   fragmentation. The confluence of such factors has increasingly strained
   the public sector's capacity to respond to present challenges, let alone
   prepare for the future. The authors observe that the future of public
   sector practitioners may benefit from new competencies including digital
   and data fluency, high emotional intelligence, who are also big picture
   thinkers who understand global megatrends and their impacts locally.
   Ideally, they would have a strong capacity to foster cohesion among
   fragmented and polarized communities, to model ethical and inclusive
   behavior, to accommodate, facilitate and bridge diverse viewpoints and
   become creative innovators and doers who can operate in increasingly
   complex environments, while navigating and reshaping their governments'
   outdated institutional structures. Practical implications The megatrends
   listed above have significant implications for public sector leaders and
   educators who train them. Social implications There is a new awareness
   about the need to train public sector workers on diversity and inclusion
   issues. This paper discusses global trends through this lens.
   Originality/value This synthesis of the literature from academic and
   practitioner sources, supplemented with the original survey of educators
   and professionals, intends to open up a conversation about the future of
   public affairs leadership and education.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Application of control agents to prevent new infections is an integral
   part of disease management for fire blight on pome trees caused by
   Erwinia amylovora (Burrill) Winslow et al.. Due to resistance
   development and human health concerns when using antibiotics,
   non-antibiotic control agents with high efficacy are urgently needed. In
   this study extensive efficacy tests with some classical antibiotic and
   relatively new non-antibiotic control agents for the prevention of bloom
   and shoot blight as well as phytotoxicity tests based on fruit russeting
   were carried out using young apple trees. Furthermore an experimental
   design for testing control agents preventing fire blight following hail
   injury was developed. The high efficacy of streptomycin (> 90\%) and
   streptomycin containing spray strategies (> 80\%) was confirmed.
   Non-antibiotic agents with high efficacy are LMA (85\%), a potassium
   aluminum sulfate, and Juglon (80\%). LMA is already in use in practice
   in Austria and Germany with a temporal and restricted permission and the
   administrative process to gain the legal status of a pesticide is
   ongoing whilst already admitted in Switzerland. Juglon, an organic
   compound from walnut, did show a high efficacy, but no consistent
   results (80.0 and 69.5\%). Myco-Sin showed good results to prevent
   infection after artificial hail simulation. Antinfek showed high
   efficacy (90\%) in preventing bloom blight, but could be tested only
   once so further research is needed to confirm this result. The design of
   the presented study enabled an extensive evaluation of the potential
   control agents and the aggregation and comparison of results and can be
   advised for other evaluations.}},

Title = {{Utilization of an Intraoperative Grading Scale in Laparoscopic
   Cholecystectomy: A Nepalese Perspective}},
Journal = {{GASTROENTEROLOGY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{Introduction. Difficult geographic diversity and late presentation to
   medical attention often make the laparoscopic cholecystectomy difficult
   and chances of conversion and complication remains. Various preoperative
   grading scales have been developed for predicting the difficulty of
   surgery in cholecystitis patients; however, intraoperative assessment of
   anatomical status and inflammation of the gall bladder has not been
   assessed till date except for some guidelines like the Parkland grading
   scale (PGS). We aimed to utilise this guideline in patients undergoing
   laparoscopic cholecystectomy in rural community of the developing
   nation. Methods. PGS was applied for all the patients undergoing
   laparoscopic cholecystectomy and laboratory and outcome factors like
   preoperative white blood cells (WBC), open conversion, subtotal
   cholecystectomy, length of surgery, and bile leaks postoperatively were
   assessed. Results. Among 178 patients who underwent cholecystectomy,
   there were 40 grade one GBs, 90 grade two GBs, 26 grade three GBs, 16
   grade four GBs, and six grade five GBs. With a conversion rate of
   6.74\%, eight patients underwent subtotal cholecystectomy. Among them,
   four patients were graded as 5th grade, two as 4th grade, and two as 3rd
   grade according to PGS system. Postoperative bile leak was seen in three
   patients among which two were grade five GBs and one was grade four.
   Preoperative WBC, conversion to open, subtotal cholecystectomy, length
   of surgery, and postoperative bile leak all significantly increased with
   increasing grades (p<0.05). Conclusion. PGS can be applied in patients
   undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the rural setting of a
   developing nation. With its application, postoperative course could be
   predicted and adequate counselling can be done about the possibilities
   of the outcome.}},

Abstract = {{The kinetics of the reactions of F atoms with hydrogen and deuterium has
   been studied in a discharge flow reactor combined with an electron
   impact ionization quadrupole mass spectrometer at nearly 2 Torr total

   constant of the reaction F + H-2 -> HF + H (1) was determined using both
   relative rate method (using reaction F + Br-2 as a reference) and
   absolute measurements, monitoring the kinetics of F atom consumption in
   excess of H-2: k(1) = (1.24 +/- 0.09) x 10(-10) exp(-(507 +/- 23)/T)
   cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1). The rate constant of the reaction F + D-2 ->
   DF + D (2) was measured under pseudo-first-order conditions in excess of
   D-2 over F atoms: k(2) = (8.47 +/- 0.42) x 10(-11) exp(-(670 +/- 16)/T)
   cm(3) molecule(-1) s(-1) (the uncertainties on both k(1) and k(2)
   represent precision at the 2 sigma level, the estimated total

Abstract = {{Exosomes (Exos) have been reported to promote pre-metastatic niche
   formation, proliferation, angiogenesis and metastasis. We have
   investigated the role of uPAR in melanoma cell lines-derived Exos and
   their pro-angiogenic effects on human microvascular endothelial cells
   (HMVECs) and endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs). Melanoma Exos
   were isolated from conditioned media of A375 and M6 cells by
   differential centrifugation and filtration. Tunable Resistive Pulse
   Sensing (TRPS) and Nanoparticle tracking analysis were performed to
   analyze dimension and concentration of Exos. The CRISPR-Cas 9 technology
   was exploited to obtain a robust uPAR knockout. uPAR is expressed in
   melanoma Exos that are internalized by HMVECs and ECFCs, enhancing
   VE-Cadherin, EGFR and uPAR expression in endothelial cells that undergo
   a complete angiogenic program, including proliferation, migration and
   tube formation. uPAR loss reduced the pro-angiogenic effects of melanoma
   Exos in vitro and in vivo by inhibition of VE-Cadherin, EGFR and uPAR
   expression and of ERK1,2 signaling in endothelial cells. A similar
   effect was obtained with a peptide that inhibits uPAR-EGFR interaction
   and with the EGFR inhibitor Gefitinib, which also inhibited melanoma
   Exos-dependent EGFR phosphorylation. This study suggests that uPAR is
   required for the pro-angiogenic activity of melanoma Exos. We propose
   the identification of uPAR-expressing Exos as a potentially useful
   biomarker for assessing pro-angiogenic propensity and eventually
   monitoring the response to treatment in metastatic melanoma patients.}},

Abstract = {{The market segmentation among local governments under decentralization
   of China not only directly triggered the ``fragmentation{''} of regional
   development, but also hindered collaborative actions in environmental
   governance. This study adopts a new method to calculate regional
   environmental collaborative governance using a synergy degree model of a
   complex system, and then it empirically analyzes the impact of Chinese
   market segmentation. We find that the regional environmental
   collaborative governance in China shows a growing trend during the
   period of investigation, but the level is still low. Market segmentation
   has significantly inhibited the regional collaborative governance of
   environmental pollution among local governments of China. The effect of
   market segmentation on the order of personnel input and capital input is
   significantly negative, while the effect on the order of policy input
   and organizational input is not significant. In the areas where the air
   pollution and water pollution are serious, the effect of market
   segmentation is also significantly negative. The conclusions are helpful
   to understanding the institutional factors that hinder regional
   environmental collaborative governance in China more comprehensively,
   and provide insights for improving the performance of environmental
   governance.}},

Title = {{Young Patients With Persistent and Complex Care Needs Require an
   Integrated Care Approach: Baseline Findings From the Multicenter Youth
   Flexible ACT Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: The Multicenter Youth Flexible ACT Study is an ongoing
   observational prospective cohort study that examines the effects of
   Youth Flexible ACT (Assertive Community Treatment) on young people with
   complex care needs who are difficult to engage in traditional
   (office-based) mental health services. However, a clear and detailed
   description of this patient group is lacking. In the current paper, we
   present baseline characteristics and psychosocial outcomes of the Youth
   Flexible ACT target group and explore the existence of underlying
   specific patient subgroups.
   Methods: Sixteen Youth Flexible ACT teams from seven mental healthcare
   institutes in the Netherlands participated in the study. Research
   participants were monitored for 18 months and administered
   questionnaires measuring psychiatric- and social functioning every 6
   months, yielding four measurements. Baseline data were obtained from 199
   adolescents, their mental health workers, and parents/carers. Latent
   Class Analysis based on HoNOSCA scores (measuring psychosocial and daily
   functioning) was conducted to identify underlying subgroups.
   Results: The target group of Youth Flexible ACT mainly consisted of
   patients older than 15 years of age with a history of (specialized)
   mental healthcare. They face many complex problems, including trauma;
   developmental, mood, and anxiety disorders; and problems with school
   attendance, family life, and peer relationships. Other frequently
   reported difficulties were substance misuse, the involvement of the
   legal system or police, problems with intellectual functioning, and
   personal finance. Patients were classified into four distinct classes:
   the ``internalizing,{''} ``externalizing,{''} ``non-specific,{''} and
   the ``overly impulsive{''} subgroup. Each subgroup had its unique
   pattern of difficulties and focus, respectively, high levels of
   depression and anxiety, disruptive behavior, unspecific difficulties,
   and substance misuse.
   Conclusions: As expected, patients in Youth Flexible ACT experienced
   many severe problems, rendering them vulnerable to fragmented and, thus,
   ineffective care. Our findings underscore the need for an integrated
   care approach with a multidisciplinary team of skilled professionals
   that can bridge these wide-ranging psychosocial problems, as each class
   of participants experienced a different set of difficulties. Youth
   Flexible ACT teams need to adjust their care services accordingly.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reconstructs the political thought of the Scottish legal
   philosopher, and eventually MEP, Sir Neil MacCormick (1941-2009), the
   founder of ``constitutional pluralism,{''} one of the most influential
   legal theories of the European union today. It argues that his legal
   theory is underpinned by a coherent and original political theory of
   post-sovereignty. But, contrary to many current interpretations, this
   article argues that normatively, constitutional pluralism is not a
   purely liberal theory. Neither is it inherently illiberal, as has been
   contended. Instead, this article spells out the hybrid institutional
   design imagined by N. MacCormick and inspired by the thought of D. Hume,
   as well as the lineaments of an ethical theory of post-sovereignty he
   developed. So doing, while I will argue that it ultimately leads to a
   kind of republican cosmopolitanism, the political theory of
   constitutional pluralism is shown to open up an important, if not fully
   developed, avenue to escape some shortcoming commonly associated with
   post-sovereignty.}},

Abstract = {{Conjunctivitis is one of the most common eye-related health problems and
   significantly influences patients' quality of life. Whether air
   pollution increased the risks of conjunctivitis is still unclear. Daily
   counts of outpatient visits for conjunctivitis, air pollution, and
   meteorological data during January 1, 2015-December 31, 2019 were
   collected from Tai'an, China. Generalized additive model with Poisson
   distribution was used to estimate the relationship between air pollution
   and visits for conjunctivitis, after controlling for the long-term and
   seasonal trends, weather variables, and day of the week. The effect of
   air pollution on visits for conjunctivitis was generally acute and
   significant at the current day and disappeared after 2 days. The
   relative risk of conjunctivitis visits associated with per 10 mu g/m(3)
   increases in PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and NO2 at lag 0-2 days was 1.006 (95\%
   CI: 1.001-1.011), 1.003 (95\% CI: 1.000-1.0107), 1.023 (95\% CI:
   1.009-1.037), and 1.025 (95\% CI: 1.010-1.040), respectively. The impact
   of air pollution on visits for conjunctivitis varied greatly by
   individual characteristics. The impact of NO2 was higher in males than
   in females, with the opposite trend for SO2 and PM2.5. Effect estimates
   of air pollutants were higher among return visits for conjunctivitis,
   the elderly, and white-collar workers. Our study highlights that the
   vulnerable subpopulations should pay more attention to protect
   themselves from air pollution.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MATERIALS}},

Abstract = {{Prediffused Fe-W powder with 2 wt\% of tungsten was prepared by heating
   Fe-W powder mixes at 800 degrees C for 45 min in H-2 atmosphere. Two
   kinds of Fe-2Cu-0.8C-0.6Mo-2W powder mixtures were obtained by
   mechanically mixing the prediffused Fe-W powders with the other
   elemental powders. After pressing and sintering, the sintered
   Fe-2Cu-0.8C-0.6Mo-2W materials were obtained from the two powder
   mixtures. The effects of the introducing methods of tungsten element and
   sintering conditions on microstructure, mechanical and wear properties
   of the sintered samples were investigated. The results show that with
   the increase of sintering temperature and time, hardness and strength of
   sintered samples increase. Prediffused treatment of Fe-W powder can
   improve density of green compacts and sintered samples. When W element
   introduced in the form of prediffused Fe-W powders, the compacts pressed
   at 700 MPa have a green density of 7.13 g/cm(3), and after sintered at
   1,150 degrees C, the density, hardness, tensile strength and radial
   crushing strength of the sintered samples are 7.16 g/cm(3), 95 HRB, 547
   and 791 MPa, respectively, which are higher than those of the samples
   prepared from powder mixtures by mechanically mixing the elemental
   powders. Furthermore, the prediffused treatment of Fe-W powders can
   improve the distribution of W element and enhance wear resistance.}},

Title = {{On the structure of streamwise wall-shear stress fluctuations in
   turbulent channel flows}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{903}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{A growing body of studies in wall-bounded turbulence has shown that the
   generation of wall-shear stress fluctuations is directly connected with
   outer-layer large-scale motions. In the present study, we investigate
   the scale-based structures of the streamwise wall-shear stress
   fluctuations (tau'(x)) in turbulent channel flows at different Reynolds
   numbers. The wall-shear stress structures are identified using a
   two-dimensional clustering methodology, and two indispensable factors,
   scale and sign, are considered for the analysis. The structures are
   classified into positive and negative families according to the sign of
   tau'(x). The statistical properties of the structures, including
   geometrical characteristics, spatial distribution, population density,
   fluctuating intensity, and correlations with outer motions are
   comprehensively investigated. Particular attention is paid to the
   asymmetries between positive and negative structures and their
   connection with wall-attached energy-containing eddies. In virtue of our
   results, only the large-scale structures of negative tau'(x) contain the
   footprints of the inactive part of wall-attached eddies populating the
   logarithmic region.}},

Title = {{Methamphetamine Activates Trace Amine Associated Receptor 1 to Regulate
   Astrocyte Excitatory Amino Acid Transporter-2 via Differential CREB
   Phosphorylation During HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{Methamphetamine (METH) use, referred to as methamphetamine use disorder
   (MUD), results in neurocognitive decline, a characteristic shared with
   HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). MUD exacerbates HAND
   partly through glutamate dysregulation. Astrocyte excitatory amino acid
   transporter (EAAT)-2 is responsible for >90\% of glutamate uptake from
   the synaptic environment and is significantly decreased with METH and
   HIV-1. Our previous work demonstrated astrocyte trace amine associated
   receptor (TAAR) 1 to be involved in EAAT-2 regulation. Astrocyte EAAT-2
   is regulated at the transcriptional level by cAMP responsive element
   binding (CREB) protein and NF-kappa B, transcription factors activated
   by cAMP, calcium and IL-1 beta. Second messengers, cAMP and calcium, are
   triggered by TAAR1 activation, which is upregulated by IL-1 beta
   METH-mediated increases in these second messengers and signal
   transduction pathways have not been shown to directly decrease astrocyte
   EAAT-2. We propose CREB activation serves as a master regulator of
   EAAT-2 transcription, downstream of METH-induced TAAR1 activation. To
   investigate the temporal order of events culminating in CREB activation,
   genetically encoded calcium indicators, GCaMP6s, were used to visualize
   METH-induced calcium signaling in primary human astrocytes. RNA
   interference and pharmacological inhibitors targeting or blocking
   cAMP-dependent protein kinase A and calcium/calmodulin kinase II
   confirmed METH-induced regulation of EAAT-2 and resultant glutamate
   clearance. Furthermore, we investigated METH-mediated CREB
   phosphorylation at both serine 133 and 142, the co-activator and
   co-repressor forms, respectively. Overall, this work revealed
   METH-induced differential CREB phosphorylation is a critical regulator
   for EAAT-2 function and may thus serve as a mechanistic target for the
   attenuation of METH-induced excitotoxicity in the context of HAND.}},

Title = {{Reframing Habermas's colonization thesis: Neoliberalism as
   relinguistification}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL THEORY}},
Abstract = {{While the critique of neoliberalism, as the form of contemporary
   capitalism, has been advanced from Marxian and Foucauldian perspectives,
   it has had limited attention from the perspective of Critical Theory.
   Largely unrecognized is the suitability of the theory of reification for
   this critique, specifically, Habermas's version. This article
   reconsiders Habermas's colonization thesis as the basis for a critical
   theory of neoliberalism, refining its theoretical framework to deepen
   its critical diagnosis. Against the dismissal of the system-lifeworld
   concept, a novel critique is advanced to suggest its original
   elaboration fell confusedly between two versions of social systems
   theory. Drawing from late developments, the scheme is reinterpreted as
   distinguishing two forms of communication in capitalist society:
   delinguistified and linguistic. This opens the way to reframe and
   communicatively transform colonization as relinguistification; that is,
   the translation of monetary coding into ordinary language such that
   communicative action is distorted from within by reifying concepts.}},

   cells in human bone marrow and spleen under physiological conditions.
   Transcriptomic profiles of bone marrow NK cells from patients with acute

Title = {{Synthesis and catalytic performance of zeolite-Y supported on silicon
   carbide in n-heptane cracking}},
Journal = {{APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{608}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we demonstrate a facile approach for the synthesis of
   zeolite-Y crystals (size, ca. -400 nm) supported on silicon carbide
   (SiC) with the assistance of the cationic template
   (polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride, PDDA). The polymeric cationic
   template used to treat SiC particles induces a positive charge on SiC
   surface which electro-statically attracts negatively charged
   aluminosilicate seeds and promotes the growth of zeolite (ZY) particles
   over SiC, thus leading to the formation of stable ZY@SiC supported
   catalysts. The supported ZY catalysts with different weight ratio of ZY
   and SiC were synthesized and characterized by various techniques such as
   XRD, SEM, SEM-EDX, SEMmapping, TEM, STEM, FT-IR, Al-27 MAS NMR and N-2
   sorption. The characterization of the supported ZY catalysts suggests
   the uniform growth of ZY particles over SiC together with the creation
   of hierarchical micro-mesopores assembly. In the catalytic cracking of
   n-heptane, the catalyst ZY@SiC-50 displayed a remarkable improvement in
   reaction rate when compared to commercial zeolite-Y (CBV-600) amounting
   to 3.5 folds enhancement. Interestingly, the light olefins yield is also
   substantially improved. At WHSV of 8 h(-1) and 475 degrees C, the
   highest light olefin yield (24-36 \%) was achieved over ZY@SiC-50
   whereas the reference catalyst, CBV-600 produced lower light olefins
   yield (7-17 \%). Moreover, the supported ZY catalyst exhibited less
   deactivation rates. This improved performance is attributed to the
   hierarchical micro-mesopores assembly created by the homogeneous
   dispersion of zeolite crystals on SiC which offers fast diffusion
   pathways for the reactants and enhanced accessibility to active sites
   thus leading to higher observed reaction rates and fast diffusion of
   products thus minimizing the occurrence of side reactions.}},

Abstract = {{An intranasal formulation of esketamine, the S enantiomer of ketamine,
   in conjunction with an oral antidepressant, has been approved by the FDA
   for treating treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (TRD) in
   2019, almost 50 years after it was approved as an intravenous
   anesthetic. In contrast to traditional antidepressants, ketamine shows a
   rapid (within 2 h) and sustained (similar to 7 days) antidepressant
   effect and has significant positive effects on antisuicidal ideation.
   Ketamine's antidepressant mechanism is predominantly mediated by the
   N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) receptor, although NMDA-independent
   mechanisms are not ruled out. At the neurocircuitry level, ketamine
   affects the brain's reward and mood circuitry located in the
   corticomesolimbic structures involving the hippocampus, nucleus
   accumbens, and prefrontal cortex. Repurposing of ketamine for treating
   TRD provided a new understanding of the pathophysiology of depression, a
   paradigm shift from monoamine to glutamatergic neurotransmission, thus
   making it a unique tool to investigate the brain and its complex
   neurocircuitries.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of humeri from fossils that span the fin-to-limb transition
   reveal that the change in the humerus shape is driven by both ecology
   and phylogeny, and is associated with functional trade-offs related to
   locomotor performance.
   The acquisition of terrestrial, limb-based locomotion during tetrapod
   evolution has remained a subject of debate for more than a century(1,2).
   Our current understanding of the locomotor transition from water to land
   is largely based on a few exemplar fossils such as Tiktaalik(3),
   Acanthostega(4), Ichthyostega(5) and Pederpes(6). However, isolated bony
   elements may reveal hidden functional diversity, providing a more
   comprehensive evolutionary perspective(7). Here we analyse 40
   three-dimensionally preserved humeri from extinct tetrapodomorphs that
   span the fin-to-limb transition and use functionally informed ecological
   adaptive landscapes(8-10) to reconstruct the evolution of terrestrial
   locomotion. We show that evolutionary changes in the shape of the
   humerus are driven by ecology and phylogeny and are associated with
   functional trade-offs related to locomotor performance. Two divergent
   adaptive landscapes are recovered for aquatic fishes and terrestrial
   crown tetrapods, each of which is defined by a different combination of
   functional specializations. Humeri of stem tetrapods share a unique
   suite of functional adaptations, but do not conform to their own
   predicted adaptive peak. Instead, humeri of stem tetrapods fall at the
   base of the crown tetrapod landscape, indicating that the capacity for
   terrestrial locomotion occurred with the origin of limbs. Our results
   suggest that stem tetrapods may have used transitional gaits(5,11)
   during the initial stages of land exploration, stabilized by the
   opposing selective pressures of their amphibious habits. Effective
   limb-based locomotion did not arise until loss of the ancestral
   `L-shaped' humerus in the crown group, setting the stage for the
   diversification of terrestrial tetrapods and the establishment of modern
   ecological niches(12,13).}},

Abstract = {{Transition-metal selenides have attracted extensive concern as one of
   the alternatives for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) anodes due to their
   high theoretical capacities, good cycling stability and environmental
   benignity. However, the application of metal selenides is restricted by
   severe volume variation and sluggish kinetics during cyclings, which
   cause capacity fading induced by the pulverization and aggregation of
   the electrode materials. Herein, the FeSe2@C microspheres assembled with
   FeSe2 nano-particles cotaed by carbon layers are fabricated using a
   hydrothermal method and the subsequent annealing treatment. When served
   as anodes for SIBs, the FeSe2@C electrodes exhibit excellent
   electrochemical performances. A high reversible capacity of 461 mA h
   g(-1) is retained after 100 cycles at 50 mA g(-1). Even at high rate of
   1000 mA g(-1), a long-term cycling capacity of 428 mA h g(-1) is
   achieved after 1000 cycles. The kinetic analyses confirm that the
   superior sodium storage performances of FeSe2@C composites are mainly
   attributed to the pseudocapacitive contribution facilitated by the
   unique nano-micro hierarchical structure. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Developing friendly relations among nations founded on the `principle of
   equal rights and self-determination of peoples' and `sovereign equality
   of all its Members' and encouraging `respect for human rights and
   fundamental freedoms' are two purposes of the United Nations. Human
   rights are often understood to be `universal, indivisible and
   interdependent and interrelated', but with hundreds of different peoples
   in the world how can that be? Democracy is another `universally
   recognised ideal' and `core value' usually understood to mean that a
   sovereign people through a democratic-majority-rule system of governance
   decide the rules of law by which they live. Are these concepts
   reconcilable? The tension between human rights and democracy is not
   isolated to Europe where states in the ECtHR system often object to
   human rights decisions by the court. A meta-narrative of
   constitutionalisation and judicialisation is offered to explain a
   complex global political context of human rights jurisprudence. How the
   ECtHR, a leading human right court, addresses this tension may be an
   important lesson for the global human rights movement; the court's use
   of evolutionary dynamic interpretation and the margin of appreciation
   reflect these tensions. Will the court accept the invitation to be more
   respectful of democratic sovereignty or exercise increasingly strong
   judicial review such that contracting parties withdraw from the system?
   This is not only an important question for the success of the ECtHR but
   the wrong response could portend a dim future for the global human
   rights movement.}},

Abstract = {{The magnetocrystalline anisotropy of GdRh(2)Si(2)is examined in detail
   via the electron spin resonance (ESR) of its well-localised
   Gd(3+)moments. BelowT(N)= 107 K, long range magnetic order sets in with
   ferromagnetic layers in the (aa)-plane stacked antiferromagnetically
   along thec-axis of the tetragonal structure. Interestingly, the
   easy-plane anisotropy allows for the observation of antiferromagnetic
   resonance at X- and Q-band microwave frequencies. In addition to the
   easy-plane anisotropy we have also quantified the weaker fourfold
   anisotropy within the easy plane. The obtained resonance fields are
   modelled in terms of eigenoscillations of the two antiferromagnetically
   coupled sublattices. Conversely, this model provides plots of the
   eigenfrequencies as a function of field and the specific anisotropy
   constants. Such calculations have rarely been done. Therefore our
   analysis is prototypical for other systems with fourfold in-plane
   anisotropy. It is demonstrated that the experimental in-plane ESR data
   may be crucial for a precise knowledge of the out-of-plane anisotropy.}},

   to the surface interaction between Ag/SiO2 and SrWO4 that activate H2O2
   surface molecules in absence of light. The photocatalytic enhancement
   was interpreted by the hot electrons ejected from Ag NPs to the SrWO4
   rather than the p-n junction created by Ag/SiO2 and SrWO4 mechanism.
   Different spectroscopic techniques such as SEM, TEM, XRD were used for
   the catalysts characterizations. The optical measurements such as UV-Vis
   and photoluminescence were incorporated to further support the
   mechanism. The catalyst posses high catalytic activity over wide pH
   range (4-10). (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this study is to explore how Swedish police
   officers describe occupational knowledge. By learning more about how
   officers describe occupational knowledge, the study gives more insight
   about the types of information that they may be more likely to adopt in
   their occupational tasks. Design/methodology/approach In this study, the
   author conducted 27 semi-structured interviews with Swedish police
   officers. I asked officers several open-ended questions about their
   everyday work life and professional experience. Findings Swedish
   officers divide knowledge into two categories, which are theoretical
   knowledge and practical knowledge. Theoretical knowledge is learned in
   the academy and is described as ``black and white,{''} meaning that it
   is considered static and not applicable to what happens out in patrol.
   Practical knowledge is learned in the field from colleagues. Research
   limitations/implications Police officers around the world have a wide
   range of requirements and training to become police officers. However,
   empirical studies have found that officers tend to use different types
   of information when performing policing tasks. Depending on how
   information is perceived and is taught, officers may respond differently
   to different types of knowledge, due to their evaluation of the validity
   of the knowledge. Originality/value The findings in this study support
   previous empirical studies on the area of policing and knowledge in two
   ways; first, this study argues that there is a categorization of
   knowledge among police officers. Second, this study suggests that
   officers view one occupational knowledge type as more theoretical and
   one as more practical.}},

Title = {{Conceptualizing environmental effects of carsharing services: A system

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{745}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{Emerging carsharing services and their interconnections with other modes
   of urban transport, regulations, car manufacturing and population have
   affected the dynamics of energy consumption, environmental pollution and
   greenhouse gas emission within a complex system. However, although some
   aspects of environmental impacts of transport sector have been
   investigated in the literature, well-deserved studies on the
   environmental effects of carsharing services following a system thinking
   approach is missing. This research aims at providing a comprehensive
   conceptual framework to systematize the interconnections between
   carsharing services and their environmental effects. To do this, system
   dynamics (SD) modeling, as a tool to simulate complex and dynamic
   systems, is applied and the proposed framework model is illustrated by
   using a causal-loop diagram (CLD). Along with analyzing the main
   identified causal loops within the presented CLD, relevant strategies
   are proposed to reduce the negative environmental effects associated
   with the carsharing services, considering the whole lifecycle of a
   shared vehicle. The proposed framework can help environment policy
   makers and shared mobility practitioners in long-term strategic
   decision-making. Moreover, it can be applied by the researchers as a
   basis for future research, not only for SD modeling but also other
   simulation and analysis structures. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Background Breakages of the cold chain of botulinum neurotoxin A
   (BONT-A) preparations is not a rare event and occurs due to several
   unexpected and unintentional reasons during daily practice and
   intervention schedules could not be proposed due to the lack of data.
   Objective To investigate the heat stability of abobotulinum toxin A
   (AboBONT-A) in terms of efficacy and duration of action upon storage at
   room temperature (25 degrees C) for 2, 4, and 8 weeks.
   Methods and Materials Twenty rabbits were divided into four groups and
   received an injection of ideally stored AboBONT-A (Group 1) and stored
   AboBONT-A for 2 (Group 2), 4 (Group 3), and 8 weeks (Group 4) at room
   temperature into the anterior auricular muscle. All rabbits were
   followed up and photographed by weekly for 16 weeks. Grade of paralysis
   was evaluated by using a modified visual scoring system.
   Results No significant alteration was found in initial potency of stored
   AboBONT-A at room temperature for up to 4 weeks. Storage at room
   temperature for 2 weeks did not affect the duration of action (group 2;
   P = .69), and faster recovery was observed in group 3 and group 4.
   Conclusion The bioactivity of AboBONT-A is not altered till 2 weeks upon
   storage at room temperature.}},

Journal = {{NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we theorise global financing partnerships as a `space
   between fields' that is generated and structured by the relationships
   between the actors mobilised into partnership boards from different
   fields. We investigate the structuring of the space of partnerships
   through a formal network analysis of a new dataset of 188 board members
   of 10 global financing partnerships across climate change, education,
   health and nutrition. Individual board members are analysed with
   reference to their home organisation and sector, the boards on which
   they serve, and salient issue areas. Centrality and ERGM analyses reveal
   that, in contrast to the policy narrative of inclusive and egalitarian
   partnering, donors (from states, international organisations and private
   sector) are systematically privileged in the structuring of this
   partnership space. We identify network mechanisms through which
   systematic biases in partnership relations perpetuate existing
   hierarchies, and introduce the concept of `relational practices' that
   could counter these mechanisms. Combining a theorisation of partnerships
   as spaces between fields with network concepts provides a distinct
   theoretical basis for elucidating the structuring of partnership spaces
   at the macro-level, through the analysis of individuals' connections at
   the micro-level and inter-organisational ties at the meso-level.}},

   With Special Reference to Charitable Organizations}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{The accurate delineation of various forms of business organization
   requires a comparative analysis of their objectives, functions, and
   organizational structures. In particular, this paper highlights
   differences in managerial work between business firms and non-profits
   exemplified by the charitable organization. It adopts as its template
   the theory of the marketing firm, a depiction of the modern corporation
   as it responds to the imperatives of customer-oriented management,
   namely consumer discretion and consumer sophistication. It describes in
   2 the essentials of the theory and its basis in consumer behavior
   analysis, and outlines its unique position as the organization
   responsible for marketing transactions, based on objective exchange,
   competitive markets and prices, and the deployment of the entire
   marketing mix. 3 deals in greater depth with the objective, strategic
   functions, and organization of the marketing firm in terms of the
   concepts of metacontingency and bilateral contingency. 4 discusses how
   the marketing firm differs from charities in terms of goal separation,
   market-based pricing and competition, the entrepreneurial (strategic)
   process, the pursuit of customer-oriented management, and organizational
   structure. Particular attention is accorded the organizational
   differences between marketing firms and charities, which arise as a
   direct consequence of the distinct patterns of contingency they entail.
   5 discusses the implications of the foregoing analysis and draws
   appropriate conclusions.}},

   study aims to study the mid- and long-term survival outcome and
   associated prognostic factors following curative hepatectomy for HCC in
   a tertiary referral center. The clinical data of 325 patients who
   underwent curative hepatectomy for HCC were reviewed. They were
   stratified into 3 groups for comparison (Group 1, overall survival <5
   years; Group 2, overall survival >= 5, and <10 years; Group 3, overall
   survival >= 10 years). Favorable independent prognostic factors for mid-
   and long-term survival were analyzed. A bimodal distribution of actual
   survival outcome was observed, with short-term (<5 years) survival of
   52.7\% (n = 171), mid-term survival of 18.1\% (n = 59), and long-term
   survival of 29.2\% (n = 95). Absence of microvascular invasion (OR
   3.690, 95\% CI: 1.562-8.695) was independent good prognostic factor for
   mid-term survival. Regarding long-term overall survival, young age (OR
   1.050, 95\% CI: 0.920-0.986), ASA grade <= 2 (OR 3.746, 95\% CI:
   1.325-10.587), high albumin level (OR 1.008, 95\% CI: 0.920-0.986),

   independent good prognostic factors. Curative hepatectomy results in
   bimodal actual survival outcome with favorable long-term survival rate
   of 29.2\%. Favorable independent prognostic factors (age, ASA grade,
   albumin level, tumor number, and microvascular invasion) are identified

Title = {{An intergroup approach to collective narcissism: Intergroup threats and
   hostility in four European Union countries}},
Journal = {{GROUP PROCESSES \& INTERGROUP RELATIONS}},
Abstract = {{Although it is known that collective narcissism is associated with
   problematic intergroup relations, its predictors are less well
   understood. Two studies, conducted in four European Union countries
   (Germany, Greece, Portugal, the United Kingdom {[}UK]), tested the
   hypotheses that integrated (i.e., realistic and symbolic) threat (Study
   1, N = 936) as well as distinctiveness threat (Study 2, N = 434)
   positively predict national collective narcissism and national ingroup
   satisfaction, but that only national collective narcissism predicts
   problematic intergroup relations in reference to threatening outgroups.
   The results were consistent with those hypotheses. The two types of
   threat predicted increased national collective narcissism and national
   ingroup satisfaction. However, only national collective narcissism was
   associated with negative emotions and hostile behavioral intentions
   toward the threatening outgroups, when its overlap with national ingroup
   satisfaction was partialled out. These cross-national findings advanced
   knowledge of predictors, as well as consequences, of collective
   narcissism.}},

Abstract = {{The localized f-electrons enrich the magnetic properties in
   rare-earth-based intermetallics. Among those, compounds with heavier 4d
   and 5d transition metals are even more fascinating because anomalous
   electronic properties may be induced by the hybridization of 4f and
   itinerant conduction electrons primarily from the d orbitals. Here, we
   describe the observation of trivalent Yb3+ with S = 1/2 at low
   temperatures in YbxPt5P, the first of a new family of materials. YbxPt5P
   (0.23 <= x <= 0.96) phases were synthesized and structurally
   characterized. They exhibit a large homogeneity width with the Yb ratio
   exclusively occupying the la site in the anti-CeCoIn5 structure.
   Moreover, a sudden resistivity drop could be found in YbxPt5P below
   similar to 0.6 K, which requires further investigation. First-principles
   electronic structure calculations substantiate the antiferromagnetic
   ground state and indicate that two-dimensional nesting around the Fermi
   level may give rise to exotic physical properties, such as
   superconductivity. YbxPt5P appears to be a unique case among materials.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of saphenous vein
   grafts (SVGs) is associated with an increased risk of complications,
   particularly no-reflow phenomenon and distal embolization due to low
   patency rates. The CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score is a clinical risk
   stratification tool used to predict thromboembolism events especially in
   patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.
   AIMS The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between
   the CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score and no-reflow phenomenon after SVG PCI in
   patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes
   (NSTE-ACS).
   METHODS In this study, we included 268 patients diagnosed with NSTE-ACS
   who underwent PCI for SVG disease in our tertiary cardiovascular center.
   Patients were divided into 2 groups: group 1 without no-reflow
   phenomenon (n = 190) and group 2 with no-reflow phenomenon (n =
   78)following the intervention, and then compared based on
   CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc scores.
   RESULTS The CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score (P <0.001) was significantly higher
   in group 2, even though no significant difference regarding atrial
   fibrillation was observed between the study groups. The CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc
   score (P <0.001), degenerated saphenous vein graft (P = 0.006), and
   intraluminal thrombus (P <0.001) were found to be independent predictors
   of no-reflow phenomenon. Receiver operating characteristics analysis
   showed that a CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score of 4 predicted no-reflow phenomenon
   with 67.9\% sensitivity and 69.3\% specificity.
   CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that the CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score can be
   an independent predictor of no-reflow phenomenon in patients undergoing
   SVG interventions. As a simple and easy-to-calculate score, it might be
   a useful assessment tool to predict no-reflow phenomenon before SVG
   interventions in patients with NSTE-ACS.}},

Abstract = {{There are no records of established plant pathogenic Phytophthora
   species in Finnish forests, but they are likely in the future.
   Therefore, the effects of Phytophthora inoculations on young, ca.
   2-month-old silver birch (Betula pendula) seedling roots and shoots were
   investigated.
   Visual inspection of dark discoloration, direct PCR and re-isolation,
   and detailed root morphology analyses were used to evaluate the effects
   of Phytophthora inoculation on roots. Symptoms in leaves and stems were
   also recorded.
   Phytophthora was successfully re-isolated from 67\% of the
   surface-sterilized roots of inoculated seedlings, but not from the
   non-inoculated control seedlings. Dark discolorations were found more
   often in the root segments of inoculated seedlings than in control
   seedlings. In the Phytophthora-treated seedlings, discoloured root
   segments were usually linked and found primarily in the main root or
   lateral roots attached to it, whereas in the control seedlings a few
   single discoloured root segments were scattered throughout the root
   systems. The number of root segments was lower in the inoculated than in
   the control seedlings, indicating root loss after Phytophthora
   inoculation. In the shoots of inoculated birches, leaf and shoot wilting
   was observed.
   The appearance of wilting in shoots without visible dark discoloration
   in the base of stems indicated that symptoms originated from roots
   inoculated with Phytophthora.}},

Abstract = {{Casein gels consist of a fractal organized network of aggregated casein
   particles. The gel texture thereby depends on the structure, the spatial
   distribution, and the interaction forces of the network's elementary
   building blocks. The aim of this study was to explore the
   technofunctional consequences of a possible specificity of Maillard
   reaction-induced cross-linking reactions on casein with respect to
   texture and microstructure of acid gels. Therefore, sodium caseinate
   glycated with lactose in the dry state (60 degrees C, a(w) 0.5) was
   compared with casein samples cross-linked with methylglyoxal, with
   glutaraldehyde, or via microbial transglutaminase, respectively, at
   similar levels of protein cross-linking as confirmed by size-exclusion
   chromatography under denaturing conditions. Casein gels prepared by
   acidification with glucono-6-lactone were characterized concerning pH
   kinetics during gelation, mechanical texture properties under large
   deformation, and water-holding capacity, while viscometric properties of
   casein suspensions were obtained prior to gelation. The gel
   microstructure was captured by confocal laser scanning microscopy and
   evaluated by means of image texture analysis. All protein cross-linking
   reactions studied led to an enhanced gel strength which was accompanied
   by an increased interconnectivity of the gel network and a decrease in
   apparent pore sizes. Gels with more densely packed strands, as was the
   case for enzymatically modified casein, exhibited pronounced mechanical
   stability. The spontaneous destabilization of the gel network upon
   prolonged glycation reactions, which was not obviously displayed by
   microstructural features but connected to an increased viscosity and
   pronounced pseudoplastic flow of the unacidified suspension, suggests a
   limitation of particle rearrangements and the weakening of interparticle
   protein-protein interactions by additional structure attributes formed
   during the early Maillard reaction (glycoconjugation).}},

Abstract = {{Background Brief measures of physical function such as gait speed may be
   useful to optimize treatment intensity for older adults who have blood
   cancer; however, little is known about whether such assessments are
   already captured within oncologists' ``gestalt{''} assessments.
   Methods Gait speed was assessed in 782 patients >= 75 years of age who
   had blood cancer, with results reported to providers after treatment
   decisions were made; 408 patients required treatment when different
   intensities were available per National Comprehensive Cancer Network
   (NCCN) guidelines. We performed structured abstractions of treatment
   intensity recommendations into standard intensity, reduced intensity, or
   supportive care, based on NCCN guidelines. We modeled gait speed and
   survival using Cox regression and performed ordinal logistic regression
   to assess predictors of NCCN-based categorizations of oncologists'
   treatment intensity recommendations, including gait speed.
   Results The median survival by gait speed category was 10.8 months (<0.4
   m/s), 18.6 months (0.4-0.6 m/s), 34.0 months (0.6-0.8 m/s), and
   unreached (>0.8 m/s). Univariable hazard ratios (HRs) for death
   increased for each lower category compared with >= 0.8 m/s (0.6-0.8 m/s:
   HR, 1.76; 0.4-0.6 m/s: HR, 2.30; <0.4 m/s: HR, 3.31). Gait speed
   predicted survival in multivariable Cox regression (all P < .05). In
   multivariable models including age, sex, and Eastern Cooperative
   Oncology Group performance status, gait speed did not predict
   oncologists' recommended treatment intensity (all P > .05) and did not
   add to a base model predicting recommended treatment intensity.
   Conclusion In older adults with blood cancer who presented for
   treatment, gait speed predicted survival but not treatment intensity
   recommendation. Incorporating gait speed into decision making may
   improve optimal treatment selection.}},

Abstract = {{Children and adolescents who have experienced traumatic events
   demonstrate a variety of posttraumatic symptoms, including recurrent
   nightmares, as well as adverse reactions in the school setting. The
   current study examined nightmare symptoms, posttraumatic stress, sleep
   disturbance, and self- and teacher-reported school functioning of 64
   youths in the Gaza Strip, ages 12 to 16, who have lived through three
   wars and experience ongoing conflict and political insecurity. Students
   were treatment-seeking for sleep-problems and reported, on average, five
   nightmares per week for an average of three years, with concomitant
   disrupted sleep, fear of going to sleep, and not feeling rested in the
   morning. Both teachers and students reported that participants exhibited
   impaired academic functioning and daytime sleepiness. The content of the
   students' nightmares demonstrated frightening themes of being under
   attack and loss of self-efficacy/control; threat levels were high, and
   almost 60\% included the threat of death. Approximately half of the
   nightmares included surreal elements in addition to more realistic
   scenes of violence. Participants in the study demonstrated substantial
   posttraumatic sleep problems with intensely distressing, frequent and
   chronic nightmares, andnightmare symptoms were associated with
   impairment in school functioning. Given the disruptive and distressing
   nature of these students' nightmare disturbance, we suggest that
   increasing self-efficacy in relation to the experience of recurrent
   nightmares may be a good point of intervention with these recurrently
   traumatized youth. Thus, increasing the understanding of students'
   nightmare symptoms may lead to ameliorating the suffering of youths in
   war zones and may have positive effects on their school functioning.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Localization of the vagus nerve is required during
   intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) for thyroid surgery in order to
   electromyographically verify the functional integrity of inferior
   laryngeal nerve and aim to reduce the risk of postoperative vocal fold
   paralysis. Classically, the vagus nerve courses within the carotid
   sheath between the common carotid artery and internal jugular vein, but
   anatomic variations have been described. Our aim was to compare
   preoperative ultrasound (US) and intraoperative localization of vagus
   nerve and to document anatomic variations. Patients and methods
   Retrospective study of patients undergoing thyroidectomy. The vagus
   nerve was identified 2 cm below the inferior border of the cricoid
   cartilage, on US performed 6 weeks prior to surgery; then, vagus nerve
   was identified surgically. Results For 82 patients, on preoperative US,
   the right vagus nerve was in between, superficial, or deep to the
   vessels in 94\%, 2.4\%, and 3.6\%, and on the left in 72\%, 24.4\%, and
   3.6\%. Intraoperatively, the right vagus was in between, superficial, or
   deep in 90\%, 4\%, and 6\%, and on the left in 67\%, 27\%, and 6\%. US
   correlated with surgery on the right in 79/82 (96\%) and on the left in
   78/82 (95\%). Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first study
   directly comparing US and intraoperative findings. The US and surgical
   findings were identical in 95\% on the left and 96\% on the right The
   vagus nerve was superficial in 27\% of cases on the left and 4\% on the
   right. Identifying this anatomic variation preoperatively may facilitate
   IONM.}},

Title = {{Nanobody click chemistry for convenient site-specific fluorescent
   labelling, single step immunocytochemistry and delivery into living

Journal = {{NEW BIOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{59}},

Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{While conventional antibodies have been an instrument of choice in
   immunocytochemistry for some time, their small counterparts known as
   nanobodies have been much less frequently used for this purpose. In this
   study we took advantage of the availability of nanobody cDNAs to
   site-specifically introduce a non-standard amino acid carrying an
   azide/alkyne moiety, allowing subsequent Cu(I)-catalyzed Azide-Alkyne
   Click Chemistry (CuAAC). This generated a fluorescently labelled
   nanobody that can be used in single step immunocytochemistry as compared
   to conventional two step immunocytochemistry. Two strategies were
   explored to label nanobodies with Alexa Fluor 488. The first involved
   enzymatic addition of an alkyne-containing peptide to nanobodies using
   sortase A, while the second consisted of incorporating para-azido
   phenylalanine at the nanobody C-terminus. Through these approaches, the
   fluorophore was covalently and site-specifically attached. It was
   demonstrated that cortactin and beta-catenin, cytoskeletal and adherens
   junction proteins respectively, can be imaged in cells in this manner
   through single step immunocytochemistry. However, fixation and
   permeabilization of cells can alter native protein structure and form a
   dense cross-linked protein network, encumbering antibody binding. It was
   shown that photoporation prior to fixation not only allowed delivery of
   nanobodies into living cells, but also facilitated j3-catenin nanobody
   Nb86 imaging of its target, which was not possible in fixed cells.
   Pharmacological inhibitors are lacking for many non-enzymatic proteins,
   and it is therefore expected that new biological information will be
   obtained through photoporation of fluorescent nanobodies, which allows
   the study of short term effects, independent of gene-dependent
   (intrabody) expression.}},

Abstract = {{Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is released from cancer cells and
   oncogenic mutations in ctDNA can be measured from plasma samples.
   Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) is a sensitive and specific method for the
   detection of mutations in ctDNA. We analyzed serial plasma samples (n =
   80) from ten metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients with a known
   KRAS mutation in their primary tumor. The patients were undergoing
   oncological treatment with bevacizumab in combination with alternating
   capecitabine and oxaliplatin or irinotecan. Baseline ddPCR KRAS mutation
   allele frequency (MAF) values ranged from 0\% to 63\%. The first
   radiologic response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST)
   evaluation was performed 45-63 days after the initiation of treatment,
   and by this time three patients had an undetectable level of KRAS
   mutation, one had a MAF value of 0.5\%, and one had a MAF value of 3\%
   that had been reduced by 95\% from the baseline value. In three of these
   patients the RECIST assessment was stable disease and in two partial
   response. In seven patients, ddPCR MAF values increased before
   radiological disease progression or death, while one patient remained
   disease-free with an undetectable KRAS mutation level. Next, we analyzed
   all available plasma samples with the Idylla ctKRAS system (n = 60), and
   found that the overall degree of agreement between ddPCR and Idylla was
   almost perfect (kappa value = 0.860). We used next-generation sequencing
   (NGS) to detect treatment-induced mutations in the last serial plasma
   sample of each patient, but were unable to find any new mutations when
   compared to the primary tumor. This study shows that ddPCR and Idylla
   are equally efficient for the detection of KRAS mutations in the liquid
   biopsies from mCRC patients and that ctDNA may indicate the
   disappearance of treatment responsive KRAS positive mCRC clones and
   serve as an early sign of disease progression.}},

Abstract = {{We study the variation of tropospheric NO2 vertical column densities
   (TropNO(2)VCDs) over East China during the 2005-2020 lunar new year
   (LNY) holiday seasons to understand factors on the reduction of
   tropospheric NO2 during the outbreak of COVID-19 in East China using
   Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMl) and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument
   (TROPOMI) observations. TropNO(2)VCDs from OMI and TROPOMI reveal sharp
   reductions of 33\%-72\% during 2020 LNY holiday season and the
   co-occurring outbreak of COVID-19 relative to the climatological mean of
   2005-2019 LNY holiday seasons, and 22\%-67\% reduction relative to the
   2019 LNY holiday season. These reductions of TropNO(2)VCD occur majorly
   over highly polluted metropolitan areas with condensed industrial and
   transportation emission sources. COVID-19 control measures including
   lockdowns and shelter-in-place regulations are the primary reason for
   these tropospheric NO2 reductions over most areas of East China in 2020
   LNY holiday season relative to the 2019 LNY holiday season, as COVID-19
   control measures may explain similar to 87\%-90\% of tropospheric NO2
   reduction in Wuhan as well as similar to 62\%-89\% in Beijing, Yangtze
   River Delta (YRD) and Sichuan Basin areas. The clean air regulation of
   China also contributes significantly to reductions of tropospheric NO2
   simultaneously and is the primary factor in the Pearl River Delta (PRD)
   area, by explaining similar to 56\%-63\% of the tropospheric NO2
   reduction there. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   characteriazed by its mild reaction conditions and broad substrate
   scope, which converted a diverse array of amine-containing molecules to
   the alkyl-CF2COPh products. Moreover, the resulting products can be
   easily transformed into a vast array of structurally novel and
   interesting difluoro-containing moieties, therefore providing a facile
   route for applications in medicinal chemistry and the life sciences.}},

Abstract = {{The success of laser-foil-printing (LFP) additive manufacturing depends
   critically on the laser welding of sheet metals onto the substrate or
   the previous layer during the part fabrication process. The welding can
   be generally categorized into two modes: conduction mode and keyhole
   mode. In this study, 304L stainless steel parts fabricated by the LFP
   process using the two laser welding modes are compared. The porosity,
   microstructure, and tensile properties of the fabricated parts in these
   two modes are measured and compared in the laser scanning direction (X)
   and part building direction (Z). The parts fabricated in the conduction
   mode have a higher density than those fabricated in the keyhole mode. On
   the tensile properties, both yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile
   strength (UTS) have insignificant differences statistically based on the
   ANOVA analysis between the tensile specimens fabricated with the two
   welding modes by the LFP process. However, the conduction-mode parts
   have higher elongation than the keyhole-mode parts in both the X and Z
   directions, and the difference is especially significant in the Z
   direction. By using the electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD), it
   was found that the much higher ductility for the conduction-mode parts
   in the Z-axis direction is mainly due to the distinct grain boundary
   interface density in the Z-axis direction between the two welding modes.}},

Abstract = {{Hepatovirus A is known as a waterborne and foodborne virus that can be
   transmitted from one person to another through contaminated water and
   raw food. Therefore, it is necessary to survey the circulation of this
   type of enteric virus in the wastewater to prevent prospective
   outbreaks. Wastewater samples collected from WWTP El Menzeh I and
   Charguia I have been the subject for physicochemical, bacteriological
   (MPN) and virological analyses. Hepatovirus A (HAV) detection was
   carried out using the standard reverse transcription-polymerase chain
   reaction (RT-PCR). Hepatovirus A was detected respectively in 62\%
   (63/102) and 66\% (92/140) of the collected wastewater samples at El
   Menzeh I and Charguia I WWTPs. The treated effluent by natural oxidizing
   lagoon procedure was characterized by a poor physical-chemical and
   virological qualities but with excellent bacteriological quality.
   Consequently, this effluent is not suitable to be recycled and reused in
   agriculture or even dismissed in the environment. The treated sewage by
   activated sludge and rotating biodisk procedures turned out to be of a
   very good physical-chemical quality but with a poor bacteriological and
   virological quality. After tertiary UV-C-254 nm irradiation, the faecal
   indicator bacteria concentration was mostly reduced and removed. These
   findings confirmed the need for improvement and upgrade of the treatment
   processes used in these two studied sewage purification plants and the
   necessity of implementation and establishment of a proper national
   virological standard to control the circulation rates of enteric viruses
   in Tunisian municipal wastewater.}},

Abstract = {{Mood-related disorders have a high prevalence among children and
   adolescents, posing a public health challenge, given their adverse
   impact on these young populations. Treatment with the selective
   serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (FLX) is the first line of
   pharmacological intervention in pediatric patients suffering from
   affect-related illnesses. Although the use of this antidepressant has
   been deemed efficacious in the juvenile population, the enduring
   neurobiological consequences of adolescent FLX exposure are not well
   understood. Therefore, we explored for persistent molecular adaptations,
   in the adult hippocampus, as a function of adolescent FLX pretreatment.
   To do this, we administered FLX (20 mg/kg/day) to male C57BL/6 mice
   during adolescence (postnatal day {[}PD] 35-49). After a 21-day washout
   period (PD70), whole hippocampal tissue was dissected. We then used qPCR
   analysis to assess changes in the expression of genes associated with
   major intracellular signal transduction pathways, including the
   extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), the
   phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway, and the wingless
   (Wnt)-dishevelled-GSK3 beta signaling cascade. Our results show that FLX
   treatment results in long-term dysregulation of mRNA levels across
   numerous genes from the ERK, PI3K/AKT, and Wnt intracellular signaling
   pathways, along with increases of the transcription factors CREB, Delta
   FosB, and Zif268. Lastly, FLX treatment resulted in persistent increases
   of transcripts associated with cytoskeletal integrity (beta-actin) and
   caspase activation (DIABLO), while decreasing genes associated with
   metabolism (fucose kinase) and overall neuronal activation (c-Fos).
   Collectively, these data indicate that adolescent FLX exposure mediates
   persistent alterations in hippocampal gene expression in adulthood, thus
   questioning the safety of early-life exposure to this antidepressant
   medication.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{842}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{This study focuses on (In2O3)(x)(NiO)(100-x) nanocomposites intended to
   be used in supercapacitors as electrode materials. Nanocomposites with
   different ratios of NiO and In2O3 have been synthesized and
   characterized using XRD, FTIR, TEM and UV-visible spectroscopy. The
   bandgap energy (E-g) data reveals that the minimum value of Eg in
   (In2O3)(x)(NiO)(100-x) nanocomposites is associated with the formation
   of p-n heterojunction, for (In2O3)(50)(NiO)(50) nanocomposite, based on
   its highest electrical resistance, obtained through I-V measurement. The
   electrochemical measurements depict the pseudocapacitive behaviour of
   (In2O3)(x)(NiO)(100-x) nanocomposites. The CV analysis shows the highest
   specific capacitance for (In2O3)(30)(NiO)(70) nanocomposite, i.e., 340,
   472, 782, 1002, 1381 and 2628 Fg(-1) at different scan rates 100, 50,
   20, 10, 5 and 1 mVs(-1) respectively. Specific discharge capacitance of
   the same sample is measured as 831, 707, 658 and 449 Fg(-1) at 1, 2, 3
   and 4 Ag-1 current densities respectively. The strong interaction
   between closely packed In2O3 and NiO interfaces show the superior
   specific capacitance in (In2O3)(30)(NiO) (70) nanocomposites compared to
   neat NiO and In2O3 nanostructure, thus making (In2O3)(x)(NiO)(100-x) (x
   = 30) nanocomposite a suitable candidate for electrode material in
   electrochemical application. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{Autistic children do not consistently show conventional signs of social
   engagement, which some have interpreted to mean that they are not
   interested in connecting with other people. If someone does not act like
   they are interested in connecting with you, it may make it difficult to
   feel connected to them. And yet, some parents report feeling strongly
   connected to their autistic children. We conducted phenomenological
   interviews with 13 mothers to understand how they experienced connection
   with their 5- to 14-year-old nonspeaking autistic children. Mothers of
   nonspeaking autistic children represent a unique group in which to study
   connection because their children both may not seem interested in
   connecting with them and have limited ability to communicate effectively
   using speech, a common way people connect with each other. The mothers
   in this study interpreted a range of child behaviors-some
   unconventional, but many conventional-as signs that their children were
   interested in connecting with them, (re)framed child behaviors that
   could undermine connection as caused by factors unrelated to the
   relationship, and expressed several convictions that may help build and
   sustain connection in the face of uncertainty about the meaning of their
   children's behavior. Even though their autistic children may not
   consistently act in conventional socially oriented ways, these mothers
   reported perceiving their children's behavior as embedded within an
   emotionally reciprocal relationship.}},

Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{In the field of spaceborne long-distance non-cooperative target ranging,
   usually the target is weak and the imaging frame rate is limited, and
   thus the target tracking ability is limited and influences the ranging
   distance. When the spaceborne long-distance non-cooperative target is
   tracked, the main source of tracking errors is body vibration. In order
   to enhance the active vibration suppression ability and improve the
   tracking accuracy of the system, adaptive control is used to realize
   aiming control of targets. Aiming at the problem of difficult data
   fusion among different frequency sensors, we use down-sampling to
   achieve adaptive fusion of low-frequency camera data and high-frequency
   inertial sensor data, and simultaneously confirm the effectiveness and
   correctness of adaptive filtering under down-sampling. At the level of
   algorithm implementation, an affine projection algorithm is selected to
   achieve data fusion considering the problems of slow convergence and
   poor steady-state accuracy of the classical adaptive algorithm. In the
   data fusion simulation, the micro-vibration model of the satellite is
   used to verify the convergence speed and the tracking accuracy of the
   fusion method. Finally, this method is applied for the actual tracking
   system and the experimental results show that the tracking accuracy is
   superior to 5 mu rad, which meets the tracking accuracy requirement of
   long-distance non-cooperative target ranging.}},

Abstract = {{Cancer therapies kill tumors either directly or indirectly by evoking
   immune responses and have been combined with varying levels of success.
   Here, we describe a paradigm to control cancer growth that is based on
   both direct tumor killing and the triggering of protective immunity.
   Genetic ablation of serine protease inhibitor SerpinB9 (Sb9) results in
   the death of tumor cells in a granzyme B (GrB)-dependent manner.
   Sb9-deficient mice exhibited protective T cell-based host immunity to
   tumors in association with a decline in GrB-expressing immunosuppressive
   cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Maximal protection
   against tumor development was observed when the tumor and host were
   deficient in Sb9. The therapeutic utility of Sb9 inhibition was
   demonstrated by the control of tumor growth, resulting in increased
   survival times in mice. Our studies describe a molecular target that
   permits a combination of tumor ablation, interference within the TME,
   and immunotherapy in one potential modality.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a two-phase evolutionary algorithm framework for
   solving multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs), which allows
   different users to flexibly handle MOPs with different existing
   algorithms. In the first phase, a specific multi-objective evolutionary
   algorithm (MOEA) with a smaller population size is adopted to fast
   obtain a population converging to the true Pareto front. Then, in the
   second phase, a simple environmental selection mechanism based on a
   measure function and a well-designed crowdedness function is used to
   promote the uniformity of population in the objective space. Based on
   the proposed framework, we form four instantiations by embedding four
   distinct MOEAs into the first phase of the proposed framework. In the
   experimental study, different experiments are conducted on a variety of
   well-known benchmark problems from 3 to 10 objectives, and experimental
   results demonstrate the effect of the proposed framework. Furthermore,
   compared with several state-of-the-art multi-objective evolutionary
   algorithms, the four instantiations of the proposed framework have
   better performance and can obtain well-distributed solution sets. In
   short, the proposed framework has the strong ability to promote the
   performance of existing algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{In several experimental conditions, neuronal excitation at the
   perirhinal cortex (PC) does not propagate to the entorhinal cortex (EC)
   due to a ``wall{''} of inhibition, which may help to create functional
   coupling and un-coupling of the PC and EC in the medial temporal lobe.
   However, little is known regarding the coupling control process. Herein,
   we propose that the deep layer of area 35 in the PC plays a pivotal role
   in opening the gate for coupling, thus allowing the activity in the PC
   to propagate to the EC. Using voltage-sensitive dye imaging for the
   brain slices of rodents, we show that a slowly inactivating potassium
   conductance in this area is essential to induce excitation overtaking
   the inhibitory control. This coupling between the distinct neural
   circuits persists for at least 1 h. We elucidate further implications of
   this network-level plastic behavior and its mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Discontinuous dewetting (DD) is an attractive technique that enables the
   production of large liquid arrays in microwells and is applicable to the
   synthesis of anisotropic microparticles with complex morphologies.
   However, such loading of liquids into microwells presents a significant
   challenge, as the liquids used in this technique should exhibit low mold
   surface wettability. This study introduces DD in a degassed mold (DM), a
   simple yet powerful technique that achieves uniform loading of
   microparticle precursors into large microwell arrays within 1 min. Using
   this technique, hydrogel microparticles are produced by different
   polymerization mechanisms with various shapes and sizes, ranging from a
   few micrometers to hundreds of micrometers. Hydrophobic oil
   microparticles are produced by the simple plasma treatment of the DM,
   and agarose microparticles encapsulating bovine serum albumin (in a
   well-dispersed state) are produced by submerging the DM in fluorinated
   oil. To demonstrate additional functionality of microparticles using
   this technique, high concentrations of magnetic nanoparticles are loaded
   into microparticles for particle-based immunoassays performed in a
   microwell plate, and the immunoassay performance is comparable to that
   of ELISA.}},

Abstract = {{Dieckol is a brown algae-derived polyphenol that has broad bioactivity
   and low toxicity. Therefore, it is a promising lead compound for the
   development of therapeutic agents to treat various pathological
   conditions, including viral infections, allergies, diabetes, skin
   ageing, cancers, and neurodegenerative conditions. To exploit the
   pharmacological potential of dieckol, its stability, solubility,
   pharmacokinetics, and drug delivery must be improved. This can be
   achieved by the controlled modification of the hydroxyl groups, but the
   presence of eleven nearly equivalent hydroxyl groups makes the task
   highly challenging. In this study, the regioselectivities in five
   substitution reactions of the hydroxyl groups of dieckol under various
   S(N)2 reaction conditions were investigated. After reaction
   optimization, five substituents (methyl, benzyl, methoxymethyl,
   3-hydroxypropyl, and 3-(ethoxycarbonyl)propyl) could be introduced at
   the 6-Oposition of dieckol with surprisingly high regioselectivity, as
   confirmed by 2D-NMR spectroscopic analyses. The prepared dieckol
   derivatives showed antioxidant and anticancer activities analogous to
   those of unmodified dieckol, indicating that the mono-O-substitutions
   did not affect the biochemical and biological characteristics of
   dieckol. Therefore, the proposed methodology for the mono-O-substitution
   of a specific oxygen of dieckol is a powerful tool to add various
   pharmaceutical attributes to dieckol, thus contributing to the
   development of various dieckol-based drug candidates. (C) 2020 The

   or the control group in a course in bioscience. The outcome measures are
   the proportion of students who passed the examination, and the
   distribution of grades from A to E. Chi-square tests and Mann-Whitney
   Wilcoxon test were used. The odds to pass versus fail were modelled
   using binary logistic regression.
   Results: The proportion of students who did not pass the final
   examination was very similar in the intervention and the control groups,
   21.4\% and 23.6\% (p = .574). Our data did not reveal any statistically
   significant differences concerning the distribution of grades (p =
   .691). Students with biology and/or natural science had higher odds for
   passing.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess white
   matter injury in preterm brains, increasingly recognize punctate white
   matter lesions (PWML) as the primary lesion type. There are some papers
   showing the relationship between the size and number of PWML and the
   prognosis of infants. However, the histopathological features are still
   unknown. In this study, we experimentally induced periventricular
   leukomalacia (PVL) in a sheep fetus model, aiming to find whether MRI
   can visualize necrotic foci (small incipient lesions of PVL) as PWML.
   Three antenatal insults were employed to induce PVL in preterm fetuses
   at gestational day 101-117: (i) hypoxia under intrauterine inflammation,
   (ii) restriction of artificial placental blood flow, and (iii)
   restriction of artificial placental blood flow after exposure to
   intrauterine inflammation. MRI was performed 3-5 days after the insults,
   and standard histological studies of the PVL validated its findings. Of
   the 89 necrotic foci detected in histological samples from nine fetuses
   with PVL, 78 were visualized as PWML. Four of the lesions detected as
   abnormal findings on MRI could not be histologically detected as
   corresponding abnormal findings. The diagnostic sensitivity and positive
   predictive values of histologic focal necrosis visualized as PWML were
   0.92 and 0.95, respectively. The four lesions were excluded from these
   analyses. These data suggest that MRI can visualize PVL necrotic foci as
   PWML 3-5 days after the injury induction. PWML can spontaneously become
   obscure with time after birth, so their accurate diagnosis in the acute
   phase can prevent overlooking mild PVL.}},

Abstract = {{We report a combined experimental and theoretical study on magnetism and
   magneto-electric coupling in howardevansite-type mixed-spin chain
   compounds ACuFe(2)(VO4)(3) (A = Li, Na). While LiCuFe2(VO4)(3) shows
   long-range magnetic order and spin-order-induced ferroelectricity, i.e.,
   multiferroicity of type II, neither magnetic order nor magneto-electric
   effects are observed in the Na-based sister compound. Notably, our local
   magnetic probes studies by means of NMR, ESR, and Mossbauer spectroscopy
   evidence similar magnetic behavior of both compounds at the time scales
   of these experiments. This is confirmed by first principles calculations
   which imply a similar hierarchy of exchange interaction parameters. Our
   results suggest that the absence of magneto-electric effects in
   NaCuFe2(VO4)(3) as seen in bulk measurements is a disorder effect
   associated with lower mobility of Na ions within the channels of the
   crystal structure as compared to the mobility of Li ions, thereby
   presenting a yet disregarded degree of freedom to tune the
   multiferroicity. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sensory discrimination is essential for survival. However, how sensory
   information is finely controlled in the brain is not well defined. Here,
   we show that astrocytes control tactile acuity via tonic inhibition in
   the thalamus. Mechanistically, diamine oxidase (DAO) and the subsequent
   aldehyde dehydrogenase 1a1 (Aldh1a1) convert putrescine into GABA, which
   is released via Best1 The GABA from astrocytes inhibits synaptically
   evoked firing at the lemniscal synapses to fine-tune the dynamic range
   of the stimulation-response relationship, the precision of spike timing,
   and tactile discrimination. Our findings reveal a novel role of
   astrocytes in the control of sensory acuity through tonic GABA release.}},

Abstract = {{The outcome of the 1948 war in Palestine resulted not only in the
   country's partition between the state of Israel and the Kingdom of
   Jordan but also in the division of its archaeological research. The
   Jordanian Department of Antiquities, which was responsible for
   administering archaeological research in the West Bank until 1967,
   prioritized research in the East Bank over research in the West Bank as
   a function of broader Jordanian government policy. The bulk of the
   research in the West Bank during this period was conducted by foreign
   institutions and researchers, who were forced to choose between
   researching in Israel and researching in the Arab countries, including
   the West Bank. Those who chose to research in Israel were denied the
   ability to simultaneously research and excavate in the West Bank. In
   this way, the choice of the foreign researchers divided them, placing
   them on the two different sides of the `Green Line'.
   The excavations in the West Bank piqued the curiosity of the Israelis,
   who never ceased trying to acquire information about them and their
   findings. These efforts included secret meetings with foreign
   researchers, attempts to acquire the Qumran scrolls, and the secret
   transfer to Israel of a few findings for the sake of secret research.
   For many years, part of their story remained classified in archives. It
   is shared here for the first time.}},

Abstract = {{Optimized thermal emitters using optical resonances have been attracting
   increased attention for diverse applications, such as infrared (IR)
   sensing, thermal imaging, gas sensing, thermophotovoltaics, thermal
   camouflage, and radiative cooling. Depending on the applications, the
   recently developed IR devices have been tailored to achieve not only
   spectrally engineered emission but also spatially resolved emission
   using various nanometallic structures, metamaterials, and multistacking
   layers, which accompany high structural complexity and prohibitive
   production cost. Herein, this article presents a simple and affordable
   approach to obtain spatially and spectrally selective hybrid thermal
   emitters (HTEs) based on spoof surface plasmons of microscaled Ag
   grooves manifested in encapsulation polymer layers. Theoretical analyses
   found that the polymer hybrid plasmonics allows diverse emission tuning
   within the long-wave IR (LWIR; 8-14 mu m) region as follows: (1)
   spatially selective emission peaks only exist in the interface of Ag
   grooves and IR-transparent layers and (2) near-unity spectrally
   selective emission is obtained by refining inherent emissivity of a thin
   IR-opaque layer. Also, parametric studies computationally optimized the
   structural parameters for spatially and spectrally selective HTEs. Using
   the optimized parameters, the authors fabricated two HTEs and
   demonstrated the intriguing emission features in terms of infrared data
   encoding/decoding and radiative cooling, respectively. These successful
   demonstrations open up the applicability of HTEs for tailoring IR
   emission in a spatially and spectrally selective manner.}},

Abstract = {{South Florida (USA) has a subtropical to tropical climate with an
   extensive and diverse coastline that supports the growth of benthic
   cyanobacterial mats (BCMs). These BCMs are widespread and potentially
   house numerous bioactive compounds; however, the extent of the
   cyanobacterial diversity within these mats remains largely unknown. To
   elucidate this diversity, BCMs from select locations in South Florida
   were sampled and isolated into unicyanobacterial cultures for
   morphological and molecular studies. Phylogenetic relationships of
   isolated taxa were assessed using the markers 16S rRNA and 16S-23S rRNA
   ITS by both maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. We propose
   Affixifilum gen. nov. based on morphological characteristics and the 16S
   rRNA phylogeny. Two species are included: Affixifilum granulosum comb
   nov. (=Neolyngbya granulosa) found in Brazil and Florida (USA) and A.
   floridanum sp. nov. Several other features, including pair-wise distance
   of 16S rRNA and 16S-23S rRNA ITS, 16S-23S rRNA ITS secondary structure,
   morphology, and ecology, provide support for Affixifilum. We also
   propose the transfer of Lyngbya regalis to Neolyngbya as N. regalis
   comb. nov. and include the description of one novel species, N.
   biscaynensis sp. nov.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel implicit family of composite two sub-step
   algorithms with controllable dissipations is developed to effectively
   solve nonlinear structural dynamic problems. The primary superiority of
   the present method over other existing integration methods lies that it
   is truly self-starting and so the computation of initial acceleration
   vector is avoided, but the second-order accurate acceleration responses
   can be provided. Besides, the present method also achieves other desired
   numerical characteristics, such as the second-order accuracy of three
   primary variables, unconditional stability and no overshoots.
   Particularly, the novel method achieves adjustable numerical
   dissipations in the low and high frequency by controlling its two
   algorithmic parameters (gamma and rho(infinity)). The classical
   dissipative parameter rho(infinity) determines numerical dissipations in
   the high-frequency while gamma adjusts numerical dissipations in the
   low-frequency. Linear and nonlinear numerical examples are given to show
   the superiority of the novel method over existing integration methods
   with respect to accuracy and overshoot.}},

Abstract = {{Many tourism travel decisions are interrelated. From modelling viewpoint
   incorporating these interrelations is important for understanding the
   consequences of exogenous shocks, as well as the intended and unintended
   consequences of policy. This paper addresses two tourist choices in the
   temporal dimension that were previously only handled as if they were
   mutually exclusive. The paper adopts a discrete-continuous model
   framework to simulate tourists' behaviours in selecting travel seasons
   (choice model) and associated trip duration (accelerated failure time
   model) and estimates the correlation between these two tourism decisions
   conditional on the covariates. The empirical analysis is based on
   Australian domestic tourism data and reveal the factors influencing both
   decisions as well as those that influence only one or the other. The
   model results, which is tested with data from select years between
   1999-2018, including years of significant exogenous shocks, show mixed
   evidence of stability and changes in the parameters. Building on this
   evidence, the paper concludes with underlying temporal choice behaviours
   of tourists that may be of relevance during- and post-COVID19
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{Constructing a cocatalyst-free semiconductor catalyst with high
   catalytic efficiency has great significance to photocatalytic hydrogen
   (H-2) production. Herein, by incorporating diethylenetriamine (DETA)
   into inorganic materials (CdS), an organic-inorganic hybrid, CdS-DETA
   (CD), and a snowflake-like Cu2S p-n heterojunction were designed by the
   hydrothermal synthesis method. The photocatalytic H2 generation rate of
   Cu2S/CD (CU/CD) can reach 9.00 mmol.g(-1).h(-1), which is 1.25, 5.03,
   and 6.12 times higher than that of H-2 produced by Pt/CD, CD, and CdS
   nanorods (CdS NRs), respectively. Under the action of the organic
   molecule DETA, the photocorrosion of CdS is effectively inhibited. The
   Cu2S snowflakes and the organici-norganic hybrid CD tight-contact
   interface and the p-n heterojunction improve the charge separation
   efficiency in the composite and enhance the photocatalytic activity.

Abstract = {{This study aimed to study the effect and mechanism of action of
   SO2-induced oxidation on human skin keratinocytes. Different
   concentrations of SO2 derivatives (0, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 mu
   M) were used for treating HaCaT keratinocytes for 24 hours. MTT was used
   to evaluate the effect of each concentration on cell proliferation.
   HaCaT cells were randomly divided into control and SO2 groups. The
   control group received no treatment, whereas the SO2 group was treated
   with SO2 derivatives of selected concentrations for 24 hours. The levels
   of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide
   dismutase (SOD), tumor necrosis factor TNF-alpha (TNF-alpha), and
   interleukin-1 (IL-1-beta) in cell supernatants were detected using
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Real-time polymerase chain reaction
   was used to detect the expression of nuclear transcription factor (Nrf2)
   and heme oxygenase (HO)-1 mRNA. The Western blot analysis was used to
   test the expression levels of Nrf2, HO-1, activated caspase-3, Bcl-2,
   Bax, I kappa B, NF-kappa B p65 (p65), ERK1/2, p38, phospho-NF-kappa B
   p65 (p-p65), p-ERK1/2, and p-p38. SO2 derivatives (100, 200, 400, and
   800 mu M) could inhibit cell proliferation. SO2 derivatives increased
   the level of ROS, MDA, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, Nrf2, HO-1, and p-p65/p65
   and decreased the levels of SOD, I kappa B, p-ERK1/2/ERK1/2, and
   p-p38/p38 compared with the control group, but they had no effect on the
   levels of caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax. SO2 could inhibit the proliferation
   of human skin keratinocytes and induce oxidative stress and inflammation
   via the activation of the NF-kappa B pathway to inhibit the ERK1/2 and
   p38 pathways.}},

Abstract = {{Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are a group of enzymes that have a crucial
   role in controlling oxidative stress in plants. Here, we synthesized an
   environmentally friendly SOD mimic, SODm-123, from L-aspartic acid and
   manganese oxide. SODm-123 showed similar enzymatic activity to Mn-SOD.
   To gain insights into the role of SODm-123 in oxidative stress
   tolerance, a series of experiments were conducted to assess the
   physiological and molecular responses of tomato plants when treated with
   SODm-123. The results showed that the levels of O-2(-center dot) and
   H2O2 in tomato cells were affected by SODm-123 treatment, indicating
   that SODm-123 can control oxidative stress like Mn-SOD. The results also
   exhibited that SODm-123 increased the contents of photosynthetic
   pigments. However, it was noted that SODm-123 resulted in a reduction in
   the content of soluble sugar and MDA. These results indicate that
   SODm-123 promoted the efficiency of photosynthesis by regulating the
   content of H2O2. To further investigate the role of SODm-123 in
   controlling oxidative stress, a transcriptome analysis was used to
   identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with SODm-123
   treatment. The results indicated that SODm-123 treatment resulted in 341
   differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in treated tomato leaves at 96 h
   after treatment. Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) revealed
   that DEGs were involved in pathways such as photosynthetic pigment
   biosynthesis, ABC transporters, sugar metabolism, and MAPK signaling,
   which further confirmed a positive role of SODm-123 in improving stress
   tolerance in plants. Overall, the results of this study suggest that
   SODm-123 promotes the growth and development of tomato seedlings and
   therefore can be used as a potential growth-promoting agent for plants.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative reconstructions of past climates are an important resource
   for evaluating how well climate models reproduce climate changes. One
   widely used statistical approach for making such reconstructions from
   fossil biotic assemblages is weighted averaging partial least-squares
   regression (WA-PLS). There is however a known tendency for WA-PLS to
   yield reconstructions compressed towards the centre of the climate range
   used for calibration, potentially biasing the reconstructed past
   climates. We present an improvement of WA-PLS by assuming that: (i) the
   theoretical abundance of each taxon is unimodal with respect to the
   climate variable considered; (ii) observed taxon abundances follow a
   multinomial distribution in which the total abundance of a sample is
   climatically uninformative; and (iii) the estimate of the climate value
   at a given site and time makes the observation most probable, i.e. it
   maximizes the log-likelihood function. This climate estimate is
   approximated by weighting taxon abundances in WA-PLS by the inverse
   square of their climate tolerances. We further improve the approach by
   considering the frequency ( fx) of the climate variable in the training
   dataset. Tolerance-weighted WA-PLS with fx correction greatly reduces
   the compression bias, compared with WA-PLS, and improves model
   performance in reconstructions based on an extensive modern pollen
   dataset.}},

Abstract = {{Pharmacological therapies for the treatment of cocaine addiction have
   had disappointing efficacy, and the lack of recent developments in the
   clinical care of cocaine-addicted patients indicates a need for novel
   treatment strategies. Recent studies have shown that vaccination against
   cocaine to elicit production of antibodies that reduce concentrations of
   free drug in the blood is a promising method to protect against the
   effects of cocaine and reduce rates of relapse. However, the poorly
   immunogenic nature of cocaine remains a major hurdle to active
   immunization. Therefore, we hypothesized that strategies to increase
   targeted exposure of cocaine to the immune system may produce a more
   effective vaccine. To specifically direct an immune response against
   cocaine, in the present study we have conjugated a cocaine analog to a
   dendrimer-based nanoparticle carrier with MHC II-binding moieties that
   previously has been shown to activate antigen-presenting cells necessary
   for antibody production. This strategy produced a rapid, prolonged, and
   high affinity anti-cocaine antibody response without the need for an
   adjuvant. Surprisingly, additional evaluation using multiple adjuvant
   formulations in two strains of inbred mice found adjuvants were either
   functionally redundant or deleterious in the vaccination against cocaine
   using this platform. The use of conditioned place preference in rats
   after administration of this vaccine provided proof of concept for the
   ability of this vaccine to diminish cocaine reward. Together these data
   demonstrate the intrinsic efficacy of an immune-targeting
   dendrimer-based cocaine vaccine, with a vast potential for design of
   future vaccines against other poorly immunogenic antigens by
   substitution of the conjugated cargo. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Climate change is a complex issue and understanding it is not an easy
   endeavour. An abundance of information is available through media and a
   lot of research has dealt with the question of how to best communicate
   this issue to the public. However, uncertainty and scepticism remain. In
   this paper, we argue that the subjective capability of informing oneself
   satisfactorily about climate change (i.e. informational self-efficacy)
   to reach goals like forming an opinion, evaluating political decisions
   regarding climate change, or behaving in a climate protective manner
   might be a crucial determinant of people's engagement with the issue. In
   an online survey with a quota sample of German residents (N = 498),
   informational self-efficacy positively predicted people's exposure to
   climate change communication in the media, their knowledge about the
   climate system and climate protective behaviours, and the extent to
   which they actually engaged in climate protective actions. Moreover,
   informational self-efficacy positively predicted climate protective
   behaviour and climate system knowledge indirectly through media
   exposure-but not behavioural knowledge. Hence, next to optimising the
   provided climate change communication, we suggest to strengthen people's
   confidence in dealing with it through media literacy trainings and
   examine the causal effect of these trainings on informational
   self-efficacy and climate change engagement. Furthermore, the impact of
   different behaviours on climate change should be more often and more
   concretely discussed in media coverage.}},

Abstract = {{The corrosion behavior of a Fe50Mn30Co10Cr10 dual-phase high-entropy
   alloy (DP-HEA) in NaCl solution was investigated in this study. All the
   corrosion results were compared with those of an equiatomic CoCrFeMnNi
   high-entropy alloy (HEA). The corrosion product films that formed on the
   surface of both alloys after immersion in NaCl for 14 days were directly
   imaged for the first time through high-resolution transmission electron
   microscopy (HR-TEM). Both of the alloys exhibited similar passivation
   and positive hysteresis processes in the potentiodynamic polarization
   test. However, the Fe50Mn30Co10Cr10 DP-HEA exhibited a narrower passive
   region and lower pitting potential (E-pit) value compared with the
   CoCrFeMnNi HEA. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results suggested
   that the CoCrFeMnNi HEA has better corrosion resistance performance than
   the Fe50Mn30Co10Cr10 DP-HEA in a NaCl solution. HR-TEM observations
   indicated that the Fe50Mn30Co10Cr10 DP-HEA formed a thicker corrosion
   product film (similar to 12 nmvs similar to 3 nm for the CoCrFeMnNi HEA)
   after it was immersed in NaCl solution for 14 days. Moreover, Auger
   electron spectroscopy results revealed that the corrosion product film
   on the Fe50Mn30Co10Cr10 DP-HEA contained higher Mn content and lower Cr
   and Fe content than the films on the CoCrFeMnNi HEAs. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Transdermal drug delivery (TDD) is an important drug delivery method,
   and cold atmospheric plasma has been proven its potential as a TDD
   approach. In this study, a 9-channel plasma jet array was designed to
   enhance TDD efficiency. The Franz diffusion experiment showed that the
   TDD efficiency of the drug across the skin was enhanced about 2-110
   times after the plasma jet array treatment. The histological analysis
   showed that the structure of the stratum corneum could be destroyed by
   the plasma. Further investigations indicated that the reactive oxygen
   species of the plasma jet play a key role in enhancing TDD efficiency.
   Our results indicated that the plasma jet array is a potential and
   effective TDD approach.}},

Abstract = {{When kinetic conditions dominate and dictate the growth in a
   nanoparticle synthesis, properties of the synthesis environment can have
   considerable effects on the properties of the products. Such effects
   were studied here, where the solution environment was changed via the
   addition of KF to the hydrothermal syntheses of KTa1-xNbxO3 and KTaO3.
   One result demonstrated the straightforward cause-and-effect
   relationship between the solution and reaction kinetics: KF directly
   increased the solution stability of the Ta species and therefore
   decreased its reaction rate, resulting in a change in composition
   heterogeneity of Ta and Nb in the KTa1-xNbxO3 particles. However, not
   all effects are so simple; changing the chemical potential of the
   solution with KF can also promote the formation of particles with
   anisotropic defect enhanced kinetic Wulff shapes instead of cuboidal
   shapes. The increased F chemical potential in the solution enabled the
   formation of planar defects in the bulk, which accelerated growth
   in-plane to form particles characterized by flat rectangular flake
   geometries. Thermodynamic modeling with density functional theory
   calculations confirmed that sufficient KF concentrations can drive the
   formation of a defect phase Kn+1TanO3nF.}},

Title = {{Outcomes of hip arthroplasty with concomitant hardware removal:
   influence of the type of implant retrieved and impact of positive
   intraoperative cultures}},

Abstract = {{Introduction The impact of residual internal fixation devices on
   subsequent procedures about the hip has not been clearly well defined.
   The objective of the current study is to evaluate the outcome of hip
   arthroplasty after hardware retrieval as a one-stage replacement, to
   analyze possible differences related to the type of removed implant, and
   to assess the impact of unexpected intraoperative cultures during
   implant retrieval. Materials and methods We present a retrospective
   study including all those cases undergoing hip arthroplasty with
   concomitant hardware removal (cannulated screws, intramedullary nail, or
   dynamic hip screw) from 2005 to 2018. We evaluated demographics,
   intraoperative cultures, early infection rate, and other complications.
   Results A total of 55 cases were included in the study. The median time
   between the implant surgery and the hip arthroplasty was 113 days. The
   removed devices included 6 cannulated screws, 34 intramedullary nails,
   and 15 dynamic hip screws. Up to 74.5\% of the failed osteosynthesis
   belonged to intertrochanteric femoral fractures. Dislocation rate was
   9.1\% (1.8\% requiring revision surgery), 25.5\% of the cases needed
   further new surgeries after the hip arthroplasty, and 49.1\% died during
   the follow-up period. Any-cause revision surgery and mortality rates
   were significantly increased after intramedullary nail removal.
   Intraoperative cultures were performed in 46 cases, and in 9 (16.4\%),
   there was bacterial contamination: 6 cases (10.9\%) presented one single
   positive culture and 3 (5.5\%) presented >= 2 positive cultures for the
   same microorganism. A total of five cases (9.1\%) presented early
   prosthetic joint infection that required debridement. None of these five
   cases had presented positive cultures at the implant removal. Conclusion
   According to our results, hip arthroplasty with concomitant hardware
   removal is related to a high 5-year mortality rate, mainly when
   intramedullary nail is retrieved. Whereas a high risk of early
   prosthetic joint infection is associated, it seems not to be related to
   the elevated presence of unexpected positive cultures.}},

Abstract = {{Knowing the displacement capacity and mobility patterns of industrially
   exploited (i.e., fished) marine resources is key to establishing
   effective conservation management strategies in human-impacted marine
   ecosystems. Acquiring accurate behavioral information of deep-sea fished
   ecosystems is necessary to establish the sizes of marine protected areas
   within the framework of large international societal programs (e.g.,
   European Community H2020, as part of the Blue Growth economic strategy).
   However, such information is currently scarce, and high-frequency and
   prolonged data collection is rarely available. Here, we report the
   implementation of autonomous underwater vehicles and remotely operated
   vehicles as an aid for acoustic long-baseline localization systems for
   autonomous tracking of Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus), one of the
   key living resources exploited in European waters. In combination with
   seafloor moored acoustic receivers, we detected and tracked the
   movements of 33 tagged lobsters at 400-m depth for more than 3 months.
   We also identified the best procedures to localize both the acoustic
   receivers and the tagged lobsters, based on algorithms designed for
   off-the-shelf acoustic tags identification. Autonomous mobile platforms
   that deliver data on animal behavior beyond traditional fixed platform
   capabilities represent an advance for prolonged, in situ monitoring of
   deep-sea benthic animal behavior at meter spatial scales.}},

Title = {{Buoyancy-driven melting and heat transfer around a horizontal cylinder
   in square enclosure filled with phase change material}},
Journal = {{APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{181}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{This work primarily focuses on designing a cost effective method
   yielding high rate of heat transfer from a heated object to ensure the
   faster melting of the phase change material (PCM). A numerical
   investigation has been performed on the laminar natural convection from
   a two-dimensional heated circular cylinder confined in a square
   enclosure filled with a phase change material, namely, the lauric acid.
   In particular, the coupled momentum and energy equations are solved to
   delineate the influence of the geometric position of the cylinder within
   the square enclosure on the melt and heat transfer characteristics of
   the phase change material. The solid-liquid phase change is formulated
   using the enthalpy-porosity technique. The detailed velocity and
   temperature fields are visualized in terms of velocity vectors, isotherm
   contours, melt fraction contours, melting rate, energy storage and
   surface averaged Nusselt number. The results reported herein are
   restricted to the six distinct geometrical positions (i.e., four
   symmetric and two asymmetric) of the cylinder within the enclosure. The
   rate of convective heat transport and hence the melt fraction is found
   to decrease with the increasing distance of the cylinder from the base
   of the enclosure. In addition, the influence of the mushy zone parameter
   (A(mush)) on the melting behaviour has also been explored. The reported
   numerical results for the melt fraction have been correlated as a
   function of the melting time and the geometric positions of the heated
   cylinder. Finally, one can conclude that it is possible to realize an
   enhanced rate of melting and energy storage simply by adjusting the
   location of the cylinder under confinement and thus the performance of a
   thermal energy storage (TES) system can remarkably be improved.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a microkinetic model to reveal the effects of
   plasma-generated radicals, intermediates, and vibrationally excited
   species on the catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to CH3OH on a Cu(111)
   surface. As a benchmark, we first present the mechanisms of thermal
   catalytic CH3OH formation. Our model predicts that the reverse water-gas
   shift reaction followed by CO hydrogenation, together with the formate
   path, mainly contribute to CH3OH formation in thermal catalysis. Adding
   plasma-generated radicals and intermediates results in a higher CH3OH
   turnover frequency (TOF) by six to seven orders of magnitude, showing
   the potential of plasma-catalytic CO2 hydrogenation into CH3OH, in
   accordance with the literature. In addition, CO2 vibrational excitation
   further increases the CH3OH TOF, but the effect is limited due to
   relatively low vibrational temperatures under typical plasma catalysis
   conditions. The predicted increase in CH3OH formation by plasma
   catalysis is mainly attributed to the increased importance of the
   formate path. In addition, the conversion of plasma-generated CO to
   HCO{*} and subsequent HCOO{*} or H2CO{*} formation contribute to CH3OH
   formation. Both pathways bypass the HCOO{*} formation from CO2, which is
   the main bottleneck in the process. Hence, our model points toward the
   important role of CO, but also O, OH, and H radicals, as they influence
   the reactions that consume CO2 and CO. In addition, our model reveals
   that the H pressure should not be smaller than ca. half of the O
   pressure in the plasma as this would cause O{*} poisoning, which would
   result in very small product TOFs. Thus, plasma conditions should be
   targeted with a high CO and H content as this is favorable for CH3OH
   formation, while the O content should be minimized.}},

Abstract = {{Chandrayaan-2, the second Indian mission to the Moon, carries a
   spectrometer called the Solar X-ray Monitor (XSM) to perform soft X-ray
   spectral measurements of the Sun while a companion payload, CLASS,
   measures the fluorescence emission from the Moon. Together these two
   payloads will provide quantitative estimates of elemental abundances on
   the lunar surface. The XSM with its high time cadence and high energy
   resolution spectral measurements, is also expected to provide
   significant contributions to solar X-ray studies. For this purpose, the
   XSM employs a Silicon Drift Detector and carries out energy measurements
   of incident photons in the 1 - 15 keV range with a resolution of < 180
   eV at 5.9 keV, over a wide range of solar X-ray intensities. Extensive
   ground calibration experiments have been carried out with the XSM using
   laboratory X-ray sources as well as X-ray beam-line facilities to
   determine the instrument response matrix parameters required to carry
   out quantitative spectral analysis. This includes measurements, under
   various observing conditions, of gain, spectral redistribution function,
   and effective area. The capability of the XSM to maintain its spectral
   performance at high incident flux as well as its dead-time and pile-up
   characteristics have also been investigated. The results of these ground
   calibration experiments of the XSM payload are presented in this
   article.}},

Title = {{Performance implications of combining creative and imitative innovation
   strategies}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate the performance
   effects of pure innovation strategies (creative and imitative) versus
   the combination of the two innovation strategies (combination innovation
   strategy) and to determine whether implementing the combination
   innovation strategy produces an incremental performance benefit over the
   pure innovation strategies. Design/methodology/approach We used archival
   data from the Korea Innovation Survey (KIS) completed by a large sample
   of South Korea manufacturing firms and some financial data provided by
   the South Korea Science and Technology Policy Institute (STEPI). We used
   hierarchical multiple regression analysis to analyze the data from 486
   firms. Findings The findings indicated that firms implementing any of
   the three innovation strategies of creative innovation, imitative
   innovation and combination innovation outperforms noninnovators. Results
   also show that while firms implementing the combination innovation
   strategy perform better than those implementing imitative innovation
   strategies, they do not significantly differ in performance from firms
   implementing the creative innovation strategy. Moreover, we find no
   performance difference between creative innovation and imitative
   innovation strategies. Practical implications The study highlights the
   importance of combination innovation strategies for manufacturing firms
   that rely on imitative innovation strategies to gain competitive
   advantage in the market. However, it demonstrates that firms that are
   successful in using creative innovation strategies must use their
   resources in exploiting that advantage. Originality/value Although
   extant studies have demonstrated the importance of both creative
   innovation and imitative innovation strategies in enhancing performance,
   it is not clear whether implementing both strategies at the same time
   has incremental value for firms. This study focusses on empirically
   examining the performance implications of creative innovation and
   imitative innovation strategies, and whether the pursuit of a
   combination innovation strategy (simultaneous pursuit of both innovation
   strategies) provides any incremental benefit is unique.}},

Abstract = {{Having knowledge of the contact network over which an infection is
   spreading opens the possibility of making individualized predictions for
   the likelihood of different nodes to become infected. When multiple
   infective strains attempt to spread simultaneously we may further ask
   which strain, or strains, are most likely to infect a particular node.
   In this article we investigate the heterogeneity in likely outcomes for
   different nodes in two models of multi-type epidemic spreading
   processes. For models allowing co-infection we derive message-passing
   equations whose solution captures how the likelihood of a given node
   receiving a particular infection depends on both the position of the
   node in the network and the interaction between the infection types. For
   models of competing epidemics in which co-infection is impossible, a
   more complicated analysis leads to the simpler result that node
   vulnerability factorizes into a contribution from the network topology
   and a contribution from the infection parameters.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY}},
Abstract = {{A novel recoverable photocatalyst g-C3N4 nanorods have been synthesised
   by using melamine and adopting the hydrothermal method. Graphitic carbon
   nitride has been characterised by a wide range of characterisation
   techniques like XRD, SEM, EDX, PL and FTIR. Their effect on degradation
   of organic dyes, methylene blue (MB), methylene orange (MO) and
   Rhodamine-B (Rh-B) have been studied along with factors of pH 0-5 and pH
   8-14. Remarkably, g-C3N4 could degrade 99\% of MO, 97\% of MB and 99.9\%
   of Rh-B with pH 0-5, and 97.7\% of MO, 98\% of MB and 99.5\% Rh-B with
   pH 8-12, respectively. This catalyst has superior dye degradation
   efficiency (99.9\% and 99.5\%) for Rh-B for both the factors pH 0-5 and
   pH 8-12. The trapping experiment results portrayed that the superoxide
   radical anion (center dot O-2-) and holes (h(+)) have played major role
   for the degradation of Rh-B, MB and MO dyes. Based on the trapping
   experiment results, a tentative photocatalytic mechanism has also been
   proposed.}},

Journal = {{ELIFE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{The Zebrafish Posterior Lateral Line primordium migrates in a channel
   between the skin and somites. Its migration depends on the coordinated
   movement of its mesenchymal-like leading cells and trailing cells, which
   form epithelial rosettes, or protoneuromasts. We describe a superficial
   population of flat primordium cells that wrap around deeper
   epithelialized cells and extend polarized lamellipodia to migrate
   apposed to the overlying skin. Polarization of lamellipodia extended by
   both superficial and deeper protoneuromast-forming cells depends on Fgf
   signaling. Removal of the overlying skin has similar effects on
   superficial and deep cells: lamellipodia are lost, blebs appear instead,
   and collective migration fails. When skinned embryos are embedded in
   Matrigel, basal and superficial lamellipodia are recovered; however,
   only the directionality of basal protrusions is recovered, and migration
   is not rescued. These observations support a key role played by
   superficial primordium cells and the skin in directed migration of the
   Posterior Lateral Line primordium.}},

Journal = {{OSTEOPOROSIS INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{145-156}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Introduction We investigated the relationship between gut microbiota
   composition and osteoporosis/fracture risk in Japanese postmenopausal
   women using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, FRAX, bone mineral density,
   biochemical bone parameters, and a self-administered questionnaire.
   Variation in abundance of specific microbiota was found to be
   significantly associated with fracture risk and vitamin K levels. Gut
   microbiota data with respect to bone metabolism and fracture risk is
   limited. Vitamin K is produced by certain intestinal bacteria and has
   been reported to play a role in maintaining bone quality. Purpose We
   investigated relationships among gut microbiota composition, bone
   metabolism, and fracture risk in postmenopausal Japanese women. Methods
   Bone mineral density (BMD) was evaluated in 38 postmenopausal women
   (mean age 62.9 years) using forearm dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. We
   collected and analyzed serum bone turnover markers (vitamin K fraction
   and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b; TRACP-5b), gut microbiota
   profiling (16S rRNA gene sequencing), and self-administered
   questionnaire data, including fracture history and vitamin K intake.
   Vitamin K2, BMD, and TRACP-5b data were divided into high- and low-level
   groups using cutoff values of 0.06 ng/mL, 87.05\%, and 420 mU/dL,
   respectively; the proportions of bacteria were analyzed. Fracture
   incidence and relative risk were investigated for each bacterium.
   Results The genus Bacteroides was predominant in the high vitamin K2
   group (29.73\% vs 21.58\%, P = 0.022). Fracture incidence was
   significantly higher in the low Bacteroides group, with a 5.6-times
   higher risk ratio of fracture history. The family Rikenellaceae was more
   abundant in the low BMD group and more abundant in the high TRACP-5b
   group (2.15\% vs 0.82\%, P = 0.004; 2.38\% vs 1.12\%, P = 0.013,
   respectively). Conclusion Bacteroides and Rikenellaceae may be involved
   in bone metabolism and fracture risk. Further investigations of the
   underlying microbiota-related pathways in bone metabolism may reveal
   treatment strategies, and facilitate the prevention of osteoporosis.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a numerical and experimental study of four novel,
   desiccant air-conditioning systems based on pre-cooling of the ambient
   air. The purpose of the study is to: 1) establish which configuration is
   most profitable for the future studies through numerical and
   experimental methods; 2) verify the concept of precooled system and
   confirm that it is working in experimental conditions (for this purpose
   two prototypes of evaporative cooling units were developed and compared
   for different operation arrangements with desiccant wheel); 3) Analyze
   practical aspects of the systems, which includes water consumption
   analysis, economic analysis and establishing operational modes during a
   cooling season in temperate climate conditions (the proposed solution
   has a significant advantage during operation in a temperate climate,
   since it can utilize its first evaporative cooler the only source of
   cooling energy when the humidity of outdoor air allows to to meet the
   latent cooling load). Four arrangements of the system with different dew
   point evaporative air cooler prototypes were selected and developed for
   comparative analysis. The system was simulated as a whole, also, each
   component was individually tested on measurement station. develop the
   optimal arrangement of the system through numerical and experimental
   analysis. Four different performance indicators were considered: thermal
   COP (Coefficient Of Performance), the ERR (Energy Efficiency Ratio),
   coefficient a describing the potential in compensating indoor cooling
   loads, water consumption ratio. Also costs of the systems were compared
   through economic analysis. It was established that arrangement which is
   characterized by best-averaged performance in terms of all considered
   factors is a unit combined with two different types of evaporative
   coolers (marked as System B)- this is caused by the favorable
   arrangement of two units, where one is better suited to the pre-cooler
   role, while the other is better suited as the post-cooler.}},

Abstract = {{A theoretical study on the coupled electron-nuclear dynamics of HD+
   molecular ions under ultrashort, intense laser pulses is performed by
   employing a well-established quasi-classical model. The influence of the
   laser carrier-envelope phase on various channel (H + D+, D + H+, and H+
   + D+) probabilities is investigated at different laser field
   intensities. The carrier-envelope phase is found to govern the
   dissociation (H + D+ and D + H+) and Coulomb explosion (H+ + D+) channel
   probabilities. The kinetic energy release distributions of the fragments
   are also found to be sensitive to the carrierenvelope phase of the laser
   pulse. Our results are in agreement with the previously reported quantum
   dynamics studies and experiments.}},

Title = {{Occasional tillage in no-tillage systems: A global meta-analysis}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{745}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{No-tillage (NT) is a major component of conservation agricultural
   systems. Challenges that have arisen with the adoption of NT include
   soil compaction, weed management, and stratification of organic matter
   and nutrients. As an attempt to overcome these challenges, occasional
   tillage (OT) has been used as a soil management practice in NT systems.
   However, little is known about the impacts of OT on agronomic and
   environmental factors. For this reason, the objectives of this
   meta-analysis were: 1) to summarize the effects of OT on crop
   productivity, soil physical, chemical and biological properties, soil
   erosion and weed control; 2) to discuss the main aspects of NT
   management to optimize the use of OT; 3) to point out shortcomings in
   the diagnosis of soil compaction in NT systems, which may lead to
   erroneous decision-making processes regarding the use of OT. Overall, OT
   did not affect crops yields, although increased crop yields were
   observed in regions under water restriction and in soils with low
   retention capacity and water availability; OT improved soil physical
   properties (penetration resistance, soil bulk density, macroporosity,
   and total porosity), with persistence, generally, greater than 24
   months, and decreased the soil aggregates stability; total organic
   carbon was reduced, particularly when plow/harrow was used and NT was
   already consolidated, and there was no effect on pH and available P; OT
   increased microbial biomass carbon, but had no effect on total microbial
   activity; soil erosion was reduced due to increased soil-water
   infiltration and reduced runoff, and finally, weed management was also
   improved by OT. It is suggested that suitable NT implementation and
   management, with the correct application of NT principles, will overcome
   problems associated with NT. As soil compaction is the main
   justification for the use of OT, methods of diagnosis and monitoring of
   soil compaction should be improved to assist in decision-making. (C)

Title = {{A corner-clustering method for detection of slab management numbers
   sprayed on steel slabs}},
Journal = {{VISUAL COMPUTER}},
Abstract = {{To achieve manufacturing and logistics informatization management for
   steelworks, it is of crucial importance to automatically recognize the
   slab management numbers (SMNs) sprayed on the steel slabs. However, due
   to the poor quality of spraying and various interferences, SMN detection
   is a major challenge for subsequent recognition in the steel-slab
   product line. This paper proposes a corner-clustering method, which can
   extract the SMN from a changeable background precisely and promptly. In
   our method, the FAST algorithm is modified to extract the image corners
   by adaptively adjusting the local threshold of corner detecting with the
   change of image contrast. Then, the DBSCAN algorithm is implemented to
   group the corners into several clusters, which includes the SMN regions
   and interference regions. Finally, a classifier based on HOG features
   and SVM is applied to discriminate SMN and non-SMN regions. For
   experimental validation, the proposed method was implemented to a
   substantial amount of acquired images. A good performance has been
   achieved as the detection accuracy can reach as high as 98.96\% for SMN
   on the steel slabs.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we report on comparative studies of mechanical properties
   of diamond-like nanocomposite (DLN) a-C:H:Si:O films and titanium-doped
   DLN films, which were focused on (i) nanoindentation and internal stress
   examination of DLN films of different thickness (up to 10 mu m) and (ii)
   structural transformations and mechanical properties changes with
   increasing titanium content in Ti-DLN films. The DLN films were found to
   combine high hardness of 22-24 GPa, high elastic recovery, and low
   compressive stresses of 100-160 MPa. For Ti-DLN films, the hardness,
   elastic modulus, and residual stress were found to exhibit similar
   behavior vs Ti content: an initial decrease at low Ti contents was
   followed by gradual increase of the hardness, elastic modulus and
   compressive stresses. The mechanical properties changes were shown to
   correlate with the structure modifications induced by titanium
   incorporation into the DLN matrix. Raman spectra of Ti-DLN films
   revealed three peaks in the low-frequency region from 200 to 700 cm(-1),
   attributed to the TiC phase. An additional evidence of the formation of
   TiC nanocrystals of several nanometers size was obtained using
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of Ti-DLN films. The findings of
   Raman spectroscopy along with the TEM data have demonstrated the main
   factors formation of TiC nanocrystals and increase of the sp(2)-carbon
   content, responsible for the mechanical behavior of Ti-DLN films.}},

Title = {{Motor Skill Learning-Induced Functional Plasticity in the Primary
   Somatosensory Cortex: A Comparison Between Young and Older Adults}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{While in young adults (YAs) the underlying neural mechanisms of motor
   learning are well-studied, studies on the involvement of the
   somatosensory system during motor skill learning in older adults (OAs)
   remain sparse. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to
   investigate motor learning-induced neuroplasticity in the primary
   somatosensory cortex (S1) in YAs and OAs. Somatosensory evoked
   potentials (SEPs) were used to quantify somatosensory activation prior
   and immediately after motor skill learning in 20 right-handed healthy
   YAs (age range: 19-35 years) and OAs (age range: 57-76 years).
   Participants underwent a single session of a 30-min co-contraction task
   of the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and deltoid muscle. To assess the
   effect of motor learning, muscle onset asynchrony (MOA) between the
   onsets of the contractions of both muscles was measured using
   electromyography monitoring. In both groups, MOA shortened significantly
   during motor learning, with YAs showing bigger reductions. No changes
   were found in SEP amplitudes after motor learning in both groups.
   However, a correlation analysis revealed an association between baseline
   SEP amplitudes of the N20/P25 and N30 SEP component and the motor
   learning slope in YAs such that higher amplitudes are related to higher
   learning. Hence, the present findings suggest that SEP amplitudes might
   serve as a predictor of individual motor learning success, at least in
   YAs. Additionally, our results suggest that OAs are still capable of
   learning complex motor tasks, showing the importance of motor training
   in higher age to remain an active part of our society as a prevention
   for care dependency.}},

Abstract = {{Due to China's exposure and susceptibility to natural hazards, it is
   important for governments and aid agencies to have tools that enable
   effective post-disaster livelihood recovery in creating self-sufficiency
   for the affected population. This paper introduces a framework of
   critical components that constitute a successful livelihood recovery by
   studying the perceptions and perspectives of those affected by the 2013
   Lushan earthquake in Sichuan Province. A mixed method, namely a pilot
   study, questionnaire survey and interviews, was used. While the
   populations surveyed valued the employment benefits of creating new
   market and economic sectors in areas where rural farming was predominant
   prior to the earthquake, they considered that recovery of their housing
   was most essential for livelihood diversification. External assistance
   was also regarded highly in assisting with livelihood recovery, in which
   family ties and social connections seemed to have played a larger role
   than that of government agencies and NGOs. Lastly, the results
   highlighted that a goal of livelihood recovery cannot be achieved
   without individual well-being being considered, in relation to people's
   perceptions about quality of life and their physical and mental health.
   This paper aims to assist the Chinese policy makers and practitioners in
   disaster recovery in setting an agenda of preparing for livelihood
   recovery in peace times, or of post-disaster recovery planning should a
   disaster event occurs so that the economic impact and livelihood burdens
   of those affected can be effectively mitigated.}},

Abstract = {{All aspects of mRNA lifetime and function, including its stability,
   translation into protein, and trafficking through the cell, are tightly
   regulated through coordinated post-transcriptional modifications and
   interactions with a multitude of RNA effector proteins. Despite the
   increasing recognition of RNA regulation as a critical layer of
   mammalian gene expression control and its increasing excitement as a
   therapeutic target, tools to study and control RNA regulatory mechanisms
   with temporal precision in their endogenous environment are lacking.
   Here, we present small molecule-inducible RNA-targeting effectors based
   on our previously developed CRISPR/Cas-inspired RNA targeting system
   (CIRTS). The CIRTS biosensor platform is based on guide RNA
   (gRNA)-dependent RNA binding domains that interact with a target
   transcript using Watson-Crick-Franklin base pair interactions. Addition
   of a small molecule recruits an RNA effector to the target transcript,
   thereby eliciting a local effect on the transcript. In this work, we
   showcase that these CIRTS biosensors can trigger inducible RNA editing,
   degradation, or translation on target transcripts in a small
   molecule-dependent manner. We further go on to show that the CIRTS RNA
   base editor biosensor can induce RNA base editing in a small
   molecule-controllable manner in vivo. Collectively this work provides a
   new set of tools to probe the dynamics of RNA regulatory systems and
   control gene expression at the RNA level.}},

Abstract = {{Controlling the spatial organization of pi-conjugated molecules in soft
   systems is of importance for the design of new materials with
   application relevant optimized properties. Here, soft self-assembly of
   functional multi-chained pi-conjugated 5,5 `-diphenyl-2,2 `-bithiophenes
   is investigated. Focus is on molecules with a 3,5-disubstitution pattern
   at one end and no or only a single chain at the other end. By elongation
   of the single terminal chain, a transition from lamellar phases to
   helical networks is observed. With lowering the temperature, the
   lamellar phase types change from smectic via hexatic to crystalline. In
   some cases, different kinds of orders are combined in a single uniform
   lamellar structure. Moreover, a transition from uniform (synclinic) to
   alternating (anticlinic) tilt in adjacent layers is observed with
   decreasing chain length or rising temperature, due to a change of the
   molecular conformation from tuning fork like to Y-shaped. For compounds
   terminated with a long chain, helical self-assembly of the pi-conjugated
   rods in networks takes place, leading either to a racemic (Ia3 over bar
   d, gyroid) or a spontaneous mirror symmetry broken (I23) bicontinuous
   cubic phase and a chiral isotropic liquid phase (Iso(1)({[}){*}(])) as
   well. This work establishes rules for controlling the self-assembly of
   functional pi-conjugated rods in soft matter and fluids.}},

   challenges for achieving such a high level of per capita primary energy
   use are formidable, if not insurmountable. Development experience of Sri
   Lanka, and Kerala suggests that high level of human development is
   possible even at lower per capita energy use, if complemented by
   adequate public investment in health and education. With a per capita
   electricity use of 1500 kWh by 2030 and 2500 kWh by 2050, India can
   achieve significant improvement in human development from the present

Abstract = {{Plant peptide protease inhibitors are important molecules in seed
   storage metabolism and to fight insect pests. Commonly they contain
   multiple disulfide bonds and are exceptionally stable molecules. In this
   study, a novel peptide protease inhibitor from beetroot (Beta vulgaris)
   termed bevuTI-I was isolated, and its primary structure was determined
   via mass spectrometry-based amino acid sequencing. By sequence homology
   analysis a few peptides with high similarity to bevuTI-I, also known as
   the Mirabilis jalapa trypsin inhibitor subfamily of knottin-type
   protease inhibitors, were discovered. Hence, we assessed bevuTI-I for
   inhibitory activity toward trypsin (IC50 = 471 nM) and human prolyl
   oligopeptidase (IC50 = 11 mu M), which is an emerging drug target for
   neurodegenerative and inflammatory disorders. Interestingly, using a
   customized bioinformatics approach, bevuTI-I was found to be the missing
   link to annotate 243 novel sequences of M. jalapa trypsin inhibitor-like
   peptides. According to their phylogenetic distribution they appear to be
   common in several plant families. Therefore, the presented approach and
   our results may help to discover and classify other plant-derived
   cystine knot peptides, a class of plant molecules that play important
   functions in plant physiology and are currently being explored as lead
   molecules and scaffolds in drug development.}},

Title = {{Are evaluative cultures national or global? A cross-national study on
   evaluative cultures in academic recruitment processes in Europe}},
Journal = {{HIGHER EDUCATION}},
Abstract = {{Studies on academic recruitment processes have demonstrated that
   universities evaluate candidates for research positions using multiple
   criteria. However, most studies on preferences regarding evaluative
   criteria in recruitment processes focus on a single country, while
   cross-country studies are rare. Additionally, though studies have
   documented how fields evaluate candidates differently, those differences
   have not been deeply explored, thus creating a need for further inquiry.
   This paper aims to address this gap and investigates whether academics
   in two fields across five European countries prefer the same criteria to
   evaluate candidates for academic positions. The analysis is based on
   recent survey data drawn from academics in economics and physics in
   Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and the UK. Our results show
   that the academic fields have different evaluative cultures and that
   researchers from different fields prefer specific criteria when
   assessing candidates. We also found that these field-specific
   preferences were to some extent mediated through national frameworks
   such as funding systems.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CUTANEOUS PATHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{519-525}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background Traditionally, most cutaneous nevi show a gradient of HMB45
   (human melanoma black 45) and negative PRAME (preferentially expressed
   antigen in melanoma) immunostaining, while melanomas often show
   irregularly positive, diffusely positive or completely negative HMB45
   expression, and PRAME immunopositivity. However, we have occasionally
   observed benign halo nevi with loss of HMB45 gradient, raising
   diagnostic consideration for melanoma. The purpose of this study was to
   elucidate the expression pattern of HMB45 and PRAME in nevi with the
   halo phenomenon (NHP).
   Methods PRAME and HMB45 staining patterns in 20 cases of NHP and 16
   cases of conventional nevi were evaluated using light microscopy. An
   HMB45 gradient was defined as immunopositivity in only superficial
   melanocytes. HMB45 aberrant expression consisted of superficial and deep
   immunopositivity.
   Results Aberrant HMB45 expression was observed in 10 of 20 NHP (50\%). A
   gradient of HMB45 staining was seen in most conventional nevi, with only
   one showing focal weak expression in the deep dermis (6.3\%). All cases
   of NHP and conventional nevi showed essentially negative immunostaining
   by PRAME.
   Conclusion Aberrant HMB45 expression in NHP is not uncommon and may be a
   diagnostic pitfall. Negative PRAME immunostaining may be a reassuring
   finding to help differentiate halo nevus from malignant melanoma.}},

   Asia Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX)
   domain, using a perturbed physics ensemble (PPE) obtained by performing
   1-year simulations with different parameter values. The main goal is to
   characterize the parameter uncertainty of the model and to determine the
   most sensitive parameters for the region. Moreover, the presented
   experiments are used to study the effect of several parameters on the
   simulation of selected variables for subregions characterized by
   different climate conditions, assessing by which degree it is possible
   to improve model performance by properly selecting parameter inputs in
   each case. Finally, the paper explores the model parameter sensitivity
   over different domains, tackling the question of transferability of an
   RCM model setup to different regions of study.
   Results show that only a subset of model parameters present relevant
   changes in model performance for different parameter values.
   Importantly, for almost all parameter inputs, the model shows an
   opposite behaviour among different clusters and regions. This indicates
   that conducting a calibration of the model against observations to
   determine optimal parameter values for the Central Asia domain is
   particularly challenging: in this case, the use of objective calibration
   methods is highly necessary. Finally, the sensitivity of the model to
   parameter perturbation for Central Asia is different than the one
   observed for Europe, suggesting that an RCM should be retuned, and its
   parameter uncertainty properly investigated, when setting up model
   experiments for different domains of study.}},

Abstract = {{Cerium-based conversion coating formation is triggered by a local rise
   in pH at cathodic sites produced by the oxygen reduction reaction.
   Therefore, size, morphology distribution and electrochemical potential
   of those sites play a crucial role. While the deposition reaction is
   sensitive to both immersion bath concentrations and underlying substrate
   microstructure, only the former has been widely investigated. This
   research attempts to fill the gap by studying the effect of controlled
   microstructure variables like the cathodic intermetallics' geometry and
   spatial distribution on the conversion compound deposit initiation. A
   controlled cast Al alloy was synthesised for this study and consisted of
   distinct cathodic phases: Cu-rich intermetallics, Fe-rich intermetallics
   and Si particles. The localised deposition preferentially formed only on
   strong cathodic Cu-rich intermetallics. Size (surface area) of the
   Cu-rich intermetallic correlated linearly with the deposited area over
   it in terms of lateral and z-direction spread. The pH gradient occurring
   from the oxygen reduction near an IM is very local and does not affect
   pH gradients of a neighbouring IM. When immersion time is increased from
   0.5 h to 1 h, the percentage of Cu-rich IM covered with conversion
   coating increases. Big Cu-rich IM activate faster for deposition
   reaction than small Cu-rich IM.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past two decades, maternal mortality rates have declined around
   the world. In the United States, however, 700 women die each year as a
   result of pregnancy or delivery complications. This represents a 50\%
   increase in the U.S. maternal mortality rate over the same time period.
   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the
   pregnancy-related mortality ratios vary significantly by race, with
   White women experiencing 13.0 deaths per 100,000 births, compared with
   42.8 deaths per 100,000 births for Black women, from 2011 to 2015.
   Multiple studies suggest that implicit bias-defined as the attitudes or
   stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an
   unconscious manner-is most likely a contributing factor to this alarming
   racial health disparity. The failure to recognize the pain of African
   American patients, regardless of whether it is conscious or unconscious,
   has the potential to affect the way obstetrician/gynecologists counsel
   patients about treatment options when it comes to chronic conditions,
   contraception, vaginal birth after cesarean delivery, and the management
   of fibroids. In this article, we will review implicit bias and the
   impact it can have on health care and health disparities.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss the unconventional magnetic response and vortex states
   arising in noncentrosymmetric superconductors with chiral octahedral and
   tetrahedral (O or T) symmetry. We microscopically derive Ginzburg-Landau
   free energy. It is shown that due to spin-orbit and Zeeman coupling
   magnetic response of the system can change very significantly with
   temperature. For sufficiently strong coupling this leads to a crossover
   from type-1 superconductivity at elevated temperature to vortex states
   at lower temperature. The external magnetic field decay in such
   superconductors does not have the simple exponential law. We show that
   in the London limit, magnetic field can be solved in terms of complex
   force-free fields (W) over right arrow, which are defined by del x (W)
   over right arrow = const (W) over right arrow. Using that we demonstrate
   that the magnetic field of a vortex decays in spirals. Because of such
   behavior of the magnetic field, the intervortex and vortex-boundary
   interaction becomes nonmonotonic with multiple minima. This implies that
   vortices form bound states with other vortices, antivortices, and
   boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{The chemopreventive effects of beta-glucan-rich cereals such as oat and
   barley (beta (R) barley) have been examined previously, but studies
   comparing fermentation characteristics and chemopreventive effects of
   oat and barley of different processing stages are rare. Therefore, the
   present study aims at investigating the fermentation end points (pH
   values, concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and ammonia) in
   fermentation supernatants (FS) obtained from differently processed oat
   and barley samples (kernels, thick and thin flakes). Chemopreventive
   effects of FS, such as growth inhibition, apoptosis, and induction of
   cell cycle- and redox-relevant genes (p21, SOD2), were analysed in LT97
   colon adenoma cells. After fermentation, pH values were reduced (
   increment pH - 1.3, on average) and SCFA concentrations were increased (
   increment + 59 mmol/L, on average) with a shift towards butyrate
   formation in FS obtained from oat and barley samples compared to the
   fermentation negative control (FS blank). Ammonia was reduced more
   effectively in FS obtained from barley ( increment - 4.6 mmol/L, on
   average) than from oat samples ( increment - 1.0 mmol/L, on average).
   Treatment of LT97 cells with FS resulted in a time- and dose-dependent
   reduction of cell number, an increase in caspase-3 activity (up to
   9.0-fold after 24 h, on average) and an induction of p21 (2.1-fold, on
   average) and SOD2 (2.3-fold, on average) mRNA expression, while no
   genotoxic effects were observed. In general, the results indicate no
   concrete effect of the type of cereal or processing stage on
   fermentation and chemopreventive effects of oat and barley.}},

Abstract = {{Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water-splitting reaction becomes an important
   path for the requirement of the fulfillment of global energy demand. For
   PEC water-splitting reactions, here In2O3 is grown in situ in the
   nanopyramidal structure of In2S3 via a simple hydrothermal technique.
   The limited supply of S2- in the reaction medium plays an important role
   in the development of In2O3 along with In2S3, leading to the In2S3/In2O3
   nanocomposite. The In2S3/In2O3 nanocomposite shows an enriched carrier
   density compared to bare In2S3. The optimum amount of In2O3 in the
   composite helps to achieve efficient photoactivity. In addition, the
   observed negative shift of the flat band potential of the nanocomposite
   demonstrates the assistance of the early onset potential. Moreover, the
   In2S3/In2O3 nanocomposite shows improved visible light absorbance due to
   its pyramidal nanostructure. It can generate a high photoconversion
   efficiency of similar to 0.55\% at 0.77 V versus the reversible hydrogen
   electrode (RHE) in 0.5 M Na2SO4. The stability of the In2S3/In2O3
   nanopyramid is determined under chopped illumination condition for 1000
   s, which shows decay in the stability in the Na2SO4 medium. Importantly,
   to widen the applicability of the In2S3/In2O3 composite, the PEC
   water-splitting performance is determined in 3.5\% saline water. Under
   such a corrosive environment, In2S3/In2O3 can show efficient
   photoactivity as well as outstanding stability. It can generate a
   photocurrent density of 0.83 mA/cm(2) under an applied potential of 1.18
   V versus the RHE. The present research suggests the development of the
   In2S3/In2O3 nanopyramid composite as a chloride environment-withstanding
   and high corrosion-resistant photoanode. The advantage of the faceted
   nanopyramidal structure and the composite is focused here. It paves an
   avenue for the development and engineering of highly persistent
   seawater-splitting photoelectrodes, which provides an opportunity to use
   the vast seawater on the Earth as an energy carrier.}},

Abstract = {{Endosomal trafficking has emerged as a defective biological pathway in
   Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the pathway is a source of cerebrospinal
   fluid (CSF) protein accumulation. Nevertheless, the identity of the CSF
   proteins that accumulate in the setting of defects in AD's endosomal
   trafficking pathway remains unknown. Here, we performed a CSF proteomic
   screen in mice with a neuronal-selective knockout of the core of the
   retromer complex VPS35, a master conductor of endosomal traffic that has
   been implicated in AD. We then validated three of the most relevant
   proteomic findings: the amino terminus of the transmembrane proteins
   APLP1 and CHL1, and the mid-domain of tau, which is known to be
   unconventionally secreted and elevated in AD. In patients with AD
   dementia, the concentration of amino-terminal APLP1 and CHL1 in the CSF
   correlated with tau and phosphorylated tau. Similar results were
   observed in healthy controls, where both proteins correlated with tau
   and phosphorylated tau and were elevated in about 70\% of patients in
   the prodromal stages of AD. Collectively, the mouse-to-human studies
   suggest that retromer-dependent endosomal trafficking can regulate tau,
   APLP1, and CHL1 CSF concentration, informing on how AD's trafficking
   pathway might contribute to disease spread and how to identify its
   trafficking impairments in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Background Birth by caesarean section has been shown to alter the
   composition of the early infant gut microbiota and postulated to
   influence cognitive outcomes via the gut-brain axis.
   Aims To determine whether birth by caesarean section is associated with
   secondary school educational achievement.
   Methods Whole-population administrative data were used from anonymised
   individual level linkage of birth records to educational and health
   information from the New Zealand Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI).
   Participants were 111 843 children born between 1 January 1996 and 31
   December 1998 for whom mode of delivery information was available from
   International Classification of Diseases 9th edition codes in maternal
   records. The National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA) is
   the main secondary school qualification undertaken by New Zealand
   students. Multivariable linear regression models were used to examine
   the association between mode of delivery and educational achievement. A
   family fixed effect analysis compared educational achievement outcomes
   in sibling pairs where one sibling was delivered by caesarean section
   and one delivered vaginally.
   Results After adjustment for potential confounders, there was no
   significant association between mode of delivery and achievement of
   university entrance (odds ratio = 0.98, 95\% CI: 0.94-1.02). NCEA
   percentile scores were lower in caesarean born infants (Estimate =
   -0.37, 95\% CI: -0.69 to -0.06)). However, in the fixed effect sibling
   analysis caesarean section was no longer significantly associated with
   NCEA percentile scores.
   Conclusions We find that caesarean section is not related to educational
   outcomes, suggesting that even if the infant gut microbiota is altered
   in caesarean section, it does not appear to have a measurable impact on
   adolescent academic achievement.}},

Abstract = {{The programmed cell death-1/programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1)
   pathway is involved in preventing immune system-mediated destruction of
   malignant tumors including glioblastoma. However, the therapeutic
   influence of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition alone in glioblastoma is limited. To
   develop effective combination therapy involving PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition,
   we used a non-replicating virus-derived vector, hemagglutinating virus
   of Japan-envelope (HVJ-E), to inhibit tumor cell PD-L1 expression by
   delivering siRNA targeting PD-L1. HVJ-E is a promising vector for
   efficient delivery of enclosed substances to the target cells. Moreover,
   HVJ-E provokes robust antitumoral immunity by activating natural killer
   (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), and by suppressing
   regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg). We hypothesized that we could
   efficiently deliver PD-L1-inhibiting siRNAs to tumor cells using HVJ-E,
   and that synergistic activation of antitumoral immunity would occur due
   to the immunostimulating effects of HVJ-E and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition. We
   used artificially induced murine glioma stem-like cells, TS, to create
   mouse (C57BL/6N) glioblastoma models. Intratumoral injection of HVJ-E
   containing siRNA targeting PD-L1 (siPDL1/HVJ-E) suppressed the
   expression of tumor cell PD-L1 and significantly suppressed tumor growth
   in subcutaneous models and prolonged overall survival in brain tumor
   models. Flow cytometric analyses of brain tumor models showed that the
   proportions of brain-infiltrating CTL and NK cells were significantly
   increased after giving siPDL1/HVJ-E; in contrast, the rate of
   Treg/CD4(+) cells was significantly decreased in HVJ-E-treated tumors.
   CD8 depletion abrogated the therapeutic effect of siPDL1/HVJ-E,
   indicating that CD8(+) T lymphocytes mainly mediated this therapeutic
   effect. We believe that this non-replicating immunovirotherapy may be a
   novel therapeutic alternative to treat patients with glioblastoma.}},

Abstract = {{Background and aim
   Celiac disease is an immune-mediated disorder caused by sensitivity to
   dietary gluten. Celiac patients typically present with malabsorption and
   low growth parameters; however, studies have shown that the presentation
   of celiac disease can have a higher percentage of patients with normal
   or high growth parameters and no signs of malabsorption. The study aims
   to estimate the prevalence of the growth variation found in children
   with biopsy-confirmed celiac disease at the time of diagnosis.
   Methods
   We included 31 biopsy-confirmed pediatric celiac patients diagnosed from
   2007 to 2018 in King Abdulaziz Medical City, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.
   Patients' height, weight, and BMI at the time of diagnosis were
   converted to z-scores and growth percentiles according to the Centers
   for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts. In addition, patients'
   comorbid conditions were also recorded.
   Results
   At the time of diagnosis, 45.16\% of our patients presented as
   underweight, 41.94\% of patients had normal weight, 6.5\% were
   overweight and obese, respectively. The mean BMI was 15.44 (+/- 3.65).
   Our population had a statistically significant lower BMI, height, and
   weight mean z-scores at the time of diagnosis.
   Conclusion
   A significant number of children diagnosed with celiac disease in our
   center had low weight, height, and BMI at the time of diagnosis.
   However, we emphasize that having normal growth parameters does not rule
   out the diagnosis of celiac disease.}},

Abstract = {{Background Uric acid (UA) possesses antioxidant features and potential
   neuroprotective effects. However, conflicting results regarding the
   association between serum uric acid (SUA) levels and the prognosis of
   stroke have been obtained. We aimed to assess whether SUA is related to
   discharge recovery and short-term outcomes in patients who underwent
   thrombolysis therapy. Methods We recruited 393 consecutive patients who
   were diagnosed with acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) and treated with
   thrombolysis. The demographic information, including sex and age, was
   collected. Haematology tests, including SUA, fasting plasma glucose
   (FPG), and blood lipid parameters, were performed under fasting
   conditions the morning after admission. The modified Rankin Scale (mRS)
   was used to assess the functional outcome of patients at discharge and 3
   months after onset. Results A negative correlation was observed between
   the levels of SUA and the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale
   (NIHSS) score at discharge (r = - 0.171, P = 0.003). Additionally, a
   positive correlation was observed between the levels of SUA and the
   difference between the baseline NIHSS and discharge NIHSS (r = 0.118, P
   = 0.032). The levels of SUA in the patients with good outcomes (353.76
   +/- 93.05) were higher than those in the patients with poor outcomes
   (301.99 +/- 92.24; P = 0.015) at 3 months. The multivariate logistic
   regression analysis demonstrated that a higher SUA level (odds ratio
   0.988, 95\% confidence interval 0.985-0.991, P = 0.002) was an
   independent predictor of a good outcome at 3 months. Conclusion Higher
   SUA levels were associated with better discharge recovery and 3-month
   outcomes in patients with ischaemic stroke who received thrombolysis.}},

Abstract = {{Scope Peppermint is traditionally used as an antigalactagogue in
   breastfeeding women. However, the suppressive mechanism remains unclear.
   The authors investigate whether and how peppermint influences milk
   production at the cellular and molecular levels.
   Methods and Results A lactating mammary epithelial cell (MEC) culture
   model that produces major milk components is prepared. Peppermint oil
   (PMO) suppresses beta-casein production in conjunction with the induced
   enlargement of cytoplasmic lipid droplets (CLDs). PMO also significantly
   inactivates STAT5 and mTOR in the lactogenic signaling pathway. Menthol
   treatment, which is a primary PMO component, leads to decreases in
   beta-casein production, enlarged CLDs, the inactivated STAT5 and mTOR.
   Eucalyptol and menthyl acetate, other components of peppermint, does not
   show suppressive effects on lactating MECs. The inactivation of STAT5
   and mTOR upon menthol administration is also evident in alveolar MECs of
   lactating mice. Furthermore, lactating MECs expresses TRPM8 and TRPA1,
   which are menthol receptors known as cold receptors. Agonists of TRPM8
   and TRPA1 suppresses beta-casein production and inactivation of STAT5
   and mTOR in the lactating MECs.
   Conclusion These findings indicate that peppermint has potential as an
   antigalactagogue. Menthol is suggested to be an active compound in

Abstract = {{Conventional metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) gas sensors have been
   investigated for decades to protect our life and property. However, the
   traditional devices can hardly fulfill the requirements of our fast
   developing mobile society, because the high operating temperatures
   greatly limit their applications in battery-loaded portable systems that
   can only drive devices with low power consumption. As ammonia is gaining
   importance in the production and storage of hydrogen, there is an
   increasing demand for energy-efficient ammonia detectors. Hence, in this
   work, a Schottky diode resulting from the contact between zinc oxide
   nanorods and gold is designed to detect gaseous ammonia at room
   temperature with a power consumption of 625 mu W. The Schottky diode gas
   sensors benefit from the change of barrier height in different gases as
   well as the catalytic effect of gold nanoparticles. This diode
   structure, fabricated without expensive interdigitated electrodes and
   displaying excellent performance at room temperature, provides a novel
   method to equip mobile devices with MOS gas sensors.}},

   paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and was admitted to the cardiology

   rhythm. Significant prolongation of the QT interval (QTc = 640ms) was
   noted and an exceedingly prolonged (over 3 minutes), self-terminating,
   episode of ventricular flutter/fibrillation occurred during bedside
   monitoring. The event was terminated without first converting to a more
   organized ventricular rhythm and without any adverse neurological
   sequelae. Apart from the long duration of ventricular fibrillation and
   its spontaneous termination, our case highlights the importance of the
   continuous heart rhythm monitoring in patients with extreme QT interval

   the era of COVID-19}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{745}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{Use of antimicrobials in the treatment and prevention of COVID-19,
   caused by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is on the rise. The increased
   use of antimicrobials can have serious consequences on the environment.
   Antibiotics have had a reasonable role in bacterial co-infections with
   regards to the management of COVID-19. However, recent evidences suggest
   that there has been injudicious prescription of antimicrobials.
   Moreover, a large number of people are self-medicating with antibiotics
   in a misguided attempt to protect themselves from the virus. This
   practice is especially prevalent in developing communities. Although
   common soaps are effective at inactivating enveloped viruses, such as
   the SARS-CoV-2, use of antibacterial products bearing biocides has
   increased during this pandemic. Current wastewater treatment techniques
   are unable to offer complete elimination of antibacterial biocides.
   These compounds can then accumulate in different environmental
   compartments thus, disrupting the functioning of native microbes. These
   microbes are involved in the biogeochemical cycling of elements and
   environmental remediation. In addition, the presence of antimicrobial
   elements in the environment can stimulate antimicrobial resistance.
   Concrete actions are needed to address this issue. Development of an
   antimicrobial policy specific for COVID-19 is urgently needed.
   Investments into improving wastewater infrastructure as well as public
   awareness is crucial. Moreover, global monitoring programs and
   multidisciplinary collaborations are required to understand the
   environmental impact of this pandemics. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Background Patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) often have
   low magnesium, phosphate and zinc levels. Monitoring of serum
   concentrations and supplementation may be important, but there is no
   consensus on optimal practice. The objective of the WhyTrace survey was
   to describe current practice regarding the measurement and
   supplementation of magnesium, phosphate and zinc in ICUs.
   Methods A 54-item electronic questionnaire was developed in accordance
   with SURGE, SUrvey Reporting GuidelinE, to address international
   clinical practice in the ICU. National investigators recruited ICUs in
   ten countries with one physician responding per ICU using a unique
   e-mail distributed survey-link.
   Results The questionnaire was sent to clinicians in 336 ICUs of whom 283
   (84\%) responded. In 62\% of the ICUs, a standard procedure was in place
   regarding the measurement of serum magnesium levels, in 58\% for
   phosphate and in 9\% for zinc. Zinc was never or rarely measured in 64\%
   of ICUs. The frequency of requesting serum levels varied from twice
   daily to once weekly. Regarding supplementation, 66\% of ICUs had a
   standard procedure for magnesium, 63\% for phosphate and 15\% for zinc.
   Most procedures recommended supplementation when serum levels were below
   the lower reference level, but some used the upper reference levels as
   the threshold for supplementation and others decided on a case-by-case
   basis.
   Conclusion The practice of measuring and supplementing magnesium,
   phosphate and zinc differed substantially between ICUs. Our findings
   indicate that there is a need for high-quality prospective data on
   frequencies of measurements, treatment goals and effects of
   supplementation on patient-important outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional infection prevention and treatment methods include synthetic
   antibiotics, which can cause severe adverse side effects. Carvacrol and
   thymol are biologically active monoterpenoid extractants from oregano
   leaves with antibiotic capabilities; however, little is known regarding
   their effects on bone tissue engineering. The objective of this work is
   to understand their effects on osteogenesis, specifically with
   osteoblast and osteoclast cells, from surface-modified Ti6Al4V with
   plasma sprayed hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings. This system is an
   alternative to cemented implants to aid in bone healing. Results reveal
   that full carvacrol release from the HA matrix is successful in aqueous
   environments and modulation of release kinetics can also be made using
   polycaprolactone (PCL) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymers. From
   HA-pressed disc samples in physiological pH, full carvacrol release is
   achieved in 10 days using PCL/PEG, about 95\% release in 50 days using
   no polymer, and 60\% in 50 days when using a PCL coating. Without
   polymer, full carvacrol release is achieved after 3 days from HA
   coatings in both physiological pH and acidic pH, mimicking the
   post-surgery environment. The release is assessed as a diffusion-based
   mechanism in phosphate-buffered saline but degradation-based mechanism
   in acetate buffer solution. Carvacrol and thymol show bacterial
   inhibition of Staphylococcus epidermidis and no cytotoxic effects on
   osteoblast proliferation in vitro. Carvacrol and thymol also induce a
   significant 7\% reduction in osteoclast tartrate-resistant acid
   phosphatase (TRAP) activity, caused by poorly attached cellular
   morphologies, leading to an approximately 65\% reduction in osteoclast
   resorption pit formation. Our goal is to demonstrate a natural medicinal
   system that can support bone healing while providing infection
   prevention and reducing costly revision surgeries for orthopedic and
   dental applications.}},

Abstract = {{TiO2 has gained increasing interest because of its outstanding
   properties and promising applications in various fields. In this study,
   we report a novel MoO2/MoS2/TiO2 sandwich heterostructure that was
   prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) for highly efficient
   photocatalytic H-2 generation. The sandwich structure, consisting of a
   MoS2 nanoflake layer and a MoO2 nanoplate layer with large specific
   surface area, was grown on TiO2 nanotube array electrodes. The MoO2 acts
   as a fast hole transport layer that promotes efficient charge
   separation. Since the MoO2/MoS2/TiO2 heterostructure has a nearly
   fullsolar-spectrum absorption range, its photocatalytic activity for
   water splitting is enhanced, resulting in a H-2 production rate of 110
   mu mol h(-1) cm(-2). This work provides a bottom-up strategy for
   preparing highly efficient sandwich-type photocatalysts. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{Based on the traditional line-structured light measurement technology,
   we proposed a line-structured light imaging method of rail profile based
   on polarization fusion. First, the polarization component images and
   total intensity images of rail laser section at multiple angles were
   obtained by using a polarization camera. Furthermore, combining the
   correlation and complementarity of light strip information in the
   polarization component images and total intensity images, we constructed
   an image fusion algorithm based on the evaluation of light strip
   reliability, which improved the image quality of rail laser section. In
   addition, the experimental demonstration using the polished rails
   indicated that in the fused images of polarization component images and
   total intensity images, there was no longer local overexposure of light
   strip and the quality of light strip was improved. In comparison with
   the traditional method, the maximum measurement error of rail profile in
   the overexposed area was reduced from 0.31 mm to 0.10 mm, effectively
   improving the accuracy of rail profile detection.}},

Abstract = {{The G protein-coupled receptor 52 (GPR52) is an orphan receptor that is
   selectively expressed in the striatum and regulates various brain
   functions through activation of cAMP-dependent pathways. GPR52 has been
   identified as a promising therapeutic target for central nervous system
   disorders including schizophrenia and substance use disorders. Here, a
   series of novel GPR52 agonists were designed, synthesized, and evaluated
   based on compound 4. Several potent and efficacious GPR52 agonists (12c,
   23a, 23d, 23e, 23f, and 23h) were identified with nanomolar range
   potency based on a systematic structure-activity relationship
   exploration. Further studies of 12c indicate enhanced efficacy,
   excellent target selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties including
   good brain permeability. In vivo proof-of-concept investigations
   revealed that 12c displayed antipsychotic-like activity by significantly
   inhibiting amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotor behavior in mice.
   Collectively, our findings have resulted in an efficacious,
   brain-penetrant GPR52 agonist as a valuable pharmacological tool for
   investigating the physiological and therapeutic potential of GPR52
   activation.}},

Title = {{Phosphate removal by ZIF-8@MWCNT hybrids in presence of effluent organic
   matter: Adsorbent structure, wastewater quality, and DFT analysis}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{745}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{Recently, zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF8) and its derivatives
   have been applied in aqueous contaminant removal. Herein, three types of
   ZIF8@carbon nanotube (CNT) hybrids harvesting different pore structures
   and chemical bonding information are utilized for phosphate removal in
   the typical wastewater of activated sludge system (SW) and partial
   nitrification-denitrification treatment system (PND). Effluent organic
   matter (EfOM) is found to compete with phosphate for adsorption sites on
   adsorbents, resulting in reducing adsorptive capacities for phosphate,
   and the negative effect trend to become severer with increasing EfOM
   concentrations. Thus adverse impact arc highly to be relieved by using
   ZIF8@CNT-2 (hybrids with CNT dosage of 120 mg) with novel structure
   design, the hybrid of which harvests the highest phosphate removal of
   92.8-100\%, the largest Partition coefficient (PC) of 9119.05 mg g(-1)
   pM with initial concentration of 0.96 mg L-1 , pH independence in the
   range from 4 to 10. Analyses of the XPS characterization and
   first-principles calculations demonstrate the dominant interactions of
   Zn-O-P and H-bond during phosphate adsorption process by ZIF8@CNT
   hybrids. Such interactions are suppressed in presence of EfOM by
   weakening the above-stated binding energy at different adsorption sites
   according to first-principles simulation, resulting in declined
   phosphate adsorption capacity. In this regard, the less sensitivity to
   co-existing EfOM of ZIF8@CNT-2 may be due to the increased P-O, Zn-OP
   and P-OH and the strengthened tolerance of nanostructure. These results
   suggest the promising enhanced phosphate removal in presence of EfOM
   could be obtained by specifically designing adsorbent structure. (C)

Abstract = {{By employing Alkire and Foster (J Public Econ 95(7-8):476-487, 2011a)
   counting approach and Cerioli and Zani (A fuzzy approach to the
   measurement of poverty, Springer, Berlin, 1990) unequal weighting
   method, this study estimates the non-monetary multidimensional poverty
   in Ethiopia for three waves with fourteen country-specific indicators
   and four dimensions in its first part; and tried to identify the
   presence of state dependence with unobserved heterogeneity using dynamic
   random effect probit model with unobserved heterogeneity estimation
   technique in its second part. The data for the three waves are from
   Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) of Ethiopia for the year 2005, 2011
   and 2016. The panel estimation of non-monetary multidimensional poverty
   gives a higher level of multidimensional poverty compared to the reports
   from international organizations, mainly from OPHI and UNDP, in
   respective years. This is mainly due to the additional indicators and
   the weighting method used. Housing, cooking fuel, toilet and sanitation
   and electricity played a significant role compared with the other
   indicators for the high non-monetary multidimensional poverty in the
   country. It is also found that there is a substantial and positive
   impact of the previous poverty status of households for their future
   experience in poverty. Households living in rural areas are more prone
   to experience poverty and have low chance to exit from poverty compared
   to urban households. In addition to focus on infrastructure development
   in fighting poverty, the governments' development policies and
   strategies should target households who are experiencing poverty trap
   mainly those who are living in rural areas.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, sialon/SiC composite ceramics were synthesized in situ
   from SiC, alpha-Si3N4, AlN, calcined bauxite, quartz, and Y2O3 via
   layered buried sintering at different temperatures (1540-1640 degrees
   C). The sialon/SiC composite ceramics designed in this study are
   expected to be used as thermal absorb materials in solar thermal power
   generation based on the good mechanical character and thermal shock
   resistance. The results showed that the beta-sialon/SiC sample with 60
   wt\% silicon carbide sintered at 1600 degrees C exhibited the optimal
   performances with dense microstructure, high bending strength, and good
   thermal shock resistance. After 30 thermal shock cycles, the bending
   strength of beta-sialon/SiC sample with 60 wt\% silicon carbide was
   66.68 MPa with a decrease of 4.79\%. In thermal shock tests, SiC and
   Si3N4 in the sample were oxidized into amorphous SiO2, and small amount
   of sialon was decomposed into mullite, which resulted in good thermal
   shock resistance. It was believed that in situ sialon/SiC composite
   ceramics can be a promising candidate for solar absorber owing to good
   thermal shock resistance.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{The intrinsic spin Hall effect plays an important role in spintronics
   applications, such as spin-orbit torque-based memory. The bulk space
   group symmetry determines the form of the bulk spin current conductivity
   tensor. This paper considers materials for which the local point group
   symmetry of individual atoms is lower than the global (bulk) symmetry.
   This enables a position-dependent spin current response, with additional
   tensor components allowed relative to the bulk response. We present a
   general method to compute the position-dependent intrinsic spin Hall
   conductivity, with similar computational effort relative to computing
   the bulk spin Hall conductivity. We also present the general
   symmetry-constrained form of the position-dependent spin current
   response. We apply this method to 1T'-WTe2, which exhibits a
   conventional spin Hall conductivity tensor component sigma(y)(xz) and a
   staggered unconventional component sigma(z)(xz). The magnitude of these
   two components, around 100 and 20 (Omega cm)(-1), respectively, are
   comparable to the spin-orbit torque exerted on adjacent ferromagnets in
   experiments. We then consider orthorhombic PbTe, in which both uniform
   and staggered spin current conductivity are one order of magnitude
   larger.}},

Title = {{Confined growth of ultrafine Mo2C nanoparticles embedded in N-doped
   carbon nanosheet for water splitting}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{842}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{Because of low-cost, marvelous activity and excellent stability
   characteristics, nonprecious metal carbide-based catalysts are promising
   candidates for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, inferior
   specific surface area and undesirable catalytic activity of pure phase
   carbides greatly impedes their industrialization process. Herein,
   ultrafine Mo2C nanoparticles embedded in N-doped carbon nanosheet has
   been synthesized by a facile strategy. High viscosity of guar gum
   alleviates the aggregation of nanocrystals by providing
   space-confinement effect; besides, NaCl plays two roles: (1) hard
   template directing the formation of carbon nanosheet; (2) molten salt
   adjusting the nucleation and growth process of Mo2C to ensure the
   formation of ultra-small Mo2C nanoparticles. Two-dimensional sheet-like
   carbon accelerates the electron transfer, and rich heterojunction
   between ultrafine Mo2C and N-doped carbon facilitates boosting the HER
   catalytic activity. The prepared Mo2C/NCS with optimized composition
   exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability both in acidic
   (189 mV at a current density of 10 mV/cm(2) with a Tafel slope of 61.2
   mV/dec) and alkaline medium (142 mV at a current density of 10 mV/cm(2)
   with a Tafel slope of 56.1 mV/dec). This work may provide insight for
   developing economic and high-efficient catalysts for water splitting.

Abstract = {{Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum) is rich in flavonols, which are
   thought to be highly beneficial for human health. However, little is
   known about the regulatory mechanism of flavonol biosynthesis in Tartary
   buckwheat. In this study, we identified and characterized a novel SG7
   R2R3-MYB transcription factor in Tartary buckwheat, FtMYB6. We showed
   that FtMYB6 is located in the nucleus and acts as a transcriptional
   activator. The FtMYB6 promoter showed strong spatiotemporal specificity
   and was induced by light. The expression of FtMYB6 showed a significant
   correlation with rutin accumulation in the roots, stems, leaves, and
   flowers. Overexpression of FtMYB6 in transgenic Tartary buckwheat hairy
   roots and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants significantly increased the
   accumulation of flavonols. In transient luciferase (LUC) activity assay,
   FtMYB6 promoted the activity of FtF3H and FtFLS1 promoters and inhibited
   the activity of the Ft4CL promoter. Collectively, our results suggest
   that FtMYB6 promotes flavonol biosynthesis by activating FtF3H and
   FtFLS1 expression.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Meniscus tear is one of the most familiar orthopedic injury,
   and it is also the leading cause of the dysfunction of knee joint.
   Recent efforts to improve the success rate of the meniscus repair
   surgery involve the addition of platelet-rich plasma (PRP). The aim of
   our experiment is to assess the clinical effects of arthroscopic repair
   of meniscal tears without or with PRP.
   Methods: This is a randomized and parallel-group superiority study. The
   study protocol is approved through the review committee of the
   corresponding institutions in PLA Army 80th Group Military Hospital. All
   patients will provide written informed consent to participate in the
   study. We implement our investigation on the basis of the ethical
   standards outlined in the Helsinki Declaration of 1964 and then report
   our outcomes according to the CONSORT statement of 2010. All the
   patients follow a same rehabilitation program. Patients are assessed at
   baseline (day before operation), 12 months and 24 months after the last
   time of injection; outcome assessments involve Ikeuchi score, Lysholm
   score, and the visual analogue scales for failure and pain rate. P value
   less than .05 indicates that there is statistical significance.
   Results: We suppose that arthroscopic PRP repair of meniscus tears
   results in improved pain and functional results owing to the release of
   bioactive molecules that may affect the healing of meniscus.}},

Abstract = {{The bonding of thermal-sprayed coatings largely depends on the substrate
   surface morphology. This study examines the effect of the substrate
   surface texture shapes on the adhesion strength of coatings. For that,
   it used plasma-sprayed Ni-based MoS2 coatings deposited on grit-blasted
   and laser-textured surfaces, and investigated the coating bonding
   strength (ASTM 633 pull-off test), and cross-sectional and fracture
   morphologies, as well as phase compositions and element distribution.
   The results showed that the surface texture shape has a significant
   effect on the improvement of coating adhesion. The coatings deposited on
   sinusoidal-textured surfaces had the highest adhesion strength (50.0
   MPa), followed by coatings deposited on groove-textured surfaces, while
   dimple and dimple-groove textures resulted in the lowest coating
   adhesion strength. The coating fracture analysis revealed that cohesive
   failure occurred mainly at the texture positions, while adhesive failure
   occurred almost always in plain areas. Therefore, it could be concluded
   that, in the conditions of this study, the existence of plain areas and
   dimple textures did not improve coating adhesion. Factors such as
   coating bond mode, contact area ratio, and coating deposition quality
   should be comprehensively considered in texture design to improve
   coating adhesion.}},

Abstract = {{This study proposes a diagnosis method for open-circuit faults of
   six-phase permanent magnet synchronous motor. When the open-circuit
   fault occurs in the single-bridge arm or the double-bridge arm, wavelet
   transform extracts the trigger signal of fault, and the z(1)-z(2) plane
   current component is analysed. Seven kinds of fault modes are defined by
   analysing the characteristics of the scatter plot of the z(1)-z(2) plane
   current component. The fractal dimension of the z(1)-z(2) plane current
   component scatter plot is calculated to accurately quantify the fault
   modes. Moreover, 13 fault areas are defined by analysing the current
   centroid position of the z(1)-z(2) plane current component. First, the
   diagnosis of two particular kinds of fault modes is completed by
   selecting the fault area. Besides, the diagnosis of the remaining five
   kinds of fault modes is completed by combining the fault area and the
   fault mode. The conditions for judging all open-circuit faults are
   summarised to establish a fault database. All the open faults can be
   diagnosed by searching the fault database by the proposed method.
   Finally, the effectiveness of the method is verified by experiments.}},

Abstract = {{This article investigates an adaptive neural network (NN) control
   algorithm for marine surface vessels with time-varying output
   constraints and unknown external disturbances. The nonlinear
   state-dependent transformation (NSDT) is introduced to eliminate the
   feasibility conditions of virtual controller. Moreover, the barrier
   Lyapunov function (BLF) is used to achieve time-varying output
   constraints. As an important approximation tool, the NN is employed to
   approximate uncertain and continuous functions. Subsequently, the
   disturbance observer is structured to observe time-varying constraints
   and unknown external disturbances. The novel strategy can guarantee that
   all signals in the closed-loop system are semiglobally uniformly
   ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Finally, the simulation results verify the

Title = {{Investigation and Prediction of Abrasive Wear Rate of Heat-Treated HCCIs
   with Different Cr/C Ratios Using Artificial Neural Networks}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF METALCASTING}},
Abstract = {{In this study, artificial neural networks (ANNs) technique was used in
   the prediction of abrasive wear rate of high-Cr white cast irons (HCCIs)
   after subcritical heat treatment at different temperatures. High Cr WCI
   alloys with different compositions were tested at sliding speed of 1.04
   m s(-1) under the normal load of 30 N and different sliding distances of
   500, 1000 and 1500 m. The abrasive wear rates obtained from wear tests
   were used in the formation of the data sets of the ANN. A multilayer
   perceptron model has been constructed with back-propagation algorithm
   using the input parameters of load, tempering temperature, and Cr/C
   ratio. The output parameter of the model is abrasive wear rate.
   Experimental results showed that abrasive wear rate of high-Cr WCI was
   significantly increased with the increasing of Cr/C ratio. High-Cr WCI
   alloys with higher volume fraction of carbides and structures with
   martensitic matrix at lower Cr/C ratio exhibited lower abrasive weight
   losses. The increasing of both sliding distance and load increases the
   abrasive weight losses. The HCCI-2 alloy exhibited the lower abrasive
   weight losses as compared with the other alloys in both as-cast and
   heat-treated conditions. In addition, the abrasive weight losses for all
   investigated alloys with different Cr/C ratios after destabilization
   heat treatment are lower than alloys in the as-cast state. This is may
   be due to the presences of stronger martensitic matrix structure rather
   than austenitic or pearlitic matrix structures. Correlation coefficients
   between the experimental data and outputs from the ANN established the
   feasibility of ANNs to effectively model and predict the wear rate of
   high Cr WCI. From the sensitivity analysis, it is concluded that the
   tempering temperature had the most influence on the wear rate, while the
   applied load and Cr/C ratio had a small influence on the wear rate of
   high-Cr WCI.}},

Abstract = {{In the current proposed analysis, a new, feasible, and selective
   fluorimetric approach was designed for baclofen assay. Baclofen is a
   medication prescribed as a therapy for muscle spasticity that originated
   from multiple sclerosis or a spinal cord injury, and other cases such as
   hiccups. The analytical approach relies on the use of ninhydrin to form
   a fluorescent derivative that was monitored at lambda(ex) 386 nm or
   lambda(em) 480 nm. Under suitable reaction conditions, the primary amino
   moiety in baclofen was condensed with ninhydrin and phenylacetaldehyde
   in the presence of Teorel buffer as a buffered medium. The method
   exhibited linearity when baclofen concentration was plotted against
   response in the range 1-10 mu g ml(-1). Adjustment of the reaction
   variables and study of validation parameters according to ICH directives
   were performed correctly. An interference study was implemented to
   ensure that no discrepancy from the excipient had occurred. Finally, the
   proposed method was applied successfully for baclofen assay in dosage
   form and extended to test Mylobac content uniformity.}},

Title = {{How inclusive leadership paves way for psychological well-being of
   employees during trauma and crisis: A three-wave longitudinal mediation
   study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{77}},

Pages = {{819-831}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Aims Nurses are at the forefront of public health emergencies facing
   psychological pressures ensuing from the loss of patients and potential
   risk of infection while treating the infected. This study examines
   whether inclusive leadership has a causal relationship with
   psychological distress and to assess the mediation effect of
   psychological safety on this relationship in the long run. The
   hypotheses are developed and interpreted with the help of theoretical
   underpinnings from job demands resources theory and the theory of
   shattered assumptions.
   Design Three-wave longitudinal study.
   Methods Questionnaire was used to carry out three waves of data
   collection from 405 nurses employed at five hospitals in Wuhan during
   the COVID-19 outbreak between the months of January-April 2020. Partial
   least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyze
   data while controlling for age, gender, education, experience, and
   working hours.
   Results Results supported the hypothesized relationships where inclusive
   leadership indicated significant inverse causal relationship with
   psychological distress and a positive causal relationship with
   psychological safety. Mediation effect of psychological safety was found
   significant, while the model explained 73.9\% variance in psychological
   distress.
   Conclusion Inclusive leadership, through its positive and supportive
   characteristics, can pave way for such mechanisms that improve the
   psychological safety of employees in the long run and curbs
   psychological distress.
   Impact This is the first longitudinal study to examine the relationship
   between inclusive leadership and psychological distress in health care
   and also examines the mediating mechanism of psychology safety. There is
   scarcity of empirical research on factors that determine and affect
   behavioural mechanism of healthcare workers during traumatic events and
   crisis. Clinical leaders and healthcare policy makers must invest in and
   promote inclusive and supportive environment characterized with open and
   accessible leaders at workplace to improve psychological safety; it
   helps reduce levels of psychological distress.}},

Abstract = {{Maximizing the current organizational culture and diversity/inclusion
   practices within CUNY libraries is crucial to retaining highly talented
   support staff with significant potential for future leadership roles.
   This research explores equity, diversity, and inclusion within the
   library profession, with the intention of implementing strategic
   frameworks to attract, recruit, and retain underrepresented groups
   within the University. To spotlight areas of upward mobility within CUNY
   academic libraries, a CUNY-wide Library Workplace Climate survey on the
   perceptions of diversity, universal inclusion, and career progression
   was conducted. The scope of the survey study compares the different
   perspectives of CUNY librarians, full-time library classified
   paraprofessionals, and part-time classified staff to measure CUNY's
   commitment to addressing the diversity gap in the library profession.
   CUNY-wide, 141 library employees participated in a survey study to
   uncover professional development opportunities in support of career
   advancement and upward mobility. Nearly 2 in 5 African American/Black
   library staff-members are paraprofessionals, while 13.5\% are faculty. A
   stark contrast to 3 in 5 or 64\% CUNY library faculty, which identified
   as White/Caucasian. The findings reinforce the need for measures to
   maximize workplace diversity through support-staff mentoring, guidance,
   and recruitment. Workplace mentorship and career development-across all
   levels within CUNY libraries-cultivate skills for a better work
   environment that can lead to promotion and successful plans for
   succession. Investing and sustaining structured library professional
   development opportunities geared toward underrepresented
   groups-generally in paraprofessional and student-worker roles-will help
   identify next generation CUNY library leadership.}},

Abstract = {{Many animals, and an increasing number of artificial agents, display
   sophisticated capabilities to perceive and manipulate objects. But human
   beings remain distinctive in their capacity for flexible, creative tool
   use-using objects in new ways to act on the world, achieve a goal, or
   solve a problem. To study this type of general physical problem solving,
   we introduce the Virtual Tools game. In this game, people solve a large
   range of challenging physical puzzles in just a handful of attempts. We
   propose that the flexibility of human physical problem solving rests on
   an ability to imagine the effects of hypothesized actions, while the
   efficiency of human search arises from rich action priors which are
   updated via observations of the world. We instantiate these components
   in the ``sample, simulate, update{''} (SSUP) model and show that it
   captures human performance across 30 levels of the Virtual Tools game.
   More broadly, this model provides a mechanism for explaining how people
   condense general physical knowledge into actionable, task-specific plans
   to achieve flexible and efficient physical problem solving.}},

Abstract = {{Although the macroinvertebrates have been widely used as bio-indicator
   for river water quality assessment in developed countries, its
   application is new in Iran and data on the health status of the most
   ecologically important rivers in Iran is scarce. The present study aimed
   at monitoring and assessing the ecological quality of Aghlagan river,
   northwest of Iran, using integrated physicochemical-biological
   approaches. A total of 14,423 samplings were carried out from the
   headwater to downstream sites at four stations (S1, 2, 3, 4) by a Surber
   sampler (30 cm x 30 cm) from June 2018 to April 2019. The results
   obtained from macroinvertebrate biotic index revealed that the genera of
   Gammarus (Amphipoda) and Baetis (Ephemeroptera) were the most abundant
   in all seasons. The PAST software was applied to analyze the diversity
   indices (Shannon-Weiner diversity, Evenness, and Simpson indices). Based
   on the cluster analysis, S3 established the least similarity to other
   stations. The average frequency of each macroinvertebrate species was
   determined by one-factor analysis of similarities (ANOSIM). In
   accordance with canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), temperature and
   phosphate were found as the dominant factors effecting the
   macroinvertebrate assemblage and distribution. Moreover, the results
   obtained from the biological indices concluded very good quality of S4
   by Helsinhoff and EPT indices and fair quality using BMWP index. The
   data on the macrobenthos assemblage and dynamics in the Aghlagan river
   across a hydraulic gradient provided useful information on water
   management efforts that assist us to find sustainable solutions for the
   enhanced quality of the river by balancing environmental and human
   values.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Cholesterol and triglycerides are among the most well-known
   risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
   OBJECTIVES This study investigated whether higher low-density
   lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglyceride levels and lower
   high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level are causal risk factors for
   changes in prognostically important left ventricular (LV) parameters.
   METHODS One-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) of 17,311 European
   individuals from the UK Biobank with paired lipid and cardiovascular
   magnetic resonance data was performed. Two-sample MR was performed by
   using summary-level data from the Global Lipid Genetics Consortium (n =
   188,577) and UK Biobank Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance substudy (n =
   16,923) for sensitivity analyses.
   RESULTS In 1-sample MR analysis, higher LDL cholesterol was causally
   associated with higher LV end-diastolic volume (beta = 1.85 ml; 95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI]: 0.59 to 3.14 ml; p = 0.004) and higher LV
   mass (beta = 0.81 g; 95\% CI: 0.11 to 1.51 g; p = 0.023) and
   triglycerides with higher LV mass (beta = 1.37 g; 95\% CI: 0.45 to 2.3
   g; p = 0.004). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol had no significant
   association with any LV parameter. Similar results were obtained by
   using 2-sample MR. Observational analyses were frequently discordant
   with those derived from MR.
   CONCLUSIONS MR analysis demonstrates that LDL cholesterol and

Title = {{Estimated SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence in the US as of September 2020}},

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Case-based surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome
   coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection likely underestimates the true
   prevalence of infections. Large-scale seroprevalence surveys can better
   estimate infection across many geographic regions.
   OBJECTIVE To estimate the prevalence of persons with SARS-CoV-2
   antibodies using residual sera from commercial laboratories across the
   US and assess changes over time.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This repeated, cross-sectional study
   conducted across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto
   Rico used a convenience sample of residual serum specimens provided by
   persons of all ages that were originally submitted for routine screening
   or clinical management from 2 private clinical commercial laboratories.
   Samples were obtained during 4 collection periods: July 27 to August 13,
   August 10 to August 27, August 24 to September 10, and September 7 to
   September 24, 2020.
   EXPOSURES Infection with SARS-CoV-2.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The proportion of persons previously infected
   with SARS-CoV-2 as measured by the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2
   by 1 of 3 chemiluminescent immunoassays. Iterative poststratification
   was used to adjust seroprevalence estimates to the demographic profile
   and urbanicity of each jurisdiction. Seroprevalence was estimated by
   jurisdiction, sex, age group (0-17, 18-49, 50-64, and >= 65 years), and
   metropolitan/nonmetropolitan status.
   RESULTS Of 177 919 serum samples tested, 103 771 (58.3\%) were from
   women, 26 716 (15.0\%) from persons 17 years or younger, 47 513 (26.7\%)
   from persons 65 years or older, and 26 290 (14.8\%) from individuals
   living in nonmetropolitan areas. Jurisdiction-level seroprevalence over
   4 collection periods ranged from less than 1\% to 23\%. In 42 of 49
   jurisdictions with sufficient samples to estimate seroprevalence across
   all periods, fewer than 10\% of people had detectable SARS-CoV-2
   antibodies. Seroprevalence estimates varied between sexes, across age
   groups, and between metropolitan/nonmetropolitan areas. Changes from
   period 1 to 4 were less than 7 percentage points in all jurisdictions
   and varied across sites.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This cross-sectional study found that as of
   September 2020, most persons in the US did not have serologic evidence
   of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, although prevalence varied widely by
   jurisdiction. Biweekly nationwide testing of commercial clinical
   laboratory sera can play an important role in helping track the spread
   of SARS-CoV-2 in the US.}},

Title = {{Nonstationary force sensing under dissipative mechanical quantum
   squeezing}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{We study the stationary and nonstationary measurement of a classical
   force driving a mechanical oscillator coupled to an electromagnetic
   cavity under two-tone driving. For this purpose, we develop a
   theoretical framework based on the signal-to-noise ratio to quantify the
   sensitivity of linear spectral measurements. Then we consider stationary
   force sensing and study the necessary conditions to minimize the added
   force noise. We find that imprecision noise and back-action noise can be
   arbitrarily suppressed by manipulating the amplitudes of the input
   coherent fields; however, the force noise power spectral density cannot
   be reduced below the level of thermal fluctuations. Therefore, we
   consider a nonstationary protocol that involves nonthermal dissipative
   state preparation followed by a finite time measurement, which allows
   one to perform measurements with a signal-to-noise ratio much greater
   than the maximum possible in a stationary measurement scenario. We
   analyze two different measurement schemes in the nonstationary transient
   regime: a back-action-evading measurement, which implies modifying the
   drive asymmetry configuration upon arrival of the force, and a
   nonstationary measurement that leaves the drive asymmetry configuration
   unchanged. Conditions for optimal force noise sensitivity are
   determined, and the corresponding force noise power spectral densities
   are calculated.}},

Title = {{Developing and Testing the Populi Needle Exchange Point Finder: An App
   to Reduce Harm Associated With Intravenous Drug Consumption Among
   Homeless and Non-homeless Drug Users}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{The spread of viral infections remains a serious public health problem.
   People who inject drugs represent one of the highest-risk groups.
   eHealth and mHealth have been shown to be effective in improving
   individuals' management of their own health and their access to health
   care and to contribute to reducing the costs associated with certain
   medical interventions. People who inject drugs, including homeless
   people, tend to have access to technology. Young homeless people in
   particular are likely to use smartphones and social networking sites in
   ways that are similar to the general population. Despite this widespread
   use of technology, there are no apps designed specifically to reduce
   harm in people who inject drugs. The objective of this study is to
   analyze the development and usability testing process for an application
   for mobile devices, designed to complement the Needle Exchange Program.
   This app-the first of its kind-was developed by a public health agency,
   specialized professionals and people who inject drugs. We analyzed the
   differences in how health providers and drug users experienced the
   usability of the app. The participants were 61 members of
   multidisciplinary professional group and 16 people who inject drugs. We
   used a cross-sectional quantitative, observational design. First, we
   created and administered a questionnaire to collect the sociodemographic
   characteristics that could mediate the use of technology. Next
   participants tried the app and filled out a second questionnaire in
   which they rated their experience on a Likert scale from 1 to 7 in the
   following dimensions: overall attractiveness of the app, ease/difficulty
   of use, the extent to which they believed the app could improve access
   to injection materials, the extent to which they thought it would
   improve PWID's participation in the needle exchange program, overall
   utility, the degree to which they thought PWID would use the app, and
   the need for the app. To analyze the answers, we used contingency tables
   and compared means using a Student's t test. Finally, we conducted six
   audio-recorded focus groups about how the participants experienced the
   usability of the app. The objective of this part of the study was to
   classify and quantify the contributions of individuals and the group
   according to three predefined categories: potential benefits and
   positive aspects, potential obstacles or difficulties in carrying out
   the project, and concrete suggestions for improving the interface. There
   were not significant differences between the sociodemographic variables
   and the variables related to use of the app between professionals and
   PWID. Both professionals and PWID rated the app as intuitive and useful,
   especially the geolocation function for NEPs. Both groups also thought
   that the interface contained too much information and that this excess
   could be confusing for users. Both groups also had similar opinions
   about the app and its uses. An important difference between the two
   groups is that PWID reported that they would use the app, while
   professionals reported that they didn't think PWID would use it. All
   participants proposed improvements on the prototype, suggestions that
   will be applied in the creation of the definitive interface. Including
   professionals and patients in this sort of usability test enables
   researchers and developers to detect the needs of potential app users.}},

Abstract = {{Flexible all-solid-state supercapacitors have drawn more attention owing
   to the rapid growth of wearable electronic equipments. Herein, we have
   succeeded in synthesizing a series of Y-doped lanthanum titanate
   flexible self-supporting films (LSF-x, 0.1 <= x <= 0.5) and
   investigating the change of microstructures, morphological
   characteristics, and lattice structures of these films affected by
   different Y-doping contents. To further determine the optimum Y-doping
   content, we have explored the electrochemical properties of working
   electrodes prepared by LSF-x (0.1 <= x <= 0.5) samples as the main
   active material. As the LSF-0.2 electrode has the best areal capacitance
   of 1.3 F.cm(-2) at 2 mA.cm(-2), we use the LSF-0.2 electrodes and
   PVA-Na2SO4 gel to fabricate a flexible all-solid-state supercapacitor
   device. This device has a high areal capacitance of 255.9 mF.cm(-2) at a
   current density of 2 mA.cm(-2) with a high cell voltage of 2.1 V, while
   the corresponding energy density is 156.8 mu Wh.cm(-2 )with a power
   density of 2.1 mW/.cm(-2). Moreover, it also shows a long cycling life
   and outstanding flexibility. Therefore, the LSF-0.2 sample can be used
   as an excellent energy-storage material for a wearable electronic
   device.}},

Abstract = {{Exploring a large-scale case-level dataset from Brazilian federal
   courts, we offer empirical insight into the implications of the
   organizational structure and jurisdictional specialization of in-court
   adjudication forums for case duration, a measure of tribunal efficacy.
   Federal trial courts in Brazil are organized into offices, with each
   office further divided into a titled and a substitute judgeship. Random
   case assignment between judgeships within the offices and between
   same-jurisdiction offices within the courts facilitates the estimation
   of causal effects of different adjudicatory forums on case duration.
   Titled judgeships on average exhibit a modest efficacy advantage over
   substitute judgeships, although substitute judgeships are more
   efficacious than titled judgeships in some of the court offices. Case
   duration differences between same-jurisdiction offices can be
   considerable, an indication of inequities in recourse to justice.
   Estimates exploiting variation in court offices' jurisdictional
   specialization suggest that office specialization reduces case duration
   only if offices are either specialized with respect to procedure or
   fully specialized with respect to issue, or both. Partial specialization
   in issue does not exhibit an effect on case duration. Because
   specialization of in-court adjudication forums is a common
   organizational feature of many justice systems worldwide, our findings
   are relevant beyond Brazilian borders.}},

Abstract = {{Specific cytotoxicity for catalytic nanomedicine triggered by the tumor
   microenvironment (TME) has attracted increasing interest. In this work,
   we prepared AgBiS2 hollow nanospheres with narrow bandgaps via rapid
   precipitation in a weakly polar solvent, which lowered the intrinsic
   energy gap for the active production of highly reactive hydroxyl
   radicals ((OH)-O-center dot), especially in the TME. The as-prepared
   AgBiS2 hollow nanospheres exhibited enhanced optical absorption and high
   photothermal conversion efficiency (44.2\%). In addition, the hollow
   structured AgBiS2 nanospheres were found to have a peroxidase-mimicking
   feature to induce cancer cell-specific cytotoxicity while exhibiting
   negligible cytotoxicity toward normal cells, which might be attributed
   to the efficient production of highly reactive (OH)-O-center dot
   originating from the overexpression H2O2 in the TME caused by surface
   catalysis. In particular, the cancer cell-specific cytotoxicity of the
   nanospheres was greatly enhanced both in vitro and in vivo upon
   irradiation with a near-infrared (NIR) laser (808 nm). The
   above-mentioned features of the hollow structured AgBiS2 will make it a
   promising candidate for tumor therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant genetic
   disease characterized by high levels of low-density
   lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDLc), associated to premature cardiovascular
   disease. The detection of the variants related to FH is important to
   improve the early diagnosis in probands / index-cases (ICs) and their
   relatives. We included ICs with FH and their relatives, living in a
   small region of Minas Gerais state-Brazil, which were classified
   according to Dutch Lipid Clinic Network Criteria (DLCNC) and submitted
   to sequencing of genes related to FH (LDLR, APOB, PCSK9, LDLRAP1, LIPA,
   STAP1, APOE, ABCG5 e ABCG8). In a total of 143 subjects (32 ICs and 111
   relatives), eight variants were identified in 91 individuals. From these
   variants, five were in LDLR {[}p.(Asp224Asn), p.(Ser854Gly),
   p.(Cys34Arg), p.(Asp601His), deletion of exon15 in LDLR)], one in APOB
   {[}p.(Met499Val)], one in PCSK9 {[}p.(Arg237Trp)] and one in APOE
   {[}p.(Pro28Leu)] genes. The variants were detected in 100\% of those
   subjects classified as definitive, 87\% as probable and 69\% as possible
   FH cases based on DLCNC. The LDLc level was higher in individuals with
   corneal arch and xanthomas or xanthelasmas, as well as in pathogenic or
   probably pathogenic variants carriers. This study showed higher
   frequency of LDLR gene variants compared to other genes related to LDL
   metabolism in individuals with FH in Minas Gerais - Brazil and the
   presence of FH in relatives without previous diagnosis. Our data
   reinforce the importance of molecular and clinical evaluation of FH
   relatives in order to early diagnosis the FH, as well as cardiovascular
   diseases prevention.}},

Abstract = {{More and more events, such as the summer music festivals, are
   considering the possibilities for implementing on-site testing of
   psychoactive drugs in the context of prevention and harm reduction.
   Although the on-site identification is already implemented by plenty of
   drug checking services, the required rapid quantitative dosing of the
   composition of illicit substances is still a missing aspect for a
   successful harm reduction strategy at events. In this paper, an approach
   is presented to identify white powders as amphetamine, cocaine, ketamine
   or others and to estimate the purity of the amphetamine, cocaine and
   ketamine samples using spectroscopic techniques hyphenated with partial
   least squares (PLS) modelling. For identification purposes, it was
   observed that mid-infrared spectroscopy hyphenated with PLS-discriminant
   analysis allowed the distinction between amphetamine, cocaine, ketamine
   and other samples and this with a correct classification rate of 93.1\%
   for an external test set. For quantitative estimation, near-infrared
   spectroscopy was more performant and allowed the estimation of the
   dosage/purity of the amphetamine, cocaine and ketamine samples with an
   error of more or less 10\% w/w. An easily applicable, practical and
   cost-effective approach for on-site characterisation of the majority of
   the psychoactive samples encountered in Belgian nightlife settings based
   on IR spectroscopy was proposed.}},

   electrochemical and photophysical properties of the complexes
   {[}Ir(ppy)(2)(Fpbpy)]{[}PF6] (1aPF(6)), {[}Ir(ppy)(2)(Fpbpy) {[}TFSI]
   (1aTFSI), {[}Ir(ppy)(2)(dmbpy)] - {[}PF6] (3aPF(6)), and
   {[}Ir(ppy)(2)(dmbpy)]{[}TFSI] (3aTFSI) are studied particularly to check
   their suitability in light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs). All
   complexes show aggregationinduced phosphorescent emission (AIPE) due to
   strong intramolecular pi-pi interactions between the adjacent ppy
   ligands that is detected with single-crystal X-ray diffraction.
   Therefore, these complexes exhibit the highest photoluminescence
   efficiency in the solid phase. Furthermore, the relationship between the
   experimental results and time-dependent density functional theory
   (TDDFT) calculations of 1aTFSI and 3aTFSI complexes is examined. The
   effects of TFSI and PF6 counteranions as well as methyl- and
   fluorophenyl-substituted bpy ligand on LEC device performances are
   investigated. LEC devices with 1aTFSI complex show the highest
   efficiency. The resonance effect of the TFSI anion is believed to result
   in the effective accumulation of ions through electrode interface. In
   particular, the LEC device with 1aTFSI was subjected to consecutive
   reverse bias applied every 5 min. Therefore, the effect of charge
   mobility and ion distribution in the device was interpreted. The maximum
   brightness, luminous efficiency, power efficiency, and external quantum
   efficiency values are 10109 cd/m(2), 3.40 cd/A, 1.26 lm/W, and 1.71\%,
   respectively. According to the first reverse bias application, there is
   about 7-fold increase in brightness and power efficiency at the end of
   30 min. The turn-on time is decreased from 69.2 to 24 s.}},

Abstract = {{Background Patients, who discontinue early, do not benefit from phase
   I/II clinical trials (early-phase clinical trials (EPCT)). In this
   study, associations between objective smartphone measurements of
   physical activity and fitness and early trial discontinuation in
   patients with cancer participating in EPCT were investigated. Methods
   Before start of treatment, physical activity (steps/day) and physical
   fitness (meters walked in 6 min) were measured with a smartphone, and
   patient-reported physical function (PRO-PF) was assessed (EORTC
   QLQ-C30-PF). Early trial discontinuation was defined as discontinuation
   <= 28 days. Univariable logistic regression analyses were performed to
   study associations of physical activity, fitness, and function with
   early trial discontinuation. Optimal cutoff values of physical activity
   and fitness were assessed with ROCs, based on positive predictive values
   (PPV). Results Median (interquartile range (IQR)) step count was 4263
   (2548-6897) steps/day, mean +/- standard deviation 6-min walking
   distance was 477 +/- 120 m and median (IQR) PRO-PF score was 83 (67-95)
   points. Fourteen patients (12\%) discontinued the trial early.
   Smartphone measurements of physical activity in units of 100 steps per
   day (odds ratio (OR) = 0.96, 95\% CI = 0.94-0.99, p = 0.01), physical
   fitness (OR = 0.99, 95\% CI = 0.98-0.99, p < 0.01), and PRO-PF (OR =
   0.97, 95\% CI = 0.94-1.00, p = 0.03) were associated with early trial
   discontinuation. Optimal cutoff values were < 900 steps for physical
   activity and < 285 m for physical fitness. PPV for early trial
   discontinuation was 100\% in patients who walked both < 1500 steps per
   day and < 300 m in 6 min. Conclusions Objective smartphone measurements
   of physical activity and fitness are associated with early trial
   discontinuation. However, cutoff values should be externally validated
   in a larger cohort before implementation in clinical practice.}},

Abstract = {{Shipping is a significant contributor to global greenhouse gas (GHG) and
   air pollutant emissions. These emissions mainly come from using diesel
   fuel for power generation. In this paper, the natural gas is proposed as
   an alternative marine fuel to be used instead of conventional marine
   diesel oil. Numerical analysis of environmental and economic benefits of
   the natural gas-diesel dual-fuel engine is carried out. As a case study,
   a container ship of class A7 owned by Hapag-Lloyd has been investigated.
   The results show that the proposed dual-fuel engine achieves
   environmental benefits for reducing carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen
   oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), particulate matter (PM), and carbon
   monoxide (CO) emissions by 20.1\%, 85.5\%, 98\%, 99\%, and 55.7\% with
   cost effectiveness of 109, 840, 9864, 27761, and 4307 US\$/ton,
   respectively. The results show that the conversion process to the
   dual-fuel engine will comply with the current and future IMO regulations
   regarding air pollutant emissions. On the other hand, using the proposed
   dual-fuel engine on the container ship will improve the ship energy
   efficiency index by 29.6 \% with annual fuel cost saving of 4.77 million
   US dollars.}},

Abstract = {{The increase of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and antimalarial
   resistance are complex and severe health issues today, as many microbial
   strains have become resistant to market drugs. The choice for the
   synthesis of new dipeptide-carboxamide derivatives is as a result of
   their wide biological properties such as antimicrobial,
   anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities. The condensation reaction
   of substituted benzenesulphonamoyl pentanamides with the carboxamide
   derivatives using peptide coupling reagents gave targeted products
   (8a-j). The in silico antimalarial and antibacterial studies showed good
   interactions of the compounds with target protein residues and a higher
   dock score in comparison with standard drugs. In the in vivo study,
   compound 8j was the most potent antimalarial agent with 61.90\%
   inhibition comparable with 67\% inhibition for Artemisinin. In the in
   vitro antimicrobial activity, compounds 8a and 8b (MIC 1.2 x 10(-3) M
   and 1.1 x 10(-3) M) were most potent against S. aureus; compound 8a, 8b,
   and 8j with MIC 6.0 x 10(-3) M, 5.7 x 10(-4) M, and 6.5 x 10(-4) M,
   respectively, were the most active against B. subtilis; compound 8b (MIC
   9.5 x 10(-4) M) was most active against E.coli while 8a, 8b and 8d were
   the most active against S. typhi. Compounds 8c and 8h (MIC 1.3 x 10(-3)

   1.3 x 10(-4) M) was most active against A. niger.}},

Abstract = {{The National Hockey League (NHL) entry draft is a process wherein teams
   make sequential selections from a pool of eligible players. Given the
   young age of prospects, drafting requires long-term forecasting of
   future performance under a high level of uncertainty. This study
   assessed the selection accuracy across all seven rounds of the draft, as
   well as between lottery and non-lottery picks within the first round.
   NHL performance data were collected for all forwards (N = 956) and
   defensemen (N = 558) drafted between 2007 and 2014. In both groups,
   Kruskal-Wallis H tests conducted between draft rounds revealed a
   significant, relatively strong, overall effect of draft order on future
   performance. However, Mann-Whitney U post-hoc tests showed projecting
   future performance of forwards was only accurate in the first two
   rounds, while for defensemen, selection was only accurate in the first
   round. Moreover, forwards selected with lottery picks in the first round
   outperformed their non-lottery peers offensively but not defensively. As
   for defensemen, those selected with lottery picks did not differ from
   their non-lottery peers in offensive or defensive performance. Our
   findings highlight substantial inaccuracies in the NHL draft,
   particularly past the first two rounds of selection. We offer multiple
   possible explanations driving such inaccuracies that could form the
   basis for further work in this area.}},

Abstract = {{Background Diagnosis of intensive care unit acquired weakness (ICUAW) is
   challenging. Pathogenesis of underlying critical illness
   polyneuromyopathy (CIPNM) remains incompletely understood. This
   exploratory study investigated whether longitudinal neuromuscular
   ultrasound examinations and cytokine analyses in correlation to
   classical clinical and electrophysiological assessment contribute to the
   understanding of CIPNM. Methods Intensive care unit patients were
   examined every 7 days until discharge from hospital. Clinical status,
   nerve conduction studies, electromyography as well as ultrasound of
   peripheral nerves and tibial anterior muscle were performed. Cytokine
   levels were analyzed by a bead-based multiplex assay system. Results Of
   248 screened patients, 35 patients were included at median of 6 days
   (IQR: 8) after admission to intensive care unit. Axonal damage was the
   main feature of CIPNM. At the peak of CIPNM (7 days after inclusion),
   nerve ultrasound showed cross-sectional area increase of tibial nerve as
   a sign of inflammatory edema as well as hypoechoic nerves as a possible
   sign of inflammation. Cytokine analyses showed signs of monocyte and
   macrophage activation at this stage. Fourteen days after inclusion,
   cytokines indicated systemic immune response as well as profiles
   associated to neovascularization and regeneration. Conclusions
   Exploratory neuromuscular ultrasound and cytokine analyses showed signs
   of inflammation like macrophage and monocyte activation at the peak of
   CIPNM followed by a systemic immune response parallel to axonal damage.
   This underlines the role of both axonal damage and inflammation in
   pathogenesis of CIPNM.}},

Abstract = {{Macrophages are mainly divided into two populations, which play a
   different role in physiological and pathological conditions. The
   differentiation of these cells may be regulated by transcription
   factors. However, it is unclear how to modulate these transcription
   factors to affect differentiation of these cells. Here, we found that
   lncLy6C, a novel ultraconserved lncRNA, promotes differentiation of
   Ly6C(high) inflammatory monocytes into Ly6C(low/neg) resident
   macrophages. We demonstrate that gut microbiota metabolites butyrate
   upregulates the expression of lncLy6C. LncLy6C deficient mice had
   markedly increased Ly6C(high) pro-inflammatory monocytes and reduced
   Ly6C(neg) resident macrophages. LncLy6C not only bound with
   transcription factor C/EBP beta but also bound with multiple lysine
   methyltransferases of H3K4me3 to specifically promote the enrichment of
   C/EBP beta and H3K4me3 marks on the promoter region of Nr4A1, which can
   promote Ly6C(high) into Ly6C(neg) macrophages. As a result, lncLy6C
   causes the upregulation of Nr4A1 to promote Ly6C(high) inflammatory
   monocytes to differentiate into Ly6C(int/neg) resident macrophages.}},

Abstract = {{Background Chronic opioid use can induce esophageal dysfunction with
   symptoms resembling achalasia and a manometric pattern of
   esophagogastric junction-outflow obstruction (EGJ-OO). However, the
   effect of opioids in acute setting on pharyngeal function and esophageal
   body contractility has not been investigated.
   Methods After positioning the high-resolution impedance manometry (HRiM)
   catheter, codeine (60 mg) or placebo (glucose syrup) was infused
   intragastrically. Forty-five minutes post-infusion, participants
   received liquid, semi-solid, and solid boluses to assess esophageal and
   pharyngeal function. HRiM analysis was performed adhering to the Chicago
   classification v3.0. (CC v3.0). Pressure flow analysis (PFA) for the
   esophageal body and the pharynx was performed using the SwallowGateway
   (TM) online platform.
   Key Results Nineteen healthy volunteers (HV) {[}5 male; age 38.3] were
   included. After codeine administration, higher integrated relaxation
   pressure 4 s values resulted in significantly reduced deglutitive EGJ
   relaxation and distal latency was significantly shorter. Distal
   contractility was similar in both conditions. Bolus flow resistance at
   the EGJ and distention pressures increased significantly after codeine
   infusion. Based on CC v3.0, acute infusion of codeine induced EGJ-OO in
   six HV (p = 0.0003 vs. placebo). Codeine administration induced no
   significant alterations in any of the pharyngeal PFA metrics.
   Conclusions \& Inferences In HV, acute administration of codeine
   increased bolus resistance at the EGJ secondary to induced incomplete
   EGJ relaxation leading to major motility disorders in a subset of
   subjects including EGJ-OO. However, an acute single dose of codeine did
   not affect motility or bolus flow in pharynx and UES. ClinicalTrials.gov

   in a tube oven as a function of sulfurization temperature. The crystal
   structure, the optical and morphological properties of grown\&annealed
   CZTS ultrathin films were examined by XRD, UV-vis spectra, AFM,
   respectively. The electrical characteristics of CZTS heterojunction
   solar cell in the darkness, which were investigated by the conventional
   J-V Method, Cheung Cheung Method and Norde Method. As the thickness of
   CZTS ultrathin films increased, the forward current of CZTS
   heterojunctions increased and their ideality factor, serial resistance
   and barrier height decreased. Also, the efficiency of Ag/CZTS/Si/Al
   heterojunction solar cells have been examined and characterised as a
   function of CZTS ultrathin film thickness under the illumination
   conditions. J-V curves of CZTS heterojunction solar cells were
   determined under AM 1.5 solar radiation in 80 MW/cm(2), all CZTS

Title = {{Diabetic Complications and Factors Affecting Glycemic Control Among
   Patients With Type II Diabetes Mellitus Attending the Chronic Illness
   Clinics at Tabuk, Saudi Arabia}},
Journal = {{CUREUS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most common diseases worldwide and
   affects many patients all over the globe. Diabetic complications vary
   between microvascular and macrovascular, affecting a wide range of
   organs and systems in the body. Understanding, determining, and in
   return, preventing such factors is essential to alleviate the quality of
   life of diabetic patients. Therefore, we aim to determine the poor
   glycemic control and the factors associated with it in our diabetes
   population.
   Methods
   This is a retrospective study where data was reviewed for all patients
   with Type II DM (T2DM) who attended the chronic illness clinic at King
   Khaled Hospital in Tabuk. We included patients aged >= 18 years, of
   Saudi nationality, and residents of the Tabuk region. Any patient not
   satisfying all the inclusion criteria was excluded from the current
   study. Diagnosis with diabetes was made according to the American
   Diabetes Association guidelines, 2020. Patients' demographic data,
   medical history, and social and lifestyle history were extracted from
   records. In addition, age, body mass index (BMI), drugs (insulin vs.
   oral hypoglycemic agents), duration of the disease, lipid profile, and
   other comorbidities were also extracted from the files. A pvalue of
   <0.05 was selected as the statistically significant level in all tests.
   Results
   A total of 697 patients were included in the current study, with a mean
   age of 58.2 +/- 11.6 years. The mean glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of
   the study participants was 8.4 +/- 1.7\%, and their fasting blood sugar
   (FBS) level was 9.9 +/- 3.9 mmol/l. With HbA1c cut-off at 7\%, the
   overall prevalence of poor glycemic control was 81.5\% (565/693). A
   higher prevalence of poor glycemic control was reported among study
   participants with higher DM duration (p=0.002). Diabetes complications
   were found in 208 (29.8\%) of the study participants, where
   microvascular complications were present in 140 patients, and
   microvascular ones were found in 102. In the logistic regression model,
   older patients were less prone to poor glycemic control (OR=0.98; 95\%
   CI=0.96-0.99; p=0.010). In addition, longer disease duration was a
   predictive factor of poor glycemic control (OR=1.05; 95\% CI=1.02-1.08;
   p=0.003). Furthermore, the usage of combined insulin and tablet
   treatments were associated with a higher risk of poor glycemic control
   when compared to insulin only treatments (OR=4.65; 95\% CI=1.55-13.94;
   p=0.006).
   Conclusion
   The results of this study indicate a high prevalence rate of poor
   glycemic control among Saudi patients, which is higher than previous
   reports have shown. More interest should be given to awareness programs
   with regard to promoting self-control protocols for the disease.}},

Title = {{The direct and indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the care of
   patients with pituitary disease: a cross sectional study}},
Journal = {{PITUITARY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{24}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is widely
   believed to have had a major impact on the care of patients with
   pituitary disease. The virus itself may directly result in death, and
   patients with adrenal insufficiency, often a part of hypopituitarism,
   are thought to represent a particularly susceptible subgroup. Moreover,
   even in patients that do not contract the virus, the diversion of
   resources by healthcare institutions to manage the virus may indirectly
   result in delays in their management. To this end, the aim of this study
   was to determine the direct and indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
   on patients with pituitary disease. Methods A cross-sectional study
   design was adopted, with all adult patients seen by our pituitary
   service in the year prior to the nationwide lockdown on March 23rd 2020
   invited to participate in a telephone survey. Results In all, 412
   patients (412/586; 70.3\%) participated in the survey. 66 patients
   (66/412; 16.0\%) reported having suspected COVID-19 infection. Of the 10
   patients in this group tested for COVID-19 infection, three received a
   positive test result. No deaths due to COVID-19 were identified. 267
   patients (267/412; 64.8\%) experienced a delay or change in the planned
   care for their pituitary disease, with 100 patients (100/412; 24.3\%)
   perceiving an impact to their care. Conclusions Whilst only a small
   percentage of patients had confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection,
   over half were still indirectly impacted by the pandemic through a delay
   or change to their planned care.}},

Abstract = {{Electrochemiluminescence (ECL) is a powerful transduction technique in
   biosensing and diagnostics, while mechanistic studies are still scarce.
   Herein we report the combined use of microtube electrode (MTE) and
   microscopy to measure the thickness of ECL layer (TEL) to decipher
   reaction mechanisms. For the classical system involving tris(2,2
   `-bipyridyl)ruthenium and tri-n-propylamine, the ECL pattern generated
   at the MTE tends to change from ring to spot upon increasing the
   luminophore concentration, with the TEL varying from ca. 3.1 mu m to
   >4.5 mu m. This variation is rationalized to arise from the contribution
   of the so-called catalytic route. While using 2-(dibutylamino)ethanol as
   the co-reactant, the ECL pattern remains ring-shaped and independent on
   the luminophore concentration. The TEL in this case is ca. 2.1 mu m,
   implying that ECL generation is always surface-confined. MTEs can thus
   act as optical rulers for measuring the TEL and providing insightful
   mechanistic information.}},

Title = {{Suicide by young Australians, 2006-2015: a cross-sectional analysis of
   national coronial data}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess the demographic, social, and clinical
   characteristics of young Australians who die by suicide.
   Design: Retrospective analysis of National Coronial Information System
   (NCIS) data.
   Setting, participants: People aged 10-24 years who died by suicide in
   Australia during 2006-2015.
   Main outcome measures: Demographic, social, and clinical characteristics
   of young people who died by suicide; circumstances of death recorded in
   the NCIS.
   Results: 3365 young people died of suicide during 2006- 2015 (including
   2473 boys and men, 73.5\%); 1292 people (38.4\%) lived in areas of
   greater socio- economic disadvantage. Free text reports were included in
   the NCIS for 3027 people (90\%), of whom 1237 (40.9\%) had diagnosed
   mental health disorders and 475 (15.7\%) had possible mental health
   disorders. Alcohol consumption near the time of death was detected in
   1015 of 3027 cases (33.5\%); histories of self-harm were recorded in 940
   cases (31.1\%) and of illicit substance misuse in 852 (28.1\%). Adverse
   life events included history of abuse or neglect ( 223, 7.4\%), suicide
   of relatives, friends, or acquaintances (202, 6.7\%), and financial
   difficulties (174, 5.8\%).
   Conclusions: Three-quarters of the young people who died by suicide were
   boys or young men, and 57\% had diagnosed or possible mental health
   disorders, suggesting that the mental health and wellbeing of young
   Australians should be a key target for youth suicide prevention. To
   reduce the number of youth suicides, it is imperative that prevention
   strategies target the mental health and psychosocial stressors that lead
   to suicidal crises in young people.}},

Abstract = {{A major advance was made to reduce the side effects of cancer therapy
   via the elucidation of the tumor-specific lytic path ``hyperploid
   progression-mediated death{''} targeting retinoblastoma (Rb) or
   p53-mutants defective in G1 DNA damage checkpoint. The genetic basis of
   human cancers was uncovered through the cloning of the tumor suppressor
   Rb gene. It encodes a nuclear DNA-binding protein whose self-interaction
   is regulated by cyclin-dependent kinases. A 3D-structure of Rb dimer is
   shown, confirming its multimeric status. Rb assumes a central role in
   cell cycle regulation and the ``Rb pathway{''} is universally
   inactivated in human cancers. Hyperploidy refers to a state in which
   cells contain one or more extra chromosomes. Hyperploid progression
   occurs due to continued cell-cycling without cytokinesis in G1
   checkpoint-defective cancer cells. The evidence for the triggering of
   hyperploid progression- mediated death in RB-mutant human retinoblastoma
   cells is shown. Hence, the very genetic mutation that predisposes to
   cancer can be exploited to induce lethality. The discovery helped to
   establish the principle of targeted cytotoxic cancer therapy at the
   mechanistic level. By triggering the lytic path, targeted therapy with
   tumor specificity at the genetic level can be developed. It sets the
   stage for systematically eliminating side effects for cytotoxic cancer
   therapy.}},

Title = {{A Combined Effect of Expression Levels of Obesity-Related Genes and
   Clinical Factors on Cancer Survival Rate}},
Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{Obesity is directly associated with the risk of cancer in different
   organs, including breast, colon, and kidney. However, adipocytes could
   be utilized to control progression for some types of cancer, such as
   leukemia and breast cancer. To explore the potential correlation between
   adipocytes and cancer, the combined effect of expression levels of
   obesity-related genes and clinical factors (i.e., gender, race,
   menopausal status, history of smoking, tumor grade, body mass index
   (BMI), and history of drinking) on cancer survival rate was systemically
   studied. The expression levels of obesity-related genes in cancer
   tissues and normal tissues were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas
   (TCGA). Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted using R programming language.
   The log-rank test was applied to explore the correlation between
   different clinical subgroups. The overexpression of the nine
   obesity-related genes (MC4R, TMEM18, KCTD15, GNPDA2, SH2B1, MTCH2, FTO,
   PCSK1, and GPR120) may associate with tumor-promoting factors in some
   organs (head and neck, gastrointestinal tract, liver, and gallbladder).
   Underexpressed LEPR, NEGR1, TMEM18, and SH2B1 genes prevented the
   progression and metastasis of kidney cancer. The combined effect of
   clinical factors and the expression levels of obesity-related genes on
   patients' survival was found to be significant. Our outcomes suggested
   that the alternations of DNA methylation patterns could result in the
   changes of expression levels of obesity-related genes, playing a
   critical role in tumor progression. The results of the current study may
   be utilized to supplement precision and personalized medicine, as well
   as provide novel insights for the development of treatment approaches
   for cancer.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Problem This study localized CD45(+) immune cells and compared changes
   in their numbers between term, not in labor (TNIL) and term, labor (TL)
   human fetal membranes.
   Method of study Fetal membranes (amniochorion) from normal TNIL and TL
   subjects were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescence
   (IF), and flow cytometry for evidence of total (CD45(+)) immune cells as
   well as innate immune cells (neutrophils, macrophages and NK cells)
   using specific markers. Fetal origin of immune cells was determined
   using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for SRY gene in Y chromosome.
   Results CD45(+) cells were localized in human fetal membranes for both
   TNIL and TL. A threefold increase in CD45(+) cells was seen in TL fetal
   membranes of (7.73\% +/- 2.35) compared to TNIL (2.36\% +/- 0.78). This
   increase is primarily contributed by neutrophils. Macrophages and NK
   cells did not change in the membranes between TNIL and TL. Leukocytes of
   fetal origin are present in the fetal membranes.
   Conclusion The fetal membranes without decidua contain a small
   proportion of immune cells. Some of these immune cells in the fetal
   membrane are fetal in origin. There is a moderate increase of immune
   cells in the fetal membranes at term labor; however, it is unclear
   whether this is a cause or consequence of labor. Further functional
   studies are needed to determine their contribution to membrane
   inflammation associated with parturition.}},

Title = {{``Two-Cell Assemblage{''} Assay: A Simple in vitro Method for Screening
   Hair Growth-Promoting Compounds}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{Alopecia arises due to inadequate hair follicle (HF) stem cell
   activation or proliferation, resulting in prolongation of the telogen
   phase of the hair cycle. Increasing therapeutic and cosmetic demand for
   alleviating alopecia has driven research toward the discovery or
   synthesis of novel compounds that can promote hair growth by inducing HF
   stem cell activation or proliferation and initiating the anagen phase.
   Although several methods for evaluating the hair growth-promoting
   effects of candidate compounds are being used, most of these methods are
   difficult to use for large scale simultaneous screening of various
   compounds. Herein, we introduce a simple and reliable in vitro assay for
   the simultaneous screening of the hair growth-promoting effects of
   candidate compounds on a large scale. In this study, we first
   established a 3D co-culture system of human dermal papilla (hDP) cells
   and human outer root sheath (hORS) cells in an ultra-low attachment
   96-well plate, where the two cell types constituted a polar elongated
   structure, named ``two-cell assemblage (TCA).{''} We observed that the
   long axis length of the TCA gradually increased for 5 days, maintaining
   biological functional integrity as reflected by the increased expression
   levels of hair growth-associated genes after treatment with hair
   growth-promoting molecules. Interestingly, the elongation of the TCA was
   more prominent following treatment with the hair growth-promoting
   molecules (which occurred in a dose-dependent manner), compared to the
   control group (p < 0.05). Accordingly, we set the long axis length of
   the TCA as an endpoint of this assay, using a micro confocal
   high-content imaging system to measure the length, which can provide
   reproducible and reliable results in an adequate timescale. The
   advantages of this assay are: (i) it is physiologically and practically
   advantageous as it uses 3D cultured two-type human cells which are
   easily available; (ii) it is simple as it uses length as the only
   endpoint; and (iii) it is a high throughput system, which screens
   various compounds simultaneously. In conclusion, the ``TCA{''} assay
   could serve as an easy and reliable method to validate the hair
   growth-promoting effect of a large volume of library molecules.}},

Abstract = {{6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) is widely used in the treatment of acute
   lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and its cytotoxicity is primarily mediated
   by thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) metabolites. A recent genomewide
   association study has identified germline polymorphisms (e.g.,
   rs72846714) in the NT5C2 gene associated with 6-MP metabolism in
   patients with ALL. However, the full spectrum of genetic variation in
   NT5C2 is unclear and its impact on 6-MP drug activation has not been
   comprehensively examined. To this end, we performed targeted sequencing
   of NT5C2 in 588 children with ALL and identified 121 single nucleotide
   polymorphisms nominally associated with erythrocyte TGN during 6-MP
   treatment (P < 0.05). Of these, 61 variants were validated in a
   replication cohort of 372 children with ALL. After considering linkage
   disequilibrium and multivariate analysis, we confirmed two clusters of
   variants, represented by rs72846714 and rs58700372, that independently
   affected 6-MP metabolism. Functional studies showed that rs58700372
   directly altered the activity of an intronic enhancer, with the variant
   allele linked to higher transcription activity and reduced 6-MP
   metabolism (lower TGN). By contrast, rs72846714 was not located in a
   regulatory element and instead its association signal was explained by
   linkage disequilibrium with a proximal functional variant rs12256506
   that activated NT5C2 transcription in-cis. Our results indicated that
   NT5C2 germline variation significantly contributes to interpatient

   Filtration in Mining-Impacted Alluvial Floodplains}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN WATER}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Water quality impacts from artisanal and small-scale alluvial (placer)
   gold mining operations occur in developing economies across several
   continents including Asia, Africa, and South America. They often occur
   in remote and/or resource-poor settings in which mitigation strategies
   must contend with extreme seasonal variation in river flow as well as
   the economic incentive to periodically churn (mine) alluvial floodplains
   without riparian restoration. A novel strategy addressing these
   constraints is herein explored which employs the alluvial floodplain for
   filtration-driven removal of particulate contaminants and gold from
   streams. This process of lateral channel filtration is explored in the
   Rio Nambija of southern Ecuador, in terms of success in achieving the
   hydraulic objective of passively driven lateral flow, and the
   corresponding removal of particulate contaminants (e.g., total mercury,
   lead, iron, and manganese) by filtration. Accumulation of gold was
   examined to evaluate whether incorporation of this proposed practice in
   alluvial (placer) mining can reduce particle-bound contaminants in
   streams and simultaneously increase economic benefit. Excavation of
   channels lateral to mining-impacted streams was shown to achieve the
   hydraulic, water quality, and economic (gold accumulation) objectives.
   The modest flow capture for any given lateral segment, along with the
   months-long timescale associated with economic gold accumulation and
   clogging by suspended solids, dictate a ``cultivation{''} process
   whereby multiple lateral segments are worked annually.}},

Abstract = {{Engineering the composition of perovskite active layers has been
   critical in increasing the efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs)
   to more than 25\% in the latest reports. Partial substitutions of the
   monovalent cation and the halogen have been adopted in the
   highest-performing devices, but the precise role of bromine
   incorporation remains incompletely explained. Here we use quasielastic
   neutron scattering (QENS) to study, as a function of the degree of
   bromine incorporation, the dynamics of organic cations in triple-cation
   lead mixed-halide perovskites. We find that the inclusion of bromine
   suppresses low-energy rotations of formamidinium (FA), and we find that
   inhibiting FA rotation correlates with a longer-lived carrier lifetime.
   When the fraction of bromine approaches 0.15 on the halogen site-a
   composition used extensively in the PSC literature-the fraction of
   actively rotating FA molecules is minimized: indeed, the fraction of
   rotating FA is suppressed by more than 25\% compared to the bromine-free
   perovskite.\textbackslash{}}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN COMMUNICATION}},

Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{As the number of COVID-19 cases climbed in the United States, President
   Trump came under fire for dismissing its severity despite evidence to
   the contrary. Those most impressionable by the President's claims might
   be those who have established a parasocial relationship with him.
   Results of this survey study indicate that each of the three parasocial
   variables assessed (i.e., friends, understanding, and brand), were
   negatively related to information seeking for COVID-19. Moreover,
   initial evidence was found that identification with the Trump brand was
   an indirect influence of information seeking. Consistent with the
   supported model, women and Democrats reported higher information seeking
   for COVID-19 than men and other political groups.}},

Title = {{Deletion of Akt1 Promotes Kidney Fibrosis in a Murine Model of
   Unilateral Ureteral Obstruction}},
Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{We investigated the role of Akt1, one of the three isoforms of Akt, in
   renal fibrosis using the murine model of unilateral ureteral obstruction
   (UUO). We subjected wild type and Akt1(-/-) mice to UUO. The Akt1 gene
   was silenced in vitro using short hairpin RNA delivered via a lentiviral
   vector in human proximal tubular cells (HK2 cells) and kidney
   fibroblasts (NRK-49F cells). The obstructive kidneys of Akt1(-/-) mice
   showed more severe tubulointerstitial fibrosis than those of wild type
   mice. The expression of fibronectin and type I collagen was
   significantly increased in obstructed kidneys of Akt1(-/-) mice compared
   to those of wild type mice. The important finding was that the
   expression of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1) was
   significantly increased in the Akt1(-/-) mice compared to the wild type
   mice. The knockdown of Akt1 enhanced the expression of TGF beta 1 in HK2
   cells. Interestingly, the upregulation of TGF beta 1 due to genetic
   knockdown of Akt1 was associated with activation of signal transducer
   and activator of transcript 3 (STAT3) independently of the Smad pathway
   in NRK-49F and HK2 cells. Immunohistochemical staining also showed that
   expression of phosphorylated STAT3 was more increased in Akt1(-/-) mice
   than in wild type mice after UUO. Additionally, the deletion of Akt1 led
   to apoptosis of the renal tubular cells in both in vivo and in vitro
   studies. Conclusively, these results suggest that the deletion of Akt1
   may contribute to renal fibrosis via induction of the TGF beta 1/STAT3
   pathway in a murine model of UUO.}},

Abstract = {{Visualizing live-cell uptake of small-molecule drugs is paramount for
   drug development and pharmaceutical sciences. Bioorthogonal imaging with
   click chemistry has made significant contributions to the field,
   visualizing small molecules in cells. Furthermore, recent developments
   in Raman microscopy, including stimulated Raman scattering (SRS)
   microscopy, have realized direct visualization of alkyne-tagged
   small-molecule drugs in live cells. However, Raman and SRS microscopy
   still suffer from limited detection sensitivity with low concentration
   molecules for observing temporal dynamics of drug uptake. Here, we
   demonstrate the combination of alkyne-tag and surface-enhanced Raman
   scattering (SERS) microscopy for the real-time monitoring of drug uptake
   in live cells. Gold nanoparticles are introduced into lysosomes of live
   cells by endocytosis and work as SERS probes. Raman signals of alkynes
   can be boosted by enhanced electric fields generated by plasmon
   resonance of gold nanoparticles when alkyne-tagged small molecules are
   colocalized with the nanoparticles. With time-lapse 3D SERS imaging,
   this technique allows us to investigate drug uptake by live cells with
   different chemical and physical conditions. We also perform quantitative
   evaluation of the uptake speed at the single-cell level using digital
   SERS counting under different quantities of drug molecules and
   temperature conditions. Our results illustrate that alkyne-tag SERS
   microscopy has a potential to be an alternative bioorthogonal imaging
   technique to investigate temporal dynamics of small-molecule uptake of
   live cells for pharmaceutical research.}},

   Lyapunov exponents of F with accuracy epsilon. We also compute the

Abstract = {{External policy networks resolve two collective action problems in EU
   external relations: engaging nonstate actors from the EU and its partner
   countries in transnational policymaking and converting this engagement
   to feedback for policymakers. We use formal network analysis to
   understand the relationship between network structure and collective
   action by transnational nonstate actors. Our empirical focus is on the
   Transatlantic Business Council and the Transatlantic Consumer Dialogue
   networks, which engage business and consumer advocacy organizations in
   transatlantic economic policymaking. We find that both are highly
   centralized around EU and US government institutions, with relatively
   low, but rising, levels of interaction among nonstate organizations.
   This structure helps increase engagement by giving organizations
   opportunities to interact with government institutions, learn from their
   peers, and, for some, to exercise power. It also helps EU and US
   institutions harness policy feedback, especially from nonstate actors
   that have frequent interactions with their peers.}},

Abstract = {{The neurotrophic potential of SARS-CoV-2 virus is manifesting as various
   neurological disorders in the present pandemic. Nervous system
   involvement can be due to the direct action of the virus on the brain
   tissue or due to an indirect action through the activation of
   immune-mediated mechanisms. This study will discuss the detailed
   systematically evaluated clinical profile and relevant investigations
   and outcome of 14 laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive patients
   presenting with neurological signs and symptoms. The patients were
   further categorized into confirmed, probable, and possible neurological
   associations. The probable association was found in meningoencephalitis
   (n = 4), stroke (n = 2), Guillain-Barre syndrome (n = 1), and anosmia (n
   = 1). The other six patients had coexisting neurological diseases with
   SARS-CoV-2. One patient with a large artery stroke succumbed to the
   illness due to respiratory complication. Memory impairment as a sequela
   is present during follow up of one encephalitis patient. Presently the
   early recognition and diagnosis of neurological manifestations remains a
   challenge for clinicians as the SARS-CoV-2 related neurological
   manifestations are in evolution. A long-term correlation study of
   clinical profile, radiological and laboratory investigations, along with
   neuropathological studies is needed to further understand the
   pathophysiology behind the SARS-CoV-2 neurological manifestations.
   Further understanding will facilitate timely recognition, therapeutic
   intervention, and possible prevention of long-term sequalae.}},

Title = {{Derivation and utility of an A beta-PET pathology accumulation index to

Journal = {{NEUROLOGY}},

Volume = {{95}},

Pages = {{E2834-E2844}},
Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   To evaluate a novel beta-amyloid (A beta)-PET-based quantitative measure
   (A beta accumulation index {[}A beta index]), including the assessment
   of its ability to discriminate between participants based on A beta
   status using visual read, CSF A beta(42)/A beta(40), and post-mortem
   neuritic plaque burden as standards of truth.
   Methods
   One thousand one hundred twenty-one participants (with and without
   cognitive impairment) were scanned with A beta-PET: Swedish BioFINDER, n
   = 392, {[}F-18]flutemetamol; Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
   (ADNI), n = 692, {[}F-18]florbetapir; and a phase 3 end-of-life study, n
   = 100, {[}F-18] flutemetamol. The relationships between A beta index and
   standardized uptake values ratios (SUVR) from A beta-PET were assessed.
   The diagnostic performances of A beta index and SUVR were compared with
   visual reads, CSF A beta(42)/A beta(40), and A beta histopathology used
   as reference standards.
   Results
   Strong associations were observed between A beta index and SUVR (R-2:
   BioFINDER 0.951, ADNI 0.943, end-of-life, 0.916). Both measures
   performed equally well in differentiating A beta-positive from A
   beta-negative participants, with areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.979
   to 0.991 to detect abnormal visual reads, AUCs of 0.961 to 0.966 to
   detect abnormal CSF A beta(42)/A beta(40), and AUCs of 0.820 to 0.823 to
   detect abnormal A beta histopathology. Both measures also showed a
   similar distribution across postmortem-based A beta phases (based on
   anti-A beta 4G8 antibodies). Compared to models using visual read alone,
   the addition of the A beta index resulted in a significant increase in
   AUC and a decrease in Akaike information criterion to detect abnormal A
   beta histopathology.
   Conclusion
   The proposed A beta index showed a tight association to SUVR and carries
   an advantage over the latter in that it does not require the definition
   of regions of interest or the use of MRI. A beta index may thus prove
   simpler to implement in clinical settings and may also facilitate the
   comparison of findings using different A beta-PET tracers.
   Classification of evidence
   This study provides Class III evidence that the A beta accumulation
   index accurately differentiates A beta-positive from A beta-negative
   participants compared to A beta-PET visual reads, CSF A beta(42)/A
   beta(40), and A beta histopathology.}},

Abstract = {{Gene expression is controlled by the collective binding of transcription
   factors to cis-regulatory regions. Deciphering gene-centered regulatory
   networks is vital to understanding and controlling gene misexpression in
   human disease; however, systematic approaches to uncovering regulatory
   networks have been lacking. Here we present high-throughput
   interrogation of gene-centered activation networks (HIGAN), a pipeline
   that employs a suite of multifaceted genomic approaches to connect
   upstream signaling inputs, trans-acting TFs, and cis-regulatory
   elements. We apply HIGAN to understand the aberrant activation of the
   cytidine deaminase APOBEC3B, an intrinsic source of cancer
   hypermutation. We reveal that nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) and
   AP-1 pathways are the most salient trans-acting inputs, with minor roles
   for other inflammatory pathways. We identify a cis-regulatory
   architecture dominated by a major intronic enhancer that requires
   coordinated NF-kappa B and AP-1 activity with secondary inputs from
   distal regulatory regions. Our data demonstrate how integration of cis
   and trans genomic screening platforms provides a paradigm for building
   genecentered regulatory networks.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), caused by JC
   polyomavirus, is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system
   that primarily affects oligodendrocytes. It can cause significant
   morbidity and mortality. An early diagnosis is of high relevance as
   timely immune reconstitution is essential. However, diagnosis can be
   challenging if virus detection via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) PCR remains
   negative. Hence, identifying CSF biomarkers for this disease is of
   crucial importance. We applied a targeted metabolomic screen to CSF from
   23 PML patients and eight normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) patients
   as controls. Out of 188 potentially detectable metabolites, 48 (13 amino
   acids, 4 biogenic amines, 1 acylcarnitine, 21 phosphatidylcholines, 8
   sphingolipids, and the sum of hexoses) passed the quality screen and
   were included in the analyses. Even though there was a tendency towards
   lower concentrations in PML (mostly of phosphatidylcholines and
   sphingomyelins), none of the differences between PML and controls in
   individual metabolite concentrations reached statistical significance
   (lowest p = 0.104) and there were no potential diagnostic biomarkers
   (highest area under the ROC curve 0.68). Thus, CSF metabolite changes in
   PML are likely subtle and possibly larger group sizes and broader
   metabolite screens are needed to identify potential CSF metabolite
   biomarkers for PML.}},

Abstract = {{A dialogical model of psychosis proposed that the collapse of dialogue
   may explain the alterations in sense of self and agency observed in
   psychosis. This view was hampered by lack of clarity regarding the
   processes that support or hinder dialogue. Since then, research on
   metacognition has offered an alternative but also partially
   complementary approach. To explore this issue a brief history of the
   original dialogical conceptualization of psychosis and the difficulties
   that it confronts is offered along with the essential contributions of
   research on metacognition in psychosis. Next, we explore how this more
   recent research has deepened the exploration of some core ideas of
   dialogical self theory, including the multiplicity of the self, while
   calling into question other aspects of that theory. Lastly, we discuss
   issues awaiting future research including models linking disturbances in
   basic brain function, social injustice, community connection, and
   self-experience in psychosis from the frame of a network.}},

Title = {{The Emotion Regulation Roots of Job Satisfaction}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{Job satisfaction is a core variable in the study and practice of
   organizational psychology because of its implications for desirable work
   outcomes. Knowledge of its antecedents is abundant and informative, but
   there are still psychological processes underlying job satisfaction that
   have not received complete attention. This is the case of employee
   emotion regulation. In this study, we argue that employees' behaviors
   directed to manage their affective states participate in their level of
   job satisfaction and hypothesize that employee affect-improving and
   -worsening emotion regulation behaviors increase and decrease,
   respectively, job satisfaction, through the experience of positive and
   negative affect. Using a diary study with a sample of professionals from
   diverse jobs and organizations, for the most part, the mediational
   hypotheses were supported by the results albeit a more complex
   relationship was found in the case of affect worsening emotion
   regulation. This study contributes to expanding the job satisfaction and
   emotion regulation literatures and informs practitioners in people
   management in organizations about another route to foster and sustain
   positive attitudes at work.}},

Abstract = {{During respiration-based activities, possibly ejected microorganisms
   such as viruses pass from an infected subject to a target person through
   aerosol droplets. Research focused mostly on the mechanisms of aerosol
   generation, the droplet size, initial velocity, velocity and size
   distribution, the indoor aerosol propagation. We here consider the
   saliva aerosol associated with breath and light cough chosen since they
   are the standard and much common, gentle respiratory activities. We
   study the propagation in stagnant air of such aerosols from a point
   placed ahead of the mouth at a distance from it such that we can
   approximate the ejecta as a non-turbulent flux. We focus on different
   outdoor environments for selected weather conditions. We analyze the
   free fall of droplets (diameter, 5 mu m to 200 mu m), verifying whether
   they evaporate, or they impact on the ground, for different environment
   temperature, pressure, and relative humidity values. We provide a
   two-dimensional description of the evaporation path and of the dynamics
   of droplets (diameter, 5 mu m to 100 mu m) either moving within the air
   flux associated with the aerosol, or settling out of it and experiencing
   free fall through air. Calculated droplet propagation distances with the
   boundary conditions for the considered environments can be useful when
   discussing prevention measures to limit airborne transmission of
   pathogens.

Title = {{Alcohol lean burn in heavy duty engines: Achieving 25 bar IMEP with high
   efficiency in spark ignited operation}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINE RESEARCH}},
Abstract = {{Knock is the most crucial limitation in attaining the peak load required
   at high efficiency in heavy duty (HD) spark ignition (SI) engines.
   Renewable fuels such as ethanol and methanol have high resistance to
   autoignition and can help overcome this limitation. To reduce knock and
   improve efficiency further, dilution can be used to add specific heat
   capacity and reduce combustion temperature. This work studied diluted
   combustion and knock characteristics of gasoline, ethanol, and methanol
   on a HD SI single cylinder engine for a wide load range. Ethanol and
   methanol displayed excellent knock resistance which allowed a peak gross
   IMEP of 25.1 and 26.8 bar respectively, compared to gasoline which only
   reached 8.3 bar at lambda = 1.4 with a compression ratio of 13. Over
   18\% increase in gross IMEP was possible for gasoline and ethanol when
   increasing air excess ratio from 1 to 1.4. Methanol achieved the target
   gross IMEP at lambda = 1 and required no spark retard at lambda = 1.6. A
   peak indicated efficiency above 48\% was recorded for ethanol and
   methanol at lambda = 1.6 and gross IMEP of approximately 21 bar. At part
   loads, stable operation was possible until lambda = 1.8 for all fuels.
   Increase in intake temperature showed a marginal improvement in
   stability but no increase in lean limit. The concept shows promise as
   diluted combustion of ethanol and methanol reduced knock and achieved
   diesel baseline load. With optimization, there is potential to improve
   efficiency further and possible cost savings compared to commercial
   diesel engines.}},

Title = {{Reported pedagogical practices of faculty in higher education in the UAE}},
Journal = {{HIGHER EDUCATION}},
Abstract = {{Higher education in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a relatively
   modern phenomenon, but it is a sector which has experienced immense
   growth since the first national university opened in 1976. A wide
   diversity of faculty, in terms of experience, nationalities, and
   qualifications, is employed to teach in the country's higher education
   institutions. In this article, the faculty's reported pedagogical
   practices taking place in universities across the country are reported.
   A well-established, pre-developed survey tool was used to gather
   quantitative data which ultimately classifies responses as employing
   more student-centric or teacher-centric approaches. A total of 130
   participants, drawn from multiple institutions, were surveyed. The
   findings indicated that overall, faculty tended to adopt a
   student-centric approach to teaching significantly more frequently than
   a teacher-centric approach. However, there were significant variations
   in the adoption of student- or teacher-centric approaches by faculty
   gender, subject specialism, and presence of a vocational teaching
   qualification. Female faculty adopted a student-centric approach to
   teaching significantly more frequently than did their male counterparts.
   However, STEM faculty adopted a teacher-centric approach to teaching
   significantly more frequently than did their non-STEM peers. Further,
   faculty who did not hold vocational teaching qualifications also adopted
   a teacher-centric approach to teaching significantly more frequently
   than did their peers who held vocational teaching qualifications.}},

Pages = {{15714-15722}},

Abstract = {{Colloidal crystals show structural colors through wavelength-selective
   diffraction at photonic stopbands. Here, we design photonic Janus balls
   with a controlled magnetic moment for programmable structural color
   switching. The Janus balls are produced from microfluidically produced
   paired drops of two distinct photocurable resins. The lighter resin
   contains magnetic nanoparticles and carbon black, whereas heavier one
   contains silica particles at a high volume fraction. The paired drops
   spontaneously align vertically due to the density asymmetry. The
   magnetic moment is assigned in the vertically aligned drops by aligning
   magnetic nanoparticles with an external field and capturing them through
   photopolymerization. Silica particles in the heavier compartment
   spontaneously form crystalline arrays due to interparticle repulsion,
   developing structural colors. The resulting photonic Janus balls
   vertically align without an external field, like a roly-poly toy, so
   that carbon-black-laden compartments face upward. With an external
   magnetic field, the Janus balls align their magnetic moment to the field
   and display structural colors. Importantly, the direction of the
   magnetic moment is set by the direction of the external field during
   photopolymerization, which enables the simultaneous manipulation of
   orientations of distinct photonic Janus balls in a programmed manner.
   These photonic Janus balls are potentially useful as active color inks
   for anti-counterfeiting tags.}},

Title = {{Physio- and Occupational Therapists View of the Place of Play in
   Re/habilitation: A Swedish Perspective}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISABILITY DEVELOPMENT AND EDUCATION}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this Swedish study was to explore and describe
   physiotherapists and occupational therapists' attitudes and
   understanding of the place of play in habilitation. This was a
   qualitative study, using semi-structured interviews exploring ten
   habilitation professional's experiences and attitude towards play.
   Interviews were analysed using content analysis. The analysis of the
   interviews resulted in four categories (1) Play in the present or
   exercise for the future (2) Play is a useful tool (3) Play needs
   different prerequisites (4) Play is a shared responsibility. The
   categories represent the professional's attitudes and understanding of
   play in habilitation. Results demonstrated that enabling play for the
   sake of play was a low priority in habilitation, despite the
   acknowledgement that it is a primary concern for children. The
   professionals focus was mainly on interventions that were remedial:
   about doing the right thing for the physical body and preparing the
   child for his/her life as an adult. There is a need to change
   perspective and incorporate interventions aimed at childhood as well as
   adulthood. Habilitation professionals need to reframe their anxiety for
   the future child and reconsider the place of play in practice.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The aim of this study is to investigate the presence and
   prevalence of BRAF V600E mutation in ameloblastomas using anti-BRAF
   V600E monoclonal antibody (VE1 clone) and to identify any
   clinicopathologic correlation with BRAF V600E mutation in ameloblastoma.
   Materials and methods The pathology files of the Department of Oral
   Pathology and Oral Medicine, Faculty of Dentistry, Lagos State
   University College of Medicine, Lagos, Nigeria, were searched for the
   diagnosis of ameloblastoma from 2016 to 2020. Archived non-decalcified
   formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue underwent immunohistochemistry
   using anti-BRAF V600E antibody at the University of Pittsburgh,
   Pennsylvania. Clinicopathologic data such as age at diagnosis, gender,
   jaw bone involved (mandible or maxilla), tumor location (anterior or
   posterior) and histologic subtype were collected. The clinicopathologic
   parameters were analyzed using Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test
   according to the BRAF status. Results Forty-four cases of ameloblastoma
   were retrieved. The male to female ratio was 1.32:1. The average age of
   patients at diagnosis was 33.3 years. Thirty-nine cases were located in
   the mandible and 5 cases in the maxilla. Only cases in the mandible were
   positive for anti-BRAF V600E antibody (n = 15/39; 38.5\%). There was a
   significant correlation between BRAF V600E expression in mandibular
   tumors and histologic subtype (p = 0.02); however, no significance was
   observed for gender, age and tumor location. Conclusion BRAF V600E
   mutation preferentially occurs in mandibular ameloblastomas, especially
   in non-plexiform ameloblastomas. These patients may benefit
   therapeutically from the use of BRAF inhibitors.}},

Title = {{Effectiveness of a video-based education on fertility awareness: a
   randomized controlled trial with partnered women}},
Journal = {{HUMAN FERTILITY}},
Abstract = {{Fertility awareness (FA) among young people is low. Fertility awareness
   interventions have been found to contribute to increase FA in the
   short-term. The long-term effectiveness of FA interventions on childless
   and presumed fertile people, committed in a heterosexual relationship
   and wishing to have children in the near future is not known. In a
   double-blind parallel randomized controlled trial conducted between 2016
   and 2018, 652 childless partnered women were randomized to either watch
   a 5-min video about fertility (IG: `Intervention Group') or to not
   receive any intervention (CG: `Control Group'). Participants filled out
   an online questionnaire at the start of the study (and in the IG group
   immediately before intervention). They then completed the questionnaire
   after 1 month, 6 months and 1 year. The questionnaire assessed FA and
   intentions to adopt fertility-protective behaviours. In the IG, FA
   levels were found to increase at 1 month post-intervention. However,
   significant interaction effects between group and time were only found
   for four out of the seven FA variables at the 6-month and 1-year
   follow-up. No effects were found for: (i) intentions to adopt
   fertility-protective behaviours; or (ii) desired timing of pregnancy.
   These results suggest that the fertility video intervention seems to
   partially increase FA in the long term. Future studies should
   investigate the effectiveness of different intervention formats with a
   focus on overcoming high attrition rates.}},

Abstract = {{The Alternative for Germany party (AfD) has been more successful
   electorally in eastern than in western Germany. In this paper, we look
   at nativism coupled with populist attitudes as possible contributors to
   the 2017 federal electoral outcome. We compare two alternative
   mechanisms for the varying election results, the first being whether
   individuals living in eastern Germany are, on average, more nativist and
   populist inclined; the second, whether nativism and populism are more
   salient when these voters go to the polls. The results show that there
   indeed exists a slightly higher level of nativist and populist sentiment
   among the east German citizens than among the west Germans. This
   difference concerns older east Germans in particular, who were
   politically socialised during the German separation. Furthermore,
   elements of nativist and populist ideas explain electoral support for
   the AfD in both parts of the country, but nativism appears to be more
   relevant in the east. Overall, the analysis of the short-term campaign
   panel data from the German Longitudinal Election Study suggests that the
   inspected ideational foundations contribute to the east-west gap in AfD
   support without accounting for it completely.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate effectiveness of positive expiratory pressure
   blow-bottle device compared to expiratory positive airway pressure and
   conventional physiotherapy on pulmonary function in postoperative
   cardiac surgery patients in intensive care unit.
   Design: A randomized controlled trial.
   Settings: Tertiary care.
   Subjects: 48 patients (16 in each group; aged 64.5 +/- 9.1 years, 38
   male) submitted to cardiac surgery.
   Interventions: Patients were randomized into conventional physiotherapy
   (G1), positive expiratory pressure blow-bottle device (G2) or expiratory
   positive airway pressure, both associated with conventional
   physiotherapy (G3). G2 and G3 performed three sets of 10 repetitions in
   each session for each technique.
   Main measures: Pulmonary function (primary); respiratory muscle
   strength, radiological changes, pulmonary complications, length of
   intensive care unit and hospital stay (secondary) assessed
   preoperatively and on the 3rd postoperative day.
   Results: Pulmonary function (except for forced expiratory volume in one
   second/ forced vital capacity \% predicted) and respiratory muscle
   strength showed significant reduction from the preoperative to the 3rd
   postoperative in all groups (P < 0.001), with no difference between
   groups (P > 0.05). Regarding radiological changes, length of intensive
   care unit stay and length of hospital stay, there was no significant
   difference between groups (P > 0.05).
   Conclusion: Both positive expiratory pressure techniques associated with
   conventional physiotherapy were similar, but there was no difference
   regarding the use of positive expiratory pressure compared to
   conventional physiotherapy.}},

   changes in female genital mutilation/cutting in Somaliland}},
Journal = {{HEALTH CARE FOR WOMEN INTERNATIONAL}},
Abstract = {{The authors' aim was to examine if the nature of female genital
   mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) in Somaliland is changing and any
   contributing factors. In this mixed method qualitative study the
   researchers used 24 focus groups, 20 key informant interviews and 28
   in-depth interviews with multiple stakeholders. We found a shift from
   the pharaonic to Sunna cut, an age decrease at which FGM/C is performed
   and an increase in its medicalization. Shift in cut type and
   medicalization appears to be partly a response to the medical narrative
   of anti-FGM/C campaigns, partly an intertwining of messaging regarding
   health risks and religious norms. We recommend a need to consider
   programs that reflect upon the utility and appropriateness of moving the
   dominant narrative to issues around the right to bodily integrity and
   bodily autonomy, and melding that messaging with the Islamic discourse
   on protecting health that focuses on collective welfare.}},

Abstract = {{The highly active and selective synthesis of polysulfites from sulfur
   dioxide (SO2) and epoxides is challenging because of the side reactions
   of the copolymerization process which produce cyclic sulfite esters
   or/and polyether or ether linkages incorporating into the copolymer.
   Herein, we report a novel approach to the synthesis of well-defined
   polysulfites through the alternating copolymerization of SO2 and
   epoxides catalyzed by simple organic ammonium salts under mild
   conditions. Both the cation and anion have strong effects on the
   catalytic activity and product selectivity. PPN-X (PPN =
   bis(triphenylphosphine)iminium; X = Cl, OAc, or 2,4-dinitrophenoxide)
   salts containing a bulky cation efficiently mediated this
   copolymerization at ambient temperature and under 1 atm SO2 pressure,
   yielding polysulfites with a high sulfite unit content, controlled
   molecular weight, and narrow polydispersity. In situ H-1 NMR studies
   suggested that a weak bonding interaction exists between cyclohexene
   oxide and SO2, in which SO2 acts as a Lewis acid and promotes epoxide
   activation. The sulfur-containing polymers are facilely synthesized from
   the readily available monomers, and their metal-free residues make such
   polymers suitable for applications in biological and electronic fields.}},

Abstract = {{To better understand the writing skills of juvenile offenders and the
   components of their writing abilities, this study explored extant data
   from six measures of adolescents' writing skills administered upon their
   entrance into a juvenile justice facility. Overall, the 235 students
   (ages 13-16; Grades 5-11) exhibited low scores on all writing measures,
   but there was a wide range in their performance with some students
   scoring at or near ceiling. A confirmatory factor analysis supported our
   hypothesis of a two-factor structure consisting of sentence-level and
   discourse-level skills. We compared the fit of three alternative models:
   a one-factor model, a higher-order model, and a bifactor model. None of
   the alternative models was superior to the two-factor model. These
   factors provide empirical support for certain aspects of traditional
   writing models and suggest a framework for efficiently assessing
   students to inform instruction.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{644}},
Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{Context. Cyanoacetamide is a -CN bearing molecule that is also an amide
   derivative target molecule in the interstellar medium.Aims. The aim of
   our investigation is to analyze the feasibility of a plausible formation
   process of protonated cyanoacetamide under interstellar conditions and
   to provide direct experimental frequencies of the ground vibrational
   state of the neutral form in the microwave region in order to enable its
   eventual identification in the interstellar medium.Methods. We used
   high-level theoretical computations to study the formation process of
   protonated cyanoacetamide. Furthermore, we employed a high-resolution
   laser-ablation molecular beam Fourier transform spectroscopic technique
   to measure the frequencies of the neutral form.Results. We report the
   first rotational characterization of cyanoacetamide, and a precise set
   of the relevant rotational spectroscopic constants have been determined
   as a first step to identifying the molecule in the interstellar medium.
   We fully explored the potential energy surface to study a gas-phase
   reaction on the formation process of protonated cyanoacetamide. We found
   that an exothermic process with no net activation barrier is initiated
   by the high-energy isomer of protonated hydroxylamine, which leads to
   protonated cyanoacetamide.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The application of neuro-endoscopes in cerebral aneurysm
   surgery may help to avoid unintended aneurysm remnants and the
   accidental clipping of perforating arteries and aid the detection of
   blood collecting in the subdural spaces. Here, we present our experience
   with the novel endoscopic micro-inspection tool QEVO (R) (Carl Zeiss
   Meditec, Germany) in aneurysm surgery.
   Materials and Equipment: In all patients the surgical microscope KINEVO
   (R) (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Germany) and the Microinspection tool QEVO (R)
   were applied.
   Methods: The case series comprises 22 unruptured cerebral aneurysms of
   the anterior circulation. All aneurysms were treated surgically. All
   patients routinely underwent computed tomography and digital subtraction
   angiography within 10 days after surgery.
   Results: No aneurysm remnants, cerebral ischemic deficits, or subdural
   hematomas were detected.
   Discussion: In this technical note, we discuss the benefits and
   limitations of the QEVO (R) tool and illustrate the major paradigms by
   means of intraoperative photographs.}},

Abstract = {{Cassini mapping of Saturn's mid-sized icy moons of well-preserved
   complex craters in the 45-95 km size range provides insight into
   cratering processes at lower surface gravity and on icy targets. These
   craters are characterized by steep rim scarps, rugged hummocky floor
   deposits of curvilinear ridges and scarps, and rugged conical central
   peaks. Ponded impact melt or related deposits are not observed on any
   floor or ejecta units of any of these complex craters, indicating that
   melt production may be much lower than predicted. Mantling ejecta units
   drape over pre-existing topography, grading into concentric zones of
   secondary craters at similar to 1 crater diameter from the rim,
   demonstrating that secondaries occur on mid-sized icy planetary bodies.
   The largest and youngest bright-ray system is the 49 km central peak
   crater Inktomi, target of a mapping campaign down to 34 m pixel scales.
   In addition to classical secondary craters up to 3 km, several hundred
   small craters <1 km in size form an unusual densely spaced cluster
   across the eastern floor and ejecta deposit. The terrain-indiscriminate
   distribution of these eastern floor craters indicates they are not
   explosive volatile release pits, such as mapped on Vesta or Mars, but
   self-secondary craters formed by the fallback of ejected blocks back
   into the crater itself during crater formation. Self-secondaries likely
   formed by an irregular and stochastic but poorly understood impact
   process, such as spallation influenced by irregular surface topography.
   Self-secondary craters of this type could influence the interpretation
   of crater counts on large fresh impact craters and basins elsewhere.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{Background
   The viral load and tissue distribution of severe acute respiratory
   syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remain important questions. The
   current study investigated SARS-CoV-2 viral load, biodistribution and
   anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody formation in patients suffering from severe
   corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) induced acute respiratory distress
   syndrome (ARDS).
   Methods
   This is a retrospective single-center study in 23 patients with
   COVID-19-induced ARDS. Data were collected within routine intensive
   care. SARS-CoV-2 viral load was assessed via reverse transcription
   quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Overall, 478 virology
   samples were taken. Anti-SARS-CoV-2-Spike-receptor binding domain (RBD)
   antibody detection of blood samples was performed with an enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay.
   Results
   Most patients (91\%) suffered from severe ARDS during ICU treatment with
   a 30-day mortality of 30\%. None of the patients received antiviral
   treatment. Tracheal aspirates tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in 100\% of
   the cases, oropharyngeal swabs only in 77\%. Blood samples were positive
   in 26\% of the patients. No difference of viral load was found in
   tracheal or blood samples with regard to 30-day survival or disease
   severity. SARS-CoV-2 was never found in dialysate. Serologic testing
   revealed significantly lower concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing
   IgM and IgA antibodies in survivors compared to non-survivors (p =
   0.009).
   Conclusions
   COVID-19 induced ARDS is accompanied by a high viral load of SARS-CoV-2
   in tracheal aspirates, which remained detectable in the majority
   throughout intensive care treatment. Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was
   never detected in dialysate even in patients with RNAemia. Viral load or
   the buildup of neutralizing antibodies was not associated with 30-day
   survival or disease severity.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The short-circuit current (J(sc)) of organic solar cells is defined by
   the interplay of exciton photogeneration in the active layer, geminate
   and non-geminate recombination losses and free charge carrier
   extraction. The method proposed in this work allows the quantification
   of geminate recombination and the determination of the mobility-lifetime
   product (mu tau) as a single integrated parameter for charge transport
   and non-geminate recombination. Furthermore, the extraction efficiency
   is quantified based on the obtained mu tau product. Only readily
   available experimental methods (current-voltage characteristics,
   external quantum efficiency measurements) are employed, which are
   coupled with an optical transfer matrix method simulation. The required
   optical properties of common organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials are
   provided in this work. The new approach is applied to three OPV systems
   in inverted or conventional device structures, and the results are
   juxtaposed against the mu tau values obtained by an independent method
   based on the voltage-capacitance spectroscopy technique. Furthermore, it
   is demonstrated that the new method can accurately predict the optimal
   active layer thickness.}},

Title = {{Mitochondrial Ca2+ Signaling Is an Electrometabolic Switch to Fuel
   Phagosome Killing}},
Journal = {{CELL REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{Phagocytes reallocate metabolic resources to kill engulfed pathogens,
   but the intracellular signals that rapidly switch the immunometabolic
   program necessary to fuel microbial killing are not understood. We
   report that macrophages use a fast two-step Ca2+ relay to meet the
   bioenergetic demands of phagosomal killing. Upon detection of a fungal
   pathogen, macrophages rapidly elevate cytosolic Ca2+ (phase 1), and by
   concurrently activating the mitochondrial Ca2+ (mCa(2+)) uniporter
   (MCU), they trigger a rapid influx of Ca2+ into the mitochondria (phase
   2). mCa(2+) signaling reprograms mitochondrial metabolism, at least in
   part, through the activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). Deprived
   of mCa(2+) signaling, Mcu(-/-) macrophages are deficient in phagosomal
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and defective at killing fungi.
   Mice lacking MCU in their myeloid cells are highly susceptible to
   disseminated candidiasis. In essence, this study reveals an elegant
   design principle that MCU-dependent Ca2+ signaling is an
   electrometabolic switch to fuel phagosome killing.}},

Abstract = {{Fabricating the significant electrocatalysts with enriched activity and
   stability is necessary due to the increasing demands of the fuel cell
   industries for its commercialization. This report provides a widespread
   impact on fabrication of a suitable and significant porous bimetallic
   nanocatalyst for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). Here, we have
   developed nanofoams of Cu-Co alloys/oxides with varied carbon supports
   using simple combustion method, where graphite oxide (GO) shows
   synergistic ``catalyst-support{''} effect than other substrates. The
   morphological studies reveal a honeycomb-like structure with dense
   porous nature of Cu-Co nanofoam (CuCo@rGO). X-ray diffraction and
   spectroscopic studies reveal the formation of spinel structure of
   CuCo2O4 with active \{110\} facets in case of CuCo@rGO, exhibiting
   higher methanol electrooxidation activity of 198 mA/cm(2), which is
   found to be improved than that of the previous reports. The optimized
   composition, CuCo@rGO shows the slow decrease in the current in
   chronoamperometric studies with 40\% retention of its activity even
   after 10 hours. The CoCu@rGO nanofoam shows improved
   Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area of similar to 50 m(2)/g due to the
   addition of GO. In addition, the composite shows an excellent
   electrochemical surface area value of 7.75 m(2)/g over other
   compositions of different carbon supports. The intrinsic effect of
   better conductivity of Co75Cu25@rGO has also been confirmed using
   impedance spectroscopy. The porous honeycomb structure of Co75Cu25@rGO
   composite synergistically impacts methanol oxidation and also forbids
   the formation of CO intermediate, maintaining the activity.}},

Abstract = {{The ecosystems of hypersaline waters are characterized by the simplified
   trophic webs with the `loss' of predators. In the absence of predators,
   their role can be effectively performed by omnivorous as Gammaridae
   species. In Lake Moynaki, a small hypersaline lake, Gammarus aequicauda
   is one of the most abundant animal species along with chironomid larvae
   Baeotendipes noctivagus. Both these species are promising objects to use
   in polyaquaculture, and this adds an importance to know their trophic
   relations. To analyse G. aequicauda feeding on B. noctivagus, the field
   and experimental studies were conducted in 2018 and 2019. In two
   habitats (Ruppia thickets and free water), the abundance of both species
   significantly differed, and in the thickets of Ruppia, the Gammarus
   abundance was higher, and of chironomid larvae was less. Taking into
   account our experimental results and chironomid larvae abundance in the
   lake during the study period (from 460 to 3,200 ind./m(2)), the authors
   conclude that larvae abundance did not limit the rate of their
   consumption in the lake by G. aequicauda, and one can consume up to 4
   larvae per day. Thus, G. aequicauda could receive a diet of about 45\%
   of their weight consuming about 2\% of the available larvae daily in
   areas without the marine grass Ruppia thickets. In Ruppia thickets,
   chironomid larvae are not important food of G. aequicauda because the
   Ruppia leaves play a more important role in gammarid diet. With
   sufficient plant food resources, G. aequicauda can be successfully
   cultivated together with chironomid larvae.}},

Abstract = {{In this research, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model is
   formulated to design cellular manufacturing systems (CMSs) in multiple
   plants in a dynamic condition. The proposed mathematical model
   integrates significant manufacturing characteristics in designing CMSs
   along with the main strategies of production planning (PP) and
   location-allocation (LA) problems. In addition, there are some novel
   characteristics that make the designed model remarkable regarding the
   literature including: (1) multi-plant location; (2) allocation of plants
   capacity to fulfill multiple markets demand; and (3) the integration of
   dynamic cell formation, PP and LA decisions. The objective function
   terms are to optimize the sale revenue and total costs of machine
   operating, machine overhead, inter-cell material handling, inventory
   holding, outsourcing, machine installation/uninstallation, products
   transportation, dispersing machines, establishing plants, and forming
   cells. A sample test problem is solved by CPLEX solver to show the
   achievement obtained by the characteristics incorporated into the model.
   Since the proposed model is NP-hard, two meta-heuristics algorithms as
   grey wolf optimization and genetic algorithm are developed. To verify
   the computational effectiveness of the employed meta-heuristics in
   comparison with that of CPLEX solver, its performance is tested using a
   number of test problems.}},

   CPO (10 mg/kg) did not affect locomotor capacity in the open-field and

   CPO inhibited 90 +/- 7\%, the pain in the mechanical hyperalgesia test.
   In the tail-flick test, CPO at 3 mg/kg affected the tail-flick latencies
   in mice by 77 +/- 20\%, which in combination with naloxone was only
   partially reduced. At 3 mg/kg CPO inhibited 80 +/- 12\% the

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Epigenetic differences may help to distinguish between PTSD cases and
   trauma-exposed controls. Here, we describe the results of the largest
   DNA methylation meta-analysis of PTSD to date. Ten cohorts, military and
   civilian, contribute blood-derived DNA methylation data from 1,896 PTSD
   cases and trauma-exposed controls. Four CpG sites within the
   aryl-hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AHRR) associate with PTSD after
   adjustment for multiple comparisons, with lower DNA methylation in PTSD
   cases relative to controls. Although AHRR methylation is known to
   associate with smoking, the AHRR association with PTSD is most
   pronounced in non-smokers, suggesting the result was independent of
   smoking status. Evaluation of metabolomics data reveals that AHRR
   methylation associated with kynurenine levels, which are lower among
   subjects with PTSD. This study supports epigenetic differences in those
   with PTSD and suggests a role for decreased kynurenine as a contributor
   to immune dysregulation in PTSD. PTSD has been associated with DNA
   methylation of specific loci in the genome, but studies have been
   limited by small sample sizes. Here, the authors perform a meta-analysis
   of DNA methylation data from 10 different cohorts and identify CpGs in
   AHRR that are associated with PTSD.}},

Abstract = {{We present multiplexer methodology and hardware for nanoelectronic
   device characterization. This high-throughput and scalable approach to
   testing large arrays of nanodevices operates from room temperature to
   milli-Kelvin temperatures and is universally compatible with different
   materials and integration techniques. We demonstrate the applicability
   of our approach on two archetypal nanomaterials-graphene and
   semiconductor nanowires-integrated with a GaAs-based multiplexer using
   wet or dry transfer methods. A graphene film grown by chemical vapor
   deposition is transferred and patterned into an array of individual
   devices, achieving 94\% yield. Device performance is evaluated using
   data fitting methods to obtain electrical transport metrics, showing
   mobilities comparable to nonmultiplexed devices fabricated on oxide
   substrates using wet transfer techniques. Separate arrays of
   indium-arsenide nanowires and micromechanically exfoliated monolayer
   graphene flakes are transferred using pick-and-place techniques. For the
   nanowire array mean values for mobility mu(FE) = 880/3180 cm(2) V-1
   s(-1) (lower/upper bound), subthreshold swing 430 mV dec(-1), and on/off
   ratio 3.1 decades are extracted, similar to nonmultiplexed devices. In
   another array, eight mechanically exfoliated graphene flakes are
   transferred using techniques compatible with fabrication of
   two-dimensional superlattices, with 75\% yield. Our results are a
   proof-of-concept demonstration of a versatile platform for scalable
   fabrication and cryogenic characterization of nanomaterial device
   arrays, which is compatible with a broad range of nanomaterials,
   transfer techniques, and device integration strategies from the
   forefront of quantum technology research.}},

Abstract = {{The high demand of sea cucumbers in international markets, mostly based
   in Asia, has left a deep impact on the natural stock of many species,
   leading to an investment in aquaculture techniques in order to mitigate
   these impacts. This study aimed to determine the effects of stock
   density in rearing broodstock of Holothuria (Panningoturia) forskali
   Delle Chiaje, 1823, a common species in the Mediterranean Sea and
   eastern Atlantic with commercial value. To do so, two different density
   treatments were selected: 1 kg/m(2) and 2 kg/m(2). The trial took place
   over five months and individuals were fed a mixture of frozen microalgae
   (Tetraselmis sp. and Phaeodactylum tricornutum). At the end of the
   trial, the effects of stock density on the individuals' condition were
   assessed by analysing different variables, namely their fresh and gutted
   weight, evisceration and mortality rates, gonadosomatic index and oocyte
   size and even biochemical content, such as protein and lipid content in
   muscle bands. No significant differences were found between density
   treatments regarding any of the parameters assessed, aside from mean
   oocyte diameter. Individuals from the lower-density treatment presented
   a smaller mean oocyte diameter, supplied with fewer oocytes, than
   individuals in both the higher-density treatment and the baseline group.
   Regardless of this one difference, all trial individuals were able to
   maintain their elevated gonadal developmental stage for a full period of
   five months past their reproductive peak, with female holothurians
   subjected to the higher-density treatment showing signs of increasing
   vitellogenic reserves, a considerable advantage in aquaculture
   broodstock rearing.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the cold and combustion flow characteristics of a trapped
   vortex combustor with inverse diffusion combustion method have been
   studied numerically, and the effects of four jet arrangement schemes on
   the vortex structure, temperature distribution, turbulence kinetic
   energy, OH mass fraction and combustion efficiency were compared. The
   results indicate that the vortex structures in cold state are basically
   the same with a double vortex structure for all the jet schemes.
   However, when the jet holes are arranged on the after-body wall, the
   vortex changes from a double vortex structure in cold state to a single
   vortex structure in combustion state, the combustion effect is not too
   large when the jet holes are arranged on the fore-body wall. The
   high-temperature distribution in cavity is mainly concentrated in the
   upper part, but when the jet holes are arranged on the after-body wall,
   the OH mass fraction distribution is higher than that when the jet holes
   are arranged on the fore-body wall. In addition, when the jet holes are
   arranged on the fore-body wall, complete combustion can be accelerated.
   In general, when the jet holes are arranged in the same position, the
   multi-jet scheme is more conducive to flame stability in cavity and the
   improvement of combustion and mixing performance than the coaxial jet.}},

Abstract = {{While it has been taken for granted in the development of several
   automatic facial expression recognition tools, the question of the
   coherence between subjective feelings and facial expressions is still a
   subject of debate. On one hand, the ``Basic Emotion View{''} conceives
   emotions as genetically hardwired and, therefore, being genuinely
   displayed through facial expressions. Consequently, emotion recognition
   is perceiver independent. On the other hand, the constructivist approach
   conceives emotions as socially constructed, the emotional meaning of a
   facial expression being inferred by the perceiver. Hence, emotion
   recognition is perceiver dependent. In order (1) to evaluate the
   coherence between the subjective feeling of emotions and their
   spontaneous facial displays, and (2) to compare the recognition of such
   displays by human perceivers and by an automatic facial expression
   classifier, 232 videos of expressers recruited to carry out an emotion
   elicitation task were annotated by 1383 human perceivers as well as by
   Affdex, an automatic classifier. Results show a weak consistency between
   self-reported emotional states by expressers and their facial emotional
   displays. They also show low accuracy both of human perceivers and of
   the automatic classifier to infer the subjective feeling from the
   spontaneous facial expressions displayed by expressers. However, the
   results are more in favor of a perceiver-dependent view. Based on these
   results, the hypothesis of genetically hardwired emotion genuinely
   displayed is difficult to support, whereas the idea of emotion and
   facial expression as being socially constructed appears to be more
   likely. Accordingly, automatic emotion recognition tools based on facial
   expressions should be questioned.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the social behaviour of roosting insectivorous
   bats in Australia. Interactions between individuals and movements
   between multiple roosts at a building maternity site of the chocolate
   wattled bat (Chalinolobus morio) were examined using video observation
   and Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tagging, respectively. Bats of
   both sexes were seen to allogroom, which involved pairs of individuals
   simultaneously grooming each other around the face. This is the first
   occurrence of allogrooming reported between male vespertilionids,
   globally. In total, 366 bats were PIT tagged and analysis of movements
   revealed that bats exhibited a fission-fusion pattern of roost usage
   with sufficient switching among nearby roosts, such that all individuals
   were potentially able to associate and interact over a period of 150-200
   days. Rates of roost fidelity varied markedly from 1 to 7.2 days of
   continuous occupancy of roosts, with females exhibiting slightly higher
   overall levels of fidelity over the nine-month monitoring period. The
   information gained from this study, when combined with results from
   other research, provides a sufficient basis for the description of the
   apparent breeding system for this species, where both males and females
   at the summer maternity roost are natally philopatric and mating takes
   place over winter in an expanded gene pool, comprising individuals that
   have dispersed from multiple summer maternity roosts.}},

Abstract = {{Chagas disease (CD) is endemic in Latin America. Drugs available for its
   treatment are benznidazole (BZ)/nifurtimox (NF), both with low efficacy
   in the late infection and responsible for several side effects. Studies
   of new drugs for CD among natural products, and using drug combinations
   with BZ/NF are recommended. Silibinin (SLB) is a natural compound that
   inhibits the efflux pump (Pgp) of drugs in host cell membranes, causes
   death of trypanosomatids, has anti-inflammatory activity, and was never
   assayed against T. cruzi. Here, in vitro and in vivo activities of SLB,
   SLB+BZ, and BZ against T. cruzi Y strain were evaluated. Cytotoxicity of
   SLB in VERO cells by the MTT method revealed IC50 of 250.22 mu M. The
   trypanocidal activity evaluated by resazurin method in epimastigotes
   showed that SLB 25 mu M inhibited parasite growth. SLB IC50 and
   selectivity index (SI) for amastigote were 79.81 mu M and 3.13,
   respectively. SLB100+BZ10 showed higher parasite inhibition (91.44\%)
   than SLB or BZ. Swiss mice infected with Y strain were treated with SLB,
   SLB+BZ, and BZ. Parasitemia was evaluated daily and 90, 180, and 240
   days after treatment in surviving animals by hemoculture, blood qPCR,
   and after euthanasia, by qPCR in heart tissue. SLB monotherapy was not
   able to control the parasitemia/mortality of the animals.
   Parasitological negativation of 85.7-100\% was observed in the
   experimental groups treated with SLB+BZ. Although SLB had shown activity
   against T. cruzi in vitro, it was not active in mice. Thus, the results
   of the therapeutic effect observed with SLB+BZ may be interpreted as a
   result from BZ action.}},

Title = {{Variants of the Aggression-Related RBFOX1 Gene in a Population
   Representative Birth Cohort Study: Aggressiveness, Personality, and
   Alcohol Use Disorder}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: Recently, RBFOX1, a gene encoding an RNA binding protein,
   has consistently been associated with aggressive and antisocial
   behavior. Several loci in the gene have been nominally associated with
   aggression in genome-wide association studies, the risk alleles being
   more frequent in the general population. We have hence examined the
   association of four RBFOX1 single nucleotide polymorphisms, previously
   found related to aggressive traits, with aggressiveness, personality,
   and alcohol use disorder in birth cohort representative samples.
   Methods: We used both birth cohorts of the Estonian Children Personality
   Behavior and Health Study (ECPBHS; original n = 1,238). Aggressiveness
   was assessed using the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire and the
   Lifetime History of Aggressiveness structured interview at age 25
   (younger cohort) or 33 (older cohort). Big Five personality at age 25
   was measured with self-reports and the lifetime occurrence of alcohol
   use disorder assessed with the MINI interview. RBFOX1 polymorphisms
   rs809682, rs8062784, rs12921846, and rs6500744 were genotyped in all
   participants. Given the restricted size of the sample, correction for
   multiple comparisons was not applied.
   Results: Aggressiveness was not significantly associated with the RBFOX1
   genotype. RBFOX1 rs8062784 was associated with neuroticism and rs809682
   with extraversion. Two out of four analyzed RBFOX1 variants, rs8062784
   and rs12921846, were associated with the occurrence of alcohol use
   disorder.
   Conclusions: In the birth cohort representative sample of the ECPBHS, no
   association of RBFOX1 with aggressiveness was found, but RBFOX1 variants
   affected basic personality traits and the prevalence of alcohol use
   disorder. Future studies on RBFOX1 should consider the moderating role
   of personality and alcohol use patterns in aggressiveness.}},

Title = {{Managing unresolved issues of addiction during cancer treatment: A
   qualitative study about cancer care providers' representations}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   Five French oncology institutions had participated in a funded study
   aiming at implementing an Evidence-Based Practice tool (PAM-13), which
   allowed nurses to measure the level of activation of the patient to
   support his or her own empowerment in the cancer care pathway. The
   purpose of this ancillary study is to (i) describe the caregivers'
   perceptions of addictions and their management concurrently with cancer
   treatment, (ii) explore the role that Motivational Interviewing
   techniques can play.
   Methods
   15 individual semi-structured interviews of caregivers were performed,
   using the Theoretical Domains Framework for the interview guide.
   Qualitative data were analyzed inductively, in a thematic analysis. The
   COREQ guided the reporting of this qualitative study.
   Results
   Views on addictions influence the way caregivers manage patients
   suffering from unresolved issues of addiction. Care is mainly focused on
   the pathology (cancer-centered) and strictly curative. When practiced,
   Motivational Interviewing is patient-centered, fostering the patient's
   empowerment on the cancer care pathway.
   Conclusions
   The dissemination of Motivational Interviewing techniques in current
   practices in oncology, both in terms of doctors and nursing teams, would
   enable improvement to the management of addictions on the cancer care
   pathway, by deploying a patient-centered approach. This new paradigm of
   care would support the empowerment of patients enrolled in the cancer
   care pathway and promote better communication between caregivers and
   patients. Hence, a paradigm shift is essential. Motivational
   Interviewing techniques could provide a caring approach that promotes
   communication between the patient and the caregiver and also supports
   the former's empowerment. This research suggests the need to adapt the
   cancer care pathway in order to integrate the necessary care for
   patients who concomitantly suffer from unresolved addictive disorders.}},

Title = {{Gendered regulations and SME performance in transition economies}},
Journal = {{SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMICS}},
Abstract = {{This article explores the culture-regulations-gender triad in relation
   to small and medium enterprises' (SMEs') performance. Using a firm-level
   panel dataset drawn from 27 countries in Central and Eastern Europe and
   Central Asia between 2005 and 2014, we show that women and men
   experience and respond differently to regulations. Women take
   regulations very seriously and as a result, their SMEs see improved
   performance, whereas men discount the influence of regulations which
   then depresses the performance of their SMEs. However, when women
   respond to regulatory enforcers, it erodes the performance of their
   SMEs, whereas when men engage enforcers, the performance of their SMEs
   improves. The fact that women and men experience and respond to the same
   regulations differently-regardless of country effect and whether their
   SMEs are high- or low-performing businesses-suggests that regulations
   perpetuate gender biases, thus impacting not only individuals but even
   the organizations they lead. Our study expands gendered institutions
   theory by clarifying how regulations diffuse cultural values and
   influence women and men, as well as their SMEs, differently.}},

   factor analysis and omega coefficients, and (3) relationship with the
   theoretically related variables student retention, achievement, and

Title = {{Beyond Implicit Bias: Litigating Race and Gender Employment
   Discrimination Using Data from the Workplace Experiences Survey}},
Journal = {{HASTINGS LAW JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{337-464}},
Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{This Article joins other voices(1) in challenging what I will call the
   ``implicit bias consensus{''} in employment discrimination law, first
   crystallized in the work of Susan Sturm(2) and Linda Hamilton
   Krieger.(3) The implicit bias consensus has two basic components. The
   first is that most employment discrimination today is what Sturm
   christened ``second generation employment discrimination{''} caused by
   implicit bias that is uncontrollable and unconscious, subtle and
   ambiguous.(4) The second component of the consensus is that Title VII is
   ill-suited to address second generation discrimination.(5)
   This Article challenges the implicit bias consensus based on six
   different datasets from the Workplace Experiences Survey (WES), a simple
   ten-minute climate survey that provides a fine-grained description of
   how racial and gender bias play out in everyday workplace interactions.
   WES data and Williams's other research offer plaintiffs' lawyers a
   simple way to talk about racial and gender bias as falling into five
   basic patterns. WES data also helps them respond to the common defense
   argument that studies performed in social psychology labs do not
   describe what happens at work: the conjunction of lab studies and WES
   data is more powerful than either type of evidence alone, because lab
   studies provide objective evidence that the five basic patterns exist in
   the world, while WES data provide attitudinal evidence that these five
   patterns exist in today's workplaces. The Article explores the
   implications of the WES and the five-patterns model for Title VII,
   contesting some basic tenets of the implicit bias consensus, notably its
   description of bias as unconscious and uncontrollable, and the
   contention that Title VII is ill-suited to address contemporary forms of
   discrimination. The Article ends by providing a step-by-step guide to
   how to use bias evidence in litigation, highlighting evidence that will
   be useful to help plaintiffs' lawyers establish that a reasonable jury
   could find bias, particularly in light of the relaxed causation standard
   articulated in Bostock v. Clayton County.(6)}},

Title = {{Evidence-Based Practices in Community Corrections: Officers' Perceptions
   of Professional Relevance and Personal Competence}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE}},
Abstract = {{While the broad goals of U.S. probation and parole agencies have shifted
   over time, many departments have recently begun to implement
   evidence-based practices (EBPs) in supervision. Adoption of EBPs,
   however, requires the support and active participation of line-level
   officers. To explore officers' perceptions of both traditional and EBP
   supervision measures, we surveyed probation and parole officers in seven
   community corrections departments across five states. Our analyses
   suggest that officers identify both traditional and EBP measures as
   relevant to their jobs, and officers generally feel very confident in
   their abilities to incorporate traditional and EBP measures into their
   supervision approaches. Moreover, several individual and work-related
   variables are associated with officers' perceived competencies for
   several EBP and traditional measures. Further, officers tend to feel
   confident with multiple supervision techniques and do not separate into
   camps that favor traditional versus evidence-based practices. We discuss
   policy implications of these findings and directions for future
   research.}},

Abstract = {{Infection is one of the primary causes of death from immune
   thrombocytopenia (ITP), and the lungs are the most common site of
   infection. We identified the factors associated with hospitalization for
   community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in nonsplenectomized adults with ITP
   and established the anti-citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA)
   prediction model to predict the incidence of hospitalization for CAP.
   This was a retrospective study of nonsplenectomized adult patients with
   ITP from 10 large medical centers in China. The derivation cohort
   included 145 ITP inpatients with CAP and 1360 inpatients without CAP
   from 5 medical centers, and the validation cohort included the remaining
   63 ITP inpatients with CAP and 526 inpatients without CAP from the other
   5 centers. The 4-item ACPA model, which included age, Charlson
   Comorbidity Index score, initial platelet count, and initial absolute
   lymphocyte count, was established by multivariable analysis of the
   derivation cohort. Internal and external validation were conducted to
   assess the performance of the model. The ACPA model had an area under
   the curve of 0.853 (95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 0.818-0.889) in the
   derivation cohort and 0.862 (95\% CI, 0.807-0.916) in the validation
   cohort, which indicated the good discrimination power of the model.
   Calibration plots showed high agreement between the estimated and
   observed probabilities. Decision curve analysis indicated that ITP
   patients could benefit from the clinical application of the ACPA model.
   To summarize, the ACPA model was developed and validated to predict the
   occurrence of hospitalization for CAP, which might help identify ITP
   patients with a high risk of hospitalization for CAP.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, good energy storage properties are obtained via enhancing
   dielectric breakdown strength (DBS) in transparent ErBiO3 (EB)-doped
   (K0.5Na0.5)NbO3 (KNN-xEB) ceramics. The doping of EB makes a strong
   impact on the grain size and densities of KNN-based ceramics, which
   decreases the average grain size and enhances the densities
   significantly. A gradual transformation of crystal structures from
   orthorhombic to pseudocubic occurs via EB modification. Rietveld
   refinement is carried out to further investigate the influence of doped
   EB on the crystal structure, especially on the distortion degree of the
   pseudocubic phase. The domain structures change from irregular
   macroscopic and lamellar domains to nanodomains because of the donor
   doping of EB. The contribution of the second phase to DBS is also
   confirmed through first-principles calculation on the basis of density
   functional theory (DFT). The energy storage properties are also
   investigated with an energy storage density of W similar to 2.68 J/cm(3)
   and a recoverable energy storage density of W-rec similar to 1.85
   J/cm(3) for the KNN-0.015EB ceramic, which also present a good thermal
   stability. The results imply that the KNN-xEB ceramics have huge
   potential for optical and energy storage applications as multifunctional
   materials.}},

Abstract = {{Controlling spintronic properties of ferromagnetic metal/organic
   interfaces in a reversible manner provides novel avenues in spin memory
   and logic operations. Until now, most previous work has been performed
   by adsorbing magnetic organometallic complexes with bistable magnetic
   states on metal surfaces. However, the strong coupling between the
   molecule and metal surface usually destroys the switching ability or
   even leads to dissociation of the adsorbates, obstructing efficient
   control of spintronic properties at the interface. Here, we propose a
   new design to realize the switchable magnetic properties based on
   bistable chemisorbed and physisorbed states of nonmagnetic molecules on
   ferromagnetic metal surfaces. The switching between the two states leads
   to distinct local magnetic moments and yields actively controlled spin
   polarization of the tunneling current. Based on this strategy, we have
   predicted a series of switchable spinterfaces from halogenated aromatic
   hydrocarbons on ferromagnetic metal surfaces, allowing highly tunable
   interfacial spintronic properties.}},

Abstract = {{Background/aims In clinical trials, the primary outcome is often a
   composite endpoint defined as time to the first occurrence of either
   death or certain non-fatal events. Thus, a portion of available data
   would be omitted. In the win ratio approach, priorities are given to the
   clinically more important events, and more data are used. However, its
   power may be low if the treatment effect is predominantly on the
   non-terminal event.
   Methods We propose event-specific win ratios obtained separately on the
   terminal and non-terminal events. They can then be used to form global
   tests such as a linear combination test, the maximum test, or a chi(2)
   test.
   Results In simulations, these tests often improve the power of the
   original win ratio test. Furthermore, when the terminal and non-terminal
   events experience differential treatment effects, the new tests are
   often more powerful than the log-rank test for the composite outcome.
   Whether the treatment effect is primarily on the terminal events or not,
   the new tests based on the event-specific win ratios can be useful when
   different types of events are present. The new tests can reject the null
   hypothesis of no difference in the event distributions in the two
   treatment arms with the terminal event showing detrimental effect and
   the non-terminal event showing beneficial effect. The maximum test and
   the chi(2) test do not have test-estimation coherency, but the maximum
   test has the coherency that the global null is rejected if and only if
   the null for one of the event types is rejected. When applied to data
   from the trial Aldosterone Antagonist Therapy for Adults With Heart
   Failure and Preserved Systolic Function (TOPCAT), the new tests all
   reject the null hypothesis of no treatment effect while both the
   log-rank test used in TOPCAT and the original win ratio approach show
   non-significant p-values.
   Conclusion Whether the treatment effect is primarily on the terminal
   events or the non-terminal events, the maximum test based on the
   event-specific win ratios can be a useful alternative for testing
   treatment effect in clinical trials with time-to-event outcomes when
   different types of events are present.}},

Title = {{Dynamic Multiobjective Optimization with Multiple Response Strategies
   Based on Linear Environment Detection}},
Journal = {{COMPLEXITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{Dynamic multiobjective optimization problems (DMOPs) bring more
   challenges for multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) due to its
   time-varying characteristic. To handle this kind of DMOPs, this paper
   presents a dynamic MOEA with multiple response strategies based on
   linear environment detection, called DMOEA-LEM. In this approach,
   different types of environmental changes are estimated and then the
   corresponding response strategies are activated to generate an efficient
   initial population for the new environment. DMOEA-LEM not only detects
   whether the environmental changes but also estimates the types of linear
   changes so that different prediction models can be selected to
   initialize the population when the environmental changes. To study the
   performance of DMOEA-LEM, a large number of test DMOPs are adopted and
   the experiments validate the advantages of our algorithm when compared
   to three state-of-the-art dynamic MOEAs.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{125}},
Number = {{22}},
Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{Chern insulator ferromagnets are characterized by a quantized anomalous
   Hall effect and have so far been identified experimentally in
   magnetically doped topological insulator thin films and in bilayer
   graphene moire superlattices. We classify Chern insulator ferromagnets
   as either spin or orbital, depending on whether the orbital
   magnetization results from spontaneous spin polarization combined with
   spin-orbit interactions, as in the magnetically doped topological
   insulator case, or directly from spontaneous orbital currents, as in the
   moire superlattice case. We argue that, in a given magnetic state,
   characterized, for example, by the sign of the anomalous Hall effect,
   the magnetization of an orbital Chern insulator will often have opposite
   signs for weak n and weak p electrostatic or chemical doping. This
   property enables pure electrical switching of a magnetic state in the
   presence of a fixed magnetic field.}},

   datasets from human, mice, cow and pig, and evaluated the relation
   between their abundances and sperm quality traits. In our analysis, we
   identified 283 382 piRNAs, 1355 of which correlated with P <= 0.01 to at
   least one semen quality trait. Fifty-seven percent of the correlated
   piRNAs mapped less than 50 kb apart from any other piRNA in the pig
   genome. Furthermore, piRNA location was significantly enriched near long

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE \& DYNAMICS}},
Abstract = {{The increasing problem of multi-drug resistant-tuberculosis has focused
   attention on developing new drugs that are not only active against
   drug-resistant tuberculosis, but also shorten the lengthy therapy.
   Therefore, this work employs the application of modeling technique to
   predict the inhibition activities of some prominent compounds which been
   reported to be efficient against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. To
   accomplish the purpose of this work, multiple regression and genetic
   function approximation were adopted to create the model. The established
   model was swayed with topological descriptors; MATS7s, SpMin4\_Bhv,
   TDB3v and RDF70v. More also, interactions between the compounds and the
   target protein `DNA gyrase' were evaluated via molecular docking
   approach utilizing the PyRx and discovery studio simulation software.
   Based on the docking analysis, compound 20 has the most noticeable
   binding affinity of -16.5 kcal/mol. Therefore, compound 20 served as a
   reference structural template and insight to design fourteen novel
   hypothetical agents with more prominent anti-tubercular activities. More
   also, compound 20j was observed with the highest activity among the
   designed compounds with a prominent binding affinity of -24.3 kcal/mol.
   Therefore, this research recommends in-vivo, in-vitro screening and
   pharmacokinetic properties to be carried out in order to determine the
   toxicity of the designed compounds.

Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a novel biomarker of
   neurodegenerative diseases. It is detectable in the peripheral blood,
   allowing low-invasive assessment of early signs of neurodegeneration.
   The level of NfL gradually increases with age; however, what other
   factors affect it remains unclear. The present study examined the
   association between blood NfL level and renal function among healthy
   participants undergoing a health check (n=43, serum NfL) and patients
   with diabetes mellitus (n=188, plasma NfL). All participants were 60
   years of age or older; none were diagnosed with dementia. In each group,
   levels of blood NfL and serum creatinine significantly correlated
   (coefficient r=0.50, 0.56). These associations remained statistically
   significant even after adjustment for age, sex, and body mass index.
   These findings indicate that blood NfL level might be partially affected
   by renal function. We recommend measuring renal function for a more
   precise evaluation of neuroaxonal damage, in particular, among older
   adults.}},

   mandate early treatment. Few instances of survival to asymptomatic
   middle-age patients have been reported, and they are decreasing due to
   early detection. We reported a case of a middle-aged man who was
   asymptomatic during his life and recently diagnosed with ToF. The
   patient underwent surgical repair with excellent outcomes. The case
   represents the possibility of diagnosing such cases in a relatively old
   patient despite medical development and advances.}},

Title = {{Risk Factors and Predictors of Rebound Hyperbilirubinemia in a Term and
   Late-Preterm Infant with Hemolysis}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Objective This study aimed to assess the incidence and predictors of
   rebound in term and late-preterm infants with hemolytic
   hyperbilirubinemia postphototherapy.
   Study Design A 4-year retrospective data analysis of neonates with
   hemolytic indirect hyperbilirubinemia admitted to the neonatal intensive
   care unit (NICU) of Medina Maternity and Children's Hospital was
   conducted. Bilirubin rebound was defined as the return of total serum
   bilirubin (TSB) to phototherapy threshold within 72 hours of
   postphototherapy.
   Results Of 386 identified neonates; 44 (11\%) experienced rebound.
   Neonates in the rebound group demonstrated significantly higher levels
   of peak TSB, TSB at discontinuation of phototherapy, and lower value of
   relative TSB (difference between TSB at phototherapy termination and the
   American Academy of Pediatrics {[}AAP] threshold for phototherapy at
   concurrent age) compared with nonrebound group ( p -value: <0.001,
   <0.001, and 0.007, respectively). Lower value of relative TSB at
   stoppage of phototherapy was the single independent predictor for
   rebound hyperbilirubinemia by mutivariate regression ( p < 0.001). A
   cut-off value for relative TSB at stoppage of phototherapy of 190 mu
   mol/L had 98\% sensitivity and 32\% specificity to predict rebound
   hyperbilirubinemia.
   Conclusion Relative TSB at phototherapy termination is the best
   predictor for postphototherapy rebound hyperbilirubinemia in neonates
   with hemolytic etiology.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   Human brucellosis is a prevalent zoonotic disease. It can be transmitted
   by exposure to an infected animal, and by consumption of contaminated
   milk and dairy products. Saudi Arabia is considered as an endemic area
   for human brucellosis. We wanted to assess the knowledge and practice of
   primary health care physicians with regard to diagnosis, treatment, and
   prevention of brucellosis.
   METHODS
   This study included 124 primary care physicians in Prince Sultan
   Military City in Riyadh from March 2016 to August 2017. A survey was
   used to assess knowledge and practice on human brucellosis that included
   three sections - Section A to investigate demographics, Section B to
   assess knowledge, and Section C to assess practice. Validity of the
   questionnaire was proved, and the reliability was found to be 84.1 \%
   and response rate 86.7 \%.
   RESULTS
   Good knowledge of human brucellosis was found in general, and
   consultants have the higher level of knowledge in comparison to freshly
   graduated physicians, and general practitioners. Long experience has a
   positive relationship with knowledge and practice with regard to human
   brucellosis.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Lack of knowledge and practice of primary care physicians, general
   practitioners, and freshly graduated physicians, on human brucellosis
   could be among the contributing factors to under-diagnosis and
   under-reporting of brucellosis cases in primary health care centres in
   Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. There is a demand for refresher programs, and
   lectures among physicians. Their teaching curricula should lay more
   emphasis on brucellosis.}},

Abstract = {{Anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) has been widely used for the
   detection of several heavy metal ions in neutral and acidic solution, in
   many cases employing electrodes and/or solutions incorporating Bi. In
   this work we demonstrate that Bi(OH)(4)(-) ion concentration can be
   measured in highly alkaline 8.5 M KOH solution using ASV. The addition
   of Pb in similar concentrations to the Bi(OH)(4)(-) being measured is
   shown to improve both the sensitivity and precision of the method. When
   the Pb additive is employed, a formal limit of detection of 8.5 ppb is
   achieved, compared to 17.3 ppb when the Pb additive is not used. Due to
   the use of Bi additives in alkaline battery chemistries, it follows that
   separators which limit Bi(OH)(4)(-) diffusion into the bulk electrolyte
   and away from the electrodes are of interest. For this purpose, we
   utilize ASV to determine Bi(OH)(4)(-) diffusion rates through Celgard
   3501, cellophane 350P00, and Nafion 211. Bi(OH)(4)(-) crossover rates,
   as determined by ASV, are shown to be repeatable and consistent with
   expectations from the known separator structure.}},

   a range of role-play settings. The dialogues are accompanied by
   fine-grained sentence-level judgments of MT quality, produced by the
   dialogue participants themselves, as well as by manually normalised
   versions and reference translations produced a posteriori. The
   motivation for the corpus is twofold: to provide (i) a unique resource
   for evaluating MT models, and (ii) a corpus for the analysis of
   MT-mediated communication. We provide an initial analysis of the corpus
   to confirm that the participants' judgments reveal perceptible
   differences in MT quality between the two MT systems used.}},

Abstract = {{``GaOTf{''} is a simple, convenient source of low-valent gallium for
   synthetic chemistry and catalysis. However, little is currently known
   about its composition or reactivity. In this work, Ga-71 NMR
   spectroscopy shows the presence of {[}Ga(arene)(n)](+) salts on
   oxidation of Ga metal with AgOTf in arene solvents. However, a more
   complex picture of speciation is uncovered by X-ray diffraction studies.
   In all cases, mixed-valence compounds containing Ga-arene and Ga-OTf
   coordination motifs, in addition to an unusual ``naked{''} {[}Ga](+)
   ion, are found. Addition of 18-crown-6 allows for the isolation of a
   discrete Ga-I crown complex. Evidence of a potential intermediate in the

Abstract = {{Schmallenberg virus (SBV), an arthropod-transmitted pathogenic
   bunyavirus, continues to be a threat to the European livestock industry,
   causing morbidity and mortality among young ruminant livestock. Here, we
   describe a novel SBV subunit vaccine, based on bacterially expressed SBV
   nucleoprotein (SBV-N) administered with a veterinary-grade Saponin
   adjuvant. When assayed in an IFNAR(-/-) mouse model, SBV-N with Saponin
   induced strong non-neutralizing broadly virus-reactive antibodies,
   decreased clinical signs, as well as significantly reduced viremia.
   Vaccination assays also suggest that this level of immune protection is
   cell mediated, as evidenced by the lack of neutralizing antibodies, as
   well as interferon-gamma secretion observed in vitro. Therefore, based
   on these results, bacterially expressed SBV-N, co-administered with
   veterinary-grade Saponin adjuvant may serve as a promising economical
   alternative to current SBV vaccines, and warrant further evaluation in
   large ruminant animal models. Moreover, we propose that this strategy
   may be applicable to other bunyaviruses.}},

Abstract = {{Joining of dissimilar materials using bulk forming processes is a
   powerful technique to combine specific properties of the materials used.
   There are manifold processes which are capable to produce high
   performance dissimilar joints by forming. The type and degree of
   deformation at the interface, the type of surface preparation as well as
   the metallurgical fit and the forming temperature are the most important
   parameters to achieve a sound metallic bonding. The underlying processes
   at the interface and the influencing factors to get a strong/deformable
   hybrid are discussed. Furthermore, suitable materials combinations are
   considered from a metallurgical point of view. Related problems due to
   the different material characteristics and microstructural changes
   during joining and after post-forming heat treatment are also treated in
   detail. The wide range of applicable processes used are compared
   regarding their pros and cons. Solid state joining does not mean welding
   a priori but can also be assigned to forming. Typical and more advanced
   applications of tailored formed hybrids are enumerated, which
   demonstrate the high potential of this innovative technology.}},

Abstract = {{The diagnosis of somatic and germline TP53 mutations in human tumors or
   in individuals prone to various types of cancer has now reached the
   clinic. To increase the accuracy of the prediction of TP53 variant
   pathogenicity, we gathered functional data from three independent
   large-scale saturation mutagenesis screening studies with experimental
   data for more than 10,000 TP53 variants performed in different settings
   (yeast or mammalian) and with different readouts (transcription, growth
   arrest or apoptosis). Correlation analysis and multidimensional scaling
   showed excellent agreement between all these variables. Furthermore, we
   found that some missense mutations localized in TP53 exons led to
   impaired TP53 splicing as shown by an analysis of the TP53 expression
   data from the cancer genome atlas. With the increasing availability of
   genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data, it is essential to employ
   both protein and RNA prediction to accurately define variant
   pathogenicity.}},

Abstract = {{Coordination polymers (CPs) have attracted considerable attention for
   use in noble-metal-free electrochemical water splitting, for example, by
   the hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER). Transition-metal
   sites with aqueous accessibility and local coordination flexibility are
   highly desirable in CPs for use as coordination-polymer-based
   electrocatalysts, but the challenge of structural assembly has limited
   their development. By analogy with the hydrogen bond cluster around the
   water-splitting center in photosystem II, the polycarboxylate aryl ether
   ligand and first-row transition-metal (Co and Ni) salts were employed to
   assemble CP-based electrocatalysts for water splitting. The obtained
   monometallic CPs, Co-HL (1) \{{[}Co-2(HL)(H2O)(5)]center dot
   3H(2)O\}(n), Ni-HL (2) \{{[}Ni-2(HL)(H2O)(5)]center dot 3H(2)O\}(n), and
   bimetallic CPs, Co/Ni-HL, with different ratios of Co/Ni ions had
   semirigid isostructural frameworks and carboxylate-water hydrogen bond
   clusters around the transition-metal sites. The susceptibility of the
   hydrogen bond cluster and response of the local coordination environment
   to stimuli were examined by investigating the thermo-/solvatochromism
   performance of the CPs. The local hydrogen bond system within the CPs
   contributes to electron injection and the synergistic bimetallic effect
   to support electrochemical applications. Among the mono- and bimetallic
   CP materials, Co/Ni-HL(5:5), with a Co/Ni ratio of 5:5, exhibited the
   optimal water splitting performance. This bimetallic CP was grown in
   situ on FeNi foam to improve the conductivity, and the composite
   material exhibited excellent performance, with overpotentials of 258 mV
   for the OER and 90 mV for the HER at 10 mA cm(-2), a small Tafel slope,
   and high faradaic efficiency. Overall water splitting generated a
   current density of 10 mA cm(-2) at a voltage of 1.52 V with excellent
   durability; its performance was comparable to that of state-of-the-art
   materials for this application.}},

Title = {{Use of sequence analysis for classifying individual antidepressant

Journal = {{BMC PSYCHIATRY}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundOver the past decade, antidepressant prescriptions have
   increased in European countries and the United States, partly due to an
   increase in the number of new cases of mental illness. This paper
   demonstrates an innovative approach to the classification of population
   level change in mental health status, using administrative data for a
   large sample of the Scottish population. We aimed to identify groups of
   individuals with similar patterns of change in pattern of prescribing,
   validate these groups by comparison with other indicators of mental
   illness, and characterise the population most at risk of increasing
   mental ill health.MethodsNational Health Service (NHS) prescription data
   were linked to the Scottish Longitudinal Study (SLS), a 5.3\% sample of
   the Scottish population (N =151,418). Antidepressant prescription status
   over the previous 6 months was recorded for every month for which data
   were available (January 2009-December 2014), and sequence dissimilarity
   was computed by optimal matching. Hierarchical clustering was used to
   create groups of participants who had similar patterns of change, with
   multi-level logistic regression used to understand group
   membership.ResultsFive distinct prescription pattern groups were
   observed, indicating: no prescriptions (76\%), occasional prescriptions
   (10\%), continuation of prior use of prescriptions (8\%), a new course
   of prescriptions started (4\%) or ceased taking prescriptions (3\%).
   Young, white, female participants, of low social grade, residing in
   socially deprived neighbourhoods, living alone, being separated/divorced
   or out of the labour force, were more likely to be in the group that
   started a new course of antidepressant prescriptions.ConclusionsThe use
   of sequence analysis for classifying individual antidepressant
   trajectories offers a novel approach for capturing population-level
   changes in mental health risk. By classifying individuals into groups
   based on their anti-depressant medication use we can better identify how
   over time, mental health is associated with individual risk factors and
   contextual factors at the local level and the macro political and
   economic scale.}},

Abstract = {{Patients with cancer are at higher risk of more severe COVID-19
   infection and have more associated complications. The position paper
   describes the management of cancer patients, especially those receiving
   anticancer treatment, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Dyspnea is a common
   emergency presentation in patients with cancer with a wide range of
   differential diagnoses, including pulmonary embolism, pleural disease,
   lymphangitis, and infection, of which SARS-CoV-2 is now a pathogen to be
   considered. Screening interviews to determine whether patients may be
   infected with COVID-19 are imperative to prevent the spread of
   infection, especially within healthcare facilities. Cancer patients
   testing positive with no or minimal symptoms may be monitored from home.
   Telemedicine is an option to aid in following patients without potential
   exposure. Management of complications of systemic anticancer treatment,
   such as febrile neutropenia (FN), is of particular importance during the
   COVID-19 pandemic where clinicians aim to minimize patients' risk of
   infection and need for hospital visits. Outpatient management of
   patients with low-risk FN is a safe and effective strategy. Although the
   MASCC score has not been validated in patients with suspected or
   confirmed SARS-CoV-2, it has nevertheless performed well in patients
   with a range of infective illnesses and, accordingly, it is reasonable
   to expect efficacy in the clinical setting of COVID-19. Risk
   stratification of patients presenting with FN is a vital tenet of the
   evolving sepsis and pandemic strategy, necessitating access to locally
   formulated services based on MASCC and other national and international
   guidelines. Innovative oncology services will need to utilize
   telemedicine, hospital at home, and ambulatory care services approaches
   not only to limit the number of hospital visits but also to anticipate
   the complications of the anticancer treatments.}},

   Injections: Results of a Survey of Sports Medicine Physicians}},
Journal = {{PM\&R}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Background Physician decision-making surrounding choices for large joint
   and bursa injections is poorly defined, yet influences patient safety
   and treatment effectiveness.
   Objective To identify practice patterns and rationale related to
   injectate choices for large joint and bursal injections performed by
   physician members of the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine
   (AMSSM).
   Design An electronic survey was sent to 3400 members of the AMSSM.
   Demographic variables were collected: primary specialty (residency),
   training location, practice location, years of clinical experience,
   current practice type, and rationale for choosing an injectate.
   Participants A total of 674 physicians responded (minimum response rate
   of 20\%).
   Intervention Not applicable.
   Main Outcome Measures Outcomes of interest included corticosteroid type
   and dose, local anesthetic type, and total injectate volume for each
   large joint or bursa (hip, knee, and shoulder).
   Results Most respondents used triamcinolone (50\% to 56\% of physicians,
   depending on injection location) or methylprednisolone (25\% to 29\% of
   physicians), 21 to 40 mg (53\% to 60\% of physicians), diluted with
   lidocaine (79\% to 87\%) for all large joint or bursa injections. It was
   noted that 36.2\% (244/674) of respondents reported using >40 mg for at
   least one injection type. Most (90.5\%, 610/674) reported using an
   anesthetic other than ropivacaine for at least one type of joint or
   bursa injection. Physicians who reported lidocaine use were less likely
   to report that their injectate choice was based on the literature that
   they reviewed (odds ratio {[}OR] 0.41 {[}0.27-0.62], P < .001).
   Respondents predominantly used 5 to 7 mL of total injectate for all
   large joints or bursae (45\% to 54\% of respondents), except for the pes
   anserine bursa, where 3-4 mL was more common (51\% of physicians).
   Conclusions It appears that triamcinolone and methylprednisolone are the

Abstract = {{It is now recognized that to fully understand the role of host genetic
   variation on susceptibility to HIV-1 infection, investigations must be
   extended to African populations. We sought to determine if genetic
   variation in IL10 are associated with HIV-1 infection in a West African
   cohort in Mali. HIV-infected and -uninfected individuals were genotyped
   for three common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located at
   positions -592 (C/A), -819 (C/T), and -1082 (G/A) of the IL10 promoter.
   We found that the ATA haplotype, which has been previously associated
   with low IL-10 expression, was the most represented in the cohort.
   Although we observed a trend toward an increased frequency of ATA/ATA
   carriage in HIV-infected compared with -uninfected individuals, the
   difference was not statistically significant. Similarly, individual IL10
   SNPs were not significantly enriched in the HIV-infected group,
   suggesting that IL10 genetic variants are not associated with HIV-1 in
   this West African cohort from Mali.}},

Title = {{Outlining Impact of Hybrid Composition of Nanoparticles Suspended in

Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{In this theoretical analysis, our main concern is to explore the
   physical consequences of hybrid nanoparticle (NP) suspension in blood
   flowing through an inclined artery with mild stenosis filled with porous
   substances under the influence of a uniform magnetic field and heat
   source or sink. Darcy's law is employed to predict the flow
   characteristics in the porous medium. The basic transported equations of
   blood flow in the diseased artery are formulated in a cylindrical
   coordinate system and simplified under the assumption of mild stenosis.
   The approximated analytical solutions based on the homotopy perturbation
   method (HPM) are achieved. Influences of significant physical parameters
   on the blood flow characteristics are displayed graphically and physical
   aspects are analyzed in detail. Graphical results based on the
   semi-analytical solutions reveal that the blood flow is appreciably
   influenced by the existence of stenosis at the arterial wall. The high
   concentration of hybrid nanoparticles significantly reduces the
   resistance impedance to the blood flow in a stenotic artery. The blood
   temperature due to the suspension of hybrid nanoparticles is found to be
   lower in comparison to copper blood or pure blood. The blood trapping
   pattern also manifests that the impulsion of hybrid nanoparticles speeds
   up the blood flow in the stenotic region. The rheological behavior of
   blood with hybrid nanoparticle (copper and alumina) suspension is
   examined because of decisive importance of nanoparticles in biomedicine,
   diagnosis, and treatment of arterial and cardiovascular diseases. It is
   believed that the simulated results hold key towards designing and
   analysis of bio-medical instruments or devices for great potential
   treatment modalities, nanodrug delivery systems, and anticancer drug
   industry, etc.}},

Abstract = {{Glyphosate-based herbicides are widely used in global agriculture, and
   their effects on different non-target animal organisms have been the
   focus of many toxicological studies. Regarding the potential role of
   glyphosate-based herbicides as an endocrine disruptor, the present study
   aims to investigate the effects of the herbicide Roundup WG (R) (RWG) on
   female reproduction, specifically on the ovarian maturation of Danio
   rerio. Adult females were exposed to low concentrations of RWG (0.065,
   0.65, and 6.5 mg L-1) for 15 days, and then the ovaries were submitted
   to structural and morphometric procedures, accompanied by analysis of
   the vitellin protein content. Our results showed an increase of initial
   ovarian follicle numbers, decrease of late ovarian follicles, and
   smaller diameter of ovarian follicles in fish exposed to 0.065 and 6.5
   mg L-1. The thickness of vitelline envelope was reduced, and the
   vitellin protein content was increased in the ovarian follicle in the
   two highest concentrations. Ultrastructural changes in the ovarian
   follicular component were evident and expressed by the cell index;
   vacuolization in follicular cells, increase of perivitelline space, and
   impaired mitochondria in oocytes were observed. Therefore, RWG adversely
   affects the ovarian maturation in D. rerio, and these changes can lead
   to reproductive toxicity, compromising population dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Relative to urban populations, rural patients may have more
   limited access to care, which may undermine timely bladder cancer (BCa)
   diagnosis and even survival. Methods We tested the effect of residency
   status (rural areas {[}RA < 2500 inhabitants] vs. urban clusters {[}UC
   >= 2500 inhabitants] vs. urbanized areas {[}UA, >= 50,000 inhabitants])
   on BCa stage at presentation, as well as on cancer-specific mortality
   (CSM) and other cause mortality (OCM), according to the US Census Bureau
   definition. Multivariate competing risks regression (CRR) models were
   fitted after matching of RA or UC with UA in stage-stratified analyses.
   Results Of 222,330 patients, 3496 (1.6\%) resided in RA, 25,462 (11.5\%)
   in UC and 193,372 (87\%) in UA. Age, tumor stage, radical cystectomy
   rates or chemotherapy use were comparable between RA, UC and UA (all p >
   0.05). At 10 years, RA was associated with highest OCM followed by UC
   and UA (30.9\% vs. 27.7\% vs. 25.6\%, p < 0.01). Similarly, CSM was also
   marginally higher in RA or UC vs. UA (20.0\% vs. 20.1\% vs. 18.8\%, p =
   0.01). In stage-stratified, fully matched CRR analyses, increased OCM
   and CSM only applied to stage T1 BCa patients. Conclusion We did not
   observe meaningful differences in access to treatment or stage
   distribution, according to residency status. However, RA and to a lesser
   extent UC residency status, were associated with higher OCM and
   marginally higher CSM in T1N0M0 patients. This observation should be
   further validated or refuted in additional epidemiological
   investigations.}},

   dS m(-1)) and two propagation methods (cuttings and seeds), with twelve
   repetitions each. There was a negative effect of rising levels of NaCl
   for the majority of biometric and physiological traits evaluated. The
   species propagated from seeds presented the most severe
   morphophysiological and anatomical alterations under salinity. P. edulis
   (the most commonly cultivated species) showed the greatest
   morphophysiological changes under salinity, inducing larger stem
   diameter, chlorophyll content index, total water consumption, root dry
   weight, shoot dry weight, total dry weight, root dry weight/shoot dry
   weight ratio, root length and volume and also more severe anatomical
   alterations, such as midrib cell disorganization, greater thickness of
   palisade parenchyma, lower intercellular volume in the spongy parenchyma
   and greater deposition of calcium oxalate in the leaves and roots. On
   the other hand, the wild species, P. cincinnata and P. gibertii, were
   more tolerant to salinity, with less severe biometric, physiological and

Abstract = {{Objectives To compare the psychometric properties of three OHRQoL
   indicators (GOHAI, OHIP-14, and OHIP-EDENT) in a group of complete
   edentulous subjects and to explore the ability of these instruments to
   distinguish between individuals with different prosthetic and oral
   health status. Methods This was a cross-sectional study. Edentulous
   individuals aged 60 years and more were recruited between January 2019
   and February 2020 in a medical and dental care centers. The Lebanese
   versions of GOHAI, OHIP-14, and OHIP-EDENT were used. External and
   internal consistencies were assessed using intraclass correlation
   coefficient (ICC) and Cronbach alpha, respectively. The concurrent
   validity was evaluated by testing the indicators against a proxy measure
   of a similar concept. To test their discriminative abilities, the ADD
   (GOHAI and OHIP) and SC (GOHAI and OHIP) scores were dichotomized
   according to the 25th and 75th percentile, respectively, and
   multivariate analyses were performed using sociodemographic, clinical,
   and subjective health parameters as explanatory variables. Results Two
   hundred and two edentulous subjects (age: 72.94 +/- 7.378 years) were
   included. The proportion of subjects with no impact was lower for
   OHIP-EDENT (7.9\%) compared to GOHAI (28.2\%) and OHIP-14 (38.6\%).
   Reproducibility was satisfactory for all OHRQoL tools since they were
   able to reproduce the results consistently in time (ICC > 0.80). The
   Cronbach alpha values were greater than 0.8 indicating acceptable
   internal consistency. The concurrent validity of the three tools was
   acceptable since subjects with lower OHRQoL score were less satisfied
   with their dentures and reported a higher need for self-rated therapy.
   Concerning the discriminant validity, OHIP-EDENT was more discriminant
   than OHIP-14 and GOHAI, since it was more able to identify patients with
   poor prosthetic issues or using instable denture. Conclusion The
   OHIP-EDENT was more effective in identifying edentulous individuals with
   oral and prosthetic problems. Our results can help decide which dental
   instrument to use to assess the perception of oral health in edentulous
   individuals. More prospective studies are required to compare their
   evaluative properties.}},

Journal = {{SN APPLIED SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Hybrid flow shop (HFS) scheduling problem is combining of the flow shop
   and parallel machine scheduling problem. Hybrid flow shop with
   multiprocessor task (HFSMT) scheduling problem is a special structure of
   the hybrid flow shop scheduling problem. The HFSMT scheduling is a
   well-known NP-hard problem. In this study, a new memetic algorithm which
   combined the global and local search methods is proposed to solve the
   HFSMT scheduling problems. The developed new memetic global and local
   search (MGLS) algorithm consists of four operators. These are natural
   selection, crossover, mutation and local search methods. A preliminary
   test is performed to set the best values of these developed new MGLS
   algorithm operators for solving HFSMT scheduling problem. The best
   values of the MGLS algorithm operators are determined by a full
   factorial experimental design. The proposed new MGLS algorithm is
   applied the 240 HFSMT scheduling instances from the literature. The
   performance of the generated new MGLS algorithm is compared with the
   genetic algorithm (GA), parallel greedy algorithm (PGA) and efficient
   genetic algorithm (EGA) which are used in the previous studies to solve
   the same set of HFSMT scheduling benchmark instances from the
   literature. The results show that the proposed new MGLS algorithm
   provides better makespan than the other algorithms for HFSMT scheduling
   instances. The developed new MGLS algorithm could be applicable to
   practical production environment.}},

Title = {{A Bovine Enteric Mycobacterium Infection Model to Analyze Parenteral
   Vaccine-Induced Mucosal Immunity and Accelerate Vaccine Discovery}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Mycobacterial diseases of cattle are responsible for considerable
   production losses worldwide. In addition to their importance in animals,
   these infections offer a nuanced approach to understanding persistent
   mycobacterial infection in native host species. Mycobacterium avium ssp.
   paratuberculosis (MAP) is an enteric pathogen that establishes a
   persistent, asymptomatic infection in the small intestine. Difficulty in
   reproducing infection in surrogate animal models and limited
   understanding of mucosal immune responses that control enteric infection
   in the natural host have been major barriers to MAP vaccine development.
   We previously developed a reproducible challenge model to establish a
   consistent MAP infection using surgically isolated intestinal segments
   prepared in neonatal calves. In the current study, we evaluated whether
   intestinal segments could be used to screen parenteral vaccines that
   alter mucosal immune responses to MAP infection. Using Silirum(R) - a
   commercial MAP bacterin - we demonstrate that intestinal segments
   provide a platform for assessing vaccine efficacy within a relatively
   rapid period of 28 days post-infection. Significant differences between
   vaccinates and non-vaccinates could be detected using quantitative
   metrics including bacterial burden in intestinal tissue, MAP shedding
   into the intestinal lumen, and vaccine-induced mucosal immune responses.
   Comparing vaccine-induced responses in mucosal leukocytes isolated from
   the site of enteric infection versus blood leukocytes revealed
   substantial inconsistences between these immune compartments. Moreover,
   parenteral vaccination with Silirum did not induce equal levels of
   protection throughout the small intestine. Significant control of MAP
   infection was observed in the continuous but not the discrete Peyer's
   patches. Analysis of these regional mucosal immune responses revealed
   novel correlates of immune protection associated with reduced infection
   that included an increased frequency of CD335(+) innate lymphoid cells,
   and increased expression of IL21 and IL27. Thus, intestinal segments
   provide a novel model to accelerate vaccine screening and discovery by
   testing vaccines directly in the natural host and provides a unique
   opportunity to interrogate mucosal immune responses to mycobacterial
   infections.}},

Abstract = {{Scolecophidia (Squamata, Serpentes), commonly known as blindsnakes,
   wormsnakes or threadsnakes comprises a group of small snakes, with
   relatively few systematic and morphological studies when compared to
   Alethinophidia. Since the external morphology is very conserved amongst
   scolecophidians, internal morphological studies-such as the hemipenial
   morphology-are useful to unravel several systematic issues within the
   group. We aimed to describe the hemipenial morphology of Epictiavellardi
   (Epictinae, Leptotyphlopidae) based on 16 organs belonging to eight
   specimens. The organ is unilobed, with the body conspicuously narrower
   than the base and with the apex slightly expanded, without any
   macroscopic ornamentation. The comparison of the hemipenial morphology
   of E.vellardi with other hemipenes of Epictia spp. allowed us to
   identify two general morphological patterns for the genus, which are
   proposed and discussed in detail in the present study. The results found
   herein may be extremely relevant for future hemipenial descriptions. In
   addition, independent characters found in Types I and II (such as
   ornamentation, shape of base, body and apex) should be regarded for
   future systematic and evolutionary morphology studies within
   Leptotyphlopidae, in addition to assisting in the taxonomy and
   identification of species of the genus.}},

Journal = {{ELIFE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Complex cognitive functions such as working memory and decision-making
   require information maintenance over seconds to years, from transient
   sensory stimuli to long-term contextual cues. While theoretical accounts
   predict the emergence of a corresponding hierarchy of neuronal
   timescales, direct electrophysiological evidence across the human cortex
   is lacking. Here, we infer neuronal timescales from invasive
   intracranial recordings. Timescales increase along the principal
   sensorimotor-to-association axis across the entire human cortex, and
   scale with single-unit timescales within macaques. Cortex-wide
   transcriptomic analysis shows direct alignment between timescales and
   expression of excitation- and inhibition-related genes, as well as genes
   specific to voltage-gated transmembrane ion transporters. Finally,
   neuronal timescales are functionally dynamic: prefrontal cortex
   timescales expand during working memory maintenance and predict
   individual performance, while cortex-wide timescales compress with
   aging. Thus, neuronal timescales follow cytoarchitectonic gradients
   across the human cortex and are relevant for cognition in both short and
   long terms, bridging microcircuit physiology with macroscale dynamics
   and behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The mean parameters of a two-dimensional incompressible turbulent
   boundary layer with zero pressure gradient were measured on the smooth
   wall of the TsAGI T-128 transonic wind tunnel in the range Re-theta =
   5.3 x 10(4)-2.9 x 10(5) velocity profiles, skin friction coefficient,
   and shape factor. Novel data were obtained in the range Re-theta
   approximate to 2.35 x 10(5)-2.9 x 10(5). At the maximum Reynolds number,
   the record value of the von Karman number Re-tau similar to 1 x 10(5)
   was reached and the logarithmic law was maintained up to y(+)
   approximate to 1.3 x 10(4). The equilibrium state of the boundary layer
   was estimated using Clauser's equilibrium parameter, which was G =
   6.4-6.8 for high Reynolds numbers. The results of the investigation
   confirm the conclusions of other studies on the universality of
   dimensionless velocity profile in the boundary layer outer region. The
   results were compared with semi-empirical dependencies, direct numerical
   simulation (DNS) results and the results of other studies performed both
   on wind tunnel walls and on a flat plate. At high Reynolds numbers the
   agreement between the shape factor was within Delta H = +/- 0.012 (+/-
   1\%), with a skin friction coefficient-Delta c(f)= +/- 0.00006 (+/-
   3.7\%). Graphic}},

Title = {{Clinicopathologic Features and Prognosis of BRAF Mutated Colorectal
   Cancer Patients}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: BRAF(V600E) mutation is associated with poor prognosis of
   colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, but the comparison of
   clinic-pathologic features between V600E and non-V600E mutation was not
   well-known in CRC patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the
   clinical and pathological features, prognostic value of BRAF mutations
   in CRC.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective study to characterize the clinical
   and pathological features and survival of patients with BRAF mutated
   CRC. Patients were classified according to BRAF status as BRAF(V600E)
   mutation and non-V600E mutations. Difference of characteristics and
   survival between the two groups was analyzed.
   Results: There was no significant difference in gender, family history,
   location of primary tumor, metastatic sites between patients with
   BRAF-V600E mutation and non-V600E mutations. Patients with V600E
   mutation were younger than those with non-V600E mutations (p = 0.002).
   Patients with BRAF(V600E) mutation showed a poorer outcome than those
   with non-V600E mutations (23.1 vs. 49.9 months, respectively, p =
   0.0024). Lack of CDX2 expression was associated with worse prognosis
   (mOS: 9.4 m vs. not reached, respectively, p = 0.016). Status of V600E
   mutation did not affect the mPFS and ORR of first-line or second-line
   treatment.
   Conclusion: BRAF(V600E) mutation defines a distinct subgroup of CRC with
   worse prognosis. Lack of CDX2 expression is associated with poor OS.
   Status of V600E mutation did not affect the mPFS of first-line or
   second-line treatment.}},

Title = {{Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo in emergency department: How to
   treat?}},
Journal = {{HONG KONG JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE}},
Abstract = {{Background:
   The treatment of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) has not
   been well studied. Many clinicians are indifferent about canalith
   reposition maneuvers and frequently prefer medical treatments.
   Objectives:
   We aimed to detect efficacy of Epley maneuver in relieving symptoms of
   benign paroxysmal positional vertigo patients diagnosed in emergency
   department and if medical treatments are useful in patients whose
   symptoms were not relieved.
   Methods:
   The study was conducted as a prospective cohort study in the emergency
   department of a tertiary hospital. Patients who were over 18 years of
   age and presented to emergency department with complaints of vertigo
   symptoms and nausea and had a positive Dix-Hallpike test were included
   in the study. Patients' demographic data, possible etiological factors,
   affected ear, and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo diagnosis in the
   history were recorded on the study data form. The European Evaluation of
   Vertigo scale and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score of nausea and
   vertigo symptoms were graded and recorded for each patient before and
   after treatment.
   Results:
   Ninety patients were included in the study in total. Epley maneuver was
   carried out to all patients. Vertigo symptoms VAS (VAS(d)) score (p <
   0.001), nausea and vomiting VAS (VAS(nv)) score (p < 0.001), and
   European Evaluation of Vertigo scale score (p < 0.001) of all patients
   showed a statistically significant decrease after Epley maneuver. A
   combination of dimenhydrinate and metoclopramide helped to reduce VAS(d)
   (p = 0.048), VAS(nv) (p = 0.031), and European Evaluation of Vertigo
   scale scores (p = 0.001) at a statistically significant level more than
   dimenhydrinate treatment alone.
   Conclusions:
   Epley maneuver may be applied to every patient with benign paroxysmal
   positional vertigo. Dimenhydrinate and/or metoclopramide helps to
   control patients' symptoms whose symptoms remain despite Epley maneuver.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic,
   self-isolation at home was adopted to control the spread of COVID-19 in
   China for 3 months from 29 January 2020. The psychological status of
   cancer survivors is affected by their social environment. In this study,
   we investigated the psychological status and psychological symptoms of
   Chinese cancer survivors.
   Methods A longitudinal study design was adopted, and an online sample of
   cancer survivors was successfully recruited via the Internet communities
   of cancer support groups. From 14 February to 25 May, 111 cancer
   survivor families completed the symptom checklist 90 (SCL-90) online
   three times (T1:14 to 24 February; T2: 1 to 10 April; T3: 15 to 25 May).
   Results For survivors and their family members, the mean total score of
   the SCL-90 was 172.05 (13.30) and 142.76 (26.80) at T1, 155.91 (12.18)
   and 133.42 (15.93) at T2, and 142.75 (11.56) and 130.14 (14.16) at T3,
   respectively. The SCL-90 scores of cancer survivors were significantly
   higher than those of family members and Chinese norms at T1, T2, and T3.
   Nine psychological symptoms of the SCL-90 in cancer survivors
   significantly declined from T1 to T2 and T3.
   Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant adverse impact
   on cancer survivors and their families. Psychological assistance should
   be provided to cancer survivors.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLOUD COMPUTING-ADVANCES SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Cloud computing is a popular emerging computing technology that has
   revolutionized information technology through flexible provisioning of
   computing resources. Therefore, efforts to develop an effective resource
   management approach have found that implementing efficient resource
   sharing among multiple customers that considers power saving,
   service-level agreements, and network traffic simultaneously is
   difficult. This paper proposes a practical integrated pipeline that can
   use various algorithms. The performance of each algorithm is evaluated
   independently to obtain the combination of algorithms that guarantees a
   resource-effective cloud data center framework. This integrated resource
   management pipeline approach would optimize performance based on several
   key performance indicators, such as power saving, network traffic, and
   service-level agreements, for either the whole system or the end-user.
   The performance of the proposed resource management framework was
   evaluated using a real testbed. The results demonstrated that the
   proactive double exponential smoothing algorithm prevents unnecessary
   migrations, the MMTMC2 VM selection algorithm improved the quality of
   service for end-users and reduced overall energy consumption and network
   traffic, and the medium-fit placement algorithm provided load balancing
   between active servers and decreased service level agreement violations.
   The performance comparison illustrated that the combination of these
   algorithms was considered to be the best solution toward a dynamic
   resource-effective cloud data center. Our results showed that energy
   consumption and the total number of migrations decreased by 16.64\% and
   49.44\%, respectively.}},

   domestic workers in Malaysia}},
Journal = {{GENDER PLACE AND CULTURE}},
Abstract = {{This article investigates the construction of the bodies of live-in
   Indonesian domestic workers in their employers' homes in Malaysia.
   Through an analysis of everyday practices at the micro level, this study
   suggests that the spatiality of domestic work is central to the bodily
   construction of migrant workers. Surveillance and mobility restrictions
   in the employer's home condition the worker's body to be constantly
   productive. The body, at the same time, is inscribed with gender, racial
   and class differences. It is marked as deferential as a result of its
   proximity to the employer's body in the enclosed space of the home.
   These practices take place at home, but they draw on practices by the
   host state and recruitment agencies. This suggests that bodily
   construction at the household level is inherently linked to national and
   global processes. Migrant domestic workers nevertheless may find
   themselves either adopting these constructions through self-discipline
   or resisting them to a limited extent. In doing so, the workers' bodily
   performances bring the home into being as a performative space of power.}},

   of Mg10Ni (495 mL.g(-1) H-2, 56\%) in 2 min. The lowest hydrolysis
   activation energy (18.74 kJ.mol(-1)) can be achieved by Mg10Ni-5
   wt\%MoS2, which means low energy consumption. Mg10Ni with higher
   specific surface area (4.04 m(2).g(-1)) than that of
   Mg10Ni-5wt.\%MoS2-15 min (0.78 m(2).g(-1)) presents worse H-2 generation
   performance, indicating that higher specific surface area is the
   secondary determinant for superior initial hydrolysis kinetics and
   higher conversion yield compared with the added MoS2. The added MoS2
   with specific morphologic structure can provide auxiliary mass transfer
   paths, which shorten the transfer distance and destroy the continuous
   colloidal layer. Mg-rich alloys optimized for rapid and efficient H-2
   production performance are expected to be applied large-scale H-2
   generators.

Abstract = {{Human microbiome studies are increasingly incorporating macroecological
   approaches, such as community assembly, network analysis and functional
   redundancy to more fully characterize the microbiome. Such analyses have
   not been applied to ancient human microbiomes, preventing insights into
   human microbiome evolution. We address this issue by analysing published
   ancient microbiome datasets: coprolites from Rio Zape (n = 7; 700 CE
   Mexico) and historic dental calculus (n = 44; 1770-1855 CE, UK), as well
   as two novel dental calculus datasets: Maya (n = 7; 170 BCE-885 CE,
   Belize) and Nuragic Sardinians (n = 11; 1400-850 BCE, Italy).
   Periodontitis-associated bacteria (Treponema denticola, Fusobacterium
   nucleatum and Eubacterium saphenum) were identified as keystone taxa in
   the dental calculus datasets. Coprolite keystone taxa included known
   short-chain fatty acid producers (Eubacterium biforme,
   Phascolarctobacterium succinatutens) and potentially disease-associated
   bacteria (Escherichia, Brachyspira). Overlap in ecological profiles
   between ancient and modern microbiomes was indicated by similarity in
   functional response diversity profiles between contemporary
   hunter-gatherers and ancient coprolites, as well as parallels between
   ancient Maya, historic UK, and modern Spanish dental calculus; however,
   the ancient Nuragic dental calculus shows a distinct ecological
   structure. We detected key ecological signatures from ancient microbiome
   data, paving the way to expand understanding of human microbiome
   evolution.

Abstract = {{In an earlier work, it was shown that single-slit diffraction of matter
   waves can be considered as position measurement of particles and that
   the Fresnel and Fraunhofer diffraction patterns result from the time
   evolution of the same collapsed quantum wave function. This quantum
   mechanical treatment of diffraction of particles, based on the standard
   postulates of quantum mechanics and the postulate of existence of
   quantum trajectories, leads to the `position measurement-induced
   collapse' (PMIC) states. In the present work, an idealised experimental
   set-up to test these PMIC states is proposed. The apparatus consists of
   a modified Lloyd's mirror in optics, with two reflectors instead of one.
   The diffraction patterns for this case predicted by the PMIC formalism
   are presented. They exhibit quantum fractal structures in space-time
   called `quantum carpets', first discovered by Berry. The PMIC formalism
   in this case closely follows the `boundary bound diffraction' analysed
   in a previous work by Tounli, Alverado and Sanz. In addition to having
   obtained their results, we have identified that the Fresnel and
   Fraunhofer patterns are indeed present here. It is anticipated that the
   verification of fractal and nonfractal features of the wave function at
   various times and also the predicted revival distances to the screen by
   this experiment will help to better understand `quantum collapse'.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Geological processes of island growth and erosion, in addition to
   eustatic sea-level fluctuations, alter key physical properties of
   oceanic islands, such as area, elevation and isolation over time. These
   dynamics operate over similar time-scales to the biogeographical
   processes of colonization, speciation and extinction, and thus should
   strongly affect island biodiversity patterns as we observe them today.
   Here, we study the effects of geological history and eustatic sea-level
   fluctuations on biodiversity patterns in the Hawaiian, Galapagos and
   Canary Islands, using an agent-based simulation model.
   Location Hawaiian Islands, Galapagos Islands and Canary Islands.
   Time period Geological history up to 20 Ma.
   Taxa Spermatophyta, Pteridophyta, Passeriformes, Lepidoptera and
   Coleoptera.
   Methods We analysed the effect of geological, eustatic and
   biogeographical processes via a spatially explicit agent-based
   simulation model. We compared the emergent patterns with observed
   species richness and the proportion of single-island endemics across the
   considered taxa and archipelagos.
   Results Our results suggested that both geological and eustatic
   processes have affected biodiversity assembly in the Hawaiian and
   Galapagos Islands. In the Canary Islands, we found only the proportion
   of single-island endemics to be affected by historical configurations.
   Main conclusions Our results highlight the key role of past geological
   and eustatic processes in affecting modern insular biodiversity
   patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the vast documentation of the PPP research in many countries,
   the PPP research in the context of Tanzania is lacking, let along the
   housing sector of Tanzania. To address this knowledge gap, the purpose
   of this paper is to identify the driving forces for adopting PPPs in
   Tanzanian housing projects. Second is to examine how driving forces
   differ between the public and private sector respondents.
   Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 public and private
   sector practitioners to collect data and the interview transcripts were
   analysed using NVivo (version 10 package). Direct content analysis was
   used to validate the findings and provide in-depth insights into the
   findings. The results shows that out of the 19 driving forces
   identified, the top 3 driving forces for PPP adoption in Tanzania for
   the public sector respondents are `the need for redeveloping condemned
   properties', `lack of enough financial capacity to undertake housing
   projects' and `fear to lose their condemned properties'. In contrast,
   the top driving forces for the private sector are `prime location' and
   `being a previous tenant'.}},

Abstract = {{The paper analyzes a solution in green manufacturing of foamed or

   technical solution for rice husk ash and ``tales{''} of mixed glass
   cullet reusing based on the specific properties of these materials for
   creation of spherical holes inside ceramic using the process of
   coalescence of cellular glass. The paper reports on experimental results
   obtained from the production of lightweight cellular glass granules
   produced using glass cullet and rice husk ash. Lightweight cellular
   glass granules were mixed with clay, pressed and fired in air at 920
   degrees C. Clay sintering and the formation of ceramic were followed
   with the coalescence of cellular structure of glass granules and with
   the formation of spherical hollows inside the matrix. Density and
   strength of the fired ceramic bodies were determined. It is observed
   that the lightweight ceramics with density 900 divided by 920 kg/m(3)
   possess a compressive strength of about 5 MPa that is acceptable for
   bricks or tiles manufacture. The utilization of amorphous silica waste
   for lightweight ceramics manufacture helps in reducing waste disposal
   concerns and costs associated, and also transforms the waste into an
   alternative raw material with added value, moreover making the final

Abstract = {{``Who owns the sky{''} is not a new question but a persistent one. For
   more than three centuries it emerges as a social, legal, technological,
   and geopolitical problem. Indeed, the aerial is not something that is
   simply above our heads but an element that fluctuates in and out of the
   body. And while the air and the body are inseparable, the aerial has
   been turned directly against the body in various ways since the
   beginning of the 20(th) century. This paper explores the unsettled
   frontiers of the fly-zone, looking into the interrelated occupations,
   exploitations, and democratizations of the aerial. It sketches the
   emergence of the state/corporate no-fly zone (NFZ) through the emergence
   of small-scale civilian drones, which developed into a sophisticated
   industry that negotiates new forms of state power to technology
   corporations. This new configuration of aerial control and management
   complicates the established, state-imposed, regulatory NFZ and suggests
   the development of a new techno-cultural assemblage of spatial closures
   through the air. Against this backdrop, I discuss two case-studies of
   aerial resistance through the use of do-it-yourself (DIY)
   aerial-photography in Israel/Palestine. I show how DIY tactics and tools
   offer a distinctive kind of evocation and provocation that challenge the
   conceptual and material boundaries of the NFZ and direct the attention
   to the ruptured links between the aerial and the human body. Finally, I
   discuss how DIY aerial-photography is also a particular kind of
   testimony and a methodological mediation that allows questioning the
   very premise of knowledge production through technosocial, activist
   engagement.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a reconfigurable antenna design is proposed to realize
   independent pattern, beamwidth and polarization reconfiguration at an
   operating frequency of 2.45 GHz. This antenna is comprised of a dual
   coaxial-feed driven element surrounded by four varactor loaded
   size-tunable parasitic elements. The pattern and beamwidth
   reconfiguration is achieved by utilizing the mutual coupling between the
   active and size-tunable parasitic elements. Reconfigurable feeding
   network is designed and developed to produce two orthogonal linear
   polarization (LVP, LHP) and circular polarization (LHCP, RHCP) states.
   In linear polarization operating mode, main beam of the antenna is
   continuously scanned from theta=0 degrees to 11 degrees, 0 degrees to 32
   degrees, and 0 degrees to 40 degrees in phi = +/- 0 degrees, +/- 45
   degrees, and +/- 90 degrees plane respectively, where theta and phi are

Abstract = {{Purpose Intrafollicular fluid (IFF) melatonin plays a decisive role in
   maintaining granulosa cells' DNA integrity and protects them against
   apoptosis. It reduces oxidative stress and improves the oocyte quality
   with a higher fertilization rate. Method This prospective study
   investigated the antioxidant property of IFF melatonin and its impact on
   IVF outcome parameters. We also explored the relative expression of five
   microRNAs (miR-663b, miR-320a, miR-766-3p, miR-132-3p, miR-16-5p) and
   levels of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) by real-time PCR in unexplained
   infertile patients. We collected 425 follicular fluid (FF) samples
   containing mature oocytes from 295 patients undergoing IVF. Results
   Patients were subgrouped based on IFF melatonin concentration (group A
   <= 30 pg/mL, group B > 70 to <= 110 pg/mL, group C > 111 to <= 385
   pg/mL). Our results showed that patients with <= 30 pg/mL IFF melatonin
   levels have significantly higher oxidative stress markers, cfDNA levels,
   and lower relative expression of miR-663b, miR-320a, miR-766-3p,
   miR-132-3p, and miR-16-5p compared to other subgroups (p < 0.001).
   Similarly, they have a low fertilization rate and a reduced number of
   high-quality day 3 embryos. Conclusion Findings suggest that the
   therapeutic use of melatonin produces a considerable rise in the number
   of mature oocytes retrieved, fertilization rate, and good-quality embryo
   selection. Furthermore, miRNA signature enhances the quality of embryo
   selection, thus, may allow us to classify them as non-invasive
   biomarkers to identify good-quality embryos.}},

Title = {{Factors of Mass Casualty Terrorism}},
Journal = {{SECURITY JOURNAL}},
Abstract = {{Several changes in terrorist tactics have occurred recently. First,
   terrorist attack targets have changed from hard to soft targets. Second,
   terrorists are actively using low-tech terrorism methods that they can
   choose easily. Finally, terrorist attacks are evolving into complex and
   simultaneous terrorist events. This study endeavored to determine
   whether these changes affected the number of casualties from terrorist
   events that occurred in developed countries. Based on the rational
   choice theory and situational crime prevention, the variables were
   constructed based on two dimensions: ``target factors in terrorism{''}
   and ``terrorist attack factors in terrorism.{''} To achieve the purpose
   of this study, a negative binomial regression analysis was performed
   based on data from the Global Terrorism Database. Consequently,
   variables such as ``exposure,{''} ``protection capability,{''} ``attack
   patterns (vehicle),{''} and ``suicide terrorism{''} were verified for
   their statistically significant influence on ``mass casualty terrorism
   (MCT).{''} This study suggests that it is necessary to design a
   preventive environment and arrange for personnel at each site that is
   vulnerable to terrorism to prevent MCT events from occurring inside

Title = {{Faces of clinical pain: Inter-individual facial activity patterns in
   shoulder pain patients}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAIN}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{529-540}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background Facial activity during pain is composed of varying
   combinations of a few elementary facial responses (so-called Action
   Units). A previous study of experimental pain showed that these varying
   combinations can be clustered into distinct facial activity patterns of
   pain. In the present study, we examined whether comparable facial
   activity patterns can also be identified among people suffering from
   clinical pain; namely, shoulder pain.
   Methods Facial expressions of patients suffering from shoulder pain (N =
   126) were recorded while twice undergoing a battery of passive
   range-of-motion tests to their affected limbs (UNBC-McMaster Shoulder
   Pain Expression Archive Database), which elicited peaks of acute pain.
   Facial expressions were analysed using the Facial Action Coding System
   to extract facial Action Units (AUs). Hierarchical cluster analyses were
   used to look for characteristic combinations of these AUs.
   Results Cluster analyses revealed four distinct activity patterns during
   painful movements. Each cluster was composed of different combinations
   of pain-indicative AUs, with one AU common to all clusters, namely,
   ``narrowed eyes{''}. Besides these four clusters, there was a
   ``stoic{''} pattern, characterized by no discernible facial action. The
   identified clusters were relatively stable across time and comparable to
   the facial activity patterns found previously for experimental heat
   pain.
   Conclusions These findings corroborate the hypothesis that facial
   expressions of acute pain are not uniform. Instead, they are composed of
   different combinations of pain-indicative facial responses, with one
   omnipresent response, namely, ``narrowed eyes{''}. Raising awareness
   about these inter-individually different ``faces of pain{''} could
   improve the recognition and, thereby, its diagnostic training for
   professionals, like nurses and physicians.
   Significance Similar to experimental pain, facial activity during evoked
   pain episodes in shoulder pain patients could be clustered into distinct
   faces of pain. Each cluster was composed of different combinations of
   single facial responses, namely: narrowed eyes, which is displayed
   either alone or in combination with opened mouth or wrinkled nose, or
   furrowed brows and closed eyes. These distinct faces of pain may inform
   the training of professionals and computers how to best recognize pain
   based on facial expressions.}},

Title = {{Enabling distributed intelligence in Internet of Things: an air quality
   monitoring use case}},
Journal = {{PERSONAL AND UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING}},
Abstract = {{Air pollution is worsening almost everywhere in the world. According to
   the Health Effects Institute (HEI), more than 95\% of the world
   population breathe polluted air, toxic to their cardiovascular and
   respiratory health, which caused the death of 4.2 million people
   worldwide in 2016. As a result, the air pollution has become one of the
   leading causes of death worldwide. Therefore, an early cost-efficient
   warning system based on precise forecasting tools must be put in place
   to measure and avoid the harmful effects of exposure to the main air
   pollutants. Thus, it is essential to obtain reliable analytical
   information on air quality in a specific time and place. This paper
   focuses on monitoring air quality using a distributed intelligence which
   is a cost-efficient solution that enables a flexible prediction process
   distributed within a network of nodes and devices using a cross-platform
   solution. The suggested architecture enables collaborative learning
   along with collective knowledge graph building and knowledge sharing
   using the state of the art in Internet of Things, distributed machine
   learning, and ontologies. The proposed architecture suggests a flexible
   prediction system personalized for each node based on its need of
   information. Similar nodes get together for collective learning which
   allows for resource optimization, knowledge reusability, and device
   interoperability. The paper describes the modeling framework of
   distributed intelligence monitoring and analysis system designed for

Abstract = {{Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is a calcium-permeable
   cation channel that has been associated with several types of cancer.
   However, its biological significance, as well as its related mechanism
   in endometrial cancer (EC) still remains elusive. In this study, we
   examined the function of calcium in EC, with a specific focus on TRPV4
   and its downstream pathway. We reported here on the findings that a high
   level of serum ionized calcium was significantly correlated with
   advanced EC progression, and among all the calcium channels, TRPV4
   played an essential role, with high levels of TRPV4 expression
   associated with cancer progression both in vitro and in vivo. Proteomic
   and bioinformatics analysis revealed that TRPV4 was involved in
   cytoskeleton regulation and Rho protein pathway, which regulated EC cell
   migration. Mechanistic investigation demonstrated that TRPV4 and calcium
   influx acted on the cytoskeleton via the RhoA/ROCK1 pathway, ending with
   LIMK/cofilin activation, which had an impact on F-actin and paxillin
   (PXN) levels. Overall, our findings indicated that ionized serum calcium
   level was significantly associated with poor outcomes and calcium
   channel TRPV4 should be targeted to improve therapeutic and preventive
   strategies in EC.}},

Title = {{Long Noncoding RNA LINC01207 Promotes Colon Cancer Cell Proliferation
   and Invasion by Regulating miR-3125/TRIM22 Axis}},

Abstract = {{Increasing study has validated that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are
   involved in the growth and metastasis of colon cancer. LINC01207 has
   been reported to play vital roles in certain types of cancer, while the
   precise function of LINC01207 in the progression of colon cancer remains
   unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of
   LINC01207 on the growth and metastasis of colon cancer cells and to
   explore the underlying mechanism. We found that the expression of
   LINC01207 was significantly upregulated in colon adenocarcinoma tissues
   compared with normal tissues by the GEPIA database. Notably, silencing
   of LINC01207 significantly suppressed the proliferation, migration, and
   invasion abilities of SW480 and HT-29 cells. Mechanistically, our data
   demonstrated that LINC01207 could sponge miR-3125 in colon cancer cells.
   Moreover, miR-3125 could directly target TRIM22 and negatively regulate
   its expression. Rescue assays revealed that miR-3125 inhibitor or TRIM22
   overexpression significantly reversed the repressive role of LINC01207
   knockdown in colon cancer cell proliferation and invasion. In
   conclusion, LINC01207 exerts an oncogenic role in the progression of
   colon cancer by absorbing miR-3125 to modulating TRIM22 expression.}},

Title = {{Effect of contact geometry on the friction of acrylamide hydrogels with
   different surface structures}},
Journal = {{FRICTION}},
Abstract = {{Polyacrylamide (PAAm) hydrogels with brush-covered or crosslinked
   surfaces were produced and their tribological behavior was studied over
   a wide range of sliding speeds for two different contact geometries:
   sphere-on-flat and flat-pin-on-flat. Irrespective of the contact
   geometry, the brushy hydrogel surfaces displayed up to an order of
   magnitude lower coefficients of friction mu (COF) compared to the
   crosslinked surfaces, even achieving superlubricity (mu < 0.01). In
   general, a hydrogel sphere showed a lower coefficient of friction than a
   flat hydrogel pin at a similar contact pressure over the entire range of
   sliding speeds. However, after normalizing the friction force by the
   contact area, the shear stress of hydrogels with either crosslinked or
   brushy surfaces was found to be similar for both contact geometries at
   low speeds, indicating that hydrogel friction is unaffected by the
   contact geometry at these speeds. At high sliding speeds, the shear
   stress was found to be lower for a sphere-on-flat configuration compared
   to a flat-pin-on-flat configuration. This can be attributed to the
   larger equivalent hydrodynamic thickness due to the convergent inlet
   zone ahead of the sphere-on-flat contact, which presumably enhances the
   water supply in the contact, promotes rehydration, and thus reduces the
   friction at high sliding speeds compared to that measured for the
   flat-pin-on-flat contact.}},

Abstract = {{In order to improve the oxidation and wear resistance of blades tip of
   titanium alloys as well as the sealing performance of the gas turbine
   engine, a Ni/cBN abrasive coating was prepared on titanium alloys
   through composite electroplating. Oxidation, mechanical and tribological
   properties of the abrasive coating were investigated. Furthermore, the
   effect of the oxidation on the mechanical and tribological properties
   was also evaluated. Oxidation results revealed that the abrasive coating
   underwent slight oxidation within 700 degrees C. Meanwhile, some
   intermetallic compounds, Ni3Ti, NiTi and NiTi2, were formed at the
   coating/substrate interface during oxidation. Due to the pinning effect
   of cBN particles and the different thermal expansion coefficients of the
   coating and substrate, the coating/substrate interface was cracked after
   oxidation at 700 degrees C. Tensile results showed that the presence of
   coating reduced the strength of the alloy significantly at room
   temperature, while only marginal variations of the strength of the
   coated and uncoated specimens at elevated temperatures. Besides, the
   wear tests indicated that the coating had the excellent cutting ability
   and wear resistance, which can effectively protect the blades tip of
   titanium alloys. As the temperature increased, the wear resistance
   decreased due to the decrease in the mechanical properties of the Ni/cBN
   coating.}},

Abstract = {{A simple and highly selective electrochemical sensor based on carbonized
   lotus stem (CLS) was developed for the simultaneous determination of
   hydroquinone (HQ), catechol (CC), and nitrite (NT) by using cyclic
   voltammetry (CV) and amperometry (AMP) methods. The CLS was
   characterized by the methods including field emission scanning electron
   microscopy (FE-SEM), Raman spectrum, FT-IR spectrum and X-ray
   diffraction (XRD). Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method was used to
   evaluate the pore structure and surface area of CLS. The oxidation peaks
   for HQ (116.2 mV), CC (220.1 mV), and NT (818.9 mV) were well separated
   under optimized conditions, which improved their simultaneous
   determination. The CLS modified electrode showed a good linear range
   between 1.0x10 (-6) to 7.0x10 (-4) M for HQ, and the detection limit was
   calculated as 0.15 mu M. For CC the linear relationship was 1.0x10 (-6)
   to 3.0x10 (-3) M with the detection limit of 0.11 mu M. For NT the
   linear relationship was 5.0x10 (-7) to 4.0x10 (-3) M with the detection
   limit of 0.09 mu M. The results indicated that the intrinsic structure
   of natural biomass can be expected to design porous carbon for

Abstract = {{Posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) is a potentially
   fatal disorder arising after solid organ or hematopoietic cell
   transplantation. Survival rates of PTLD with diffuse large B-cell
   lymphoma (DLBCL) phenotype have improved due to the introduction of
   rituximab, however, reports on curative management of refractory PTLD
   are scarce. Here, we describe successful management of three patients
   with refractory EBV-negative PTLD with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell
   (CAR-T) therapy. All patients continued calcineurin inhibitors
   throughout the whole course of treatment. T-cell immunophenotyping was
   performed on both the apheresed cells and CAR-T product to investigate
   the T-cell compartment subpopulations. All three patients responded to a
   single infusion of tisagenlecleucel and two of them achieved CR.
   Toxicity profile was similar to other patients with non-PTLD DLBCL
   treated with CAR-T. No transplanted graft dysfunction was observed
   during the course of therapy. To our knowledge, this is the first report
   demonstrating that patients with EBV-negative refractory PTLD may
   benefit from CAR-T therapy, similarly to other patients with
   relapse/refractory DLBCL. A larger cohort of patients is needed to
   further establish proof-of-concept.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the optimal reinsurance and investment problem for

   Assuming that the insurer surplus process is approximated by Brownian

   asset whose price is modeled by constant elasticity variance (CEV)
   model. The insurer's objective is to maximize the expected fractional
   power utility from terminal wealth. The explicit expressions for optimal
   reinsurance-investment strategy and value function are determined by the
   stochastic approach, which uses the equations of
   Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman. Finally, the numerical simulations are
   presented to show the effects of model parameters on the insurer's
   optimal reinsurance and investment strategies.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, human skin fibroblasts human dermis fibroblasts were used
   as the object, the possible effects and mechanisms of rosemary extract
   on repeated exposure to Ultraviolet A (UVA) induced senescence of human
   skin fibroblasts were investigated. During the research, we mainly
   carried out through two parts. The first part mainly explores the effect
   of repeated UVA radiation on human skin fibroblasts; the second part
   mainly discusses the effect of rosemary extract on the induction of
   human skin formation by repeated UVA radiation. The results showed that
   repeated UVA irradiation of human skin fibroblasts can induce aging
   phenomena, such as slow proliferation and an increase in
   beta-galactosidase staining positive rate; repeated exposure of rosemary
   extract to low-dose UVA can slow down human skin fibroblasts to age. Its
   mechanism may be related to reducing the total intracellular ROS, the
   mRNA expression of MMP-1 and MMP-3, and the expression of p53 protein.
   In short, this study provides a new approach and theoretical basis for
   the development and application of natural sunscreens.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundAccess to drugs with hospital-restricted dispensation, such as
   those for patients with rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis, is regulated
   by healthcare policy. These drugs have the greatest cost-effective
   impact on the healthcare system. This is why a model for Pharmaceutical
   Care based on follow-up teleconsultations was defined in our hospital to
   improve patient well-being. Objective To evaluate clinical changes on
   patients when our remote Pharmaceutical Care model is applied and
   describe the work carried out by pharmacists when applying it. Setting
   Pharmacy Department of a Hospital in Barcelona, Spain. Method
   Cross-sectional observational study of the remote Pharmaceutical Care
   model developed by Clinical Pharmacists. All patients diagnosed with
   psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis who were receiving active treatment
   with Hospital/Specialist only drugs, during the period from May to
   December 2018, were included. Main outcome measures The corresponding
   healthcare activity was recorded and to determine the utility of the
   model, the clinical response to treatment of patients included in the
   study was recorded. Results The implementation of teleconsultation is
   statistically related to the biological treatment response of patients
   with psoriasis (p = 0.006) and rheumatoid arthritis (p = 0.019). In
   those patients the healthcare activity of calculating and/or recording
   clinical variables of effectiveness/safety is statistically associated
   to biological treatment response (65.62\% vs 35\%, p = 0.015 and 73.14\%
   vs 53.26\%, p = 0.003). Conclusions The implementation of the model
   described lends added value to traditional pharmacotherapeutic
   management of biological treatments in patients with rheumatoid
   arthritis and psoriasis since response is improved but patient
   well-being is not diminished.}},

Title = {{Factors influencing water immersion during labour: qualitative case
   studies of six maternity units in the United Kingdom}},
Journal = {{BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundWater immersion during labour can provide benefits including
   reduced need for regional analgesia and a shorter labour. However, in
   the United Kingdom a minority of women use a pool for labour or birth,
   with pool use particularly uncommon in obstetric-led settings. Maternity
   unit culture has been identified as an important influence on pool use,
   but this and other possible factors have not been explored in-depth.
   Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify factors influencing
   pool use through qualitative case studies of three obstetric units and
   three midwifery units in the UK.MethodsCase study units with a range of
   waterbirth rates and representing geographically diverse locations were
   selected. Data collection methods comprised semi-structured interviews,
   collation of service documentation and public-facing information, and
   observations of the unit environment. There were 111 interview
   participants, purposively sampled to include midwives, postnatal women,
   obstetricians, neonatologists, midwifery support workers and doulas. A
   framework approach was used to analyse all case study
   data.ResultsObstetric unit culture was a key factor restricting pool
   use. We found substantial differences between obstetric and midwifery
   units in terms of equipment and resources, staff attitudes and
   confidence, senior staff support and women's awareness of water
   immersion. Generic factors influencing use of pools across all units
   included limited access to waterbirth training, sociodemographic
   differences in desire for pool use and issues using waterproof fetal
   monitoring equipment.ConclusionsCase study findings provide new insights
   into the influence of maternity unit culture on waterbirth rates. Access
   to pool use could be improved through midwives based in obstetric units
   having more experience of waterbirth, providing obstetricians and
   neonatologists with information on the practicalities of pool use and
   improving accessibility of antenatal information. In terms of resources,
   recommendations include increasing pool provision, ensuring birth room
   allocation maximises the use of unit resources, and providing pool room
   environments that are acceptable to midwives.}},

Abstract = {{Background The directionality of associations between self-regulatory
   variables, behavior, and automaticity is seldomly tested. In this study,
   we aimed to examine a volitional, self-regulatory sequence of variables
   proposed in the Health Action Process Approach framework (intention ->
   action plans -> action control -> behavior) and its relationship with
   the construct of automaticity of the physical activity habit. Methods
   Longitudinal data was collected from high school students (N = 203,
   M-age = 15.39 (SD = 1.43), 52\% women) at three measurement points.
   First, a confirmatory factor analysis measurement model was used to
   examine the study variables across measurement points. Next, a
   cross-lagged panel model was used to test directionality between
   variables. Results After adequate fit of the measurement model was
   confirmed, a mechanism integrating self-regulation with behavior and
   automaticity was examined. The hypothesized directionality between
   variables was verified overall by cross-lagged analysis. However, for
   the intention-action plan association, the inverse relationship was
   found: plans were associated with subsequent intentions, but intentions
   did not predict plans. Moreover, automaticity was not associated with
   subsequent physical activity behavior. Conclusions In general, our
   findings supported the hypothesized longitudinal direction of the
   associations, confirming that self-regulation may lead to behavior
   performance and automaticity. Unexpected findings and implications for
   intervention and future research are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A gold-catalyzed synthesis of 1,3-dihydrooxazolo{[}3,4-a]indoles from

   presents the first examples that internal alkynes can react with
   nitrones to undergo an oxoarylation route. DFT calculations indicate a
   {[}3,3]-sigmatropic shift of initial alkenylgold intermediates to elude
   the intermediacy of gold carbenes. We also developed new
   {[}3+2]-annulations of the same 1-oxo-3-yn-4-ols with imines, yielding
   oxazolidin-4-ylidene derivatives efficiently. The tethered alcohols of
   these 1-oxo-3-ynes allow trapping of their metastable 2-azadienium
   intermediates to enable a novel annulation. Our mechanistic analysis
   indicates that the two products, despite their structural relevance, are
   produced from two independent systems.}},

Abstract = {{The dissolved (d) and total dissolvable (td) trace metals were
   determined in seawater samples collected from the East China Sea (ECS).
   Labile particulate (lp) species was calculated as td minus d, and the
   sectional and vertical distributions of d and lp trace metals were
   evaluated. The surface concentrations of dAl, dCo, dNi, dCu, and dPb
   were higher in the continental shelf region than in the Kuroshio region.
   lpAl and lpFe were the dominant species below a depth of 400 m, and a
   strong positive correlation was observed between them in the Kuroshio
   region. The enrichment factor (EF) against crustal abundance was
   calculated for the purpose of estimating the origin of dMs in the ECS.
   The EF(dFe) was close to unity. These results suggest that both lpFe and
   dFe are dominated by crustal sources. The other elements had high EF,
   indicating significant contributions from other sources. EF(dPb) was
   close to the enrichment factor in aerosol, suggesting atmospheric input
   from anthropogenic sources. The dM/P ratios were calculated to
   investigate the validity of the extended Redfield ratio in the ECS. The
   Mn/P, Co/P, Cu/P, Zn/P, and Cd/P ratios in shallow water (< 200 m) were
   within the same order of magnitude as those in phytoplankton. In
   contrast, the Al/P and Fe/P ratios were, respectively, 27 and 213 times
   higher in phytoplankton compared to those in shallow water. These
   results suggest that dFe is a potential limiting factor for biological
   production, although it is not exhausted in surface water.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to compare shaping abilities of Protaper Gold
   (R) (PTG) and 2Shape (R) (TS) by using a new automatic process and
   micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT). 32 first mandibular molars with
   two separate mesial canals were selected. Only mesial roots were
   prepared with PTG and TS. Pre- and post-operative scans were performed
   using Micro-CT to provide volumes with a voxel size of 20 mu m. Volumes,
   non-instrumented area, amount of transportation and centering ability in
   coronal, middle and apical third shaping time and procedural errors were
   recorded. TS and PTG increased the endodontic volume of 2.98 mm(3) (+/-
   1.56) and 3.21 mm(3) (+/- 1.78) respectively with no statistical
   difference (p = .168) and no procedural errors. No significant
   difference was found concerning canal transportation among groups but
   only within the same group PTG (p value < .001) and TS (p value < .001).
   The mean centering ratio was significantly different only between the
   section levels for PTG (p value < .001) and TS (p value = .01); it was
   significantly reduced in the cervical third. The percentage of untouched
   canal walls ranged between 29.78\% (+/- 15.145) and 36.60\% (+/- 11.968)
   respectively for PTG and TS with no statistical difference among groups
   (p value = .168). TS and PTG with post machining heat treatment were
   able to produce centered preparations with no significant difference or
   procedural errors. TS system provided a shorter preparation time than
   PTG files.}},

Title = {{Different dimensions of social support differentially predict
   psychological well-being in late life: opposite effects of perceived
   emotional support and marital status on symptoms of anxiety and of
   depression in older outpatients in Italy}},

Abstract = {{Background Social support is important to psychological well-being in
   late life. However, findings in the literature regarding its effects are
   mixed, less information is available for anxiety than for depressive
   symptoms, and few studies have been carried out in Italy. Therefore, the
   aim of this study was to investigate the influence of social support on
   symptoms of anxiety and of depression in a sample of geriatric
   outpatients in Italy.
   Methods This cross-sectional study consecutively enrolled 299
   outpatients without dementia (age >= 65, all neuropsychologically
   tested). Social support was assessed with the ENRICHD Social Support
   Instrument and by interview. Symptoms of anxiety and of depression were
   evaluated with short versions of the State-Trait Personality Inventory
   Trait Anxiety and Geriatric Depression scales. The relationship between
   social support and psychological well-being was examined by multiple
   linear regression models with socio-demographic and clinical variables,
   including cognitive performance, as potential confounders.
   Results Perceived emotional support was a negative predictor of symptoms
   of anxiety (standardised beta coefficient (beta) -0.288, standard error
   (SE) 0.074, P < 0.001) and symptoms of depression (beta -0.196, SE
   0.040, P < 0.001). On the contrary, marital status (i.e. being married)
   was a positive predictor of symptoms of anxiety (beta 0.199, SE 0.728, P
   = 0.003) and symptoms of depression (beta 0.142, SE 0.384, P = 0.035).
   Conclusions Different dimensions of social support differentially affect
   psychological well-being. The protective effect of perceived emotional
   support is consistent with social cognitive models of health. The
   harmful effect of being married may be capturing the distress of the
   pre-bereavement period. Alternatively, it may reflect oppression by
   gender roles within marriage in a predominantly female sample in a
   traditional society. Our findings provide insight into the relationship
   between social support and psychological well-being, and identify
   potential targets for psychosocial interventions promoting mental health
   in late life.}},

Journal = {{BMC GASTROENTEROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: There are often specific endoscopic findings caused by
   deposition of lanthanum (La) in the gastric mucosa of patients taking
   lanthanum carbonate (LaC), a novel phosphate binder for patients on
   hemodialysis. We conducted a retrospective study to investigate the
   clinical significance of La deposition in the gastric mucosa, and the
   association between endoscopic features and histologic findings in the
   same population.
   Methods: We compared background factors in patients taking LaC with and
   without La deposition in their gastroscopic biopsy specimen. We also
   investigated the relationship between gastric endoscopic biopsy
   specimens with La deposition and the concurrent endoscopic images.
   Results: There was a significant difference in the total dose of LaC
   between the La-positive and La-negative groups (990 g {[}180-3150 g] vs.
   480 g {[}225-1328 g]; p = 0.013). In 27 biopsy specimens with specific
   whitish mucosa, 10 showed mild histiocytic infiltration and 17 showed
   severe infiltration. In contrast, among 24 specimens with non-whitish
   mucosa, 5 showed no histiocytic infiltration, 10 showed mild
   infiltration, and 9 showed severe infiltration. There was a significant
   relationship between endoscopic features and the degree of histiocytic
   infiltration (p = 0.026).
   Conclusions: We demonstrated that La deposition in the gastric mucosa
   depended on the total dose of LaC and was not affected by background
   factors. The specific endoscopic features of La deposition are
   associated with the infiltration of histiocytes, which represents the
   body's normal response to foreign bodies.

Title = {{Evaluation of the critical success factors for sustainable housing
   delivery: analytic hierarchy process approach}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   Despite the varied housing policies guiding the Nigerian housing
   provision, its delivery is yet to level up with the global acceptable
   sustainability requirements. Previous studies revealed that developing
   countries are yet to unravel and embrace the tenets of sustainable
   housing delivery. This study, therefore, adopted the analytic hierarchy
   process survey in evaluating the critical success factors (CSFs) that
   can enhance the delivery of sustainable housing and, in turn, meeting
   the nation's sustainable housing needs.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Data for the study was sourced from housing developers in Nigeria. A
   pilot survey was done to reduce the identified success factors into a
   manageable size. These factors were evaluated using the analytical
   hierarchy process to ascertain the significant factors for sustainable
   housing delivery in developing economies.
   Findings
   Findings from the study revealed that government funding towards
   sustainable housing, access to low-interest housing loan, mandating
   affordable housing development, ensuring community participation during
   housing delivery, the involvement of housing stakeholders, ensuring the
   security of life and properties, use of sustainable materials, adaptable
   housing design and befitting land use are the significant CSFs required
   for enhancing sustainable housing delivery.
   Practical implications
   The findings of this study seek to inform developers, practitioners and
   policymakers on the CSFs crucial for sustainability attainment in the
   built environment.
   Originality/value
   The CSFs are quite important and they would promote government
   sustainability programmes, meeting housing needs and if well implemented
   and adopted thereby solving environmental and socio-economic challenges
   of traditional housing development. This research has added to the
   existing literature on sustainable housing delivery by providing
   information on inclusive CSFs that would enhance the delivery of
   sustainable housing in the developing economy. Further research of this
   nature can also be carried out to compare and contrast with other
   developing economies.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FINANCE \& ECONOMICS}},
Abstract = {{We use a financial development indicator to revisit the relationship of
   financial development and financial structure with economic growth. The
   financial development indicator simultaneously takes into account
   accessibility, depth and financial efficiency for the period 1980-2017
   for Sub-Saharan Africa countries. The continuously updated fully
   modified (Cup-FM) and continuously updated bias corrected (Cup-BC)
   estimators, as well as the panel smooth transition regression (PSTR),
   were used to examine the linear and nonlinear effects of financial
   development and financial structure on economic growth. For low-income
   countries, the Cup-FM and the Cup-BC estimators indicate that the
   financial system relies on financial markets. The findings obtains
   through the PSTR model confirm this conclusion when the financial market
   represents more than 34\% of financial institutions. For middle-income
   countries, the Cup-FM and Cup-BC estimators reveal that the financial
   system relies on banking industry. However, this result is not supported
   by the PSTR model. In fact, it indicates that the financial system in
   these countries is based on financial markets when government
   expenditure as percentage of gross domestic product is less than 2.62\%.
   Above this threshold, the financial system depends on the development of
   financial services, legal and regulatory framework.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to experimentally determine the effect of
   silica nanoparticles (NS) on the buckling characteristics of
   Kevlar/epoxy fiber reinforced composite laminates. The composite samples
   with different weight fractions of NS particles, namely 0.0, 0.5, 1.0,
   1.5 and 2.5 wt\%, were prepared by vacuum assisted resin transfer
   molding (VARTM) and subjected to axial and lateral buckling tests.
   Additionally, the buckling tests were performed on the samples with
   different lengths (125, 150, 175, 200 and 225 mm) to analyze in more
   detail the influence of NS fractions on axial and lateral buckling
   performances. Morphology and failure mechanisms of the samples were
   analyzed using scanning electron microscopy images of critical regions
   of each sample. The results showed that the incorporation of NS
   particles led to higher critical buckling load values for both axial and
   lateral buckling. The highest critical buckling load values for both
   axial and lateral buckling events were observed for 1.5 wt\% NS particle
   content in Kevlar/epoxy composite laminates. Further increasing of NS
   resulted with the decrements in critical buckling loads because of poor
   interfacial bonding between NS particles and epoxy resin, primarily due
   to onset of agglomeration. As it is expected the decreases in length of
   samples resulted with significant increases in both the axial and
   lateral buckling characteristics. The results of this research can be
   used to design composites with high buckling resistance, especially for
   applications where loading may compromise structural stability and
   functionality, such as tall buildings, structural bridges and roofs,

Title = {{Comparing Precarious Employment Across Countries: Measurement Invariance
   of the Employment Precariousness Scale for Europe (EPRES-E)}},
Journal = {{SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{154}},
Number = {{3, SI}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Comparing precarious employment (PE) across countries is essential to
   deepen the understanding of the phenomenon and to learn from
   country-specific experiences. However, this is hampered by the lack of
   internationally meaningful measures of PE. We aim to address this point
   by assessing the measurement invariance (MI) of the Employment
   Precariousness Scale for Europe (EPRES-E), an adaptation of the EPRES
   construct in the European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS). EPRES-E
   consists of 13 proxy-indicators sorted into six dimensions:
   temporariness, disempowerment, vulnerability, wages, exercise of rights,
   unpredictable working times. Drawing on EWCS-2015, MI of the
   second-order factor model was tested in a sample of 31,340 formal
   employees by means of (a) multi-group confirmatory factor analyses, and
   (b) the substantive exploration of EPRES-E mean scores in each country.
   The results demonstrate that threshold invariance holds for the
   first-order structure (dimensions) of 22 countries (Austria, Belgium,
   Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania,
   Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia,
   Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK), but only metric invariance is
   attained by the second-order structure. The latter is supported by the
   exploration of mean scores, where we found that different score patterns
   in each dimension lead to similar overall EPRES-E scores, suggesting
   that PE is configured by different sources within the six dimensions in

   conclude that, although EPRES-E can be used for comparative purposes in
   22 European countries, the scores of each dimension must be reported

Abstract = {{Despite the growing number of researches about performance-based
   accountability (PBA) in education, there is still scarce evidence on the
   mediating role of subjective variables (e.g., perceived pressure and
   alignment to PBA mandates) in the enactment of PBA in socially
   disadvantaged contexts. This is paradoxical because marginalized schools
   are usually those that are on probation and have to cope with the threat
   of sanctions more frequently. Existing investigations on PBA enactment
   have put increasing attention to the role of situated and material
   contexts, but there is still limited knowledge on how subjective
   variables can mediate policy enactment processes and enable the adoption
   of different school responses. To address these gaps, the article aims
   to explore how the perceived accountability pressure, the school
   performative culture, and meaning-making processes at the school level
   are mediating the enactment of PBA policies in disadvantaged schools. At
   the theoretical level, the study is informed by sense-making and policy
   enactment frameworks. Methodologically speaking, the investigation uses
   a comparative case study approach based on two extreme cases, which have
   been selected on the basis of a factorial analysis that combines both
   survey and secondary data. The extreme cases represent two different
   scenarios, which, despite operating in similar situated contexts, are
   characterized by having opposite levels of perceived pressure and
   alignment with the performative culture. The case studies combine survey
   data (n = 39) with documentary analysis and semi-structured interviews
   with the management team and teachers (n = 7). The findings show that
   subjective variables, in interaction with other contextual factors, can
   exacerbate or inhibit PBA regulatory pressures and trigger diverging
   school responses.}},

Title = {{The sensitivity of qSOFA calculated at triage and during emergency

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{The quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score has been
   proposed as a means to rapidly identify adult patients with suspected
   infection, in pre-hospital, Emergency Department (ED), or general
   hospital ward locations, who are in a high-risk category with increased
   likelihood of ``poor outcomes:{''} a greater than 10\% chance of dying
   or an increased likelihood of spending 3 or more days in the ICU. This
   score is intended to replace the use of systemic inflammatory response
   syndrome (SIRS) criteria as a screening tool; however, its role in ED
   screening and identification has yet to be fully elucidated. In this
   retrospective observational study, we explored the performance of triage
   qSOFA (tqSOFA), maximum qSOFA, and first initial serum lactate (>3
   mmol/L) at predicting in-hospital mortality and compared these results
   to those for the initial SIRS criteria obtained in triage. A total of
   2859 sepsis cases were included and the in-hospital mortality rate was
   14.4\%. The sensitivity of tqSOFA >= 2 and maximum qSOFA >= 2 to predict
   in-hospital mortality were 33\% and 69\%, respectively. For comparison,
   the triage SIRS criteria and the initial lactate>3 mmol/L had
   sensitivities of 82\% and 65\%, respectively. These results demonstrate
   that in a large ED sepsis database the earliest measurement of end organ
   impairment, tqSOFA, performed poorly at identifying patients at
   increased risk of mortality and maximum qSOFA did not significantly
   outperform initial serum lactate levels.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays the intelligent system is used to support learning. The
   Intelligent Problem Solver (IPS) in education is a system which can
   solve problems automatically, and its proofs are step-by-step and

   geometry, besides the solution, the figure helps to imagine and grasp
   the important information from the problem. In this paper, an IPS in
   Plane Geometry is constructed. This system can give the solution to a
   problem with its visual figure. The knowledge model of relations
   (Rela-model) is applied to represent the knowledge base of plane
   geometry. The relational network representing the relations between
   geometric objects is the combination between Rela-model and conceptual
   graph. This network is used to design algorithms for automatic drawing
   of the figure. Rela-model with related problems is used to design
   algorithms for solving geometry problems. The IPS in plane geometry can
   solve common exercises in the mathematical curriculum at Vietnamese
   middle-school and it is useful to support the learning of pupils.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Postharvest lenticel discoloration (LD) deteriorates the external
   appearance of mango fruit and is supposed to be associated with
   biochemical changes in fruit peel. Hence, an experiment was executed to
   ascertain the relationship between biochemical parameters such as
   polyphenol oxidase (PPO), peroxidase (POD), lipoxygenase (LOX), total
   phenol content (TPC) and fruit quality parameters i.e., external appeal
   of fruit (EAF), total soluble solids (TSS), total carotenoids (TC) to
   the incidence of LD. 30 (20 indigenous and 10 exotic) commercial mango
   varieties of India grown at ICAR-IARI, New Delhi, were harvested at full
   maturity and stored at ambient conditions (24 +/- 4 oC, 75 +/- 5\% RH)
   for 10 days. During the storage duration, fruit analyzed for LD (\%),
   biochemical and quality parameters. Results revealed significant
   correlations existed between LD \% and biochemical parameters as LD vs
   PPO (r(2) = + 0.98), LD vs POD (r(2) = + 0.79), LD vs LOX (r(2) = +
   0.70) were found to be positively correlated, while LD vs TPC was
   negatively correlated. Similarly, among the quality parameters, LD found
   to have no relation with internal quality i.e., TSS (r(2) = + 0.08) and
   TC (r(2) = + 0.2), whereas negatively correlated with external quality
   i.e., EAF (r(2) = - 0.71). Our findings suggest that monitory loss of
   mango growers because of LD is solely due to deterioration of external
   quality. LD does not have any impact on internal/nutritional quality.
   Furthermore, the positive relationship of LD \% with enzymes suggests
   their role and biochemical basis in causation and control of LD.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND CONTROL}},
Abstract = {{Relative vibration between the cutter and workpiece has an influence on
   the surface generation and dimensional accuracy. In the present work,
   prediction models were developed for roundness and surface roughness of
   hole in terms of amplitude and frequency of tool vibration. The proposed
   methodology carried out a theoretical investigation on the effect of
   tool vibration components in X- and Y-directions on the mill cutter end
   point to estimate hole roundness and surface roughness. Series of
   helical milling experiments were conducted at different levels of
   spindle rotational speed, cutter orbital speed, and axial depth of cuts
   using 10- mm and 8- mm diameter mill cutters on Inconel 718. Predicted
   values of the roundness and surface roughness of hole were compared with
   predicted values and verified accuracy of the proposed prediction
   models. The experimental results indicate a good agreement with the
   predicted value. At spindle rotational speed of 2000 r/min and cutter
   orbital speed of 50 r/min, the measured and predicted values of the
   roundness were found to be almost same as the required roundness. The
   surface roughness was found to be very less at 50 r/min of cutter

Title = {{A Code-Agnostic Driver Application for Coupled Neutronics and

Journal = {{NUCLEAR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{195}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{391-411}},
Month = {{APR 3}},
Abstract = {{While the literature has numerous examples of Monte Carlo (MC) and
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) coupling, most are hardwired codes
   intended primarily for research rather than as stand-alone,
   general-purpose applications. In this work, we describe an open source
   application, the Exascale Nuclear Reactor Investigative COde (ENRICO),
   which enables coupled neutronic and thermal-hydraulic simulations
   between multiple codes that can be chosen at run time (as opposed to a
   coupling between two specific codes). The application has been designed
   such that the control flow logic, domain mapping, nonlinear fixed-point
   iteration, solution transfers, and convergence checks are all agnostic
   to the underlying physics solvers used. Special emphasis has also been
   placed on enabling efficient execution on distributed-memory computing
   environments. The transfer of solution fields between solvers is
   performed in memory rather than through filesystem input/output.
   Additionally, solvers can be configured to run on overlapping or
   disjoint sets of processes.
   To date, coupling with the OpenMC and Shift MC codes, the Nek5000 CFD
   code, and a simplified heat diffusion and subchannel solver has been
   implemented in ENRICO. We present results for coupled simulations of a
   single light water reactor fuel assembly based on the NuScale reactor
   using various combinations of the physics solvers. For this problem, the
   coupled simulations are shown to converge in about four Picard
   iterations. A comparison of the heat source and temperature
   distributions computed by ENRICO using OpenMC coupled with Nek5000 and
   Shift coupled with Nek5000 illustrates remarkable agreement between the
   codes.}},

Abstract = {{We study the transport properties of a hybrid junction made of a
   ferromagnetic lead in electrical connection with the helical edge modes
   of a two-dimensional topological insulator. In this system, the
   time-reversal symmetry, which characterizes the ballistic edge modes of
   the topological insulator, is explicitly broken inside the ferromagnetic
   region. This conflict situation generates unusual transport phenomena at
   the interface which are the manifestation of the interplay between the
   spin polarization of the injected current and the spin-momentum locking
   mechanism operating inside the topological insulator. We show that the
   spin-polarized current originated in the ferromagnetic region is
   asymmetrically divided in spatially separated branch currents sustained
   by edge channels with different helicity inside the topological
   insulator. The above findings provide the working principle of a
   topological current divider in which the relative intensity of the
   branch currents is determined by the polarization of the incoming
   current. We discuss the relevance of this effect in spintronics where,
   for instance, it offers an alternative way to measure the current
   polarization generated by a ferromagnetic electrode.}},

Title = {{An Updated Guideline for Assessing Discriminant Validity}},
Journal = {{ORGANIZATIONAL RESEARCH METHODS}},
Abstract = {{Discriminant validity was originally presented as a set of empirical
   criteria that can be assessed from multitrait-multimethod (MTMM)
   matrices. Because datasets used by applied researchers rarely lend
   themselves to MTMM analysis, the need to assess discriminant validity in
   empirical research has led to the introduction of numerous techniques,
   some of which have been introduced in an ad hoc manner and without
   rigorous methodological support. We review various definitions of and
   techniques for assessing discriminant validity and provide a generalized
   definition of discriminant validity based on the correlation between two
   measures after measurement error has been considered. We then review
   techniques that have been proposed for discriminant validity assessment,
   demonstrating some problems and equivalencies of these techniques that
   have gone unnoticed by prior research. After conducting Monte Carlo
   simulations that compare the techniques, we present techniques called
   CICFA(sys) and chi(2)(sys) that applied researchers can use to assess
   discriminant validity.}},

   surveillance: a global analysis}},
Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{19}},

Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundSolving the problem of malaria requires a highly skilled
   workforce with robust infrastructure, financial backing and sound
   programme management coordinated by a strategic plan. Here, the capacity
   of National Malaria Control Programmes (NMCPs) was analysed to identify
   the strengths and weaknesses underpinning the implementation of vector
   surveillance and control activities by the core elements of programme
   capacity, being strategic frameworks, financing, human resources,
   logistics and infrastructure, and information systems.ResultsAcross
   nearly every country surveyed, the vector surveillance programmes were
   hampered by a lack of capacity and capability. Only 8\% of NMCPs
   reported having sufficient capacity to implement vector surveillance. In
   contrast, 57\%, 56\% and 28\% of NMCPs had the capacity to implement
   long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), indoor residual spraying (IRS)
   and larval source management (LSM) activities, respectively. Largely
   underlying this was a lack of up-to-date strategic plans that prioritize
   vector surveillance and include frameworks for decision-making and
   action.ConclusionsStrategic planning and a lack of well-trained
   entomologists heavily hamper vector surveillance. Countries on the path
   to elimination generally had more operational/field staff compared to
   countries at the stage of control, and also were more likely to have an
   established system for staff training and capacity building. It is
   unlikely that controlling countries will make significant progress
   unless huge investments also go towards increasing the number and
   capacity of programmatic staff.}},

   <32 Weeks' Gestation}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Objective This study aimed to evaluate associations between leukopenia
   or neutropenia at birth and risk of sepsis in very preterm neonates.
   Study Design We conducted a retrospective unmatched cohort study of
   neonates of <32 weeks' gestation. Those with leukopenia (<= 5,000/mu L)
   were compared with a unmatched cohort without leukopenia. Comparisons
   were also made for patients with neutropenia and without neutropenia.
   The outcomes were early-onset sepsis, late-onset sepsis, and mortality.
   Results We identified 271 neonates with leukopenia at birth and 271
   without. Multivariable analyses identified higher odds of early-onset
   sepsis (adjusted odds ratio {[}AOR] = 4.85, 95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI]: 1.29-18.20) in leukopenic neonates. Of neonates with leukopenia,
   183 had both leukopenia and neutropenia and were associated with the
   highest odds of early-onset sepsis (AOR = 6.94, 95\% CI: 1.77-27.15)

Abstract = {{Firefighting is classified as a 2B-possibly carcinogenic profession by
   the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Firefighters are
   exposed to a host of toxic fireground contaminants such as phenols,
   phthalates, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), many of which
   are potentially carcinogenic. Studies show that the exposure to
   contaminated firefighter gear postfire poses a health risk to the
   firefighters. This study focused on the issue of contaminants being
   present on the gear and developing a thermal extraction method to
   perform the assessment. A headspace sampler (HS) connected to a gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) system was used to thermally
   extract known fireground contaminants and understand the effect of
   equilibration time and temperature on the thermal extraction
   efficiencies. The outer shell fabric samples (PBI/Kevlar blend) were
   spiked with known amounts of fireground chemicals, heated at various
   temperatures (36, 50, 100, and 200 degrees C), and analyzed using the
   developed method to calculate extraction efficiencies. This study is one
   of the first to utilize the all-in-one HS-GC-MS instrument to analyze
   the thermal extraction of a variety of fireground contaminants relative
   to different temperatures from firefighter gear materials. Based on the
   conditions evaluated, the results indicate that the 200 degrees C
   condition allowed for the maximum thermal extraction of contaminants
   from the outer shell material. The data collected from this study pave a
   way of creating a new method for the analysis of volatile and
   semivolatile contaminants from field-contaminated firefighter turnout
   material using HS-GC-MS.}},

Title = {{Identification of transcription factor co-regulators that drive prostate
   cancer progression}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{In prostate cancer (PCa), and many other hormone-dependent cancers,
   there is clear evidence for distorted transcriptional control as disease
   driver mechanisms. Defining which transcription factor (TF) and
   coregulators are altered and combine to become oncogenic drivers remains
   a challenge, in part because of the multitude of TFs and coregulators
   and the diverse genomic space on which they function. The current study
   was undertaken to identify which TFs and coregulators are commonly
   altered in PCa. We generated unique lists of TFs (n=2662), coactivators
   (COA; n=766); corepressors (COR; n=599); mixed function coregulators
   (MIXED; n=511), and to address the challenge of defining how these genes
   are altered we tested how expression, copy number alterations and
   mutation status varied across seven prostate cancer (PCa) cohorts (three
   of localized and four advanced disease). Testing of significant changes
   was undertaken by bootstrapping approaches and the most significant
   changes were identified. For one commonly and significantly altered gene
   were stably knocked-down expression and undertook cell biology
   experiments and RNA-Seq to identify differentially altered gene networks
   and their association with PCa progression risks. COAS, CORS, MIXED and
   TFs all displayed significant down-regulated expression (q.value<0.1)
   and correlated with protein expression (r 0.4-0.55). In localized PCa,
   stringent expression filtering identified commonly altered TFs and
   coregulator genes, including well-established (e.g. ERG) and
   underexplored (e.g. PPARGC1A, encodes PGC1 alpha). Reduced PPARGC1A
   expression significantly associated with worse disease-free survival in
   two cohorts of localized PCa. Stable PGC1 alpha knockdown in LNCaP cells
   increased growth rates and invasiveness and RNA-Seq revealed a profound
   basal impact on gene expression (similar to 2300 genes; FDR<0.05,
   logFC>1.5), but only modestly impacted PPAR gamma responses. GSEA
   analyses of the PGC1 alpha transcriptome revealed that it significantly
   altered the AR-dependent transcriptome, and was enriched for epigenetic
   modifiers. PGC1 alpha-dependent genes were overlapped with PGC1
   alpha-ChIP-Seq genes and significantly associated in TCGA with higher
   grade tumors and worse disease-free survival. These methods and data
   demonstrate an approach to identify cancer-driver coregulators in
   cancer, and that PGC1 alpha expression is clinically significant yet
   underexplored coregulator in aggressive early stage PCa.}},

   a nitrogen atom abstraction to produce linear N-3. The distinction
   between N-3 formed by UV radiated ices and other sources of energy is
   presented and rationalized. Among other results, we predict that the N-3

   Evidence for Reciprocal Relations and Differential Gender and Age
   Effects}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Toddlerhood is characterized by rapid development in several domains,
   such as language, socio-emotional behavior and emerging math skills all
   of which are important precursors of school readiness. However, little
   is known about how these skills develop over time and how they may be
   interrelated. The current study investigates young children's
   development at two time points, with about 7 months in between,
   assessing their language, socio-emotional and math language and numeracy
   skills with teacher ratings. The sample includes 577 children from 18
   until 36 months of age of 86 childcare classrooms. The results of the
   autoregressive path analyses showed moderate to strong stability of
   language, socio-emotional and math language and numeracy skills,
   although the magnitude of associations was smaller for the latter. The
   cross-lagged path analyses highlighted the importance of language and
   socio-emotional skills for development in the other domains.
   Differential relations were found for the autoregressive and
   cross-lagged paths depending on gender and age. Language skills appeared
   a stronger predictor of boys' socio-emotional and math language and
   numeracy skill development compared to girls. Girls' socio-emotional
   skills predicted growth in math. For boys, socio-emotional and math
   language and numeracy skills appeared to be unrelated. Language skills
   showed stronger relations with the development of math language and
   numeracy skills for younger children as compared to older children.
   Also, for older children math language and numeracy skills negatively
   predicted growth in their socio-emotional skills. The findings provide
   more insights in how language, math language and numeracy skills and
   socio-emotional skills co-develop in the early years and as such have
   important implications for interventions aimed to support children's
   development.}},

Abstract = {{The JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway may be aberrantly activated and have
   various and conflicting roles in breast cancer. The current study
   explored prognostic implications of activated STAT3 in human epidermal
   growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive primary breast cancers in the
   context of a large prospective study (ALTTO). Activated STAT3 was
   determined by immunohistochemical analysis of STAT3 phosphorylation
   (Y705) performed on the primary tumors. This analysis evaluated whether
   patients with activated STAT3 had disease-free survival (DFS) and
   overall survival (OS) different from patients without activated STAT3. A
   total of 5694 patients out of the 8381 patients enrolled in ALTTO were
   included in this analysis (67.9\%), and 2634 of them (46\%) had evidence
   of STAT3 activation (minimum tumor Allred score >= 2). The median
   follow-up was 6.93 years (6.85-6.97 years), at the end of which 1035
   (18.18\%) and 520 (9.13\%) patients experienced DFS and OS events,
   respectively. Patients with STAT3 activation experienced improved DFS
   compared to those without it (multivariable hazard ratio {[}HR], 0.84;
   95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 0.74-0.95; P = .006). There were no
   group differences in OS (multivariable HR, 0.92; 95\% CI 0.78-1.10; P =
   .37). This effect was limited to ER-positive tumors. In conclusion,
   these findings support the role of STAT3 activation as a marker of
   favorable outcome in ER-positive/HER2-positive breast cancer patients.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The usage of radioactive Technetium(99m) (Tc-99m) colloid for
   the purpose of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in early breast cancer
   is considered the gold standard in Germany. However, new tracers, such
   as near-infrared (NIR) imaging agents like indocyanine green (ICG) could
   offer an alternative in future, as they overcome drawbacks associated
   with radioactive Technetium(99m) (Tc-99m) like limited availability,
   high costs and radioactivity exposure for both patients and surgeons.
   Methods In this double-arm retrospective study, we sought to establish
   the usefulness of indocyanine green as an alternative or an addition to
   the conventional Technetium(99m) (Tc-99m) in the identification of the
   SLN in early breast cancer. Results Among the 161 patients who underwent
   primary SLNB, 34 patients had at least 1 SLN with metastasis. Among
   these patients with SLN metastasis, 33 had the SLN detected by ICG;
   while 31 had the SLN detected by Tc-99m. The conventional
   Technetium(99m) radiotracer failed to detect 2 patients with metastasis
   in this Arm of the study. Among the 87 patients who underwent SLNB after
   NACT, 13 patients had at least 1 SLN with metastasis. Among these 13
   patients with SLN metastasis, ICG and Tc-99m had detected the SLN among
   12 patients, while 1 patient had been detected by ICG alone. Conclusions
   Our results show that ICG is as effective as the radioisotope for SLNB
   even among patients who have undergone NACT. This trial is registered
   with the German Clinical Trial Register, ID: DRKS00013606.}},

   coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (formerly known as HCoV-19) emerged in late
   2019 in Wuhan, China, and is now triggering a pandemic. COVID-19, TB,
   MERS and SARS - threats and opportunities progress against deadly
   infection make more people sick in the hospital. Therefore, we should be
   aware of the care and control of these diseases. Consequently, good air
   quality management is required to control and reduce possible infected
   air, such as carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration. In this research, a
   mathematical model for the risk analysis of airborne infectious disease
   in an outpatient room is proposed. Not only considering one type of
   person but also in this research, people are considered according to
   personal classifications. There are 4 types - patient, relative, worker,
   and outsider, staying in an outpatient room, which is in accordance with
   the real world. Air quality control manipulations are simulated using
   the inlet and outlet ventilation rates adjustment under the condition of
   a number of surrounding people with a personal classified factor. The
   fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) is used to approximate the model
   solution. The proposed numerical model can be used to describe the
   dynamical dispersion of airborne infectious disease in an outpatient
   room. The results of the model are satisfactory, and it will be able to
   control airborne disease in more complicated structures.}},

Abstract = {{A protein probe with an electron-transfer peptide and a His-tag was
   designed to electrochemically sense a target protein. We selected
   tyrosine-rich (Y4C) and tryptophan-rich (W4C) peptides for use as
   electron-transfer agents. The peak for oxidation was based on the
   oxidations of the phenolic hydroxy groups in Y4C and on the indole rings
   in W4C. Asialofetuin (ASF) with galactose residues was the protein
   probe, and a galactose recognition protein, soybean agglutinin (SBA),
   was the target protein. A protein probe composed of an amino acid and
   carbohydrate residue was expected to be biocompatible. When voltammetric
   measurements were performed using a glassy carbon electrode, the
   oxidation peaks of H6Y4C and ASF-H6Y4C appeared at the same potential.
   The peak current of ASF-H6Y4C was 4-fold that of H6Y4C because of the
   stronger adsorption of ASF-H6Y4C onto the electrode. The electrode
   response of ASF-H6Y4C with SBA was half that of ASF-H6Y4C alone. By
   contrast, the peak current of ASF-Y4CH6 was higher than that of
   ASF-H6Y4C, which was the result of a greater degree of contact between
   the Y4C moieties and an electrode. On the other hand, the voltammetric
   behaviors of ASF with W4C and a His-tag were similar to those with Y4C
   and a His-tag. The sensitivity of SBA using ASF-Y4CH6 was at the 10(-13)
   M level. To confirm the function of the sensing system, measurements
   were performed in human serum with SBA and ASF-Y4CH6. When SBA was
   added, the serum had a concentration that ranged between 5.0x10(-13) and
   4.0x10(-12) M, and the amount of SBA that could be recovered ranged from
   97 to 101\%. Consequently, this system could be applied to the detection
   of SBA in serum.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NUTRITION AND METABOLISM}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Purpose. Dietary habit and body composition can develop risk of
   menstrual disorders. The objective of this study was to assess the
   relationship between macronutrient intake, anthropometric indices, and
   menstrual disorders. Methods. This cross-sectional study was conducted
   on 217 women with an average age of 28.8 +/- 7.9 years. Anthropometric
   indices including body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC),
   waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and skinfold thickness from all participants
   were measured. Menstrual cycle characteristics were self-reported. The
   dietary habits were assessed by using a modified, semiquantitative 147
   items Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) by two trained dietitians.
   Chi-square and independent T-test were used to assess bivariate
   associations and logistic regression was implemented in SPSS 21.
   Results. Most of the participants (52.5\%) suffered from at least one of
   the menstrual disorders including painful menstruation (41\%),
   premenstrual syndrome (PMS) (24.9\%), and irregular menstruation
   (22.1\%). The mean of waist circumference in women with no complication
   was 76.0 +/- 11.8 and in women with at least one disorder was 86.7 +/-
   14.0 (P<0.001). Our results suggest that women with no disorder consumed
   less calorie, carbohydrate, protein, and fat in comparison to women with
   at least one disorder (P<0.001). Furthermore, the proportion of all
   kinds of disorders among women, who had overweight or obesity, was
   significantly higher than women with normal BMI (P<0.001). Conclusion.
   Irregular menstruation, painful menstruation, and PMS were significantly
   associated with high intake of calories, proteins, carbohydrates, and
   total fat. Furthermore, menstruation-related complications were worsened
   by obesity.}},

Abstract = {{The modelling of each horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT) differs due to
   variation in operating conditions, dynamic parameters, and components.
   Thus, the choice of profiles also varies for specific applications. So
   for the better choice of profiles, the wind turbine performance is
   analysed for different parameters and working conditions. The efficiency
   of HAWTs mainly depends on the blade, which in turn is related to the
   profile of the blade, blade orientation, and tip size. Hence, the main
   aim of the present work is to evaluate the performance of HAWTs for
   three different blade tip sizes and six different blade twist angles for
   three major NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics) airfoils.
   A statistical analysis is also carried out to find the influence of
   different performance parameters such as drag, lift, voracity, and
   normal force. The static design parameters are considered based on the
   available literature. A three-bladed offshore HAWT is adopted as the
   research object in the study. Data visualization using star glyphs and
   sunray plots is performed, along with multilinear regression analysis.
   From the multilinear regression analysis and reliable empirical
   correlations, it is known that drag coefficient and lift coefficient
   parameters have less significance in contrast to the other parameters
   which have more significance in the regression model. The different
   results obtained in terms of parametric coefficients provide an
   effective way to generate appropriate airfoil profiles for given HAWTs.
   Thus, the study helps to achieve better turbine performance, and it
   serves as a benchmark for future studies on HAWTs.}},

Abstract = {{Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm broadens to several research fields.
   Thus, Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) has been adopted as a standard
   to create an IoT scheme implemented on healthcare system. Furthermore,
   IoT can be employed to measure several diseases including stroke,
   diabetes, as well as respiratory diseases to monitor patient condition
   and environment change that might be harmful for patients.
   Implementation and realization of IoT for monitoring respiratory
   diseases is needed since in Taiwan the risk to get more severe symptoms
   by those diseases is relatively high considering the air pollution that
   is getting higher. In this study, IoT system is built based on the
   integration of several independent applications. In addition, our scheme
   consists of four main components such as environment sensing box,
   patient monitoring tools, android apps, and web Graphical User Interface
   (GUI). Web GUI is useful for health practitioners such as doctors and
   nurses to monitor the condition of patients obtained by patient
   monitoring tools. Moreover, patients and doctors can assess the status
   of weather and environmental condition whether it is safe or harmful for
   patients. Finally, android based apps is necessary for patients to
   connect all of schemes as well as monitoring all conditions including
   health and environmental status. The assessment of our tools indicates
   that the implemented scheme is consistent enough shown by low Root Mean
   Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE) achieved by
   our IoT system.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, the authors employ work on events, framing, and social
   problems to develop an inductive approach to studying events. The
   article's central premise is that tracing direct references made to
   events offers a fruitful strategy to investigate their framing
   cross-nationally and over time. The authors apply their approach to the
   case of 9/11 in American, French, and Dutch national newspapers
   (2001-2015). By combining word counting, topic modeling, and content
   analysis they examine the amount of attention given to 9/11, the issues
   to which it has been linked, and the implications attributed to it. The
   results indicate that the framing of 9/11 in the above three countries
   has been stable and uniform regarding foreign issues. There are however
   enduring, marked cross-national differences with respect to domestic
   issues. In France, 9/11 has barely been related to such issues; in the
   United States, the event has been connected principally to national
   security; and in the Netherlands, it has mainly prompted the
   problematization of Muslim immigrants. Because 9/11 has been a
   significant event many years after its occurrence, albeit differently so
   in each country of study, the findings point to the relevance of
   studying the framing of events cross-nationally and over extended
   periods of time.}},

Title = {{Near-infrared reflectance imaging of neovascularization in proliferative
   diabetic retinopathy}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RETINA AND VITREOUS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundBlood is one of the main absorbers in the near-infrared
   spectrum and thus retinal vessels appear dark in near-infrared
   reflectance (NIR) images. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is
   characterized by abnormal neovascularization which also absorbs light
   and appears dark against a lighter fundus background. We analyzed
   neovascularization in PDR using NIR imaging, by observing changes in the
   neovascular complexes (NVCs) contrast and reflectivity over
   time.MethodsRetrospective case series of 20 eyes of 17 patients with PDR
   who underwent NIR imaging with optical coherence tomography (OCT) using
   the Spectralis System. NVCs presence and activity was determined using
   clinical, tomographic and angiographic criteria. At baseline, all NVCs
   were qualitatively graded in the NIR image into 3 groups (absent,
   present and inactive and present and active) and their evolution over
   time was registered as progression, regression or same
   status.ResultsTwenty-seven NVCs were imaged, of which, 52\% were
   neovascularization of the disc (NVD) and 48\% were elsewhere (NVE).
   Consecutive NIR images were obtained from baseline to up to 5
   time-points with a mean follow-up of 3.21.7 years. All eyes underwent
   laser treatment and 30\% had additional intravitreal therapy. Using NIR
   imaging, NVCs were classified at baseline as absent, present and
   inactive and present and active, respectively in 11, 4 and 85\% of
   cases. NIR identified active neovascularization as hyporeflective
   irregular dark vessels originating from the retinal venules in NVE or
   from the disc in NVD. In all groups during follow-up, progression was
   identified as the development of new vascular hyporeflective dark fronds
   while regression was shown by reduced dark perfusion. Five eyes
   developed a wolf's jaw configuration with vascular hyporeflective new
   vessels and hyperreflective tissue from extensive fibrosis. Fibrosis was
   more apparent in later images, reaching 86\%. In 3 cases (11\%), the NVC
   was no longer seen in NIR, although was still identifiable on OCT over
   the NVC area.ConclusionsNIR is a non-invasive imaging modality commonly
   performed alongside OCT and frequently overlooked which can be useful to
   evaluate NVCs in PDR. Changes in NVC contrast and reflectivity due to
   blood perfusion can help in the detection and monitoring of diabetic
   proliferative disease and aid clinicians in daily practice.}},

Title = {{COVID-19 lockdowns and a response model to health, economic and food
   anxiety}},
Journal = {{CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Pandemics create survival uncertainty through infection possibilities,
   food scarcity, and unemployment. Being the largest democracy in the
   world, we have explored the response of Indian citizens on the
   COVID-19's lockdown and defined an anxiety response model using PLS
   based Structural Equation Modeling(SEM). For a comprehensive
   understanding, we have measured the response at two levels of individual
   and government. Though the types of anxieties are related, we observed
   that a specific response is linked with a specific type of anxiety and
   all responses are not anxiety-driven. We have found that the response
   mechanism of Health and Food anxieties follow very different paths and
   that the role of information is not significant in all anxieties. Our
   results will help policymakers in understanding how to respond to a
   crisis and optimize policy implementation accordingly. It will further
   help the scholars understand the difference in the anxieties caused by
   the pandemic and the layers of responses individuals take in such
   situations.}},

Abstract = {{Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) kappa free light chain (KFLC) index has been
   described as a reliable marker of intrathecal IgG synthesis to diagnose
   multiple sclerosis (MS). Our aims were: (1) to compare the efficiency of
   KFLC through different interpretation approaches in diagnosing MS. (2)
   to evaluate the prognostic value of KFLC in radiologically and
   clinically isolated syndromes (RIS-CIS). We enrolled 133 MS patients and
   240 with other neurological diseases (93 inflammatory including 18
   RIS-CIS, 147 non-inflammatory). Albumin, lambda free light chain (LFLC)
   and KFLC were measured in the CSF and serum by nephelometry. We included
   two groups of markers: (a) corrected for blood-CSF barrier permeability:
   immunoglobulin G (IgG), KFLC and LFLC indexes. (b) CSF ratios (not
   including albumin and serum-correction): CSF KFLC/LFLC, CSF KFLC/IgG,
   CSF LFLC/IgG. KFLC were significantly higher in MS patients compared to
   those with other diseases (both inflammatory or not). KFLC index and CSF
   KFLC/IgG ratio showed high sensitivity (93\% and 86.5\%) and moderate
   specificity (85\% and 88\%) in diagnosing MS. RIS-CIS patients who
   converted to MS showed greater KFLC index and CSF KFLC/IgG. Despite OB
   are confirmed to be the gold-standard to detect intrathecal IgG
   synthesis, the KFLC confirmed their accuracy in MS diagnosis. A
   ``kappa-oriented{''} response characterizes MS and has a prognostic
   impact in the RIS-CIS population.}},

Journal = {{PLANT ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Background and aims - Rubieae is a tribe in the subfamily Rubioideae
   characterised by herbaceous plants with verticillate leaves and flowers
   with a rudimentary or absent calyx and a short, cup-shaped corolla. This
   is in contrast to the flowers of most other Rubiaceae, in which the
   tubular corolla is longer than the corolla lobes. Also, the description
   by Payer, a French 19th century pioneer of floral ontogenetic research,
   of the floral development in Asperula, Galium, and Rubia deviates from
   recent insights about the development of tubular corollas, which are
   based on investigations of flowers of tropical Rubiaceae. Tubular
   corollas are currently considered as resulting from the development of
   underlying annular intercalary meristems, whereas Payer explained the
   tubular corollas in the three taxa by postgenital fusion. We therefore
   tested both hypotheses in six Rubieae genera, including the three taxa
   studied by Payer.
   Methods - Floral ontogeny of ten species in six Rubieae genera based on
   scanning electron (SEM) and light microscopy (LM).
   Conclusions - Our results suggest that, in all species studied, the
   mature phenotype of the corolla as well as the epipetaly of the stamens
   is caused by a combination of three developmental processes (the
   development of a stamen-corolla tube, the development of a corolla tube
   sensu stricto, and postgenital fusion), and the relative moment of
   activation of each of these processes during floral development
   (plastochron variation or heterochrony).}},

Abstract = {{This study aimed to explore the psychological situation and the
   influence of the outbreak of COVID-19 on college students. An online
   questionnaire survey was conducted among 3,092 Chinese college students
   who were quarantined at home as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The
   survey tools included the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale
   (GAD-7), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), and the Self-Rating Scale
   of Sleep (SRSS). Of all the respondents, the prevalence of anxiety
   symptoms, sleep problems, any of the two, and both of the two, were
   16.8, 13.5, 25.1, and 5.3\%, respectively. Of the participants, 43.7\%
   of the college students had higher perceived stress. Factors associated
   with anxiety symptoms included reading the daily news with higher
   frequency (1-3 times; 4-7 times; more than 7 times), having sleep
   problems, higher stress, and carelessness with the number of remaining
   masks. Factors associated with sleep problems included postgraduates,
   reading the news with higher frequency daily (1-3 times), the frequency
   of going out per week (1-3 times), having anxiety symptoms and higher
   stress. Factors associated with higher perceived stress included reading
   the daily news with higher frequency (4-7 times), anxiety about the
   number of remaining masks (1-10; more than 20), having anxiety symptoms,
   and having sleep problems. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms, sleep
   problems, and higher perceived stress among college students was high
   during the COVID-19 outbreak. Particular attention should be paid to
   psychological support for college students quarantined at home,
   especially those at high risk of psychological problems.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: A prospective investigation of serum thymidine kinase 1
   concentration (STK1p) was performed to evaluate its prognostic value in
   patients with non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLCs). Patients \&
   methods: The STK1p values of 127 patients were determined by an enhanced
   chemiluminescent dot blot assay. The patients were recruited from March
   2011 to December 2017. Results: Kaplan-Meier plot showed that patients
   with elevated STK1p values had worse overall survival (OS), especially
   patients of early/middle stages. Multi-variable COX regression showed
   that STK1p value and combined treatment surgery + chemotherapy were
   independent prognostic factors for favorable OS. Conclusion: STK1p is
   helpful in predicting OS of early/middle stages (I-IIIA) NSCLCs patients
   following a nonrandomized individual adapted treatment, but is may be
   not recommended in advanced stages (IIIB + IV) of NSCLCs.

Abstract = {{Mode division multiplexing has attracted great attention because it can
   potentially overcome the limitation of single-mode fiber traffic
   capacity. However, it has been challenging to realize multiple modes
   controlling and switching due to the intrinsic overlap of the modes in
   the transmission waveguide. As a solution, we propose a cascaded
   phase-shifted long-period fiber grating (PS-LPFG) based multiple mode
   switching scheme. Using the PS-LPFGs, the multiple guided orbital
   angular momentum (OAM) modes selective controlling and switching at
   multi-wavelength can be achieved in few-mode fibers by regulating the
   grating resonance condition. In principle, a N x N mode switch matrix
   can be realized by cascading C-N(2) gratings, where each grating acts as
   a mode switch element to achieve a couple selected OAM mode switching
   and meanwhile the other modes are under nonblocking status. As a proof
   of the concept, a 2 x 2 mode switching between two OAM modes at
   different wavelengths based on one PS-LPFG element is demonstrated in
   our experiments. The switching efficiency of the two modes at two
   wavelengths 1537nm and 1558nm are similar to 98.4\% and similar to
   98.7\%, respectively. The proposed multiple OAM mode switch has
   potential applications in the future hybrid multi-dimensional
   multiplexing optical fiber communication systems. (C) 2020 Optical

Abstract = {{Aim The enemy release hypothesis (ERH) posits that exotic species suffer
   less enemy damage than natives, which promotes their successful
   invasion. However, the generality of less damage for exotics remains
   widely debated. A recent view proposes that enemy release (ER) could
   change systematically with latitude, potentially helping to explain
   these inconsistencies. Here, we test whether exotic plant species suffer
   consistently lower herbivore damage relative to natives and whether ER
   varies with latitude.
   Location Global.
   Time period 1960-2018.
   Major taxa studied Plants.
   Methods Using leaf herbivory data for 1,098 plant species, we compared
   the herbivory rate between exotic and native plants across all taxa,
   between the introduced and native range of exotic species and between
   exotic and native species co-occurring in the same community. We tested
   the interaction effect between origin (exotic versus native) and
   latitude to assess variation in ER with latitude. We also examined
   whether the effect of origin and its interaction with latitude changed
   with plant growth form (woody versus non-woody). Finally, based on two
   ER effect-size datasets, two meta-regressions were performed to
   demonstrate the relationship between ER and latitude.
   Results Leaf herbivory rates were commonly lower for exotics than for
   natives. However, this differential herbivory rate was significant only
   for woody plants. No significant interactions were found between origin
   and latitude, indicating that ER did not change with latitude. The
   meta-regressions also demonstrated that ER was not significantly
   correlated with latitude.
   Main conclusions The widespread lower herbivory rate for exotic compared
   with native woody plant species supports the ERH for exotic woody
   plants. Consistent ER with latitude indicates that ER should play a
   similar role regardless of latitude. One future challenge is to assess
   the extent to which ER in woody exotic plants translates to performance
   advantages and thereby influences their invasion success.}},

Abstract = {{Two vanillin-based photocurable, thermally reprocessable, and chemically
   recyclable imine thermosets were successfully designed. The vanillin
   vitrimer resins were synthesized through a protocol with a two-step
   reaction: methacrylation and imination with diamine or triamine. The
   obtained vinyl ester resins with imine bonds and vinyl groups could be
   photocured into thermosets in 10 min at room temperature. The cured
   thermosets had good solvent resistance against common solvents, good
   thermal stability up to about 250 degrees C as measured by
   thermogravimetry, and high storage modulus (1.6-3.4 GPa as determined by
   dynamic mechanical analysis). Owing to the reversibility of the imine
   bond, both thermosets exhibited typical vitrimer behavior including
   stress relaxation and thermal reprocessability, while their activation
   energy for the imine exchange reaction and recovery ratio of tensile
   stress after reprocessing varied due to different cross-linking
   densities. Furthermore, both thermosets could be chemically recycled in
   hexylamine through an imine exchange reaction. The presented new
   strategy, thus, paves the way for production of fast-curing, chemically
   and thermally stable, but still thermally reprocessable and chemically
   recyclable imine vitrimers from abundant biobased building blocks.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new reliability method for load-sharing parallel
   systems with dependent components that share the workload equally before
   and after some components have failed is studied. In the working process
   of a load-sharing parallel system, after the failure of some components,
   the surviving components share the original system workload with higher
   components loads. The states of all the components are dependent. The
   failure behavior of a component impacts the strength degradation process
   of the remaining working components. For a load-sharing parallel system,
   one component works the whole system works, which means the component
   with the largest initial strength works, the whole system works.
   Firstly, we use the equivalent strength degradation theory to get the
   remaining strength of the component with the largest initial strength
   after some components fail. Then, the stress-strength interference model
   will be used to calculate the reliability after some components fail.
   Finally, the proposed method is illustrated by a numerical example and
   verified by the Monte Carlo simulation method.}},

Title = {{Dynamic Transitions in Neuronal Network Firing Sustained by Abnormal
   Astrocyte Feedback}},
Journal = {{NEURAL PLASTICITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Astrocytes play a crucial role in neuronal firing activity. Their
   abnormal state may lead to the pathological transition of neuronal
   firing patterns and even induce seizures. However, there is still little
   evidence explaining how the astrocyte network modulates seizures caused
   by structural abnormalities, such as gliosis. To explore the role of
   gliosis of the astrocyte network in epileptic seizures, we first
   established a direct astrocyte feedback neuronal network model on the
   basis of the hippocampal CA3 neuron-astrocyte model to simulate the
   condition of gliosis when astrocyte processes swell and the feedback to
   neurons increases in an abnormal state. We analyzed the firing pattern
   transitions of the neuronal network when astrocyte feedback starts to
   change via increases in both astrocyte feedback intensity and the
   connection probability of astrocytes to neurons in the network. The
   results show that as the connection probability and astrocyte feedback
   intensity increase, neuronal firing transforms from a nonepileptic
   synchronous firing state to an asynchronous firing state, and when
   astrocyte feedback starts to become abnormal, seizure-like firing
   becomes more severe and synchronized; meanwhile, the synchronization
   area continues to expand and eventually transforms into long-term
   seizure-like synchronous firing. Therefore, our results prove that
   astrocyte feedback can regulate the firing of the neuronal network, and
   when the astrocyte network develops gliosis, there will be an increase
   in the induction rate of epileptic seizures.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we numerically demonstrate a new facile strategy for
   all-dielectric broadband optical perfect absorbers. A monolayer
   refractory titanium oxide and nitride (TiN/TiO2) core-shell nanowires
   array is used to form the grating on the opaque TiN substrate. Multiple
   resonant absorption bands are observed in the adjacent wavelength range,
   which therefore leads to the formation of an ultra-broadband absorption
   window from the visible to the infrared regime. The maximal absorption
   reaches 95.6\% and the average absorption efficiency in the whole range
   (0.5-1.8 mu m) is up to 85.4\%. Moreover, the absorption bandwidth can
   be feasibly adjusted while the absorption efficiency can be still
   maintained in a high level via tuning the polarization state.
   Furthermore, the absorption window is observed to be highly adjustable
   in the wavelength range, showing a nearly linear relationship to the
   shell's index. These features not only confirm the achievement of the
   broadband perfect absorption but also introduce feasible ways to
   artificially manipulate the absorption properties, which will hold wide
   applications in metal-free plasmonic optoelectronic devices such as the
   solar harvesting, photo-detection, and thermal generation and its
   related bio-medical techniques. (C) 2020 Optical Society of America

Title = {{Next generation sequencing of RB1gene for the molecular diagnosis of
   ethnic minority with retinoblastoma in Yunnan}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL GENETICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Retinoblastoma is a rare intraocular malignancy and
   typically initiated by inactivating biallelic mutations of RB1 gene.
   Each year, similar to 8000 children worldwide are diagnosed for
   retinoblastoma. In high-income countries, patient survival is over 95\%
   while low-income countries is similar to 30\%.If disease is diagnosed
   early and treated in centers specializing in retinoblastoma, the
   survival might exceed 95\% and many eyes could be safely treated and
   support a lifetime of good vision. In China, approximate 1100 newly
   diagnosed cases are expected annually and 28 hospitals covering 25
   provinces established centers classified by expertise and resources for
   better treatment options and follow-up. Comparing with other province of
   eastern China, Yunnan province is remote geographically. This might
   result that healthcare staff have low awareness of the role of genetic
   testing in management and screening in families.
   Methods: The patients with retinoblastoma were selected in Yunnan. DNA
   from blood was used for targeted gene sequencing. Then, an in-house
   bioinformatics pipeline was done to detect both single nucleotide
   variants and small insertions/deletions. The pathogenic mutations were
   identified and further confirmed by conventional methods and
   cosegregation in families.
   Results: Using our approach, targeted next generation sequencing was
   used to detect the mutation of these 12 probands. Bioinformatic
   predictions showed that nine mutations were found in our study and four
   were novel pathogenic variants in these nine mutations.
   Conclusions: It's the first report to describe RB1 mutations in Yunnan
   children with retinoblastoma. This study would improve role of genetic
   testing for management and family screening.}},

   interruptions}},
Journal = {{PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{58}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{How can we retrieve action plans in working memory (WM) after being
   distracted or interrupted? The present EEG study investigated this
   question using a WM task in which a random sequence of single numbers
   (1-4 and 6-9) was presented. In a given trial, participants had to
   decide whether the number presented in the preceding trial was odd or
   even. Additionally, interfering stimuli were randomly presented in 25\%
   of all trials, requiring the participants to either ignore a colored
   number (distraction) or respond to it (interruption) while maintaining
   the previously formed action plan in WM. Our results revealed a
   detrimental impact of interruptions on WM performance in trials after
   interrupting stimuli compared to trials without a preceding
   interference. This was reflected in decreased task accuracy and reduced
   stimulus- and response-locked P3b amplitudes potentially indicating a
   hampered reactivation of stimulus-response links. Moreover, decreased
   contralateral mu suppression prior to a given response highlighted an
   impaired response preparation following interruptions. Distractions, on
   the other hand, did not negatively affect task performance but were
   followed by faster responses in subsequent trials compared to trials
   without prior interference. This result pattern was supported by
   stronger contralateral mu suppression indicating a facilitated response
   preparation. Overall, these results suggest that action representations
   in WM are resistant to distractions but do suffer from interruptions
   that disrupt or interfere with their implementation. We thus propose
   that the possibility of adequately preparing for an upcoming response is
   essential for behavioral guidance in the presence of external
   interference.}},

Abstract = {{Streamflow forecasting is a crucial component in the management and
   control of water resources. Decomposition-based approaches have
   particularly demonstrated improved forecasting performance. However,
   direct decomposition of entire streamflow data with calibration and
   validation subsets is not practical for signal component prediction.
   This impracticality is due to the fact that the calibration process uses
   some validation information that is not available in practical
   streamflow forecasting. Unfortunately, independent decomposition of
   calibration and validation sets leads to undesirable boundary effects
   and less accurate forecasting. To alleviate such boundary effects and
   improve the forecasting performance in basins lacking meteorological
   observations, we propose a two-stage decomposition prediction (TSDP)
   framework. We realize this framework using variational mode
   decomposition (VMD) and support vector regression (SVR) and refer to
   this realization as VMD-SVR. We demonstrate experimentally the
   effectiveness, efficiency and accuracy of the TSDP framework and its
   VMD-SVR realization in terms of the boundary effect reduction,
   computational cost, and overfitting, in addition to decomposition and
   forecasting outcomes for different lead times. Specifically, four
   comparative experiments were conducted based on the ensemble empirical
   mode decomposition (EEMD), singular spectrum analysis (SSA), discrete
   wavelet transform (DWT), boundary-corrected maximal overlap discrete
   wavelet transform (BCMODWT), autoregressive integrated moving average
   (ARIMA), SVR, backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and long short-term
   memory (LSTM). The TSDP framework was also compared with the wavelet
   data-driven forecasting framework (WDDFF). Results of experiments on
   monthly runoff data collected from three stations at the Wei River show
   the superiority of the VMD-SVR model compared to benchmark models.}},

   feasibility and diagnostic performance in comparison to CO2-angiography
   in patients with peripheral arterial disease}},
Journal = {{ACTA RADIOLOGICA}},
Abstract = {{Background Patients with substantially impaired kidney function and
   peripheral arterial disease (PAD) underwent comparative CO2-based
   depiction of the pelvic arteries (PAs). Purpose To evaluate the
   feasibility and diagnostic performance of CO2-based C-arm computed
   tomography (CACT) and compare its depiction of PAs with CO2-digital
   subtraction angiography (DSA). Material and Methods Fifteen patients (10
   men, mean age 70 +/- 11 years) with PAD received CO2-DSA and CO2-CACT of
   the PAs, depicted from the aorta to femoral arteries. These were divided
   into nine segments (135 in total) and graded by two independent readers
   for image quality (IQ; 1 = sufficient, 2 = minimal impairments, 3 =
   insufficient, 4 = outside field of view) and subsequent stenosis grading
   (SG; grade 1: normal to grade 4: occlusion), under exclusion of all
   segments with insufficient IQ. Inter-observer and inter-modality
   agreement calculation and subsequent consensus reading were performed
   and correlated to a standard of reference (StOR), representing a
   modality consensus. Results Of 135 segments, 117 showed sufficient IQ,
   excluding 18 segments (10 CACT, 8 DSA). Inter-observer agreement for IQ
   and consecutive SG demonstrated good to excellent agreement: IQ(DSA):
   kappa = 0.83, IQ(CACT): kappa = 0.76; Stenosis(DSA): kappa = 0.71,
   Stenosis(CACT): kappa = 0.84. Inter-modality agreement for SG lay at
   kappa = 0.76 and kappa = 0.65, respectively. More stenoses could be
   detected by CACT, and analysis of pooled consensus values of SG in
   CACT(cons) versus StOR showed an excellent agreement (kappa = 0.96) that
   proved considerably higher than the moderate agreement between consensus
   values in DSA(cons) versus StOR (kappa = 0.43). Conclusion CO2-CACT
   proved feasible, and has the potential to optimize angiographic work-up
   of PAD in patients with contraindications for other contrast media.}},

Title = {{G6PD overexpression protects from oxidative stress and age-related
   hearing loss}},
Journal = {{AGING CELL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Aging of the auditory system is associated with the incremental
   production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the accumulation of
   oxidative damage in macromolecules, which contributes to cellular
   malfunction, compromises cell viability, and, ultimately, leads to
   functional decline. Cellular detoxification relies in part on the
   production of NADPH, which is an important cofactor for major cellular
   antioxidant systems. NADPH is produced principally by the housekeeping
   enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), which catalyzes the
   rate-limiting step in the pentose phosphate pathway. We show here that
   G6PD transgenic mice (G6PD-Tg), which show enhanced constitutive G6PD
   activity and NADPH production along life, have lower auditory thresholds
   than wild-type mice during aging, together with preserved inner hair
   cell (IHC) and outer hair cell (OHC), OHC innervation, and a conserved
   number of synapses per IHC. Gene expression of antioxidant enzymes was
   higher in 3-month-old G6PD-Tg mice than in wild-type counterparts,
   whereas the levels of pro-apoptotic proteins were lower. Consequently,
   nitration of proteins, mitochondrial damage, and TUNEL+ apoptotic cells
   were all lower in 9-month-old G6PD-Tg than in wild-type counterparts.
   Unexpectedly, G6PD overexpression triggered low-grade inflammation that
   was effectively resolved in young mice, as shown by the absence of
   cochlear cellular damage and macrophage infiltration. Our results lead
   us to propose that NADPH overproduction from an early stage is an
   efficient mechanism to maintain the balance between the production of
   ROS and cellular detoxification power along aging and thus prevents
   hearing loss progression.}},

Abstract = {{We present a macroeconomic analysis of loan sales driven by bank
   competition in lending and entrepreneur directed search for funding
   opportunities. We show how these two features of our macrofinance model
   can interact to reduce interest rates on loans financed via
   on-balance-sheet activities, and how this can motivate loan sales as a
   strategy of financing via off-balance-sheet activities. The results shed
   some light on the shift over the years preceding the global financial
   crisis in the practice of U.S. and European banks, from the traditional
   ``originate-to-hold{''} model of credit provision, toward the
   ``originate-to-distribute{''} approach for credit extension. (JEL E44,

Abstract = {{The smart electrical grid (SEG), that utilizes information for creating
   a widely distributed automated energy delivery network, is considered as
   an advanced digital 2-way power flow power system. Under different
   uncertainties, SEG is capable of self-healing, adaptive, resilient, and
   sustainable with foresight for prediction. Hence, SEG is considered as
   the next generation power grid. In this paper, a comprehensive survey on
   SEG as a new technology and operating models which will affect
   performance of distribution networks in the future are explored in
   detail. Most of the basic concepts affect such new technology like
   (Internet of Things (IoT), fog, cloud computing, and big data analysis)
   are discussed. A brief overview of IoT technologies is provided. It will
   explore the architectural structure of a typical IoT, cloud computing
   system, and different levels of the system. Furthermore, many
   classification methods and then electrical load forecasting (ELF)
   strategy that includes the preprocessing phase and the prediction phase
   have been discussed. Additionally, the different techniques used to
   manage big data generated by sensors and meters for application
   processing are explored. Feature selection and outlier rejection are
   discussed as a preprocessing process to filter the data, and then the
   load prediction process is explained. Finally, this paper covers the
   analysis of the load prediction phase in ELF strategy in which the
   prediction techniques will be reviewed.}},

Abstract = {{Association of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors with risk of death in
   patients with hypertension (HTN) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
   is not well characterized. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
   outcomes of patients with HTN and COVID-19 with respect to different
   chronic antihypertensive drug intake. We performed a retrospective,
   observational study from a large cohort of patients with HTN and with a
   laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
   infection admitted to the Emergency Rooms (ER) of the Piacenza Hospital
   network from February 21, 2020 to March 20, 2020. There were 1050
   patients admitted to the ERs of the Piacenza Hospital network with
   COVID-19. HTN was present in 590 patients {[}median age, 76.2 years (IQR
   68.2-82.6)]; 399 (66.1\%) patients were male. Of them, 248 patients were
   chronically treated with ACEi, 181 with ARBs, and 161 with other drugs
   (O-drugs) including beta blockers, diuretics and calcium-channel
   inhibitors. With respect to the antihypertensive use, there was no
   difference between comorbid conditions. During a follow-up of 38 days
   (IQR 7.0-46.0), 256 patients (43.4\%) died, without any difference
   stratifying for antihypertensive drugs. Of them, 107 (43.1\%) were in
   ACEi group vs 67 (37\%) in ARBs group vs 82 (50.7\%) in O-drugs group,
   (log-rank test: p = 0.066). In patients with HTN and COVID-19, neither
   ACEi nor ARBs were independently associated with mortality. After
   adjusting for potential confounders in risk prediction, the rate of
   death was similar. Our data confirm Specialty Societal recommendations,
   suggesting that treatment with ACEIs or ARBs should not be discontinued
   because of COVID-19.}},

Abstract = {{Learning from nature, molecular self-assembly has been used extensively
   to generate interesting materials using a bottom up approach. The
   enthusiasm in this field of research stems from the unique properties of
   these materials and their diverse applications. The field has not been
   limited to studying assembly of similar types of molecules but extended
   to multi component systems via the co-assembly phenomenon. We have
   designed two charge complementary peptides to study their co-assembly in
   mechanistic detail in the present work. The cooperative self-assembly is
   mainly driven by electrostatic interaction that is aided by aromatic
   interactions, hydrogen bonding interactions and hydrophobic
   interactions. The hydrogels obtained have been employed in waste water
   remediation. Both the self-assembled and co-assembled hydrogels are
   capable of removal of different kinds of organic dyes (cationic, anionic
   and neutral) and toxic metal ions (Ni2+, Co2+, Pb2+ and Hg2+)
   individually and as a mixture from water with high efficiency.
   Additionally, the peptides developed in this study can act as ion
   sensors and detect arsenic in its most toxic (III/V) oxidation states.
   Molecular understanding of the assembly process is of fundamental
   importance in the rational design of such simple, robust yet
   economically viable materials with versatile and novel applications.}},

Abstract = {{Safety is considered an important aspect of life and well-being.
   However, few studies have examined the relationship between safety and
   well-being among children, especially in Latin American. This study aims
   at analyzing the relationship between perceptions of safety and
   children's subjective well-being, considering children's school, city
   context, and sex. Participants were 2,200 Brazilian children (10-13
   years old) who answered the single item on Overall Life Satisfaction,
   the Satisfaction With Life Student Scale, and four items regarding
   safety perceptions. Through analysis of variance and structural equation
   modeling (SEM), results indicate that children who live in inner cities
   and study in private schools have significantly higher averages of
   safety perception. Also, boys present higher averages about how safe
   they feel. SEM presents a positive and significant relationship between
   safety perception and children's subjective well-being and multigroup
   SEM indicates invariance of the model across groups. Safety is presented
   as an important component of well-being. Interventions aimed at
   promoting safety and community ties can enhance children's well-being.}},

Abstract = {{Autolysin is a lytic enzyme that hydrolyzes peptidoglycans of the
   bacterial cell wall, with a catalytic domain and cell wall-binding (CWB)
   domains, to be involved in different physiological functions that
   require bacterial cell wall remodeling. We identified a novel autolysin,
   Acd24020, from Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile (C. difficile),
   with an endopeptidase catalytic domain belonging to the NlpC/P60 family
   and three bacterial Src-homology 3 domains as CWB domains. The catalytic
   domain of Acd24020 (Acd24020-CD) exhibited C. difficile-specific lytic
   activity equivalent to Acd24020, indicating that Acd24020-CD has
   full-function as a lytic enzyme by itself. To elucidate the specific
   peptidoglycan-recognition and catalytic reaction mechanisms of
   Acd24020-CD, biochemical characterization, X-ray structure
   determination, a modeling study of the enzyme/substrate complex, and
   mutagenesis analysis were performed. Acd24020-CD has an hourglass-shaped
   substrate-binding groove across the molecule, which is responsible for
   recognizing the direct 3-4 cross-linking structure unique to C.
   difficile peptidoglycan. Based on the X-ray structure and modeling
   study, we propose a dynamic Cys/His catalyzing mechanism, in which the
   catalytic Cys299 and His354 residues dynamically change their
   conformations to complement each step of the enzyme catalytic reaction.}},

Abstract = {{Non-coding RNAs are closely associated with tumorigenesis in multiple
   malignant tumours, including osteosarcoma (OS). Long non-coding RNA
   Ewing sarcoma-associated transcript 1 (EWSAT1) plays a role in
   metastasis, and actin cytoskeletal changes in OS remain unclear. In the
   current study, we showed that EWSAT1 expression was up-regulated in OS
   and that an elevation in the EWSAT1 expression level was correlated with
   poor prognosis in patients with OS. Functionally, we showed that
   knockdown of EWSAT1 suppressed migration and induced actin stress fibre
   degradation in MNNG/HOS and 143B cells. Moreover, we found that ROCK1
   was a key downstream effector in EWSAT1-mediated cell migration and
   actin stress fibre changes. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ROCK1 and
   EWSAT1 shared a similar microRNA response element of microRNA-24-3p
   (miR-24-3p). Moreover, we verified that miR-24-3p suppressed ROCK1 and
   its mediated migration and actin stress fibres change by direct
   targeting. EWSAT1 promoted ROCK1-mediated migration and actin stress
   fibre formation through miR-24-3p sponging. Lastly, through an in vivo
   study, we demonstrated that EWSAT1 promoted lung metastasis in OS.
   According to the above-mentioned results, we suggest that EWSAT1 acts as
   an oncogene and that EWSAT1/miR-24-3p/ROCK1 axial could be a new target
   in the treatment of OS.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we set up a two-sided random search model to study the
   trading behaviour between buyers and sellers in the commercial real
   estate market. Our model shows that the interaction between search and
   bargaining has a profound influence on the role played by the market
   search friction regarding the equilibrium transaction price of
   commercial property and the well-being of both buyers and sellers.
   Against the traditional view that the existence of search friction
   always plays a negative role in the commercial real estate market, we
   find that under some conditions the market search friction can increase
   the equilibrium transaction price of commercial property and thus
   benefit sellers, which is considered the most valuable especially during
   the downturn of a business cycle.}},

Abstract = {{Developmental studies examining relations between word reading (WR) and
   decoding in typical and dyslexic populations routinely cut the reading
   distribution to form distinct groups. However, dichotomizing continuous
   variables to study development is problematic for multiple reasons.
   Instead, we modeled and visualized the parallel growth of WR and nonword
   reading (NWR) factor scores longitudinally in a Grade 1-4 developmental
   sample (N = 588). The results indicate that while WR and NWR growth
   factors are highly related (r = .71), the relation between WR and NWR
   trajectories change as a function of initial WR. Results are interpreted
   within computational models of dyslexia in which children with dyslexia
   overfit orthography -> phonology relations at the level of the word,
   limiting the development of sublexical representations needed to read
   nonwords.}},

Title = {{Quality of life, symptom severity and level of functioning in people
   with severe mental illness ready for hospital discharge}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC AND MENTAL HEALTH NURSING}},
Abstract = {{Accessible Summary
   What is known on the subject?
   The quality of life (QoL) of people with severe mental illness (SMI) is
   a growing international concern.
   Many earlier studies report the determinants and correlates of QoL and
   functioning in people with SMI in Western countries.
   The QoL and functioning of Asian inpatients with SMI are largely
   unknown, particularly at the point where they have been assessed as
   being ready for hospital discharge.
   What the paper adds to existing knowledge?
   Physical health, social functioning and community living skills, and
   negative symptoms are important areas of concern immediately
   pre-discharge.
   Social relationship related QoL, overall symptoms, unemployment,
   education level, living situation, physical illness and treatment
   duration predict functioning levels.
   What are the implications for practice?
   Mental health nurses should consider interventions beyond the
   traditional focus on psychopathology to improve functioning outcomes in
   people with SMI recently discharged from hospital.
   Inpatient services should utilise the opportunity to monitor and address
   physical health problems before discharge from inpatient care.
   There is a lack of evidence on quality of life (QoL) and functioning in
   Asian people with severe mental illness (SMI) immediately prior to
   hospital discharge. This information could have major implications for
   treatment.
   To profile perceived quality of life, symptom severity and level of
   functioning among people with SMI.
   A cross-sectional study involving 347 adult inpatients with SMI. QoL
   (WHO Quality of Life - Brief Form), symptom severity (Positive and
   Negative Syndrome Scale) and level of functioning (Specific Level of
   Functioning) were measured immediately pre-discharge.
   Participants reported low social relationship-related QOL. Weak
   correlations were found between functioning, QoL and symptoms.
   Regression analysis identified the social relationship QoL domain,
   employment status, education level, living situation, physical
   illnesses, overall symptoms and the duration of receiving psychiatric
   services were statistically significant predictors of functioning
   levels.
   The findings may highlight a need for interventions beyond the
   traditional emphasis on psychiatric symptoms in order to improve
   functioning following an inpatient admission.
   Interventions to improve functioning in recently discharged people with
   SMI may need to be specifically designed to improve patients' social
   relationships, support return to employment and minimise the risk of
   physical illness.

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of peribulbar anesthesia
   during strabismus surgery. Methods: Medical records of patients
   undergoing strabismus surgery and peribulbar anesthesia were reviewed.
   The overall efficacy of peribulbar anesthesia was evaluated as
   requirement of supplemental peribulbar anesthesia, impossibility to
   perform eye muscles surgery due to inadequate efficacy of the block and
   peribulbar block complications that occurred up to 6 weeks
   postoperatively. Presence of oculocardiac reflex (OCR) and presence of
   decreased visual acuity and afferent pupillary defect postoperatively
   were reported. Results: A total of 510 patients comprised our study
   group. The total amount of peribulbar injections was 717. Four patients
   (0.7\%) required supplemental injection in the superonasal quadrant.
   Five of 510 (0.9\%) required an anesthesiologic intervention with
   intravenous atropine. Eighty patients of 510 (15.6\%) complained about
   transitory complete ptosis and/or amaurosis postoperatively. No
   complications were observed up to 6 weeks postoperatively. Conclusion:
   Peribulbar anesthesia was an effective and safe option during strabismus

Abstract = {{Aquatic ecosystems are facing multiple direct and indirect stressors
   from anthropogenic activities. Aquatic colloids, including natural and
   manufactured nanoparticles, have received global concern owing to their
   ability to transport metals, nutrients and pollutants, and their
   potential to pose ecological risks for wildlife and human health.
   Asymmetric flow-field flow fractionation (AF4) has become one of the
   most promising and powerful approaches to characterize colloidal
   particles over the last ten years. This review overviews the advances
   and applications of AF4 for the study of aquatic systems over the last
   decade. The analytical challenge of AF4 and known deviation from
   theoretical assumptions are also critically dis-cussed, such as sample
   losses, membrane-analyte interactions, and overloading. Future needs for
   methodological advances are addressed. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Although interactions between plants and microbes at the plant-soil
   interface are known to be important for plant nutrient acquisition,
   relatively little is known about how root exudates contribute to
   nutrient exchange over the course of plant development. In this study,
   root exudates from slow- and fast-growing stages of Arabidopsis thaliana
   plants were collected, chemically analysed and then applied to a sandy
   nutrient-depleted soil. We then tracked the impacts of these exudates on
   soil bacterial communities, soil nutrients (ammonium, nitrate, available
   phosphorus and potassium) and plant growth. Both pools of exudates
   shifted bacterial community structure. GeoChip analyses revealed
   increases in the functional gene potential of both exudate-treated
   soils, with similar responses observed for slow-growing and fast-growing
   plant exudate treatments. The fast-growing stage root exudates induced
   higher nutrient mineralization and enhanced plant growth as compared to
   treatments with slow-growing stage exudates and the control. These
   results suggest that plants may adjust their exudation patterns over the
   course of their different growth phases to help tailor microbial
   recruitment to meet increased nutrient demands during periods demanding
   faster growth.}},

   of the accuracy of selected satellite-based precipitation products shows
   IMERG-F outperforms the others, and the performance of TMPA 3B42RT is

   performs the best in hourly streamflow simulation, as well as in flood
   event simulation, with a mean Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of

   performance. The simulated peak flows tend to be smaller than the
   observations, and the simulated time lags of occurrence are changeable.
   This study finds that IMERG and Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission

Abstract = {{Hereditary hemoglobin disorders are among the most common inherited
   diseases globally. In Oman, the burden of hereditary hemoglobin
   disorders has long been recognized as a major public health problem. In
   Oman, the prevalence of SCD ranges between 0.2 and 0.3\% and of
   homozygous B-thalassemia was 0.07-0.08\% while the prevalence of sickle
   cell trait and B-thalassemia trait reached up to 4.8-6\% and 2-2.6\%
   respectively. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) had a high
   prevalence in Oman, being 25\% in males and 10\% in females. The
   premarital screening and counseling (PMSC) program is an important
   preventative service for the most common hereditary hemoglobin disorders
   in Oman. The aim of this research is to study the attitude of those with
   abnormal premarital screening results and the impact of these results.
   This cross-sectional study was carried out in all primary healthcare
   centers in the Muscat governorate in 2018 to analyze abnormal premarital
   screening (PMS) tests results which mainly include sickle cell disease,
   thalassemia, and G6PD deficiency. Data were collected through telephone
   questionnaires with those with abnormal PMS test results. The
   questionnaire consisted of 3 parts investigating sociodemographic
   characteristics, attitudes toward PMS, and impact of the screening on
   participants. Of the 159 participants, 72.3\% were between 20 and 29
   years of age. Over two-thirds (71.5\%) took PMS test while engaged.
   Consanguineous marriage was reported in 38.4\% of married participants.
   The majority (94.3\%) of participants believed PMSC to be important and
   (90\%) agreed PMS should be obligatory before marriage. Half took the
   test as a personal decision while 17\% complied with their spouse.
   Healthcare worker advice accounted for 21.4\% of participants'
   decisions. Participant response to positive PMS results showed that 23\%
   canceled their engagement, while 13.8\% continued with marriage.
   Overall, 57.9\% believed that PMS affected their lives positively. There
   is a relatively high favorable attitude toward PMSC. More effort is
   needed to raise public awareness regarding early PMS. Additionally,
   further genetic counseling before and after PMS testing is essential for
   the program's success.}},

Abstract = {{Photoinduced intra- and interlayer electron transfer (ET) of doubly
   bridged donor-acceptor molecule, porphyrin-fullerene dyad (PF), was
   studied in single- and multi-layered Langmuir-Schafer (LS) films and in
   LS films, where PF and an efficient electron donating polymer
   polyhexyltiophene (PHT) formed a bilayer PHT/PF and multi-layered PHT/PF
   structures. The ET through layers were investigated by a method, which
   measures the photovoltaic (PV) response proportional to the number of
   charge-separated (CS) states and to the CS distance between the
   electrons and holes formed in pulsed photo-excitation. Primary
   conclusions were, that ET starts as formations of CS dyads (P+F-) in
   single-layers, continues as long-range intra-layer charge migrations
   following interlayer CS between two adjacent monolayers. Quantitative
   conclusions were, that the interlayer ET efficiency is 100\% in the
   bi-layered PF structure (2PF), where two CS dyads in adjacent layers
   forms CS complexes (P+F/PF-) and that the probability to form longer or
   higher order of CS complexes follows an expression of a convergent
   geometric series, with a converting factor of 2/3. In the PHT/PF bilayer
   structure the ET efficiency was one order of magnitude higher, than that
   for the 2PF structure due to the ET from the CS dyads to ground state
   electron donor PHT, with an acceptor density, much higher than that of
   (P+F-).}},

Abstract = {{Text classification could be defined as the way of allocating text into
   predefined groups according to its contents. Over the past few years, an
   increase emerged in the volume of information in the varied fields on
   the Internet, thus making the classification of texts one of the most
   important, yet challenging. Text classification is commonly employed in
   numerous applications and for different objectives. The extensive and
   broad use of the Internet, particularly in the Arab world, as well as
   the massive number of the documents and pages which are provided in the
   Arabic language, raised the need for having suitable tools for
   classification of these pages and documents by their main categories.
   The aim of this paper to study the effect of the improved CHI (ImpCHI)
   Square on the performance of six well-known classifiers: Random Forest,
   Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Naive Bayes Multinomial, Bayes Net, and
   Artificial Neural Networks. These proposed techniques are quite
   important for improving classification of Arabic documents and can be
   regarded as a promising basis for the stage of text classification
   because it contributes to the classification of the texts into
   predefined categories. This combination method takes the advantages of
   more than one technique, which can produce better results in the final
   outcomes. The dataset employed in this paper includes 9055 Arabic
   documents that were collected from various Arabic resources. Based on
   their content, these documents were divided into twelve categories. Four
   performance evaluation criteria were used: the F-measure, recall,
   precision, and Time build model. The experimental results show that the
   use of ImpCHI square gives better classification results than the normal
   CHI square method with all studied classifiers, in terms of all used
   performance criteria.}},

Title = {{The Prevalence of Intestinal Parasites and Their Associated Factors
   among Diabetes Mellitus Patients at the University of Gondar Referral
   Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Background. Worldwide, more than one-sixth of the population is infected
   by intestinal parasites, of which the majority live in developing
   countries. On the other hand, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus has
   been increasing over recent decades in developing countries. Patients
   with diabetes mellitus encountered impaired immunity and suffer from the
   consequences of infection particularly intestinal parasitic infection.
   Objective. This study is aimed at assessing the prevalence of intestinal
   parasites and associated factors among diabetes mellitus patients at the
   University of Gondar Referral Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia. Methods and
   Materials. An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted at
   the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Referral Hospital
   from February 15 to March 30, 2018. A total of 234 diabetes mellitus
   patients were enrolled. A systematic random sampling technique was used
   to select study participants. Sociodemographic and clinical data were
   collected using a semistructured questionnaire. A 5-gram stool sample
   was collected to identify parasitic infection using a direct wet mount
   and formal-ether concentration technique. Data was entered and analyzed
   by using SPSS version 20. A p value of <= 0.05 was considered as
   statistically significant. Result. In the current study, the overall
   prevalence of intestinal parasite infection among diabetics was 45
   (19.2\%). The parasites identified in this study were Ascaris
   lumbricoides 15 (6.41\%), Entamoeba histolytica/dispar 9 (3.85\%),
   Hookworm 9 (3.85\%), Schistosoma mansoni 7 (3\%), Enterobius
   vermicularis 3 (1.3\%), and Giardia lamblia 2 (0.9\%). Poor educational
   background (AOR=3.62; 95\% CI (1.038, 12.65); p=0.043), poor hygiene and
   sanitation (AOR=4.67; 95\% CI (1.82, 12.07); p=0.001), and inappropriate
   latrine usage (AOR=5.41; 95\% CI (1.43, 20.56); p=0.013) were
   significantly associated with the prevalence of intestinal parasitic
   infection among diabetes mellitus patients. Conclusion. The overall
   prevalence of intestinal parasitic infection among diabetes mellitus
   patients was relatively high. There should be continued prevention,
   control, and management of intestinal parasitic infection in such a
   study population.}},

Abstract = {{An unprecedented molecular 2Fe-2As precursor complex was synthesized and
   transformed under soft reaction conditions to produce an active and
   long-term stable nanocrystalline FeAs material for electrocatalytic
   water oxidation in alkaline media. The 2Fe2As-centred beta-diketiminato
   complex, having an unusual planar Fe2As2 core structure, results from
   the salt-metathesis reaction of the corresponding beta-diketiminato
   (FeCl)-Cl-II complex and the AsCO- (arsaethynolate) anion as the
   monoanionic As- source. The as-prepared FeAs phase produced from the
   precursor has been electrophoretically deposited on conductive electrode
   substrates and shown to act as a electro(pre)catalyst for the oxygen
   evolution reaction (OER). The deposited FeAs undergoes corrosion under
   the severe anodic alkaline conditions which causes extensive dissolution
   of As into the electrolyte forming finally an active two-line
   ferrihydrite phase (Fe2O3(H2O)(x)). Importantly, the dissolved As in the
   electrolyte can be fully recaptured (electro-deposited) at the counter
   electrode making the complete process eco-conscious. The results
   represent a new and facile entry to unexplored nanostructured
   transition-metal arsenides and their utilization for high-performance
   OER electrocatalysis, which are also known to be magnificent
   high-temperature superconductors.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS}},
Abstract = {{The income-inequality relationship is often addressed in the literature
   and studies also reporting significant effects between income and the
   various measures of inequality. An important question is whether there
   is not only correlation but also causality in the income-inequality
   nexus. For investigating the latter purpose, a Granger causality test
   based on out-of-sample forecast errors is applied with data from 2006 to
   2018 for per capita real income, Gini coefficients and poverty rates for
   sixty-one provinces in Vietnam. In this case, there is not detected any
   significant effects from inequality (Gini) or the level of poverty rates
   to income - and likewise no evidence of the reverse causality.}},

Abstract = {{Aqueous-stable, Cd- and Pb-free colloidal quantum dots with fluorescence
   properties in the second near-infrared region (NIR-II, 1000-1400) are
   highly desirable for non-invasive deep-tissue optical imaging and
   biosensing. The low band-gap semiconductor, silver chalcogenide, offers
   a non-toxic and stable alternative to existing Pd, As, Hg and Cd-based
   NIR-II colloidal quantum dots (QDs). We report facile access to NIR-II
   emission windows with Ag2X (X = S, Se) QDs using easy-to-prepare
   thio/selenourea precursors and their analogues. The aqueous phase
   transfer of these QDs with a high conservation of fluorescence quantum
   yield (retention up to similar to 90\%) and colloidal stability is
   demonstrated. A bimodal NIR-II/MRI contrast agent with a tunable
   fluorescence and high T-1 relaxivity of 408 mM(-1) s(-1) per QD (size
   similar to 2.2 nm) and 990 mM(-1) s(-1) per QD (size similar to 4.2 nm)
   has been prepared by grafting 50 and 120 monoaqua Gd(III) complexes
   respectively to two differently sized Ag2S QDs. The size of the
   nanocrystals is crucial for tuning the Gd payload and the relaxivity.}},

Abstract = {{In developing organic semiconductor polymers for photovoltaic
   applications, chlorine substitution has become an effective strategy in
   replacing fluorine substitution to overcome the drawbacks of low yield
   and high cost, commonly associated with fluorination. In general,
   several molecular positions are available for chlorination. To obtain a
   clear understanding of the impact of chlorine substitution on the
   intrinsic polymer properties, an investigation of structure-property
   relationships is necessary. Herein, four donor-acceptor type polymers
   with the same conjugated backbone and flexible alkyl chains, but with
   chlorine atoms in different positions, are employed to systematically
   investigate the effect of the site of chlorination on the optoelectronic
   properties and photovoltaic performance. Substitution of fluorine by
   chlorine in the backbone slightly increases open circuit voltage (V-oc)
   and fill factor (FF) of the solar cells but causes a loss of
   short-circuit current density (J(sc)). The introduction of chlorine in
   the conjugated side chains, however, significantly improves V-oc, FF,
   and power conversion efficiency, benefiting from a lower HOMO energy
   level, efficient and well-balanced transport properties, and superior
   nanoscale morphology.}},

Abstract = {{An important form of biological sulfur is sulfane sulfur, or S-0, which
   is found in polysulfide and persulfide compounds as well as in elemental
   sulfur. Sulfane sulfur, often in the form of S-8, functions as a key
   energy source in the metabolic processes of thermophilic Archaean
   organisms found in sulfur-rich environments and can be metabolized both
   aerobically and anaerobically by different archaeons. Despite this
   importance, S-8 has a low solubility in water (similar to 19 nM),
   raising questions of how it can be made chemically accessible in complex
   environments. Motivated by prior crystallographic data showing S-8
   binding to hydrophobic motifs in filamentous glycoproteins from the
   sulfur reducing Staphylothermus marinus anaerobe, we demonstrate that
   simple macrocyclic hydrophobic motifs, such as 2-hydroxypropyl
   beta-cyclodextrin (2HP beta), are sufficient to solubilize S-8 at
   concentrations up to 2.0 +/- 0.2 mM in aqueous solution. We demonstrate
   that the solubilized S-8 can be reduced with the common reductant
   tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) and reacts with thiols to generate
   H2S. The thiol-mediated conversion of 2HP beta/S-8 to H2S ranges from
   80\% to quantitative efficiency for Cys and glutathione (GSH). Moreover,
   we demonstrate that 2HP beta can catalyze the Cys-mediated reduction of
   S-8 to H2S in water. Adding to the biological relevance of the developed
   systems, we demonstrate that treatment of Raw 264.7 macrophage cells
   with the 2HP beta/S-8 complex prior to LPS stimulation decreases NO2-
   levels, which is consistent with known activities of bioavailable H2S
   and sulfane sulfur. Taken together, these investigations provide a new
   strategy for delivering H2S and sulfane sulfur in complex systems and
   more importantly provide new insights into the chemical accessibility
   and storage of S-0 and S-8 in biological environments.}},

Abstract = {{Tools to describe isostructurality are important in the understanding of
   close packing principles and in the fine-tuning of crystal properties.
   In order to present how different methods work in practice, a series of
   2-phenylbenzimidazole derivatives substituted on the phenyl ring in the
   ortho, meta and para positions or simultaneously in two different
   positions by F, Cl and Br were selected. The flexibility of the
   phenylbenzimidazole frame permits a gradual isostructural change of the
   structures with step-by-step alteration of the internal arrangement as
   well as of the lengths of the unit cells perpendicular to the
   determining N-H center dot center dot center dot N hydrogen bonded
   chains. The exchange of the different halogen substituents alters the
   angle between the neighbouring benzimidazole moieties and the system of
   the secondary interactions, and finally the isostructurality is
   terminated. The series of isostructural crystals look like a lab jack
   lifted at different heights. Although the neighbouring members of the
   series are highly similar, the extremes of the list vary deliberately
   keeping the space group and Z. This raises the question about the
   extents of structural differences what we still consider isostructural.
   The preference of certain intermolecular interactions divides the
   investigated isostructural Pbca crystals into two subgroups like a
   switch. The definition of isostructurality does not consider
   supramolecular similarity, although it may have a determining role as
   shown. It is presented how isostructurality can be described by
   numerical descriptors. Cell similarity (pi), isostructurality (I-s), and
   molecular isometricity indices are calculated. Correlations of the
   molecular conformation, secondary interactions and the crystallographic
   parameters are revealed by statistical methods. With the use of these
   methods, we provide an easy way to recognise and to characterize
   isostructurality. We show that the prerequisites of isostructurality are
   the similar composition and conformation of the compounds, with their
   analogous molecular and supramolecular arrangement in the crystals
   having the same space group and Z. Exploitation of the Cambridge
   Structural Database for systematical investigations to complete the
   isostructural series is essential.}},

Abstract = {{The multicenter (pancake) bonding between cation-radicals of
   tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene, TMTSF+, tetramethyltetrathiafulvalene,
   TMTTF+, and bis(ethylenedithio)-tetrathiafulvalene, ET+, was compared to
   that of tetrathiafulvalene, TTF+. To minimize counter-ion effects, the
   cation-radical salts with weakly coordinating anions (WCA),
   tetrakis(3,5-trifluoromethylphenyl)borate, dodecamethylcarborane and
   hexabromocarborane were prepared. Solid-state (X-ray and EPR)
   measurements revealed diamagnetic pi-dimers in the TMTSF and ET salts
   and the separate monomers in the TTF salts with all WCAs, while TMTTF
   existed as a dimer in one and a monomer in two salts. The
   variable-temperature UV-Vis studies of these salts in solution showed
   that the thermodynamics of formation of the pi-bonded dimers of TMTTF+
   was close to that of TTF+, while TMTSF+ and ET+ showed a higher
   propensity for pi-dimerization. These data indicated that the
   replacement of sulfur with heavier selenium or insertion of
   ethylenedithia-substituents into the TTF core increases the pi-dimers'
   stability. Yet, computational analysis indicated that the weakly
   covalent component of pi-bonding decreases in the order TTF > TMTTF >
   TMTSF > ET. The higher stability of the pi-dimers of TMTSF+ and ET+
   cation-radicals was related to a decrease of the electrostatic repulsion
   between cationic counter-parts and an increase of dispersion components
   in these associations.}},

Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{43}},
Pages = {{22657-22665}},
Month = {{NOV 21}},
Abstract = {{Here we expand our recently reported Bristol-Xi'an Jiaotong (BXJ)
   approach using simple salts to fine-tune the porosity of conjugated
   microporous materials synthesized by various reaction approaches,
   including Buchwald-Hartwig (BH), Sonogashira-Hagihara, oxidative
   coupling and Suzuki cross-coupling. The surface area and the porosity of
   the produced conjugated microporous polyanilines (CMPAs) acquired from
   the non-salt-added BH coupling are optimized by the addition of
   inorganic salts. BXJ-salt addition provides a facile route to radically
   improve the BET surface area from 28 to 901 m(2) g(-1) for PTAPA and
   from 723 m(2) g(-1) to 1378 m(2) g(-1) for PAPA in a controllable
   manner. In addition, the surface area shows a gradual decrease with an
   increase in the ionic radius of salts. We furthermore show high
   compatibility of this approach in the synthesis of typical CMPs, further
   increasing the surface area from 886 to 1148 m(2) g(-1), 981 to 1263
   m(2) g(-1), and 35 to 215 m(2) g(-1) for CMP-1, PTCT and p-PPF,
   respectively. More importantly, the BXJ approach also allows the broad
   PSD of the CMPs to be narrowed to the microporous range only, mimicking
   COFs and MOFs. With the porosity optimized, CO2 uptakes are dramatically
   improved by >300\% from 0.75 mmol g(-1) to 2.59 mmol g(-1) for PTAPA and
   from 2.41 mmol g(-1) to 2.93 mmol g(-1) for PAPA. Careful addressing of
   Hansen solubility parameters (HSPs) of solvents and resulting polymers
   through salt addition has the potential to become an important design
   tool for the preparation of fully tuneable porous materials. We are
   currently exploring further methods to tune both structure and function
   in a wide range of organic porous materials.}},

Abstract = {{In the pharmaceutical area, to obtain structures with desired
   properties, one can design and perform a screening of multicomponent
   forms of a drug. However, there is an infinite number of molecules that
   can be used as co-formers. Aiming to avoid spending time and money in
   failed experiments, scientists are always trying to optimize the
   selection of co-formers with high probability to co-crystallize with the
   drug. Here, the authors propose the use of statistical tools from the
   Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) to select the co-formers
   to be used in a pharmaceutical screening of new crystal forms of the
   antiretroviral drug nevirapine (NVP). The H-bond propensity (HBP),
   coordination values (CV), and molecular complementarity (MC) tools were
   optimized for multicomponent analysis and a dataset of 450 molecules was
   ranked by a consensus ranking. The results were compared with CosmoQuick
   co-crystal prediction results and they were also compared to
   experimental data to validate the methodology. As a result of the
   experimental screening, three new co-crystals - NVP-benzoic acid,
   NVP-3-hydroxybenzoic acid, and NVP-gentisic acid - were achieved and the
   structures are reported. Since each tool assesses a different aspect of
   supramolecular chemistry, a consensus ranking can be considered a
   helpful strategy for selecting co-formers. At the same time, this type
   of work proves to be useful for understanding the target molecule and
   analyzing which tool may exhibit more significance in co-former
   selection.}},

Abstract = {{The detection and control of invasive alien species in marine ecosystems
   is especially challenging because it is difficult to visualize the full
   extension of an invasion, while control options are often limited. The
   invasive scleractinian coral Tubastraea coccinea have spread over 8000
   km of the Atlantic coastline, from Florida in the USA to southern
   Brazil, mainly in association with oil and gas platforms. This invasive
   coral threatens endemic species, reduces native coral recruitment, and
   modifies communities and trophic interactions, posing a relevant threat
   to shallow Atlantic reefs. The main aim of our study was to assess the
   effectiveness of an ongoing T. coccinea control program by analyzing the
   results of control interventions on population structure and cover of
   the target species in its southern Atlantic limit of distribution. We
   also describe the reproductive effort of T. coccinea in a 12-month time
   span. Between 2012 and 2019, almost 14,000 colonies were removed, most
   of them of small size (< 5 polyps). The highest reproductive effort was
   observed in September. Changes in T. coccinea cover, population
   structure and potential local propagule supply were observed. Control
   activities led to a reduction in up to half the cover of the invaded
   area, maintained the majority of the population in non-reproductive
   sizes, and consequently lowered the potential local propagule supply.
   Our paper highlights the fundamental role of control in preventing the
   local spread of T. coccinea. Recommendations on management frequency and
   timing are also discussed in order to contribute to the improvement of
   management efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{The Problem.
   The pandemic and subsequent changes to norms and practices in the
   workplace mean that for many, existing meaning-making structures are
   challenged and the limits of existing ways of knowing are revealed. The
   problem for HRD scholars and practitioners is that dominant approaches
   to research are largely insufficient for understanding individuals'
   meaning making in response to the pandemic.
   The Recommendations.
   Two critically reflexive method/ologies are presented and overlaid with
   Constructive-Developmental Theory (CDT) to offer not only a means of
   capturing data about individuals' experiences during/post-pandemic but
   for interpreting the data with an understanding of the mental
   complexities associated with capturing an emic perspective.
   The Stakeholders.

Abstract = {{Recently, circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been revealed to be an important
   non-coding element of the transcriptome. The brain contains the most
   abundant and widespread expression of circRNA. There are also
   indications that the circular transcriptome undergoes dynamic changes as
   a result of brain ageing. Diminished cognitive function with increased
   age reflects the dysregulation of synaptic function and ineffective
   neurotransmission through alterations of the synaptic proteome. Here, we
   present changes in the circular transcriptome in ageing synapses using a
   mouse model. Specifically, we observed an accumulation of uniquely
   expressed circular transcripts in the synaptosomes of aged mice compared
   to young mice. Individual circRNA expression patterns were characterized
   by an increased abundance in the synaptosomes of young or aged mice,
   whereas the opposite expression was observed for the parental gene
   linear transcripts. These changes in expression were validated by
   RT-qPCR. We provide the first comprehensive survey of the circular
   transcriptome in mammalian synapses, thereby paving the way for future
   studies. Additionally, we present 16 genes that express solely circRNAs,
   without linear RNAs co-expression, exclusively in young and aged
   synaptosomes, suggesting a synaptic gene network that functions along
   canonical splicing activity. (C) 2020 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Defect complexes play critical roles in the dynamics of water molecules
   in photoelectrochemical cell devices. For the specific case of hematite
   (alpha-Fe2O3), iron and oxygen vacancies are said to mediate the water
   splitting process through the localization of optically-derived charges.
   Using first-principles methods based on density-functional theory we
   show that both iron and oxygen vacancies can be observed at the surface.
   For an oxygen-rich environment, usually under wet conditions, the
   charged iron vacancies should be more frequent. As sea water would be an
   ideal electrolyte for this kind of device, we have also analyzed the
   effect of additional chlorine adsorption on this surface. While the
   chlorine adatom kills the charged oxygen vacancies, entering the void
   sites, it will not react with the iron vacancies, keeping them active
   during water splitting processes.}},

Abstract = {{Among many seismic inversion methods, the sparse spike inversion for
   post-stack seismic data uses the migrated and stacked seismic data which
   is regarded as zero offset reflection seismic data in the case of normal
   incidence to extract reflectivity and impedance of underground rocks.
   The seismic reflectivity and impedance can reflect underground rocks'
   lithology, petrophysical property, oil-gas possibility, and so forth.
   However, the common used post-stack seismic inversion adopts single
   trace in the process of inversion and completes the whole data cube's
   inversion through trace by trace. It cannot use lateral regularization.
   Hence, the lateral continuity of single trace inversion result is poor.
   It is difficult to represent the lateral variation features of
   underground rocks. Based on the conventional sparse spike inversion, the
   nuclear norm of matrix in the matrix completion theory is introduced in
   the process of post-stack seismic inversion. At the same time, the
   strategy of multi-trace seismic data simultaneous inversion is used to
   carry out lateral regularization constraint. Numerical tests on 2D model
   indicate that the inversion results obtained from the proposed method
   can clearly represent not only the vertical variation features but also
   the lateral variation features of underground rocks. At last, the
   inversion results of real seismic data further show the feasibility and
   superiority of the proposed method in practical application.}},

   Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in the Iranian Population}},

Abstract = {{Background. Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide.
   MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene
   expression and may act as both tumor suppressors and as oncogenes. The
   presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) inside the miRNA
   genomic region could affect target miRNA maturation, expression, and
   binding to its target mRNA and contribute to cancer development.
   Previous studies on the SNPs Rs2910164 in miR-146a and Rs767649 in
   miR-155 showed association with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
   development. Thus, the aim of this study was to detect any correlation
   between those SNPs in Iranian NSCLC patients. Methods. In a small cohort
   study, 165 NSCLC patients and 147 noncancer controls were enrolled
   between Apr 2015 and Sep 2019 at the Masih Daneshvari Hospital, Tehran,
   Iran. Allele frequencies from the genomic DNA of blood cells were
   studied using PCR-RFLP and their association with the risk of lung
   cancer was evaluated. Results. The rs2910164C allele (OR = 1.56, 95\% CI
   = 1.10-2.21, p=0.012) and CC genotype (OR = 2.93, 95\% CI = 1.07-7.9,
   p=0.034, respectively) were associated with a significantly increased
   risk for lung cancer compared to that for the GG genotype. When patients
   were stratified according to smoking exposure, no association with
   rs2910164 variants was found. The AT genotype (OR = 0.57, 95\% CI =
   0.33-0.99, p=0.048) and the A allele frequency (OR = 0.58, 95\% CI =
   0.35-0.98, p=0.043) in rs767649 were lower in NSCLC patients in
   comparison with the control group. In addition, the rs767649 AT genotype
   frequency in smoking controls was higher than in smoking NSCLC patients
   (OR = 0.44, 95\% CI = 0.21-0.90, p=0.024). No association was found
   between rs2910164 and rs767649 variants and stage or type of NSCLC.
   Conclusion. Our finding suggests that miR-146a rs2910164 and miR-155
   rs767649 polymorphisms may be considered as genetic risk factors for the
   susceptibility to NSCLC in the Iranian population. However, a larger
   multicenter study across Iran is needed to confirm these findings.}},

Abstract = {{Context Biological weed control by seed predators is an ecosystem
   service reducing weed population densities in agricultural landscapes.
   Drivers of seed predation are manifold and may change with spatial
   scales considered. Objectives We aimed at identifying the functional
   identity of seed predators, food web interactions and feeding links
   between weed and wheat seeds, considering the causal relationships
   between local and landscape-scale patterns. Methods We investigated
   direct and indirect effects of local management intensity in winter
   wheat fields (organic vs. conventional farming), local crop
   characteristics (wheat density and height), edge effects, landscape
   composition (measured as land-use diversity) and configuration (edge
   length) on carabid beetles of different body size (large vs. small
   carabids), and removal of weed and wheat seeds. Results We showed the
   importance of indirect local- and landscape-scale effects for weed seed
   removal via the activity density, but not assemblage composition, of
   large, but not small carabids, which was driven by few ubiquitous
   species. The activity density of large carabids increased with
   decreasing wheat density and increasing wheat height, which was highest
   in organic fields and in landscapes with low compositional and
   configurational heterogeneity. Further, the availability of
   nutrient-rich wheat seeds enhanced weed seed removal rates. Conclusions
   We found highest weed seed removal via large carabids in organic fields
   in large-scale agricultural landscapes. Predator body size and species
   identity as well as the availability of additional food items need to be
   taken into account for better predicting the biological weed control
   potential and reducing the use of plant protection products.}},

Abstract = {{Scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM) have attracted great
   attention as one of the most promising candidates for imaging soft and
   delicate biological samples. In this review, firstly, up to date
   research on investigating samples' surface properties using SICM are
   demonstrated. In surface charge part, as the bias is varied, a
   polarity-dependent ion current and surface-induced rectification can
   help SICM to create images of surface charge. In dynamics of living
   cells part, SICM allows both non-labeling and non-contact during the
   measurement and performs the best smong fluorescent microscopy and AFM
   in visualizing dynamics of living cells. In surface morphology part,
   four examples are demonstrated to show SICM's power. Secondly,
   combinations with mature technology such as scanning electrochemical
   microscopy (SECM), sub-aperture stitching technology, stimulated
   emission depletion (STED) microscopy and protein nanopores are present,
   which achieve the multifunction of SICM. Thirdly, state-of-the-art ways
   that can improve imaging rate are demonstrated. Finally, a brief future
   outlook for SICM is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The nexus of gender-agriculture-emissions reduction is one of the least
   explored areas related to agriculture and climate change. This nexus
   plays an important role in the areas where women's participation in
   agriculture is high, and the contribution of the agricultural sector to
   total emission is significant. This study generates evidence on women's
   labor contribution in rice cultivation and potential reduction of their
   labor drudgery, including GHG mitigation co-benefits with the adoption
   of direct seeding and machine transplanting technologies. Using a large
   number of plot-level data (11,987 data points) from the rice-growing
   regions of India, the study shows that changing rice production
   technology from conventional to direct-seeded rice (DSR) and/or
   machine-transplanted rice (MTR) offers huge potential to reduce women's
   labor in rice planting (745 million labor-days for DSR and 610 million
   labor-days for MTR) and greenhouse gases (GHG) emission (34 MtCO(2)e for
   DSR and 7 MtCO(2)e for MTR) at the same time. This potential differs
   from the agro-ecological region, the level of input use, and women's
   involvement in rice cultivation. The realization of this
   gender-responsive GHG mitigation strategy depends on the adoption of
   these technologies, which rely on several social, economic, and
   political factors. At the same time, the immense potential for negative
   implications for some specific groups should not be ignored, but focused
   on addressing and mitigating those challenges.}},

Abstract = {{Levoglucosenone ((1S,5R)-6,8-dioxabicyclo{[}3.2.1]oct-2-en-4-one or LGO;
   CAS number: 37112-31-5) is an extensively studied biomass based chemical
   and its potential applications in organic synthesis, as well as in the
   extraction of various natural substances, have been established;
   therefore developing dependable, yet fast and simple analytical methods
   for determining LGO in the products of thermochemical biomass processing
   is of great importance. In this work different UHPLC methods have been
   developed and compared for the determination of LGO in wood pyrolysis
   products. In addition to UV detection, LGO determination conditions by
   single quadrupole mass spectrometry have been adjusted with and without
   chemical derivatization. The ionization of LGO in the positive and
   negative electrospray ionisation mode and the effect of a mobile phase
   additive on LGO and its degradation product ionisation have been
   evaluated. Using the UHPLC-UV system, a method for the quantification of
   levoglucosenone was developed and the analytical parameters of the
   method were determined. Utilising the developed UHPLC-UV method, studies
   of LGO stability in standard solution and in fast pyrolysis products
   were carried out in various solvent systems at different temperatures
   and pH levels. The main LGO primary degradation product has been
   confirmed to be furfural. It has been concluded that the degradation
   rate of LGO is significantly affected by the solvent and storage
   temperature, so it is essential that LGO standard solutions and samples
   are analysed when freshly prepared. Using a UHPLC-MS system and
   derivatization with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH), a method for the
   determination of LGO was developed and the method analytical parameters
   were tested. To sum up, quantitative determination of LGO in pyrolysis
   products can be performed by reversed phase UHPLC-UV without any
   particular sample preparation, but in the case of UHPLC-MS it is
   necessary to derivatize LGO with DNPH to ensure ionisation of LGO. The
   additional work, requiring MS detection, can be outweighed by the
   greater selectivity compared to that of the more straightforward UV
   detection method in cases of incomplete chromatographic separation.}},

Abstract = {{Resource allocation is a fundamental task in any PON and it is necessary
   to have an efficient scheme that reduces delay, maximizes bandwidth
   usage, and minimizes the resource wastage. A variety of dynamic
   bandwidth allocation (DBA) and dynamic wavelength and bandwidth
   allocation (DWBA) algorithms have been proposed which are based on
   different PONs (e.g., EPON, GPON, XG-PON, 10G EPON, etc.). But to our
   knowledge, no DWBA scheme for NG-PON2 system, with diverse customers and
   prioritized traffic, has been proposed yet. In this work, this problem
   is addressed and five different dynamic wavelength and bandwidth
   allocation (DWBA) schemes are proposed. First, mixed integer linear
   programming (MILP) models are developed to minimize the total delay of
   the high-priority data. Due to the MILP's high computational complexity,
   heuristic algorithms are developed based on the MILP model insights. The
   five heuristic algorithms are: No Block-Split Heuristic (NBH), Equal
   Block-Split Heuristic (EBH), Priority-Based No Block-Split Heuristic
   (P-NBH), Priority-Based Equal Block-Split Heuristic (P-EBH), and
   Priority-Based Decider Block-Split Heuristic (P-DBH). Six priority
   classes of requests are introduced with the goal of minimizing the total
   delay for the high-priority data and to lessen the bandwidth wastage of
   the system. Finally, experiments for the performance evaluation of the
   five DWBA schemes are conducted. The results indicate that P-NBH, P-EBH,
   P-DBH schemes show a 47.63\% less delay and 30\% of less bandwidth
   wastage on average for the highest priority data transmission than the
   schemes without priority support (NBH and EBH). Among these five
   schemes, NBH method has the highest delay, whereas EBH and P-EBH waste
   more bandwidth than the other schemes. P-DBH is the most efficient among
   the five, because this scheme offers the lowest delay for high-priority
   data and the minimum bandwidth wastage for lower priority ones.}},

Title = {{Coarse graining molecular dynamics with graph neural networks}},

Abstract = {{Coarse graining enables the investigation of molecular dynamics for
   larger systems and at longer timescales than is possible at an atomic
   resolution. However, a coarse graining model must be formulated such
   that the conclusions we draw from it are consistent with the conclusions
   we would draw from a model at a finer level of detail. It has been
   proved that a force matching scheme defines a thermodynamically
   consistent coarse-grained model for an atomistic system in the
   variational limit. Wang et al. {[}ACS Cent. Sci. 5, 755 (2019)]
   demonstrated that the existence of such a variational limit enables the
   use of a supervised machine learning framework to generate a
   coarse-grained force field, which can then be used for simulation in the
   coarse-grained space. Their framework, however, requires the manual
   input of molecular features to machine learn the force field. In the
   present contribution, we build upon the advance of Wang et al. and
   introduce a hybrid architecture for the machine learning of
   coarse-grained force fields that learn their own features via a
   subnetwork that leverages continuous filter convolutions on a graph
   neural network architecture. We demonstrate that this framework succeeds
   at reproducing the thermodynamics for small biomolecular systems. Since
   the learned molecular representations are inherently transferable, the
   architecture presented here sets the stage for the development of
   machine-learned, coarse-grained force fields that are transferable
   across molecular systems.}},

Title = {{Quantum cutting-induced near-infrared luminescence of Yb3+ and Er3+ in a
   layer structured perovskite film}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{153}},

Abstract = {{Quantum cutting is an attractive optical phenomenon where one
   high-energy photon is converted into two low-energy photons, resulting
   in photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) above 100\%. In this report,
   we demonstrate a novel approach to enhance the quantum cutting energy
   transfer from an all-inorganic perovskite (CsPbCl3) to ytterbium (Yb3+)
   and erbium (Er3+) ions as near-infrared (NIR) emitters by using the
   highly orientated crystalline film. Yb3+ ions are fixed in the
   neighborhood of the CsPbCl3 lattice by preparing a one-to-one layer
   arrangement consisting of quasi-2D CsPbCl3 perovskite and Yb3+ layers.
   The successful preparation of layer arrangements resulted in the highly
   sensitized luminescence of Yb3+ by CsPbCl3 with NIR PLQYs exceeding
   130\%, which is attributed to quantum cutting. In addition, Er3+
   luminescence at 1540 nm is acquired by the co-existence of Er3+ with
   Yb3+ in a layer, which is a result of the intralayer metal-to-metal
   energy transfer from Yb3+ activated by CsPbCl3 via the interlayer
   quantum cutting process. The PLQY of Er3+ luminescence reaches to
   12.6\%, which is the highest value ever observed for Er3+ compounds,
   resulting from the efficient interlayer quantum cutting process over
   100\% and the following intralayer resonance metal to metal energy
   transfer with the efficiency over 80\%.}},

Abstract = {{Snow trout Schizothorax labiatus constitute a significant part of the
   diet of large human population of colder regions of the Indian Himalayan
   subcontinent, and are also important for local livelihoods there. In the
   present study, the hematological and serum biochemical parameters of S.
   labiatus were examined with respect to sex and season. Hemoglobin (Hb)
   concentration, red blood cell (RBC) count and hematocrit (Hct) were
   higher in males than females in each season, while white blood cell
   (WBC) count were notably higher in females. A significant difference (P
   < 0.05) was noted in Hb concentration, RBC and WBC counts, and Hct
   between males and females during the summer compared to the other
   seasons. There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) between
   erythrocyte indices with respect to sex and season. Serum biochemical
   parameters (glucose, cholesterol and urea) differed significantly (P <
   0.05) between the sexes, as well as among the seasons. However, no
   significant differences (P > 0.05) were observed in biochemical
   parameters (total protein, albumin and globulin) with respect to sex,
   although the highest values of all serum biochemical parameters were
   reported during the summer and the lowest values during the winter. The
   data reported here on the influence of sex and season on hematological
   and biochemical parameters of S. labiatus inhabiting the Sindh River
   could provide a reliable basis for the future monitoring of the health
   status of this fish.}},

Journal = {{WAVES IN RANDOM AND COMPLEX MEDIA}},
Abstract = {{Hybrid and asymptotic methods of diffraction theory used when the
   electric size of a scatterer is large are based on the use of a solution
   for the radiation pattern of a cylindrical wave, which appears when a
   plane wave is scattered by an edge with a given boundary condition. The
   expression of the radiation pattern of a wave scattered by the edge of a
   half-plane with generalized semitransparent boundary conditions has not
   been obtained using the Sommerfeld integral technique. The use of the
   solution for the semitransparent case allows us to expand the asymptotic
   methods to scatterers with semitransparent edges. In this article, based
   on solving the problem of the scattering of a plane wave by a half-plane
   with the generalized semitransparent boundary conditions using the
   Sommerfeld integral technique, we derive a solution for the far-field of
   the cylindrical wave scattered by the semitransparent edge. Based on the
   obtained solution, we derive an expression for the calculation of an
   amendment to the physical optics approximation, which allows us to
   extend the physical theory of diffraction method to scatterers with
   semitransparent edges. We apply the uniform asymptotic theory of
   diffraction method to the problem of cylindrical-wave scattering by the

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{153}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{NOV 21}},
Abstract = {{Mesoporous materials play an important role both in engineering
   applications and in fundamental research of confined fluids. Adsorption
   goes hand in hand with the deformation of the absorbent, which has
   positive and negative sides. It can cause sample aging or can be used in
   sensing technology. Here, we report the theoretical study of
   adsorption-induced deformation of the model mesoporous material with
   ordered corrugated cylindrical pores. Using the classical density
   functional theory in the local density approximation, we compared the
   solvation pressure in corrugated and cylindrical pores for nitrogen at
   sub- and super-critical temperatures. Our results demonstrate
   qualitative differences between solvation pressures in the two
   geometries at sub-critical temperatures. The deviations are attributed
   to the formation of liquid bridges in corrugated pores. However, at
   super-critical temperatures, there is no abrupt bridge formation and
   corrugation does not qualitatively change solvation pressure isotherms.
   We believe that these results could help in the analysis of an
   adsorption-induced deformation of the materials with distorted pores.}},

Abstract = {{Triboelectric energy harvester (TEH) is an emerging technology that has
   been recently demonstrated to harvest mechanical energy. The TEH can be
   fabricated in various configurations due to their flexibility in nature
   and therefore have a wide number of applications. In this paper, a
   simplified model of vertical contact mode triboelectric energy harvester
   has been presented. Commercial Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and thin
   copper film have been considered for the generation of tribocharge. The
   effects of various design parameters and the load resistance on the
   harvested power are investigated under a periodic harmonic motion.
   Numerical results predicted that harvested power depends upon surface
   area, relative permittivity, surface charge density and dielectric
   thickness of triboelectric material, the frequency of contact, distance
   between the electrodes and load resistance. Finally, the optimization of
   design parameters using genetic algorithms is studied in order to
   provide sufficient guidance for the rational development of TEH.
   Simulated results predicted that triboelectric harvesters can generate a
   significant amount of energy that can operate small electronics like
   cell phones, robots, navigation systems, motion, and biological sensors.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives
   To describe the trend in the impact of lower urinary tract symptoms
   attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (LUTS/BPH) on a global scale
   using the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database.
   Materials and Methods
   Using the GBD database, worldwide data aggregated from registries and
   health systems from 1990 to 2017 were filtered for LUTS/BPH diagnoses.
   Calculation of years lived with disability (YLD) were compared with
   other urological diseases. YLD were calculated by a standardized method
   using assigned disability weights. The GBD-defined sociodemographic
   index (SDI) was used to assess impact of LUTS/BPH by global SDI
   quintile.
   Results
   Global Burden of Disease data over the 1990-2017 study period were
   summarized and global numbers and trends noted with other urological
   diseases for comparison. A total of 2 427 334 YLD were attributed to BPH
   in 2017 alone, almost three times more than those attributed to the next
   highest urological disease, prostate cancer (843 227 YLD). When
   stratified by SDI quintile, a much lower impact of BPH was found in the
   bottom three quintiles, despite this subset representing 66.9\% of the
   2017 world population.
   Conclusions
   Lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia
   exert a rapidly rising human burden far exceeding other urological
   diseases. As the population ages and men in a lower SDI enjoy increased
   life expectancy and decreased competing mortalities, a continually
   accelerating wave of LUTS/BPH can be forecast. These epidemiological
   trends have serious implications for the future allocation of resources
   and the global urological workforce.}},

Abstract = {{The Nile rat (Arvicanthis niloticus) is a novel diurnal
   carbohydrate-sensitive rodent useful for studies on type 2 diabetes
   mellitus (T2DM) and the metabolic syndrome. Hepatic responses to T2DM
   and any interventions thereof can be evaluated via transcriptomic gene
   expression analysis. However, the study of gene expression via real-time
   reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)
   requires identification of stably expressed reference genes for accurate
   normalisation. This study describes the evaluation and identification of
   stable reference genes in the livers from Control Nile rats as well as
   those supplemented with Water-Soluble Palm Fruit Extract, which has been
   previously shown to attenuate T2DM in this animal model. Seven genes
   identified as having stable expression in RNA-Sequencing transcriptome
   analysis were chosen for verification using real-time RT-qPCR. Six
   commonly used reference genes from previous literature and two genes
   from a previous microarray gene expression study in Nile rats were also
   evaluated. The expression data of these 15 candidate reference genes
   were analysed using the RefFinder software which incorporated analyses
   performed by various algorithms. The Hpd, Pnpla6 and Vpp2 genes were
   identified as the most stable across the 36 samples tested. Their
   applicability was demonstrated through the normalisation of the gene
   expression profiles of two target genes, Cela1 and Lepr. In conclusion,
   three novel reference genes which can be used for robust normalisation
   of real-time RT-qPCR data were identified, thereby facilitating future
   hepatic gene expression studies in the Nile rat.}},

Abstract = {{Boron is an electron-deficient element. The flatland of planar or
   quasi-planar (2D) boron clusters is believed to possess aromaticity for
   all members, which remains a fundamental issue in debate in boron
   chemistry. Using a selected set of D-2h B-6(2-), C-2h B-28(2-), and C-2v
   B-29(-) clusters as counter examples, we shall present computational
   evidence for global or island pi antiaromaticity in 2D boron clusters.
   The latter two are flattened for the purpose of clarity, which model
   their quasi-planar C-2 or C-s monoanion clusters observed in prior
   gas-phase experiments. Chemical bonding in the clusters is elucidated
   collectively on the basis of canonical molecular orbital (CMO) analysis,
   adaptive natural density partitioning (AdNDP), electron localization
   functions (ELFs), and localized molecular orbital (LMO) analysis. These
   results are complementary to each other and yet highly coherent. As a
   quantitative indicator, nucleus-independent chemical shifts (NICSs) are
   calculated at selected specific points in the clusters, which help
   differentiate between pi aromaticity and antiaromaticity. Intriguingly,
   triangular sites in the same boron cluster can be aromatic,
   antiaromatic, or nonaromatic, despite the fact that they are physically
   indistinguishable. The phenomenon is understood in analogy to
   hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Even perfect
   sheet-like boron clusters are convertible to the PAH analogous systems.
   This work provides compelling examples for global and island pi
   antiaromaticity in the 2D boron clusters.}},

Abstract = {{Azathioprine is a first-line drug used to maintain the remission of
   inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). As a prodrug, azathioprine is
   metabolised to produce active 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN). There
   are large individual variations in the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics
   of 6-TGN in patients with IBD. Here, we aimed to develop a model to
   quantitatively investigate factors that affect 6-TGN pharmacokinetics to
   formulate a dosage guideline for azathioprine. Data were collected
   prospectively from 100 adult patients with IBD who were receiving
   azathioprine. Patients were genotyped for two single-nucleotide
   polymorphisms (TPMT{*}3C c.719A > G and NUDT15 c.415C > T). Using
   high-performance liquid chromatography, we measured 156 steady-state
   trough concentrations of 6-TGN within the range 0.09 to 1.16 mg/L (ie
   133-1733 pmol per 8 x 10(8) RBC). The covariates analysed included sex,
   age, body-weight, laboratory tests and concomitant medications. A
   population pharmacokinetic model was established using ``non-linear
   mixed-effects modelling{''} software and the ``first-order conditional
   estimation method with interaction.{''} Body-weight, TPMT{*}3C
   polymorphisms and co-therapy with mesalazine were found to be important
   factors influencing the clearance of 6-TGN. A dosage guideline for
   azathioprine was developed based on the PPK model that enables
   individualised azathioprine dosing in adult patients with different
   body-weights, TPMT{*}3C genotypes and co-administration with mesalazine.}},

Abstract = {{Plants uniquely have a family of proteins called extra-large G proteins
   (XLG) that share homology in their C-terminal half with the canonical G
   alpha subunits; we carefully detail here that Arabidopsis XLG2 lacks
   critical residues requisite for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis which
   is consistent with our quantitative analyses. Based on microscale
   thermophoresis, Arabidopsis XLG2 binds GTP gamma S with an affinity 100
   times lower than that to canonical G alpha subunits. This means that
   given the concentration range of guanine nucleotide in plant cells, XLG2
   is not likely bound by GTPin vivo. Homology modeling and molecular
   dynamics simulations provide a plausible mechanism for the poor
   nucleotide binding affinity of XLG2. Simulations indicate substantially
   stronger salt bridge networks formed by several key amino-acid residues
   of AtGPA1 which are either misplaced or missing in XLG2. These residues
   in AtGPA1 not only maintain the overall shape and integrity of the
   apoprotein cavity but also increase the frequency of favorable
   nucleotide-protein interactions in the nucleotide-bound state. Despite
   this loss of nucleotide dependency, XLG2 binds the RGS domain of AtRGS1
   with an affinity similar to the Arabidopsis AtGPA1 in its apo-state and
   about 2 times lower than AtGPA1 in its transition state. In addition,
   XLG2 binds the G beta gamma dimer with an affinity similar to that of
   AtGPA1. XLG2 likely acts as a dominant negative G alpha protein to block
   G protein signaling. We propose that XLG2, independent of guanine
   nucleotide binding, regulates the active state of the canonical G
   protein pathway directly by sequestering G beta gamma and indirectly by
   promoting heterodimer formation. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma}},

Abstract = {{Octahedral {[}CaY]F-2 crystals with an average particle size of 1 mu m
   were synthesized via a mild one-step hydrothermal route without
   employing any surfactants. Various morphologies, including cubes,
   truncated cubes, truncated octahedrons, and spheres, were achieved via
   manipulating the amount of EDTA used, and a possible growth mechanism
   was proposed based on the surface energies of different crystal planes
   and the influence of the surfactant. XRD, SEM, EDS, TEM, HRTEM, and PL
   analysis were used to characterize the products. The effects of the
   morphologies and Li+ doping concentrations on the luminescence
   intensities of the {[}CaY]F-2:Ce3+/Tb3+ phosphors were explored, and the
   strongest luminescence intensity is obtained when the sample is cubic
   with (100) crystal faces and the doping concentration of Li+ is 0.25
   mol\%. Additionally, multicolor emission (blue -> aquamarine blue ->
   green) was obtained from {[}CaY]F-2:Ce3+/Tb3+ phosphors via adjusting
   the doping concentration of Tb3+, which resulted from the Ce3+ -> Tb3+
   energy transfer behavior; the energy transfer here happened through a
   dipole-dipole mechanism. This work may result in the as-synthesized
   phosphors having great application potential in many optoelectronic
   device fields, such as in displays and multicolor lighting.}},

Abstract = {{The Finnish wartime landscape was altered by Nazi troops who were
   stationed there during World War Two. This paper examines wartime
   sceneries through Finnish Army Information Company's photographs from
   the period of the war known in Finland as the Continuation War
   (1941-1944). The images reveal a completely different side to the Nazi
   co-belligerence to what is traditionally acknowledged in Finland. I
   discuss the ways the Nazi troops altered the Finnish landscape, adding
   `German-ness ` to their surroundings and more specifically, how Nazi
   ideology manifested in the northern Finnish landscapes. The Finns have
   been completely oblivious to the symbolic messages the Nazis crafted in
   their surroundings. Photographs as haunting representation addresses in
   this paper both the difficult memory of German presence that frames
   these pictures and the specific potency of these photographic
   encounters. Haunting as a theory deals with the evocative ways an image
   can convey information about the past.}},

Abstract = {{Clitoria ternatea (L.) is a medicinal leguminous plant and is cultivated
   to cater the need of herbal industries and asthetic purposes. The
   unavailability of steady molecular marker impedes the genetic
   improvement of C. ternatea. In the present study, transferability of 98
   pairs of Cajanus spp. specific SSR primers were assessed among 14
   genotypes of C. ternatea, varied for their flower color, floral
   architecture and bio-metabolite (taraxerol and delphinidin) content, and
   out of them 43 had successfully amplified the fragments. Among them, 36
   pairs of primers showed 100\% transferability, whereas rest seven varied
   from 42.86 to 92.85\% transferability. The transferable 43 pairs of SSR
   primers generated 196 alleles across the 14 genotypes and the AMOVA
   analysis showed moderate genetic variation (55.1\%) among the genotypes
   of C. ternatea, which was also reinforced by Nei's genetic distance and
   gene identity estimates derived haplotype matrix. Similarly, both the
   principal coordinate analysis and dendrogram grouped these 14 genotypes
   of C. ternatea into two major clusters based on SSR allele distribution
   and frequency, and the clustering pattern is in accordance with petal
   color but in contrast to floral architecture. MCheza based outlier
   analysis revealed 16 alleles for balancing selection, which are
   putatively involved in the maintenance of genetic polymorphism in C.
   ternatea. Moreover, the estimates of molecular diversity and
   bio-metabolite content revealed the possible use of these genotypes in
   future breeding programme of this species.}},

Title = {{Downgrading Deontic Authority in Open Dialogue Reflection Proposals: A
   Conversation AnalysisPalabras clave(sic)(sic)(sic)}},
Journal = {{FAMILY PROCESS}},
Abstract = {{The Open Dialogue approach promotes collaboration with clients and
   families in decisions about the direction of therapy. This creates
   potential problems for Open Dialogue therapists who seek collaboration
   but also have responsibility for managing the session. Using
   conversation analysis, we examined 14 hours of video recordings of Open
   Dialogue sessions, and specifically how therapists proposed the
   transition to a reflecting conversation. We found that, when making
   proposals to reflect, therapists routinely downgrade their deontic
   authority (i.e., adopt a less powerful, more collaborative position).
   They did this through framing proposals as interrogatives, providing
   accounts, and by prefacing their proposals with ``I'm wondering{''}.
   More heavily downgraded proposals made acceptance less salient,
   potentially risking transition to the reflection. These findings provide
   more detail on how theoretical concepts such as ``collaboration{''} and
   ``power{''} are actually displayed and negotiated in practice and can
   contribute to a more nuanced understanding of what constitutes Open
   Dialogue.}},

Abstract = {{Two novel hexagonal tungsten oxide materials, A(GaF2)(3)(SeO3)(2) (A = K
   and NH4), designed by a chemical substitution-oriented method have been
   successfully synthesized via hydrothermal reactions. A(GaF2)(3)(SeO3)(2)
   feature two-dimensional corrugated layered structures composed of GaO2F4
   octahedra, SeO3 trigonal pyramids, and A(+) counter cations. Although
   the title compounds are stoichiometrically equivalent,
   K(GaF2)(3)(SeO3)(2) crystallizes in the centrosymmetric trigonal space
   group, R3m, whereas NH4(GaF2)(3)(SeO3)(2) crystallizes in the
   noncentrosymmetric hexagonal space group, P6(3)mc. UV-vis diffuse
   reflectance spectroscopic analysis indicates that the optical bandgaps
   of K(GaF2)(3)(SeO3)(2) and NH4(GaF2)(3)(SeO3)(2) are very large with the
   values of ca. 5.62 and 5.77, respectively. Noticeably,
   NH4(GaF2)(3)(SeO3)(2) exhibits the largest bandgap among all known
   phase-matchable nonlinear optical selenite compounds. Powder
   second-harmonic generation (SHG) measurements indicate that
   NH4(GaF2)(3)(SeO3)(2) reveals an SHG efficiency of ca. 1.1 times that of
   KDP and is type-I phase-matchable. Complete spectroscopic and thermal
   characterization, calculations, and factors influencing the macroscopic
   centricity will be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The neutron spectral yields from the Li(p,n) reaction has been
   considered as an important study due to its potential use as
   mono-energetic fast neutron source. This reaction has been studied at
   energies nearing Coulomb barrier for mono-energetic neutrons from Be-7
   ground state emissions and at energies beyond few tens of MeV to get the
   quasi mono-energetic fast neutrons, depending on their specific
   applications such as cross section studies, calibration of neutron
   detectors, etc. However, the number of measurements at proton energy of
   8-20 MeV is sparse in the literature. In this energy range, the
   mono-energetic neutrons are strongly interfered by emissions from other
   excited states distorting the emission neutron spectra. Majority of the
   earlier measurements were carried out using carbon as the backing
   material during evaluation of neutron yields to minimize the
   interference of neutrons from the backing material. Here, a commonly
   used thick Ta target was explored as the backing material for the thin
   Li target and the neutron yields were measured with solid polymeric
   neutron track detector, CR-39. This is a passive technique and does not
   require any associated instrumentation during the irradiation process.
   This work presents the estimation of thin target neutron yields from Li
   target by subtracting the neutron yields contributed by the supporting
   material (Ta), which was separately measured in the same physical
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{On 20 March 2019, the Decolonise UoK, formerly Decolonise UKC conference
   took place at the University of Kent (W Ahmed and others, Decolonising
   the Curriculum Project Manifesto: Through the Kaleidoscope (2019) <).
   Out of this came its manifesto to the university with recommendations in
   three key areas (ibid). The end goal of this student-staff collaboration
   was not intended to be a strategic intervention to equality, diversity
   and inclusion (EDI) work within universities although the body of
   knowledge (the manifesto and the Decolonise UoK Collective book, Towards
   Decolonising the University: A Kaleidoscope for Empowered Action
   (Counterpress 2020)) is open access for everyone to read and implement.
   We explore this process of self-empowerment through the concepts of
   (re-)existence/resistance from decolonial studies in combination with
   the black feminist critical race theory (CRT) methods of
   counter-narrating. We discuss the detail of racialised life both as part
   of surviving and through resisting institutional racism and its
   affective impact upon us. We argue that the necessary conditions that
   made it possible to do the work of self-empowerment from our
   intersectional and multiple positionalities across the student-staff
   continuum within the neoliberal university have been trust, courage and
   silence.}},

Abstract = {{When it comes to monitoring of huge structures, main issues are limited
   time, high costs and how to deal with the big amount of data. In order
   to reduce and manage them, respectively, methods from the field of
   optimal design of experiments are useful and supportive. Having optimal
   experimental designs at hand before conducting any measurements is
   leading to a highly informative measurement concept, where the sensor
   positions are optimized according to minimal errors in the structures'
   models. For the reduction of computational time a combined approach
   using Fisher Information Matrix and mean-squared error in a two-step
   procedure is proposed under the consideration of different error types.
   The error descriptions contain random/aleatoric and systematic/epistemic
   portions. Applying this combined approach on a finite element model
   using artificial acceleration time measurement data with artificially
   added errors leads to the optimized sensor positions. These findings are
   compared to results from laboratory experiments on the modeled
   structure, which is a tower-like structure represented by a hollow pipe
   as the cantilever beam. Conclusively, the combined approach is leading
   to a sound experimental design that leads to a good estimate of the
   structure's behavior and model parameters without the need of
   preliminary measurements for model updating.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Low-dose total skin electron beam therapy (TSEBT) over 3 weeks
   has proved to be a safe and effective treatment for cutaneous T cell
   lymphomas (CTCL). In this prospective trial, we examined the feasibility
   of ultra-hypofractionated low-dose TSEBT regimen in two fractions with 4
   Gy combined with systemic therapy to minimize the number of visits to
   radiation centers. Patients and methods Six patients with mycosis
   fungoides (MF) or Sezary syndrome (SS) received TSEBT with a total
   radiation dose of 8 Gy in two fractions between April 2020 and June
   2020. Patient and treatment characteristics, tumor burden, the impact on
   the quality of life using Skindex-29 questionnaires, and acute
   toxicities were analyzed. Results During TSEBT, all patients developed
   grade 1 toxicities while two patients developed grade 2 toxicities. One
   patient experienced sepsis. The most common adverse effects were
   erythema and edema. All grade 2 toxicities regressed after 4 weeks
   following TSEBT. Based on the reported symptoms measured by Skindex-29,
   we detected a significant reduction in total Skindex-29 score after 8
   weeks of radiation (P = 0.03), particularly in the symptoms (P = 0.01)
   and emotional domains (P = 0.04). Conclusion Ultra-hypofractionated
   low-dose TSEBT followed by systemic therapy seems to be a safe and
   feasible alternative to conventional fractionated TSEBT for patients
   with MF/SS. The skin tumor burden and the health-related quality of life
   have been significantly improved within 8 weeks following radiotherapy.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION MANAGEMENT}},
Abstract = {{Poor project performance in Malaysian construction industry resulting
   from poor cost management, time overrun, and inadequate quality has
   encouraged scholars to investigate the feasibility, suitability, and
   acceptability of lean principles in the construction sector. The purpose
   of this study was to assess the appropriateness and acceptability of
   lean principles by construction companies based in Pahang, Malaysia.
   This study applied quantitative methods and a simple random sampling
   technique to select 104 respondents from construction companies located
   in Pahang, Malaysia. The data were analyzed using partial least squares
   structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Results show that three
   variables in lean principles, namely operation in the flow of waste
   management, employee involvement in the flow of waste management, and
   continuous flow of waste management, support construction project
   performance. Conversely, information about flow in waste management
   negatively influences project performance. The findings from this study

Title = {{Highly efficient unidirectional forward scattering induced by resonant

Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{43}},
Pages = {{22289-22297}},
Month = {{NOV 21}},
Abstract = {{We demonstrate that a metal-dielectric heterodimer structure can satisfy
   a nearly ideal first Kerker condition at a wavelength close to the
   resonance peak of the dimer, yielding efficient unidirectional forward
   scattering with a high forward-to-backward scattering ratio (approximate
   to 48 dB) and remarkable enhancement of the forward scattering intensity
   (similar to 2.68 times compared to a single dielectric nanoparticle).
   Using a rigorous analytical dipole-dipole interaction model, the
   underlying mechanism is revealed, in which the originally weak electric
   dipole moment of the dimer is significantly enhanced owing to the strong
   resonant interference between the localized surface plasmon resonance of
   the metal and the Mie resonances of the dielectric material, which could
   up-match the magnetic dipole moment of the dimer at a wavelength close
   to the resonance peak, boosting the forward scattering efficiency. To
   achieve the optimal conditions, the sizes of the metal and dielectric
   constituents as well as the gap distance of the dimer have to be
   physically and delicately tuned to ensure a perfect match in both the
   amplitudes and phases of the electric and magnetic dipole moments of the
   dimer. On top of that, the loss of the heterodimer can be effectively
   suppressed to a level well below that of a pure metal nanoparticle,
   which further benefits the forward scattering efficiency. The
   flexibility in designing the dimer geometry and choosing
   metal-dielectric material combinations enables efficient unidirectional
   forward scattering in a broadband spectrum (UV to visible) with an
   intermediate gap distance (10-20 nm), greatly expanding the application
   scope. The proposed hybrid dimer could serve as a powerful and versatile
   building block in many emergent fields such as metasurfaces,
   nanoantennae, etc.}},

Abstract = {{A guided-ion beam tandem mass spectrometric study was performed on
   collision-induced dissociation (CID) of a protonated
   9-methylguanine-1-methylcytosine Watson-Crick base pair (designated as
   WC-{[}9MG center dot 1MC + H](+)), from which dissociation pathways and
   dissociation energies were determined. Electronic structure calculations
   at the DFT, RI-MP2 and DLPNO-CCSD(T) levels of theory were used to
   identify product structures and delineate reaction mechanisms.
   Intra-base-pair proton transfer (PT) of WC-{[}9MG center dot 1MC + H](+)
   results in conventional base-pair conformations that consist of
   hydrogen-bonded {[}9MG + H](+) and 1MC and proton-transferred
   conformations that are formed by PT from the N1 of {[}9MG + H](+) to the
   N3 ` of 1MC. Two types of conformers were distinguished by CID in which
   the conventional conformers produced {[}9MG + H](+) product ions whereas
   the proton-transferred conformers produced {[}1MC + H](+). The
   conventional conformers have a higher population (99.8\%) and lower
   dissociation energy than the proton-transferred counterparts. However,
   in contrast to what was expected from the statistical dissociation of
   the equilibrium base-pair conformational ensemble, the CID product ions
   of WC-{[}9MG center dot 1MC + H](+) were dominated by {[}1MC + H](+)
   rather than {[}9MG + H](+). This finding, alongside the non-statistical
   CID reported for deprotonated guanine-cytosine (Lu et al.; PCCP, 2016,
   18, 32222) and guanine-cytosine radical cation (Sun et al.; PCCP, 2020,
   22, 14875), reinforces that non-statistical dissociation is a
   distinctive feature of singly-charged Watson-Crick guanine-cytosine base
   pairs. It implies that intra-base-pair PT facilitates the formation of
   proton-transferred conformers in these systems and the ensuing
   conformers have loose transition states for dissociation. The
   monohydrate of WC-{[}9MG center dot 1MC + H](+) preserves
   non-statistical CID kinetics and introduces collision-induced methanol
   elimination via the reaction of the water ligand with a methyl group.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{65}},

Month = {{NOV 21}},
Abstract = {{In contrast to conventional radiotherapy, spatiotemporal fractionation
   (STF) delivers a distinct dose distribution in each fraction. The aim is
   to increase the therapeutic window by simultaneously achieving partial
   hypofractionation in the tumour along with near uniform fractionation in
   normal tissues. STF has been studied in silico under the assumption that
   different parts of the tumour can be treated in different fractions.
   Here, we develop an experimental setup for testing this key assumption
   on the preclinical level using high-precision partial tumour irradiation
   in an experimental animal model. We further report on an initial
   proof-of-concept experiment. We consider a reductionist model of STF in
   which the tumour is divided in half and treated with two complementary
   partial irradiations separated by 24 h. Precise irradiation of both
   tumour halves is facilitated by the image-guided small animal radiation
   research platform X-RAD SmART. To assess the response of tumours to
   partial irradiations, tumour growth experiments are conducted using mice
   carrying syngeneic subcutaneous tumours derived from MC38 colorectal
   adenocarcinoma cells. Tumour volumes were determined daily by calliper
   measurements and validated by CT-volumetry. We compared the growth of
   conventionally treated tumours, where the whole tumour was treated in
   one fraction, to the reductionist model of STF. We observed no
   difference in growth between the two groups. Instead, a reduction in the
   irradiated volume (where only one half of the tumour was irradiated)
   resulted in an intermediate response between full irradiation and
   unirradiated control. The results obtained by CT-volumetry supported the
   findings of the calliper-derived measurements. An experimental setup for
   precise partial tumour irradiation in small animals was developed, which
   is suited to test the assumption of STF that complementary parts of the
   tumour can be treated in different fractions on the preclinical level.
   An initial experiment supports this assumption, however, further
   experiments with longer follow-up and varying fractionation schemes are
   needed to provide additional support for STF.}},

Abstract = {{Two series of lanthanide-based metal-organic frameworks, namely
   \{{[}Ln(BIPA-TC)(0.5)(DMA)(2)(NO3)]center dot DMA center dot H2O\}(n)
   (1-Ln, Ln = Eu, Dy, Sm, Nd) and
   \{{[}Ln(2)(BIPA-TC)(1.5)(DMA)(3)(H2O)(2)]center dot 2DMA center dot
   2H(2)O\}(n) (2-Ln, Ln = Eu, Dy, Sm, Nd), were successfully constructed
   via a solvent regulation strategy based on a pi-electron rich
   tetra-carboxylate ligand (H(4)BIPA-TC). 1-Ln shows a 4-connected lvt
   topology with the point symbol of \{4(2)center dot 8(4)\}, but 2-Ln
   displays a new 4,4,6-connected wxk1 topology with the point symbol of
   \{4(3)center dot 8(3)\}(4)\{4(6)center dot 6(6)center dot
   8(3)\}(2)\{8(6)\}. The solid-state luminescence property and the
   microporous nature of Eu-MOFs (1-Eu and 2-Eu) indicate that they can
   potentially be used as luminescent sensors. Fluorescence measurements
   indicate that Fe3+ exhibits the quenching effect for 1-Eu with the
   quenching efficiency of 93.1\%. 2-Eu is the first MOF sensor for Mg2+
   with the lowest detection limit of 1.53 x 10(-10) mol L-1 and displays
   good recyclable capability. Simultaneously, in the presence of other
   metal ions (Ca2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Pd2+, Al3+,
   Cr(3+)and Fe3+), 2-Eu can maintain the selective sensing of Mg2+,
   indicating its potential for Mg2+ turn-on sensing.}},

Abstract = {{Background Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are a type
   of soft tissue sarcomas (STS) with recurrence and metastatic potential.
   We aimed to investigate the risk factors for developing distant
   metastases (DM) and to identify the prognostic factors in patients with
   DM. Methods Based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result
   (SEER) database, MPNST patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2016 were
   extracted in our study. The logistic regression model was performed for
   predicting DM development while the Cox proportional hazard regression
   model was conducted for revealing the prognostic factors. Results
   Eventually, 764 patients diagnosed with MPNSTs were included with 109
   cases presenting with metastases at initial diagnosis. Larger tumor size
   and lymph node metastases were independent risk factors for developing
   DM. The median overall survival (OS) for patients with metastases was
   8.0 (95\% CI: 6.1-9.9) months. Multiple metastatic sites and no surgical
   treatment were prognostic factors for worse survival. Tumors located in
   non-head and neck region were related with better survival. Conclusions
   The incidence of DM was 14.3\% with a dismal median OS of 8.0 months for
   metastatic MPNSTs. More evaluation should be applied for patients with
   large tumor size and lymph metastases. Tumors located in head and neck
   region and the presence of multiple metastases predicted worse survival
   outcome. Surgical treatment can significantly improve the survival of
   MPNST patients with distant metastasis.}},

Abstract = {{Mono-, di- and triacetin are three glycerol esters which are usually
   synthesized via costly and environmentally unfriendly chemical synthesis
   methods. Here, Escherichia coli is metabolically engineered for the
   production of mono-, di- and triacetin using glycerol as a substrate.
   First, a novel biosynthetic route of mono- and diacetin is established
   by overexpression of a native enzyme, maltose O-acetyltransferase (MAA).
   Next, the biosynthetic pathway is extended to produce a mixture of
   mono-, di- and triacetin by overexpression of
   chloramphenicol-O-acetyltransferase (CAT). By successive strategies,
   including heterologous gene expression, metabolic engineering, and
   culture optimization, a recombinant E. coli is enabled to produce more
   than 27 g L-1 of a mixture of mono-, di- and triacetin in shake flask
   cultures, which is a >650-fold increase over the initial production of
   0.04 g L-1. In vitro studies confirm the acetylation of glycerol to
   mono- and diacetin by MAA, and the additional acetylation to triacetin
   by CAT. When crude glycerol is used as a substrate, the engineered
   strain produced a total of 25.9 g L-1 of the acetin mixture, about the
   same as that achieved from pure glycerol. To our knowledge, this is the
   first successful report of microbial production of the artificial
   chemicals, acetins.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer electrolytes are recognized as the optimal solution to resolve
   the bottlenecks of liquid electrolytes such as safety hazards,
   decomposition and sodium dendrite problems. Herein, a novel
   multifunctional monomer which combines nonflammable spirocyclic
   pentaerythritol diphosphates and the easily polymerizable acrylates are
   designed and prepared, and the corresponding cross-linked gel copolymer
   electrolytes are synthesized by in situ polymerization with ethyl
   acrylate and trifluoroethyl methacrylate. The gel polymer electrolytes
   have good thermal stability, good interfacial compatibility, a high
   ionic conductivity of 3.26 x 10(-3) S cm(-1), a high ion transfer number
   of 0.604, and excellent electrochemical stability of up to 4.9 V (vs.
   Na+/Na), and thus could be used as possible less flammable electrolytes.
   The Na3V2(PO4)(3) cells using gel polymer electrolytes deliver better
   long term cycle stability than the corresponding liquid electrolyte,
   which retain 81.4\% and 69.5\% capacity after 1600 cycles, respectively.
   Moreover, the gel polymer electrolyte based Na3V2(PO4)(3) cell exhibits
   much higher capacity and superior cycle stability compared to the liquid
   cell when running at an elevated temperature of 60 degrees C.
   Furthermore, within the operating temperature, the gel polymer
   electrolyte cell has better reversibility of temperature adjustment. In
   addition, gel polymer electrolytes also exhibit good cycle performance
   with organic cathodes, holding great promise for the production of safer
   phosphate-containing cell systems.}},

Abstract = {{Wire breakages and spark absence are two typical machining failures that
   occur during wire electric discharge machining (wire-EDM), if
   appropriate parameter settings are not maintained. Even after several
   attempts to optimize the process, machining failures cannot be
   eliminated completely. An offline classification model is presented
   herein to predict machining failures. The aim of the current study is to
   develop a multiclass classification model using an artificial neural
   network (ANN). The training dataset comprises 81 full factorial
   experiments with three levels of pulse-on time, pulse-off time, servo
   voltage, and wire feed rate as input parameters. The classes are labeled
   as normal machining, spark absence, and wire breakage. The model
   accuracy is tested by conducting 20 confirmation experiments, and the
   model is discovered to be 95\% accurate in classifying the machining
   outcomes. The effects of process parameters on the process failures are
   discussed and analyzed. A microstructural analysis of the machined
   surface and worn wire surface is conducted. The developed model proved
   to be an easy and fast solution for verifying and eliminating process
   failures.}},

Abstract = {{Heteroaggregation corresponds to an attraction between two different
   types of particles. It can either lead to stable or instable systems,
   depending on the conditions. In this paper heteroaggregation in binary
   mixtures of alumina and silica colloids is studied, by coupling an
   experimental approach and Brownian dynamics simulations. Two main
   objectives are targeted. The first one is to bridge the gap between
   coagulation and dispersion, by examining the effect of the relative
   concentrations of silica and alumina. The second one is to study the
   effect of the volume fraction of solid, which impacts strongly the
   aggregation mechanism.
   The coagulation or the dispersion are evidenced by sedimentation tests,
   granulometry, and rheological measurements, supported by zeta potential
   measurements. Heteroaggregates could be observed by transmission
   electron microscopy. Brownian dynamics simulations give more insight
   into the very first moments of the process, to predict the adsorption
   kinetic and the heteroaggregates structure.
   A very good agreement is obtained between experiments and simulations,
   which both show adsorption of silica leads to the bridging of alumina
   particles and thus coagulation at low concentration. This adsorption is
   rapidly limited by electrostatic interactions, then hindering alumina
   agglomeration by repulsive interactions. For the higher solid fractions,
   alumina aggregation is more likely, as two alumina particles can easier
   encounter before their surface is enough covered by the silica to avoid
   their aggregation.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate a kilohertz frame rate snapshot hyperspectral imaging
   system suitable for high-speed imaging, which we name snapshot
   hyperspectral imager for emission and reactions (SHEAR). This system
   splits the sensor of a single high-speed camera to simultaneously
   capture a conventional image and a spectrally sheared response of the
   scene under study. Given the small, point-source-like nature of burning
   metal micro-particles, the spectral response of the species is captured
   without the need for a slit, as is needed in conventional imaging
   spectrometers. We pair robust image registration techniques with sparse
   reconstruction algorithms to computationally disentangle overlapping
   spectra associated with many burning partides over the course of a
   combustion experiment. As a proof-of-concept experiment, representative
   physical vapor deposited Al:Zr composite particles are ignited, and
   their burn evolution is recorded at a frame rate of 2 kHz using this
   method. We demonstrate operation over two distinct wavelength ranges
   spanning hundreds of nanometers in wavelength and with sub-nanometer
   resolution. We are able to track hundreds of individual Al:Zr particles
   in a single high-speed video, providing ample statistics of burn time,
   temperature, and A10 emission timing in a high-throughput method. The
   demonstrated technology is high-throughput, flexible in wavelength,
   inexpensive, and relatively easy to implement, and provides a much
   needed tool for in situ composite metal fuel diagnostics. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{The drivers and patterns of zoonotic virus emergence in the human
   population are poorly understood. The mosquito Aedes aegypti is a major
   arbovirus vector native to Africa that invaded most of the world's
   tropical belt over the past four centuries, after the evolution of a
   ``domestic{''} form that specialized in biting humans and breeding in
   water storage containers. Here, we show that human specialization and
   subsequent spread of A. aegypti out of Africa were accompanied by an
   increase in its intrinsic ability to acquire and transmit the emerging
   human pathogen Zika virus. Thus, the recent evolution and global
   expansion of A. aegypti promoted arbovirus emergence not solely through
   increased vector-host contact but also as a result of enhanced vector
   susceptibility.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{This work involved the utilization of a byproduct from the palm oil
   refining process as reaction feedstock in a solventless and
   hydrogen-free catalytic deoxygenation (DO) over NiO-ZnO catalyst in
   producing diesel-like hydrocarbons as advanced biofuels. The catalyst
   supporter was synthesized using coprecipitation methods to form highly
   crystalline meso-macrostructured ZnO particles. The catalyst support was
   wet-impregnated with different loadings (wt \%) of NiO to prepare the
   NiO-ZnO catalyst. X-ray diffraction patterns verified the persistence of
   good crystallinity and phase purity of the support, with fine NiO
   crystallites of size 14-22 nm. Synthesized NiO-ZnO catalysts
   demonstrated Type IV isotherm with H3 hysteresis loop with
   mesoporous-macroporous properties. The Bronsted and Lewis acidic sites
   of Ni-ZnO offer a synergy effect between the active site and catalyst
   supporter. Both N-2 adsorption isotherm and electron microscopy analysis
   revealed the increase of the crystallite size of the catalyst by
   increase the NiO loadings. The catalytic activity of the NiO-ZnO
   catalyst was tested in a semi-batch reactor at 350 degrees C for 2 h in
   N-2 atmospheric. The oxygenated compounds of palm fatty acid distillate
   (PFAD) have been successfully removed to form linear hydrocarbons as
   green diesel compounds. The synergistic effect between NiO and ZnO
   significantly enhanced the catalytic activity for substrate DO. The
   hydrocarbons product yield reached 83.4\%, with a diesel range
   (C-11-C-17) selectivity of 86.0\%. The green diesel, which contains

Title = {{Correlating arterial blood gas, acid-base and blood pressure
   abnormalities with outcomes in COVID-19 intensive care patients}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF CLINICAL BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{58}},

Abstract = {{Background
   During the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many studies
   have investigated laboratory biomarkers in management and
   prognostication of COVID-19 patients, however to date, few have
   investigated arterial blood gas, acid-base and blood pressure patterns.
   The aim of the study is to assess the arterial blood gas and acid-base
   patterns, blood pressure findings and their association with the
   outcomes of COVID-19 patients admitted to an intensive care unit.
   Methods
   A single-centre retrospective, observational study in a dedicated
   COVID-19 intensive care unit in Cape Town, South Africa. Admission
   arterial blood gas, serum electrolytes, renal function and blood
   pressure readings performed on COVID-19 patients admitted between 26
   March and 2 June 2020 were analysed and compared between survivors and
   non-survivors.
   Results
   A total of 56 intensive care unit patients had admission arterial blood
   gas performed at the time of intensive care unit admission. An
   alkalaemia (pH > 7.45) was observed in 36 (64.3\%) patients. A higher
   arterial pH (median 7.48 {[}interquartile range: 7.45-7.51] versus 7.46
   {[}interquartile range: 7.40-7.48], P = 0.049) and partial pressure of
   oxygen in arterial blood (median 7.9 kPa {[}interquartile range:
   7.3-9.6] versus 6.5 kPa {[}interquartile range: 5.2-7.3], P = <0.001)
   were significantly associated with survival. Survivors also tended to
   have a higher systolic blood pressure (median: 144 mmHg {[}interquartile
   range: 134-152] versus 139 mmHg {[}interquartile range: 125-142], P =
   0.078) and higher arterial HCO3 (median: 28.0 mmol/L {[}interquartile
   range: 25.7-28.8] versus 26.3 mmol/L {[}interquartile range: 24.3-27.9],
   P = 0.059).
   Conclusions
   The majority of the study population admitted to intensive care unit had
   an alkalaemia on arterial blood gas. A higher pH and lower partial
   pressure of oxygen in arterial blood on arterial blood gas analysis were
   significantly associated with survival.}},

Title = {{Studies on efficacy of biocementation of cement mortar using soil
   extract}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{274}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Haphazard increase in population has resulted in an enormous increase in
   construction demands. Huge amounts of resources are utilized for these
   gigantic constructions. Thus, chemical and non-biodegradable additives
   are over consumed in order to strengthen and protect these
   constructions. Such practices adversely affect the environment and thus
   the production of environment-friendly strength improve-ment materials
   is of utmost importance to achieve sustainability goals. Biocementation
   is one of the most emphasized green practices, which uses bacterial
   metabolisms to produce calcium carbonate mineral that has extraordinary
   ability to strengthen, heal and protect construction materials. In spite
   of having pronounced potential to improve and repair construction
   materials, biocementation has some drawbacks from practicability point
   of view. The cost and maintenance of nutrients required for the growth
   of microorganisms are the factors that limit practicability of
   biocementation. Present study focuses on replacement of expensive
   nutrients by rhizospheric soil extract for the growth of ureolytic
   bacteria, and to use them to boost the mechanical properties of
   cement-mortar by microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation
   (MICCP) or biocementation. Results showed that the soil extract was as
   effective as conventional growth nutrients to grow the ureolytic
   bacteria which can be used for the process of biocementation to
   strengthen the construction materials. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Arabidopsis KASH Proteins SINE1 and SINE2 Are Involved in Microtubule
   Reorganization During ABA-Induced Stomatal Closure}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Abscisic acid (ABA) induces stomatal closure by utilizing complex
   signaling mechanisms, allowing for sessile plants to respond rapidly to
   ever-changing environmental conditions. ABA regulates the activity of
   plasma membrane ion channels and calcium-dependent protein kinases, Ca2+
   oscillations, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentrations.
   Throughout ABA-induced stomatal closure, the cytoskeleton undergoes
   dramatic changes that appear important for efficient closure. However,
   the precise role of this cytoskeletal reorganization in stomatal closure
   and the nature of its regulation are unknown. We have recently shown
   that the plant KASH proteins SINE1 and SINE2 are connected to actin
   organization during ABA-induced stomatal closure but their role in
   microtubule (MT) organization remains to be investigated. We show here
   that depolymerizing MTs using oryzalin can restore ABA-induced stomatal
   closure deficits in sine1-1 and sine2-1 mutants. GFP-MAP4-visualized MT
   organization is compromised in sine1-1 and sine2-1 mutants during
   ABA-induced stomatal closure. Loss of SINE1 or SINE2 results in loss of
   radially organized MT patterning in open guard cells, aberrant MT
   organization during stomatal closure, and an overall decrease in the
   number of MT filaments or bundles. Thus, SINE1 and SINE2 are necessary
   for establishing MT patterning and mediating changes in MT
   rearrangement, which is required for ABA-induced stomatal closure.}},

Abstract = {{Regulatory elements (REs) consist of enhancers and promoters that occupy
   a significant portion of the noncoding genome and control gene
   expression programs either in cis or in trans. Putative REs have been
   identified largely based on their regulatory features (co-occupancy of
   ESC-specific transcription factors, enhancer histone marks, and DNase
   hypersensitivity) in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). However, less
   has been established regarding their regulatory functions in their
   native context. We deployed cis- and trans-regulatory elements scanning
   through saturating mutagenesis and sequencing (ctSCAN-SMS) to target
   elements within the similar to 12-kb cis-region (cis-REs; CREs) of the
   Oct4 gene locus, as well as genome-wide 2,613 high-confidence trans-REs
   (TREs), in mESCs. ctSCAN-SMS identified 10 CREs and 12 TREs as novel
   candidate REs of the Oct4 gene in mESCs. Furthermore, deletions of these
   candidate REs confirmed that the majority of the REs are functionally
   active, and CREs are more active than TREs in controlling Oct4 gene
   expression. A subset of active CREs and TREs physically interact with
   the Oct4 promoter to varying degrees; specifically, a greater number of
   active CREs, compared with active TREs, physically interact with the
   Oct4 promoter. Moreover, comparative genomics analysis reveals that a
   greater number of active CREs than active TREs are evolutionarily
   conserved between mice and primates, including humans. Taken together,
   our study demonstrates the reliability and robustness of ctSCAN-SMS
   screening to identify critical REs and investigate their roles in the
   regulation of transcriptional output of a target gene (in this case
   Oct4) in their native context.}},

   miR-29c-3p and miR-133a-3p are dysregulated in DMD subjects.
   Free-circulating and EV-derived miR-29c-3p are reduced in DMD subjects
   undergoing daily corticosteroid treatment. Free-circulating miR-1-3p and
   miR-122-5p are longitudinally upregulated in ambulant DMD subjects.
   Conclusion: We detected novel free-circulating and EV-derived
   dysregulated miRNAs in plasma from DMD subjects and characterized the
   longitudinal profile of free-circulating miRNA on plasma from DMD
   subjects.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the post-release activity of newly tagged fish and determined
   whether and for how long experimental protocol impacted their behavior.
   Our study focused on three species (Plectropomus leopardus, Chlorurus
   microrhinos and Scarus ghobban), including a total of 30 fish. Fish were
   kept outside their natural environment for several days before release
   for pre- and post-tagging surveys. Moreover, 47\% of them were not
   released at their capture site. Half of all individuals (all species)
   showed a high level of side fidelity immediately upon release. During
   this period, they were detected in the same place, by a small and
   constant number of hydrophones. This site fidelity pattern was also
   observed for the other fish (50\%; all species) but after 1 to 18 days
   of an unsettled pattern, during which the fish moved significantly along
   the reef slope (high activity). During this short period, the distances
   travelled were significantly higher than during the subsequent period of
   site fidelity (several km vs. a few hundred m). We hypothesize that
   these unsettled patterns might result from fish experimental
   displacement (homing behavior) and from post-capture captivity (the fish
   had to recover a niche within the ecosystem). Consequently, we suggest
   that fish be released where they were caught to limit the movements
   associated with homing behavior. Periods of captivity should be avoided
   as much as possible. If this is not possible, a minimum acclimatization
   period of two or three weeks should be taken into account when analyzing
   the data.}},

Title = {{Long Non-coding RNA Expression Profiling Identifies a Four-Long
   Non-coding RNA Prognostic Signature for Isocitrate Dehydrogenase Mutant
   Glioma}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant is one of the most
   robust and important genetic aberrations in glioma. However, the
   underlying regulation mechanism of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in IDH
   mutant glioma has not been systematically portrayed.
   Methods:In this work, 775 IDH mutant glioma samples with transcriptome
   data, including 167 samples from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA)
   RNAseq dataset, 390 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset,
   79 samples from GSE16011 dataset, and 139 samples from CGGA microarray
   dataset, were enrolled. R language and GraphPad Prism software were
   applied for the statistical analysis and graphical work.
   Results: By comparing the differentially lncRNA genes between IDH mutant
   and IDH wild-type glioma samples, a four-lncRNA (JAG1, PVT1, H19, and
   HAR1A) signature was identified in IDH mutant glioma patients. The
   signature model was established based on the expression level and the
   regression coefficient of the four lncRNA genes. IDH mutant glioma
   samples could be successfully stratified into low-risk and high-risk
   groups in CGGA RNAseq, TCGA, GSE16011, and CGGA microarray databases.
   Meanwhile, multivariate Cox analysis showed that the four-lncRNA
   signature was an independent prognostic biomarker after adjusting for
   other clinicopathologic factors. Moreover, the Gene Ontology (GO) and
   Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses revealed that
   the immune response and cellular metabolism were significantly
   associated with the four-lncRNA risk signature.
   Conclusion: Taken together, the four-lncRNA risk signature was
   identified as a novel prognostic marker for IDH mutant glioma patients
   and may potentially lead to improvements in the lives of glioma
   patients.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Feelings of ownership play an important role in experiential
   education and are associated with several positive outcomes. However,
   researchers have yet to explore the dynamic nature of psychological
   ownership and its antecedents in experiential courses from the
   perspectives of the students. Purpose: The authors used the lens of
   psychological ownership theory to explore the experiences of students in
   an experiential learning setting. Methodology/Approach: In this study,
   the authors used repeated waves of semi-structured interviews in a
   two-semester classroom-as-organization (CAO). They then used a five-step
   process to identify themes describing the students' experience.
   Findings/Conclusions: The authors found that different antecedents to
   psychological ownership worked together at different points in the
   development of the CAO, that students did not want full control of the
   CAO (despite their feelings of ownership toward it), and that students
   anticipated feelings of ownership that persisted after the class had
   ended. Implications: Educators may struggle to identify the level of
   control students' need in a CAO to reap the benefits of the experience.
   Persistent feelings of ownership after experiential learning ends can
   contribute to student development.}},

Abstract = {{Two-year-old interior Douglas-fir seedlings in a greenhouse were
   artificially inoculated with Coniferiporia sulphurascens and grown for
   four years. The study population included 2,261 seedlings from 94
   half-sibling families distributed across four breeding zones. There was
   little mortality over the 4 years, but there was advanced stain
   internally at the root collar from infection by the fungus indicating
   host resistance/susceptibility. The breeding zones had no effect on
   stain incidence. The tallest trees had more staining, differing up to
   30\% incidence over the size range, and the families had at most +/- 6\%
   incidence in stain from the average. Disease tolerance, assessed by
   height growth relative to controls, was affected by zone and family. The
   tallest families were the least tolerant, by at most 5\% less than
   control tree height. There was little association between tolerance and
   resistance at the family level, meaning that both disease response
   mechanisms were likely separate. The most common response strategy at
   the family level was to combine higher resistance and tolerance, being
   about twice as common as lower resistance and tolerance trait
   combinations. Interior isolates of the fungus may have lower virulence
   than coastal isolates, which might help to explain the low genetic
   response to the fungus. Inoculum reduction versus tree breeding may be a
   better strategy for control of the disease for interior Douglas-fir.}},

Title = {{Implementing Mobile Health-Enabled Integrated Care for Complex Chronic
   Patients: Patients and Professionals' Acceptability Study}},
Journal = {{JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Integrated care (IC) can promote health and social care
   efficiency through prioritization of preventive patient-centered models
   and defragmentation of care and collaboration across health tiers, and
   mobile health (mHealth) can be the cornerstone allowing for the adoption
   of IC.
   Objective: This study aims to assess the acceptability, usability, and
   satisfaction of an mHealth-enabled IC model for complex chronic patients
   in both patients and health professionals.
   Methods: As part of the CONNECARE Horizon 2020 project, a prospective,
   pragmatic, 2-arm, parallel, hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial
   was conducted from July 2018 to August 2019 in a rural region of
   Catalonia, Spain. Home-dwelling patients 55 years and older with chronic
   conditions and a history of hospitalizations for chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease or heart failure (use case {[}UC] 1), or a scheduled
   major elective hip or knee arthroplasty (UC2) were recruited. During the
   3 months, patients experienced an mHealth-enabled IC model, including a
   self-management app for patients, a set of integrated sensors, and a
   web-based platform connecting professionals from different settings or
   usual care. The Person-Centered Coordinated Care Experience
   Questionnaire (P3CEQ) and the Nijmegen Continuity Questionnaire (NCQ)
   assessed person-centeredness and continuity of care. Acceptability was
   assessed for IC arm patients and staff with the Net Promoter Score (NPS)
   and the System Usability Scale (SUS).
   Results: The analyses included 77 IC patients, 58 controls who completed
   the follow-up, and 30 health care professionals. The mean age was 78 (SD
   9) years in both study arms. Perception of patient-centeredness was
   similarly high in both arms (usual care: mean P3CEQ score 16.1, SD 3.3;
   IC: mean P3CEQ score 16.3, SD 2.4). IC patients reported better
   continuity of care than controls (usual care: mean NCQ score 3.7, SD
   0.9; IC: mean NCQ score 4.0, SD 1; P=.04). The scores for patient
   acceptability (UC1: NPS +67\%; UC2: NPS +45\%) and usability (UC1: mean
   SUS score 79, SD 14; UC2: mean SUS score 68, SD 24) were outstanding.
   Professionals' acceptability was low (UC1: NPS -25\%; UC2: NPS -35\%),
   whereas usability was average (UC1: mean SUS score 63, SD 20; UC2: mean
   SUS score 62, SD 19). The actual use of technology was high; 77\%
   (58/75) of patients reported physical activity for at least 60 days, and
   the ratio of times reported over times prescribed for other sensors
   ranged from 37\% for oxygen saturation to 67\% for weight.
   Conclusions: The mHealth-enabled IC model showed outstanding results
   from the patients' perspective in 2 different UCs but lacked maturity
   and integration with legacy systems to be fully accepted by
   professionals. This paper provides useful lessons learned through the
   development and assessment process and may be of use to organizations
   willing to develop or implement mHealth-enabled IC for older adults.}},

   using Selectfluor as the oxidant was developed that converts unactivated
   anilines into 3H-indoles is reported herein. The reaction requires as
   little as 1 mol \% of the iodocatalyst and is mild, tolerating pyridine
   and thiophene functional groups, and the dependence of the

   perceived to be the benefits and drawbacks of using multimodal learning
   objects (LO) as learners, active classroom debate leaders and
   pre-service teachers of English in contexts of inverted classroom
   instruction. The results showed that LO were perceived as an excellent
   tool in inverted settings of instruction as they enabled a shift in the
   classroom dynamics towards a learner-centred approach. No significant
   differences were found among the views of students, debate leaders, and
   pre-service teachers. However, pre-service teachers expressed concerns
   about implementing LO. This suggests that more importance should be
   given to support their use in the English classroom.}},

   resources were functional in moderating the associations between demands
   and intention to leave: social support, vertical trust, and humanity
   moderated work pace and workflow moderated emotional demands. For
   assistant nurses, organizational clarity and interprofessional

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Orientation: Higher education institutions are under pressure to address
   the challenge of the leadership pipeline. Therefore, the need exists to
   explore the potential of current leaders and their views of leadership
   in higher education.
   Research purpose: The study aimed to explore the views of how academic
   and professional support leaders have shifted their thinking of and
   approach to leadership following their participation in a leadership
   development programme.
   Motivation for the study: Understanding the views of potential leaders
   about leadership and how leadership development programmes can influence
   their thinking is essential.
   Research approach/design and method: Qualitative data was gathered by
   means of a document analysis using reflections submitted by 19
   participants of a leadership development programme.
   Main Findings: The results showed that the programme had an impact on
   how participants started reflecting on leadership styles beyond the
   usual description of leadership styles. Additionally, participants used
   the opportunity for introspection of their own role as a leader and how
   they need to adapt.
   Practical/managerial implications: Higher education institutions are
   encouraged to implement leadership development programmes that will
   encourage stakeholders to engage in introspective activities that could
   influence behavioural change.
   Contribution/value-add: It is evident from the results that the
   information is useful in indicating how participants had made personal
   adjustments in the way they viewed leadership with a greater sense of
   ownership and understanding of distributed leadership through the
   participation in a leadership development programme.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN GERIATRICS SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{69}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{932-937}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background/Objectives Advance care planning (ACP) traditionally involves
   asking individuals about their treatment preferences during a brief
   period of incapacity near the end of life. Because dementia leads to
   prolonged incapacity, with many decisions arising before a terminal
   event, it has been suggested that dementia-specific ACP is necessary. We
   sought to elicit the perspectives of older adults with early cognitive
   impairment and their caregivers on traditional and dementia-specific
   ACP.
   Design Qualitative study with separate focus groups for patients and
   caregivers.
   Setting Memory disorder clinics.
   Participants Twenty eight persons aged 65+ with mild cognitive
   impairment or early dementia and 19 caregivers.
   Measurements Understanding of dementia trajectory and types of planning
   done; how medical decisions would be made in the future; thoughts about
   these decisions.
   Results No participants had engaged in any written form of
   dementia-specific planning. Barriers to dementia-specific ACP emerged,
   including lack of knowledge about the expected trajectory of dementia
   and potential medical decisions, the need to stay focused in the present
   because of fear of loss of self, disinterest in planning because the
   patient will not be aware of decisions, and the expectation that
   involved family members would take care of issues. Some patients had
   trouble engaging in the discussion. Patients had highly variable views
   on what the quality of their future life would be and on the leeway
   their surrogates should have in decision making.
   Conclusions Even among patients with early cognitive impairment seen in
   specialty clinics and their caregivers, most were unaware of the
   decisions they could face, and there were many barriers to planning for
   these decisions. These issues would likely be magnified in more
   representative populations, and highlight challenges to the use of
   dementia-specific advance directive documents.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous paleoecological questions concern the mobility of ancient fauna
   in eastern Beringia. Strontium (Sr) isotope ratio (Sr-87/Sr-86) analysis
   has emerged as a powerful tracer for determining the provenance of
   ancient biological materials. However, it is important to characterize
   Sr-87/Sr-86 variation across a landscape. We measured the Sr-87/Sr-86
   composition of teeth from present-day, herbivorous rodents (n = 162)
   sampled from across eastern Beringia to estimate bio-available
   Sr-87/Sr-86 values. We compiled these data with the very limited number
   of previously published Sr-87/Sr-86 values from the region. We then used
   this dataset and a machine learning, random-forest regression to predict
   bio-available Sr-87/Sr-86 variations across eastern Beringia. As a case
   study using our new Sr-87/Sr-86 map (isoscape), we measured the
   Sr-87/Sr-86 and oxygen stable isotope values (delta O-18) of five
   radiocarbon-dated steppe bison from eastern Beringia and compared these
   to our Sr-87/Sr-86 isoscape and a delta O-18 isoscape to estimate the
   probable landscape use of these ancient fauna. Our model and isoscape
   provide important foundations for a wide range of additional
   applications, including studies of the paleo-mobility of other fauna,
   ancient people and present-day fauna in eastern Beringia.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a fully self-consistent subtracted second random-phase
   approximation for charge-exchange processes with Skyrme energy-density
   functionals. As a first application, we study Gamow-Teller excitations
   in the doubly magic nucleus Ca-48, the lightest double-beta emitter that
   could be used in an experiment, and in Ni-78, the single-beta-decay rate
   of which is known. The amount of Gamow-Teller strength below 20 or 30
   MeV is considerably smaller than in other energy-density-functional
   calculations and agrees better with experiment in Ca-48, as does the
   beta-decay rate in Ni-78. These important results, obtained without ad
   hoc quenching factors, are due to the presence of two-particle-two-hole
   configurations. Their density progressively increases with excitation
   energy, leading to a long high-energy tail in the spectrum, a fact that
   may have implications for the computation of nuclear matrix elements for
   neutrinoless double-beta decay in the same framework.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Programmed death-1 (PD-1) is an immunoinhibitory receptor expressed on
   lymphocytes. Interaction of PD-1 with its ligand PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1)
   delivers inhibitory signals and impairs proliferation, cytokine
   production, and cytotoxicity of T cells. In our previous studies, we
   have developed anti-bovine PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and
   reported that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway was closely associated with T-cell
   exhaustion and disease progression in bovine chronic infections and
   canine tumors. Furthermore, we found that blocking antibodies that
   target PD-1 and PD-L1 restore T-cell functions and could be used in
   immunotherapy in cattle and dogs. However, the immunological role of the
   PD-1/PD-L1 pathway for chronic equine diseases, including tumors,
   remains unclear. In this study, we identified cDNA sequences of equine
   PD-1 (EqPD-1) and PD-L1 (EqPD-L1) and investigated the role of
   anti-bovine PD-L1 mAbs against EqPD-L1 using in vitro assays. In
   addition, we evaluated the expression of PD-L1 in tumor tissues of
   equine malignant melanoma (EMM). The amino acid sequences of EqPD-1 and
   EqPD-L1 share a considerable identity and similarity with homologs from
   non-primate species. Two clones of the anti-bovine PD-L1 mAbs recognized
   EqPD-L1 in flow cytometry, and one of these cross-reactive mAbs blocked
   the binding of equine PD-1/PD-L1. Of note, immunohistochemistry
   confirmed the PD-L1 expression in EMM tumor tissues. A cultivation assay
   revealed that PD-L1 blockade enhanced the production of Th1 cytokines in
   equine immune cells. These findings showed that our anti-PD-L1 mAbs
   would be useful for analyzing the equine PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. Further
   research is warranted to discover the immunological role of PD-1/PD-L1
   in chronic equine diseases and elucidate a future application in
   immunotherapy for horses.}},

Title = {{A Data Mining Method Using Deep Learning for Anomaly Detection in Cloud
   Computing Environment}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Aiming at problems such as slow training speed, poor prediction effect,
   and unstable detection results of traditional anomaly detection
   algorithms, a data mining method for anomaly detection based on the deep
   variational dimensionality reduction model and MapReduce (DMAD-DVDMR) in
   cloud computing environment is proposed. First of all, the data are
   preprocessed by a dimensionality reduction model based on deep
   variational learning and based on ensuring complete data information as
   much as possible, the dimensionality of the data is reduced, and the
   computational pressure is reduced. Secondly, the data set stored on the
   Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is logically divided into several
   data blocks, and the data blocks are processed in parallel through the
   principle of MapReduce, so the k-distance and LOF value of each data
   point can only be calculated in each block. Thirdly, based on stochastic
   gradient descent, the concept of k-neighboring distance is redefined,
   thus avoiding the situation where there are greater than or equal to
   k-repeated points and infinite local density in the data set. Finally,
   compared with CNN, DeepAnt, and SVM-IDS algorithms, the accuracy of the
   scheme is increased by 10.3\%, 18.0\%, and 17.2\%, respectively. The
   experimental data set verifies the effectiveness and scalability of the
   proposed DMAD-DVDMR algorithm.}},

Journal = {{CHEMISTRYSELECT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{43}},
Pages = {{13477-13486}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{To investigate the effect of Ca poisoning on Cu-SAPO-18, a series of
   samples with different Ca amounts were prepared by the impregnation
   method, and their NH3-SCR activities were evaluated. When the Ca amount
   was 0.8 mmol/g(cat), NO conversion at 350 degrees C was 40.6\% (lower
   than that over the fresh Cu-SAPO-18 sample), which shows that the
   catalytic deNO(x) performance was significantly decreased after Ca
   poisoning. Ca poisoning did not have a great influence on the structure
   of Cu-SAPO-18, but the formed CaO blocked part of the micropores, which
   reduced surface area and micropore volume, and further reduced
   accessibility of the active sites and surface acidity of the sample. The
   total amount of the isolated Cu2+ species decreased from 62.83 mu
   mol/g(Cu-SAPO-18) to 23.45 mu mol/g(0.8Ca-Cu-SAPO-18), which resulted in
   conversion of the isolated Cu2+ species to Cu2O in the sample after the
   addition of Ca. In addition, the substitution of Ca2+ with H or Cu2+ in
   Si-O(H)-Al or Si-O(Cu2+)-Al to form the Si-O(Ca2+)-Al species decreased
   amounts of the Lewis and Bronsted acid sites, which might be the
   important reasons for the drop in catalytic activity. Both the
   Eley-Rideal (E-R) and Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) reaction mechanisms
   existed over the samples in the NH3-SCR reaction, but the L-H reaction
   mechanism was dominant. The catalytic mechanism over the sample did not
   change, but the reaction was slower after Ca poisoning.}},

Abstract = {{The righting reflex (RR) is frequently used to assess level of arousal
   and applied to animal models of a range of neurological disorders. RR
   produces a binary result that, when positive, is used to infer
   restoration of consciousness, often without further behavioral

Abstract = {{Lumentxa is a classic site in Basque Prehistory, excavated in three
   different phases during the 20th century, which has yielded evidence of
   both Pleistocene and Holocene occupations. In this article, we present a
   detailed study of the human remains from this site including
   paleobiological, taphonomic, biomechanical and chronological
   perspectives. The human assemblage comprises of a minimum number of
   seven individuals: three subadult and four adults, with both sexes
   represented, although part of the human collection is currently lost. We
   have obtained C14 dates from 4 of these 7 individuals indicating a
   prolonged funerary use of the cave from the Early Neolithic until the
   Bronze Age. We observed some biases in the skeletal representation which
   could be due to differences in the excavation methods between field
   seasons and/or the action of carnivores, the latter being evident in at
   least three of the individuals. The taphonomic modifications are typical
   off those found in the postabandonment phases in cave funerary contexts.
   The relatively low number of individuals compared with other sites in
   the region and extended timespan over which the remains were deposited
   suggest that the cave was used only sporadically for funerary purposes.
   We report the first biomechanical data for a Neolithic individual from
   the Iberian Peninsula, which show greatest overall similarity to the
   Neolithic sample from France and Italy. Finally, the broad time period
   covered by the direct dates and the more complex taphonomic history than
   was previously assumed for such sites indicate that caution is warranted
   when assigning sepulchral caves to cultural periods in the Western
   Pyrenees when no direct radiocarbon dates have been obtained.}},

Title = {{Recovery disparity between coral cover and the physical functionality of
   reefs with impaired coral assemblages}},

Abstract = {{The ecology and structure of many tropical coral reefs have been
   markedly altered over the past few decades. Although long-term recovery
   has been observed in terms of coral cover, it is not clear how novel
   species configurations shape reef functionality in impaired reefs. The
   identities and life-history strategies of the corals species that
   recover are essential for understanding reef functional dynamics. We
   used a species identity approach to quantify the physical functionality
   outcomes over a 13 year period across 56 sites in the Mexican Caribbean.
   This region was affected by multiple stressors that converged and
   drastically damaged reefs in the early 2000s. Since then, the reefs have
   shown evidence of a modest recovery of coral cover. We used Bayesian
   linear models and annual rates of change to estimate temporal changes in
   physical functionality and coral cover. Moreover, a functional diversity
   framework was used to explore changes in coral composition and the
   traits of those assemblages. Between 2005 and 2018, physical
   functionality increased at a markedly lower rate compared to that of
   coral cover. The disparity between recovery rates depended on the
   identity of the species that increased (mainly non-framework and
   foliose-digitate corals). No changes in species dominance or functional
   trait composition were observed, whereas non-framework building corals
   consistently dominated most reefs. Although the observed recovery of
   coral cover and functional potential may provide some ecological
   benefits, the long-term effects on reef frameworks remain unclear, as
   changes in the cover of key reef-building species were not observed. Our
   findings are likely to be representative of many reefs across the wider
   Caribbean basin, as declines in coral cover and rapid increases in the
   relative abundance of weedy corals have been reported regionally. A
   coral identity approach to assess species turnover is needed to
   understand and quantify changes in the functionality of coral reefs.}},

Abstract = {{Following a brief summary of some fundamentals in carbonate

   of organic matter, some examples of biocrystals in carbonate
   grains/particles, such as bioclasts or ooids, are provided as an
   introductory chapter to a discussion on gravitational cements versus
   endostromatolites. The gravitational cements, either marine (fibrous) or
   continental (dog-tooth), are made of hyaline (i.e., translucent)
   sparitic crystals whereas endostromatolites are made of colored sparitic
   crystals and/or micrite. Gravitational cements forms in the vadose zone
   whereas endostromatolites grow in small rock cavities in the marine
   phreatic zone. As such the latter can grow centripetally in all
   directions (not only downward).}},

Abstract = {{Label-free electrochemical immunosensors (EIs) are simple and sensitive
   in cancer diagnosis. Electrode materials which can offer a large
   specific area and excellent electrical conductivity play a critical role
   in the fabrication of EIs. In our study, ce-MoS2/AgNR composite was
   synthesized via Van der Waals force and electrostatic interaction
   between chemical exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets (ce-MoS2) and Ag nanorods
   (AgNRs). The conductivity of ce-MoS2/AgNR composite was almost three
   times higher than single ce-MoS2 because of the synergistic effect
   between ce-MoS2 and AgNRs. Furthermore, AgNRs could effectively inhibit
   the stacking of MoS2 nanosheets. The EIs for prostate-specific antigen
   (PSA) detection were fabricated based on ce-MoS2/AgNR composite. The
   fabricated EIs retained a wide linear response range (0.1-1000 ng/ml),
   low sensitivity (0.019 mu A/(ng ml(-1))), and low detection limit (0.051
   ng/ml) for the detection of PSA. Therefore, the EIs based on
   screen-printed electrode (SPE) and ce-MoS2/AgNR composite could be
   applied to clinical diagnosis of prostatic cancer and have potential
   application in the detection of other cancer biomarkers.}},

Journal = {{RESEARCH PAPERS IN EDUCATION}},
Abstract = {{The main purpose of this paper is to offer important insights into both
   immigrant and native students' experiences on interculturalism as well
   as identifying their inputs regarding the ways in which intercultural
   school development could occur. Interviews were carried out with 48
   children; 24 Cypriots and 24 immigrants from 4 primary schools in
   Cyprus. Based on their perspectives regarding the improvement of
   culturally diverse schools, three thematic categories emerged from the
   data analysis; the structural and school organisational level; the
   socio-personal level; and the didactic and curricular level. Arguably,
   on the basis of the data analysis, sub-factors underpinning these levels
   were found to have implications for educational policy and practice
   aiming at the promotion of cultural awareness, intercultural competence,
   inclusion and respect in schools.}},
