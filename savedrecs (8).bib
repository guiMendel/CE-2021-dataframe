Abstract = {{In this study, by using full-potential linearised augmented plane wave
   (FP-LAPW) method with the generalised gradient approximation (GGA) based
   on density functional theory (DFT), the structural, electronic, elastic
   and magnetic properties of the Heusler alloys Cr2NbSi1-xGex have been
   evaluated. The AlCu2Mnl-type structure is more stable than the
   CuHg2Ti-type structure at equilibrium volume for the compounds. The
   ground-state properties of our alloys including the lattice parameter
   and bulk modulus were calculated. In view of Poisson's and Pugh's ratio,
   the ductility and brittleness of Cr2NbSi1-xGex has been analysed. The
   mechanical stability is maintained throughout the pressure range with
   high value of Debye temperature. The electronic band structures and
   density of states of our compounds show a half metallic character with
   total magnetic moments, -3.00 mu B per formula unit with indirect band
   gap, Eg= 0.152 eV and 0.262 eV for Cr2NbSi and Cr2NbGe respectively.
   Furthermore, we have analysed the thermal properties by the
   quasi-harmonic Debye model. Through the obtained results, we can say
   that these compounds can be strong candidates for future spintronic
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{The aim was to compare the running activity in official matches with
   that achieved in two small-sided games, designed with the same relative
   area per player but with different constraints and field dimensions,
   aiming to stimulate high-speed and very-high-speed running. Seventeen
   young professional players played one 5 vs . 5+5 with 2 floaters,
   varying in terms of whether there was a change of playing area (SSG (CA)
   ) or not change (SSG (NC) ). Running activity was monitored using GPS
   and the following variables were recorded: total distance covered;
   high-speed distance (18-21km.h (-1) ); very high-speed distance (>21km.h
   (-1) ); peak speed; accelerations and decelerations between 2-3m.s (-2)
   and above 3m.s (-2) . SSG (CA) achieved statistically higher total
   distance, high-speed, peak speed and number of accelerations and
   decelerations than SSG (NC) (large to small magnitude). Both drills
   showed statistically greater high speed, number of accelerations and
   decelerations than official matches (large to small magnitude).
   Moreover, SSG (CA) exhibited statistically more total distance and
   distance at higher speed than official matches (moderate and small
   magnitude, respectively). In contrast, official matches showed
   statistically higher peak speeds than both training tasks and more very
   high speed than SSG (NC) (large and moderate magnitude, respectively).
   Coaches could use SSG (CA) to promote greater running activity in soccer
   players.}},

Abstract = {{Wearable electronics allow for new and immersive experiences between
   technology and the human body, but conventional devices are made from
   rigid functional components that lack the necessary compliance to safely
   interact with human tissue. Recently, liquid inclusions have been
   incorporated into elastomer composites to produce functional materials
   with high extensibility and ultrasoft mechanical responses. While these
   materials have shown high thermal and electrical conductivity, there has
   been an absence of research into compliant magnetic materials through
   the incorporation of magnetic fluids. Compliant magnetic materials are
   important for applications in soft matter engineering including sensing,
   actuation, and power transfer for soft electronics and robotics. In this
   work, we establish a new class of highly functional soft materials with
   advanced magnetic and mechanical properties by dispersing magnetic
   colloidal suspensions as compliant fluid inclusions into soft
   elastomers. Significantly, the rigid magnetic particles are encapsulated
   by the fluid. This mechanically cloaks the solid particles and enables a
   fluid-like mechanical response while imparting high magnetic
   permeability to the composite. This microstructure reduces the modulus
   of the composite below that of the initial elastomer to <40 kPa while
   increasing the permeability by over 100\% to greater than 2. We
   demonstrate the functionality of these materials through conformable
   magnetic backplanes, which enables a completely soft, coupled inductor
   system capable of transferring power up to 100\% strain and wearable
   devices for wireless power transfer.}},

   COVID-19 has had a dramatic impact in terms of screening (-86\% to
   -100\%), diagnosis (-39\%), and surgical treatment (-30\%). This global
   decrease in all essential oncology care pathway steps contrasted with
   the relative stability of chemotherapy (-9\%) and radiotherapy use
   (-16\%). Outbreak occurred earlier and with more intensity in Colmar but
   had a comparable impact in both areas regarding MTMBs and DAPs.

Abstract = {{Purpose In advanced pancreatic cancer (PC), en-bloc vein resection and
   reconstruction (VR) is a curative option in oncologic pancreatectomy.
   However, few data about long-term patency rates after autologous venous
   reconstruction are available. We aimed to analyze whether early
   postoperative morbidity is increased by additional VR. Furthermore,
   pathologic outcomes and long-term patency rates after applying
   autologous vein material are examined. Methods Data on patients who
   underwent surgical resection for suspicious malignancy were collected
   prospectively. Early postoperative complications, as well as the
   circumferential resection margins were analyzed retrospectively.
   Patients with VR (VR+) were compared with patients without vein
   resection (VR-). Vein reconstruction was always performed by autologous
   vein replacement, followed by a 6-month application of Enoxaparin.
   Patency rates of the mesenteric vessels in long-term follow-up exams
   were determined by contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) every 3
   months. Results Two hundred nineteen pancreatic resections for
   suspicious malignancy were performed. In 82 patients, VR occurred
   (37.4\%). No significant differences between VR+ and VR- were observed
   concerning 30-day mortality and postoperative morbidity. R0 rate did not
   differ between the two groups. By applying autologous vein material, the
   average patency rate was 90\%. Conclusion In terms of tumor free
   resection margins, equal oncologic results can be achieved by additional
   vein resection. Because the patency rate is high in follow-up, and early
   postoperative complication rates are not increased in patients with VR+,
   vein resection and reconstruction should be performed if oncologically
   necessary. The application of autologous vein reconstruction followed by
   a 6-month enoxaparin treatment seems to yield favorable technical
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Flowering time is important in the adaptation of crop plants to
   different environments and impacts the economic value of agricultural
   crops. Wheatgrass is a perennial Triticeae species and one of the most
   important grasses for pasture and forage in temperate regions of the
   world. Late heading is of interest in forage crop breeding programmes.
   Increasing the time to heading by molecular means may be facilitated by
   the identification and characterization of floral genes. In addition,
   the characterization of orthologous genes in wheatgrass is useful for
   establishing genetic relationships between grasses. In this study, we
   characterized a wheatgrass orthologue of the hexaploid wheat VRN-A1 gene
   involved in the vernalization response. High sequence similarity of this
   gene, designated VRN-P1, to both VRN-A1 and VRN-H1 and its localization
   on the 5PL chromosome arm in Agropyron cristatum indicated that VRN-P1
   is orthologous to VRN1 from wheat and barley. VRN-P1 retains the VRN1
   exon/intron organization and encodes a MADS-box transcription factor.
   Phylogenetic and amino acid analyses confirmed that the isolated
   sequence represents VRN1. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of the
   deduced protein sequence revealed an intimate genetic relationship
   between VRN-P1 and VRN1 from Triticeae species.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundThe Tibetan antelope Pantholops hodgsonii (Abel)
   (Artiodactyla: Bovidae) is an endangered species of mammal endemic to
   the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Parasites and parasitic diseases are
   considered to be important threats in the conservation of the Tibetan
   antelope. However, our present knowledge of the composition of the
   parasites of the Tibetan antelope remains limited.MethodsLarge numbers
   of nematode parasites were collected from a dead Tibetan antelope. The
   morphology of these nematode specimens was observed using light and
   scanning electron microscopy. The nuclear and mitochondrial DNA
   sequences, i.e. small subunit ribosomal DNA (18S), large subunit
   ribosomal DNA (28S), internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and cytochrome c
   oxidase subunit 1 (cox1), were amplified and sequenced for molecular
   identification. Moreover, phylogenetic analyses were performed using
   maximum likelihood (ML) inference based on 28S and 18S + 28S + cox1
   sequence data, respectively, in order to clarify the systematic status
   of these nematodes.ResultsIntegrated morphological and genetic evidence
   reveals these nematode specimens to be a new species of pinworm
   Skrjabinema longicaudatum (Oxyurida: Oxyuridae). There was no
   intraspecific nucleotide variation between different individuals of S.
   longicaudatum n. sp. in the partial 18S, 28S, ITS and cox1 sequences.
   However, a high level of nucleotide divergence was revealed between the
   new species and its congeners in 28S (8.36\%) and ITS (20.3-23.7\%)
   regions, respectively. Molecular phylogenetic results suggest that the
   genus Skrjabinema should belong to the subfamily Oxyurinae (Oxyuroidea:
   Oxyuridae), instead of the subfamily Syphaciidae or Skrjabinemiinae in
   the traditional classification, as it formed a sister relationship to
   the genus Oxyuris.ConclusionsA new species of pinworm Skrjabinema
   longicaudatum n. sp. (Oxyurida: Oxyuridae) is described. Skrjabinema
   longicaudatum n. sp. represents the first species of Oxyurida (pinworm)
   and the fourth nematode species reported from the Tibetan antelope. Our
   results contribute to the knowledge of the species diversity of
   parasites from the Tibetan antelope, and clarify the systematic position
   of the genus Skrjabinema.}},

Abstract = {{Community development has many meanings. The strength of this conceptual
   openness is that it creates space for communities and their knowledges,
   values and interests. Its weakness is that, without general agreement on
   the nature of community development, the concept is applied
   inconsistently and becomes a ``buzzword{''} which is high on
   application, yet low on meaning. This paper presents an analysis of
   community development as an essentially contested concept, highlighting
   descriptive and normative aspects of meanings and the role of context.
   It concludes with a range of actions that may assist in working through
   tensions between general definitions and conceptual openness.}},

Title = {{Straight eye for the queer ad: attitudes, skepticism, inferences of
   manipulative intent and willingness to buy}},
Journal = {{ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF MARKETING AND LOGISTICS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{33}},

Pages = {{1220-1238}},
Month = {{APR 20}},
Abstract = {{Purpose This study aims to provide a conceptual framework to investigate
   the effects of consumer attitudes toward brands and attitudes toward a
   series of fashion oriented print advertisements with and without
   homosexual themes, on consumer willingness to buy from brands. The
   influence of consumer skepticism and inferences of manipulative intent
   (IMI) as moderators between these variables is also investigated. This
   study also closes various research gaps identified within the
   literature. Design/methodology/approach A self-administered survey
   instrument was designed using established scales to collect data through
   an online questionnaire. Fashion advertisements namely one advertisement
   representing homosexual content and one heterosexual advertisement were
   used in the study within subjects (e.g. male and female) design.
   Statistical techniques, specifically factor analysis, regressions and
   multiple regressions are used to analyze the data. Findings The findings
   indicate significant and positive relationships between attitude toward
   the brand and advertisement as well as willingness to buy for both males
   and females. The moderation analyses noted that consumer skepticism
   enhanced the relationship between attitude toward the brand and attitude
   toward the advertisement, but weakened the relationship between attitude
   toward the advertisement and willingness to buy, only for the female
   cohort. Similarly, a weakening effect of IMI was noted on the
   relationship between attitude toward the advertisement and willingness
   to buy. Research limitations/implications The current study contributes
   to the literature on homosexual imagery in advertising. In applying the
   persuasion knowledge model, the current study demonstrates the
   applicability of the model to homosexual themes in fashion advertising
   while accounting for the effects of consumer skepticism and IMI.
   Practical implications The current research highlights the importance of
   accounting for gender differences when introducing homosexual themes in
   fashion advertisements. Heterosexual males and females differ in their
   attitudes toward homosexual themes in fashion advertising, as well as
   how skeptical they are with regards to the motives of the advertiser.
   While a great deal of acceptance is already present in today's society,
   these differences still need to be accounted for in future fashion
   advertising campaigns. Originality/value The present study represents an
   examination of consumer responses to a series of fashion advertisements
   in Australia and provides useful implications to marketers of fashion
   products. The study further contributes to the literature on consumer
   skepticism and IMI with regards to cause-related advertising.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in
   many human diseases, but their roles in secondary damage after spinal
   cord injury (SCI) remain unclear. In the current study circRNA
   sequencing was performed in the damaged tissues of SCI rats on the
   seventh day after injury, and related molecular mechanisms were
   investigated. Quantitative PCR validations of molecules that exhibited
   significantly altered expression in SCI mice were performed. Gene
   ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses were
   conducted to assess differentially expressed circRNAs. A novel
   circRNA-2960 was the most significantly upregulated in the SCI group. It
   could downregulate its target molecule miRNA-124, then exacerbate the
   inflammatory response and induce apoptosis at the lesion site.
   Disrupting circRNA-2960 expression promoted recovery of tissues affected
   by secondary SCI damage. The results of the present study may provide
   new insight into the mechanisms of secondary injury in SCI, and a new
   molecular marker for the diagnosis and treatment of SCI.}},

Abstract = {{Chalcogenide-based photonic crystal fibers (PCFs), due to their
   nonlinear properties, are capable of producing supercontinuum spectra,
   which can be used in the wavelength division multiplexing (WDM). These
   types of fibers highly absorb telecommunication wavelengths and hence
   cannot be used to transmit information over the corresponding
   wavelengths. We have studied the dispersion engineered chalcogenide PCF
   numerically, which is important to produce ultra-flat broadband
   supercontinuum (SC) spectra in all-normal dispersion areas. A 1 mm long,
   hexagonal chalcogenide PCF made from As2S3/Ge20Sb15Se65 and silica glass
   pumped at 1550 nm provided a SC bandwidth of 5000 nm with pump power of
   1 kW. Here, we have reached zero-dispersion wavelength (ZDW) at third
   telecommunication window, which in turn has given us a broad spectrum at
   this window with reasonable efficiency.}},

Title = {{Small RNA sequencing of extracellular vesicles identifies circulating
   miRNAs related to inflammation and oxidative stress in HIV patients}},
Journal = {{BMC IMMUNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 11}},
Abstract = {{Background Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-sized particles
   secreted by most cells. EVs carry nucleic acids that hold promise as
   potential biomarkers in various diseases. Human immunodeficiency virus
   type 1 (HIV) infects CD4+ T cells and induces immune dysfunction,
   inflammation, and EV secretion, but little is known about EV small RNA
   cargo in relation to immune dysregulation in HIV-infected individuals.
   Here, we characterize small RNA carried by circulating EVs in
   HIV-positive subjects on antiretroviral therapy (ART) relative to
   uninfected controls by next-generation RNA sequencing. Results Plasma
   EVs isolated from HIV-positive and HIV-negative subjects in test (n =
   24) and validation (n = 16) cohorts were characterized by electron
   microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and immunoblotting for
   exosome markers. EVs were more abundant in plasma from HIV-positive
   compared to HIV-negative subjects. Small RNA sequencing of plasma EVs in
   the test cohort identified diverse small RNA species including miRNA,
   piRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, tRNA, and rRNA, with miRNA being the most
   abundant. A total of 351 different miRNAs were detected in plasma EVs,
   with the top 50 miRNAs accounting for 90\% of all miRNA reads.
   miR-26a-5p was the most abundant miRNA, followed by miR-21-5p and
   miR-148-3p. qRT-PCR analysis showed that six miRNAs (miR-10a-5p, -
   21-5p, -27b-3p, - 122-5p, -146a-5p, - 423-5p) were significantly
   increased in plasma EVs from HIV-positive compared to HIV-negative
   subjects in the validation cohort. Furthermore, miR-21-5p, -27b-3p,
   -146a-5p, and - 423-5p correlated positively with metabolite markers of
   oxidative stress and negatively with anti-inflammatory polyunsaturated
   fatty acids. Over-representation and pathway enrichment analyses of
   miRNAs and their target genes predicted functional association with
   oxidative stress responses, interferon gamma signaling, Toll-like
   receptor signaling, TGF beta signaling, and Notch signaling. Conclusions
   HIV-positive individuals on ART have increased abundance of circulating
   EVs carrying diverse small RNAs, with miRNAs being the most abundant.
   Several miRNAs associated with inflammation and oxidative stress are
   increased in circulating EVs of HIV-positive individuals, representing
   potential biomarkers of targetable pathways that contribute to disease
   pathogenesis.}},

Month = {{NOV 11}},
Abstract = {{Time-of-flight dual photon emission computed tomography (TOF-DuPECT) is
   an imaging system that can obtain radionuclide distributions using time
   information recorded from two cascade-decay photons. The potential decay
   locations in the image space, a hyperbolic response curve, can be
   determined via time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) estimations from two
   instantaneous coincidence photons. In this feasibility study, Monte
   Carlo simulations were performed to generate list-mode coincidence data.
   A full-ring positron emission tomography-like detection system geometry
   was built in the simulation environment. A contrast phantom and a
   Jaszczak-like phantom filled with Selenium-75 (Se-75) were used to
   evaluate the image quality. A TOF-DuPECT system with varying coincidence
   time resolution (CTR) was then evaluated. We used the stochastic origin
   ensemble (SOE) algorithm to reconstruct images from the recorded
   list-mode data. The results indicate that the SOE method can be
   successfully employed for the TOF-DuPECT system and can achieve
   acceptable image quality when the CTR is less than 100 ps. Therefore,
   the TOF-DuPECT imaging system is feasible. With the improvement of the
   detector with time, future implementations and applications of
   TOF-DuPECT are promising. Further quantitative imaging techniques such
   as attenuation and scatter corrections for the TOF-DuPECT system will be
   developed in future.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known regarding how the tourists will perceive the
   post-pandemic travel particularly when planning to travel to the most
   affected global destinations. This study was designed in response to the
   COVID-19 pandemic and its adverse impact on the travel and tourism

   tourists' destination attachment and the intentions to return to
   European and Asian destinations after the pandemic. A total of 367
   participants were involved in the web-based survey. The results of the
   structural equation modeling demonstrated that in the event of a
   pandemic (1) the corporate social responsibility and the perceived
   response efforts were critical to generate the destination attachment
   and the approach behavioral intentions, (2) monetary promotions were not
   sufficient to generate the destination attachment and approach the
   behavioral intentions to the international destinations, and (3) the
   health preventive behavior and the destination attachment were important
   direct predictors of the approach behavioral intentions. These key
   findings could assist the travel and tourism companies to more
   effectively overcome the adverse impact of the pandemic on their

Title = {{Novel measurement tool and model for aberrant urinary stream in 3D
   printed urethras derived from human tissue}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 11}},
Abstract = {{Background
   An estimated 10\% of male adults have split or dribbled stream leading
   to poor hygiene, embarrassment, and inconvenience. There is no current
   metric that measures male stream deviation.
   Objective
   To develop a novel method to measure spray in normal and abnormal
   anatomical conformations.
   Design, setting, and participants
   We developed a novel platform to reliably describe spray. We used
   cadaveric tissues and 3D Printed models to study the impact of meatal
   shape on the urinary stream. Cadaveric penile tissue and 3D printed
   models were affixed to a fluid pump and used to simulate micturition.
   Dye captured on fabric allowed for spray detection.
   Outcome measurements and statistical analysis
   Spray pattern area, deviation from normal location, and flowrates were
   recorded. Computational fluid dynamic models were created to study fluid
   vorticity.
   Results and limitations
   Obstructions at the penile tip worsened spray dynamics and reduced flow.
   Ventral meatotomy improved flowrate (p<0.05) and reduced spray (p<0.05)
   compared to tips obstructed ventrally, dorsally or in the fossa
   navicularis. 3D models do not fully reproduce parameters of their parent
   cadaver material. The average flowrate from 3D model was 10ml/sec less
   than that of the penis from which it was derived (p = 0.03).
   Nonetheless, as in cadavers, increasing obstruction in 3D models leads
   to the same pattern of reduced flowrate and worse spray. Dynamic
   modeling revealed increasing distal obstruction was correlated to higher
   relative vorticity observed at the urethral tip.
   Conclusions
   We developed a robust method to measure urine spray in a research
   setting. Dynamic 3D printed models hold promise as a methodology to
   study common pathologies in the urethra and corrective surgeries on the
   urine stream that would not be feasible in patients. These novel methods
   require further validation, but offer promise as a research and clinical
   tool.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE \& DYNAMICS}},
Abstract = {{Inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase (CAIs) hold promise for addressing
   various diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and other metabolic
   syndromes. CAV is the only isoform present in the mitochondria and is
   considered a potential drug target for obesity. In this work, we have
   developed C2, and C4 substituted oxazole-5(4H)-one derivatives as a new
   scaffold for the selective inhibition of human carbonic anhydrase VA
   (hCAVA). Synthesized compounds were characterized by H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR,
   and LC-MS mass spectrometry and subsequently evaluated for in vitro
   hCAVA inhibition. Two compounds, 4 and 5 showed a considerably higher
   binding affinity for hCAVA in comparison to the hCAII. Further,
   cell-based studies showed that these compounds decrease the expression
   of CAVA and GLUT4 in adipocytes and non-toxic to HEK293 cells. The
   present work opens a platform for the use of oxazole-5(4H)-ones and
   holds promise for further refinement of potent and selective hCAVA
   inhibitors.

Abstract = {{In this study, we evaluate a set of high-resolution (25-50 km horizontal
   grid spacing) global climate models (GCMs) from the High-Resolution
   Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP), developed as part of the
   EU-funded PRIMAVERA (Process-based climate simulation: Advances in high
   resolution modelling and European climate risk assessment) project, and
   from the EURO-CORDEX (Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling
   Experiment) regional climate models (RCMs) (12-50 km horizontal grid
   spacing) over a European domain It is the first time that an assessment
   of regional climate information using ensembles of both GCMs and RCMs at
   similar horizontal resolutions has been possible. The focus of the
   evaluation is on the distribution of daily precipitation at a 50 km
   scale under current climate conditions. Both the GCM and RCM ensembles
   are evaluated against high-quality gridded observations in terms of
   spatial resolution and station density. We show that both ensembles
   outperform GCMs from the 5th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
   (CMIPS), which cannot capture the regional-scale precipitation
   distribution properly because of their coarse resolutions. PRIMAVERA
   GCMs generally simulate precipitation distributions within the range of
   EURO-CORDEX RCMs. Both ensembles perform better in summer and autumn in
   most European regions but tend to overestimate precipitation in winter
   and spring. PRIMAVERA shows improvements in the latter by reducing
   moderate-precipitation rate biases over central and western Europe. The
   spatial distribution of mean precipitation is also improved in
   PRIMAVERA. Finally, heavy precipitation simulated by PRIMAVERA agrees
   better with observations in most regions and seasons, while CORDEX
   overestimates precipitation extremes. However, uncertainty exists in the
   observations due to a potential undercatch error, especially during
   heavy-precipitation events.
   The analyses also confirm previous findings that, although the spatial
   representation of precipitation is improved, the effect of increasing
   resolution from 50 to 12 km horizontal grid spacing in EURO-CORDEX daily
   precipitation distributions is, in comparison, small in most regions and
   seasons outside mountainous regions and coastal regions. Our results
   show that both high-resolution GCMs and CORDEX RCMs provide adequate
   information to end users at a 50 km scale.}},

Abstract = {{The Hertzian contact parameters are evaluated by taking into account the
   increase in temperature of the wheel due to braking under a steady
   mechanical loading. An equivalent mechanical load is evolved by Finite
   Element Analysis (FEA) to produce the same effect of the mechanical and

   mechanical loading as well as for equivalent mechanical loading are
   matching. The contact parameters are found to vary linearly with
   temperature and equations are developed to obtain these parameters under
   thermal and mechanical loading. For 146.3 degrees C temperature of wheel
   due to braking, the contact pressure is 941.3 MPa, shear stress is 378
   MPa and for solo mechanical loading, they are 519.8 MPa and 191 MPa

Abstract = {{Purpose This study examined sexual minority status on perceived sense of
   belonging and compared sexual minority students and exclusively
   heterosexual students as a function of participating in work-integrated
   learning (WIL). Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional,
   quantitative design was used with participants grouped by sexual
   minority status and participation in WIL. Findings Sexual minority
   students (WIL and non-WIL) reported lower sense of belonging than
   exclusively heterosexual students (in WIL and non-WIL). Sexual minority
   students in WIL also reported significantly weaker sense of belonging
   compared to non-WIL sexual minority students suggesting that WIL
   presents some barriers to establishing a strong sense of belonging for
   sexual minority students. Originality/value The findings provide
   evidence for developing programs to ensure all students are in a safe
   environment where they can develop and strengthen their sense of
   belonging regardless of minority status. This is important given that a
   sense of belonging impacts mental health and overall well-being.}},

Title = {{The other side of droughts: wet extremes and topography as buffers of

Abstract = {{There is a consensus about negative impacts of droughts in Amazonia.
   Yet, extreme wet episodes, which are becoming as severe and frequent as
   droughts, are overlooked and their impacts remain poorly understood.
   Moreover, drought reports are mostly based on forests over a deep water
   table (DWT), which may be particularly sensitive to dry conditions.
   Based on demographic responses of 30 abundant tree species over the past
   two decades, in this study we analyzed the impacts of severe droughts
   but also of concurrent extreme wet periods, and how topographic
   affiliation (to shallow - SWTs - or deep - DWTs - water tables),
   together with species functional traits, mediated climate effects on
   trees.
   Dry and wet extremes decreased growth and increased tree mortality, but
   interactions of these climatic anomalies had the highest and most
   positive impact, mitigating the simple negative effects. Despite being
   more drought-tolerant, species in DWT forests were more negatively
   affected than hydraulically vulnerable species in SWT forests.
   Interaction of wet-dry extremes and SWT depth modulated tree responses
   to climate, providing buffers to droughts in Amazonia. As extreme wet
   periods are projected to increase and at least 36\% of the Amazon
   comprises SWT forests, our results highlight the importance of
   considering these factors in order to improve our knowledge about forest
   resilience to climate change.}},

   Switching in a Mutated Azurin Junction}},

Abstract = {{We observe reversible, bias-induced switching of conductance via a blue
   copper protein azurin mutant, N42C Az, with a nearly 10-fold increase at
   vertical bar V vertical bar > 0.8 V than at lower bias. No such
   switching is found for wild-type azurin, WT Az, up to vertical bar 1.2 V
   vertical bar, beyond which irreversible changes occur. The N42C Az
   mutant will, when positioned between electrodes in a solid-state
   Au-protein-Au junction, have an orientation opposite that of WT Az with
   respect to the electrodes. Current(s) via both proteins are
   temperature-independent, consistent with quantum mechanical tunneling as
   dominant transport mechanism. No noticeable difference is resolved
   between the two proteins in conductance and inelastic electron tunneling
   spectra at <vertical bar 0.5 V vertical bar bias voltages. Switching
   behavior persists from 15 K up to room temperature. The conductance peak
   is consistent with the system switching in and out of resonance with the
   changing bias. With further input from UV photoemission measurements on
   Au-protein systems, these striking differences in conductance are
   rationalized by having the location of the Cu(II) coordination sphere in
   the N42C Az mutant, proximal to the (larger) substrate-electrode, to
   which the protein is chemically bound, while for the WT Az that
   coordination sphere is closest to the other Au electrode, with which
   only physical contact is made. Our results establish the key roles that
   a protein's orientation and binding nature to the electrodes play in
   determining the electron transport tunnel barrier.}},

Abstract = {{Developing nations, including India, face a number of daunting
   challenges in the twenty-first century, including population growth,
   political strife, rapid urbanization, food and water scarcity,
   environmental pollution, infectious diseases, and climate change. In
   this turbulent era, there is a need for resilience at every level-from
   the village family to the corporate boardroom to the halls of
   government. We argue that achieving resilience will require both
   enlightened government policies and successful initiatives by social and
   environmental innovators that demonstrate the capacity for adapting to
   these challenges. Such practical first steps can serve as models for
   creating a more resilient and sustainable economy in India. One way to
   stimulate rapid progress is development of circular economy solutions
   that create innovative pathways for utilization of discarded materials,
   thus seeking to eliminate waste. Previous research has shown that such
   initiatives reduce environmental pressures and improve community
   resilience, while stimulating the regional economy. An international
   conference on Waste Management Innovation, held in 2017 in Mumbai with
   funding from the US Consulate General, resulted in the award of seed
   grants to two Indian non-profits that sought to apply circular economy
   principles to regional communities-one urban and one rural. These
   initiatives provide case studies of circular economy implementation. The
   World Institute of Sustainable Energy has developed an action plan to
   capture at least 60 percent of the electronic waste generated in the
   city of Pune, one of the largest metropolitan areas in India. Their
   approach is based on circular economy principles, and has been embraced
   in stakeholder meetings with city officials as well as local residents
   and non-governmental organizations. Barefoot College has established and
   demonstrated a low-cost, end-to-end solid waste management model for
   rural villages that is designed by the local community. Their unique
   approach ensures sanitation, environmental protection, income and
   livelihood generation, and drives behavioral change in village residents
   by motivating them to maintain community hygiene. This paper presents
   the results of these two efforts, and suggests what lessons were
   learned. One overarching insight is that an integrated systems view is
   necessary to understand the interplay of economic, environmental, and
   social forces.

Abstract = {{Endometriosis remains an enigmatic disease of unknown etiology, with
   delayed diagnosis and poor therapeutic options. This review will discuss
   the cellular, physiological, and genomic evidence of Sampson's
   hypothesis of retrograde menstruation as a cause of pelvic endometriosis
   and as the basis of phenotypic heterogeneity of the disease. We
   postulate that collaborative research at the single cell level focused
   on unlocking the cellular, physiological, and genomic mechanisms of
   endometriosis will be accompanied by advances in personalized diagnosis
   and therapies that target unique subtypes of endometriosis disease.
   These advances will address the clinical conundrums of endometriosis
   clinical care-including diagnostic delay, suboptimal treatments, disease
   recurrence, infertility, chronic pelvic pain, and quality of life. There
   is an urgent need to improve outcomes for women with endometriosis. To
   achieve this, it is imperative that we understand which cells form the
   lesions, how they arrive at distant sites, and what factors govern their
   ability to survive and invade at ectopic locations. This review proposes
   new research avenues to address these basic questions of endometriosis
   pathobiology that will lay the foundations for new diagnostic tools and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ATTENTION DISORDERS}},
Abstract = {{Objective:
   To describe bullying experiences throughout childhood of people with and
   without childhood ADHD and co-occurring learning and psychiatric
   disorders from a population-based birth cohort.
   Methods:
   In a secondary data analysis of 199 childhood ADHD cases and 287
   non-ADHD referents (N = 486), reported experiences of peer interactions
   during elementary, middle, or high school were classified as
   ``bully,{''} ``victim,{''} ``neither,{''} or ``both.{''} Associations
   were assessed with multinomial logistic regression.
   Results:
   Adjusted for male sex, the odds of classification as victim-only,
   victim/bully, or bully- only (vs. neither) were 3.70 (2.36-5.81), 17.71,
   and 8.17 times higher for childhood ADHD cases compared to non-ADHD
   referents. Victim-bullies (62.5\%) and bullies (64.3\%) had both
   childhood ADHD and other psychiatric disorders versus 38.4\% of
   victims-only and 17.3\% of those classified as ``neither.{''}
   Conclusion:
   The list of serious lifetime consequences of having ADHD also includes
   bullying. We offer future research directions for determining potential
   causal pathways.}},

Title = {{Spin shuttling in a silicon double quantum dot}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{NOV 11}},
Abstract = {{The transport of quantum information between different nodes of a
   quantum device is among the challenging functionalities of a quantum
   processor. In the context of spin qubits, this requirement can be met by
   coherent electron spin shuttling between semiconductor quantum dots.
   Here we theoretically study a minimal version of spin shuttling between
   two quantum dots. To this end, we analyze the dynamics of an electron
   during a detuning sweep in a silicon double quantum dot (DQD) occupied
   by one electron. Possibilities and limitations of spin transport are
   investigated. Spin-orbit interaction and the Zeeman effect in an
   inhomogeneous magnetic field play an important role for spin shuttling
   and are included in our model. Interactions that couple the position,
   spin, and valley degrees of freedom open a number of avoided crossings
   in the spectrum allowing for diabatic transitions and interfering paths.
   The outcomes of single and repeated spin shuttling protocols are
   explored by means of numerical simulations and an approximate analytical
   model based on the solution of the Landau-Zener problem. We find that a
   spin infidelity as low as 1 - F-s less than or similar to 0.002 with a
   relatively fast level velocity of alpha = 600 mu eV ns(-1) is feasible
   for optimal choices of parameters or by making use of constructive
   interference.}},

Title = {{Effects of post-discharge telemonitoring on 30-day chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease readmissions and mortality}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TELEMEDICINE AND TELECARE}},
Abstract = {{Introduction
   Much attention has been focused on decreasing chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease (COPD) hospital readmissions. The US health system has
   struggled to meet this goal. The objective of this study was to assess
   the efficacy of telehealth services on the reduction of hospital
   readmission and mortality rates for COPD.
   Methods
   We used a cross-sectional design to examine the association between
   hospital risk-adjusted readmission and mortality rates for COPD and
   hospital use of post-discharge telemonitoring (TM). Data for 777
   hospitals were sourced from the Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid
   Services and the American Hospital Association annual surveys.
   Propensity score matching using the kennel weights method was applied to
   calculate the weighted probability of being a hospital that offers
   post-discharge TM services.
   Results
   Hospitals with post-discharge TM had about 34\% significantly higher
   odds (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.34; 95\% confidence interval (CI)
   1.06-1.70) of 30-day COPD readmission and 33\% significantly lower odds
   (AOR = 0.67; 95\% CI 0.50-0.90) of 30-day COPD mortality compared to
   hospitals without post-discharge TM services.
   Discussion
   Overall, hospitals that offer post-discharge TM services have seen an
   improvement in 30-day COPD mortality rates. However, those same
   hospitals have also experienced a significant increase in 30-day COPD
   readmissions. TM can potentially decrease mortality in patients recently
   admitted for acute exacerbation of COPD. The results provide further
   evidence that readmissions present a problematic assessment of
   health-care quality, as the need for readmission may or may not be
   directly related to the quality of care received while in hospital.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Objectives: Cancer caregivers are at risk for
   experiencing health issues due to the stress of caregiving. Despite
   this, it is possible to prompt adaptive coping during the cancer
   experience. Adaptive coping is associated with improved health for
   caregiver populations. Forms of emotional disclosure are associated with
   caregiver reports of post-traumatic growth (PTG), which is an adaptive
   coping mechanism that comprises positive change following trauma. This
   study sought to identify areas of PTG identified by spousal
   hematopoietic stem-cell transplant (HSCT) cancer caregivers, via
   emotional disclosure writings.
   Design \& Method: Twenty-two spousal caregivers of patients who
   underwent a (HSCT) submitted emotional disclosure writings three times
   at one-week intervals. Writings centered on positive outcomes arising in
   light of the cancer experience. A qualitative grounded theory approach
   was used to evaluate caregiver accounts of PTG that arose while caring
   for their spouse.
   Results \& Conclusions: Findings suggest seven areas of PTG recognized
   through the disclosure process: living in the moment, a sense of honor
   and pride, choosing positivity, uninfluenced self-choice and expression,
   deprioritizing materialism, personal and/or spiritual connection, and
   altruistic expansion. The primary theoretical advancement arising from
   this study includes the notion that PTG largely appears to be a socially
   dependent process.}},

Abstract = {{Question Does preoperative cognitive exercise reduce the incidence of
   postoperative delirium in older adults undergoing major noncardiac
   surgery? Findings Results of this randomized clinical trial show
   patients who met at least minimum compliance with a preoperative
   cognitive exercise intervention had a significantly decreased incidence
   of postoperative delirium. Meaning Modification of postoperative
   delirium risk with brain exercise remains a novel concept in the early
   stages of clinical study, and more investigation appears warranted based
   on this work, including investigation into the ideal activities, timing,
   and effective dosage.
   Importance Postoperative delirium in older adults is a common and costly
   complication after surgery. Cognitive reserve affects the risk of
   postoperative delirium, and thus preoperative augmentation of reserve as
   a preventive technique is of vital interest. Objective To determine
   whether cognitive prehabilitation reduces the incidence of postoperative
   delirium among older adults. Design, Setting, and Participants This was
   a prospective, single-blinded randomized clinical trial conducted from
   March 2015 to August 2019 at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical
   Center in Columbus. Patients 60 years and older undergoing major,
   noncardiac, nonneurological surgery under general anesthesia, with an
   expected hospital stay of at least 72 hours, were eligible for trial
   inclusion. Patients were excluded for preoperative cognitive dysfunction
   and active depression. Interventions Participation in electronic,
   tablet-based preoperative cognitive exercise targeting memory, speed,
   attention, flexibility, and problem-solving functions. Main Outcomes and
   Measures The primary outcome was incidence of delirium between
   postoperative day 0 to day 7 or discharge, as measured by a brief
   Confusion Assessment Method, Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale, or a
   structured medical record review. Secondary outcomes compared delirium
   characteristics between patients in the intervention and control groups.
   Results Of the 699 patients approached for trial participation, 322
   completed consent and 268 were randomized. Subsequently, 17 patients
   were excluded, leaving 251 patients in the primary outcome analysis. A
   total of 125 patients in the intervention group and 126 control patients
   were included in the final analysis (median {[}interquartile range] age,
   67 {[}63-71] years; 163 women {[}64.9\%]). Ninety-seven percent of the
   patients in the intervention group completed some brain exercise
   (median, 4.6 {[}interquartile range, 1.31-7.4] hours). The delirium rate
   among control participants was 23.0\% (29 of 126). With
   intention-to-treat analysis, the delirium rate in the intervention group
   was 14.4\% (18 of 125; P = .08). Post hoc analysis removed 4 patients
   who did not attempt any cognitive exercise from the intervention group,
   yielding a delirium rate of 13.2\% (16 of 121; P = .04). Secondary
   analyses among patients with delirium showed no differences in
   postoperative delirium onset day or duration or total delirium-positive
   days across study groups. Conclusions and Relevance The intervention
   lowered delirium risk in patients who were at least minimally compliant.
   The ideal activities, timing, and effective dosage for cognitive
   exercise-based interventions to decrease postoperative delirium risk and
   burden need further study.
   This randomized clinical trial examines whether cognitive
   prehabilitation reduces the incidence of postoperative delirium among
   older adults.}},

   Public Health}},
Journal = {{HUMANITIES \& SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{In academia, faculty are bound by three pillars of scholarship:
   Teaching, Research and Service. Academic promotion and tenure depend on
   metrics of assessment for these three pillars. However, what is and is
   not acceptable as ``service{''} is often nebulous and left to the
   discretion of internal committees. With evolving requirements by funders
   to demonstrate wider impacts of research, we were keen to understand the
   financial and non-financial incentives for academic faculty to engage in
   knowledge translation and research utilization. Between November
   2017-February 2018, 52 faculty from one School of Public Health (SPH)
   were interviewed. Data was analyzed using Atlas.Ti and furthermore with
   framework analysis. The appeal of incentives varied according to
   personal values, previous experiences, relevance of research to
   decision-making, individual capacities, and comfort ranging from
   instinctive support to reflexive resistance. Discussions around types of
   incentives elicited a plethora of ideas within 4 different categories:
   (a) Monetary Support, (b) Professional Recognition, (c) Academic
   Promotion, and (d) Capacity Enhancement. However, concerns included
   adverse incentives, disadvantaging suboptimally-equipped faculty, risk
   of existing efforts going unnoticed, vaguely defined evaluation metrics,
   and the impacts on promotion given that engagement activities often
   occur outside of the traditional grant cycle. With a shift in funder
   requests to demonstrate greater social return on their research
   investments, as well as renewed global attention to research, science
   and evidence for decision making, SPHs such as this one, are likely
   going to be concerned about the implications of an enhanced
   ``service{''} pillar on the other two pillars: teaching and research.
   The role of incentives in enhancing academic engagement with policy and
   practice is therefore neither simple nor universally ideal. A tempered
   approach that considers the various professional aspirations of faculty,
   the capacities required, organisational culture of values around
   specific discovery sciences, funder conditions, as well as alignment
   with the institution's mission is critical. Deliberations on incentives
   leads to a larger debate on how to we shift the culture of academia
   beyond incentives for individuals who are engagement-inclined to
   institutions that are engagement-ready, without imposing on or
   penalizing faculty who are choice-disengaged.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals have the ability to extract summary statistics from multiple
   items presented simultaneously. However, it is unclear yet whether we
   have insight into the process of ensemble coding. The aim of this study
   was to investigate metacognition about average face perception.
   Participants saw a group of four faces presented for 2 s or 5 s, and
   then they were asked to judge whether the following test face was
   present in the previous set (Experiment 1), or whether the test face was
   the average of the four member faces (Experiment 2). After each
   response, participants rated their confidence. Replicating previous
   findings, there was substantial endorsement for the average face derived
   from the four member faces in Experiment 1, even though it was not
   present in the set. When judging faces that had been presented in the
   set, confidence correlated positively with accuracy, providing evidence
   for metacognitive awareness of previously studied faces. Importantly,
   there was a negative confidence-accuracy relationship for judging
   average faces when duration was 2 s, and a near-zero relationship when
   duration was 5 s. By contrast, when the average face had to be
   identified explicitly in Experiment 2, performance was above chance
   level and there was a positive correlation between confidence and
   accuracy. These results suggest that people have metacognitive awareness
   about average face perception when averaging is required explicitly, but
   they lack insight into the averaging process when member identification
   is required.}},

Abstract = {{The on-surface synthesis of covalently bonded materials differs from
   solution-phase synthesis in several respects. The transition from a
   three-dimensional reaction volume to quasi-two-dimensional confinement,
   as is the case for on-surface synthesis, has the potential to facilitate
   alternative reaction pathways to those available in solution.
   Ullmann-type reactions, where the surface plays a role in the coupling
   of aryl-halide functionalised species, has been shown to facilitate
   extended one- and two-dimensional structures. Here we employ a
   combination of scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray standing wave (XSW) analysis to perform a
   chemical and structural characterisation of the Ullmann-type coupling of
   two iodine functionalised species on a Ag(111) surface held under
   ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions. Our results allow characterisation
   of molecular conformations and adsorption geometries within an
   on-surface reaction and provide insight into the incorporation of metal
   adatoms within the intermediate structures of the reaction. Ullmann-type
   reactions on metal surfaces are widely studied examples of on-surface
   synthesis. Here the combination of normal incidence X-ray standing wave
   analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning tunneling
   microscopy enables the characterisation of molecular conformations in
   two such reactions.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale systems engineering projects consist of hundreds to

Title = {{Vitamin D Levels and Bone Mineral Density in Premenopausal women
   Compared to Postmenopausal Women: A Multi-Centre Study From Pakistan}},
Journal = {{CUREUS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Introduction
   Despite the sunny climate, women in Pakistan are prone to vitamin D
   deficiency and subsequent low bone mineral density. The current study
   explores the extent of this deficiency in both pre- and postmenopausal
   women in our setting.
   Methodology
   A cross-sectional study was conducted at the outpatient departments of
   Lady Reading Hospital and Hayatabad Medical Complex Peshawar, Pakistan
   during the time period between March 2018 and June 2019. Hundred
   premenopausal women (control group) and 100 postmenopausal women (study
   group) were inducted in the study. Serum vitamin D levels were
   determined in patients with suspected vitamin D deficiency. Bone mineral
   density (BMD) was determined for each patient and the cost of each scan
   was afforded by our department. A dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry
   (DEXA) scan was used to perform the bone mineral density assessment. The
   data was analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS)
   version 26 (IBM, Chicago, IL).
   Results
   Serum 250HD concentration in postmenopausal women was significantly
   lower compared to premenopausal women (p<0.001). In the study group,
   36.0\% of women had a severe deficiency of serum vitamin D levels,
   whereas, in the control group, only two women suffered from severe
   deficiency of vitamin D. Similarly, bone mineral density was also
   significantly correlated with the menopausal status of the women
   (p<0001). It was found that three-fifths of the postmenopausal women had
   a low bone density. Twenty-four percent of postmenopausal women had very
   low BMD. In comparison, only a single premenopausal woman was found to
   have a 2-score of below -2.0.
   Conclusion
   The current study highlights the impact of menopause on vitamin D levels
   and BMD. In our study, we found a significant difference between vitamin
   D levels and BMD in women of reproductive age compared to postmenopausal
   women.}},

Title = {{Sucrose Intakes and Incident Colorectal Cancer Risk among Women}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF NUTRITION}},
Abstract = {{Background
   High sucrose intakes are hypothesized to increase colorectal cancer
   (CRC) risk by several mechanisms, and sucrose intakes have been
   consistently positively associated with CRC risk in case-control
   studies. However, all but one prospective study reported a null
   sucrose-CRC association. The only prospective study to report a positive
   association was the Iowa Women's Health Study (IWHS) of 35,221
   cancer-free Iowa women, aged 55 - 69 years old at baseline in 1986,
   after four years of follow up.
   Materials and methods
   To address the discrepant findings in the literature, after 26 years of
   follow up in the IWHS, we updated and expanded on our earlier reported
   analyses. During follow up through 2012, 1,731 women were diagnosed with
   CRC. Baseline dietary intakes were assessed with a Willett
   semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. We used multivariable Cox
   proportional hazards regression models to estimate adjusted hazards
   ratios (HRs) and their 95\% confidence intervals (CI).
   Results
   For those in the highest relative to the lowest intake quintiles, the
   adjusted HRs (95\% CI) for CRC were 1.04 (0.87-1.23; P-trend = 0.59) for
   sucrose, 1.00 (0.82-1.21; P-trend = 0.67) for sucrose-containing foods,
   and 1.01, (0.83-1.22; P-trend = 0.56) for nondairy sucrose-containing
   foods, respectively. These findings did not differ substantially by
   colorectal site or according to categories of selected participant
   characteristics.
   Conclusions
   Our findings do not support that intakes of sucrose or
   sucrose-containing foods are substantially associated with CRC risk
   among older women.}},

Abstract = {{Halide perovskites have attracted increasing research attention with
   regard to their potential for optoelectronic applications. Because of
   its low activation energy, ion migration is implicated in the long-term
   stability and many unusual transport behaviors of halide perovskite
   devices. However, direct observation and precise control of the ionic
   transport in halide perovskite crystals remain challenging. Here, we
   have designed an axial CsPbBr3 -CsPbCl3 nanowire heterostructure, in
   which electric-field-induced halide ion migration was clearly visualized
   and quantified. We demonstrated that halide ion migration is dependent
   on the applied electric field and exhibits ionic rectification in this
   solid-state system, which is due to the nonuniform distribution of the
   ionic vacancies in the nanowire that results from a competition between
   electrical screening and their creation/destruction at the electrodes'
   interfaces. The asymmetric heterostructure characteristics add an
   additional knob to control the ion movement in the design of advanced
   ionic circuits with halide perovskites as building blocks.}},

Abstract = {{This research presents the results of studies designed to observe the
   effects of school leadership and school culture as mechanisms of change
   in the context of a large-scale educational reform in Bosnia and
   Herzegovina. A mixed-methods approach was employed to illuminate how
   institutional context either activates or deactivates leadership and
   school cultures as mechanisms that influence teacher efficacy beliefs in
   times of large-scale educational reform. Quantitative and qualitative
   data were analyzed through three independent studies. Quantitative
   procedures included measurement model analysis, structural equation
   modeling and a non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test. The qualitative
   analytic approach encompassed procedures of content analysis and
   quantification of qualitative data from reform documents and
   semi-structured interviews in the form of hierarchical clustering and
   multidimensional scaling. The triangulation of findings occurred in the
   interpretation phase, characterized by the development of
   meta-inferences that go beyond the findings from each study.}},

Title = {{Independent risk factors for acute hospital patients' reduced ability to
   hear electronic axillary thermometer alarms}},
Journal = {{JAPAN JOURNAL OF NURSING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2021}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Aim Hearing loss prevalence increases dramatically with age. However, no
   prior studies exist regarding the prevalence and factors related to
   reduced ability to hear alarm sounds using electronic axillary
   thermometers. This study aimed to investigate the number of individuals
   with a reduced ability to hear the alarm sound of the electronic
   axillary thermometers among participants over 20 and 65 years old
   (Objective 1) and to identify the factors associated with reduced
   ability to hear the alarm sound (Objective 2).
   Methods In this 5-month cross-sectional study, the participants, aged >=
   20 years, were recruited from samples of patients at an acute hospital.
   The outcome measured was the average number of seconds for each
   participant between the axillary placement of a thermometer tip and
   their report of hearing the alarm, performed three times per patient.
   Results Complete data were obtained from 107 participants, with 58
   (54.2\%) showing a reduced ability to hear the alarm. The prevalence of
   reduced ability to hear the alarm was 69.5\% (>65 years older).
   Multivariate analysis demonstrated that age was the factor most
   significantly associated with reduced hearing ability. Age 70 was
   determined as the cut-off point for ability to hear the alarm.
   Conclusions This is a serious issue, as many individuals with the
   inability to hear the alarm sound use the electronic axillary
   thermometer with the alarm sound. For a reliable measurement of body
   temperature, digital thermometers need alternative alarm signals, (e.g.,
   vibration) for self-use by adults >= 70 years to correctly measure body
   temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the intriguing properties of Chitosan (CS), many efforts have
   been paid for CS-based fiber preparation. As it is impossible to prepare
   CS fiber directly, facilitating polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)
   possessing necessary properties that enable CS-based fiber fabrication
   is used. For this purpose, 3 wt\% of CS in 90\% acetic acid solution and
   6 wt\% PVA solution in DI water used in CS/PVA fiber preparation at
   different proportions for example, 2:1, 9:1 and 10:1 by weight to
   fabricate fibers by electrospinning method. Furthermore, to render
   fluorescent property to CS/PVA (9:1) fibers, N-doped carbon dots
   (C-dots) added into fiber precursor during fiber preparation. The
   emission peak of C-dots based fibers that with fluorescent features was
   observed at around 436 nm. The morphological, structural and, thermal
   characterizations of CS-based fibers were done with scanning electron
   microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and
   thermogravimetric analyzer, respectively. Anti-bacterial activity of
   bare CS/PVA was increased with the increase in amounts of C-dots
   embedding. The inhibition of zone of CS/PVA (9:1) fibers was increased
   from 1.8 +/- 0.2 cm to 2.1 +/- 0.3 cm and 2.9 +/- 0.4 cm against E. coli
   by increasing the amounts of C-dots from 2.9 mg and 5 mg. Also, the same
   behavior was observed against S. aureus where the inhibition zone is
   increased from 2.5 +/- 0.1 cm to 3.2 and 3.5 cm by doubling the C-dots
   amounts in CS/PVA fiber. Moreover, bare and C-dots containing CS/PVA
   fibers were found blood compatible (nonhemolytic) up to 1 mg/mL
   concentration according to hemolysis and blood clotting tests.}},

Title = {{Population genetics of the freshwater fish Prochilodus magdalenae
   (Characiformes: Prochilodontidae), using species-specific microsatellite
   loci}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 11}},
Abstract = {{Prochilodus magdalenae is a freshwater fish endemic to the Colombian
   Magdalena-Cauca and Caribbean hydrographic basins. The genetic structure
   patterns of populations of different members of Prochilodus and the
   historic restocking of its depleted natural populations suggest that P.
   magdalenae exhibits genetic stocks that coexist and co-migrate
   throughout the rivers Magdalena, Cauca, Cesar, Sinu and Atrato. To test
   this hypothesis and explore the levels of genetic diversity and
   population demography of 725 samples of P. magdalenae from the studied
   rivers, we developed a set of 11 species-specific microsatellite loci
   using next-generation sequencing, bioinformatics, and experimental tests
   of the levels of diversity of the microsatellite loci. The results
   evidenced that P. magdalenae exhibits high genetic diversity,
   significant inbreeding coefficient ranging from 0.162 to 0.202, and
   signs of erosion of the genetic pool. Additionally, the population
   genetic structure constitutes a mixture of genetic stocks
   heterogeneously distributed along the studied rivers, and moreover, a
   highly divergent genetic stock was detected in Chucuri, Puerto Berrio
   and Palagua that may result from restocking practices. This study
   provides molecular tools and a wide framework regarding the genetic
   diversity and structure of P. magdalenae, which is crucial to complement
   its baseline information, diagnosis and monitoring of populations, and
   to support the implementation of adequate regulation, management, and
   conservation policies.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundHuman granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) is a tick-borne
   infectious disease caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilum. To date, there
   have been no reported cases of A. phagocytophilum infection found in
   both the biting tick and the patient following a tick bite.Case
   presentationAn 81-year-old woman presented with fever following a tick
   bite, with the tick still intact on her body. The patient was diagnosed
   with HGA. The tick was identified as Ixodes nipponensis by morphological
   and molecular biological detection methods targeting the 16S rRNA gene.
   The patient's blood was cultured after inoculation into the human
   promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60. A. phagocytophilum growth was
   confirmed via culture and isolation. A. phagocytophilum was identified
   in both the tick and the patient's blood by Anaplasma-specific groEL-
   and ankA-based nested polymerase chain reaction followed by sequencing.
   Moreover, a four-fold elevation in antibodies was observed in the
   patient's blood.ConclusionWe report a case of a patient diagnosed with
   HGA following admission for fever due to a tick bite. A. phagocytophilum
   was identified in both the tick and the patient, and A. phagocytophilum
   was successfully cultured. The present study suggests the need to
   investigate the possible incrimination of I. nipponensis as a vector for
   HGA in Korea.}},

Abstract = {{In this digital world integrating smart city concepts, there is a
   tremendous scope and need for e-governance applications. Now people
   analyze the opinion of others before purchasing any product, hotel
   booking, stepping onto restaurants etc. and the respective user share
   their experience as a feedback towards the service. But there is no
   e-governance platform to obtain public opinion grievances towards
   covid19, government new laws, policies etc. With the growing
   availability and emergence of opinion rich information's, new
   opportunities and challenges might arise in developing a technology for
   mining the huge set of public messages, opinions and alert the
   respective departments to take necessary actions and also nearby
   ambulances if its related to covid-19. To overcome this pandemic
   situation a natural language processing based efficient e-governance
   platform is demandful to detect the corona positive patients and provide
   transparency on the covid count and also alert the respective health
   ministry and nearby ambulance based on the user voice inputs. To convert
   the public voice messages into text, we used Hidden Markov Models
   (HMMs). To identify respective government department responsible for the
   respective user voice input, we perform pre-processing, part of speech,
   unigram, bigram, trigram analysis and fuzzy logic (machine learning
   technique). After identifying the responsible department, we perform 2
   methods, (1) Automatic alert e-mail and message to the government
   departmental officials and nearby ambulance or covid camp if the user
   input is related to covis19. (2) Ticketing system for public and
   government officials monitoring. For experimental results, we used Java
   based web and mobile application to execute the proposed methodology.
   Integration of HMM, Fuzzy logic provides promising results.}},

Title = {{Changes in transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles of morphotypes of
   Ophiocordyceps sinensis within the hemocoel of its host larvae,
   Thitarodes xiaojinensis}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundOphiocordyceps sinensis (Berk.) is a well-known
   entomopathogenic and medicinal fungus. It parasitizes and mummifies the
   underground ghost moth larvae to produce a fruiting body named Chinese
   cordyceps. Specific for the fungus, O. sinensis experiences a biotrophic
   vegetative growth period spanning over 5months. During this vegetative
   growth, it appears successively in the host hemocoel in three/four
   morphotypes, namely, the yeast-like blastospores (subdivided into
   proliferative (BP) and stationary phase (BS)), prehyphae (PreHy) and the
   hyphae (Hy). This peculiar morphogenesis has been elucidated through
   morphological and ultrastructural observations, but its molecular basis
   remains cryptic. In this study, transcriptome and metabolome profiling
   of BP, BS, PreHy and Hy stages were performed to characterize the key
   genes, metabolites, and signaling pathways that regulated the vegetative
   development of O. sinensis in Thitarodes xiaojinensis larva.ResultsThe
   molecular events and metabolic pathways that regulated different
   intracellular processes at various stages were examined. Cluster
   analyses of differentially expressed genes across the four stages
   revealed the stage specifically enriched pathways. Analysis of
   metabolome profiles showed that carbon metabolism and several amino
   acids biosynthesis were significantly perturbed during the tested
   development stages of O. sinensis in the host hemocoel. Genes homologous
   to Saccharomyces cerevisiae MAPK cascade were significantly up-regulated
   during the transition from blastospore to hypha. The up-regulation of
   Sho1, a regulator protein, suggested nutrient starvation act a role in
   activation of MAPK pathway and filamentous growth. In addition,
   up-regulation of several fatty acid synthesis genes and their
   corresponding products accumulation in the samples of BS might explain
   more lipid droplets were observed in BS than in BP. Coupled with the
   up-regulation of fatty acid degradation during PreHy and Hy stages, it
   is presumed that lipid accumulation and mobilization play important
   roles in filamentous development.ConclusionsThis is the first report
   comprehensively describing developmental transcriptomics and
   metabolomics of O. sinensis in vivo. Our findings provide new
   perspectives into the key pathways and hub genes involved in
   morphological changes of fungus developed in the hemocoel of its host,
   and are expected to guide future studies on morphogenesis and morphotype
   changes of entomopathogenic fungi in vivo.}},

Title = {{A study on design and properties of woven-nonwoven multi-layered hybrid
   geotextiles}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL TEXTILES}},
Abstract = {{The area of forests continues decreasing while the water/soil loss
   becomes worse. In these complicated environments, mechanical properties,
   stability, high modulus and low elongation of geotextiles are required.
   On a premise of the acquisition of good mechanical properties and the
   improvement in the deformation and puncture resistance of nonwoven
   fabric, woven/nonwoven hybrid geotextiles are designed and made with
   needle punch processing technology in this study. The test results
   indicate that the mechanical properties of hybrid geotextiles are
   improved significantly when the areal density of nylon fabrics is
   increased. In particular, with the areal density of 400 g/m(2), hybrid
   geotextiles exhibit the maximal mechanical properties and puncture
   resistance. Moreover, the pore fraction of hybrid geotextiles decreases
   as a result of a rise in the areal density of nylon top/bottom layers.
   The use of a 3 D mesh fabric as the interlayer provides the needle
   punched composite geotextiles with the highest tensile resistance,
   puncture resistance. The composite geotextiles are treated with acid and
   alkali to simulate the corrosion under natural conditions of stabilized
   soil. The resultant geotextile has good mechanical properties and
   acid/alkali degradation resistance. This allows the hybrid geotextiles
   to stabilize water and soil conservation in complicated conditions.}},

Month = {{NOV 11}},
Abstract = {{The sulfonated polyoxadiazole (SPOD) flame retardant fibers are prepared
   by wet spinning and modified by metal ions (Na+, Ca2+, Ba2+, and Mg2+).
   The structures of SPOD fibers are characterized by Fourier transform
   infrared spectrometry (FTIR), elements analysis (EA), inductively
   coupled plasma emission spectrometry (ICP), scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS). Results show that
   sulfonate groups were successfully grafted on the POD fiber polymer, and
   metal ions are adsorbed in the fiber by physical and chemical
   adsorption. The micro-scale combustion calorimeter (MCC), limiting
   oxygen index (LOI), and UL-94 vertical burning tests are used to test
   the flame retardant properties of the fibers. Results show that the
   Mg-SPOD had the best flame retardant performance with LOI of 40\% and
   the lowest heat release rate (HRR). The thermal degradation mechanism of
   the fiber is analyzed by thermogravimetric analysis coupled with
   infrared spectrometry (TG-FTIR), and the char residues were investigated
   by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM). The rapid and sharp emission of non-flammable SO2 and
   high content char residue covered with dense MgO and MgSO4 improve the
   flame retardant properties of Mg-SPOD fibers significantly.}},

Abstract = {{Developing unique single atoms as active sites is vitally important to
   boosting the efficiency of photocatalytic CO2 reduction, but directly
   atomizing metal particles and simultaneously adjusting the configuration
   of individual atoms remain challenging. Herein, we demonstrate a facile
   strategy at a relatively low temperature (500 degrees C) to access the
   in situ metal atomization and coordination adjustment via the
   thermo-driven gaseous acid. Using this strategy, the pyrolytic gaseous
   acid (HCl) from NH4Cl could downsize the large metal particles into
   corresponding ions, which subsequently anchored onto the surface defects
   of a nitrogen-rich carbon (NC) matrix. Additionally, the low-temperature
   treatment-induced C=O motifs within the interlayer of NC could bond with
   the discrete Fe sites in a perpendicular direction and finally create
   stabilized Fe-N4O species with high valence status (Fe3+) on the shallow
   surface of the NC matrix. It was found that the Fe-N4O species can
   achieve a highly efficient CO2 conversion when accepting energetic
   electrons from both homogeneous and heterogeneous photocatalysts. The
   optimized sample achieves a maximum turnover number (TON) of 1494 within
   1 h in CO generation with a high selectivity of 86.7\% as well as
   excellent stability. Experimental and theoretical results unravel that
   high valence Fe sites in Fe-N4O species can promote the adsorption of
   CO2 and lower the formation barrier of key intermediate COOH{*} compared
   with the traditional Fe-N-4 moiety with lower chemical valence. Our
   discovery provides new points of view in the construction of more
   efficient single-atom cocatalysts by considering the optimization of the
   atomic configuration for high-performance CO2 photoreduction.}},

   P. mirabilis FHL hydrogenase and the FHL activator, FhlA. fhlA and hyfG
   (encoding hydrogenase large subunit) displayed a defect in acid
   resistance. fhlA and hyfG mutants displayed a delay in medium
   deacidification compared to wild-type and ureC mutant failed to
   deacidify the medium. In addition, loss of fhlA or hyfG decreased urease
   activity in the pH range of 5-8. The reduction of urease activities in
   fhlA and hyfG mutants subsided gradually over the pH range and
   disappeared at pH 9. Furthermore, mutation of fhlA or hyfG resulted in a
   decrease in urinary stone formation in synthetic urine. These indicate
   fhlA- and hyf-mediated deacidification affected urease activity and
   stone formation. Finally, fhlA and hyfG mutants exhibited attenuated
   colonization in mice. Altogether, we found expression of fhlA and hyf
   confers medium deacidification via facilitating urease activity, thereby
   urinary stone formation and mouse colonization. The link of acid
   resistance to urease activity provides a potential strategy for
   counteracting urinary tract infections by P. mirabilis.}},

Abstract = {{Background Periimplantitis is a challenging condition to manage and is
   frequently treated using non-surgical debridement. The local delivery of
   antimicrobial agents has demonstrated benefit in mild to moderate cases
   of periimplantitis. This study compared the safety and efficacy of
   Chlorhexidine gluconate 2.5 mg chip (CHX chips) as an adjunctive
   treatment to sub-gingival debridement in patients afflicted with
   periimplantitis.
   Methods A multicenter, randomized, single-blind, two-arm, parallel
   Phase-3 study was conducted. Periimplantitis patients with implant
   pocket depths (IPD) of 5-8 mm underwent sub-gingival implant surface
   debridement followed by repeated bi-weekly supra-gingival plaque removal
   and Chlorhexidine chips application (ChxC group) for 12 weeks, or
   similar therapy but without application of ChxC (control group). All
   patients were followed for 24 weeks. Plaque and gingival indices were
   measured at every visit whereas IPD, recession, and bleeding on probing
   were assessed at 8, 12, 16, 24 week.
   Results A total of 290 patients were included: 146 in the ChxC group and
   144 in the control. At 24 weeks, a significant reduction in IPD (P =
   0.01) was measured in the ChxC group (1.76 +/- 1.13 mm) compared with
   the control group (1.54 +/- 1.13 mm). IPD reduction of >= 2 mm was found
   in 59\% and 47.2\% of the implants in the ChxC and control groups,
   respectively (P = 0.03). Changes in gingival recession (0.29 +/- 0.68 mm
   versus 0.15 +/- 0.55 mm, P = 0.015) and relative attachment gain (1.47
   +/- 1.32 mm and 1.39 +/- 1.27 mm, P = 0.0017) were significantly larger
   in the ChxC group. Patients in the ChxC group that were < 65 years
   exhibited significantly better responses (P < 0.02); likewise,
   non-smokers had similarly better response (P < 0.02). Both protocols
   were well tolerated, and no severe treatment-related adverse events were
   recorded throughout the study.
   Conclusions Patients with periimplantitis that were treated with an
   intensive treatment protocol of bi-weekly supra-gingival plaque removal
   and local application of Chlorhexidine chips had greater mean IPD
   reduction and greater percentile of sites with IPD reduction of >= 2 mm
   as compared with bi-weekly supra-gingival plaque removal.

Abstract = {{We present a validation of red blood cell flux and speed measurements
   based on the passage of erythrocytes through the OCT's focal volume. We
   compare the performance of the so-called RBC-passage OCT technique to
   co-localized and simultaneously acquired two-photon excitation
   fluorescence microscopy (TPEF) measurements. Using concurrent
   multi-modal imaging, we show that fluctuations in the OCT signal display
   highly similar features to TPEF time traces. Furthermore, we demonstrate
   an overall difference in RBC flux and speed of 2.5 +/- 3.27 RBC/s and
   0.12 +/- 0.67 mm/s (mean +/- S.D.), compared to TPEF. The analysis also
   revealed that the OCT RBC flux estimation is most accurate between 20
   RBC/s to 60 RBC/s, and is severely underestimated at fluxes beyond 80
   RBC/s. Lastly, our analysis shows that the RBC speed estimations
   increase in accuracy as the speed decreases, reaching a difference of
   0.16 +/- 0.25 mm/s within the 0-0.5 mm/s speed range.}},

Abstract = {{The postharvesting disorder leaf blackening is the main cause of product
   rejection in Protea during export. In this study, we report an
   investigation into metabolites associated with leaf blackening in Protea
   species. Methanol extracts of leaf and involucral bract tissue were
   analyzed by liquid chromatography hyphenated to photodiode array and
   high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-PDA-HRMS), where 116 features were
   annotated. Analytical data obtained from 37 Protea species, selections,
   and hybrids were investigated using metabolomics tools, which showed
   that stems susceptible to leaf blackening cluster together and contained
   features identified as benzenetriol- and/or hydroquinone-derived
   metabolites. On the other hand, species, selections, and cultivars not
   prone to blackening were linked to metabolites with known protective
   properties against biotic and abiotic stressors. During the browning
   process, susceptible cultivars also produce these protective
   metabolites, yet at innately low levels, which may render these species
   and cultivars more vulnerable to blackening. Metabolites that were found
   to be correlated to the instigation of the browning process, all
   comprising benzenetriol- and hydroquinone-glycoside derivatives, are
   highlighted to provide preliminary insights to guide the development of
   new Protea cultivars not susceptible to leaf blackening.}},

Journal = {{NEW MEDIA \& SOCIETY}},
Abstract = {{Creative workers in the social media industries face the imperative to
   brand themselves to audiences, corporate sponsors, and potential
   customers. This study complicates the role of self-branding on social
   media through the case of real-time creative labor on a social live
   streaming platform. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork and in-depth
   interviews with live creators and viewers, this study suggests that the
   affordances of social live streaming platforms create a media and
   relational environment wherein personal branding practices are belabored
   by both creators and audiences. This phenomenon, which we term
   participatory branding, redistributes the labor of personal branding on
   social media and emphasizes the work of audiences in helping to shape
   the brand of a creative worker. We then advance a typology that maps the
   terrain of personal branding on social media as it relates to platform
   affordances, cross-platform promotion, and audience activity in content
   creation.}},

Abstract = {{When measuring the energy balance at the earth's surface using the Eddy
   covariance technique, the obtained budgets seldom produce a closed
   energy balance. The measurements often miss some of the energy fluxes. A
   possible reason is the neglect of non-turbulent surface fluxes of latent
   heat and sensible heat, i.e. advective fluxes of these quantities. We
   present estimates of advective latent and sensible heat fluxes for three
   different sites across Europe based on the ADVEX dataset. The obtained
   horizontal and vertical advective fluxes were site-specific and
   characterized by large scatter. In relative terms, the data indicated
   that the sensible heat budget was less affected by advection than the
   latent heat budget during nighttime; this is because vertical turbulent
   latent heat fluxes were very small or close to zero during the night.
   The results further showed that the additional energy gain by sensible
   heat advection might have triggered enhanced evaporation for two sites
   during nighttime. Accounting for advective fluxes improved the energy
   balance closure for one of the three ADVEX sites. However, the energy
   balance closure of the other two sites did not improve overall. A
   comparison with energy balance residuals (energy missed by the
   measurements without accounting for advection) indicated a large
   influence of systematic errors. An inspection of the energy balance for
   the sloped site of the ADVEX dataset underlined the necessity of
   slope-parallel measurement of radiation.}},

Abstract = {{Electrocatalytic water splitting is considered an attractive way to
   achieve clean and sustainable energy production. Herein, a series of
   self-supported oxygen and molybdenum dual-doped cobalt phosphides grown
   on Ni foam (O,Mo-CoP/NFs) were prepared. The O,Mo-CoP/NFs exhibited 3D
   hierarchical morphologies including urchin-like nanostructures assembled
   with nanorods and nanoflowers assembled with ultrathin nanosheets. The
   optimized O,Mo-CoP/NFs-2 nanoflowers exhibited superior electrocatalytic
   performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen
   evolution reaction (OER), with an overpotential of only 59 mV at 10 mA
   cm(-2) for HER and 301 mV overpotential at 100 mA cm(-2) for OER.
   Moreover, the O,Mo-CoP/NFs-2 nanoflowers exhibited efficient overall
   water splitting as low as 1.66 V for 100 mA cm(-2) with outstanding
   long-term stability, even superior to the commercial Pt-C/NF and RuO2/NF
   system. The superior activity of self-supported O,Mo-CoP/NFs-2
   nanoflowers was attributed to the synergistic effect of O and Mo dual
   doping, which promoted its intrinsic catalytic activity, and its
   particular morphology of self-supported 3D hierarchical nanoflowers,
   which could expose more catalytic sites and enable facile gas escape.
   Moreover, the device of overall water splitting can be powered by a
   single AA battery or a 1.5 V solar cell, showing its great potential for
   practical applications.}},

Title = {{Exploring contraception myths and misconceptions among young men and
   women in Kwale County, Kenya}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundMyths and misconceptions around modern contraceptives have
   been associated with low contraceptive uptake in sub-Saharan Africa and
   Kenya in particular. Addressing persistent contraceptive knowledge gaps
   can make a significant contribution towards improved contraceptive
   uptake among young women. This qualitative study therefore sought to
   explore and understand young people's knowledge of modern contraception
   and to identify their key concerns regarding these methods.MethodsWe
   used focus group discussions (FGD) with vignette and writing activities
   to explore key myths and misconceptions around the use of
   contraceptives. Six FGDs (three for young men and three for young women)
   were conducted with a total of 28 young women and 30 young men from
   Kwale County, Kenya. We included 10 discussants aged 18-24 per FGD, one
   FGD had 8 participants. Predefined codes reflecting the discussion
   guides and emerging issues in the FGDs were used to develop the thematic
   coding framework. Our analysis followed a pattern of association on the
   key preset themes focusing on myths and misconceptions around
   contraceptive use.ResultsResults are presented under four key themes:
   awareness of contraception, myths and misconceptions around
   contraception, males' contraceptive narratives and young people's
   preferred sources of contraceptives. Both men and women participants
   reported basic awareness of contraceptives. A mixture of biological and
   social misconceptions were discussed and included perceptions that
   modern contraception: jeopardized future fertility, could result in
   problems conceiving or birth defects, made women promiscuous, was
   `un-African', and would deny couples their sexual freedom. Compared to
   female respondents in the study, young men appeared to be strong
   believers of the perceived socio-cultural effects of contraceptives. On
   preferred sources of contraceptives, respondents reported on two main
   sources, pharmacies and public hospitals, however, they could not agree
   on which one was suitable for them.ConclusionsThis study revealed the
   presence of a mixture of biological and social myths and misconceptions
   around contraception, with young men also strongly adhering to these
   misconceptions. The low level of contraceptive knowledge, particularly
   on contraceptive fears as revealed by the study demonstrate critical
   gaps in sexual and reproductive health (SRH) knowledge among young
   people. Improved SRH literacy to address contraceptives' fears through
   appropriate and gender specific interventions to reach out to young men
   and women with factual SRH information may therefore contribute to
   increased uptake of SRH services including modern contraceptive methods.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveRecently, we described a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 9
   (ADAM9) overexpression by Schwann cells of vestibular schwannoma (VS)
   and suggested that it might be a marker for VS tumor growth and
   invasiveness. This research note provides additional data utilizing a
   small cohort of VS primary cultures and tissue samples. We examined
   whether reconstitution of Merlin expression in VS cells regulates ADAM9
   protein expression and performed lentiviral ADAM9 knock down to
   investigate possible effects on VS cells numbers. Moreover, the
   co-localization of ADAM9 and Integrins alpha 6 and alpha 2 beta 1,
   respectively, was examined by immunofluorescence double
   staining.ResultsADAM9 expression was not regulated by Merlin in VS.
   However, ADAM9 knock down led to 58\% reduction in cell numbers in VS
   primary cell cultures (p<0.0001). While ADAM9 and Integrin <alpha>2 beta
   1 were co-localized in only 22\% (2 of 9) of VS, ADAM9 and Integrin
   alpha 6 were co-localized in 91\% (10 of 11) of VS. Therefore, we
   provide first observations on possible regulatory functions of ADAM9
   expression in VS.}},

Abstract = {{When managing epilepsy, there is a temptation to focus care with respect
   to the last and the next seizure. However, epilepsy is a multifaceted
   chronic condition and should be treated as such. Epilepsy comes with
   many physical risks, psychological effects, and socioeconomic
   ramifications, demanding a long-term commitment from the treating
   physician. Patients with epilepsy, compared to other chronically ill
   patient populations, have a worse quality of life, family function, and
   less social support. The majority of patients are well controlled on
   antiseizure drugs. However, approximately one-third will continue to
   have seizures despite optimized medical management. The primary aim of
   this article is to explore the long-term management of chronic epilepsy,
   and to address some of the particular needs of patients with chronic

Abstract = {{We explored the beneficial effects of GW7647, a peroxisome proliferator
   activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha) agonist, and metformin, an
   anti-diabetic drug on an advanced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)
   model in rodents and investigated the possible mechanisms involved. Mice
   were fed control chow or a choline-deficient l-amino acid-defined diet
   containing 45\% fat (HF-CDAA). The mice fed HF-CDAA diets for 16 weeks
   were divided into four groups: the no treatment (HF-CDAA), HF-CDAA
   containing 1000 mg/kg metformin, HF-CDAA containing 10 mg/kg GW7647, and
   HF-CDAA with both metformin and GW7647 groups. Metformin alone slightly
   deteriorated the aspartate and alanine aminotransferase (AST/ALT)
   values, whereas co-treatment with GW7647 and metformin greatly
   suppressed liver injury and fibrosis via activation of the AMP-activated
   protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. Further study revealed that co-treatment
   decreased the expression of inflammatory-, fibrogenesis-, and
   endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related genes and increased the
   oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)/reduced nicotinamide
   adenine dinucleotide (NADH) ratio, suggesting the superiority of
   co-treatment due to restoration of mitochondrial function. The additive
   benefits of a PPAR alpha agonist and metformin in a HF-CDAA diet-induced
   advanced NASH model was firstly demonstrated, possibly through
   restoration of mitochondrial function and AMPK activation, which finally
   resulted in suppression of hepatic inflammation, ER stress, then,
   fibrosis.}},

Abstract = {{The accurate recognition of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions is
   challenged by the high sensitivity and imperfect specificity of MRI. To
   examine whether longitudinal changes in volume, surface area,
   3-dimensional (3D) displacement (i.e. change in lesion position), and 3D
   deformation (i.e. change in lesion shape) could inform on the origin of
   supratentorial brain lesions, we prospectively enrolled 23 patients with
   MS and 11 patients with small vessel disease (SVD) and performed
   standardized 3-T 3D brain MRI studies. Bayesian linear mixed effects
   regression models were constructed to evaluate associations between
   changes in lesion morphology and disease state. A total of 248 MS and
   157 SVD lesions were studied. Individual MS lesions demonstrated
   significant decreases in volume<3.75mm(3) (p=0.04), greater shifts in 3D
   displacement by 23.4\% with increasing duration between MRI time points
   (p=0.007), and greater transitions to a more non-spherical shape
   (p<0.0001). If 62.2\% of lesions within a given MRI study had a
   calculated theoretical radius>2.49 based on deviation from a perfect 3D
   sphere, a 92.7\% in-sample and 91.2\% out-of-sample accuracy was
   identified for the diagnosis of MS. Longitudinal 3D shape evolution and
   displacement characteristics may improve lesion classification, adding
   to MRI techniques aimed at improving lesion specificity.}},

   The effect of cyclic heating and cooling on various soil properties

   increased. CBR increased with repeated heating and cooling up to 23.5\%.
   A percentage decrease in liquid limit up to 25\% was recorded while
   plastic limit and plasticity index reduced in all samples. Increase in
   CBR is an indication of increase in strength with repeated heating while
   the decrease in MDD is an indication of reduced density on account of
   increase in OMC of the soil samples with repeated heating.}},

Abstract = {{Existing literature has examined the contextual effects on individual
   environmental activism, but little research has been conducted to
   investigate how local-level governance factors affect individual
   environmental activism, particularly in developing countries. This paper
   investigates the moderating effects of local government transparency and
   responsiveness on the motivation-activism relationship in China. We
   compiled a provincial-level database capturing local government
   transparency and responsiveness and combined this with data from the
   China General Social Survey 2013. Multilevel modeling analysis revealed
   that motivation factors at the individual level have stronger effects on
   individual engagement in environmental activism when government
   transparency and responsiveness are more encouraging at the provincial
   level. The results not only point to local governance as a contextual
   factor for understanding individual environmental activism in China but
   also highlight the need to consider the interactions of individuals in
   the political context to understand how individual factors translate
   into environmental activism in many developing countries.}},

Title = {{Expression of cannabinoid and cannabinoid-related receptors in the oral

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FELINE MEDICINE AND SURGERY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{23}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objectives
   Feline chronic gingivostomatitis (FCGS) is an oral disease. Cats with
   FCGS experience intense oral pain. Some cats remain refractory to
   current therapies based on dental extraction and adjuvant medical
   treatment; it is therefore necessary to investigate alternative
   therapeutic targets involved in inflammatory mechanisms and pain, namely
   the endocannabinoid system (ECS). The present study investigated the
   expression of cannabinoid receptors type 1 (CB1R) and 2 (CB2R), and
   cannabinoid-related receptors G protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55),
   transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) and serotonin 1a receptor
   (5-HT1aR), in the oral mucosa of healthy cats to determine whether there
   was altered expression and distribution in cats with FCGS.
   Methods
   Samples of caudal oral mucosa were collected from eight control cats
   (CTRL cats) and from eight cats with FCGS (FCGS cats). Tissue samples
   were processed using an immunofluorescence assay with cat-specific
   antibodies, and the immunolabelling of the receptors studied was
   semiquantitatively evaluated.
   Results
   The mucosal epithelium of the CTRL cats showed CB1R, TRPA1 and 5-HT1aR
   immunoreactivity (IR), while CB2R and GPR55 IR were generally not
   expressed. In the CTRL cats, the subepithelial inflammatory cells
   expressed CB2R, GPR55 and 5-HT1aR IR. In the FCGS cats, all the
   receptors studied were markedly upregulated in the epithelium and
   inflammatory infiltrate.
   Conclusions and relevance
   Cannabinoid and cannabinoid-related receptors are widely expressed in
   the oral mucosa of healthy cats and are upregulated during the course of
   FCGS. The presence of cannabinoid and cannabinoid-related receptors in
   healthy tissues suggests the possible role of the ECS in the homeostasis
   of the feline oral mucosa, while their overexpression in the inflamed
   tissues of FCGS cats suggests the involvement of the ECS in the
   pathogenesis of this disease, with a possible role in the related
   inflammation and pain. Based on the present findings, ECS could be
   considered a potential therapeutic target for patients with FCGS.}},

Abstract = {{Software development effort estimation plays a crucial role in the
   successful completion of any software development project. Estimating
   the software development effort accurately is one of the challenges in
   the software industry. In this paper a soft computing technique named
   Meta Cognitive sequential learning is used to improve the software
   development effort estimate of a software project. Different datasets
   namely, Deshernais, NASA, Kitchenham, Maxwell, Telecom, IBM, Kemerer,
   Hallmark and ISBSG are used in the training and testing of the
   estimation process. The performance comparison of the former method is
   compared with other methods such as Particle swarm optimization, Genetic
   Algorithm and Back propagation network using Mean magnitude of relative
   error (MMRE) parameter. It is found that the MMRE of Meta cognitive
   neuro fuzzy method is less than the MMRE of other methods taken for
   comparison. Thus the Meta cognitive neuro fuzzy method can produce a
   better estimate of the software development effort and hence can produce
   an estimate with much precision to the actual effort.}},

Title = {{Red deer allocate vigilance differently in response to spatio-temporal
   patterns of risk from human hunters and wolves}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{163-174}},
Abstract = {{Context. Ungulate prey can use increased vigilance to reduce their risk
   of predation, but little is known of the combined and interactive risk
   effects from humans and wolves in determining ungulate behaviour across
   time and space. Understanding the interplay between these risk effects
   is increasingly important, considering the recolonisation of several
   large carnivores to more human-dominated landscapes in Europe.
   Aim. The aim of the present study was to assess the vigilance behaviour
   expressed by red deer (Cervus elaphus) in response to both humans and
   wolves in the Polish Bialowiez. a Forest.
   Methods. Using a camera-trap transect, the effect of distance to human
   settlements, hunting season, patterns of space use by wolves (Canis
   lupus), canopy openness, canopy height, time of day, as well as sex/age
   of individuals, on the vigilance behaviour observed in red deer was
   studied using a model-selection approach.
   Key results. We did not find a clear effect of patterns of space use by
   wolves or distance to human settlements on red deer vigilance behaviour
   at the landscape scale. However, red deer showed increased vigilance
   during the hunting season and during the day outside of protected areas
   and reserves, because disturbance from human hunters is highest.
   Conversely, we also found that red deer were more vigilant at night
   within more protected areas, which is likely to be explained by the
   increased activity of wolves because human activity is strictly limited.
   Conclusions. Our study showed that vigilance behaviour of red deer in
   Bialowiez. a Primeval Forest is more driven by human hunting than by the
   frequency of wolf presence at a landscape scale. This could be explained
   by the higher temporal and spatial predictability of human hunting
   activities than wolf risk. We found that patterns of wolf space use, as
   opposed to the omnipresent fear effects from humans, had only localised
   effects by increasing vigilance levels during night hours in non-hunting
   areas of the forest. The reverse was observed outside of protected
   reserves. Understanding how prey species respond to this new combination
   of risk from natural predators and humans, is increasingly important in
   a landscape where human risk is becoming ever more potent and carnivores
   recolonise.}},

Abstract = {{Artisanal and Small-scale Gold Mining (ASGM) is one of the main sources
   of global Hg emissions and is present over a wide territorial in the
   southern Amazonia. In this region, there is a rapid approximation
   between agricultural and livestock activities and the impact of this
   close proximity having little or no evaluation. Thus, we have determined
   the Hg concentration in soybean plants in an area with ASGMs activities.
   The concentration of Hg in plants was higher in the vicinity of the
   ASGMs, where the Hg leaf concentration was three times higher,
   suggesting a higher atmospheric metal deposition in this area. It is
   estimated that atmospheric Hg deposition in the vicinity of ASGMs of up
   to 6.94 g km(-2) during the contact time between leaves and atmosphere.
   The translocation and bioaccumulation factors reinforce the effect of
   atmospheric Hg deposition, mainly, in the leaves. No impact was observed
   on the edible part of the plant due to the proximity of the ASGMs. It
   can be inferred that our results point to considerable rates of Hg

Abstract = {{Educational pressures such as challenging workload, demanding deadlines
   and competitiveness among undergraduate dental students erode academic
   integrity in clinical training. The implementation of honour codes have
   been associated with the reduction in academic dishonesty. An action
   research was undertaken to investigate and foster academic integrity
   through creative pedagogical strategies and the implementation of an
   honour code within the undergraduate dental programme. Students reported
   the honour code as relevant (86.3\%) and it encouraged (> 92\%) the five
   investigated fundamental values of academic integrity (International
   Centre of Academic Integrity). The students also favoured (86.3\%) the
   annual implementation of the honour code. The creative pedagogical
   strategy facilitated a change in perception on academic integrity in the
   clinical scenarios sessions. Most students (85.7\%) showed changes in
   perception of academic integrity. The majority of students'
   narratives/responses were positive and the emerging subthemes also
   espoused the five out of the six ICAI fundamental values of academic
   integrity. Students indicated the need for inclusion of academic
   integrity education within the curriculum. They felt that staff also
   should be guided by an academic integrity policy. Implementation of an
   honour code coupled with creative pedagogical strategies helped to
   foster understanding and appreciation for academic integrity. Conversely
   the honour code implementation was more effective due to the use of
   supportive creative pedagogical strategies on academic integrity. It is
   still undetermined whether these change in perception impacted on
   clinical practice during training and post-graduation.}},

Abstract = {{The main purpose of the article is to examine the changes in migration

   made of the main decrees issued since 2018 and is supported by
   quantitative sources on flows and visas granted until August 2020. The
   text shows how the government uses migratory diplomacy as a central
   element of its foreign policy both to get closer to Washington's agenda,
   to move away from the Bolivarian axis-mainly from the Venezuelan
   government-and to obtain funds from international cooperation to face
   the increase of migrants.}},

Abstract = {{Spectroscopic Imaging Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (SI-STM)
   measurements have previously been applied to the study of the
   heavy-fermion system CeCoIn5 to examine the superconducting gap
   structure and band dispersions via quasiparticle intereference. Here we
   directly measure the dispersing electron bands with angle-resolved
   photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) and compare with first-principles
   electronic structure calculations. By autocorrelating the ARPES-resolved
   bands with themselves we can measure the potential q vectors and discern
   exactly which bands the STM is measuring. We find that the STM results
   are dominated by scattering associated with a cloverleaf shaped band
   centered at the zone corners. This same band is also a viable candidate
   to host the superconducting gap. The electronic structure calculations
   indicate that this region of the Fermi surface involves significant
   contributions from the Co d electrons, an indication that the
   superconductivity in these materials is more three dimensional than that
   found in the related unconventional superconductors, the cuprates and
   the pnictides.}},

   coir pith}},
Journal = {{NATURAL PRODUCT RESEARCH}},
Abstract = {{Coir pith, an agro-industrial residue, is resistant to natural
   degradation, and its accumulation causes environmental pollution.
   Ferulic acid, a precursor of vanillin, was extracted from the raw coir
   pith by chemical pre-treatment such as alkaline hydrolysis,
   acidification, and liquid-liquid extraction method. The obtained ferulic
   acid (1.2 g/50 g) was analysed using high-performance liquid
   chromatography (HPLC) and used as a substrate for biotransformation by
   Aspergillus niger to vanillic acid, which, in turn, was fermented by
   using Phanerochaete chrysosporium to vanillin. The quantity of vanillic
   acid detected by HPLC on the third day of incubation was 0.773 g/L,
   while the optimal yield of vanillin on the subsequent third day of
   incubation was 0.628 g/L. Thus, the chemical extraction of ferulic acid
   from coir pith ensued bioconversion into vanillin. These products are
   highly valuable and economical to be used in industries such as
   pharmaceuticals, health, cosmetics, and neutraceuticals.}},

Journal = {{NEURORADIOLOGY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{99-104}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The aim of this study was to depict the signal intensity
   pattern of the normal oculomotor nerve demonstrated on contrast-enhanced
   three-dimensional fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images.
   Materials and methods: Eighty-one patients were included in the study.
   Contrast-enhanced three-dimensional fluid-attenuated inversion recovery
   images with magnetisation-prepared rapid acquisition were reconstructed
   and evaluated in the coronal plane. The signal intensity of the
   cisternal segment of the oculomotor nerve was graded into a visual scale
   of 1 to 5 as compared to the white matter, grey matter and the pituitary
   stalk. The signal intensity ratio of the oculomotor nerve was
   consequently measured.
   Results: By using the visual scale, more than half of the oculomotor
   nerves showed higher signal intensity than the grey matter signal on
   contrast-enhanced three-dimensional fluid-attenuated inversion recovery
   images (59.3-80.2\%). It can demonstrate a signal intensity similar to
   the pituitary stalk (14.8\%) by visualisation. None of them showed
   signal intensity equal to the normal white matter signal. By signal
   intensity measurement, the mean signal intensity ratio of oculomotor
   nerves to white matter equals 1.54 +/- 0.20 (95\% confidence interval
   (CI) 1.51 1.57); mean signal intensity ratio to grey matter equals 1.16
   +/- 0.15 (95\% CI 1.14 1.18); mean signal intensity ratio to the
   pituitary stalk equals 0.68 +/- 0.10 (95\% CI 0.64 0.70).
   Conclusions: The normal oculomotor nerve visualised on contrast-enhanced
   three-dimensional fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images has a
   higher signal intensity than the white matter and may have a signal
   intensity similar to the grey matter or the pituitary stalk. The high
   signal intensity of the oculomotor nerve in contrast-enhanced
   three-dimensional fluid-attenuated inversion recovery should not be
   misinterpreted as a pathology.}},

Abstract = {{The surface of nanowires is a source of interest mainly for electrical
   prospects. Thus, different surface chemical treatments were carried out
   to develop recipes to control the surface effect. In this work, we
   succeed in shifting and tuning the semiconductivity of a Si
   nanowire-based device from n- to p-type. This was accomplished by
   generating a hole transport layer at the surface by using an
   electrochemical reaction-based nonequilibrium position to enhance the
   impact of the surface charge transfer. This was completed by applying
   different annealing pulses at low temperature (below 400 degrees C) to
   reserve the hydrogen bonds at the surface. After each annealing pulse,
   the surface was characterized by XPS, Kelvin probe measurements, and
   conductivity measured by FET based on a single Si NW. The mechanism and
   conclusion were supported experimentally and theoretically. To this end,
   this strategy has been demonstrated as an essential tool which could
   pave a new road for regulating semiconductivity and for other
   low-dimensional nanomaterials.}},

Abstract = {{Anxiety sensitivity is a potential risk factor for posttraumatic stress
   symptoms (PTSS) and has been hypothesized to contribute to PTSS
   development. However, few prospective studies have evaluated whether
   anxiety sensitivity predicts PTSS. In a subsample of 48 women sexual
   assault survivors enrolled as part of a larger prospective observational
   study, elevated anxiety sensitivity measured via a brief assessment 1
   week after experiencing a sexual assault was concurrently associated
   with PTSS at 1 week and prospectively predicted PTSS 6 weeks after the
   event, with small-to-medium effect sizes, eta(2)(p) = .10, even after
   covarying for trauma history. Heightened anxiety sensitivity at 1-week
   postevent also interacted with time to predict anxiety and depression
   both before and after sexual assault, with medium-to-large effect sizes,
   eta(2)(p) = .21- .24. This is consistent with research linking anxiety
   sensitivity to PTSS, but this was the first prospective study of which
   we are aware to demonstrate that anxiety sensitivity in the acute
   posttrauma period predicts PTSS among women who have recently
   experienced sexual assault. Future research should use the full Anxiety
   Sensitivity Index to replicate findings in a larger sample and explore
   whether targeting anxiety sensitivity could mitigate the development of
   PTSS in this vulnerable population.}},

Abstract = {{Indigenous claims ``to speak the law{''} in Guatemala extend far beyond
   late twentieth-century statist proposals for multicultural legal orders
   based on recognition of legal pluralism. Drawing on collaborative
   research with the Indigenous Mayoralty of Santa Cruz del Quiche and
   examination of public debates in the media, this article analyzes
   attempts to ensure the legibility of Indigenous law, including disputes
   over constitutional reforms in 2016 and 2017. It suggests how different
   conceptual framings shape methodological approaches and representations
   of law. While opponents of Indigenous jurisdiction frame Mayan law as
   violent and illegal, and thus radically incommensurable with the
   national legal order, for Indigenous authorities ``speaking the law{''}
   is not about seeking recognition from the nation-state. Rather,
   ``speaking the law{''} is about communitarian forms of sovereignty and
   legality rooted in Mayan languages and cosmologies. Countering
   racialized tropes, Mayan authorities' representations allude to
   understandings of justice and forms of legitimacy that existed prior to
   the sovereign state and national and international laws. In this way
   they highlight not only the historical violence of the Guatemalan state
   but also the foundational violence of law itself, pointing to
   temporalities and ontologies of justice beyond modernist legal frames.}},

Abstract = {{Salt stress is a major abiotic factor that affects the growth and yield
   of crops. The present study was carried out to assess the salt tolerance
   among the Arka Samrat, Arka Rakshak, YVU-1, S-22, YVU-2, and PKM-OP
   tomato germplasms using principal component analysis (PCA). Different
   salt (NaCl) concentrations like control, 0.04 M, 0.12 M, and 0.20 M were
   selected in order to classify them into sensitive and tolerant tomato
   germplasms based on 13 parameters. A significant variation was observed
   among the selected tomato germplasms towards salinity tolerance at the
   seedling stage. Shoot length, root length, fresh weight, and dry weight
   parameters of the seedlings were decreased linearly with an increase in
   the external NaCl concentration. Salinization of plants has shown to
   reduce K+ content and increase in the Na+ accumulation, Ca2+, and
   Catalase activity. Salt stress also increased electrolyte leakage and
   reduced relative water content of all germplasms. The maximum parameters
   were less affected in Arka Rakshak and Arka Samrat compared to the
   remaining germplasms at higher salt stress. The PCA analysis of 13
   morphological and physiological variables indicated that Arka Rakshak
   and Arka Samrat germplasms were salt-tolerant and PKM-OP was
   susceptible. Thus PCA analysis results are useful for the identification
   of resistance and sensitive germplasms at the seedling stage.}},

Abstract = {{We study the process of high-pressure water spraying of powders of
   austenitic stainless steels in a small-scale installation with a furnace
   capacity of 25 kg. The technological characteristics of the obtained
   powders are analyzed depending on the conditions of spraying. It is
   shown that, as the ratio of the amounts of high-pressure water and
   sprayed metal melt increases, the shapes of formed particles change from
   rounded and even spherical to irregular and spongy with highly developed
   surfaces. This effect is explained by an increase in the rate of cooling
   of formed particles, which prevents the possibility of their
   spheroidization in the course of motion from the focus of spraying to
   the level of cooling water in the chamber. Hence, by changing the ratio
   of the amounts of high-pressure water to the amount of the melt, we can
   get high-quality powders of prescribed shapes. These powders can be used
   in various fields of the contemporary industry.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Prior studies demonstrate elevated cortical glutamate (Glu)
   in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). Studies assessing neurochemistry
   in early stages of bipolar illness before the emergence of manic
   symptoms are lacking. This study aimed to examine neurochemical
   correlates measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1-MRS)
   and a dimensional measure of bipolarity in a sample of depressed
   adolescents.
   Methods: Adolescent participants (aged 13-21 years) underwent a
   semistructured diagnostic interview and clinical assessment, which
   included the General Behavior Inventory Parent Version (P-GBI), a
   73-item, parent-rated assessment of symptoms and behaviors. H-1-MRS
   scans of a left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) voxel (8 cm(3))
   were collected using a two-dimensional J-averaged sequence to assess
   N-acetylaspartate (NAA), Glu, Glx (glutamate + glutamine), and NAA/Glx
   concentrations. We used generalized linear models to assess the
   relationships between P-GBI scores and metabolite levels in L-DLPFC.
   Results: Thirty-six participants (17 healthy controls, 19 depressed)
   underwent H-1-MRS scans and clinical evaluation with the P-GBI. There
   was a significant negative relationship between P-GBI score and L-DLPFC
   NAA/Glx in the whole sample. However, the magnitude of the effect was
   small and statistical significance was lost after correcting for
   multiple comparisons.
   Conclusions: These preliminary results suggest that NAA/Glx may have
   utility as a marker of bipolar traits in healthy and depressed
   adolescents. If replicated, H-1-MRS measures of glutamatergic metabolism
   anomalies might have a role in identifying depressed adolescents at risk
   for mixed symptom presentations or BD. Identifying bipolarity in the
   early stages of the disease would have a significant impact on treatment
   planning and prognosis. Further longitudinal studies should examine
   neurochemical correlates of mood state during the developmental
   emergence of BD.}},

Journal = {{INLAND WATERS}},
Abstract = {{The ecosystem services provided by large, complex freshwater systems
   have long been subjected to various stresses by humans; drinking water,
   transport, manufacturing, and even recreation have been impaired in
   different ways. How can these systems be managed to protect their health
   and services for present and future generations? We discuss the
   jurisdiction, stressors, and examples of preventative management, as
   well as future needs, for 2 iconic North American freshwater systems:
   (1) the Laurentian Great Lakes, an international system of lakes and
   waterways that comprise similar to 21\% of the world's surface fresh
   water; and (2) the Florida Everglades, an ecosystem consisting of lakes,
   rivers, freshwater wetlands, estuaries, and marine bays, located in
   south Florida, and which have been heavily modified. Billions of dollars
   are being invested in restoration projects in both ecosystems. Despite
   differences in size, governance structure, and impairments, the
   overriding needs associated with large-scale ecosystem protection and
   restoration result in similar recommendations for the preventative
   management of these 2 systems: a robust monitoring network; early
   warning and detection systems; and effective enforcement of regulations.}},

Abstract = {{In a randomized trial, higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality was
   observed in treatment with febuxostat than with allopurinol in patients
   with coexisting gout and serious cardiovascular conditions. In this
   study, we focus on an intervention of febuxostat or allopurinol as an
   anti-inflammatory treatment to reduce the transcription of nuclear
   factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) and production of relevant inflammatory
   factors. We evaluated the effect of febuxostat on vascular cell adhesion
   protein 1 (VCAM-1) induction in cultured human umbilical vein
   endothelial cells (HUVECs). Cells were exposed to tumor necrosis factor
   (TNF)-alpha (10 ng/mL) treatment for 24 h. Febuxostat or allopurinol
   (0.1-100 mu M) was added to the bath medium 15 min before TNF-alpha
   treatment. VCAM-1 levels in HUVECs increased after 24-h TNF-alpha
   treatment (n = 4). Febuxostat and allopurinol significantly suppressed
   VCAM-1 induced by treatment with TNF-alpha in a dose-dependent manner (p
   < 0.05, n = 4). Furthermore, these drugs suppressed the NF-kappa B
   protein levels in the nucleus 4 h after TNF-alpha treatment (n = 3 or
   4). Our results suggest that TNF-alpha induces VCAM-1 production via
   NF-kappa B, which can be blocked by febuxostat or allopurinol. The
   effect of febuxostat treatment on cardiovascular events may be
   associated with protection against the infiltration of lymphocytes or
   monocytes through VCAM-1 induction in inflamed endothelial cells such as
   arterial sclerosis.}},

   hemorrhage: two case reports}},
Journal = {{BMC PEDIATRICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},

Month = {{NOV 11}},
Abstract = {{Background Intraventricular hemorrhage during the early stage is a major
   complication in very low birth weight infants. Elevation of venous
   pressure is one of the contributing factors. The internal cerebral vein
   receives most of the venous flow from the subependymal germinal matrix,
   the most common site of origin of intraventricular hemorrhage. Recently,
   it has been reported that pulsatile or partially interrupted internal
   cerebral vein waveforms might also be risk factors for intraventricular
   hemorrhage in extremely low birth weight infants. Here, we report two
   cases of partially reversed internal cerebral vein flow with
   intraventricular hemorrhage. There are no published reports documenting
   this unique flow pattern. Case presentation Between 2013 and 2020, we
   had in our neonatal intensive care unit two cases of very low birth
   weight infants (27 and 25 weeks of gestational age) who showed a
   partially reversed internal cerebral vein waveform pattern, which was
   recognized as a new blood flow pattern. Their internal cerebral vein
   flow patterns were continuously flat early after birth. They showed an
   intraventricular hemorrhage on the unilateral side with partially
   interrupted internal cerebral vein flow at 31 and 41 hours after birth
   (27- and 25-week-old neonates, respectively). Consecutively, their
   internal cerebral vein flow changed to a partially reversed pattern with
   intraventricular hemorrhage on the contralateral side at 43 and 87 hours
   after birth (27- and 25-week-old neonates, respectively). Their flow
   patterns improved by day 7. These partially reversed patterns were
   equivalent to triphasic venous flow, and the reverse flow corresponded
   to A- and V-waves. Conclusion In the two cases, the internal cerebral
   vein flow patterns were normal and flat before intraventricular
   hemorrhage and changed to a severe flow pattern (partially interrupted
   or reversed flow) at the same time as the detection of intraventricular
   hemorrhage. After the development of intraventricular hemorrhage, they
   improved. These cases indicate that a partially reversed or interrupted
   internal cerebral vein flow pattern may be derived from central venous
   pressure elevation and related to intraventricular hemorrhage in very
   low birth weight infants, however, it is difficult to determine when
   this flow pattern occurs in relation to intraventricular hemorrhage.}},

Title = {{Resilience as the predictor of quality of life in the infertile couples
   as the most neglected and silent minorities}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF REPRODUCTIVE AND INFANT PSYCHOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Background: It has been demonstrated that infertility can affect quality
   of life (QoL) in infertile couples. Resilience is considered a
   protective factor against the distress caused by infertility and the
   quality of life status. There is a new definition for Fertility Quality
   of Life that evaluates particularly the impact of infertility on various
   aspects of life.
   Material and methods: In this couple-based study, the main objective was
   investigating the quality of life based on the gender and resilience of
   infertile couples. Measurement tools were three questionnaires including
   a demographic one, a quality of life of infertile couples questionnaire
   and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. Data analysis was done through
   paired t-test and linear multiple regressions test.
   Results: Overall the difference of mean score for QoL is statistically
   significant (P > 0.001) between men and women (69.48\% vs 58.87\%),
   which means that QoL status was positive in men and neutral in women. In
   addition, the mean score of male resilience was more than female
   resilience (P = 0.009). The results showed there was a significant and
   positive correlation between the QoL status and resilience score (P =
   0.008, r = 0.13) (P < 0.1), and resilience (beta = 0.04 and P = 0.04)
   had a significant protective effect on the quality of life.
   Conclusion: Low resilience status in infertile couples is better to be
   considered as a risk factor compromising the quality of life and
   infertility consolers should keep in mind this issue and provide a
   comprehensive and holistic approach for a better outcome of infertility
   treatment.}},

   activity}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR STRUCTURE \& DYNAMICS}},
Abstract = {{HIV-1 infection is a global epidemic whose treatment is limited majorly
   by viral resistance and adverse effects. Natural products from algae
   have been studied for many years, including antiviral, being an
   alternative to anti-HIV drug design. Since the isolation of natural
   products can be a hurdle, molecular modeling is an important tool to
   study these compounds. Herein, structure-activity relationship,
   molecular docking, and molecular dynamic studies were performed to
   direct the studies of ten marine natural products with anti-HIV
   activity. In the structure-activity relationship, descriptors were
   identified associating the anti-HIV activity of five diterpenes with
   possible action on the reverse transcriptase allosteric site. These
   diterpenes were evaluated by molecular docking, and it was identified
   that only dolabelladienetriol interacted in the allosteric site.
   Molecular dynamics suggested that the dolabelladienetriol might
   interfere with the viral RNA binding to HIV-1 RT by inducing a
   conformational change of the enzyme. Also, in silico ADMET simulations
   predicts that the dolabelladienetriol present a high potential to be
   successfully developed as a drug. Thus, applying in silico approaches
   was possible to suggest potential anti-HIV compounds derived from marine
   natural products.

Title = {{Effect of Basketball Sports on Serum Superoxide Dismutase and Its
   Relationship with the Nanoparticle Drug Delivery System}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Human survival is impossible without oxygen, and as the body load
   continues to increase, the need for oxygen intake becomes greater.
   However, oxygen is also a double-edged sword for the human body. A large
   number of studies have proved that excessive intake of oxygen might lead
   to oxygen poisoning. Even under normal oxygen uptake, there is still a
   certain proportion of SOD conversion in oxygen. Superoxide dismutase
   (SOD) is one of the main causes of oxygen poisoning and chronic
   diseases. It is of great significance to study the changes of SOD in a
   large amount of oxygen environment. However, there are a few research
   studies in this field at home and abroad. Therefore, this paper puts
   forward the influence of basketball sports on serum superoxide dismutase
   (SOD) and its relationship with the nanoparticle drug delivery system.
   The research of this paper is mainly divided into three parts. The first
   part is the research of theoretical basis and core concepts. Through
   this part of the study, this paper shows that exercise can make the
   human body strong, while controlling the transformation of SOD, and only
   in this way can we achieve the true meaning of sports health. The second
   part is the establishment method of the test model of the influence of
   basketball on SOD and the nanoparticle drug delivery system. In this
   part, the principle and operation steps of the design method are given
   in detail. In order to ensure the effect of the experiment, the test
   standard was established, and the whole process data were recorded for
   the retrospective study. The third part is the comparative experiment,
   which includes the influence of different exercise intensities on SOD
   activity and the preservation stability of nanoparticles. Through the
   analysis of experimental data, it was found that basketball increased
   the risk of SOD transformation, but at the same time, using
   nanoparticles intervention can effectively reduce the harm of SOD to the
   human body.}},

Abstract = {{To feed an increasingly affluent population, reactive nitrogen (Nr)
   inputs to China's lands and waters have substantially increased over the
   past century. Today, China's Nr emissions account for over one third of
   global total emissions, leading to serious environmental pollution and
   health damages. Quantifying the spatial variability of Nr inputs is
   crucial for the identification of intervention points to mitigate Nr
   pollution, which, however, is not well known. Here, we present a
   database describing Nr inputs to China for the year 2017 with a 1 km x 1
   km resolution, considering land use and Nr sources, compiled by using
   the CHANS model. Results show that the North China Plain, the Sichuan
   Basin and the Middle-Lower Yangtze River Plain are hotspots of Nr
   inputs, where per hectare Nr input is an order of magnitude higher than
   that in other regions. Cropland and surface water bodies receive much
   higher Nr inputs than other land use types. This unique database will
   provide basic data for research on environmental health and global

Abstract = {{In our previous study, cinnamtannin D1 (CD-1), one of the A-type
   procyanidin oligomers isolated from Cinnamomum tamala, was reported to
   have the activity of antiapoptosis in palmitic acid-treated pancreatic
   beta cells via alleviating oxidative stress in vitro. In this study, the
   aim was to further disclose its protective effect and underlying
   mechanisms against glucolipotoxicity-induced beta-cells apoptosis in
   vitro and in vivo. We found that CD-1 was able to dose-dependently and
   time-dependently activate autophagy in INS-1 pancreatic beta-cells. High
   glucose and palmitic acid (HG/PA)-induced apoptosis and autophagy
   impairment could be attenuated by CD-1 in INS-1 cells as well as primary
   cultured murine islets. We also demonstrated that CD-1-induced autophagy
   was through AMPK/mTOR/ULK1 pathway. Moreover, it was shown that the
   effects of CD-1 on activation of Keap1/Nrf2 antioxidant signaling
   pathway and the amelioration of inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum
   stress, and apoptosis were through autophagy induction in HG/PA-treated
   INS-1 cells. These protective effects in vivo and hypoglycemic activity
   of CD-1 were also observed in diabetic db/db mice. These findings have
   great significance in revealing the antidiabetic mechanisms of
   procyanidin oligomers and paving the way for their application in the
   treatment of diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Myoglobin clearance in acute kidney injury requiring renal
   replacement therapy is important because myoglobin has direct renal
   toxic effects. Clinical data comparing different modalities of renal
   replacement therapy addressing myoglobin clearance are limited. This
   study aimed to compare two renal replacement modalities regarding
   myoglobin clearance.
   Methods: In this prospective, randomized, single-blinded, single-center
   trial, 70 critically ill patients requiring renal replacement therapy
   were randomized 1:1 into an intervention arm using continuous
   veno-venous hemodialysis with high cutoff dialyzer and a control arm
   using continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration postdilution with
   high-flux dialyzer. Regional citrate anticoagulation was used in both
   groups to maintain the extracorporeal circuit. The concentrations of
   myoglobin, urea, creatinine, beta 2-microglobulin, interleukin-6 and
   albumin were measured before and after the dialyzer at 1 h, 6 h, 12 h,
   24 h and 48 h after initiating continuous renal replacement therapy.
   Results: Thirty-three patients were allocated to the control arm (CVVHDF
   with high-flux dialyzer) and 35 patients to the intervention arm (CVVHD
   with high cutoff dialyzer). Myoglobin clearance, as a primary endpoint,
   was significantly better in the intervention arm than in the control arm
   throughout the whole study period. The clearance values for urea and
   creatinine were higher in the control arm. There was no measurable
   albumin clearance in both arms. The clearance data for
   beta(2)-microglobulin and interleukin-6 were non-inferior in the
   intervention arm compared to those for the control arm. Dialyzer
   lifespan was 57.0 {[}38.0, 72.0] hours in the control arm and 70.0
   {[}56.75, 72.0] hours in the intervention arm (p = 0.029).
   Conclusions: Myoglobin clearance using continuous veno-venous
   hemodialysis with high cutoff dialyzer and regional citrate
   anticoagulation is better than that with continuous veno-venous
   hemodiafiltration with regional citrate anticoagulation.}},

Abstract = {{In the modern era of precision medicine, a number of class II
   immunohistochemistry (IHC) biomarkers are routinely tested in pathologic
   laboratories to select cancer patients who may be candidates for
   hormonal, targeted, and immune therapies. Pre-analytical factors,
   including tissue processing, are critical components of biomarker
   testing and require validation to ensure reliable results. In this
   study, we aimed to study the impact of tissue processing on biomarkers
   (including ER, PR, HER2, mismatch repair (MMR) proteins, BRAF V600E, and
   PD-L1) in a large prospective cohort of 109 tumors. We found that ER and
   MMR were not impacted; PR, HER2, and BRAF V600E were minimally affected;
   and PD-L1 regardless of the antibody clone was strongly influenced by a
   combination of tissue processing procedures and intratumoral
   heterogeneity. Our findings suggest that validation of pre-analytical
   parameters, such as tissue processing, is important for certain class II
   biomarkers, in particular PD-L1 IHC.}},

Abstract = {{Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) transcription drives cell growth and cell
   proliferation via the product ribosomal RNA (rRNA), the essential
   component of ribosome. Given the fundamental role of rRNA in ribosome
   biogenesis, rDNA transcription has emerged as one of the effective
   targets for a number of human diseases including various types of
   cancers. In this study, we identify curcumin, an ancient drug, as a
   novel natural inhibitor of rDNA transcription. Curcumin treatment
   impairs the assembly of the RNA polymerase I preinitiation complex at
   rDNA promoters and represses rDNA promoter activity, which leads to the
   decrease of rRNA synthesis. In addition, curcumin treatment stimulates
   autophagosome formation and promotes autophagic degradation in cells.
   Mechanistically, curcumin inactivates the mechanistic target of
   rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), the upstream regulator of rDNA
   transcription and autophagy induction, by inhibiting mTOR lysosomal
   localization. Functionally, curcumin treatment inhibits protein
   synthesis, cell growth and cell proliferation. Taken together, these
   findings identify curcumin as an effective inhibitor of rDNA
   transcription and provide novel mechanisms for the anticancer properties
   of curcumin.}},

Abstract = {{The usefulness of the oscillometry, known as forced oscillation
   technique, for predicting exercise tolerance in subjects with COPD is
   unknown. To test the hypothesis, we investigated whether oscillometry
   could predict a 6-minute walking distance (6MWD) <350 m in the 6-minute
   walk test (6MWT).
   This was a prospective, observational study. Fifty-seven subjects with
   COPD who attended outpatient clinics for routine checkups at Shizuoka
   General Hospital between April 2015 and April 2016 (54 males; median
   age, 70 years; and \%FEV1, 61.0\%). Modified MRC dyspnea scale (mMRC),
   COPD Assessment Test (CAT), oscillometry, spirometry, and 6MWT were
   performed in a stable condition. The participants were classified into
   subjects with 6MWD >= 350 m or 6MWD <350 m, and the predictor of 6MWD
   <350 m was assessed.
   Of the 57 total subjects, 43 (75.4\%) had a 6MWD >= 350 m, and 14
   (24.6\%) had a 6MWD <350 m. Between the two groups, there were
   significant differences in mMRC scale, GOLD stages, CAT scores, FEV1,
   IC, 6MWD, lowest SpO(2), maximum Borg scale, respiratory resistance
   (Rrs), and reactance (Xrs). In multivariate regression analysis, a 6MWD
   <350 m was independently predicted by CAT scores (OR 1.15, 95\% CI:
   1.01-1.30) and inspiratory R5 (OR 6.01, 95\% CI: 1.09-33.30). In
   receiver operating characteristic curves, the area under the curve was
   0.76, 0.78, and 0.85 for CAT scores, R5, and CAT scores + R5,
   respectively, with the best cutoff value of 17 and 2.82 cmH(2)0/L/s. In
   conclusion, the oscillatory parameter, inspiratory R5, predicted low
   exercise tolerance in COPD subjects.}},

Abstract = {{Indoor space, where humans spend 80\% of their lives, is subject to
   frequent out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Optimizing the spatial
   deployment of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) has the potential
   to improve OHCA survival rate. Complex indoor space is typically divided
   by hard barriers into multiple discrete subspaces across floors.
   Commonly used distance measurements, such as Euclidean distance and
   network distance, are unsuitable for indoor AED deployment. Instead, we
   propose an accessibility spatial search algorithm (ASSA) to generate
   accessible areas of candidate facilities, i.e. AEDs, based on an indoor
   space model, and optimizes the facility deployment subject to three
   objectives: maximizing the survival rate, maximizing total spatial
   coverage and maximizing backup coverage. Additionally, improved
   artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is used to solve the optimization
   problem. We design experiments with simulated and real-world scenarios
   for AED placements and evaluate the ASSA results. The experiments show
   that the ASSA can provide helpful guidance in optimizing AED placement
   in indoor space.}},

Abstract = {{Cabin hatch cover plays an important role for a typical aircraft to
   ensure the aircraft quality and flight safety. In the test flight
   inspection and routine maintenance of an aircraft, one crucial step is
   to open cabin hatch covers one by one for detailed inspection.
   Authorized operators suffer from difficulties to recognize different
   covers with similar shapes and different inspection requirements. In
   this paper, an edge-based cover recognition and tracking method is
   proposed to recognize different hatch covers with similar shapes. First,
   a fast edge feature is proposed to describe image contours with simple
   geometric constraints. Second, based on the edge feature, a novel cover
   descriptor, consisting of shape and position description vectors, is
   presented to recognize those different covers with similar shapes.
   Third, on the basis of recognized cover landmarks, a direct visual
   odometry-based camera tracking method is presented to improve the
   robustness of cover recognition. The experiments are implemented in a
   piece of simplified mockup of aircraft cabin skin, and the results show
   that the proposed method has good practicability and real-time property.
   Meanwhile, the tracking accuracy is also good enough in the augmented
   reality inspection environment.}},

Abstract = {{Plant immune signalling activated by the perception of
   pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or effector proteins is
   mediated by pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) and nucleotide-binding
   and leucine-rich repeat domain-containing receptors (NLRs), which often
   share cellular components and downstream responses. Many PRRs are
   leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs), which mostly
   perceive proteinaceous PAMPs. The suppressor of the G2 allele of skp1
   (SGT1) is a core immune regulator required for the activation of
   NLR-mediated immunity. In this work, we examined the requirement of SGT1
   for immune responses mediated by several LRR-RLKs in both Nicotiana
   benthamiana and Arabidopsis. Using complementary genetic approaches, we
   found that SGT1 is not limiting for early PRR-dependent responses or
   antibacterial immunity. We therefore conclude that SGT1 does not play a
   significant role in bacterial PAMP-triggered immunity.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to compare recreationally physically active
   females and males with regard to spine, pelvis and lower limb joints
   peak angles in each plane of motion during a single leg squat (SLS). The
   second aim is to investigate the relationship between kinematics and SLS
   depth in females and males. Fifty-eight healthy, young adults performed
   5 repetitions of a single right leg squat to maximal depth while keeping
   their balance. Kinematic data were obtained using an optical motion
   capture system. At the hip, greater adduction and greater internal
   rotation were observed in females than in males. Females had more
   extended spines and less outward bended knees throughout the SLS than
   did men. In males, squat depth was significantly, positively correlated
   with the maximal angle of the ankle (r=0.60, p<0.001), the knee (r=0.87,
   p<0.001), the hip (r=0.73, p<0.001) and the pelvis (r=0.40, p=0.02) in
   the sagittal plane. A positive significant correlation was found between
   SLS depth and maximal angle of the knee (r=0.88, p<0.001) and the ankle
   (r=0.53, p=0.01) in the sagittal plane in females. Males and females
   used different motor strategies at all levels of the kinematic chain
   during SLS.}},

Title = {{Suppression of NLRP3 Inflammasome, Pyroptosis, and Cell Death by NIM811
   in Rotenone-Exposed Cells as an in vitro Model of Parkinson's Disease}},
Journal = {{NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES}},
Year = {{2021}},

Abstract = {{Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the selective
   death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Recently, NLRP3
   inflammasome and pyroptosis were found to be associated with PD.
   Cyclosporine A (CsA), an immunosuppressant, reduces neuronal death in
   PD. However, CsA could hardly pass through the blood-brain barrier (BBB)
   and high dose is associated with severe side effects and toxicity.
   N-methyl-4-isoleucine-cyclosporine (NIM811) is a CsA derivate that can
   pass through the BBB. However, little is known about its effect on PD.
   Objective: The objectives of this study were to explore the mechanism of
   rotenone-induced cell damage and to examine the protective effects of
   NIM811 on the neurotoxicity of a Parkinson-like in vitro model induced
   by rotenone. Methods: Murine hippocampal HT22 cells were cultured with
   the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone, a widely used pesticide
   that has been used for many years as a tool to induce a PD model in
   vitro and in vivo and proven to be reproducible. NIM811 was added to the
   culture media 3 h prior to the rotenone incubation. Cell viability was
   determined by resazurin assay, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production
   by dihydroethidine (DHE), and mitochondrial membrane potential by
   tetramethyl rhodamine methyl ester (TMRM). TUNEL and caspase-1
   immunofluorescent double staining was used to detect pyroptosis. NLRP3,
   caspase-1, pro-caspase-1, GSDMD, and interleukin-18 (IL-18) were
   measured using Western blotting after 24 h of rotenone incubation. The
   reactivity of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) was determined by ELISA.
   Results: Our results demonstrated that rotenone caused more than 40\% of
   cell death, increased ROS production, and reduced mitochondrial membrane
   potential, while NIM811 reversed these alterations. Immunofluorescent
   double staining showed that rotenone increased the percentage of
   caspase-1 and TUNEL double-labelled cells, an indication of pyroptosis,
   after 24 h of incubation. The protein expression of NLRP3, caspase-1,
   pro-caspase-1, GSDMD, IL-18, and IL-1 beta was significantly increased
   after 24 h of rotenone incubation. NIM811 suppressed rotenone-induced
   pyroptosis and downregulated the protein expression of NLRP3, caspase-1,
   pro-caspase-1, GSDMD, IL-1 beta, and IL-18. Conclusion: These results
   provide evidence that rotenone activates the NLRP3 inflammomere and
   induces pyroptosis. NIM811 protects the cell from rotenone-induced
   damage and inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome and pyroptosis. NIM811 might
   serve as a potential therapeutic drug in the treatment of PD.}},

   Role Ambiguity on Innovation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND PSYCHOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{This research seeks to integrate traditional formal leadership
   structures and emerging shared leadership approaches to team leadership
   to examine how they jointly relate to innovative outcomes in teams. To
   reconcile contradictory theory and research that views formal leadership
   as both beneficial and detrimental to informal leadership, we take a
   contingency-based approach and hypothesize and find that a designated,
   nominal formal leader is positively related to shared leadership
   emergence when role ambiguity is high. Additionally, high role ambiguity
   enhances the indirect effect of designated formal leadership on team
   innovation via shared leadership. Alternatively, low ambiguity
   neutralizes the effect of designated formal leadership on shared
   leadership and the indirect effect on team innovation via shared
   leadership. These findings help to address conflicting perspectives
   regarding the linkage of formal leadership and shared leadership and
   their respective influence on team innovation.}},

   a structure-based mass transfer model taking account of the gas-solid

Title = {{Trends in disease-free life expectancy at age 65 in Spain: Diverging
   patterns by sex, region and disease}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 11}},
Abstract = {{Life expectancy in Spain is among the highest in the world.
   Nevertheless, we do not know if improvements in health conditions at
   older ages have followed postponements of death. Previous studies in
   Spain show a stable trend in years lived in ill health in the past. In
   this paper we investigate changes between 2006, 2012 and 2017 in life
   expectancy with and without disease at age 65 in Spain and, for the
   first time, in Spanish regions, which have autonomous powers of health
   planning, public health and healthcare. Results show that, at the
   country level, disease-free life expectancy reduced between 2006 and
   2017 in Spain. This was explained by an expansion of most diseases
   except for some cardiovascular and respiratory chronic conditions.
   However, at the regional level the evolution was different, especially
   regarding each disease and sex. First, regional differences reduced
   between 2006 and 2012 but largely widened in 2017, suggesting that not
   all regions had the same ability to recover after the 2008 financial
   crisis that caused government cuts to health services. Second, regional
   analysis also highlighted diverging trends by sex. While men experienced
   expansion of morbidity in most regions, women experienced a compression
   in about half of them, ending up with women showing higher disease-free
   life expectancies than men in 9 out of the 17 regions considered. This
   study, then, calls attention to the importance of focusing the analysis
   of health surveillance to more disaggregated levels, more in accordance
   with the level of health management, as regional trends showed
   heterogeneity in the prevalence of diseases and different progresses in
   the relationship between sexes.}},

Title = {{Does procedural justice climate increase the identification and
   engagement of migrant workers? A group engagement model perspective}},
Journal = {{PERSONNEL REVIEW}},
Abstract = {{Purpose Migrant workers often suffer from social exclusion in the
   workplace and therefore identify less with their organization and engage
   less with their work. To address this issue, the authors integrate
   research on migrant workers with research on the group engagement model
   to create a model for understanding and enhancing migrant worker
   engagement. This allows us to provide insight into how organizations can
   design their human resource management systems and practices to increase
   the work engagement of migrant workers. Design/methodology/approach The
   authors conducted a survey study with over 4,000 employees from more
   than 500 workplaces in Australia to test the model. Findings The results
   of the multilevel analysis indicate that a procedurally fair work
   environment increases organizational identification, which in turn is
   associated with higher work engagement. The results also indicate that
   procedural justice climate is more important for migrant workers and
   increases their organizational identification and engagement.
   Originality/value To increase work engagement of migrant workers,
   organizations can establish a procedurally fair work environment in
   which cultural minorities experience unbiased policies and procedures,
   are able to express their opinions and participate in decision-making.}},

Title = {{Water marginality in rural and peri-urban communities}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{273}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Water supply in an increasing number of rural and peri-urban communities
   can be described as marginal i.e. subject to failure, becoming
   unaffordable or increasingly difficult to access. A range of common
   factors contribute to water marginalisation or access bias. Firstly,
   communities may be poorly served by formal water infrastructure by being
   on the margins of urban settlements. Secondly, where water
   infrastructure exists, this may be prone to failure as local
   municipalities and water utilities with limited capacity and resources
   struggle to maintain a widely dispersed system. Thirdly, when local
   water systems fail, they are often not repaired quickly, if repaired at
   all. This results in people, often with very limited resources having to
   obtain water from far distances or having to pay someone to transport
   water to them in order to meet their basic water needs. Thus, where
   water supplies are unreliable, unaffordable and difficult to access,
   geography, urban settlement patterns, the choice of water distribution
   systems, and the management capacity result in water marginality.
   This paper investigates water marginality in communities in rural and
   peri-urban areas in South Africa. It utilises surveys and interviews of
   communities, the local authority, water and urban planning officials, to
   understand the nature of this marginality, and investigates the key
   contributory factors. This forms the basis for recommendations on how
   access and marginalisation challenges can be addressed. The paper
   provides valuable insights on how, and why, water marginality occurs,
   and proposes strategies for sustainable solutions. As climate change and
   rural-urban migration accentuate water marginality, the study offers
   important and timely insights in an area that urgently requires further
   research. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This research demonstrates a high-performance temperature sensor based
   on the one-dimensional photonic crystal. The main idea of our sensing
   procedure is essentially depending on the pyroelectric effect, Tamm
   plasmon resonance, and Fano resonance. The designed sensor is configured
   as prism/Au/{[}LiNbO3/air](N)/SiO2. The inclusion of a thin layer of Au
   leads to the appearance of Tamm and Fano resonances. The novel thermal
   characteristics of LiNbO3 could have a significant effect on the
   position of these resonant modes. Thus, the shift in the position of the
   resonant mode due to temperature variations plays a fundamental role in
   the sensing process. The numerical results were performed based on the
   optimization procedure of the different parameters to investigate the
   highest possible performance. Therefore, the optimized sensor provides a
   higher sensitivity (3.035 nm/K) than many previously reported data.}},

Title = {{Revealing oral microbiota composition and functionality associated with
   heavy cigarette smoking}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundHeavy tobacco smoking, a hallmark feature of lung cancer, is
   drastically predominant in Middle Eastern populations. The precise links
   between nicotine dependence and the functional contribution of the oral
   microbiota remain unknown in these populations.MethodsWe evaluated the
   composition and functional capabilities of oral microbiota with relation
   to cigarette smoking in 105 adults through shotgun metagenomics using
   buccal swabs.ResultsThe oral microbiota composition in our study
   subjects was dominated by the phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria,
   Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes, in addition to the genera Prevotella
   and Veillonella, similar to previously described westernized cohorts.
   Furthermore, the smoker's oral microbiota represented a significant
   abundance of Veillonella dispar, Leptotrichia spp. and Prevotella
   pleuritidis when compared to non-smokers. Within the smoking groups,
   differential relative abundance testing unveiled relative abundance of
   Streptobacillus hongkongensis, Fusobacterium massiliense, Prevotella
   bivia in high nicotine dependent compared to low nicotine dependent
   profiles based on Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence. Functional
   profiling showed marked differences between smokers and non-smokers.
   Smokers exhibited an enrichment of Tricarballylate utilization and
   Lactate racemization when compared to the non-smokers. According to
   their nicotine dependence, enrichment of Xanthosine utilization,
   p-Aminobenzoyl-Glutamate utilization, and multidrug efflux pump in
   Campylobacter jejuni biosynthesis modules were detected in the high
   nicotine dependent group.ConclusionsThese compositional and functional
   differences may provide critical insight on how variations in the oral
   microbiota could predispose to respiratory illnesses and smoke cessation
   relapse in cigarette smokers. In particular, the observed enrichment of
   Fusobacterium and Prevotella in the oral microbiota possibly suggests an
   intriguing linkage to gut and lung cancers.}},

Abstract = {{Background The chemical composition of Handal (Citrullus colocynthis L.)
   seed oil cultivated in Jordan deserts was characterized, and its
   bioactivity was evaluated.
   Methods The oil was extracted from the grinded seeds in 500 ml Soxhlet
   extractor for 24 hr using n-hexane, and the recovered fatty acids were
   methylated with methanolic-HCL. The fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs)
   composition was analyzed using GC-MS and GC-FID. The anticancer activity
   associated with the oil was assessed against colon cancer cell lines
   (Caco-2 and HCT-116) and compared to its cytotoxicity on the human skin
   fibroblast. Multivariate analysis was used to determine relationship of
   the fatty acid composition with that of the anticancer activity.
   Results The results demonstrated that fatty acid composition of
   Citrullus colocynthis seed oil chiefly contains Linoleic acid, denoted
   as C18:2n6 (75\%), followed by Palmitic acid C16:0 (8\%), Stearic acid
   C18:0 (5\%), and Oleic acid C18:1n9 (9\%). It is demonstrated as an
   excellent source of essential fatty acids omega-6 (e.g., Linoleic acid),
   whereas omega-3 (e.g., alpha-Linolenic acid) and hydroxy polyunsaturated
   fatty acids are found at small level. Interestingly, the oil exhibited
   reasonable anticancer effects against colorectal cancer cell lines with
   IC50 values varying between 4 and 7 mg/ml. The correlation test revealed
   a relationship between the fatty acid composition and the effectiveness
   on treatments.
   Conclusions Handal plant from Jordan appears to have very high level of
   Linoleic acid compared to other oils measured in different geographic
   locations and that there appears to be some anticancer activities
   associated with the fatty acid content of Handal seed oil.}},

Title = {{Comparing zirconia to anterior strip crowns in primary anterior teeth in
   children: a randomized clinical trial}},

Abstract = {{Background Providing restorations to anterior teeth in children is a
   challenging task due to the need for high esthetics, strength, and
   durability. This study was done to compare prefabricated primary
   zirconia with resin composite strip crowns on primary maxillary central
   and lateral incisors with regards to gingival health, plaque
   accumulation, recurrent caries, restoration failure, and opposing teeth
   wear over a period of 3, 6 and 12 months. Methods Children attending the
   King Abdulaziz University, Faculty of Dentistry (KAUFD) clinics who
   needed restorations were screened for inclusion criteria. A total of 120
   teeth were treated; 60 with zirconia and 60 with strip crowns.
   Randomization was done by simple random allocation using SPSS software
   version 20.0 (Armonk, NY; IBM Corp.). A simple descriptive statistic was
   used for analysis by Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test and Chi-square test.
   Level of significance was set at (alpha = 0.05) and level of confidence
   at (95\%). The presented research was registered retrospectively at
   ClinicalTrials.gov in 6th of August 2017, under registration number
   NCT03184012. Results Zirconia crowns showed significantly less gingival
   bleeding at the 3- and 6-months follow up periods (p < 0.006, p < 0.001;
   respectively), less plaque accumulation at all follow up visits (p <
   0.001), no restoration failure (p < 0.001), but more wear to opposing
   teeth (p < 0.02). No significant difference was found between the two
   crowns with regards to recurrent caries (p < 0.135). Conclusion Based on
   our data we conclude that overtime teeth covered with zirconia crowns
   show better gingival health and less bleeding, plaque accumulation as
   well as less loss of material. On the other hand, zirconia can cause
   more loss of opposing tooth structure.}},

Title = {{The Mid-Fusiform Sulcus in Autism Spectrum Disorder: Establishing a
   Novel Anatomical Landmark Related to Face Processing}},
Journal = {{AUTISM RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{53-64}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Despite decades of research, the brain basis of aberrant face processing
   in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remains a topic of debate. The
   mid-fusiform sulcus (MFS), a minor feature of the ventral
   occipitotemporal cortex, provides new directions for studying face
   processing. The MFS closely aligns with face-selective cortical patches
   and other structural and functional divisions of the fusiform gyrus;
   however, it has received little attention in clinical populations. We
   collected structural MRI data from 54 individuals with ASD and 61
   age-and-IQ-matched controls ages 8 to 40 years. The MFS was identified
   on cortical surface reconstructions via 4 trained raters and classified
   into known surface patterns. Mean MFS gray matter volume (GMV), cortical
   surface area (SA), cortical thickness (CT), and standard deviation of CT
   (CT SD) were extracted. Effects of diagnosis, age, and hemisphere on MFS
   surface presentation and morphometry were assessed via multinomial
   logistic regression and mixed effects general linear modeling,
   respectively. The MFS was reliably identified in 97\% of hemispheres
   examined. Macroanatomical patterns and age-related decreases in MFS GMV
   and CT were similar between groups. CT SD was greater in the left
   hemisphere in ASD. Participants' ability to interpret emotions and
   mental states from facial features was significantly negatively
   correlated with MFS CT and CT SD. Overall, the MFS is a stable feature
   of the fusiform gyrus in ASD and CT related measures appear to be
   sensitive to diagnosis and behavior. These results can inform future
   investigations of face processing and structure-function relationships
   in populations with social deficits.
   Lay Summary A small structural feature of the brain related to seeing
   faces (the mid-fusiform sulcus; MFS) appears similar in autism spectrum
   disorder (ASD) and neurotypical development; however, the thickness of
   this structure on the left side of the brain is more variable in ASD.
   People who are better at judging mental states from another person's
   eyes tend to have thinner and less variable MFS. This feature may teach
   us more about face processing and how brain structure influences
   function in ASD.}},

Abstract = {{The advent of unconventional oil and gas has resulted in a plethora of
   shale gas production, and it has been predicted to increase from 1 in
   2000 to 40\% in 2035 of the total US domestic gas produced. Since shale
   gas is both industrially economical and environmentally clean compared
   to oil or coal as a resource, many studies are focused on developing
   technologies to monetize shale gas. However, one of the key challenges
   in utilizing shale gas is its varied flow rate and uncertain
   compositional behavior. The flow rate of a shale gas well dwindles over
   a period of time, and the composition differs from well to well in the
   same shale play. This provides a challenge in designing a plant of
   optimum capacity for shale gas processing and natural gas liquids (NGL)
   recovery. In this study, the periodic variation in feed flow rate is
   addressed while designing shale gas processing and NGL recovery plant.
   Different shale gas flow rates as obtained from average shale gas rate
   declination curve of a shale play over the period of well life is used
   for the design of five different plants with varied capacities. The
   corresponding economics of different plants are compared to find optimal
   plant capacity. The base case scenario is further improved through
   incorporation of heat integration and optimization of individual units
   of the process using pinch and sensitivity analyses, respectively.
   Economic analysis of the optimum plant size is also performed with a
   constant feed flow rate over its entire life. From the economic analysis
   of various period studies, it is observed that the optimum plant design
   with highest ROI percentage has more than minimum ROI requirement both
   with declining and constant flow rate case, implying that the proposed
   processing plant is economically viable to implement. Finally,
   environmental impact of the base case and improved design is also
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Due to recent developments in steady-state and ultrafast spectroscopic
   techniques there are more readily available methods to excite and
   observe anisotropic low-dimensional materials in transient states using
   light-matter interactions. Here, the authors observe photoinduced
   metal-insulator transitions in a quasi-one-dimensional metal, and
   analyse the role of d-d excitonic excitations in the transient state.
   Photoinduced phase transitions in matters have gained tremendous
   attention over the past few years. However, their ultrashort lifetime
   makes their study and possible control very challenging. Here, we report
   on highly anisotropic d-d excitonic excitations yielding photoinduced
   metal-insulator transitions (MITs) in quasi-one-dimensional metals
   Sr1-yNbOx using Mueller-Matrix spectroscopic ellipsometry, transient
   ultraviolet Raman spectroscopy, transient mid-infrared reflectivity and
   angular-resolved photoemission spectroscopy supported with density
   functional theory. Interestingly, the MITs are driven by photo-pumping
   of d-d excitons, causing the metallic a-axis to become insulating while
   the insulating b- and c-axis concomitantly become a correlated metal. We
   assign these effects to an interplay between the melting of charge and
   lattice orderings along the different anisotropic optical axes and
   Bose-Einstein-like condensation of the photoinduced excitons. The long
   lifetime in the order of several seconds of the metastable MITs gives
   greater flexibility to study and manipulate the transient excitonic
   state for potential applications in exciton-based optoelectronic
   devices.}},

Abstract = {{Access to complex in vitro models that recapitulate the unique markers
   and cell-cell interactions of the hair follicle is rather limited.
   Creation of scalable, affordable, and relevant in vitro systems which
   can provide predictive screens of cosmetic ingredients and therapeutic
   actives for hair health would be highly valued. In this study, we
   explore the features of the microfollicle, a human hair follicle
   organoid model based on the spatio-temporally defined co-culture of
   primary cells. The microfollicle provides a 3D differentiation platform
   for outer root sheath keratinocytes, dermal papilla fibroblasts, and
   melanocytes, via epidermal-mesenchymal-neuroectodermal cross-talk. For
   assay applications, microfollicle cultures were adapted to 96-well
   plates suitable for medium-throughput testing up to 21 days, and
   characterized for their spatial and lineage markers. The microfollicles
   showed hair-specific keratin expression in both early and late stages of
   cultivation. The gene expression profile of microfollicles was also
   compared with human clinical biopsy samples in response to the benchmark
   hair-growth compound, minoxidil. The gene expression changes in
   microfollicles showed up to 75\% overlap with the corresponding gene
   expression signature observed in the clinical study. Based on our
   results, the cultivation of the microfollicle appears to be a practical
   tool for generating testable insights for hair follicle development and
   offers a complex model for pre-clinical substance testing.}},

Abstract = {{An interdisciplinary course called ``The Chemistry of Poisons{''} was
   created, featuring organic chemistry, biology, pharmacology, and
   toxicology content. This exploratory chemistry elective course was
   created by an instructor with a background in synthetic organic
   chemistry and a teaching assistant with a background in pharmacy
   practice. ``The Chemistry of Poisons{''} features an interdisciplinary,
   student-centered approach to learning that provides a foundation for
   future academic initiatives to deliver chemical, pharmacological, and
   humanistic content in a manner that is both enjoyable for students and
   demonstrably facilitates knowledge and application level learning.
   Student course feedback and a retrospective survey were used to gauge
   student-perceived learning achievement. Survey results and feedback were
   consistent with knowledge and application level learning of course
   content and preference for interdisciplinary course design. These
   results warrant further development and study of interdisciplinary
   strategies for chemical education.}},

Title = {{XENON1T excess in local Z(2) DM models with light dark sector}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS LETTERS B}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{810}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Recently XENON1T Collaboration announced that they observed some excess
   in the electron recoil energy around a 2-3 keV. We show that this excess
   can be interpreted as exothermic scattering of excited dark matter on
   atomic electron through dark photon exchange. We consider DM models with
   local dark U(1) gauge symmetry that is spontaneously broken into its
   Z(2) subgroup by Krauss-Wilczek mechanism. In order to explain the
   XENON1T excess with the correct DM thermal relic density within
   freeze-out scenario, all the particles in the dark sector should be
   light enough, namely similar to O (100) MeV for scalar DM and similar to
   O (1 - 10) MeV for fermion DM cases. And even lighter dark Higgs phi
   plays an important role in the DM relic density calculation: XX dagger
   -> Z'phi for scalar DM (X) and chi(chi) over bar -> phi phi for fermion
   DM (chi) assuming m(Z)' -> m(chi). Both of them are in the p-wave
   annihilation, and one can easily evade stringent bounds from Planck data
   on CMB on the s-wave annihilations, assuming other dangerous s-wave
   annihilations are kinematically forbidden. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{260}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Bagged trees ensemble, a machine-learning algorithm, was used for the
   first time to predict the dynamic modulus vertical bar E{*}vertical bar
   of dense-graded HMA mixtures with success. This algorithm contained a
   similar set of input variables as the NCHRP 1-40D and Hirsch models of
   vertical bar E{*}vertical bar and was implemented in the statistics
   toolbox of Matlab R2018b. It was trained and tested on 1656 vertical bar
   E{*}vertical bar values from 93 typical South Carolina HMA mixtures. Of
   the tested mixtures, 61\% contained RAP. For comparison purposes, the
   performance of bagged trees was compared with two already published ANNs
   in the literature. The results showed that: 1) Coupling VMA and G(b){*}
   input variables had the most significant influence on vertical bar
   E{*}vertical bar. 2) Bagged trees exhibited a significantly better
   prediction accuracy than the Bari-Witczak and Hirsch regression models
   with an R-2 greater than 0.94 on testing. 3) Bagged trees performed
   better than two already published ANN models of In In conclusion, bagged
   trees is a useful tool for estimating vertical bar E{*}vertical bar of
   HMA mixtures. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) induces long-lasting T-cell immune
   responses that control but do not dear infection. Typical responses
   involve private T-cell clones, expressing T-cell antigen receptors
   (TCRs) unique to a person, and public T-cell clones with identical TCRs
   active in different people. Here, we report the development of a
   pretherapeutic immunostimulation modality against HCMV for human T
   cells, CD3 copotentiation, and the clonal analysis of its effects in
   recall assays at single-cell resolution. CD3 copotentiation of human T
   cells required identification of an intrinsically inert anti-CD3 Fab
   fragment that conditionally augmented signaling only when TCR was
   coengaged with antigen. When applied in recall assays, CD3
   copotentiation enhanced the expansion of both public and private T-cell
   clones responding to autologous HLA-A2(+) antigen-presenting cells and
   immunodominant NLVPMVATV (NLV) peptide from HCMV pp65 protein.
   Interestingly, public vs private TCR expression was associated with
   distinct clonal expansion signatures in response to recall stimulus.
   This implied that besides possible differences in their generation and
   selection in an immune response, public and private T cells may respond
   differently to pharmacoimmunomodulation. Furthermore, a third clonal
   expansion profile was observed upon CD3 copotentiation of T-cell clones
   from HLA-A2(-) donors and 1 HLA-A2(+) presumed-uninfected donor, where
   NLV was of low intrinsic potency. We conclude that human T-cell
   copotentiation can increase the expansion of different classes of T-cell
   clones C) responding to recall antigens of different strengths, and this
   may be exploitable for therapeutic development against chronic,
   persistent infections such as HCMV.}},

Title = {{Inability to accumulate Ni in a genus of hyperaccumulators: the paradox
   of Odontarrhena sibirica (Brassicaceae)}},
Journal = {{PLANTA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{252}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Main conclusion Odontarrhena is a highly diverse genus of
   Ni-hyperaccumulators. Here, we demonstrate substantial inability to
   accumulate Ni in the facultative serpentinophyte O. sibirica, which
   seems a unique case among the numerous species of the genus that grow on
   ultramafic soils.
   Odontarrhena is the most diverse genus of Ni-accumulating plants in W
   Eurasia, with most taxa growing obligatorily or facultatively on
   ultramafic soils. A notable exception may be O. sibirica, a facultative
   serpentinophyte from the E Mediterranean and W Asia in which
   accumulation ability is still enigmatic. We addressed this issue using
   observational and experimental methods. Atomic Absorption Analysis of 33
   herbarium specimens and plant and soil samples from seven ultramafic and
   non-ultramafic sites in Greece revealed shoot Ni values always much
   lower than 1000 mu g g(-1), non-significant differences between plants
   from the two soil types and no relationship with soil pH. Only two
   Turkish specimens from waste mines had shoot Ni concentration > 1000 mu
   g g(-1). The reasons for this deviating result remain obscure, but may
   be associated with inherent peculiarities of the local populations. When
   cultivated together with congeneric Ni-accumulating species on the same
   natural ultramafic soil, only O. sibirica was unable to accumulate the
   metal. Although plant growth was stimulated in hydroponics at relatively
   low NiSO4 levels (50-150 mu M), as typical for hyperaccumulators,
   Ni-accumulation occurred only at higher concentrations which had a toxic
   effect. This peculiar combination of Ni-response traits could be the
   result of a partial evolutionary loss of ability with respect to all
   other Ni-accumulating congeneric species. For this, O. sibirica could
   represent a unique model system for further studies on the evolutionary
   dynamics, physiological mechanisms and genetic control of metal
   accumulation and homeostasis.}},

Title = {{Digital Otoscopy Videos Versus Composite Images: A Reader Study to

Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{E1668-E1676}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Objectives/Hypothesis With the increasing emphasis on developing
   effective telemedicine approaches in Otolaryngology, this study explored
   whether a single composite image stitched from a digital otoscopy video
   provides acceptable diagnostic information to make an accurate
   diagnosis, as compared with that provided by the full video.
   Study Design Diagnostic survey analysis.
   Methods Five Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) physicians reviewed the same
   set of 78 digital otoscope eardrum videos from four eardrum conditions:
   normal, effusion, retraction, and tympanosclerosis, along with the
   composite images generated by a SelectStitch method that selectively
   uses video frames with computer-assisted selection, as well as a Stitch
   method that incorporates all the video frames. Participants provided a
   diagnosis for each item along with a rating of diagnostic confidence.
   Diagnostic accuracy for each pathology of SelectStitch was compared with
   accuracy when reviewing the entire video clip and when reviewing the
   Stitch image.
   Results There were no significant differences in diagnostic accuracy for
   physicians reviewing SelectStitch images and full video clips, but both
   provided better diagnostic accuracy than Stitch images. The inter-reader
   agreement was moderate.
   Conclusions Equal to using full video clips, composite images of
   eardrums generated by SelectStitch provided sufficient information for
   ENTs to make the correct diagnoses for most pathologies. These findings
   suggest that use of a composite eardrum image may be sufficient for
   telemedicine approaches to ear diagnosis, eliminating the need for
   storage and transmission of large video files, along with future
   applications for improved documentation in electronic medical record
   systems, patient/family counseling, and clinical training.

Abstract = {{Several studies now show that certain proteins exhibit selective
   preference toward liquid ordered (L-o) or toward liquid disordered (L-d)
   regions of the heterogeneous membrane and some of them have preference
   for the L-o-L-d interface. Spatially heterogenous organization of
   lipids, enriched in specific protein molecules, function as platforms
   for signaling and are involved in several other physiologically critical
   functions. In this review, we collate together some of the experimental
   observations of cases where proteins preferentially segregate into
   different phases and highlight the importance of these preferential
   localization in terms of underlying functions. We also try to understand
   the structural features and chemical makeup of the membrane-interacting
   motifs of these proteins. Finally, we put forth some preliminary
   analysis on class I viral fusion proteins, some of which are known to
   partition at the L-o-L-d interface, and through them we try to
   understand the evolutionary design principles of phase segregating
   proteins. Put together, this review summarizes the existing studies on
   preferential partitioning of proteins into different membrane phases
   while emphasizing the need to understand the molecular design-level
   features that can help us ``engineer{''} functionally rich peptides and
   proteins with a programmed membrane partitioning.}},

Title = {{Partial-wave representation of the strong-field approximation}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{The strong-field approximation (SFA) has been widely applied to model
   ionization processes in short and intense laser pulses. Several
   approaches have been suggested in order to overcome certain limitations
   of the original SFA formulation with regard to the representation of the
   initial bound and final continuum states of the emitted electron as well
   as a suitable description of the driving laser pulse. We here present a
   reformulation of the SFA in terms of partial waves and spherical tensor
   operators that supports a quite simple implementation and the comparison
   of different treatments of the active (photo)electron and the laser
   pulses. In particular, this reformulation helps to adapt the SFA to
   experimental setups, and it paves the way to extend the strong-field
   theory toward the study of nondipole contributions in light-atom
   interactions as well as of many-particle correlations in strong-field
   ionization processes. A series of detailed computations have been
   carried out in order to confirm the validity of the reformulation and to
   show how the representation of the bound and continuum states affects
   the predicted above-threshold ionization spectra and related
   observables.}},

Abstract = {{We assess how the 2010 Merger Guidelines have been applied by agencies

   sometimes overemphasize market definition.
   Market concentration thresholds remain a reflection of agency practice
   rather than economic research. The Upward Price Pressure concept yields
   useful intuition, but UPP can be overused. The benefits that could arise
   from the renewed focus on coordinated effects are squandered by the lack
   of a rigorous economic framework recognizing the connection to
   unilateral effects. The lack of merger retrospectives remains a problem.}},

Abstract = {{Potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) are promising alternatives to lithium-ion
   batteries because of the advantage of abundant, low-cost potassium
   resources. However, PIBs are facing a pivotal challenge to develop
   suitable electrode materials for efficient insertion/extraction of
   large-radius potassium ions (K+). Here, a viable anode material composed
   of uniform, hollow porous bowl-like hard carbon dual doped with nitrogen
   (N) and phosphorus (P) (denoted as N/P-HPCB) is developed for
   high-performance PIBs. With prominent merits in structure, the
   as-fabricated N/P-HPCB electrode manifests extraordinary potassium
   storage performance in terms of high reversible capacity (458.3 mAh
   g(-1) after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g(-1)), superior rate performance (213.6
   mAh g(-1) at 4 A g(-1)), and long-term cyclability (205.2 mAh g(-1)
   after 1000 cycles at 2 A g(-1)). Density-functional theory calculations
   reveal the merits of N/P dual doping in favor of facilitating the
   adsorption/diffusion of K+ and enhancing the electronic conductivity,
   guaranteeing improved capacity, and rate capability. Moreover, in situ
   transmission electron microscopy in conjunction with ex situ microscopy
   and Raman spectroscopy confirms the exceptional cycling stability
   originating from the excellent phase reversibility and robust structure
   integrity of N/P-HPCB electrode during cycling. Overall, the findings
   shed light on the development of high-performance, durable carbon anodes
   for advanced PIBs.}},

Abstract = {{Epidemiological studies have demonstrated significant associations
   between traffic-related air pollution and adverse health outcomes.
   Personal exposure to fine particles (PM2.5) in transport
   microenvironments and their toxicological properties remain to be
   investigated. Commuter exposures were investigated in public transport
   systems (including the buses and Mass Transit Railway (MTR)) along two
   sampling routes in Hong Kong. Real-time sampling for PM2.5 and black
   carbon (BC), along with integrated PM2.5 sampling, were performed during
   the warm and cold season of 2016-2017, respectively. Commuter exposure
   to BC during 3-hour commuting time exhibited a wider range, from 3.4 to
   4.6 mu g/m(3) on the bus and 5.5 to 8.7 mu g/m(3) in MTR cabin (p <
   .05). PM2.5 mass andmajor chemical constituents (including organic
   carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), andmetals) were analyzed.
   Cytotoxicity, including cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS)
   production, was determined in addition to acellular ROS generation.
   PM2.5 treatment promoted the ROS generation in a concentration-dependent
   manner. Consistent diurnal variationswere observed for commuter exposure
   to BC and PM2.5 components, along with cellular and acellular ROS
   generation, which marked with two peaks during the morning (08:00-11:00)
   and evening rush hours (17:30-20:30). Commuter exposures in the MTR
   system were characterized by higher levels of PM2.5 and elemental
   components (e.g., Ca, Cr, Fe, Zn, Ba) compared to riding the bus,
   alongwith higher cellular and acellular ROS production (p < .01). These
   metals were attributed to different sources: rail tracks, wheels,
   brakes, and crustal origin. Weak to moderate associations were shown for
   the analyzed transition metals with PM2.5-induced cell viability and
   cellular ROS. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that Ni, Zn,
   Mn, Fe, Ti, and Co attributed to cytotoxicity and ROS generation. These
   findings underscore the importance of commuter exposures and their toxic
   effects, urging effective mitigating strategies to protect human health.

Abstract = {{Dinuclear copper(II) complex {[}Cu-2(L)(2)(mu(2-1,1)-N-3)(2)(N-3)(2)]
   (1) with double mu(1,1)-azido bridges and polynuclear nickel(II) complex
   {[}Ni(L)(mu(2-1,1)-N-3)(mu(2-1,3)-N-3)](n) (2) with alternate double
   mu(1,1)-azido and mu(1,3)-azido bridges {[}L =
   1-amino-2-(dimethylamino)ethane, N3(-) = azide ion] have been
   synthesized and were characterized by physicochemical and spectroscopic
   methods. X-ray structural analysis revealed that each Cu(II) center of 1
   adopts a distorted square-pyramidal geometry with a CuN5 chromophore
   ligated through two N atoms of L, two N atoms of double bridging
   (mu(1,1)-N-3), and one N atom of terminal azide ion. On the other hand,
   each Ni(II) center around the asymmetric unit of 2 adopts a distorted
   octahedral geometry with a NiN6 chromophore ligated through two N atoms
   of L, two N atoms of double mu(1,1)-N-3, and two N atoms of double
   mu(1,3)-N-3 bridges. The adjacent nickel centers are connected to
   alternate double mu(1,1)-N-3 and double mu(1,3)-N-3 bridges, affording a
   one-dimensional (1D) polymeric chain structure. Temperature-dependent
   magnetic susceptibility measurements evidenced a dominant
   antiferromagnetic interaction between the metal centers of both
   complexes 1 and 2.}},

   Rank-size and size-distribution representations}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, researchers have realized the difficulties of fitting
   power-law distributions properly. These difficulties are higher in
   Zipfian systems, due to the discreteness of the variables and to the
   existence of two representations for these systems, i.e., two versions
   depending on the random variable to fit: rank or size. The discreteness
   implies that a power law in one of the representations is not a power
   law in the other, and vice versa. We generate synthetic power laws in
   both representations and apply a state-of-the-art fitting method to each
   of the two random variables. The method (based on maximum likelihood
   plus a goodness-of-fit test) does not fit the whole distribution but the
   tail, understood as the part of a distribution above a cutoff that
   separates non-power-law behavior from power-law behavior. We find that,
   no matter which random variable is power-law distributed, using the rank
   as the random variable is problematic for fitting, in general (although
   it may work in some limit cases). One of the difficulties comes from
   recovering the ``hidden{''} true ranks from the empirical ranks. On the
   contrary, the representation in terms of the distribution of sizes
   allows one to recover the true exponent (with some small bias when the
   underlying size distribution is a power law only asymptotically).}},

Title = {{Closing the Digital Health Evidence Gap: Development of a Predictive
   Score to Maximize Patient Outcomes}},
Journal = {{TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1029-1038}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: linical studies of telemedicine (TM) programs for chronic
   illness have demonstrated mixed results across settings and populations.
   With recent uptake in use of digital health modalities, more precise
   patient classification may improve outcomes, efficiency, and
   effectiveness.
   Objective: The purpose of the research was to develop a predictive score
   that measures the influence of patient characteristics on TM
   interventions. The central hypothesis is that disease type, illness
   severity, and the social determinants of health influence outcomes,
   including resource utilization, and can be precisely characterized.
   Methods: The retrospective study evaluated the feasibility of creating a
   patient ``Telemedicine ImPact{''} (TIP) score derived from a Virginia
   Medicare and Medicaid claims data set. Claims were randomly selected,
   stratified by disease type, and matched by illness severity into a TM
   intervention group (N = 7,782) and a nontelemedicine ``usual care{''}
   control cohort (N = 7,981). The individual records were then summarized
   into 15,762 cases with 80\% of the cases used to develop, train, and
   test four predictive models (hospital utilization, readmissions, total
   utilization, and mortality) using 10-fold cross-validation.
   Results: Bayesian supervised machine learning achieved reference model
   performance index area under the curve for receiver operating
   characteristic (AUC/ROC) >= 0.85. Posterior probabilities for each
   outcome model were generated on a ``hold-back{''} set of 3,082 cases.
   Robust parametric statistical methods enabled dimension reduction, model
   validation, and derivation of a reliable composite scaled score that
   quantified the overall health risk for each case. The TM intervention
   cohort demonstrated higher total utilization (representing the sum of
   inpatient, outpatient, and prescription use) and lower mean inpatient
   utilization than the usual standard of care. This finding suggests
   TM-based care may shift the composition of health resource utilization,
   reducing hospitalizations while increasing outpatient services, adjusted
   for patient differences.
   Conclusions: The creation of a patient score using machine learning to
   predict the effect of TM on outcomes is feasible. Adoption of the TIP
   score may reduce variability in results by more precisely accounting for
   the effects of patient characteristics on health outcomes and
   utilization. More consistent outcome prediction may lead to greater
   support for digital health.}},

Abstract = {{Cellulose valorisation has been successfully addressed for years.
   However, the use of hemicellulosic hydrolysates is limited due to the
   presence of C5-sugars and inhibitors formed during pretreatment.
   Bacillus coagulans is one of the few bacteria able to utilize both C6-
   and C5-sugars to produce L-lactic acid, but its susceptibility to the
   lignocellulosic inhibitors needs further investigation. For such a
   purpose, the tolerance of different B. coagulans strains to increasing
   concentrations of inhibitors is studied. The isolated A162 strain
   reached the highest L-lactic acid productivity in all cases (up to 2.4 g
   L-1 h(-1)), even in presence of 5 g L-1 of furans and phenols.
   Remarkably, most of furans and phenolic aldehydes were removed from
   defined media and hemicellulosic gardening hydrolysate after
   fermentation with A162. Considering the high productivities and the
   biodetoxifying effect attained, A162 could be pointed out as a great
   candidate for valorisation of mixed sugars from hemicellulosic
   hydrolysates with high inhibitors concentration, promoting the
   implementation of lignocellulosic biorefineries.}},

Title = {{Testing limits: ERP evidence for word form preactivation during speeded
   sentence reading}},
Journal = {{PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{While it is commonly agreed upon that language comprehenders preactivate
   information at multiple levels, there is less consensus regarding what
   and when information is predicted, under which circumstances, and via
   which mechanism(s). Regarding when, Ito, Corley, Pickering, Martin, \&
   Nieuwland (2016) concluded that during sentence processing, word
   form-unlike semantic-preactivation crucially relies on the time
   available to generate late-stage predictions via language production
   mechanisms, setting this limit between 500 and 700 ms/word. The current
   event-related brain potential (ERP) study tests this proposal at a
   substantially faster serial visual presentation (SVP) rate of four
   words/s, on par with normal reading. We utilize the experimental design
   and replicate the general ERP findings of the two words/s SVP study of
   DeLong, Chan, \& Kutas (2019), with results showing similar N400
   reductions to unpredictable sentence continuations whether semantically
   or orthographically related to contextually predictable words, as well
   as an increased late posterior positivity to orthographic neighbors.
   These findings indicate that processing of written word information can
   be rapidly facilitated through context-based expectancies, establishing
   that if there is a time constraint for word form preactivation, it must
   be far less than limits specified by the prediction-by-production
   comprehension model championed by Ito et al.}},

Abstract = {{Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has the potential to capture spatial
   genetic heterogeneity in myeloma (MM) patients. We assessed whether
   cfDNA levels vary according to risk status defined by the 70 gene
   expression profile (GEP70). cfDNA levels in 77 patients were
   significantly higher in the GEP70 high-risk (HR) group compared to the
   low-risk (LR) group and correlated weakly with clinical markers
   including lactate dehydrogenase, beta(2)-microglobulin, and ISS.
   Patients with high cfDNA levels were associated with a worse PFS (hazard
   ratio 6.4; 95\% CI of ratio 1.9-22) and OS (hazard ratio 4.4; 95\% CI of
   ratio 1.2-15.7). Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) was elevated in the HR
   group and ctDNA correlated strongly with GEP70 risk score (Spearman r =
   .69, P = .0027). cfDNA concentrations were significantly elevated
   between days 3-5 after chemotherapy before falling back to baseline
   levels. ctDNA in two patients showed a similar spike in levels between
   days 3 and 5 after chemotherapy with a concomitant increase in allele
   fraction of KRAS mutations. We assessed cfDNA levels in 25 patients with
   smoldering myeloma with serial samples and showed increased allele
   fraction of mutated KRAS at progression in cfDNA. Our study shows that
   cfDNA is a dynamic tool to capture genetic events in myeloma.}},

Abstract = {{As sea surface temperatures increase worldwide due to climate change,
   coral bleaching events are becoming more frequent and severe, resulting
   in reef degradation. Leveraging the inherent ability of reef-building
   corals to acclimatize to thermal stress via pre-exposure to protective
   temperature treatments may become an important tool in improving the
   resilience of coral reefs to rapid environmental change. We investigated
   whether historical bleaching phenotype, coral host genotype, and
   exposure to protective temperature treatments would affect the response
   of the Hawaiian coral Montipora capitata to natural thermal stress.
   Fragments were collected from colonies that demonstrated different
   bleaching responses during the 2014-2015 event in Kane'ohe Bay (O'ahu,
   Hawai'i) and exposed to four different artificial temperature
   pre-treatments (and a control at ambient temperature). After recovery,
   fragments experienced a natural thermal stress event either in
   laboratory conditions or their native reef environment. Response to
   thermal stress was quantified by measuring changes in the algal
   symbionts' photochemical efficiency, community composition, and relative
   density. Historical bleaching phenotype was reflected in stable
   differences in symbiont community composition, with historically
   bleached corals containing only Cladocopium symbionts and historically
   non-bleached corals having mixed symbiont communities dominated by
   Durusdinium. Mixed-community corals lost more Cladocopium than
   Cladocopium-only corals during the natural thermal stress event and
   preferentially recovered with Durusdinium. Laboratory pre-treatments
   exposed corals to more thermal stress than anticipated, causing
   photochemical damage that varied significantly by genotype. While none
   of the treatments had a protective effect, temperature variation during
   treatments had a significant detrimental effect on photochemical
   efficiency during the thermal stress event. These results show that
   acclimatization potential is affected by fine-scale differences in
   temperature regime, host genotype, and relatively stable differences in
   symbiont community composition that underpin historical bleaching
   phenotypes in M. capitata.}},

Abstract = {{The seismic design of conventional frame structures is meant to enhance
   plastic deformations at beam ends and prevent yielding in columns. To
   this end, columns are made stronger than beams. Yet yielding in columns
   cannot be avoided with the column-to-beam strength ratios (about 1.3)
   prescribed by seismic codes. Preventing plastic deformations in columns
   calls for ratios close to 4, which is not feasible for economic reasons.
   Furthermore, material properties and the rearrangement of geometric
   shapes inevitably make the distribution of damage among stories uneven.
   Damage in the i-th story can be characterized as the accumulated plastic
   strain energy (W-pi) normalized by the product of the story shear force
   (Q(yi)) and drift (delta(yi)) at yielding. Past studies showed that the
   distribution of the plastic strain energy dissipation demand, W-pi
   /EWpj, can be evaluated from the deviation of Q(yi) with respect to an
   ``optimum value{''} that would make the ratio W-pi/(Q(yi) delta(yi))
   -i.e. the damage-equal in all stories. This paper investigates how the
   soil type and ductility demand affect the optimum lateral strength
   distribution. New optimum lateral strength distributions are put forth
   and compared with others proposed in the literature.}},

Title = {{Distribution of breast lesions diagnosed by cytology examination in

   Eritrea: a retrospective study}},
Journal = {{BMC WOMENS HEALTH}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Background: Fine needle aspiration cytology is a simple, relatively
   accurate, non-invasive, and cost-effective method of diagnosing most
   breast pathologies. To date, there is no sufficient data depicting the
   distribution of breast lesions detected by fine needle aspiration
   cytology in our healthcare setting. The aim of this study was to
   elucidate the general distribution of breast lesions diagnosed by
   cytology test at Eritrean National Health Laboratory.
   Methods: This retrospective study was carried out on 905 symptomatic
   patients between the years 2013 and 2017 at Eritrean National Health
   Laboratory. Diagnosis was made by fine needle aspiration cytology in
   patients with palpable breast lump and in some patients direct smear was
   prepared from a nipple discharge. Statistical analysis was carried out
   using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 23.
   Results: A total of 905 patients were included in the study, of whom 871
   (96.24\%) were females. The age range of patients was from 13 to 93
   years with mean and standard deviation of 33 +/- 14.9 years. Breast
   lump, occurring in 892 (98.56\%), was the most frequent presenting
   symptom. Fibroadenoma and fibrocystic breast lesions were the most
   prevalent lesions accounting for approximately 40\% and 15\%,
   respectively. Malignant breast lesions were seen predominantly in
   females above the age of 40 years with the highest frequency observed in
   the age range between 51 and 60 years. Pearson Chi-squared test showed
   significant association between patients' age above 40 years and the
   risk of having a malignant breast lesion (p < 0.001). The highest number
   of benign and malignant breast lesions was documented in 2014 with
   little fluctuation elsewhere in the study period.
   Conclusion: Fine needle aspiration cytology is a procedure of choice for
   preoperative diagnosis in breast lesions mainly in a resource-limited
   settings. Our study identified the occurrence of malignant breast
   lesions in young women, which is of a paramount public health concern.
   Of note, significant proportion of patients were late to seek medical
   attention. Therefore, enhancement of community awareness regarding
   breast disease and implementation of screening programs are necessary to
   ameliorate the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease.}},

Title = {{Temperature and strain controls on ice deformation mechanisms: insights
   from the microstructures of samples deformed to progressively higher
   strains at-10,-20 and-30 degrees C}},

Abstract = {{In order to better understand ice deformation mechanisms, we document
   the microstructural evolution of ice with increasing strain. We include
   data from experiments at relatively low temperatures (-20 and -30
   degrees C), where the microstructural evolution with axial strain has
   never before been documented. Polycrystalline pure water ice was
   deformed under a constant displacement rate (strain rate similar to 1.0
   x 10(-5) s(-1)) to progressively higher strains (similar to 3 \%, 5 \%,
   8 \%, 12 \% and 20 \%) at temperatures of -10, -20 and -30 degrees C.
   Microstructural data were generated from cryogenic electron
   backscattered diffraction (cryo-EBSD) analyses. All deformed samples
   contain subgrain (low-angle misorientations) structures with
   misorientation axes that lie dominantly in the basal plane, suggesting
   the activity of dislocation creep (glide primarily on the basal plane),
   recovery and subgrain rotation. Grain boundaries are lobate in all
   experiments, suggesting the operation of strain-induced grain boundary
   migration (GBM). Deformed ice samples are characterized by interlocking
   big and small grains and are, on average, finer grained than undeformed
   samples. Misorientation analyses between nearby grains in 2-D EBSD maps
   are consistent with some 2-D grains being different limbs of the same
   irregular grain in the 3-D volume. The proportion of repeated (i.e.
   interconnected) grains is greater in the higher-temperature experiments
   suggesting that grains have more irregular shapes, probably because GBM
   is more widespread at higher temperatures. The number of grains per unit
   area (accounting for multiple occurrences of the same 3-D grain) is
   higher in deformed samples than undeformed samples, and it increases
   with strain, suggesting that nucleation is involved in
   recrystallization. ``Core-and-mantle{''} structures (rings of small
   grains surrounding big grains) occur in -20 and -30 degrees C
   experiments, suggesting that subgrain rotation recrystallization is
   active. At temperatures warmer than -20 degrees C, c axes develop a
   crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) characterized by a cone
   (i.e. small circle) around the compression axis. We suggest the c-axis
   cone forms via the selective growth of grains in easy slip orientations
   (i.e. similar to 45 degrees to shortening direction) by GBM. The opening
   angle of the c-axis cone decreases with strain, suggesting
   strain-induced GBM is balanced by grain rotation. Furthermore, the
   opening angle of the c-axis cone decreases with temperature. At -30
   degrees C, the c-axis CPO changes from a narrow cone to a cluster,
   parallel to compression, with increasing strain. This closure of the
   c-axis cone is interpreted as the result of a more active grain rotation
   together with a less effective GBM. We suggest that lattice rotation,
   facilitated by intracrystalline dis- location glide on the basal plane,
   is the dominant mechanism controlling grain rotation. Low-angle
   neighbour-pair misorientations, relating to subgrain boundaries, are
   more extensive and extend to higher misorientation angles at lower
   temperatures and higher strains supporting a relative increase in the
   importance of dislocation activity. As the temperature decreases, the
   overall CPO intensity decreases, primarily because the CPO of small
   grains is weaker. High-angle grain boundaries between small grains have
   misorientation axes that have distributed crystallographic orientations.
   This implies that, in contrast to subgrain boundaries, grain boundary
   misorientation is not controlled by crystallography.
   Nucleation during recrystallization cannot be explained by sub- grain
   rotation recrystallization alone.
   Grain boundary sliding of finer grains or a different nucleation
   mechanism that generates grains with random orientations could explain
   the weaker CPO of the fine-grained fraction and the lack of
   crystallographic control on high-angle grain boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is
   associated with increased cardiovascular events, especially in high-risk
   populations.
   OBJECTIVES This study sought to evaluate the influence of LDL-C on the
   incidence of cardiovascular events either following a coronary
   revascularization procedure (percutaneous coronary intervention {[}PCI]
   or coronary artery bypass grafting {[}CABG]) or optimal medical therapy
   alone in patients with established coronary heart disease and type 2
   diabetes (T2DM).
   METHODS Patient-level pooled analysis of 3 randomized clinical trials
   was undertaken. Patients with T2DM were categorized according to the
   levels of LDL-C at 1 year following randomization. The primary endpoint
   was major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events ({[}MACCE] the
   composite of all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and
   nonfatal stroke).
   RESULTS A total of 4,050 patients were followed for a median of 3.9
   years after the index 1-year assessment. Patients whose 1-year LDL-C
   remained >= 100 mg/dl experienced higher 4-year cumulative risk of MACCE
   (17.2\% vs. 13.3\% vs. 13.1\% for LDL-C between 70 and <100 mg/dl and
   LDL-C <70 mg/dl, respectively; p = 0.016). When compared with optimal
   medical therapy alone, patients with PCI experienced a MACCE reduction
   only if 1-year LDL-C was <70 mg/dl (hazard ratio: 0.61; 95\% confidence
   interval: 0.40 to 0.91; p = 0.016), whereas CABG was associated with
   improved outcomes across all 1-year LDL-C strata. In patients with
   1-year LDL-C >= 70 mg/dl, patients undergoing CABG had significantly
   lower MACCE rates as compared with PCI.
   CONCLUSIONS In patients with coronary heart disease with T2DM, lower
   LDL-C at 1 year is associated with improved long-term MACCE outcome in
   those eligible for either PCI or CABG. When compared with optimal
   medical therapy alone, PCI was associated with MACCE reductions only in
   those who achieved an LDL-C <70 mg/dl. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier on

Abstract = {{Equine chorionic gonadotrophin (eCG) is a hormone widely used in
   superovulation protocols because of its follicle-stimulating action,
   which increases reproductive efficiency in animals of productive
   interest. It contains 45\% carbohydrate, 10\% of which is
   N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid). The eCG purification procedures
   from equine serum or plasma are mainly based on chromatographic methods.
   However, before these procedures, it is necessary to follow sample
   pre-conditioning steps, such as several precipitation stages and/or
   ultrafiltration/diafiltration processes. In this work, an efficient
   affinity chromatographic matrix for eCG purification directly from
   plasma was developed. The matrix consisted of chitosan mini-spheres with
   immobilized wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). The matrix allowed 98\%
   adsorption of eCG directly from plasma without any pre-treatment with an
   overall yield of around 60\%. The matrix chosen was able to maintain the
   efficient performance of the purification process for three consecutive
   cycles. Also, the process was scaled-up 500 times in volume and tested
   over seven consecutive cycles maintaining its chromatographic
   performance. The results presented here suggest the potential
   application of this matrix to one-step purification of eCG from plasma.}},

Title = {{I Cannot Read Your Eye Expression: Suicide Attempters Have Difficulties
   in Interpreting Complex Social Emotions}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: The ability to differentiate emotions in social contexts is
   important for dealing with challenging social situations. Suicide
   attempters show some difficulties in emotion recognition that may result
   in hypersensitivity to social stress. However, other studies on the
   recognition of social complex emotions found that suicide attempters
   have similar performances as depressed non-attempters.
   Objectives: To investigate differences in social emotion recognition in
   patients with current Major Depressive Episode (MDE) with and without
   history of suicide attempt.
   Methods: Two hundred and ten patients with MDE were recruited among whom
   115 had lifetime history of suicide attempt (suicide attempters, SA) and
   95 did not (affective controls, AC). Recognition of complex social
   emotions was assessed using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test
   (RMET). Emotions were separated in three valence categories: positive,
   negative, and neutral. Verbal intelligence quotient (IQ) and attention
   were measured with the National Adult Reading Task (NART) and the d2
   test, respectively.
   Results: Mixed logistic regression models adjusted for sex, lifetime
   bipolar disorder, verbal IQ and attention showed that the RMET
   performance for neutral emotions was worse in the SA than AC group (OR =
   0.87 {[}0.75, 0.99]). Furthermore, when violent/serious SA were compared
   to non-violent/non-serious SA and AC, the RMET neutral valence category
   showed a trend for group factor (p < 0.059) and RMET scores were lower
   in the violent/serious SA than AC group (OR = 0.79 {[}0.64, 0.96]).
   Conclusion: Recognition of neutral emotions is poor in SA and this may
   complicate their daily life. Interventions to improve the understanding
   of complex emotions may be helpful to prevent suicidal risk in patients
   with depression.}},

Abstract = {{Ultra-high performance (UHP) cement pastes with 30-50\% of cement (by
   mass) replaced by multiple cement replacement materials are evaluated in
   this study through concise nanomechanical investigations and qualitative
   chemical intensity mapping. Nanomechanical clustering identifies high
   density (HD) C-S-H and an ultra-high stiffness (UHS) phase as the major
   reaction products in very low w/b UHP pastes. Chemical mapping revealed
   HD C-S-H and UHS phases to have similar mean Ca and Si intensities. The
   indentation modulus (M) - hardness (H) relationships for the C-S-H
   phases in the UHP pastes are similar irrespective of their starting
   compositions. The mean Ca/(Si + Al) intensity ratio is found to be lower
   for the UHS phase, and the Al incorporation is noted to be higher. The
   Al incorporation in the C-A-S-H gel is seen to depend more on the Ca/Si
   ratio of the gel rather than on the amount of Al in the starting
   materials. The normalized chemical intensities and ratios of Ca, Si, and
   Al species, along with the mechanical property description provided by
   nanoindentation, allows for further insights into the microstructure of
   complex, heterogeneous systems such as UHPC pastes. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The cement normally applied in carbon capture and storage sites as well

   adsorbent material for the capture of CO2. Different geopolymer
   formulations were used to produce mechanical resistance and CO2
   adsorption capacity materials. The quantification of the reactive oxides

   geopolymerization. The geopolymers were characterized by X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), Brunauer - Emmett - Teller (BET), Scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) and compressive strength analysis. Calcined rice husk
   ash activated by NaOH was found to be the most suitable precursor

Abstract = {{Normalization method (NM) is a practical method for determining the J-R
   curves and fracture toughness of steels. There is some concern, however,
   about the performance of this method on steels with small strain
   hardening exponent and yield strength owing mainly to the assumption of
   infinite strain hardening exponent. This paper intends to analytically
   modify the NM by removing this assumption and incorporating the strain
   hardening in calculating the blunting corrected crack length. This
   modification enables the NM to be applied to steels with small strain
   hardening exponent and yield strength. Experiments are undertaken to
   verify the modified NM (CNM). A comparison of fracture toughness
   determined by CNM with that by the unloading compliance method and NM
   corroborates the improved accuracy of the developed CNM. The paper
   concludes that the developed CNM overcomes the deficiency of the NM for
   steels with small strain hardening exponent and yield strength.}},

Title = {{Comparison of marginal and internal fit of pressed lithium disilicate
   veneers fabricated via a manual waxing technique versus a 3D printed
   technique}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ESTHETIC AND RESTORATIVE DENTISTRY}},
Abstract = {{Objective The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the marginal
   and internal fit of pressed lithium disilicate veneers fabricated from a
   3D printed castable wax resin versus a manual waxing technique.
   Materials and Methods A typodont model central incisor was prepared for
   a porcelain veneer. Following stone model fabrication from a polyvinyl
   siloxane impression, the model was digitized using a laboratory scanner.
   Group 1 veneers were designed digitally and 3D printed with a castable
   wax resin, then pressed. Group 2 veneers were fabricated using a manual
   wax and press approach. Veneers from both groups were bonded to printed
   dies. Following measurements of marginal adaptation under a stereo
   microscope, the dies were sectioned and measurements were made for
   internal adaption. Statistical analysis included a Kolmogorov test and a
   Mann-Whitney U test.
   Results Average marginal gap (mu m) for Group 1 was 40.37 +/- 11.75 and
   50.63 +/- 16.99 for Group 2 (p = 0.51). Average internal gap (mu m) for
   Group 1 was 61.21 +/- 18.20 and 68.03 +/- 14.07 for Group 2 (p = 0.178).
   Conclusion There was no difference in marginal fit or internal fit
   between pressed lithium disilicate veneers fabricated with a 3D printed
   castable resin and those fabricated with a manual waxing technique. The
   use of digital technologies and 3D printing provide significant
   advantages in the fabrication of pressed glass ceramic veneers, with
   marginal and internal adaptation comparable to manual wax and press
   techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Cladosporium omanense has been recently described as a novel endophytic
   fungus from Zygophyllum coccineum in the desert habitat of Oman. The
   ability of this fungus to suppress Pythium aphanidermatum, the cause of
   cucumber and radish damping-off disease, was investigated. In vitro
   results showed effective suppression of P. aphanidermatum by C.
   omanense, producing an inhibition zone of 3.67 mm in dual culture assay.
   Light microscope and scanning electron microscope examination showed
   abnormalities in Pythium hyphae at the inhibition zone. The culture
   filtrate from C. omanense induced cellular leakage from Pythium mycelium
   and inhibited oospore production. A bioassay test was further conducted
   to examine the ability of C. omanense in suppressing P.
   aphanidermatum-induced damping-off disease of cucumber. It showed that
   C. omanense significantly increased the percent surviving cucumber
   seedlings up to 58.9\%. Similarly, the addition of C. omanense
   significantly increased the percent surviving radish seedlings up to
   80.4\%. The in vivo and in vitro suppression effects of C. omanense were
   mainly due to the production of cellulase, beta-1,3-glucanases and
   siderophores in the culture filtrate of C. omanense. This is the first
   report describing the biocontrol efficacy of C. omanense, especially in
   suppressing P. aphanidermatum-induced damping-off of cucumber and
   radish.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we develop a dynamic hybrid local/nonlocal continuum model
   to study wave propagations in a linear elastic solid. The developed
   hybrid model couples, in the dynamic regime, a classical continuum
   mechanics model with a bond-based peridynamic model using the Morphing
   coupling method that introduced in a previous study (Lubineau et al., J
   Mech Phys Solids 60(6):1088-1102, 2012). The classical continuum
   mechanical model is known as a local continuum model, while the
   peridynamic model is known as a nonlocal continuum model. This dynamic
   hybrid model aims to introduce the nonlocal model into the key
   structural domain, in which the dispersions or crack nucleations may
   occur due to flaws, while applying the local model to the rest of the
   structural domain. Both the local and nonlocal continuum domains are
   overlapped in the coupled subdomain. We study the speeds and angular
   frequencies of the plane waves, with small and large wavenumbers
   obtained by the hybrid model and compare them to purely local and purely
   nonlocal solutions. The error of the hybrid model is discussed by
   analyzing the ghost forces, and the work done by the ghost forces is
   considered equivalent to the energy of spurious reflections. One- and
   two-dimensional numerical examples illustrate the validity and accuracy
   of the proposed approach. We show that this dynamic hybrid
   local/nonlocal continuum model can be successfully applied to simulate
   wave propagations and crack nucleations induced by waves.}},

   microfluidic ducts}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{902}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{We examine the effect of gravity and (rotational) inertia on the
   inertial focusing of spherical non-neutrally buoyant particles suspended
   in flow through curved microfluidic ducts. In the neutrally buoyant
   case, examined in Harding et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 875, 2019, pp.
   1-43), the gravitational contribution to the force on the particle is
   exactly zero and the net effect of centrifugal and centripetal forces
   (due to the motion around the curved duct) is negligible. Inertial lift
   force and drag from the secondary fluid flow vortices interact and lead
   to focusing behaviour which is sensitive to the bend radius of the
   device and the particle size (each measured relative to the height of
   the cross-section). In the case of non-neutrally buoyant particles the
   behaviour becomes more complex with the two additional perturbing
   forces. The gravitational force, relative to the inertial lift force,
   scales with the inverse square of the flow velocity, making it a
   potentially important factor for devices operating at low flow rates
   with a suspension of non-neutrally buoyant particles. In contrast, the
   net centripetal/centrifugal force scales with the inverse of the bend
   radius, similar to the drag force from the secondary flow. We examine
   how these forces perturb the stable equilibria within the
   cross-sectional plane to which neutrally buoyant particles ultimately
   migrate.}},

Title = {{Electrokinetic spectra of dilute surfactant-stabilized nano-emulsions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{902}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{An electrokinetic model for a surfactant-stabilized nano-drop under
   oscillatory forcing is solved. This generalizes a model for which an
   analytical solution was recently proposed for large, highly charged
   drops. Calculations of the dynamic electrophoretic mobility and the
   accompanying electrostatic polarization for a single drop provide a
   theoretical foundation for interpreting electrokinetic sonic amplitude
   and complex-conductivity spectra for dilute surfactant-stabilized
   oil-in-water emulsions and bubbly liquids. The model is distinguished
   from earlier models by accounting for the internal fluid and interfacial
   dynamics at finite frequencies (similar to 10(3)-10(7) Hz).). This
   dynamics accounts for the electro-migration, diffusion and advection of
   surfactant ions on the interface, and exchange of these ions with the
   immediately adjacent electrolyte. Surface gradients induce Marangoni
   stresses, which couple to the electrical and hydrodynamic stresses,
   modulating the magnitude and phase of the drop velocity and
   electrostatic polarization induced by the electric field. Of particular
   interest, for sodium dodecyl sulphate stabilized oil-in-water drops, is
   how the high surface-charge density manifests in a breakdown of the
   Smoluchowski-slip approximation, even for drops with very thin diffuse
   layers. More generally, the model furnishes dynamic mobilities for drops
   with arbitrary size and charge, thus permitting appropriate averaging
   for polydisperse systems. Such calculations may help to resolve
   long-standing challenges and controversy with regards to the
   surface-charge density of nano-drops and their macro-scale counterparts,
   and may pave the way to quantitative interpretations of more complex
   dynamic interfacial rheology and exchange kinetics, e.g. for Pickering
   emulsions.}},

Abstract = {{Background Although Moraxella catarrhalis (M. catarrhalis) is a common
   cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), studies investigating
   clinical manifestations of CAP due to M. catarrhalis (MC-CAP) in adults
   are limited. Since S. pneumoniae is the leading cause of CAP globally,
   it is important to distinguish between MC-CAP and CAP due to S.
   pneumoniae (SP-CAP) in clinical practice. However, no past study
   compared clinical characteristics of MC-CAP and SP-CAP by statistical
   analysis. We aimed to clarify the clinical characteristics of MC-CAP by
   comparing those of SP-CAP, as well as the utility of sputum Gram
   staining. Methods This retrospective study screened CAP patients aged
   over 20 years visiting or admitted to Okinawa Miyako Hospital between
   May 2013 and April 2018. Among these, we included patients whom either
   M. catarrhalis alone or S. pneumoniae alone was isolated from their
   sputum by bacterial cultures. Results We identified 134 MC-CAP and 130
   SP-CAP patients. Although seasonality was not observed in SP-CAP, almost
   half of MC-CAP patients were admitted in the winter. Compared to those
   with SP-CAP, MC-CAP patients were older (p < 0.01) and more likely to
   have underlying pulmonary diseases such as asthma and bronchiectasis (p
   < 0.01). Approximately half of asthmatic MC-CAP and SP-CAP patients had
   asthma attacks. Although winter is an influenza season in Japan,
   co-infection with influenza virus was less common in MC-CAP compared to
   SP-CAP patients (3\% vs. 15\%, p < 0.01). Bronchopneumonia patterns on
   X-ray, as well as bronchial wall thickening, bilateral distribution, and
   segmental pattern on CT were more common in MC-CAP patients than in
   SP-CAP patients (p < 0.01). Sputum Gram stain was highly useful method
   for the diagnosis in both MC-CAP and SP-CAP (78.4\% vs. 89.2\%), and
   penicillins were most frequently chosen as an initial treatment for both
   pneumonias. Conclusions This is the first study to show that MC-CAP
   occurred in older people compared to SP-CAP, influenza virus
   co-infection was less common in MC-CAP than SP-CAP, and that MC-CAP
   frequently caused asthma attacks. Gram stain contributed for the
   appropriate treatment, resulting in conserving broad-spectrum
   antibiotics such as cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones in both MC-CAP
   and SP-CAP patients.}},

Abstract = {{As one of the most demanded dicarboxylic acids, adipic acid can be
   directly produced from renewable sources. Hexoses from (hemi)cellulose
   are oxidized to aldaric acids and subsequently catalytically
   dehydroxylated. Hitherto performed homogeneously, we present the first
   heterogeneous catalytic process for converting an aldaric acid into
   muconic and adipic acid. The contribution of leached Re from the solid
   pre-reduced catalyst was also investigated with hot-filtration test and
   found to be inactive for dehydroxylation. Corrosive or hazardous
   (HBr/H-2) reagents are avoided and simple alcohols and solid Re/C
   catalysts in an inert atmosphere are used. At 120 degrees C, the
   carboxylic groups are protected by esterification, which prevents
   lactonization in the absence of water or acidic sites. Dehydroxylation
   and partial hydrogenation yield monohexenoates (93 \%). For complete

Abstract = {{Magnesium nanoferrites are gaining a lot of scientific attention because
   of its magnificent dielectric characteristics such as large dielectric
   constant with minute dielectric losses, which make it suitable for
   potential applications such as high frequency, microwave devices,
   switching devices, power, magnetic storage devices, and many more. A
   series of manganese- and silver-substituted magnesium nanoferrites with
   the chemical composition Mg1-yMnyAgxFe2-xO4 (0.1 <= y <= 0.4, 0.0 <= x
   <= 0.3) were synthesized via sol-gel auto-combustion technique for
   reporting the electrical and dielectric study of synthesized specimens.
   In the present investigation, the dc resistivity (rho) of prepared
   nanoferrites goes on decreasing as a function of Ag+ and Mn2+
   concentrations extensively indicate its semi-conductor behavior. From
   the dielectric measurements, dielectric constant (is an element of `)
   increases with the increase in frequency, whereas the dielectric loss
   tangent (tan delta) shows an inverse behavior with the increasing
   frequency, respectively. In relation with the dielectric investigations,
   AC conductivity (sigma(ac)) shows similar behavior to that of dielectric
   constant. Therefore, such materials of high dielectric constant with
   minute dielectric losses make it suitable for the power application.}},

Abstract = {{High-temperature self-lubricating materials based on H13 steel are

   addition and high-temperature testing of the material are studied so

   a temperature of 1250 degrees C. When the contents of Cr2C3 and CaF2 are
   10\%, the mechanical and sintering properties of the composites are
   acceptable. The relative density reaches 80.2\% and the bending strength
   reaches 720.2 MPa. Moreover, CaF2 effectively reduces the friction
   coefficient and wear rate of the material. The friction coefficient
   decreases to a minimum of 0.24, but the wear rate increases to a maximum
   of 7.26 x 10(-5) mm(2)/min at a load of 1065 g. Cr2C3 helps to alleviate
   the oxidation of the composites, and the precipitation of CaF2 causes

   behaviors of CFRP/Al electromagnetic riveted joint}},
Journal = {{MECHANICS OF ADVANCED MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Abstract = {{In this study, electromagnetic riveting (EMR) was proposed to connect
   CFRP/Al structures due to its little damage on composite. The joining
   process and failure behaviors of CFRP/Al joints were studied.
   Specifically, the finite element model was established to analyze the
   joining process. The riveted joints were tested under various loading
   velocities to obtain the failure behaviors. The simulation results
   showed that hole wall of the CFRP and Al sheets had uniform residual
   stresses, and no damage of the CFRP sheet was observed around the hole
   after EMR, indicating that the joint had superior performance. The
   tensile test results showed that the loading speed had a great influence
   on the performance of the joint. The maximum shear force at lower
   loading speeds was less than that at higher loading speeds, while the
   trend of energy absorption was opposite. The main failure position was
   in CFRP with a mix mode of bearing and shear out. Based on the failure
   analysis, a simplified analytical model for the maximum shear load was
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{The flooding and seismic activity analysis clearly shows the urgent need
   for an evaluation planning program to mitigate hazard for the vital
   areas. The Red Sea coastal area is always exposed to the risk of flash
   floods and earthquakes; therefore, the management and determination of
   geo-hazard in these areas are critically important. A risk map was
   produced for the study area by integrated flash flooding and seismicity
   data. Several valuable data have been applied to accomplish this work
   which include ALOS-PALSAR, satellite images, and earthquake data.
   Seismic hazard assessment was performed using probabilistic earthquake
   hazard assessment; Results of the iso-acceleration maps and hazard
   curves for a return period of 475 years showed that the seismic hazard
   values increase from southern to northern parts. The morphometric
   parameter interpretations illustrate that 6 sub-basins (40\% of total
   sub-basins) are of high-flooding hazardous, 5 sub-basins of moderate
   hazard (33.33\%), and 4 of low hazard (26.66\%). Finally, geo-hazard map
   results markedly increase from south to north in the study area. So, we
   recommend that some dams and channels should be constructed in vital
   sites along and at the end of the channel Wadi to protect it against
   flood hazards along the Red Sea Coast for long-term sustainable
   development without problems. These findings can be a potential guide
   for decision-makers in disaster geo-hazard reduction in this interest
   coastal area.}},

Abstract = {{Background Molecular tumor boards (MTBs) provide rational,
   genomics-driven, patient-tailored treatment recommendations. Worldwide,
   MTBs differ in terms of scope, composition, methods, and
   recommendations. This study aimed to assess differences in methods and
   agreement in treatment recommendations among MTBs from tertiary cancer
   referral centers in The Netherlands.
   Materials and Methods MTBs from all tertiary cancer referral centers in
   The Netherlands were invited to participate. A survey assessing scope,
   value, logistics, composition, decision-making method, reporting, and
   registration of the MTBs was completed through on-site interviews with
   members from each MTB. Targeted therapy recommendations were compared
   using 10 anonymized cases. Participating MTBs were asked to provide a
   treatment recommendation in accordance with their own methods. Agreement
   was based on which molecular alteration(s) was considered actionable
   with the next line of targeted therapy.
   Results Interviews with 24 members of eight MTBs revealed that all
   participating MTBs focused on rare or complex mutational cancer
   profiles, operated independently of cancer type-specific
   multidisciplinary teams, and consisted of at least (thoracic and/or
   medical) oncologists, pathologists, and clinical scientists in molecular
   pathology. Differences were the types of cancer discussed and the
   methods used to achieve a recommendation. Nevertheless, agreement among
   MTB recommendations, based on identified actionable molecular
   alteration(s), was high for the 10 evaluated cases (86\%).
   Conclusion MTBs associated with tertiary cancer referral centers in The
   Netherlands are similar in setup and reach a high agreement in
   recommendations for rare or complex mutational cancer profiles. We
   propose a ``Dutch MTB model{''} for an optimal, collaborative, and
   nationally aligned MTB workflow.
   Implications for Practice Interpretation of genomic analyses for optimal
   choice of target therapy for patients with cancer is becoming
   increasingly complex. A molecular tumor board (MTB) supports oncologists
   in rationalizing therapy options. However, there is no consensus on the
   most optimal setup for an MTB, which can affect the quality of
   recommendations. This study reveals that the eight MTBs associated with
   tertiary cancer referral centers in The Netherlands are similar in setup
   and reach a high agreement in recommendations for rare or complex
   mutational profiles. The Dutch MTB model is based on a collaborative and
   nationally aligned workflow with interinstitutional collaboration and
   data sharing.}},

Title = {{Estimation of reliability for multi-component stress-strength model
   based on modified Weibull distribution}},
Journal = {{STATISTICAL PAPERS}},
Abstract = {{This paper is devoted to estimating the reliability of a multi-component
   stress-strength model in an s-out-m (s <= m) system under progressively
   type-II censored modified Weibull data. This type of systems functions
   only if at least s out of m strengths exceed the stress. Maximum
   likelihood and Bayes estimators of the stress-strength reliability based
   on conjugate prior are obtained. The associated confidence and credible
   intervals are also developed. The Lindley's approximation and Markov
   chain Monte Carlo methods are used to compute approximate Bayes
   estimates. Two real data sets representing the excessive drought of
   Shasta Reservoir in California, USA and failure times of software model
   are analyzed for illustrative purposes. Further, Monte Carlo simulations
   are performed to compare the so developed estimates.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Horner syndrome (HS) manifests in unilateral ptosis, miosis,
   enophthalmos, and anhedonia. It is most commonly caused by trauma or
   surgical procedures, but can also occur in pediatric patients as a
   result of tumors, especially neuroblastoma (NBL). The objective of this
   study was to analyze the incidence of HS in patients diagnosed with NBL.
   Methods A retrospective analysis of data collected at the Department of
   Pediatric Oncology, Hematology, and Transplantology from 2004 to 2019
   was performed. The study group included 119 patients younger than 18
   years old, with 62 girls and 57 boys. All of them were diagnosed with a
   neuroblastic tumor. Results Among the 119 patients, eight children
   (6.72\%) were diagnosed with HS associated with NBL. Three of these
   patients presented to the clinic with HS, whereas HS developed after the
   surgical procedure to remove the tumor in four patients. The adrenal
   gland was the most frequent localization of the tumor. However, HS
   occurred more frequently in patients with mediastinum tumors. As a
   presenting symptom, HS occurred in 2 of 11 cases (18.18\%) with
   mediastinum localization. All of the patients with HS were younger than
   2 years old. Conclusion Investigation of the cause of isolated HS is
   crucial because it can be the first symptom of NBL. However, the
   surgical procedure itself increases the risk of HS as a complication of
   NBL treatment.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundUnicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is an effective
   treatment for end-stage, symptomatic unicompartmental osteoarthritis of
   the knee joint. However, patellofemoral joint degeneration is a
   contraindication to medial UKA. Therefore, the objective of this study
   was to evaluate the biomechanical effect of medial UKA using
   fixed-bearing (FB) and mobile-bearing (MB) design prostheses on the
   patellofemoral joint.MethodsA three-dimensional finite-element model of
   a normal knee joint was developed using medical image data. We performed
   statistical analysis for each model. The differences in contact stress
   on the patellofemoral joint and the quadriceps force between the FB and
   MB designs were evaluated under a deep-knee-bend condition.ResultsAt an
   early flexion angle, the results of contact stress showed no significant
   difference between the FB and MB medial UKA models compared with the
   intact model. However, at high flexion angles, we observed a significant
   increase in contact stress with the FB models compared with the intact
   model. On the contrary, in the case of the MB models, we found no
   statistically significant increment compared with the intact model. A
   larger quadriceps force was needed to produce an identical flexion angle
   for both the FB and MB UKA designs than for the intact model. At high
   flexion angles, a significant increase quadriceps force whit the FB
   model compared with the intact model.ConclusionsOur results indicate
   that with medial UKA, the contact stress increased and greater
   quadriceps force was applied to the patellofemoral joint. However,
   performing UKA on a patellofemoral joint with osteoarthritis should not
   be difficult, unless anterior knee pain is present, because the increase
   in contact stress is negligible.}},

Abstract = {{Microplastic contamination of the environment is a major concern but
   detecting such contamination presents a challenge, particularly for
   particles <0.1 mm in size. Community scientists and students who
   participated in a plankton monitoring program and routinely examined
   samples of seawater using bright-field microscopy, often found fragments
   and filaments that were likely of anthropogenic origin. While in some
   cases this was clear from their structure and color, the origin of many
   particles remained questionable. To address this problem, optical
   components were added to microscopes for polarization and fluorescence
   detection. Plastics often show birefringence under crossed-polarizers
   due to alignment of the polymer chains within. They also bind Nile Red
   dye to give green, yellow, or red fluorescence emission, depending on
   the hydrophobicity of the polymer. Fluorescence excitation was achieved
   using a focused blue LED flashlight mounted externally to a microscope
   and emission was detected through a yellow plexiglass or gel filter. The
   required optical components cost a few tens of dollars and can be
   applied to any stereo (dissecting) microscope and most compound
   microscopes. These modifications were tested by community college
   students who set up their own microscopes and reported the presence of
   microplastics in the majority of their plankton samples. The equipment
   was also used at outreach events, where the observation of glowing
   microplastic particles suspended in natural water samples made an
   immediate impression with the public and demonstrated the magnitude of
   the environmental problem.}},

Journal = {{PEERJ}},

Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{1,4-dihydropyridines (1,4-DHP) possess important biochemical and
   pharmacological properties, including antimutagenic and DNA-binding
   activity. The latter activity was first described for water-soluble
   1,4-DHP with carboxylic group in position 4, the sodium salt of the
   1,4-DHP derivative AV-153 among others. Some data show the modification
   of physicochemical properties and biological activities of organic
   compounds by metal ions that form the salts. We demonstrated the
   different affinity to DNA and DNA-protecting capacity of AV-153 salts,
   depending on the salt-forming ion (Na, K, Li, Rb, Ca, Mg). This study
   aimed to use different approaches to collate data on the DNA-binding
   mode of AV-153-Na and five other AV-153 salts. All the AV-153 salts in
   this study quenched the ethidium bromide and DNA complex fluorescence,
   which points to an intercalation binding mode. For some of them, the
   intercalation binding was confirmed using cyclic voltammetry and
   circular dichroism spectroscopy. It was shown that in vitro all AV-153
   salts can interact with four DNA bases. The FTIR spectroscopy data
   showed the interaction of AV-153 salts with both DNA bases and phosphate
   groups. A preference for base interaction was observed as the AV-153
   salts interacted mostly with G and C bases. However, the highest
   differences were detected in the spectral region assigned to phosphate
   groups, which might indicate either conformational changes of DNA
   molecule (B form to A or H form) or partial denaturation of the
   molecule. According to the UV/VIS spectroscopy data, the salts also
   interact with the human telomere repeat, both in guanine quadruplex (G4)
   and single-stranded form; Na and K salts manifested higher affinity to
   G4, Li and Rb -to single-stranded DNA.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a reflector antenna with a
   microstrip-patch-array offset feed. The proposed antenna offers several
   advantages in design flexibility, especially to determine the horizontal
   and vertical beam patterns by the modular feed and the reflector
   curvature design, respectively. Moreover, it provides an internal tuning
   mechanism in the form of a tuning strip which is relatively simple to
   apply. The paper describes the steps in a parametric study carried out
   to minimize the antenna dimensions. The resulting optimized design is
   found to be around 50\% smaller in dimension than the initial design of
   the proposed antenna. A demonstrator for experimental analysis,
   consisting of a transmit and a receive antenna, has been constructed,
   and the isolation between the antennas is found to be better than 70 dB.
   The antenna demonstrator has been integrated with an FMCW radar
   transceiver and satisfactorily tested to operate as a coastal
   surveillance radar.}},

Title = {{Long noncoding RNA H19 acts as a miR-29b sponge to promote wound healing
   in diabetic foot ulcer}},
Journal = {{FASEB JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2021}},

Abstract = {{Aberrant expression of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) H19 and microRNA
   (miR)-29b has been implicated in the complications of diabetes mellitus
   (DM). As a common and important complication of DM, diabetic foot ulcer
   (DFU) is characterized by high incidence and poor prognosis. Herein, we
   explored the role of lncRNA H19 in wound healing of DFU. Differentially
   expressed DM-related lncRNAs were initially screened by microarray data
   analysis. DFU models were then induced in DM mouse models. The
   functional role and interaction of lncRNA H19, miR-29b and FBN1 in DFU
   were subsequently determined by examining the proliferation, migration,
   and apoptosis of fibroblasts after silencing H19, inhibiting or
   overexpressing miR-29b and FBN1. According to microarray-based analysis,
   lncRNA H19 was upregulated in DM. In the ulcerative edge tissues of DFU,
   high expression of lncRNA H19 and FBN1 and low expression of miR-29b
   were observed. FBN1 was identified to be a target gene of miR-29b.
   LncRNA H19 could competitively bind to miR-29b, and then, inhibited its
   expression, which consequently upregulating FBN1. Silencing of lncRNA
   H19 led to inhibited proliferation, migration, and enhanced apoptosis of
   fibroblasts, accompanied by downregulated FBN1 but upregulated miR-29b,
   which diminished the expression of TGF-beta 1, Smad3, FN, and Col-1 and
   reduced extracellular matrix accumulation. Altogether, upregulation of
   lncRNA H19 can elevate the expression of FBN1 through competitively
   binding to miR-29b, which enhances the proliferation, migration, and
   inhibits apoptosis of fibroblasts, thus facilitating the wound healing
   of DFU.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, visible light-driven organic photochemical synthesis has been
   a pioneering field of interest from academic and industrial associations
   due to its unique features of green and sustainable chemistry. Herein,
   WO3ZnO/Fe3O4 was synthesized, characterized, and used as an efficient
   magnetic photocatalyst in the preparation of a range of 2-substituted
   benzimidazoles via the condensation of benzyl alcohol and
   o-phenylenediamine in ethanol at room temperature for the first time.
   The key feature of this work is focused on the in situ photocatalytic
   oxidation of benzyl alcohols to benzaldehydes under atmospheric air and
   in the absence of any further oxidant. This new heterogeneous
   nanophotocatalyst was characterized via XRD, FT-IR, VSM and SEM. Short
   reaction time, cost-effectiveness, broad substrate scope, easy work-up
   by an external magnet, and excellent product yield are the major
   advantages of the present methodology. A number of effective

Title = {{A coral-like hematite photoanode on a macroporous SnO2: Sb substrate for
   enhanced photoelectrochemical water oxidation}},
Journal = {{ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{360}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Oxygen evolution over semiconductor photoanodes plays a decisive role in
   water splitting via photoelectrochemical (PEC) process. While the
   hematite photoanode with a photocurrent threshold of 600 nm is promising
   for practical PEC water oxidation, it still suffers from the small
   minority carrier diffusion length, which makes it difficult to realize
   adequate light absorption and efficient charge separation concurrently.
   To address this issue, hematite nanorods were grown on macroporous
   SnO2:Sb substrates, forming a coral-like hematite (ATO-Fe2O3)
   photoanode. The ATO-Fe2O3 photoanode exhibited a 150 mV cathodic shift
   of onset relative to Fe2O3 nanorods directly on planar SnO2:F
   (FTO-Fe2O3). The photocurrent density reached 1.32 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V
   vs. RHE, approximately 8.8 times higher than FTO-Fe2O3, and it was
   further increased to 1.81( )mA cm(-2) after passivation with a thin TiO2
   overlayer. The improved photocurrent was attributed to the increased
   light harvesting, reduced charge transfer resistance (R-ct), and smaller
   contact area of oxygen bubble to hematite photoanode. Our research
   confirmed the effectiveness of macroporous ATO templated coral-like
   morphology on balancing the adequate light absorption and efficient
   charge separation issues of hematite photoanodes. This research may also
   be applicable to other semiconductor photoanodes for high-efficiency PEC
   water splitting. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS LETTERS B}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{810}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{We use a set of hadronic equations of state derived from covariant
   density functional theory to study the impact of their high-density
   behavior on the properties of rapidly rotating Delta-resonance-admixed
   hyperonic compact stars. In particular, we explore systematically the
   effects of variations of the bulk energy isoscalar skewness, Q(sat), and
   the symmetry energy slope, L-sym, on the masses of rapidly rotating
   compact stars. With models for equation of state satisfying all the
   modern astrophysical constraints, excessively large gravitational masses
   of around 2.5 M-circle dot are only obtained under three conditions: (a)
   strongly attractive Delta-resonance potential in nuclear matter, (b)
   maximally fast (Keplerian) rotation, and (c) parameter ranges Q(sat)
   greater than or similar to 500 MeV and L-sym less than or similar to 50
   MeV. These values of Q(sat) and L-sym have a rather small overlap with a
   large sample (total of about 260) parametrizations of covariant
   nucleonic density functionals. The extreme nature of requirements
   (a)-(c) reinforces the theoretical expectation that the secondary object
   involved in the GW190814 event is likely to be a low-mass black hole
   rather than a supramassive neutron star. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

Title = {{Multi-omics analysis reveals that natural hibernation is crucial for
   oocyte maturation in the female Chinese alligator}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundHibernation in an appropriate environment not only is
   important for the survival of hibernators in winter, but also is crucial
   for breeding in the following season for many hibernating species.
   However, the genetic and epigenetic mechanism underlying this process
   remain unclear. In the current study, we performed an integrative
   multi-omics analysis of gonads collected from Chinese alligators that
   overwintered in wild cave and artificial warmroom to explore
   transcriptomic and epigenomic alternations in these organs.ResultsThe
   data revealed that in the breeding season, female alligators were more
   strongly affected in terms of gene expression than males by
   non-hibernation because of overwintering in a warm room, especially for
   genes related to oocyte maturation, and this effect commenced in winter
   with the downregulation of STAR, which is the rate limiting factor of
   steroid biosynthesis. Further, miRNAs were found to play essential roles
   in this negative effect of overwintering in the warm room on
   hibernation. The upregulated miRNAs likely were responsible for the
   suppression of oocyte maturation in the breeding season. Finally, DNA
   methylome changes, especially hypomethylation, were found to play an
   important role in the alterations in ovarian function-related gene
   expression induced by non-hibernation.ConclusionsOur study revealed the
   crucial role of hibernation quality for oocyte maturation in the Chinese
   alligator and the underlying genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, and
   highlights the importance of habitat, and especially, the overwintering
   site, in the conservation of not only the Chinese alligator, but also
   other endangered hibernators.}},

   scales from biochemical reaction networks in single cells to food webs
   of ecosystems. How exponential growth emerges in nonlin-ear systems is
   mathematically unclear. Here, we describe a general theoretical
   framework that reveals underlying principles of longterm growth:
   scalability of flux functions and ergodicity of the rescaled systems.
   Our theory shows that nonlinear fluxes can generate not only balanced
   growth but also oscillatory or chaotic growth modalities, explaining
   nonequilibrium dynamics observed in cell cycles and ecosystems. Our
   mathematical framework is broadly useful in predicting long-term growth
   rates from natural and synthetic networks, analyzing the effects of
   system noise and perturbations, validating empirical and
   phenomenological laws on growth rate, and studying autocatalysis and
   network evolution.}},

Title = {{In Vitro Infrared Thermographic Assessment of Temperature Change in the
   Pulp Chamber during Provisionalization: Effect of Remaining Dentin
   Thickness}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Interim crowns and partial fixed dental prosthesis materials generate
   exothermic heat during polymerization. The amount of heat transmitted to
   the pulp chamber can be a function of several factors, including the
   thickness and quality of the remaining dentin after crown preparation.
   The aim of this in vitro study was to measure with infrared thermography
   the temperature changes on the adjacent surface of the chamber roof of
   premolar teeth extracted from young and old patients (having different
   thicknesses of remaining dentin after crown preparation) during
   fabrication of provisional resinous restorations. Twenty extracted human
   first and second maxillary premolar teeth (10 from young patients, with
   a relatively large pulp chamber, and 10 from older patients, with a
   relatively small pulp chamber) were used. The roots were sectioned to
   expose the inner side of the chamber roof, and the crowns were
   provisionalized after preparation for a metal-ceramic crown. Two
   provisional materials, Turbo Temp 2 and Luxatemp Fluorescence, were
   used. Temperature changes on the inner side of the chamber roof were
   measured at 2-second intervals using an infrared thermal imaging camera.
   After completion of the temperature recordings, the teeth were sectioned
   and the remaining dentin thickness was determined. The older group (mean
   thickness: 2.82 mm) and younger group (mean thickness: 1.9 mm) differed
   significantly in dentin thickness (P<0.014). The mean greatest
   temperature increases recorded on the chamber roof of teeth with less
   remaining dentin were 4.07 degrees C for Turbo Temp 2 and 3.94 degrees C
   for Luxatemp Fluorescence, while increases in the premolars with greater
   dentin thickness were 1.69 degrees C for Turbo Temp 2 and 1.64 degrees C
   for Luxatemp Fluorescence. Significant interactions were found between
   tooth groups (P<0.000001for Turbo Temp 2 and for Luxatemp Fluorescence).
   No significant differences were found between assessed materials
   regardless of the thickness of the remaining dentin (P>0.38for the older
   group and P>0.29 for the younger group). Dentin had a significant effect
   in limiting the temperature increase generated during polymerization of
   provisional materials, indicating good thermal insulating properties of
   this tissue. A remaining dentin thickness of 1.9 mm or more is
   sufficient to protect the pulp from any temperature increase during
   provisionalization using tested materials.}},

Abstract = {{Performing fast qualitative identification of seized illegal drugs by
   Raman spectroscopy is challenging due to fluorescence interference as
   well as chemical complexity. Spectrometers with 785-nm excitation,
   1,064-nm excitation, and sequentially shifted excitation (SSE) were
   compared for their effect on fluorescence reduction. The characteristic
   peaks method, which is independent of cutting agents, was tested as a
   new strategy to broaden the application of the Raman technique. The
   suitability of the characteristic peaks method was fully examined by
   analyzing a large amount of seized illegal drugs, including 72
   methamphetamine hydrochloride (concentration range of 13.9\%-99.4\%), 68
   ketamine hydrochloride (17.7\%-99.8\%), 176 heroin hydrochloride
   (5.2\%-79.5\%), 51 cocaine hydrochloride (21.1\%-94.5\%), and 33 cocaine
   base (30.9\%-92.5\%) samples. The results showed that seized
   methamphetamine, ketamine, and cocaine samples had no or little
   fluorescence. Hence, in regard to detection of these samples, the
   advantage of using 1,064-nm excitation and SSE compared with 785-nm
   excitation was quite limited. Regarding the heroin samples, a
   significant improvement of the ``high{''} confident positive detected
   rate was evident for 1,064 nm excitation (60.8\%) and SSE (61.4\%),
   compared with 785-nm excitation (13.1\%). However, it was also seen that
   even if 1,064-nm excitation and SSE were applied, the fluorescence of
   heroin samples was still unable to be fully overcome. By using the
   characteristic peaks method, low LOD results of 5\%-20\% were acquired
   for 40 types of drug mixtures, and lower LODs were obtained for the 60\%
   of the drug mixtures compared with library searching method. Raman
   spectroscopy in conjunction with the characteristic peaks method was
   shown to be fast, simple, accurate, and sensitive in the qualitative
   analysis of seized drug samples.}},

Abstract = {{Many parts of the visuomotor system guide daily hand actions, like
   reaching for and grasping objects. Do these regions depend exclusively
   on the hand as a specific body part whose movement they guide, or are
   they organized for the reaching task per se, for any body part used as
   an effector? To address this question, we conducted a neuroimaging study
   with people born without upper limbs-individuals with dysplasia-who use
   the feet to act, as they and typically developed controls performed
   reaching and grasping actions with their dominant effector. Individuals
   with dysplasia have no prior experience acting with hands, allowing us
   to control for hand motor imagery when acting with another effector
   (i.e., foot). Primary sensorimotor cortices showed selectivity for the
   hand in controls and foot in individuals with dysplasia. Importantly, we
   found a preference based on action type (reaching/grasping) regardless
   of the effector used in the association sensorimotor cortex, in the left
   intraparietal sulcus and dorsal premotor cortex, as well as in the basal
   ganglia and anterior cerebellum. These areas also showed differential
   response patterns between action types for both groups. Intermediate
   areas along a posterior-anterior gradient in the left dorsal premotor
   cortex gradually transitioned from selectivity based on the body part to
   selectivity based on the action type. These findings indicate that some
   visuomotor association areas are organized based on abstract action
   functions independent of specific sensorimotor parameters, paralleling
   sensory featureindependence in visual and auditory cortices in people
   born blind and deaf. Together, they suggest association cortices across
   action and perception may support specific computations, abstracted from
   low-level sensorimotor elements.}},

Abstract = {{The large demand for safe and efficient viral vector-based vaccines and
   gene therapies against both inherited and acquired diseases accelerates
   the development of viral vectors. One outstanding example, the Orf
   virus, has a wide range of applications, a superior efficacy and an
   excellent safety profile combined with a reduced pathogenicity compared
   to other viral vectors. However, besides these favorable attributes, an
   efficient and scalable downstream process still needs to be developed.
   Recently, we screened potential chromatographic stationary phases for
   Orf virus purification. Based on these previous accomplishments, we
   developed a complete downstream process for the cell culture-derived Orf
   virus. The described process comprises a membrane-based clarification
   step, a nuclease treatment, steric exclusion chromatography, and a
   secondary chromatographic purification step using Capto (R) Core 700
   resin. The applicability of this process to a variety of diverse Orf
   virus vectors was shown, testing two different genotypes. These studies
   render the possibility to apply the developed downstream scheme for both
   genotypes, and lead to overall virus yields of about 64 \%, with step
   recoveries of >70 \% for the clarification, and >90 \% for the
   chromatography train. Protein concentrations of the final product are
   below the detection limits, and the final DNA concentration of about 1
   ng per 1E + 06 infective virus units resembles a total DNA depletion of
   96-98 \%.}},

Abstract = {{The paired job scheduling problem seeks to schedule n jobs on a single
   machine, each job consisting of two tasks for which there is a mandatory
   minimum waiting time between the completion of the first task and the
   start of the second task. We provide complexity results for problems
   defined by three commonly used objective functions. We propose an
   integer programming formulation based on a decision diagram
   decomposition that models the objective function and some of the
   challenging constraints in the space of the flow variables stemming from
   the diagrams while enforcing the simpler constraints in the space of the
   original scheduling variables. We then show how to simplify our
   reformulation by projecting out a subset of the flow variables,
   resulting in a lifted reformulation for the problem that can be obtained
   without building the decision diagrams. Computational results show that
   our proposed model performs considerably better than a standard
   time-indexed formulation over a set of randomly generated instances.}},

Abstract = {{In many applications of Bayesian clustering, posterior sampling on the
   discrete state space of cluster allocations is achieved via Markov chain
   Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. As it is typically challenging to design
   transition kernels to explore this state space efficiently, MCMC
   convergence diagnostics for clustering applications are especially
   important. Here we propose a diagnostic tool for discrete-space MCMC,
   focusing on Bayesian clustering applications where the model parameters
   have been integrated out. We construct a Hotelling-type statistic on the
   highest probability states, and use regenerative sampling theory to
   derive its equilibrium distribution. By leveraging information from the
   unnormalized posterior, our diagnostic offers added protection against
   seemingly convergent chains in which the relative frequency of visited
   states is incorrect. The methodology is illustrated with a Bayesian
   clustering analysis of genetic mutants of the flowering plant
   Arabidopsis thaliana.

Title = {{Testing water fluxes and storage from two hydrology configurations

Abstract = {{Plant activity in semi-arid ecosystems is largely controlled by pulses
   of precipitation, making them particularly vulnerable to increased
   aridity that is expected with climate change. Simple bucket-model
   hydrology schemes in land surface models (LSMs) have had limited ability
   in accurately capturing semi-arid water stores and fluxes. Recent, more
   complex, LSM hydrology models have not been widely evaluated against
   semi-arid ecosystem in situ data. We hypothesize that the failure of
   older LSM versions to represent evapotranspiration, ET, in arid lands is
   because simple bucket models do not capture realistic fluctuations in
   upperlayer soil moisture. We therefore predict that including a
   discretized soil hydrology scheme based on a mechanistic description of
   moisture diffusion will result in an improvement in model ET when
   compared to data because the temporal variability of upper-layer soil
   moisture content better corresponds to that of precipitation inputs. To
   test this prediction, we compared ORCHIDEE LSM simulations from (1) a
   simple conceptual 2-layer bucket scheme with fixed hydraulic parameters
   and (2) an 11-layer discretized mechanistic scheme of moisture diffusion
   in unsaturated soil based on Richards equations, against daily and
   monthly soil moisture and ET observations, together with data-derived
   estimates of transpiration/evapotranspiration, T/ET, ratios, from six
   semi-arid grass, shrub, and forest sites in the south-western USA. The
   11-layer scheme also has modified calculations of surface runoff, water
   limitation, and resistance to bare soil evaporation, E, to be compatible
   with the more complex hydrology configuration. To diagnose remaining
   discrepancies in the 11-layer model, we tested two further
   configurations: (i) the addition of a term that captures bare soil
   evaporation resistance to dry soil; and (ii) reduced bare soil
   fractional vegetation cover. We found that the more mechanistic 11-layer
   model results in a better representation of the daily and monthly ET
   observations. We show that, as predicted, this is because of improved
   simulation of soil moisture in the upper layers of soil (top similar to
   10 cm). Some discrepancies between observed and modelled soil moisture
   and ET may allow us to prioritize future model development and the
   collection of additional data. Biases in winter and spring soil moisture
   at the forest sites could be explained by inaccurate soil moisture data
   during periods of soil freezing and/or underestimated snow forcing data.
   Although ET is generally well captured by the 11-layer model, modelled
   T/ET ratios were generally lower than estimated values across all sites,
   particularly during the monsoon season. Adding a soil resistance term
   generally decreased simulated bare soil evaporation, E, and increased
   soil moisture content, thus increasing transpiration, T, and reducing
   the negative bias between modelled and estimated monsoon T/ET ratios.
   This negative bias could also be accounted for at the low-elevation
   sites by decreasing the model bare soil fraction, thus increasing the
   amount of transpiring leaf area. However, adding the bare soil
   resistance term and decreasing the bare soil fraction both degraded the
   model fit to ET observations. Furthermore, remaining discrepancies in
   the timing of the transition from minimum T/ET ratios during the hot,
   dry May-June period to high values at the start of the monsoon in
   July-August may also point towards incorrect modelling of leaf phenology
   and vegetation growth in response to monsoon rains.
   We conclude that a discretized soil hydrology scheme and associated
   developments improve estimates of ET by allowing the modelled
   upper-layer soil moisture to more closely match the pulse precipitation
   dynamics of these semi-arid ecosystems; however, the partitioning of T
   from E is not solved by this modification alone.}},

   methods, state-of-the-art classification models, and vis-a-vis their
   impact on an ASR. As deep learning techniques are very data-dependent
   different speech datasets that are available online are also discussed
   in detail. In the end, the various online toolkits, resources, and
   language models that can be helpful in the formulation of an ASR are
   also proffered. In this study, we captured every aspect that can impact
   the performance of an ASR. Hence, we speculate that this work is a good

Title = {{Doing adulthood-doing alcohol: what happens when the `sober generation'
   grows up?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF YOUTH STUDIES}},
Abstract = {{Since the 2000s, there has been a worldwide trend of decreased alcohol
   consumption among young people. Although recent studies have given
   multiple explanations for this, we know little about the meaning of
   alcohol for this generation as they enter adulthood. The aim of this
   article is therefore to describe and analyze the age-related views
   toward alcohol among this group as they transition from adolescents to
   adults. The study was based on 39 qualitative interviews with people
   aged 17-21. Theoretical concepts such as doing age and symbolic
   boundaries were used to analyze the material and investigate how age can
   structure alcohol use, and how alcohol consumption can be narrated to
   produce maturity and adulthood. The analysis showed that participants
   presented their relation to alcohol in nuanced and responsible ways,
   signaling maturity. The participants' navigation of acceptable alcohol
   consumption differs in terms of agency and control in different life
   phases. `Doing adulthood' in relation to alcohol for abstainers and
   drinkers seems to center on the same understandings of legitimate
   behavior: being moderate, nuanced, and in control. This focus linked
   alcohol to the position these emerging adults hold in wider society,
   given that participants incorporated societal demands for a neoliberal
   lifestyle.}},

Abstract = {{The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak pandemic is now a global crisis. It has
   caused 9+ million confirmed cases and 400,000+ deaths at the time of
   writing and triggered unprecedented preventative measures that have
   confined a substantial portion of the global population and established
   `social distancing' as a new global behavioral norm. The COVID-19 crisis
   has affected all aspects of everyday life and work, and heavily impacted
   the global economy. This crisis also offers unprecedented insights into
   how the global climate crisis may be managed, as there are many
   parallels between the COVID-19 crisis and what we expect from the
   imminent global climate emergency. Reflecting upon the challenges of
   today's crisis may help us better prepare for the future. Here we
   compile a list, by no means comprehensive, of the similarities and
   differences between the two crises, and the lessons we can learn from
   them: (i) High momentum trends, (ii) Irreversible changes, (iii) Social
   and spatial inequality, (iv) Weakening of international solidarity, and

Title = {{Mitigating Heat Wave and Exposure Damage to ``Cabernet Sauvignon{''}
   Wine Grape With Partial Shading Under Two Irrigation Amounts}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Rising temperatures in most agricultural regions of the world are
   associated with a higher incidence of extreme weather events such as
   heat waves. We performed an experiment to mitigate the impact of heat
   waves and exposure of berries in grapevine (Vitis vinifera cv.
   ``Cabernet Sauvignon{''}) with untreated vines (Exposed) or with
   fruit-zone partial shading (Shaded) under 40 and 80\% replacement of
   crop evapotranspiration (ETc) with sustained deficit irrigation in a
   factorially arranged experiment. The trial was performed in a vineyard
   with vertically shoot positioned trellis with a row orientation that
   concentrated solar radiation exposure on the southwest aspect of the
   fruit zone. Leaf stomatal conductance (g(s)) and net carbon assimilation
   (A(N)) were significantly lower in shaded leaves under partial
   fruit-zone shading that resulted in lower pruning mass for Shaded
   treatments. Stem water potential (psi(stem)) responded to a large extent
   to increased irrigation. However, grapevines with partial fruit-zone
   shading had transiently better water status under 40\% ETc. Cluster
   maximum temperatures were 3.9 degrees C greater in Exposed grapevines.
   Exposed clusters had transiently lower acidity and higher pH. However,
   Exposed clusters on 40\% ETc had higher total soluble solids (TSS). The
   experimental vineyard suffered a 4-day heat wave 21 days before harvest,
   resulting in 25\% of the clusters being damaged in Exposed treatment,
   regardless of irrigation amount. Furthermore, berries in Exposed
   treatments suffered a great loss of anthocyanins and flavonols even if
   they were not damaged by direct solar exposure. The pre-planting
   decision of using a vertically shoot positioned trellis that
   concentrated solar radiation on the Southwest aspect offered mild
   protection in a hot climate region with a sunny growing season with
   extreme heat events during the execution of study. The extreme
   conditions under which this study was conducted are not unusual, and
   have become more expected. Our work provided evidence of the
   vulnerability of grape berry to heat waves and exposure during heat wave
   events and possible protection methods to mitigate these effects in situ
   in context of climate change.}},

Title = {{Deep learning merger masses estimation from gravitational waves signals
   in the frequency domain}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS LETTERS B}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{810}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Detection of gravitational waves (GW) from compact binary mergers
   provides a new window into multimessenger astrophysics. The standard
   technique to determine the merger parameters is matched filtering,
   consisting in comparing the signal to a template bank. This approach can
   be time consuming and computationally expensive due to the large amount
   of experimental data which needs to be analyzed. In the attempt to find
   more efficient data analysis methods we develop a new frequency domain
   convolutional neural network (FCNN) to predict the merger masses from
   the spectrogram of the detector signal, and compare it to time domain
   neural networks (TCNN). Since FCNNs are trained using spectrograms, the
   dimension of the input is reduced as compared to TCNNs, implying a
   substantially lower number of model parameters, and consequently less
   over-fitting. The additional time required to compute the spectrogram is
   approximately compensated by the lower execution time of the FCNNs, due
   to the lower number of parameters. In our analysis FCNNs show a slightly
   better performance on validation data and a substantially lower
   over-fit, as expected due to the lower number of parameters, providing a
   new promising approach to the analysis of GW detectors data, which could
   be further improved in the future by using more efficient and faster
   computations of the spectrogram. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{Social Chemical Communication Determines Recovery From L1 Arrest via
   DAF-16 Activation}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{In a population, chemical communication determines the response of
   animals to changing environmental conditions, what leads to an enhanced
   resistance against stressors. In response to starvation, the nematode
   Caenorhabditis elegans arrest post-embryonic development at the first
   larval stage (L1) right after hatching. As arrested L1 larvae, C.
   elegans become more resistant to diverse stresses, allowing them to
   survive for several weeks expecting to encounter more favorable
   conditions. L1 arrested at high densities display an enhanced resistance
   to starvation, dependent on soluble compounds released beyond hatching
   and the first day of arrest. Here, we show that this chemical
   communication also influences recovery after prolonged periods in L1
   arrest. Animals at high density recovered faster than animals at low
   density. We found that the density effect on survival depends on the
   final effector of the insulin signaling pathway, the transcription
   factor DAF-16. Moreover, DAF-16 activation was higher at high density,
   consistent with a lower expression of the insulin-like peptide DAF-28 in
   the neurons. The improved recovery of animals after arrest at high
   density depended on soluble compounds present in the media of arrested
   L1s. In an effort to find the nature of these compounds, we investigated
   the disaccharide trehalose as putative signaling molecule, since its
   production is enhanced during L1 arrest and it is able to activate
   DAF-16. We detected the presence of trehalose in the medium of arrested
   L1 larvae at a low concentration. The addition of this concentration of
   trehalose to animals arrested at low density was enough to rescue DAF-28
   production and DAF-16 activation to the levels of animals arrested at
   high density. However, despite activating DAF-16, trehalose was not
   capable of reversing survival and recovery phenotypes, suggesting the
   participation of additional signaling molecules. With all, here we
   describe a molecular mechanism underlying social communication that
   allows C. elegans to maintain arrested L1 larvae ready to quickly
   recover as soon as they encounter nutrient sources.}},

Abstract = {{Investigation of the effects of a solvent on the photophysical and redox
   properties of the photoredox catalyst (PC),
   N,N-di(2-naphthyl)-5,10-dihydrophenazine (PC 1), revealed the
   opportunity to use tetrahydrofuran (THF) to modulate the reactivity of
   PC 1 toward achieving a controlled organocatalyzed atom transfer radial
   polymerization (O-ATRP) of acrylates. Compared with dimethylacetamide
   (DMAc), in tetrahydrofuran (THF), PC 1 exhibits a higher quantum yield
   of intersystem crossing (Phi(ISC) = 0.02 in DMAc, 0.30 in THF), a longer
   singlet excited-state lifetime (tau(singlet )= 3.81 ns in DMAc, 21.5 ns
   in THF), and a longer triplet excited-state lifetime (tau(Triplet) = 4.3
   mu s in DMAc, 15.2 mu s in THF). Destabilization of 1(center dot+) the
   proposed polymerization deactivator, in THF leads to an increase in the
   oxidation potential of this species by 120 mV (E(1/2)0 = 0.22 V vs SCE
   in DMAc, 0.34 V vs SCE in THF). The O-ATRP of n-butyl acrylate (n-BA)
   catalyzed by PC 1 proceeds in a more controlled fashion in THF than in
   DMAc, producing P(n-BA) with low dispersity, D (D < 1.2). Model
   reactions and spectroscopic experiments revealed that two
   initiator-derived alkyl radicals add to the core of PC 1 to form an
   alkyl-substituted photocatalyst (2) during the polymerization. PC 2
   accesses a polar CT excited state that is similar to 40 meV higher in
   energy than PC 1 and forms a slightly more oxidizing radical cation
   (E(1/2)0 = 0.22 V for 1(center dot+) and 0.25 V for 2(center dot+) in
   DMAc). A new O-ATRP procedure was developed wherein PC 1 is converted to
   2 in situ. The application of this method enabled the O-ATRP of a number
   of acrylates to proceed with moderate to good control (D = 1.15-1.45 and
   I{*} = 83-127\%).}},

Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   Asylum seekers experience a high burden of physical and psychological
   trauma, yet there is a scarcity of literature regarding the epidemiology
   and sequelae of head injury (HI) in asylum seekers. We examined HI
   prevalence and association with neuropsychiatric comorbidities in asylum
   seekers.
   Methods
   A retrospective cross-sectional study was performed through review of
   139 medical affidavits from an affidavit database. Affidavits written
   from 2010 to 2018 were included. Demographic and case-related data were
   collected and classified based on the presence of HI. For
   neuropsychiatric sequelae, the primary study outcome was headache and
   the secondary outcomes were depression, posttraumatic stress disorder,
   and anxiety. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to examine
   the association between HI and neuropsychiatric sequelae, adjusted for
   demographic and clinical characteristics.
   Results
   A total of 139 medical affidavits of asylum seekers were included. The
   mean age was 27.4 +/- 12.1 years, 56.8\% were female, and 38.8\% were
   <19 years. Almost half (42.5\%) explicitly self-reported history of HI.
   Compared to clients who did not report HI, clients with HI were older
   and more likely to report a history of headache, physical abuse,
   physical trauma, concussion, and loss of consciousness. After adjustment
   for demographic and clinical characteristics, clients with HI had
   greater odds for neuropsychological sequelae such as headache (odds
   ratio {[}OR] 4.2, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 2.0-8.7) and
   depression (OR 2.5, 95\% CI 1.1-5.7).
   Conclusions
   We observed a high prevalence of HI in asylum seekers. Comprehensive
   screening for HI and neuropsychiatric comorbidities is encouraged when
   evaluating asylum seekers.}},

Abstract = {{The design of drug structures that are non-toxic, easily transported and
   permeable to cellular barriers is currently one of the most growing
   research trends. Indeed, the structural similarity of
   2-hydrazinopyrazine (2HP) to pyrazinamide, which has been successfully
   used in anti-tuberculosis therapy, makes 2HP a promising research
   object. Thus, herein, a complete analysis of the structure of 2HP and
   its physicochemical and cytotoxic properties was performed. Calf thymus
   DNA (CT-DNA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) binding studies were
   conducted, which demonstrated the higher affinity of 2HP to BSA.
   Furthermore, cytotoxicity tests were performed, which proved that 2HP
   was non-toxic to human skin keratinocyte cells. Accordingly, 2HP was
   initially classified as a compound with potential application.
   Physicochemical investigations were performed using a wide range of
   experiments, which were supported by DFT calculations using the B3LYP
   functional and 6-311+G{*}{*} basis set. The good correlation, high
   quality and correctness of the obtained parameters were proven although
   the data was obtained using independent techniques. Additionally, 42
   tautomeric (prototrophic) forms of 2HP were found by searching the
   conformational hyperspace. The most energy stable 2HP conformer
   structure and the partial charge distribution were established. The
   preferred 2HP ionic forms preferred were presented, and models of the
   equilibrium occurring in aqueous solution were proposed. The hydrophilic
   character of 2HP was established based on the partition coefficient
   values determined by both experiment and theory. The PCM and SMD solvent
   models of water and n-octanol were used.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Phlebotomy losses greatly contribute to anaemia following preterm
   birth. Therefore, the possibility of drawing initial tests from the
   placenta seems attractive. There is a lack of literature regarding the
   feasibility and accuracy of pathology tests taken from umbilical
   arterial and venous (UAB/UVB) compared to blood collected from the
   newborn.
   Methods UAB and UVB complete blood pictures were compared with the
   initial neonatal blood test. The relationship between UAB, UVB and
   neonatal complete blood picture values was determined by Spearman's Rho
   correlation with absolute values compared by Kruskal-Wallis. P < 0.05
   was considered significant.
   Results Neonatal haemoglobin, white cell count, immature/total ratio and
   platelets were significantly correlated to the corresponding values in
   the UAB and UVB (all P < 0.001). While UAB and UVB haemoglobin and white
   cell count were similar, both were significantly lower than the neonatal
   values (P < 0.001 and P = 0.014, respectively). No difference was seen
   for immature/total ratio and platelet concentrations. UVB blood culture
   (BC) was feasible (90\%), even with delayed cord clamping, and the UVB
   BC volume was significantly higher (P < 0.001), with a low rate of BC
   contamination (1.5\%).
   Conclusions Our findings support the feasibility and accuracy of
   umbilical blood in place of blood collected from the newborn. This
   reduces the phlebotomy losses and allows higher blood volume collection
   which may increase the sensitivity of BC collection.}},

Title = {{Neotectonics and pastoralism: How they impact flood regimes in
   Madagascar's highlands}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{742}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Sustainably maintaining the densely populated upland plains of
   Madagascar as operationally safe spaces for the food security of the
   nation and the urban growth of its capital city, Antananarivo, hinges
   critically on avoiding crop and infrastructure destruction by their
   through-flowing rivers. The flood regime, however, is also a function of
   two `slow' variables hitherto undocumented: tectonic subsidence regime,
   and floodplain sedimentation rate. From a radiocarbon-dated
   chronostratigraphy and environmental history of the sediment sequences
   in three of Madagascar's semi-enclosed upland basins (Antananarivo,
   Arnbohibary, and Alaotra), we quantify and compare how the precarious
   equilibrium between the two variables entails differentials in
   accommodation space for sediment and floodwater. Results show that all
   these plains have been wetlands for at least 40,000 years, but that the
   Antananarivo Basin is the most vulnerable because the imbalance between
   sedimentation and subsidence is the largest. Although the tectonic
   regime and the endemic forms of gully erosion that occur in the
   catchments are beyond human control, we advocate that flood mitigation
   strategies should focus on the natural grassland savanna, which makes up
   most of the contributing areas to surface runoff in the watersheds.
   Pastoralists are persistently left out of rural development programmes,
   yet the rangelands could benefit from the introduction of multi-purpose
   grasses and legumes known to withstand high stocking rates on poor soils
   while combining the benefits of nutritiousness, fire and drought
   resistance, with good runoff-arrest and topsoil-retainment abilities.
   Future-proofing Madagascar's upland grainbaskets and population centres
   thus calls for joined-up action on the sediment cascade, focusing on
   soil and water sequestration through integrated watershed management
   rather than on hard-defence engineering against overflowing rivers on
   the plains, which has been the costly but ineffectual approach since the
   17th century. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{An Efficient Quantum-Dot Cellular Automata Full Adder Based on a New
   Convertible 7-Input Majority-Not Gate}},
Journal = {{IETE JOURNAL OF RESEARCH}},
Abstract = {{Quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) is one of the most promising
   emerging paradigms offered for substitution of ongoing MOSFET
   technology. In order to qualify the QCA technology, all the previously
   designed circuits, either combinational or sequential, have been
   redesigned using QCA cell interaction. In this way, adder circuits,
   which play the most significant role in the arithmetic structures, have
   been extensively explored. In this paper, in the first step, a new
   single-layer 7-input majority-not gate is presented. This gate can be
   easily converted to a 5- or 7-input majority gate to form diverse QCA
   circuits. The extensive energy dissipation and structural evaluations
   over the proposed 5-input majority gate and the best previously
   published ones prove its prominent performance. In the next step, this
   well-shaped gate is leveraged as a basilar structure for implementation
   of an ultra-high speed QCA full adder. With respect to the counterpart
   designs, our proposed one surpasses all the previously published full
   adders in different points of views such as computation speed and number
   of consumed cells. QCADesigner and QCAPro tools are used as popular
   simulation engines to authenticate the circuit functioning and to
   measure energy dissipation, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Aim In a context of successive fruit fly invasions (Tephritidae), this
   study investigated how the top invader, Bactrocera dorsalis, displaced
   established fruit fly populations. We focused, particularly, on how this
   invasion impacted the host range and climatic niche of each resident
   species.
   Location La Reunion, France, Indian Ocean.
   Methods We collected fruit from more than 100 plant species across the
   island, in cultivated and non-cultivated areas at different altitudes in
   order to monitor the emergence of fruit flies. Fruit collection was
   conducted over two field campaigns: from 2001 to 2009, before the B.
   dorsalis invasion; and from 2018 to 2019, after the B. dorsalis
   invasion. We compared the distribution and host range of fruit fly
   species for the two periods.
   Results Our results confirmed the generalist character of B. dorsalis,
   with the infestation of 52 out of 112 of the fruit species collected in
   the field. After the B. dorsalis invasion, we observed a shift in the
   host range and spatial distribution of established tephritids. The host
   range of specialist species that only share a few host species with B.
   dorsalis did not change significantly. On the contrary, we observed a
   significant shift in diversity or proportion of host range and climatic
   niches for the generalist species, such as Bactrocera zonata, Ceratitis
   quilicii and Ceratitis capitata.
   Main conclusions We provide evidence of the competitive displacement
   induced by B. dorsalis on other established species. The coexistence
   between B. dorsalis and generalist Ceratitis species seems possible
   because they have different responses to climatic conditions or the
   capacity to exploit other host fruit species. In contrast, the
   coexistence of B. zonata with B. dorsalis seems to be compromised
   because both species have similar ecological requirements. This research
   provides useful information for managing invasions, particularly since
   understanding competitive displacements is essential for the
   identification of empty niches and for modelling potential species
   distribution.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{32}},

Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Spectrum sharing protocols for cognitive radio networks (CRNs) are often
   designed based on an exclusive channel occupancy policy. This policy
   does not allow concurrent cognitive radio (CR) transmissions to take
   place over the same channel. Unfortunately, this can significantly
   affect spectrum utilization and network performance. Allowing several
   secondary users to simultaneously share the same channel naturally
   improves spectrum utilization and avoids unnecessary blocking of CR
   transmissions. The key challenge in enabling efficient operation of
   multichannel CRNs is how to perform efficient power-controlled
   media-access-control (MAC) protocols. These protocols include both power
   control and channel assignment. In this paper, we propose a
   power-controlled MAC protocol for CRNs based on interference-channel
   occupancy model with the objective of maximizing the number of served CR
   transmissions. It uses a novel power-controlled channel assignment
   mechanism that allows several concurrent interference-limited
   transmissions to simultaneously proceed over each idle channel in the
   same neighborhood. We present two variants of the power-controlled
   channel assignment mechanism. The first proposed variant is suitable for
   CRNs with fixed data packet size, whereas the other is suitable for
   dynamic CRNs with variable packet size. The second variant of our
   protocol employs a users' scheduling procedure that attempts to fully
   utilize the available time-frequency blocks. Simulation results indicate
   that employing transmission power control along with appropriate channel
   assignment and users' scheduling in CRNs can significantly improve the
   spectrum utilization and the overall network performance.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives
   Islet transplantation is an emerging treatment option for type 1
   diabetes but its application is limited by the shortage of human
   pancreas donors. Characterization of the N- and O-glycan surface
   antigens that vary between human and genetically engineered porcine
   islet donors could shed light on targets of antibody mediated rejection.
   Methods
   N- and O-glycans were isolated from human and adult porcine islets and
   analyzed using matrix-assisted laser-desorption time-of-flight mass
   spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and electrospray ionization mass
   spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS).
   Results
   A total of 57 porcine and 34 human N-glycans and 21 porcine and 14 human
   O-glycans were detected from cultured islets. Twenty-eight of which were
   detected only from porcine islets, which include novel xenoantigens such
   as high-mannose type N-glycans with core fucosylation and complex-type
   N-glycans with terminal neuraminic acid residues. Porcine islets have
   terminal N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc) residue in bi-antennary
   N-glycans and sialyl-Tn O-glycans. No galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose
   (alpha-Gal) or Sd(a) epitope were detected on any of the islets.
   Conclusions
   These results provide important insights into the potential antigenic
   differences of N- and O-glycan profiles between human and porcine
   islets. Glycan differences may identify novel gene targets for genetic
   engineering to generate superior porcine islet donors.}},

Title = {{Future projections of flood dynamics in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{742}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{The annual flood pulse of the Mekong River is crucial to sustain
   agriculture production, nutrition, and the livelihood of millions of
   people living in the Vietnamese part of the Mekong Delta (VMD). However,
   climate change impacts on precipitation, temperature and sea-level
   combined with land subsidence, upstream hydropower development, and
   water infrastructures (i.e. high-dykes construction) are altering the
   hydrological regime of the VMD. This study investigates future changes
   in flood hazard and agricultural production caused by these different
   scales of human-induced stresses. A quasi- two-dimensional (quasi-2D)
   hydrodynamic model was used to simulate eight scenarios representing the
   individual and compound impacts of these drivers for a baseline
   (1971-2000) and future (2036-2065) period. The scenarios map the most
   likely future pathway of climate change (RCP 4.5) combined with the best
   available Mekong upstream hydropower development, and land subsidence
   scenarios as well as the current delta development plan. We found that
   sea-level rise and land subsidence would cause the highest changes in
   flood hazard and damage to rice crop, followed by hydropower and climate
   change impacts. Expansion of high-dyke areas in two northernmost delta
   provinces (An Giang and Dong Thap) would have the smallest impact. The
   combination of all modelled drivers is projected to increase delta
   inundation extent by 20\%, accompanied with prolonging submergence of
   1-2 months, and 2-3 times increase in annual flood damage to rice crops
   in the flood-prone areas of the VMD. These findings of likely increasing
   risk of tidal induced flood hazard and damage call for well-planned
   adaptation and mitigation measures, both structural and non-structural.

Title = {{Combining transdermal and breath alcohol assessments, real-time drink
   logs and retrospective self-reports to measure alcohol consumption and
   intoxication across a multi-day music festival}},
Journal = {{DRUG AND ALCOHOL REVIEW}},
Abstract = {{Introduction and Aims Comprehensively investigating alcohol-related
   behaviours in the context of a dynamic multi-day alcohol-licensed event
   is important for understanding and minimising patron risk. We aimed to
   assess the measurement utility of implementing a multi-dimensional
   alcohol assessment battery using biometric data collection, real-time
   drink logs and retrospective self-report measures over the course of a
   4-day music festival.
   Methods Fourteen adults participated (n = 7 male, mean age 21.9 years).
   Breath and transdermal alcohol concentration (BrAC and TAC,
   respectively) were measured using breathalysers and transdermal alcohol
   bracelets. A real-time drink log was completed via smartphones on
   initiating each drink, and a retrospective questionnaire was
   administered up to twice daily throughout the event (6 timepoints
   total).
   Results While almost all participants (92.9\%) logged significantly
   fewer drinks in real-time than they retrospectively reported via the
   twice-daily questionnaires, logs provided important contextual
   information including the types of drinks consumed and drinking
   intensity. Compared to BrAC, TAC provided a better understanding of the
   time course of intoxication, indicating highest alcohol consumption
   outside of static BrAC assessment windows. However, BrAC provided a
   better assessment of present state: all participants were 0.00\% BrAC at
   departure despite over two-fifths (42.9\%) of the sample's last TAC
   reading exceeding 0.00\%.
   Conclusions As standalone assessments, each method possessed
   limitations. As a combined battery, they were successfully administered
   simultaneously, resulting in a more comprehensive overview of alcohol
   consumption/intoxication over the prolonged drinking session. However,
   the marked burden of simultaneous administration should be considered,
   and measures should be chosen judiciously based on research needs.}},

Abstract = {{Self-assembly is a characteristic property of soft matter. Understanding
   the factors which assist or perturb this process is of great importance
   in many biological and industrial processes. Amphiphiles self-assemble
   and order into a variety of structures including well-ordered lamellar
   phases. The present work uses neutron reflectometry and neutron
   scattering to explore the effects of both interface roughness and
   temperature on the lamellar-phase structure of a non-ionic surfactant at
   a solid/liquid interface. The structure of concentrated solutions of
   tetraethyleneglycol dodecyl ether has been compared against a smooth
   surface and one with a roughness of the order of the lamellar spacing.
   This has been done in order to investigate the role perturbations have
   on the overall lamellar order, when these have length scales of the
   order of the interactions between neighboring lamellae. The results
   showed that the surfactant forms a well-ordered and aligned structure at
   a smooth surface, extending to a depth of several micrometers from the
   interface. Increasing the temperature of the sample and subsequent
   cooling promotes alignment and increases the number of oriented layers
   at the surface. The same sample forms a significantly less aligned
   structure against a rough surface that does not align to the same
   extent, even after heating. The perturbation of the structure caused by
   thermal fluctuations was found to be much less than that imposed by a
   small surface roughness.}},

Abstract = {{Background Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) causes severe episodic, unilateral
   facial pain and is initially treated with antiepileptic medications. For
   patients not responding or intolerant to medications, surgery is an
   option. Methods In order to expand understanding of the pain-related
   burden of illness associated with TN, a cross-sectional survey was
   conducted of patients at a specialist center that utilizes a
   multidisciplinary care pathway. Participants provided information
   regarding their pain experience and treatment history, and completed
   several patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures. Results Of 129
   respondents, 69/128 (54\%; 1 missing) reported no pain in the past 4
   weeks. However, 84 (65\%) respondents were on medications, including 49
   (38\%) on monotherapy and 35 (27\%) on polytherapy. A proportion of
   patients had discontinued at least one medication in the past, mostly
   due to lack of efficacy (n = 62, 48\%) and side effects (n = 51, 40\%).
   A total of 52 (40\%) patients had undergone surgery, of whom 30 had
   microvascular decompression (MVD). Although surgery, especially MVD,
   provided satisfactory pain control in many patients, 29\% of
   post-surgical patients reported complications, 19\% had pain worsen or
   stay the same, 48\% were still taking pain medications for TN, and 33\%
   reported new and different facial pain. Conclusions In most PRO
   measures, respondents with current pain interference had poorer scores
   than those without pain interference. In the Patient Global Impression
   of Change, 79\% expressed improvement since beginning of treatment at
   this clinic. These results indicate that while the multidisciplinary
   approach can substantially alleviate the impact of TN, there remains an
   unmet medical need for additional treatment options.}},

Abstract = {{Objective The pathophysiologic events that precede the onset of
   rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remain incompletely understood. This study was
   undertaken to identify changes in the serum proteome that precede the
   onset of RA, with the aim of providing new insights into the pathogenic
   mechanisms that lead to its development.
   Methods In a cohort of first-degree relatives of Indigenous North
   American RA patients, the SomaScan proteomics platform was used to
   determine the levels of 1,307 proteins in multiple longitudinal serum
   samples from 17 individuals who were followed up prospectively to the
   time of disease onset. Proteomic signatures from this group of
   individuals (designated the progressor group) were compared to those in
   a group of individuals who were considered at risk of developing RA,
   stratified as either positive (n = 63) or negative (n = 47) for
   anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) (designated the at-risk
   group). Machine learning was used to identify a protein signature that
   could accurately classify those individuals at highest risk of future RA
   development.
   Results A preclinical proteomic signature that differentiated RA
   progressors from at-risk individuals, irrespective of ACPA status, was
   identified (area under the curve 0.913, accuracy 91.2\%). Importantly,
   the predictive preclinical proteomic signature was present not only in
   serum samples obtained close to the onset of RA, but also in serum
   samples obtained a median of 30.9 months prior to onset. Network
   analysis implicated the activation of Toll-like receptor 2 and
   production of tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1 as key events that
   precede RA progression.
   Conclusion Alterations in the serum proteome in the preclinical phase of
   RA can emerge years prior to the onset of disease. Our findings suggest
   that the serum proteome provides a rich source of proteins serving both
   to classify at-risk individuals and to identify molecular pathways
   involved in the development of clinically detectable RA.}},

Title = {{A data model for enhanced data comparability across multiple
   organizations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIG DATA}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Organizations may be related in terms of similar operational procedures,
   management, and supervisory agencies coordinating their operations.
   Supervisory agencies may be governmental or non-governmental but, in all
   cases, they perform oversight functions over the activities of the
   organizations under their control. Multiple organizations that are
   related in terms of oversight functions by their supervisory agencies,
   may differ significantly in terms of their geographical locations, aims,
   and objectives. To harmonize these differences such that comparative
   analysis will be meaningful, data about the operations of multiple
   organizations under one control or management can be cultivated, using a
   uniform format. In this format, data is easily harvested and the ease
   with which it is used for cross-population analysis, referred to as data
   comparability is enhanced. The current practice, whereby organizations
   under one control maintain their data in independent databases, specific
   to an enterprise application, greatly reduces data comparability and
   makes cross-population analysis a herculean task. In this paper, the
   collocation data model is formulated as consisting of big data
   technologies beyond data mining techniques and used to reduce the
   heterogeneity inherent in databases maintained independently across
   multiple organizations. The collocation data model is thus presented as
   capable of enhancing data comparability across multiple organizations.
   The model was used to cultivate the assessment scores of students in
   some schools for some period and used to rank the schools. The model
   permits data comparability across several geographical scales among
   which are: national, regional and global scales, where harvested data
   form the basis for generating analytics for insights, hindsight, and
   foresight about organizational problems and strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of chemistry apart from the pH of buffers on the
   electrochemical corrosion behaviours of mild steel (MS) and 7004
   aluminium alloy (AA) was studied using acetate, citrate, and
   citrate-phosphate buffers having an identical pH of 4. While the buffers
   showed marginal to insignificant variations in their anodic and cathodic
   kinetics on Pt, the cathodic current density for MS and AA in these
   buffers increased in the order citrate < citrate-phosphate < acetate. As
   for the anodic current density, it increased in the order: acetate <
   citrate < citrate-phosphate for MS and citrate < acetate <
   citrate-phosphate for AA. Such variations were explained based on the
   direct reduction of the weak acids and the complexing behaviour of the
   metal ions with the buffer species. The study suggests the importance of
   considering buffer chemistries while studying the influence of pH on
   electrochemical corrosion including localized corrosion behaviour of
   metals.}},

Abstract = {{As increased oxidative stress causes increased mortality and morbidities
   like bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and retinopathy of prematurity
   (ROP) in very low birth weight infants (VLBWIs), the conundrum of
   improved survival but increased ROP observed with the high oxygen
   saturation target range of 91-95\% is difficult to explain. To determine
   the survival rate-dependent variation in ROP treatment rate, 6292
   surviving eligible VLBWIs registered in the Korean Neonatal Network were
   arbitrarily grouped according to the survival rate of infants at 23-24
   weeks' gestation as group I (>70\%, n=1626), group II (40-70\%, n=2984)
   and group III (<40\%, n=1682). Despite significantly higher survival and
   lower BPD rates in group I than in groups II and III, the ROP treatment
   rate was higher in group I than in groups II and III. However, the
   adjusted odds ratios for ROP treatment were not significantly different
   between the study groups, and the ROP treatment rate in the infants at
   23-24 weeks' gestation was 21-fold higher than the infants at<greater
   than or equal to>27 weeks' gestation. The controversial association
   between improved survival and reduced BPD reflecting quality improvement
   of neonatal intensive care but increased ROP treatment rate might be
   primarily attributed to the improved survival of the most immature
   infants.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCED OPTICAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{While recent studies on nanoscale diffractive lenses demonstrate their
   potential as possible candidates for thin-film display applications,
   their narrow focal ranges limit their application. Graphene, however,
   may realize focal controllability for its unique optoelectric property;
   due to its unique band structure among 2D materials, its carriers can be
   controlled by adjusting the Fermi level. Furthermore, due to the bandgap
   property of graphene, the intraband excitation of carriers is dominant
   over the interband excitation of carriers, which results in enhanced
   photonic transmission and reduced absorbance. Utilizing this property,
   graphene-based ultrathin focusing device is fabricated that alters its
   optical characteristics when direct-current voltage is applied producing
   vertical fringe-specific electric field. The proposed device
   demonstrates 8.6\% change in focal length and 48.85\% focusing
   efficiency at wavelength of 405 nm. Overall, this study on electrically
   tunable ultrathin microlens introduces potential for holographic
   displays and expands the research scope in future display technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Tisagenlecleucel is a CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell
   therapy approved for treatment of pediatric and young adult patients
   with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and adults
   with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The initial experience with
   tisagenlecleucel in a real-world setting from a cellular therapy
   registry is presented here. As of January 2020, 511 patients were
   enrolled from 73 centers, and 410 patients had follow-up data reported
   (ALL, n = 255; NHL, n = 155), with a median follow-up of 13.4 and 11.9
   months for ALL and NHL, respectively. Among patients with ALL, the
   initial complete remission (CR) rate was 85.5\%. Twelve-month duration
   of response (DOR), event-free survival, and overall survival (OS) rates
   were 60.9\%, 52.4\%, and 77.2\%, respectively. Among adults with NHL,
   the best overall response rate was 61.8\%, including an initial CR rate
   of 39.5\%. Six-month DOR, progression-free survival, and OS rates were
   55.3\%, 38.7\%, and 70.7\%, respectively. Grade >= 3 cytokine release
   syndrome and neurotoxicity were reported in 11.6\% and 7.5\% of all
   patients, respectively. Similar outcomes were observed in patients with
   in-specification and out-of-specification products as a result of
   viability <80\% (range, 61\% to 79\%). This first report of
   tisagenlecleucel in the real-world setting demonstrates outcomes with
   similar efficacy and improved safety compared with those seen in the
   pivotal trials.}},

Abstract = {{The potential use of
   bis(methylene)bis(5-bromo-2-hydroxylsalicyloylhydrazone) as a
   multifunctional fluorescence sensor for Cu2+, Ni2+, Co2+ and Fe2+ ions
   was investigated. The optical behaviour shows an increase in an
   absorption band at 408 nm which can be ascribed to the d-d transition
   (UV-vis) of the metal ions and a concomitant decrease in fluorescence
   intensity at 507 nm. The crystallographic analysis shows the binding
   site of the sensor to two Cu2+ ions and confirms the stoichiometry of 1
   : 2 (ligand to metal) which is in good agreement with a Job plot
   analysis. Furthermore the Cu2+-complex catalyses A3 coupling reactions
   at 1 mol\% catalytic loading; chiral propargylamine derivatives were
   obtained in high yield after 24 h reaction time under ambient
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The development of machine learning (ML) approaches in materials science
   offers the opportunity to exploit existing engineering and developmental
   alloy datasets, such as Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)'s
   consistently measured creep-rupture dataset for alumina-forming
   austenitic (AFA) alloys, to accelerate their further development. As a
   first step toward achieving ML insights for improved alloy design, the
   potential sources of uncertainty and their impacts on ML output are
   examined. It is observed that the selection of algorithms and features
   as well as data sampling significantly affects the performance of ML
   models, either positively or negatively. The performance of various ML
   models in predicting the creep properties of AFA alloys is compared,
   with further evaluation by assessment of a small set of new
   developmental AFA alloys that were not part of the training dataset. The
   present study demonstrates that uncertainty quantification (UQ) is
   essential in materials science for evaluating the performance of ML
   algorithms with specifically selected feature sets and obtaining a
   comprehensive understanding of their limitations and the resultant
   capability of effective prediction in complex materials systems.}},

Abstract = {{Manufacturers using additive manufacturing to build parts need to know
   how the complex thermal histories imparted by rapid heating and cooling
   affect the homogeneity of the microstructure and mechanical properties
   within their parts. To identify the possible differences for a part
   built via powder bed fusion, a simulation incorporating superlayers was
   used to predict the thermal history for a part built by a selective
   laser melting process. The simulation captured effects of the increasing
   distance from the substrate as well as the increasing cross-sectional
   area for the conical geometry of the part, which were meant to
   exacerbate thermal history discrepancies between layers. The largest
   thermal gradient difference between layers was 3.7\%, and the largest
   cooling rate difference was about 10\%. Grain size and microhardness
   measurements on the built parts were used to determine whether the
   microstructure and mechanical properties changed as a function of
   distance from the substrate and the increasing cross-sectional area.
   Differences were found to be negligible because the microhardness and
   grain size were uniform throughout the part in the build direction. The
   time (8 s) required to recoat the next layer provided enough cooling
   time to give similar enough thermal histories to fabricate parts with
   consistent grain size and microhardness in the build direction.}},

Abstract = {{Pearl millet hybrids biofortified with iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) promise
   to be part of a long-term strategy to combat micronutrient malnutrition
   in the arid and semi-arid tropical (SAT) regions of the world.
   Biofortification through molecular breeding is the way forward to
   achieving a rapid trait-based breeding strategy. This genome-wide
   association study (GWAS) was conducted to identify significant
   marker-trait associations (MTAs) for Fe, Zn, and protein content (PC)
   for enhanced biofortification breeding. A diverse panel of 281 advanced
   inbred lines was evaluated for Fe, Zn, and PC over two seasons.
   Phenotypic evaluation revealed high variability (Fe: 32-120 mg kg(-1),
   Zn: 19-87 mg kg(-1), PC: 8-16\%), heritability (h(bs)(2)>= 90\%) and
   significantly positive correlation among Fe, Zn and PC (P=0.01),
   implying concurrent improvement. Based on the Diversity Arrays
   Technology (DArT) seq assay, 58,719 highly informative SNPs were
   filtered for association mapping. Population structure analysis showed
   six major genetic groups (K=6). A total of 78 MTAs were identified, of
   which 18 were associated with Fe, 43 with Zn, and 17 with PC. Four SNPs
   viz., Pgl04\_64673688, Pgl05\_135500493, Pgl05\_144482656, and
   Pgl07\_101483782 located on chromosomes Pgl04 (1), Pgl05 (2) and Pgl07
   (1), respectively were co-segregated for Fe and Zn. Promising genes,
   `Late embryogenesis abundant protein', `Myb domain', `pentatricopeptide
   repeat', and `iron ion binding' coded by 8 SNPs were identified. The
   SNPs/genes identified in the present study presents prospects for
   genomics assisted biofortification breeding in pearl millet.}},

Title = {{Morbidity associated with the use of Foley balloon for cervical ripening
   in women with prior cesarean delivery}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERNAL-FETAL \& NEONATAL MEDICINE}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   We evaluated the morbidity of Foley balloon for cervical ripening in
   comparison to oxytocin alone in women with a prior cesarean delivery.
   Study design
   A four-hospital retrospective review of all women with viable singleton
   pregnancies and history of a single prior cesarean delivery presenting
   for cervical ripening between 1994 and 2015. Exposure groups were either
   Foley balloon or oxytocin, at the treating physician's discretion. The
   primary outcome was defined as maternal morbidity, evaluated by a
   composite that included hemorrhage, and/or uterine infection, and/or
   uterine rupture. We defined two secondary outcomes: neonatal morbidity,
   and vaginal delivery rate. Neonatal morbidity was evaluated by a
   composite that included five-minute APGAR score <7 and/or NICU
   admission. We adjusted results for potential confounding variables,
   including hospital site, maternal age and race, initial cervical
   dilation, and gestational age at delivery.
   Results
   We identified 688 patients who received ripening, 276 by Foley balloon
   and 412 by oxytocin. There was no significant difference in the primary
   outcome of maternal morbidity between groups: 38 (13.8\%) in the Foley
   balloon group and 79 (19.2\%) in the oxytocin group (aOR 1.43; 95\% CI,
   0.90-2.27). There was no significant difference in the secondary outcome
   of neonatal morbidity: 31 (11.3\%) in the Foley balloon group and 51
   (12.4\%) in the oxytocin group (aOR 1.02; 95\% CI, 0.57-1.80). The rate
   of vaginal delivery was significantly less in the Foley balloon group
   compared to the oxytocin group: 56.2\% vs 64.1\%, p = .037.
   Conclusion
   When cervical ripening with either Foley balloon or oxytocin was
   utilized at the physician's discretion in women with prior cesarean,
   there was no identified difference in maternal and neonatal morbidity,
   but the rate of successful vaginal delivery was lower.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction between programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand
   PD-L1 activates a coinhibitory signal that blocks T-cell activation,
   promoting the immune escape process in the tumor microenvironment.
   Development of monoclonal antibodies targeting and inhibiting PD-1/PD-L1
   interaction as anticancer immunotherapies has proved successful in
   multiple clinical settings and for various types of cancer.
   Notwithstanding, limitations exist with the use of these biologics,
   including drug resistance and narrow therapeutic response rate in a
   majority of patients, that demand for the design of more efficacious
   small molecule-based immunotherapies. Alteration of pH in the tumor
   microenvironment is a key factor that is involved in promoting drug
   resistance, tumor survival and progression. In this study, we have
   investigated the effect of pH shifts on binding properties of distinct
   classes of PD-L1 inhibitors, including macrocyclic peptide and small
   molecules. Results expand structure-activity relationships of PD-L1
   inhibitors, providing insights into structural features and
   physicochemical properties that are useful for the design of ligands
   that may escape a drug resistance mechanism associated to variable pH
   conditions of tumor microenvironment.}},

Title = {{A novel genetic variant in DNAI2 detected by custom gene panel in a
   newborn with Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia: case report}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL GENETICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{21}},

Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a highly heterogeneous
   genetic disorder caused by defects in motile cilia. The hallmark
   features of PCD are the chronic infections of the respiratory tract,
   moreover, clinical manifestations include also laterality defects and
   risk of male infertility. Clinical phenotypes of PCD are the result of
   mutations in genes encoding components of axonema or factors involved in
   axonemal assembly. Recent studies have identified over 45 PCD-associated
   genes, therefore, molecular analysis represents a powerful diagnostic
   tool to confirm and uncover new genetic causes of this rare disease.
   Case presentation: Here, we describe a female infant of Moroccan origin
   with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) in addition to most common PCD
   symptoms. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and molecular tests,
   such as a Next generation Sequencing panel and a custom array CGH, were
   performed for diagnosis of PCD. TEM revealed outer dynein arm (ODA)
   defects, whilst molecular analyses detected a novel 6,9 kb microdeletion
   in DNAI2 gene.
   Conclusions: Since DNAI2 mutations are very rare, this case report
   contributes to better delineate the important role of DNAI2 as causative
   of PCD phenotype, suggesting, furthermore, that the variations in DNAI2
   may be as a new genetic risk factor for NPH. Indeed, although the
   association of hydrocephalus with PCD has been well documented, however,
   only a small number of human patients show this defect.
   Furthermore, this study highlights the importance of high-throughput
   technologies in advancing our understanding of heterogeneous genetic
   disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Opioids are the most widely used therapy for pain during the
   postoperative period. It has been suggested by some that hydromorphone
   is clinically superior. Our primary objective was to determine if there
   is a difference in postoperative pain score ratings between adult
   patients receiving intravenous hydromorphone vs intravenous morphine on
   discharge from the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Methods For this
   historical cohort study, convenience sampling was used to identify the
   first 605 patients >= 18 yr undergoing elective, non-cardiac surgery.
   Patients were categorized based on treatment in the PACU with
   hydromorphone (n = 326) or morphine (n = 279). Pain scores (scale of
   0-10), nausea/vomiting (scale of 0-3), pruritis (scale of 0-3), and
   sedation (scale of 0-4), as well as total opioid dose administered from
   arrival in the PACU until readiness to discharge were evaluated. Results
   For the primary outcome of pain reported at discharge from the PACU,
   there was no significant difference between the mean (standard
   deviation) hydromorphone numeric rating scale (NRS) {[}2.8 (1.6)] and
   the morphine NRS {[}2.5 (1.5)] after adjusting for potential confounders
   (adjusted mean difference, 0.10; 95\% confidence interval, -0.21 to
   0.42; P = 0.53). Similarly, there were no significant between-group
   differences in length of stay in the PACU, satisfactory analgesia,
   nausea/vomiting, and sedation. Conclusion This study serves to help
   guide the decision-making process for selecting either morphine or
   hydromorphone for acute postoperative analgesia. Overall, we found no
   significant difference for analgesia or for common opioid-related
   adverse effects between these two opioids in the postoperative period at
   the time of discharge from the PACU. Furthermore, according to this
   data, the equipotency ratio of hydromorphone to morphine is closer to
   1:6.5 rather than the commonly employed 1:5 ratio.}},

   prompt that asked them to draw a graph to indicate how rate would change
   over time. Analysis involved characterizing the models students
   constructed, with students combining chemistry principles with
   mathematical reasoning to justify the specific shape of the graph.
   Results indicate similar chemistry and mathematical ideas discussed
   among the students but a variety of distinct models to describe reaction
   rate. The similar chemistry and mathematics ideas used by the students
   indicate they have productive ideas for reasoning about the context, but
   they need more support regarding how to combine these ideas, reflecting
   students' difficulty in using mathematics to model chemistry phenomena.}},

Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Background. This work presents a forecast model for non-typhoidal
   salmonellosis outbreaks.
   Method. This forecast model is based on fitted values of multivariate
   regression time series that consider diagnosis and estimation of
   different parameters, through a very flexible statistical treatment
   called generalized auto-regressive and moving average models (GSARIMA).
   Results. The forecast model was validated by analyzing the cases of
   Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis in Sydney Australia (2014-2016),
   the environmental conditions and the consumption of high-risk food as
   predictive variables.
   Conclusions. The prediction of cases of Salmonella enterica serovar
   Enteritidis infections are included in a forecast model based on fitted
   values of time series modeled by GSARIMA, for an early alert of future
   outbreaks caused by this pathogen, and associated to high-risk food. In
   this context, the decision makers in the epidemiology field can led to

Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{23}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Fungi have been observed to exhibit resistance to high levels of
   ionizing radiation despite sharing most DNA repair mechanisms with other
   eukaryotes. Radioresistance, in fact, is such a common feature in fungi
   that it is difficult to identify species that exhibit widely different
   radiosensitivities, which in turn has hampered the identification of
   genetic elements responsible for this resistance phenotype. Due to the
   inherent mutagenic properties of radiation exposure, however, this can
   be addressed through adaptive laboratory evolution for increased
   ionizing radiation resistance. Here, using the black yeast Exophiala
   dermatitidis, we demonstrate that resistance to gamma-radiation can be
   greatly increased through repeated rounds of irradiation and outgrowth.
   Moreover, we find that the small genome size of fungi situates them as a
   relatively simple functional genomics platform for identification of
   mutations associated with ionizing radiation resistance. This enabled
   the identification of genetic mutations in genes encoding proteins with
   a broad range of functions from 10 evolved strains. Specifically, we
   find that greatly increased resistance to gamma-radiation is achieved in
   E. dermatitidis through disruption of the non-homologous end-joining
   pathway, with three individual evolutionary paths converging to abolish
   this DNA repair process. This result suggests that non-homologous
   end-joining, even in haploid cells where homologous chromosomes are not
   present during much of the cell cycle, is an impediment to repair of
   radiation-induced lesions in this organism, and that the relative levels
   of homologous and non-homologous repair in a given fungal species may
   play a major role in its radiation resistance.}},

Abstract = {{A dual electronic basis set approach is introduced for more efficient
   but accurate calculations of the anharmonic vibrational spectra in the
   framework of the vibrational self-consistent field (VSCF) theory. In
   this approach, an accurate basis set is used to compute the vibrational
   spectra at the harmonic level. The results are used to scale the
   potential surface from a more modest but much more efficient basis set.
   The scaling is such that at the harmonic level the new, scaled potential
   agrees with one of the accurate basis sets. The approach is tested in
   the application of the microsolvated, protected amino acid Ac-Phe-OMe,
   using the scaled anharmonic hybrid potential in the VSCF and VSCF-PT2
   algorithms. The hybrid potential method yields results that are in good
   accord with the experiment and very close to those obtained in
   calculations with the high-level, very costly potential from the large
   basis set. At the same time, the hybrid potential calculations are
   considerably less expensive. The results of the hybrid calculations are
   much more accurate than those computed from the potential surface
   corresponding to the modest basis set. The results are very encouraging
   for using the hybrid potential method for inexpensive yet sufficiently
   accurate anharmonic calculations for the spectra of large biomolecules.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is a widely used diagnostic
   modality in the emergency physician's tool kit. The effect on health
   care costs is disputed. This study examined whether POCUS was associated
   with system-level cost savings. Secondary objectives included adverse
   patient outcomes and the association between POCUS use and diagnostic
   costs in specific patient groups.
   Methods The Point-of-Care Ultrasound Use and Monetary Outcomes study was
   a single-center prospective observational study. A convenience sample of
   emergency medicine physicians working from July to October 2019 were
   included after using POCUS as part of their assessment. The cost of
   patient investigations was compared with those proposed by a control
   group of physicians simultaneously on shift, who were blinded to the
   POCUS findings. Ethical approval was obtained from the Queen's
   University Health Sciences Research Ethics Board.
   Results Fifty patient assessments using POCUS were included. Overall,
   the median investigation cost in United States dollars in the POCUS
   group was \$102.00 (interquartile range {[}IQR], \$39.80-\$167.90)
   versus \$122.40 (IQR, \$70.96-\$175.60) in controls (P = .08). When
   stratified by disposition, POCUS use in patients discharged home
   resulted in a median expenditure of \$71.80 (IQR, \$36.48-\$116.70)
   versus \$122.70 (IQR, \$71.18-\$183.20; P < .001). Significant cost
   savings were also found in flank pain presentations (median, \$138.90;
   IQR, \$136.60-\$186.10; P = .01). There were no differences in the
   quantity of investigations ordered, the patient emergency department
   repeated presentation rate, or safety outcomes at 7 days.
   Conclusions Point-of-care ultrasound use was not associated with
   significant cost savings in our overall population. The subgroup
   analysis revealed significant POCUS-associated cost savings in patients
   discharged home and those presenting with flank pain. Notably, POCUS was
   not associated with an increase in adverse patient safety outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Orbital Battleship, published in 2016 in this Journal, is a hands-on
   competitive exercise which has been shown to be an efficient tool to
   reinforce the knowledge of the atomic structure. We decided to give it a
   more futuristic look and are presenting VR Orbital Battleship, a
   completely immersive collaborative experience which, in contrast to the
   pen-and-paper version, guarantees that students are unable to fill in an
   erroneous electron configuration thanks to the special control elements
   of the game. Hence, they are motivated to do their best in order to
   apply Madelung's rule and Hund's rule right to be able to start the
   game. The game design makes full use of what the immersive virtual
   reality has to offer: the headset completely immerses the player in the
   process of the game, resulting in less distraction compared to the
   classic version. Furthermore, the game's design is user-friendly and
   intuitive, and thus, it adds to the overall immersive experience. The
   game is recommended for use as an interactive addition to school and
   university classes that are dedicated to the atomic structure. VR
   Orbital Battleship is available for free worldwide in both a portable
   mobile platform (Oculus Go) and a PC version by downloading the game
   (see the Supporting Information of this paper).}},

Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{We create a network model to study the spread of an epidemic through
   physically proximate and accidental daily human contacts in a city, and
   simulate outcomes for two kinds of agents-poor and non-poor. Under
   non-intervention, peak caseload is maximised, but no differences are
   observed in infection rates across poor and non-poor. Introducing
   interventions to control spread, peak caseloads are reduced, but both
   cumulative infection rates and current infection rates are
   systematically higher for the poor than for non-poor, across all
   scenarios. Larger populations, higher fractions of poor, and longer
   durations of intervention are found to progressively worsen outcomes for
   the poor; and these are of particular concern for economically
   vulnerable populations in cities of the developing world. Addressing
   these challenges requires a deeper, more rigorous understanding of the
   relationships between structural poverty and epidemy, as well as
   effective utilization of extant community level infrastructure for
   primary care in developing cities. Finally, improving iniquitous
   outcomes for the poor creates better outcomes for the whole population,
   including the non-poor.}},

Volume = {{85}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Expression of fibroblast activation protein (FAP) has been
   detected in activated fibroblasts participating in injury response,
   fibrotic and inflammatory conditions, and tumorigenesis. Human
   endometrium is equally characterized by rapid tissue remodeling events
   due to the reproductive tasks comprising the activity of proteolytic
   enzymes. Objective: We therefore hypothesized that FAP-positive
   fibroblasts could also be involved in physiological processes requiring
   tissue remodeling, such as decidualization during early pregnancy.
   Methods/Results: The expression of FAP was analyzed by
   immunohistochemistry in frozen sections of decidual tissue from early
   pregnancy (gestational weeks: 6-12). All tissue samples clearly
   displayed a strong expression of FAP on the surface of stromal
   fibroblasts. Additionally, the percentage of FAP-positive fibroblasts
   freshly isolated from the decidua of the corresponding gestational weeks
   was calculated by applying FACS analysis. Decidual fibroblasts of
   different gestational weeks showed a significant decrease in FAP
   expression between the 6th and 7th weeks of gestation, which was
   followed by a steady slow reconstitution. By analyzing the expression of
   cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors of isolated FAP-positive
   decidual fibroblasts, we detected high levels of monocyte-attracting
   chemokines (growth-related oncogene alpha and monocyte chemoattractant
   protein-1 and -2), granulocyte-attracting chemokines (e.g., IL-8),
   proinflammatory factors (IL-1 alpha and tumor necrosis factor alpha),
   and angiogenic substances (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor and
   IL-8), which all promote an optimal microenvironment for implantation
   and growth of the conceptus. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that the
   healthy early pregnancy decidua is characterized by a general occurrence
   of FAP-positive fibroblasts possibly participating in active tissue
   remodeling during implantation.}},

Abstract = {{Elderly patients aged 65 or older with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have

   score by eliminating total lymphocyte count from the items to adapt AML
   patients. In this cohort, both the NCCN 2017 risk group and sCONUT score
   successfully stratified the overall survival (OS) of the elderly

Abstract = {{Lung cancer has become one of the major diseases that seriously threaten
   human health. Early diagnosis of lung cancer is very important for the
   quality of lung cancer patients. Researching computer-assisted systems
   for lung cancer recognition is one of the effective means to help
   physicians quickly diagnose lung cancer. Therefore, this paper studies
   the multimodal recognition algorithm for lung images. This algorithm
   uses CT images, PET images, and PET/CT images of lung tumors as the
   experimental objects and uses convolutional neural network to realize
   lung tumor recognition. Based on the recognition of lung tumors by
   convolutional neural networks, an integrated convolutional neural
   network was used to identify lung tumors to improve the recognition
   accuracy and reduce the training time. The experimental results show
   that the convolutional neural network can effectively identify the lung
   tumor images. The number of iterations and batch size in the training
   process will have an impact on the recognition of lung tumors. The
   integrated convolutional neural network designed is superior to single
   convolutional neural network in terms of recognition accuracy and time
   consumption.}},

Title = {{Intensity of resistance training via self-reported history is critical
   in properly characterizing musculoskeletal health}},
Journal = {{BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Intensity of resistance training history might be omitted or
   poorly ascertained in prescreening or data questionnaires involving
   musculoskeletal health. Failure to identify history of high-versus
   low-intensity training may overlook higher effect sizes with higher
   intensities and therefore diminish the precision of statistical analysis
   with resistance training as a covariate and bias the confirmation of
   baseline homogeneity for experimental group designation. The purpose was
   to determine the degree to which a single question assessing participant
   history of resistance training intensity predicted differences in
   musculoskeletal health.
   Methods: In the first research aim, participants were separated into
   groups with a history (RT) and no history (NRT) of resistance training.
   The second research aim evaluated the history of resistance training
   intensity on muscular strength, lean mass, and bone mineral density
   (BMD), RT participants were reassigned into a low- (LIRT) or
   high-intensity resistance training group (HIRT). 83 males and 87 females
   (19.30.6yrs., 171.19.9cm, 67.1 +/- 10.5kg, 22.9 +/- 2.8 BMI, 26.2 +/-
   7.2\% body fat) completed handgrip dynamometry (HG) and dual-energy
   x-ray absorptiometry scans (DXA) for BMD and bone mineral-free lean mass
   (BFLM).
   Results: A 3-group method (NRT, LIRT, HIRT) reduced type-I error
   compared with the 2-group method (NRT, RT) in characterizing the likely
   effects of one's history of resistance training. For the second aim,
   HIRT had significantly (p<0.05) greater HG strength (76.2 +/- 2.2kg) and
   arm BFLM (6.10 +/- 0.16kg) than NRT (67.5 +/- 1.3kg; 4.96 +/- 0.09kg)
   and LIRT (69.7 +/- 2.0kg; 5.42 +/- 0.14kg) while also showing
   significantly lower muscle quality (HG/BFLM) than NRT (13.9 +/- 0.2 vs.
   12.9 +/- 0.3). HIRT had greater BMD at all sites compared to NRT (whole
   body=1.068 +/- 0.008 vs. 1.120 +/- 0.014; AP spine=1.013 +/- 0.011 vs.
   1.059 +/- 0.019; lateral spine=0.785 +/- 0.009 vs. 0.846 +/- 0.016;
   femoral neck=0.915 +/- 0.013 vs. 0.970 +/- 0.022; total hip=1.016 +/-
   0.012 vs. 1.068 +/- 0.021g/cm(2)) while LIRT revealed no significant
   skeletal differences to NRT.
   Conclusions: Retrospective identification of high-intensity history of
   resistance training appears critical in characterizing musculoskeletal
   health and can be ascertained easily in as little as a single,
   standalone question. Both retrospective-questionnaire style
   investigations and pre-screening for potential participation in
   prospective research studies should include participant history of
   resistance training intensity.}},

Abstract = {{Research on effort and motivation commonly assesses how the sympathetic
   branch of the autonomic nervous system affects the cardiovascular
   system. The cardiac pre-ejection period (PEP), assessed via impedance
   cardiography, is a common outcome, but assessing PEP requires
   identifying subtle points on cardiac waveforms. The present research
   examined the psychometric value of the RZ interval (RZ), which has
   recently been proposed as an indicator of sympathetic activity, for
   effort research. Also known as the initial systolic time interval
   (ISTI), RZ is the time (in ms) between the ECG R peak and the dZ/dt Z
   peak. Unlike PEP, RZ involves salient waveform points that are easily
   and reliably identified. Data from two experiments evaluated the
   suitability of RZ for effort paradigms and compared it to a popular
   automated PEP method. In Studies 1 (n = 89) and 2 (n = 71), participants
   completed a standard appetitive task in which each correct response
   earned a small amount of cash. As expected, incentives significantly
   affected PEP and RZ in both experiments. PEP and RZ were highly
   correlated (all rs >= 0.89), and RZ consistently yielded a larger effect
   size than PEP. In Study 3, a quantitative synthesis of the experiments
   indicated that the effect size of RZ's response to incentives (Hedges's
   g = 0.432 {[}0.310, 0.554]) was roughly 15\% larger than PEP's effect
   size (g = 0.376 {[}0.256, 0.496]). RZ thus appears promising for future
   research on sympathetic aspects of effort-related cardiac activity.}},

Abstract = {{According to violation-compensation models of cognitive conflict,
   experiences that violate expected associations evoke a common,
   biologically based syndrome of aversive arousal, which in turn motivates
   compensation efforts to relieve this arousal. However, while substantial
   research shows that people indeed respond with increased arousal to
   expectancy violating events, evidence for the motivating role of arousal
   is rarely found. In two within-subjects studies (N = 44 and N = 50), we
   demonstrate evidence for the motivating role of arousal in this
   violation-compensation process among university students. Using
   pupillometry and the hindsight bias phenomenon, we show that people
   respond with greater arousal when presented with expectancy violating
   information. In turn, we show that the pupillary response is positively
   related to the amount of hindsight bias being displayed. These findings
   provide further insights into the process underlying the hindsight bias
   and, crucially, support key predictions following from
   threat-compensation models.}},

Abstract = {{Background Multicystic dysplastic kidney (MCDK) is a common form of
   congenital cystic kidney disease in children. The etiology of MCDK
   remains unclear. Given an important role of the renin-angiotensin system
   in normal kidney development, we explored whether MCDK in children is
   associated with variants in the genes encoding renin-angiotensin system
   components by Sanger sequencing. Methods The coding regions of renin
   (REN), angiotensinogen (AGT), ACE, and angiotensin 1 receptor (AGTR1)
   genes were amplified by PCR. The effect of DNA sequence variants on
   protein function was predicted with PolyPhen-2 software. Results 3 novel
   and known AGT variants were found. 1 variant was probably damaging, 1
   was possibly damaging and one was benign. Out of 7 REN variants, 4 were
   probably damaging and 3 were benign. Of 6 ACE variants, 3 were probably
   damaging and 3-benign. 3 AGTR1 variants were found. 2 variants were
   possibly damaging, and one was benign. Conclusion We report novel
   associations of sequence variants in REN, AGT, ACE, or AGTR1 genes in
   children with isolated MCDK in the United States. Our findings suggest a
   recessive disease model and support the hypothesis of multiple
   renin-angiotensin system gene involvement in MCDK. Impact

   The samples were characterised using direct-infusion
   negative-nano-electrospray-ionisation ultrahigh-resolution mass
   spectrometry to elucidate the composition and the potential primary and
   secondary sources of the organic fraction. The samples from the two
   seasons were compared with those from a road-tunnel site and an urban
   background site in Birmingham, UK, analysed in the course of an earlier
   study using the same method. There were strong differences in aerosol
   particle composition between the seasons, particularly regarding
   (poly-)aromatic compounds, which were strongly enhanced in winter,
   likely due to increased fossil fuel and biomass burning for heating. In
   addition to the seasonal differences, compositional differences between
   high- and low-pollution conditions were observed, with the contribution
   of sulfur-containing organic compounds strongly enhanced under
   high-pollution conditions. There was a correlation of the number of
   sulfur- containing molecular formulae with the concentration of
   particulate sulfate, consistent with a particle-phase formation process.}},

Title = {{Life cycle assessment of lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide (NCM)
   batteries for electric passenger vehicles}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{273}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{This study evaluated and quantified the life cycle environmental impacts
   of lithium-ion power batteries (LIBs) for passenger electric vehicles to
   identify key stages that contribute to the overall environmental burden
   and to find ways to reduce this burden effectively. Primary data for the
   assessment were collected onsite from the two Chinese leading LIB
   suppliers, two leading cathode material producers and two battery
   recycling corporations from 2017 to 2019. Six environmental impact
   categories, including primary energy demand (PED), global warming
   potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP), photochemical oxidant
   creation potential (POCP), eutrophication potential (EP) and human
   toxicity potential (HTP), were considered in accordance with the ISO
   14040/14044 standards.
   The results indicate that material preparation stage is the largest
   contributor to the LIB's life cycle PED, GWP, AP, POCP, EP and HTP, with
   the cathode active material, wrought aluminum and electrolytes as the
   predominant contributors. In the production stage, vacuum drying and
   coating and drying are the two main processes for all the six impact
   categories. In the end-of-life stage, waste LIBs recycling could largely
   reduce the life cycle POCP and HTP.
   Sensitivity analysis results depict that replacing NCM 622 by NCM 811 as
   the cathode active material could increase all the six environmental
   impacts. We hope this study is helpful to reduce the uncertainties
   associated with the life cycle assessment of LIBs in existing
   literatures and to identify opportunities to improve the environmental
   performance of LIBs within the whole life cycle. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

   disorders amongst Yazidi female survivors of ISIS slavery and violence}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Background In 2014 the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) undertook
   a systematic and deliberate campaign against minority groups and
   non-Sunni Muslim communities. Amongst some of the greatest atrocities
   were those targeted towards Yazidi communities and in particular their
   women. The mental health outcomes of those women held in captivity
   requires investigation. This study sought to examine and compare levels
   of general psychological distress, depression, generalized anxiety,
   posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and self-reported suicidal thoughts
   and behaviors amongst Yazidi women held in captivity compared with those
   without such experiences. Method Between January to May 2019, a total
   348 Yazidi women located in internal displaced person (IDP) camps were
   interviewed. Of these 348, 139 females were survivors of ISIS captivity.
   Measures used included Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10),
   Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder
   (GAD-7), and Harvard Trauma Questionnaire part IV (HTQ part IV). Results
   Formerly enslaved Yazidi females showed a significantly higher
   prevalence of severe mental distress (97.1\%; P < 0.001), more severe
   levels of depression (36.7\%; P < 0.001) and general anxiety symptoms
   (37.4\%; P < 0.001), greater rates of PTSD (90.6\%; P < 0.001) and
   higher reported rates of suicidal ideation (38.1\%; P < 0.001). Logistic
   regression analysis undertaken to examine the role of sociodemographic
   factors as predictors of the assessed mental health conditions. Amongst
   the formerly enslaved group, no such significance was found, however
   amongst the non-enslaved group, unemployment was found to statistically
   determine depression, generalized anxiety and PTSD. Specifically, women
   from the non-enslaved group who were unemployed were 2.5 times more
   likely to have depression, 3 times more likely to have generalized
   anxiety and 3.3 times more likely to have PTSD. Finally, amongst the
   non-enslaved group, those women with between 5 to 8 siblings were
   significantly less likely to have depression than those with fewer
   siblings. Conclusion Rates of distress and trauma related symptomology
   were significantly higher amongst those with history of enslavement.
   Sociodemographic factors and duration of enslavement do not seem to
   predict mental disorders among enslaved females.}},

Volume = {{77}},

Abstract = {{The performance of differential evolution (DE) algorithm highly depends
   on the selection of mutation strategy. However, there are six commonly
   used mutation strategies in DE. Therefore, it is a challenging task to
   choose an appropriate mutation strategy for a specific optimization
   problem. For a better tackle this problem, in this paper, a novel DE
   algorithm based on local fitness landscape called LFLDE is proposed, in
   which the local fitness landscape information of the problem is
   investigated to guide the selection of the mutation strategy for each
   given problem at each generation. In addition, a novel control parameter
   adaptive mechanism is used to improve the proposed algorithm. In the
   experiments, a total of 29 test functions originated from CEC2017
   single-objective test function suite which are utilized to evaluate the
   performance of the proposed algorithm. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test and
   Friedman rank test results reveal that the performance of the proposed
   algorithm is better than the other five representative DE algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Coal is one of the major fuels for power generation, and it will
   continue in this capacity for the next several decades. Two types of
   coal are mainly used: lignite and bituminous coals. When exposed to air,
   post-mining, the coal surface undergoes LTO (low-temperature oxidation)
   at RT-150 degrees C according to the atmospheric oxygen level. The LTO
   process decreases the calorific value of the coal, and consequently,
   different gases are released {[}mainly carbon oxides (CO, CO2), water
   vapor, hydrogen (H-2), and also some low molecular-weight organic gases
   (C1-5)]. Some of these gases are toxic and flammable. In extreme cases,
   fires erupt. The mechanism by which the molecular oxygen oxidizes the
   coal macromolecule at the temperature range of 30-150 degrees C (LTO
   process) is complex and also involves a chain of radical reactions that
   take place; however, the exact underlying mechanism is not yet clear.
   The LTO process was studied in detail by simulating the processes
   occurring in the coal piles by using two coal types: an American Bailey
   coal, used in Israeli coal-fired utilities and a German Hambach lignite,
   used in German utilities. The mechanism underlying the LTO process and
   the radical reactions that are involved are discussed in detail.}},

Abstract = {{The spin-resolved transport for monolayer MoS2 through a zigzag
   nanoribbon superlattice based on the transfer matrix method in the
   resonant tunneling regime is investigated in the presence of an external
   perpendicular electric field. The controllable external electric field
   leads to the so-called Rashba effect, which can modulate the internal
   spin-orbit coupling. Our investigations show that by controlling the
   Rashba strength, it is possible to attain 100\% spin-polarization and
   spin-flip, which can be used in designing an optimized spintronic
   device. In addition, the effects of superlattice specific parameters
   (D/W), the barrier height (V-0), and the number of barriers (N) on the
   functionality of the system are studied, leading to optimum results for
   the case of 20 barriers.}},

Title = {{Assessing the environmental sustainability of an emerging energy
   technology: Solar thermal calcination for cement production}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{742}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Cement production is a highly energy-intensive process, contributing 7\%
   to global CO2 emissions. Over 80\% of the energy used in cement
   production is consumed by the calcination process. This paper considers
   a novel solar thermal technology for calcination, to investigate if it
   could help mitigate the climate change and other environmental impacts
   from cement production on a life cycle basis. The following three solar
   options are compared to conventional fossil-fuel calcination via life
   cycle assessment: a full solar system, which provides all the required
   thermal energy, and two hybrid systems, where the solar system provides
   14\% and 33\% of the thermal energy, respectively. The results show that
   all three solar options have lower impacts than conventional calcination
   in 14 out of 17 categories. The full solar system is the best
   alternative, with major reductions in climate change (48\%), fossil
   depletion (75\%), photochemical ozone formation (92\%) and terrestrial
   ecotoxicity (79\%). Based on insolation levels in different parts of
   theworld, the solar systems could be applied to 26\% of current global
   cement production. This would reduce the climate change impact by
   15-40\%, as well as most other impacts by 14-87\%, depending on the fuel
   mix. However, a limiting factor might be two times greater land
   occupation than by the conventional process. Furthermore, the solar
   system has higher human toxicity-cancer (102\%) and metals and minerals
   depletion (6\%) due to the construction of solar facilities. Coupling
   conventional calcination with carbon capture and storage (CCS) is more
   efficient in reducing the climate change impact (63\%) than the solar
   system (48\%) relative to conventional calcination without CCS. However,
   adding CCS to the solar calciner would still be a better option,
   decreasing the impact by 81\% relative to conventional calcination
   without CCS. These findings will be of interest to the solar and cement
   industries as well as other industrial sectors using high-temperature
   processes. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Rhabdomyolysis has been reported in patients who abuse synthetic
   cannabinoids. However, no studies have yet assessed whether these cases
   reflect the direct cytotoxicity of synthetic cannabinoids on skeletal
   muscle, a possibility that the present study sought to address.
   Specifically, this study investigated the cytotoxicity of the synthetic
   cannabinoid CP-55,940, a compound that acts equally on both types of
   cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2), in a human embryonic
   rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cell line. Exposure of these cells to CP-55,940
   resulted in concentration-dependent decreases in cell viability. These
   effects were attenuated by pre-incubation with AM251 (30 mu M), a
   selective CB1 receptor antagonist, but not by pre-incubation with AM630
   (30 mu M), a selective CB2 receptor antagonist. Following treatment with
   CP-55,940, RD cells exhibited apoptosis, as indicated by the
   accumulation of annexin-V, activation of caspase-3, and a loss of the
   mitochondrial membrane potential. Additionally, CP-55,940 treatment of
   RD cells led to increases in intracellular Ca2+ levels.
   CP-55,940-induced cell death was significantly attenuated in the absence
   of extracellular Ca2+, and was partially decreased by pre-incubation
   with verapamil (5 mu M) or diltiazem (5 mu M), compounds that block the
   l-type Ca2+ channel. Our results indicate that the cytotoxicity of
   CP-55,940 towards RD cells (skeletal muscle cells) is mediated by the
   CB1 receptor, but not by the CB2 receptor. Our results further suggest
   that calcium influx through the l-type channel may play an important
   role in the apoptosis induced by these compounds.}},

Title = {{Stagnant forearc mantle wedge inferred from mapping of shear-wave
   anisotropy using S-net seafloor seismometers}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Shear-wave anisotropy in Earth's mantle helps constrain the
   lattice-preferred orientation of anisotropic minerals due to viscous
   flow. Previous studies at the Japan Trench subduction zone using
   land-based seismic networks identified strong anisotropy in the mantle
   wedge, reflecting viscous flow induced by the subducting slab. Here we
   map anisotropy in the previously uninvestigated offshore region by
   analyzing shear waves from interplate earthquakes that are recorded by a
   new seafloor network (the S-net). The newly detected anisotropy is not
   in the mantle wedge but only in the overlying crust (similar to 0.1s
   time delay and trench-parallel fast direction). The distinct lack of
   anisotropy indicates that the forearc mantle wedge offshore is decoupled
   from the slab and does not participate in the viscous flow, in sharp
   contrast with the rest of the mantle wedge. A stagnant forearc mantle
   wedge provides a stable and cold tectonic environment that is important
   for the petrological evolution and earthquake processes of subduction
   zones. Knowledge of shear-wave anisotropy is important to understanding
   the structure and dynamics of the subduction zone mantle wedge. Here,
   the authors find unambiguous evidence that forearc anisotropy resides in
   the upper-plate crust, while weak anisotropy in the most seaward part of
   the mantle wedge indicates decoupling from the slab}},

Abstract = {{The immense growth of the cloud infrastructure leads to the deployment
   of several machine learning as a service (MLaaS) in which the training

   within the smart farming technologies as they are acquiring more
   attention towards the global food supply needs with their intensifying
   demands. Smart farming is known to be a combination of data-driven

Abstract = {{Introduction: Clinical benefits of laparoscopic surgery are well
   established, but evidence for financial benefits is limited. This study
   aimed to compare the financial impact of the introduction of
   laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Methods: This study included patients
   who underwent colorectal surgery between January 2010 and 2015. We
   collected a range of financial data and divided the patients into 2
   groups. Primary outcome was total cost defined by surgical-related
   costs. Results: A total of 1,246 patients were included, of which 440
   surgeries were performed laparoscopically. The total median cost of
   laparoscopy was higher compared to open surgery (EUR 4,665 vs. EUR
   4,268, p = 0.001). Laparoscopy was associated with higher equipment
   costs (EUR 857 vs. EUR 232, p < 0.001), longer operating time (3.2 vs.
   2.5 hours, p < 0.001), and more readmissions (10.9 vs. 8.5\%, p <
   0.001). However, after adjusting for heterogeneity, no difference was
   found in total cost. Surgical-related costs were counterbalanced by
   lower costs associated with shorter median hospital stay (6 vs. 9 days,
   p < 0.001), less morbidity (37.3 vs. 55.1\%, p < 0.001), and less
   mortality (1.8 vs. 5.6\%, p = 0.013) for laparoscopy. Conclusion: During
   the introduction of laparoscopy for colorectal surgery, no significant
   differences were found in total cost between laparoscopic and open
   colorectal surgery. However, favorable postoperative outcomes were
   achieved with laparoscopic surgery.}},

Abstract = {{This work demonstrates the presence of immune regulatory cells in the
   cervical lymph nodes draining Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccinated
   site on the dorsum of the ear in guinea pigs. It is shown that whole
   cervical lymph node cells did not proliferate in vitro in the presence
   of soluble mycobacterial antigens (PPD or leprosin) despite being
   responsive to whole mycobacteria. Besides, T cells from these lymph
   nodes separated as a non-adherent fraction on a nylon wool column,
   proliferated to PPD in the presence of autologous antigen presenting
   cells. Interestingly, addition of as low as 20\% nylon wool adherent
   cells to these, sharply decreased the proliferation by 83\%. Looking
   into what cells in the adherent fraction suppressed the proliferation,
   it was found that neither the T cell nor the macrophage enriched cell
   fractions of this population individually showed suppressive effect,
   indicating that their co-presence was necessary for the suppression.
   Since BCG induced granulomas resolve much faster than granulomas induced
   by other mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium leprae the present
   experimental findings add to the existing evidence that intradermal BCG
   vaccination influences subsequent immune responses in the host and may
   further stress upon its beneficial role seen in Covid-19 patients. (C)

Abstract = {{Introduction and hypothesis The objective was to review the long-term
   prevalence of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) after laparoscopic
   hysterectomy (LH) compared with vaginal hysterectomy (VH). Methods An
   observational cohort study was conducted amongst women who underwent an
   LH or a VH for benign indications during the period 1996-2004: the
   POP-UP study. The prevalence of POP was inventoried by a questionnaire
   involving the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI-20) and a pelvic
   floor examination (POP-Q). Women were divided into groups based on route
   and indication of hysterectomy: LH, VH-1 (for nonprolapse), and VH-2
   (prolapse). Results Four hundred and six of the 706 eligible patients
   (58\%) returned the questionnaire and 247 underwent POP-Q examination.
   Sixty-eight patients (17\%) received treatment for prolapse; 8\% LH,
   10\% VH-1, and 29\% VH-2 (Chi-squared test, p < 0.001). The prevalence
   of vaginal vault prolapse (apical surgery or >= stage 2 at POP-Q) was
   4.4\% for LH and 5.8\% for VH-1 (p = 0.707); and 23\% for VH-2 (VH-2
   versus others, p < 0.0001). The prevalence of prolapse >= stage 2 in any
   compartment was 62\% (n = 153) in total and in 42\% of the LH group,
   51\% of the VH-1 group, and 84\% of the VH-2 group (Chi-squared test, p
   < 0.001). A symptomatic POP (anatomical POP >= stage 2 with bulging) was
   present in 11\% of the population. Conclusions No difference was found
   in the prevalence of POP between LH and VH for nonprolapse indications.
   However, POP after VH for prolapse occurs more frequently than after
   hysterectomy for other indications.}},

Abstract = {{Green's function methods within many-body perturbation theory provide a
   general framework for treating electronic correlations in excited states
   and spectra. Here, we develop the cumulant form of the one-electron
   Green's function using a real-time coupled-cluster equation-of-motion
   approach, in an extension of our previous study (Rehr J.; et al. J.
   Chem. Phys. 2020, 152, 174113). The approach yields a nonperturbative
   expression for the cumulant in terms of the solution to a set of coupled
   first-order, nonlinear differential equations. The method thereby adds
   nonlinear corrections to traditional cumulant methods, which are linear
   in the self-energy. The approach is applied to the core-hole Green's
   function and is illustrated for a number of small molecular systems. For
   these systems, we find that the nonlinear contributions yield
   significant improvements, both for quasiparticle properties such as
   core-level binding energies and for inelastic losses that correspond to
   satellites observed in photoemission spectra.}},

Title = {{Examining the dimensions and mechanisms of tourists' environmental
   behavior: A theory of planned behavior approach}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{273}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Human behavior has varying effects on the environment because of its way
   and intensity. The majority of the current studies on tourists'
   environmental behavior primarily considers the environmentally
   conservative behavior and the environmentally disturbing behavior, while
   the environmentally radical behavior (very strong sense of
   responsibility) has not been well-documented in the literature. This
   study aims to examine the dimensions of tourists' environmental behavior
   and the mechanism of different types of tourists' environmental
   behavior. Study results identify three dimensions of tourists'
   environmental behavior, including: 1) environmentally radical behavior,
   2) environmentally conservative behavior, and 3) environmentally
   disturbing behavior. This paper uses the theory of planned behavior to
   develop three different interpretation models of tourists' environmental
   behavior, and test hypothesized relationships in the interpretation
   models by structural equation models. The results show that the
   hypothesized relationships between attitude, subjective norms, perceived
   behavioral control, environmental behavioral intention and environmental
   behavior in the tourists' environmentally conservative behavior and
   environmentally disturbing behavior interpretation model were all
   supported. However, the hypothesis that subjective norms positively
   affect the environmental behavioral intention was not supported in the
   model of tourists' environmentally radical behavior. Study results
   provide suggestions and guidance for tourism management agencies to
   implement scientific and effective tourism environmental protection
   measures and policies. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon monoxide (CO) is a known endogenous signaling molecule with
   potential therapeutic indications in treating inflammation, cancer,
   neuroprotection, and sickle cell disease among many others. One of the
   hurdles in using CO as a therapeutic agent is the development of
   pharmaceutically acceptable delivery forms for various indications.
   Along this line, we have developed organic CO prodrugs that allow for
   packing this gaseous molecule into a dosage form for the goal of
   ``carbon monoxide in a pill.{''} This should enable non-inhalation
   administration including oral and intravenous routes. These prodrugs
   have previously demonstrated efficacy in multiple animal models. To
   further understand the CO delivery efficiency of these prodrugs in
   relation to their efficacy, we undertook the first pharmacokinetic
   studies on these prodrugs. In doing so, we selected five representative
   prodrugs with different CO release kinetics and examined their
   pharmacokinetics after administration via oral, intraperitoneal, and
   intravenous routes. It was found that all three routes were able to
   elevate systemic CO level with delivery efficiency in the order of
   intravenous, oral, and intraperitoneal routes. CO prodrugs and their
   CO-released products were readily cleared from the circulation. CO
   prodrugs demonstrate promising pharmaceutical properties in terms of
   oral CO delivery and minimal drug accumulation in the body. This
   represents the very first study of the interplay among CO release
   kinetics, CO prodrug clearance, route of administration, and CO delivery
   efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrogen is important for the enrichment of grain Zn when Zn is foliarly
   applied. However, decreasing soil N input has become a major issue for
   environmental protection. A 2-yr field experiment was conducted to
   evaluate the effectiveness of spraying different Zn sources {[}ZnSO4 or
   Zn(Gly)(2)] combined with or without urea on grain Zn concentration and
   bioavailability under reduced soil N rates, both in single wheat
   plantation and winter wheat-summer maize rotation. Results showed that
   foliar application of Zn(Gly)(2) significantly increased grain Zn
   concentration by 88\% under wheat-summer maize rotation and 150\% under
   single wheat plantation. The effectiveness of foliar ZnSO4 application
   in increasing grain Zn was similar with that of Zn(Gly)(2). Adding urea
   to foliar ZnSO4 or Zn(Gly)(2) further increased grain Zn concentration
   under reduced soil N rates. Grain Zn biavailability increased with the
   reduction of soil N rates, but decreased after application of foliar Zn
   fertilizers. Foliar fertilization significantly increased protein, Fe,
   and Mn concentrations in grain, and the magnitudes of these increases
   were greater when Zn(Gly) (2) alone or ZnSO (4) plus urea were applied.
   Simultaneous foliar application of ZnSO4 and urea slightly increased
   farmer's net income. These results suggest that foliar application of
   ZnSO (4) plus urea can be used as efficient and economical fertilization
   strategies to increase Zn concentration and bioavailability in wheat
   grain under reduced soil N supply, and consequently minimize Zn
   deficiency in humans.}},

Abstract = {{Negative emotion differentiation facilitates emotion regulation.
   However, whether individual differences in negative emotion
   differentiation is associated with resting-state spontaneous emotion
   regulation remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the effect of
   individual differences in negative emotion differentiation on
   spontaneous emotional regulatory processes as indexed by resting
   electroencephalogram (EEG) indicators (e.g., frontal alpha asymmetry and
   theta/beta ratio). Participants (n = 40, M-age = 21.74 years, 62\%
   women) completed a negative emotion differentiation task. Afterward, 4
   min of resting EEG data were recorded. Multiple regression results
   showed that negative emotion differentiation significantly predicted the
   alpha asymmetry at electrode pairs (F4-F3 and FP2-FP1) and the
   theta/beta ratio at the F3 and FZ electrode sites. Individuals with high
   negative emotion differentiation presented more left-lateralized
   activations and a lower theta/beta ratio. Taken together, these results
   suggest that individuals with high negative emotion differentiation show
   enhanced spontaneous emotional regulatory functioning. Thus, we provided
   the first resting-state neural evidence on emotion differentiation of
   spontaneous emotional regulatory functioning.}},

Abstract = {{We apply a machine learning (ML) technique to the multiobjective design
   of polymer blend electrolytes. In particular, we are interested in
   maximizing electrolyte performance measured by a combination of ionic
   transport (measured by ionic conductivity) and electrolyte mechanical
   properties (measured by viscosity) in a coarse-grained molecular
   dynamics framework. Recognizing the expense of evaluating each of these
   properties, we identify that the anionic mean-squared displacement and
   polymer relaxation time can serve as their proxies. By employing the ML
   approach known as Bayesian optimization, we identify a trade-off between
   ion transport and electrolyte mechanical properties as a function of
   varied design parameters, which include host molecular weight and
   polarity. Our results suggest that blend electrolytes whose hosts have
   unequal molecular weights, such as gel polymer electrolytes, rarely
   maximize electrolyte performance. Overall, our results suggest the
   potential of a framework to design high-performance electrolytes using a
   combination of molecular simulation and ML.}},

Abstract = {{The phenomenon of anthropogenic climate change has been identified as a
   threat multiplier for many human-related concerns. Carbon capture and
   storage (CCS) can, in combination with several other mitigation
   technologies, alleviate global warming by reducing carbon dioxide (CO2)
   emissions. Reducing climate change-related risks via CCS creates another
   risk, smaller in extent: the risk that some of the stored CO2 leaks out
   of the storage complex. This article reviews European legislation and
   evaluates how one of its objectives, that private liabilities of
   CCS-related leakage risks are not socialized, is ensured. Slight
   modifications of European legislation are suggested in order to prevent
   an indefinite liability of CCS operators in case a storage complex turns
   out to be unexpectedly and unavoidably prone to CO2 leakages. Official
   German and Hungarian financial precaution specifications are contrasted
   and related to this article's finding that the state budget is
   sufficiently hedged against the expected value of climate-related
   leakage compensation costs of poorly managed storage complexes if 3 to
   6\% of a CCS operator's emission-related revenues are diverted into a
   financial precaution fund.}},

Abstract = {{Background Radioresistance is a major challenge in the use of
   radiotherapy for the treatment of lung cancer while microRNAs (miRs)
   have been reported to participate in multiple essential cellular
   processes including radiosensitization. This study was conducted with
   the main objective of investigating the potential role of miR-320a in
   radioresistance of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) via the possible
   mechanism related to HIF1 alpha, KDM5B, and PTEN. Methods Firstly, NSCLC
   radiosensitivity-related microarray dataset GSE112374 was obtained.
   Then, the expression of miR-320a, HIF1 alpha, KDM5B, and PTEN was
   detected in the collected clinical NSCLC samples, followed by Pearson's
   correlation analysis. Subsequently, ChIP assay was conducted to
   determine the content of the PTEN promoter fragment enriched by the IgG
   antibody and H3K4me3 antibody. Finally, a series of in vitro and in vivo
   assays were performed in order to evaluate the effects of miR-320a on
   radioresistance of NSCLC with the involvement of HIF1 alpha, KDM5B, and
   PTEN. Results The microarray dataset GSE112374 presented with a high
   expression of miR-320a in NSCLC radiosensitivity samples, which was
   further confirmed in our clinical samples with the use of reverse
   transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Moreover, miR-320a
   negatively targeted HIF1 alpha, inhibiting radioresistance of NSCLC.
   Interestingly, miR-320a suppressed the expression of KDM5B, and KDM5B
   was found to enhance the radioresistance of NSCLC through the
   downregulation of PTEN expression. The inhibition of miR-320a in
   radioresistance of NSCLC was also reproduced by in vivo assay.
   Conclusion Taken together, our findings were suggestive of the
   inhibitory effect of miR-320a on radioresistance of NSCLC through HIF1
   alpha-suppression mediated methylation of PTEN.}},

Title = {{A healthy lifestyle mitigates the risk of heart disease related to type
   2 diabetes: a prospective nested case-control study in a nationwide

Abstract = {{Aims/hypothesis We aimed to examine the association between type 2
   diabetes and major subtypes of heart disease, to assess the role of
   genetic and early-life familial environmental factors in this
   association and to explore whether and to what extent a healthy
   lifestyle mitigates the risk of heart disease related to type 2
   diabetes.
   Methods In this prospective nested case-control study based on the
   Swedish Twin Registry, 41,463 twin individuals who were aged >= 40 and
   heart disease-free were followed up for 16 years (from 1998 to 2014) to
   detect incident heart disease. Type 2 diabetes was ascertained from
   self-report, the National Patient Registry and glucose-lowering
   medication use. Heart disease diagnosis (including coronary heart
   disease, cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure) and onset age were
   identified from the National Patient Registry. Healthy lifestyle-related
   factors consisted of being a non-smoker, no/mild alcohol consumption,
   regular physical activity and being non-overweight. Participants were
   divided into three groups according to the number of lifestyle-related
   factors: (1) unfavourable (participants who had no or only one healthy
   lifestyle factor); (2) intermediate (any two or three); and (3)
   favourable (four). Generalised estimating equation models for unmatched
   case-control design and conditional logistic regression for co-twin
   control design were used in data analyses.
   Results Of all participants, 2304 (5.5\%) had type 2 diabetes at
   baseline. During the observation period, 9262 (22.3\%) had any incident
   heart disease. In unmatched case-control analyses and co-twin control
   analyses, the multi-adjusted OR and 95\% CI of heart disease related to
   type 2 diabetes was 4.36 (3.95, 4.81) and 4.89 (3.88, 6.16),
   respectively. The difference in ORs from unmatched case-control analyses
   vs co-twin control analyses was statistically significant (OR 1.57; 95\%
   CI 1.42, 1.73; p < 0.001). In stratified analyses by type 2 diabetes,
   compared with an unfavourable lifestyle, an intermediate lifestyle or a
   favourable lifestyle was associated with a significant 32\% (OR 0.68;
   95\% CI 0.49, 0.93) or 56\% (OR 0.44; 95\% CI 0.30, 0.63) decrease in
   heart disease risk among patients with type 2 diabetes, respectively.
   There were significant additive and multiplicative interactions between
   lifestyle and type 2 diabetes on heart disease.
   Conclusions/interpretation Type 2 diabetes is associated with more than
   fourfold increased risk of heart disease. The association still remains
   statistically significant, even after fully controlling for genetic and
   early-life familial environmental factors. However, greater adherence to
   a healthy lifestyle may significantly mitigate the risk of heart disease
   related to type 2 diabetes.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known on the association between clinical factors and
   coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) more than 15 days after diagnosis.
   We conducted a multicentric prospective cohort of COVID-19 hospitalized
   patients to describe clinical, biological, and virological
   characteristics at hospital admission and over time, according to
   mortality up to Day 60 after admission. For the analysis of risk factors
   of survival, analyses assessing associations between mortality and
   demographic characteristics or comorbidities were performed using a Cox
   regression model. Between January 24 and March 15, 2020, 246 patients
   with reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reactions virologically
   confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled. In multivariate analysis, mortality at
   Day 60 (n = 42 patients, 17.1\% {[}95\% confidence interval, 12.6-22.4])
   was associated with older age (adjusted hazard ratio {[}aHR] for age >=
   65 years: 5.22 {[}2.56-10.63, p < .001]), gender (aHR for male: 2.97
   {[}1.47-5.99, p = .002]), chronic pulmonary disease (aHR: 4.84

   and diabetes (aHR: 1.98 {[}1.01-3.89, p = .048]). The median
   nasopharyngeal viral load at admission was 6.4 log(10) copies/ml and was
   associated with mortality regardless of clinical risk factors. Viral
   load decreased with time elapsed since symptoms onset. Our study
   confirmed that mortality was associated with clinical characteristics at
   admission. The viral load at admission was significantly lower in
   patients admitted late after the onset of symptoms in both dead and
   alive patients. Our results could improve earlier identification of
   patients with increased risk of mortality and adapted management.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose This study aims to clarify the risk management practices of
   banks as supply chain finance (SCF) service providers.
   Design/methodology/approach Using 4,014 evaluation and approval reports,
   this study constructed five risk management factors and examined their
   functions with secondary data. Two text-mining techniques (i.e. word
   sense induction, TF-IDF) were used to equip the classic routine of
   dictionary-based content analysis. Findings This research successfully
   identified four important risk management factors: relationship-based
   assessment, asset monitoring, cash flow monitoring and supply chain
   collaboration. The default-preventing effect of these factors are
   different and contingent on the type of financing contexts (i.e.
   preshipment, postshipment). Practical implications The empirical
   evidences provide practical implications for SCF service providers to
   manage risk. SCF service providers are suggested to pay more attention
   to cash flow monitoring when providing postshipment financing services
   and shift the focus to relationship building and supply chain
   collaboration when providing preshipment financing services.
   Originality/value The study shows that a large volume of textual
   materials can provide adequate clues for researches as long as they are
   mined with suitable analytic techniques and approaches. Based on the
   results, SCF service providers can identify problems of their operations
   and directions for improvement. In addition, the risk management
   vocabulary from the E\&A reports can be utilized by SCF service
   providers to digitize their loan approving process and, further, to
   facilitate the decision-makings.}},

Abstract = {{Steatosis is the accumulation of triglycerides in hepatic cells wherein
   fats exceed 5\% of the entire liver weight. Although steatotic liver
   damage is reversible due to the liver's regenerative capability,
   protracted damage often and typically leads to irreversible conditions
   such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Therefore, early
   steatotic detection is critical for preventing progression to advanced
   liver diseases. This also becomes particularly important given the
   higher prevalence of drug usage, as drugs are a frequent cause of liver
   damage. Currently, the recommendation to diagnose steatosis is using
   liver enzymes and performing a liver biopsy. Liver biopsy remains the
   gold standard method of detection, but the procedure is invasive and an
   unreliable diagnostic tool. Non-invasive, specific and sensitive
   diagnostic solutions such as biomarkers are therefore needed for the
   early detection of steatosis. Our aim is to identify changes in urinary
   metabolites in tetracycline-induced hepatic steatotic rats at different
   stages of the diseases using metabolomic-based techniques. Sprague
   Dawley male rats are treated by intraperitoneal injection (I.P.) with
   either 62.5 mg kg(-1) or 125 mg kg(-1) tetracycline, an antibiotic
   previously known to induce steatosis. We analyse the metabolic profile
   of the urinary tetracycline induced hepatic steatotic rats using H-1
   nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), 2D H-1-H-1 TOCSY (total correlation
   spectroscopy) and electrospray liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
   (ESI-LC-MS/MS) based metabolomics. The combined analysis of haematoxylin
   \& eosin (H\&E), oil red O (ORO) and direct measurement of triglyceride
   content in the liver tissues of the control samples against 125 mg
   kg(-1) and 62.5 mg kg(-1) treated samples, reveals that 125 mg kg(-1)
   tetracycline exposure potentially induces steatosis. The combination of
   H-1 NMR, 2D H-1-H-1 TOCSY and ESI-LC-MS/MS alongside multivariate
   statistical analysis, detected a total of 6 urinary metabolites changes,
   across 6 metabolic pathways. Furthermore, lysine concentration
   correlates with liver damage as tetracycline dose concentration
   increases, whilst both H\&E and ORO fail to detect hepatocellular damage
   at the lowest dose concentration. We conclude that the combination of
   H-1 NMR and ESI-LC-MS/MS suggests that these are suitable platforms for
   studying the pathogenesis of steatosis development, prior to
   morphological alterations observed in staining techniques and offer a
   more detailed description of the severity of the steatotic disease.}},

Title = {{Green paradox: Factors affecting travel distances and fuel usages,
   evidence from Japanese survey}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{273}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Reducing vehicle travel distances may eventually be a promising option
   for reducing oil dependence. However, the factors affecting travel
   distances have not yet been investi-gated, which makes the development
   of effective transportation-related policy difficult. Therefore, we
   explore factors influencing travel distances in Japan, namely, income
   group, region, interest in purchasing a hybrid car, travel purposes,
   vehicle type, and demographics, using data collected through surveys.
   Subsequently, we examine whether the factors increasing travel distances
   also increase fuel usage in the transportation sec-tor. Several findings
   emerge: First, hybrid ownership is positively correlated to travel
   distances regardless of income level and interest in purchasing a hybrid
   car (hybrid interest). Second, income level has a positive relationship
   with travel distances. How-ever, individuals in the high-income group
   show negative coefficients towards travel distances. The results also
   show that factors increasing travel distance also positively affect fuel
   usage except for hybrid ownership. For example, hybrid ownership is
   posi-tively correlated with both travel distances and fuel consumption,
   which is a form of the ``green paradox.{''} Thus, the contribution of
   this study is that it provides evidence for the existence of direct
   rebound effects and wealth inequality in travel behavior and indicates
   the need for implementing policies based on individuals'
   socio-demographical identity and type of vehicle ownership. (c) 2020

   Approach for Designing Single-Atom Catalysts}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED MATERIALS INTERFACES}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{8, SI}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Graphene derivatives with anchored metal atoms represent a promising
   class of single-atom catalysts (SACs). To elucidate factors determining
   the bond strength between metal atoms and graphene derivatives, a series
   of late 3d and 4d elements, including the iron triad, light platinum
   group elements, and coinage metals (Fe, Co, Ni, Ru, Rh, Pd, Cu, Ag, and
   Au), in different oxidation states (from 0 to +III) bonded to either
   cyanographene (CG) or graphene acid (GA) is explored. The vast diversity
   of N center dot center dot center dot Me and O center dot center dot
   center dot Me bond dissociation energies is related to charge transfer
   between the metal and substrate. The ability of CG and GA to reduce
   metal cations and oxidize metal atoms is attributed to the pi-conjugated
   lattice of the graphene derivatives. The binding energies of core
   electrons of the anchored metals are predicted to enable experimental
   identification via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The anchoring of
   metals is accompanied by either complete or partial spin quenching,
   leading in most cases to the same oxidation state of the metal
   regardless of its initial charge. The identified features can be
   utilized in designing new materials with a high potential in
   heterogenous SACs as well as electrochemical and spintronic
   applications.}},

Title = {{Drinking Motives as Moderators of In-the-Moment Drinking Risks in
   Response to Trauma-Related Distress}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{44}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background Trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
   symptomatology are linked to increased risk for problematic drinking,
   yet the factors that increase such risk remain largely unknown.
   Theoretical models suggest that affectively oriented drinking motives
   may be central to trauma-related drinking. Specifically,
   individual-level motivations to drink to regulate affect may be
   important for moderating drinking urges that occur acutely in response
   to trauma cues. Further, elevated distress associated with PTSD
   symptomatology may increase any affectively motivated, momentary
   drinking risks. However, research has yet to examine these dynamic
   affective processes. In a large experimental sample, the current study
   tested whether affective (i.e., coping and enhancement) drinking motives
   and PTSD symptomatology moderated individuals' drinking urge in response
   to a trauma cue in a laboratory cue reactivity paradigm.
   Methods College drinkers (n = 611, 53\% female) were recruited and
   selected across levels of trauma exposure and PTSD symptomatology by a
   structured clinical interview. Participants were randomized to a
   personalized trauma or neutral cue, reporting on their urge to drink
   alcohol before and after cue exposure. Drinking motives were assessed at
   the end of the experimental session.
   Results Trauma cue associations with drinking urge were moderated by
   coping, but not enhancement, motives. Specifically, stronger coping
   motives were associated with increases in urge to drink alcohol
   following exposure to a trauma but not neutral cue. PTSD classification
   did not significantly moderate these associations.
   Conclusions Coping motives may increase drinking urge immediately
   following exposure to trauma cues and may differentiate individuals most
   at risk for problematic drinking during trauma-associated distress.
   Findings support momentary negative affect processes driving dynamic,
   immediate trauma-related drinking risks.}},

   of 25OHD(3) supplementation on performance, immunity, antioxidant
   capacity, intestinal morphology and bone quality in piglets.
   RESULTS As dietary 25OHD(3) supplementation increased, the average daily
   gain (ADG) improved (P < 0.05) quadratically during days 1-14, and
   tended to increase (P = 0.06) quadratically during the overall period of
   the experiment. Increasing 25OHD(3) supplementation increased (linear
   effect, P < 0.05) the serum 25OHD(3) level and serum glutathione
   peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity. On day 14, serum immunoglobulin A (IgA)
   was increased (linear and quadratic effects, P < 0.05) as dietary
   25OHD(3) supplementation increased. On day 28, serum IgA level was
   higher (P < 0.05) linearly and the complement 3 (C3) level was reduced
   (P < 0.05) linearly as dietary supplementation of 25OHD(3) increased.
   The mucosal GSH-Px activity of the small intestine was higher (quadratic
   effect, P < 0.05) with increasing 25OHD(3) supplementation. Jejunal
   villus height (P = 0.06) and villus height to crypt depth ratio (P =
   0.07) tended to increase quadratically, and the villus height to
   crypt-depth ratio of the ileum increased (P < 0.05) linearly and
   quadratically with increasing 25OHD(3) supplementation. Dietary
   supplementation with an increasing level of 25OHD(3) increased breaking
   strength of tibias and femurs (quadratic effect, P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSION Increasing dietary 25OHD(3) supplementation partly improved
   performance, immunity, antioxidant status, intestinal morphology, and
   bone properties of weaned piglets. (c) 2020 Society of Chemical Industry}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{The emergence of nitrogenous disinfection byproducts (N-DBPs) in
   drinking water has become a widespread concern. In this study,
   dichloroacetonitrile (DCAN), dicholoacetamide (DCAcAm) and
   trichloronitromethane (TCNM) were chosen as representatives to clarify
   the characteristics of N-DBP precursors in the raw waters of Taihu Lake,
   the Yangtze River, and Gaoyou Lake. Removal of DCAN and DCAcArn
   precursors must focus on nonpolar and positively charged organics, but
   more attention should be paid to micromolecular, polar and
   non-positively charged organics as TCNM precursors. Compared to
   molecular weight (MW) and hydrophilicity fractionation, polarity and
   electrical classification have higher selectivity to intercept N-DBP
   precursors. The properties of N-DBP precursors are relatively fixed and
   traceable in water systems, which could contribute to their targeted
   removal. Based on investigation of their characteristics, the removal
   efficiency and preferences of organic precursors under different
   processes were studied in three drinking water treatment plants
   (DVVTPs). The TCNM precursors produced in preozonation can be
   effectively removed during coagulation. The cumulative removal
   efficiency of conventional processes on N-DBP precursors was
   approximately 20-30\%, but O-3/BAC process improved removal by about
   40\%. The key to improving the removal efficiency of N-DBP precursors by
   O-3/BAC is that it can significantly remove low-MW, nonpolar, positively
   charged, hydrophilic and transphilic organics. In combined toxicity
   trials, both cytotoxicity and genotoxicity showed a synergistic effect
   when DCAN, DCAcAm. and TCNM coexisted, which means that low-level
   toxicity enhancement in the actual water merits attention. DCAN
   precursors dominated in the toxicity formation potential (TIP), followed
   by TCNM precursors. In addition, the removal rate of total N-DBP
   precursors may be higher than that of TIP, leading to overly optimistic
   evaluation of precursor removal in water treatment practice. Therefore,
   the removal effect on TEP must also be considered. (C) 2020 Elsevier

Title = {{Flexible and high-performance piezoresistive strain sensors based on
   carbon nanoparticles@polyurethane sponges}},
Journal = {{COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{In this work, flexible and high-performance piezoresistive strain
   sensors were fabricated by simple layer-by-layer electrostatic
   self-assembly of carbon nanoparticles on commercial polyurethane (PU)
   sponges. It was shown that the sponge-based strain sensors exhibited
   obviously positive and negative piezoresistive characteristics under
   tensile and compressive strains, respectively. The alternate assembly of
   carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) contributed to
   the construction of a more complete conductive network and significantly
   improved the sensing performance of the sensor due to the synergistic
   effect between CNTs and GNPs. Compared with the CNT@PU and CNT/GNP@PU
   sponge strain sensors, the CNT/GNP/CNT@PU sensor had a larger strain
   detection range and higher linearity. Besides, the CNT/GNP/CNT@PU sponge
   strain sensor showed high sensitivity (GF = 43,000 at 60\% tensile
   strain and GF = -1.1 at 50\% compressive strain), responsive capability
   to very small strain (0.05\%) and outstanding stability during 3000
   loading cycles. Due to its excellent sensing performance, the
   CNT/GNP/CNT@PU sensor enabled monitoring of various physiological
   activities, including finger movements, wrist bending and walking etc.
   In addition, a 5 x 5 sensor array based on the sponge-based strain
   sensor was prepared to achieve accurate identification of weight
   distribution. This study provides valuable information for the
   development of flexible strain sensors with high-performance and
   low-cost.}},

Abstract = {{Eight cold-formed thin-walled steel beams were performed to investigate
   the effect of corrosion damage on the flexural behavior of steel beams.
   The relationships between failure modes or load-displacement curves and
   corrosion degree of steel beams were investigated. A series of
   parametric analysis with more than forty finite element models were also
   performed with different corrosion degrees, types and locations. The
   results showed that the reduction of cross-section thickness as well as
   corrosion pits on the surface would lead to a decline in the stiffness
   and flexural capacity of steel beams, and gradually intensified with the
   corrosion degree. The yield load, ultimate load and critical buckling
   load of the corroded specimen IV-B46-4 decreased by 22.2\%, 26\% and
   45\%, respectively. The failure modes of steel beams changed from
   strength failure to stability failure or brittle fracture with the
   corrosion degree increasing. In addition, thickness damage and corrosion
   pits at different locations caused the degradation of flexural capacity,
   the worst of which was the thickness damage of compression zone.
   Finally, the method for calculating flexural capacity of corroded
   cold-formed thin-walled steel beams was also proposed based on
   experimental investigation and numerical analysis results.}},

Journal = {{ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Multicomponent compounds have been studied as anode materials for
   lithium-ion batteries since such compounds simultaneously satisfy
   electrochemical and structural requirements during charge/discharge
   processes. Herein, LiNbMoO6 manifests high initial charge/discharge
   specific capacities and excellent cycle performance when used as anode
   for lithium battery. Furthermore, after modifying with 1 wt\% Li2SiO3,
   the LiNbMoO6/Li2SiO3 composite delivers increased discharge capacity of
   250 mAh g(-1) at a current density of 500 mA g(-1) even after 1000
   cycles. The improved electrochemical performance is attributed to the
   improved ionic conductivity originating from the unique Li2SiO3 thin
   film, and the increased electron conductivity due to the introduction of
   oxygen vacancy in LiNbMoO6 through the preparation process. In addition,
   the detailed lithium storage mechanism of the LiNbMoO6/Li2SiO3 composite
   is revealed through ex-situ XPS combined with ex-situ XRD analysis. The
   unique electrode design strategy in this work would exert significant

Abstract = {{Tunable metasurfaces enable us to dynamically control light at
   subwavelength scales. Here, using phase change materials and transparent
   graphene heaters, a new structure is proposed to develop tunable
   metasurfaces which support first-order Mie-type resonance in the near-IR
   regime. In the proposed structure, by adjusting the bias voltages
   applied to transparent graphene heaters, the crystallization levels of
   the phase change materials are controlled, which in turn modifies the
   response of the metasurface. The proposed metasurface is able to
   modulate the phase of the reflected wave in the range of 0 degrees to
   -270 degrees at the telecommunication wavelength of lambda= 1.55 mu m. A
   comprehensive Joule heating analysis is performed to investigate the
   thermal characterizations of the proposed structure. The results of this
   analysis show that there is a suitable thermal isolation between
   adjacent unit cells, making individual control on unit cells possible.
   The potential ability of the proposed metasurface as a beam steering
   device is also demonstrated. By using the proposed unit cells, a
   beam-steering device is designed and numerically studied. This study
   shows that the device can reflect a light normally incident on it in the
   range of +/- 65 degrees with reasonably low sidelobe levels. The
   proposed structure can be used in developing low-cost integrated LiDARs.

Abstract = {{Childhood cancer survivors are at increased risk for second primary
   leukemia (SPL), but there is little consensus on the magnitude of some
   risk factors because of the small size of previous studies. We performed
   a pooled analysis of all published studies with detailed treatment data,
   including estimated active bone marrow (ABM) dose received during
   radiation therapy and doses of specific chemotherapeutic agents for
   childhood cancer diagnosed from 1930 through 2000, in order to more
   thoroughly investigate treatment-related risks of SPL. A total of 147
   SPL cases (of which 69\% were acute myeloid leukemia {[}AML]) were
   individually matched to 522 controls, all from four case-control studies
   including patients from six countries (France, United Kingdom, United
   States, Canada, Italy and Netherlands). Odds ratios (OR) and
   corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using
   conditional logistic regression, and the excess OR per Gray (EOR/Gy) was
   also calculated. After accounting for the other therapies received,
   topoisomerase II inhibitor was associated with an increased SPL risk
   (highest tertile vs none: OR = 10.0, 95\% CI: 3.7-27.3). Radiation dose
   to the ABM was also associated with increased SPL risk among those not
   receiving chemotherapy (EOR/Gy = 1.6, 95\% CI: 0.1-14.3), but not among
   those who received chemotherapy (CT). SPL were most likely to occur in
   the first decade following cancer treatment. Results were similar when
   analyses were restricted to AML. The evidence of interaction between
   radiation and CT has implications for leukemogenic mechanism. The
   results for topoisomerase II inhibitors are particularly important given
   their increasing use to treat childhood cancer.}},

Title = {{Streptococcal Infection as a Major Historical Cause of Stuttering: Data,
   Mechanisms, and Current Importance}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{Stuttering is one of the most well-known speech disorders, but the
   underlying neurological mechanisms are debated. In addition to genetic
   factors, there are also major non-genetic contributions. It is here
   proposed that infection with group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GAS)
   was a major underlying cause of stuttering until the mid-1900s when
   penicillin was introduced in 1943. The main mechanism proposed is an
   autoimmune reaction from tonsillitis, targeting specific molecules, for
   example within the basal ganglia. It is here also proposed that GAS
   infections may have continued to cause stuttering to some extent, to the
   present date, though more rarely. If so, early diagnosis of such cases
   would be of importance. Childhood cases with sudden onset of stuttering
   after throat infection may be particularly important to assess for
   possible GAS infection. The support for this hypothesis primarily comes
   from three lines of argument. First, medical record data from the 1930s
   strongly indicates that there was one type of medical event in
   particular that preceded the onset of childhood stuttering with
   unexpected frequency: diseases related to GAS throat infections. In
   particular, this included tonsillitis and scarlet fever, but also
   rheumatic fever. Rheumatic fever is a childhood autoimmune sequela of
   GAS infection, which was a relatively widespread medical problem until
   the early 1960s. Second, available reports of changes of the childhood
   prevalence of stuttering indicate striking parallels between stuttering
   and the incidence of rheumatic fever, with: (1) decline from the early
   1900s; (2) marked decline from the introduction of penicillin in the mid
   1940s; and (3) reaching a more stable level in the 1960s. The
   correlations between the data for stuttering and rheumatic fever after
   the introduction of penicillin are very high, at about 0.95. Third,
   there are established biological mechanisms linking GAS tonsillitis to
   immunological effects on the brain. Also, a small number of more recent
   case reports have provided further support for the hypothesis linking
   stuttering to GAS infection. Overall, it is proposed that the available
   data provides strong evidence for the hypothesis that GAS infection was
   a major cause of stuttering until the mid-1900s, interacting with
   genetic predisposition.}},

Title = {{Entrepreneurship in microfranchising: an emerging market perspective}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN EMERGING ECONOMIES}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   Building on the limitations of the efforts of aid agencies and
   non-governmental organisations to pull the poor out of poverty in low-
   and middle-income countries and declining opportunities for market
   expansion in high-income countries, microfranchising is being promoted
   as a pro-poor business model, which promotes entrepreneurship.
   Sub-Saharan Africa has become a fertile ground for the propagation of
   this model. However, contemporary studies on microfranchising have not
   sufficiently explored what motivates people to turn to this method of
   doing business.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Through the case of a microfranchise in Ghana (FanMilk), the purpose of
   this paper is to use qualitative methods to study motivations for
   engaging in entrepreneurship ventures in a microfranchise.
   Findings
   The findings reveal whether motivations for becoming microfranchise
   entrepreneurs change over time or are varied, and these changes are
   moderated by changing opportunities, challenges and demographic factors.
   Originality/value
   These findings contribute to knowledge on microfranchising in terms of
   theory, policy and practice. The findings also seek to stimulate further
   inquiry into microfranchising and its ability to create value for
   multiple parties when operating in emerging markets such as Africa.}},

Title = {{An optimization-based planning tool for on-demand mobility service
   operations}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION}},
Abstract = {{Regions worldwide are adopting and exploring low-speed automated
   electric shuttle (AES) service as an on-demand shared mobility service
   in dense geofenced urban areas. Building on this concept, the National
   Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) recently developed the Automated
   Mobility District (AMD) toolkit. The AMD toolkit-comprising of a travel
   micro-simulation model and an energy estimation model-estimates the
   mobility and energy impacts of a given shuttle configuration within an
   AMD. Early-stage AMD deployments need to find optimal operational
   configurations that include: (a) passenger capacity of an AES, (b)
   time-dependent routes, and (c) fleet size (AES units) to satisfy the
   demand for the region. This research extends the AMD toolkit
   functionality by developing an optimization-based planning module that
   will assist in the operations of AES units. We developed a constrained
   mixed-integer program accounting for passenger waiting time, battery
   range, and passenger capacity of AES units. For scalability, we
   demonstrated the Tabu search-based solution technique for a real-world
   network-a proposed AMD deployment in Greenville, South Carolina, USA.
   Compared to rule-based operations, our developed solution yields higher
   travel time and energy savings for the network at different demand
   levels. The sensitivity analyses for waiting time thresholds indicate
   nonlinearity in the system performance, underscoring the need to meet
   shared-use mobility user-level expectations. The developed optimization
   framework can be adapted and extended to accommodate different
   categories of shared-use on-demand mobility services.}},

Abstract = {{Borneol is a commonly used flavouring substance in traditional Chinese
   medicine, which possesses several pharmacological activities including
   analgesic, antiinflammatory, and antioxidant properties. The aim of this
   study was to investigate the effects of borneol on cerulein-induced
   acute pancreatitis (AP) model. Swiss albino mice were pretreated with
   borneol (100 and 300 mg/kg) daily for 7 days, before six consecutive
   injections of cerulein (50 mu g/kg/hr, intraperitoneally). The
   protective effect of borneol was studied by biochemical, enzyme linked
   immunosorbent assay, histological, immunoblotting, and
   immunohistochemical analysis. Oral administration of borneol
   significantly attenuated pancreatic damage by reducing amylase, lipase
   levels and histological changes. Borneol attenuated cerulein-induced
   oxidative-nitrosative stress by decreasing malondialdehyde, nitrite
   levels, and elevating reduced glutathione levels. Pancreatic
   inflammation was ameliorated by inhibiting myeloperoxidase activity and
   pro-inflammatory cytokine (Interleukins and TNF-alpha) levels.
   Furthermore, borneol administration significantly increased nuclear
   factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), superoxide dismutase (SOD1)
   expression and reduced phospho-NF-kappa B p65 expression. Treatment with
   borneol significantly inhibited TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and
   inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in cerulein-induced AP mouse
   model. Together, these results indicate that borneol which is currently
   used as US-FDA approved food adjuvant has the potential to attenuate
   cerulein-induced AP possibly by reducing the oxidative damage and
   pancreatic inflammation by modulating Nrf2/NF-kappa B pathway.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES The aims of this study were to investigate the feasibility of
   coronary ostia cannulation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement
   (TAVR) and to assess potential predictors of coronary access impairment.
   BACKGROUND Certain data concerning the feasibility and reproducibility
   of coronary cannulation after TAVR are lacking.
   METHODS RE-ACCESS (Reobtain Coronary Ostia Cannulation Beyond
   Transcatheter Aortic Valve Stent) was an investigator-driven,
   single-center, prospective, registry-based study that enrolled
   consecutive patients undergoing TAVR using all commercially available
   devices. All patients underwent coronary angiography before and after
   TAVR. The primary endpoint was the rate of unsuccessful coronary ostia
   cannulation after TAVR. Secondary endpoints were the identification of
   factors associated with the inability to selectively cannulate coronary
   ostia after TAVR.
   RESULTS Among 300 patients enrolled in the RE-ACCESS study from December
   2018 to January 2020, a total of 23 cases (7.7\%) of unsuccessful
   coronary cannulation after TAVR were documented. This issue occurred in
   22 of 23 cases with the use of Evolut R/PRO transcatheter aortic valves
   (TAVs) (17.9\% vs. 0.4\%; p < 0.01). In multivariate analysis, the use
   of Evolut R/PRO TAVs (odds ratio {[}OR]: 29.6; 95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI]: 2.6 to 335.0; p < 0.01), the TAV-sinus of Valsalva relation (OR:
   1.1 per 1-mm increase; 95\% CI: 1.0 to 1.2; p < 0.01), and the mean TAV
   implantation depth (OR: 1.7 per 1-mm decrease; 95\% CI: 1.3 to 2.3; p <
   0.01) were found to be independent predictors of unsuccessful coronary
   cannulation after TAVR. A model combining these factors was demonstrated
   to predict with very high accuracy the risk for unsuccessful coronary
   cannulation after TAVR (area under the curve: 0.94; p < 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS Unsuccessful coronary cannulation following TAVR was
   observed in 7.7\% of patients and occurred almost exclusively in those
   receiving Evolut TAVs. The combination of Evolut TAV, a higher TAV-sinus
   of Valsalva relation, and implantation depth predicts with high accuracy
   the risk for unsuccessful coronary cannulation after TAVR. (Reobtain

Title = {{Determinants for the adoption of residential rainwater harvesting

Abstract = {{In recent years, the mountainous regions are becoming more susceptible
   to devastating climatic shocks causing food insecurity and environmental
   degradation. In response, farmers with small landholding are gaining
   interest in deploying Residential Rainwater Harvesting Systems (RRWHS)
   to improve water supplies in homes, though diminutive consideration has
   been given to the performance evaluation of these systems in a
   mountainous landscape in the tropics. Our study intended to explicitly
   understand the determinants for the household adoption of RRWHS and
   evaluate their performance to improve domestic water supplies in the
   study area. The study took a cross-sectional design were 444 respondents
   were selected using a cluster sampling method, and administered with
   semi-structured questionnaires. The indicators used to assess system
   performances were: reliability, cost-effectiveness and efficiency. The
   results of this study showed that system/component price-subsidies,
   household income-status, landholding-size, availability of technical
   support and farmer education-level were the most significant
   determinants for the uptake of RRWHS (P < = 0.05). Performance-wise, the
   most reliable systems were corrugated metallic-tanks and
   concrete-ferro-cement tanks. The most cost-effective system was plastic
   jerrycans; while the most-efficient were concrete ferro-cement and
   plastic tanks. This study reveals that tax exemptions on the manufacture
   and importation of RRWHS components can increase their acquisition. The
   high-capacity storage RRWHS systems are preferred by the farmers due to
   improved water supplies to sustain domestic usage and farming
   requirements but also safeguard the environment from surface run-off and
   overexploitation. Plastic-storage facilities are preferred, because they
   did not react with water compared to metallic systems.}},

   concentration in mountain drainage basins: implications for functional

Abstract = {{We examine the sensitivity of Be-10 concentrations (and derived
   denudation rates), to debris-flow and anthropogenic perturbations in
   steep settings of the Eastern Alps, and explore possible relations with
   structural geomorphic connectivity. Using cosmogenic Be-10 as a tracer
   for functional geomorphic connectivity, we conduct sampling replications
   across four seasons in Gadria, Strimm and Allitz Creek. Sampling sites
   encompass a range of structural connectivity configurations, including
   the conditioning of a sackung, all assessed through a geomorphometric
   index (IC). By combining information on contemporary depth of erosion
   and sediment yield, disturbance history and post-LGM (Last Glacial
   Maximum) sedimentation rates, we constrain the effects of debris-flow
   disturbance on Be-10 concentrations at the Gadria sites. Here, we argue
   that bedrock weakening imparted by the sackung promotes high depth of
   erosion. Consequently, debris flows recruit sediment beyond the critical
   depth of spallogenic production (e.g., >3 m), which in turn,
   episodically, due to predominantly muogenic production pathways, lowers
   Be-10 concentration by a factor of 4, for at least 2 years. In contrast,
   steady erosion in Strimm Creek yields very stable Be-10 concentrations
   through time. In Allitz Creek, we observe two- to fourfold seasonal
   fluctuations in Be-10 concentrations, which we explain as the combined
   effects of water diversion and hydraulic structures on sediment mixing.
   We further show that Be-10 concentration correlates inversely with the
   IC index, where sub-basins characterized by high concentrations (long
   residence times) exhibit low IC values (structurally disconnected) and
   vice versa, implying that, over millennial time scales a direct relation
   exists between functional and structural connectivity, and that the IC
   index performed as a suitable metric for structural connectivity. The
   index performs comparably better than other metrics (i.e., mean slope
   and mean normalized channel steepness index) previously used to assess
   topographic controls on denudation rates in active unglaciated ranges.
   In terms of landscape evolution, we argue that the sackung, by favouring
   intense debris-flow activity across the Holocene, has aided rapid
   postglacial reshaping of the Gadria basin, which currently exhibits a
   topographic signature characteristic of unglaciated debris-flow systems.

Abstract = {{Rationale Ketamine, a well-known general dissociative anesthetic agent
   that is a non-competitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate
   receptor, perturbs the perception of elapsed time and the expectation of
   upcoming events. Objective The objective of this study was to determine
   the influence of ketamine on temporal expectation in the rhesus monkey.
   Methods Two rhesus monkeys were trained to make a saccade between a
   central warning stimulus and an eccentric visual target that served as
   imperative stimulus. The delay between the warning and the imperative
   stimulus could take one of four different values randomly with the same
   probability (variable foreperiod paradigm). During experimental
   sessions, a subanesthetic low dose of ketamine (0.25-0.35 mg/kg) was
   injected i.m. and the influence of the drug on movement latency was
   measured. Results We found that in the control conditions, saccadic
   latencies strongly decreased with elapsed time before the appearance of
   the visual target showing that temporal expectation built up during the
   delay period between the warning and the imperative stimulus. However,
   after ketamine injection, temporal expectation was significantly reduced
   in both subjects. In addition, ketamine also increased average movement
   latency but this effect could be dissociated from the reduction of
   temporal expectation. Conclusion In conclusion, a subanesthetic dose of
   ketamine could have two independent effects: increasing reaction time
   and decreasing temporal expectation. This alteration of temporal
   expectation could explain cognitive deficits observed during ketamine
   use.}},

   milk, a single internal standard was insufficient for the analysis and
   required sectioning the spectrum into three portions based upon mass
   range to provide accurate quantitation of TAG species. Isobaric
   phospholipid interferences were removed using a simple dispersive
   solid-phase extraction step. Using this method, > 100 TAG species were

Abstract = {{Evidence is accumulating that cognitive function, and visual impairment
   may be related. In this pilot study, we investigated whether
   multifractal dimension and lacunarity analyses performed in sectoral
   regions of the retina may reveal changes in patients with cognitive
   impairment (CI) that may be masked in the study considering the whole
   retinal branching pattern. Prospective age-matched subjects (n = 69)
   with and with no CI and without the presence of any ophthalmic history
   were recruited (age > 55+ years). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment
   (MoCA) was used to measure CI, and full-field electroretinogram (ERG)
   was performed. Also, visual performance exams were conducted using the
   Rabin cone contrast test (CCT). Quantification of the retinal structure
   was performed in retinal fundus images {[}45(o) field of view (FOV),
   optic disk centered] with excellent quality for all individuals {[}19
   healthy controls (HC) and 20 patients with CI] after evaluating the
   inclusion and exclusion criteria in all study participants recruited (n
   = 69). The skeletonized vasculature network that comprised the whole
   branching pattern observable in the full 45 degrees FOV was obtained for
   each image and divided into nine equal regions (superotemporal,
   superior, superonasal, macular, optic disk, nasal, inferotemporal,
   inferior, and inferonasal). The multifractal behavior was analyzed by
   calculating the generalized dimension Dq (Do, D1, and D2), the
   lacunarity parameter (?), and singularity spectrum f(alpha) in the nine
   sectoral skeletonized images as well as in the skeletons that comprised
   the whole branching pattern observable in the full 45 degrees FOV. The
   analyses were performed using the ImageJ program together with the
   FracLac plug-in. Independent sample t-tests or Mann Whitney U test and
   Pearson correlation coefficient were used to find associations between
   all parameters in both groups. The effect size (Cohen's d) of the
   difference between both groups was also assessed. A p-value < 0.05 was
   considered statistically significant. Significant correlations between
   multifractal and ? parameters with the MoCA and implicit time
   ERG-parameter were observed in the regional analysis. In contrast, no
   trend was found when considering the whole retinal branching pattern.
   Analysis of combined structural-functional parameters in sectoral
   regions of the retina, instead of individual retinal biomarkers, may
   provide a useful clinical marker of CI.}},

Abstract = {{We consider simple scalar theories with quadratic terms that are
   nonlocal and Lorentz violating. Unlike similar Lorentz-invariant
   nonlocal theories that we have considered previously, the theories
   studied here are both ghost-free and unitary as formulated in Minkowski
   space. We explore the possibility that the scale of nonlocality could be
   low in a dark sector, where the stringent constraints on the violation
   of Lorentz invariance may be accommodated via the weak coupling to the
   standard model. We point out that long-range forces may originate from
   such a sector and be distinguishable from more conventional
   beyond-the-standard-model possibilities. We present a model in which a
   nonlocal, Lorentz-violating dark sector communicates with the standard
   model via a sector of heavy vectorlike fermions, a concrete framework in
   which phenomenological constraints and signals can be investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction Neoadjuvant imatinib (Neo-IM) therapy may facilitate R0
   resection in primary gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) that are
   large or in difficult anatomic locations. While response to preoperative
   tyrosine kinase inhibitors is associated with better outcome in
   metastatic GIST, little is known about prognostic factors after Neo-IM
   in primary GIST. Study Design Patients with primary GIST with or without
   synchronous metastases who underwent Neo-IM were retrospectively
   analyzed from a prospective maintained institutional database for
   Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), tumor viability,
   and mitotic rate. Overall survival (OS) was estimated by Kaplan-Meier
   and compared by log-rank test. Cox proportionate hazard models were used
   for univariate and multivariate analysis. Results One hundred and fifty
   patients were treated for a median of 7.1 months (range 0.2-160). By
   RECIST, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease were
   seen in 40\%, 51\%, and 9\%, respectively. By pathologic analysis, <=
   50\% of the tumor was viable in 72\%, and the mitotic rate was <=
   5/50HPF in 74\%. On multivariate analysis, RECIST response and tumor
   viability were not associated with OS, while post-treatment high mitotic
   rate (hazard ratio (HR) for death 5.3, CI 2.3-12.4), R2 margins (HR 6.0,
   CI 2.3-15.5), and adjuvant imatinib (HR 0.4, CI 0.2-0.9) were (p <
   0.05). Five-year OS was 81 vs. 38\% for low vs. high mitotic rate; 81,
   59, and 39\% for R0, R1, and R2 margins; and 75 vs 61\% for adjuvant vs.
   no adjuvant imatinib therapy (p < 0.05). Conclusions In primary GIST
   undergoing Neo-IM therapy, progression was uncommon, but substantial
   down-sizing occurred in the minority. High tumor mitotic rate and
   incomplete resection following Neo-IM were associated with poor outcome,
   while adjuvant imatinib was associated with prolonged survival.}},

Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{The evolution of mobile multimedia computing and artificial intelligence
   represents a significant challenge in terms of real-time data processing
   and data protection management. It can be seen in the EU and US, where
   governments are adapting their regulation laws to meet current and
   future societal requirements. However, existing solutions provide
   limited capabilities and operate in isolation, focusing on protecting
   particular rights of citizens. The main contribution of the article at
   hand is a novel platform, called PROTECTOR, that protects sensitive data
   of EU and US citizens according to the rights provided by current EU/US
   data protection regulation laws. Three case studies prove how PROTECTOR
   deals with several citizen's rights in two different legislation
   environments, such as the EU GDPR and the US. Finally, a pool of
   experiments with a different number of citizens, policies, and data have
   demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed solution.}},

Abstract = {{The core of labor education is to shape labor values. For China, a

   government policies of Chinese scholars, the present study constructed a
   scale on labor values from five dimensions: honest labor value, equality
   status of labor value, cherishing labor value, loving labor value, and
   distribution value according to work. By using exploratory factor
   analysis and confirmatory factor analysis, this scale was able to
   achieve high reliability and validity, as well as high external
   correlation validity. Notably, this was the first study to develop a
   scale on labor values from the perspective of empirical research,
   promoting an empirical trend in labor value research.}},

Abstract = {{There is an urgent need to develop a selective hydrogenolysis of
   C-aryl-O bonds in lignin to produce valued-added chemicals and fuels.
   Recently, hydrogen has been used in the hydrogenation reaction, which
   hides inevitable danger and is not economical. Therefore, isopropanol,
   as a hydrogen-donor solvent, is employed for aryl ether hydrogenolysis
   in lignin models over nickel supported on a carbon nanotube (CNT).
   Except for aromatic ether (4-O-5), the Ni/CNT catalyst is also found to
   be suitable for alkyl-aryl ether (alpha-O-4 and beta-O-4) cleavage in
   control experiments. The physicochemical characterizations were carried
   out by means of H-2-temperature-programmed reduction, X-ray diffraction,
   transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   analyses. The catalyst can be magnetically recovered and efficiently
   reused for five consecutive recycling tests in the transfer
   hydrogenation of aromatic ethers. A mechanism study indicated that the
   hydrogenolysis cleavage of the ether bond is the first step in the
   reaction process, and hydrogenation of aromatic rings is only a
   successive step in which phenol and benzene are intermediate states and
   are then further hydrogenated. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated
   that aryl groups play an important role in the hydrogenation of phenol
   in the competitive catalytic hydrogenation reaction of phenol.}},

Abstract = {{CCCH zinc finger proteins are a class of important zinc-finger
   transcription factors and have functions in various plant growth and
   stress responses, but their functions in moso bamboo (Phyllostachys
   edulis) are unclear. In this current study, we main investigated the
   structures, phylogenetic relationships, promoter elements and
   microsynteny of PeC3Hs. In this research, 119 CCCH zinc finger proteins
   (PeC3H1-119) identified genes in moso bamboo were divided into 13
   subfamilies (A-M) based on phylogenetic analysis. Meanwhile, moso bamboo
   were treated with abscisic acid (ABA), methyl jasmonate (Me-JA) and
   gibberellic acid (GA) and 12 CCCH genes expression levels were assayed
   using qRT-PCR. In the three hormone treatments, 12 genes were
   up-regulated or down-regulated, respectively. In addition, PeC3H74 was
   localized on the cytomembrane, and it had self-activation activities.
   Phenotypic and physiological analysis showed that PeC3H74 (PeC3H74-OE)
   conferred drought tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis, including H2O2
   content, survival rate, electrolyte leakage as well as malondialdehyde
   content. Additionally, compared with wild-type plants, transgenic
   Arabidopsis thaliana seedling roots growth developed better under 10 mu
   M ABA; Moreover, the stomatal of over-expressing PeC3H74 in Arabidopsis
   changed significantly under ABA treatment. The above results suggest
   that PeC3H74 was quickly screened by bioinformatics, and it may enhanced
   drought tolerance in plants through the ABA-dependent signaling pathway.}},

Title = {{Physical and Mechanical Performance of Frozen Rocks and Soil in
   Different Regions}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{The artificial freezing method is extensively used in the reinforcement
   of engineering strata in various regions for shaft excavation and subway
   connection channels. In this study, representative rock and soil strata
   from different regions were subjected to low-temperature physical and
   mechanical performance tests. The results show that, compared with
   Cretaceous and Jurassic rock and soil strata, deep topsoil and shallow
   coastal topsoil have high water content, low thermal conductivities,
   high frost heave rates, and high freezing temperatures. In addition, the
   results show that, as the curing temperature decreases, the uniaxial
   compressive strengths and elastic moduli of deep topsoil and shallow
   coastal topsoil increase almost linearly. The strength of the sandy soil
   strata is the highest, followed by the cohesive soil strata, and the
   strength of the mucky soil and the calcareous clay is the lowest. The
   strength of the frozen wall and the waterproof requirements must both be
   taken into account in the freezing design. Deep Cretaceous and Jurassic
   rocks can have high strength of more than 5 MPa under normal temperature
   conditions. An increase in the uniaxial compressive strength and elastic
   modulus with decreasing curing temperature is mainly manifested within
   the range from the normal temperature to -10 degrees C. The strength can
   reach more than 10 MPa at -10 degrees C, and only the strength
   requirements of the frozen wall need to be considered in the freezing
   design. At low temperatures, deep topsoil and shallow coastal topsoil
   are dominated by the form of compression failure. The average failure
   strain at -10 degrees C is typically greater than 5\%. When excavating
   the strata, it is essential to pay attention to the effect of creep. The
   failure strain of deep Cretaceous and Jurassic rocks is between 1\% and
   2\%, and the breaking and sudden collapse of surrounding rocks should be
   prevented.}},

Title = {{Generating anthropomorphic phantoms using fully unsupervised deformable
   image registration with convolutional neural networks}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Computerized phantoms have been widely used in nuclear medicine
   imaging for imaging system optimization and validation. Although the
   existing computerized phantoms can model anatomical variations through
   organ and phantom scaling, they do not provide a way to fully reproduce
   the anatomical variations and details seen in humans. In this work, we
   present a novel registration-based method for creating highly
   anatomically detailed computerized phantoms. We experimentally show
   substantially improved image similarity of the generated phantom to a
   patient image.
   Methods: We propose a deep-learning-based unsupervised registration
   method to generate a highly anatomically detailed computerized phantom
   by warping an XCAT phantom to a patient computed tomography (CT) scan.
   We implemented and evaluated the proposed method using the NURBS-based
   XCAT phantom and a publicly available low-dose CT dataset from TCIA. A
   rigorous tradeoff analysis between image similarity and deformation
   regularization was conducted to select the loss function and
   regularization term for the proposed method. A novel SSIM-based
   unsupervised objective function was proposed. Finally, ablation studies
   were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method (using
   the optimal regularization and loss function) and the current
   state-of-the-art unsupervised registration methods.
   Results: The proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art
   registration methods, such as SyN and VoxelMorph, by more than 8\%,
   measured by the SSIM and less than 30\%, by the MSE. The phantom
   generated by the proposed method was highly detailed and was almost
   identical in appearance to a patient image.
   Conclusions: A deep-learning-based unsupervised registration method was
   developed to create anthropomorphic phantoms with anatomies labels that
   can be used as the basis for modeling organ properties. Experimental
   results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The
   resulting anthropomorphic phantom is highly realistic. Combined with
   realistic simulations of the image formation process, the generated
   phantoms could serve in many applications of medical imaging research.

Abstract = {{Defect classification is the key task of a steel surface defect
   detection system. The current defect classification algorithms have not
   taken the feature noise into consideration. In order to reduce the
   adverse impact of feature noise, an anti-noise multi-class
   classification method was proposed for steel surface defects. On the one
   hand, a novel anti-noise support vector hyper-spheres (ASVHs) classifier
   was formulated. For N types of defects, the ASVHs classifier built N
   hyper-spheres. These hyper-spheres were insensitive to feature and label
   noise. On the other hand, in order to reduce the costs of online time
   and storage space, the defect samples were pruned by support vector data
   description with parameter iteration adjustment strategy. In the end,
   the ASVHs classifier was built with sparse defect samples set and
   auxiliary information. Experimental results show that the novel
   multi-class classification method has high efficiency and accuracy for
   corrupted defect samples in steel surface.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a system for an integrated evaluation of the
   implementation of small hydroelectric power plants (SHPs), based on a
   soft decision tree. The method generates the enterprise's sustainability
   index, where economic, environmental, and social aspects are considered
   in its interactions, with indicators measured in the field, sectoral
   indexes, and final index generated by fuzzy logic rule blocks. The
   methodology used to select the indicators and indexes followed four
   phases. First, a fuzzy expert system (FES) was developed in the form of
   a soft decision tree. Then, the array of suggested variables and weights
   were submitted to expert analysis using the Delphi methodology, and
   their assessments were collected. The third phase was the improvement of
   the system, taking into account the obtained considerations. In the
   fourth phase, the system was applied to a case study based on the
   installation of an SHP in the southern region of Brazil. The results
   obtained in the case study showed the sustainability of the enterprise.
   The presented method can have a significant contribution in supporting
   decisions regarding the licensing of hydroelectric projects.}},

Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{This paper concentrates on the problem of finite-time altitude and
   velocity tracking control for hypersonic flight vehicles that encounter
   unmodeled dynamics and input saturations. An adaptive neural finite-time
   backstepping control strategy is constructed by designing modified
   virtual commands and compensation signals. The minimum learning
   parameter algorithm based on a radial basis function is employed to
   approximate the unknown dynamics with low computational burden.
   Furthermore, an auxiliary system is established to cope with the
   nonlinearity caused by actuator saturation. It is concluded by a
   Lyapunov-based analysis that the finite-time stability is guaranteed
   under the developed architecture. Finally, numeral simulation is
   provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose The role of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in breast cancer
   patients who undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) remains
   controversial. This study aims to investigate if axillary lymph node
   dissection (ALND) could be safely omitted after a negative SLNB in cN1/2
   patients who become cN0 after NAC. Methods We retrospectively assessed
   T1-4, cN1/2 patients who were submitted to NAC between 2010 and 2016.
   T1-T3 patients who achieved complete axillary clinical response
   underwent SLNB. Those whose SLNs were negative were not subjected to
   additional ALND. The oncological outcomes of the patients were analyzed.
   Results Fifty-nine T1-T3 patients (45.0\%) achieved a complete axillary
   response (cN0), and were selected to undergo SLNB. SLNs were detected in
   55 of them (93.2\%). Seventeen of those patients (30.9\%) had SLN
   metastases detected and subsequently underwent ALND. In contrast, 38
   patients (69.1\%) had no nodal metastases detected and were managed
   without complementary ALND. After a mean follow-up of 55.8 months, only
   one patient (2.6\%) submitted to SLNB without a complementary ALND had
   axillary recurrence as compared with three patients (3.2\%) in the ALND
   group (p = 0.71). Distant recurrence occurred more frequently among
   patients submitted to ALND (92.1\%) than among those only submitted to
   SLNB (7.9\%) (p < 0.0006). Overall survival and disease-free survival
   were significantly better in patients who were not submitted to ALND.
   Conclusion SLNB could be successfully used in guiding a more selective
   axillary approach in cN+ patients that became cN0 after NAC. Omitting
   ALND in CN0 patients with negative SLNs did not seem to compromise
   disease control and oncological outcomes.}},

Title = {{My fault or yours? Leaders' dual reactions to abusive supervision via
   rumination depend on their independent self-construal}},
Journal = {{PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{In this research, we propose a novel goal-failure perspective based on
   cognitive theories of rumination to examine how leaders react to their
   own abusive supervision in distinct ways. Findings from two multi-wave,
   multisource field studies conducted with organizational leaders and an
   online experiment support hypotheses that leaders ruminate on their
   abusive behavior and this rumination triggers reconciliation efforts (a
   problem-solving reaction) or the blaming of victims (a self-serving
   reaction). In line with cognitive theories of rumination, leaders'
   independent self-construal functions as a key qualifier for the effects
   of rumination, such that when they ruminate, leaders who have low levels
   of independent self-construal are more likely to seek reconciliation,
   whereas leaders who have high levels of independent self-construal are
   more likely to blame their victims. Furthermore, reconciliation is not
   significantly related to subordinates' evaluation of their leaders'
   effectiveness but blaming is negatively related to it. These findings
   are an important extension of nascent perpetrator-centric research
   regarding abusive supervision.}},

   non-TNF inhibitors in anti-HTLV-1 antibody-positive patients with RA.
   Methods
   We reviewed patients with RA who received abatacept or tocilizumab as
   the first biologic agent. We used the data of patients treated with TNF
   inhibitors from our previous study to compare the effectiveness between
   the anti-HTLV-1 antibody-positive patients treated with TNF inhibitors
   and non-TNF inhibitors using the inverse probability of treatment
   weights (IPTW) method.
   Results
   A total of 359 patients were divided into anti-HTLV-1 antibody-negative
   and -positive patients of 332 and 27, respectively. No statistically
   significant difference was observed in the change in the clinical
   disease activity index between the anti-HTLV-1 antibody-positive and
   -negative patients. The results using the IPTW method showed a
   significant association between the non-TNF inhibitors treatment and a
   better response. None of the patients developed adult T-cell
   leukemia/lymphoma or HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic
   paraparesis during the 24 weeks.
   Conclusion
   Our results indicate that non-TNF inhibitors treatment is safety, and
   the effectiveness is not attenuated also in anti-HTLV-1
   antibody-positive patients.}},

Abstract = {{The exponential increase in cases and mortality of coronavirus disease
   (COVID-19) has called for a need to develop drugs to treat this
   infection. Using in silico and molecular docking approaches, this study
   investigated the inhibitory effects of Pradimicin A, Lamivudine,
   Plerixafor and Lopinavir against SARS-CoV-2 M-pro. ADME/Tox of the
   ligands, pharmacophore hypothesis of the co-crystalized ligand and the
   receptor, and docking studies were carried out on different modules of
   Schrodinger (2019-4) Maestro v12.2. Among the ligands subjected to
   ADME/Tox by QikProp, Lamivudine demonstrated drug-like physico-chemical
   properties. A total of five pharmacophore binding sites (A3, A4, R9,
   R10, and R11) were predicted from the co-crystalized ligand and the
   binding cavity of the SARS-CoV-2 M-pro. The docking result showed that
   Lopinavir and Lamivudine bind with a higher affinity and lower free
   energy than the standard ligand having a glide score of -9.2 kcal/mol
   and -5.3 kcal/mol, respectively. Plerixafor and Pradimicin A have a
   glide score of -3.7 kcal/mol and -2.4 kcal/mol, respectively, which is
   lower than the co-crystallized ligand with a glide score of -5.3
   kcal/mol. Molecular dynamics confirmed that the ligands maintained their
   interaction with the protein with lower RMSD fluctuations over the
   trajectory period of 100 nsecs and that GLU166 residue is pivotal for
   binding. On the whole, present study specifies the repurposing aptitude
   of these molecules as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 M-pro with higher binding
   scores and forms energetically stable complexes with M-pro.

Journal = {{NUMERICAL METHODS FOR PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS}},
Abstract = {{In the current paper, a space-time spectral-Galerkin method is presented
   for the one- and two-dimensional (1D \& 2D) fourth-order time-fractional
   partial integro-differential equation (TFPIDE) with a weakly singular
   kernel. In temporal direction, a Petrov-Galerkin approach is used for
   discretization. Indeed, eigenfunctions of the first and second kind
   fractional Sturm-Liouville problem (FSLP), which called Jacobi
   polyfractonomials, are used as temporal basis for the trial and test
   spaces, respectively. Also, spatial discretization is based on the
   Galerkin approximation with a combination of Legendre polynomials as
   basis. Fully discrete scheme, give rises to obtaining approximate
   solution of desired problem via solving a system of linear algebraic
   equations. Spectral accuracy and efficiency of the considered method are
   numerically demonstrated by some test problems with smooth and
   non-smooth exact solutions in one- and two-dimensional cases.}},

Abstract = {{Polyphenylchromium(III) organometallics with various phenylation degrees
   and stabilized by diverse Lewis bases with various donor strengths and
   denticity were investigated in order to better understand the formation
   of (eta(6)-arene)chromium complexes according to the procedure of Franz
   Hein (1892-1976) {[}Organometallics 2019, 38, 498-511, DOI:
   10.1021/acs.organomet.8b00811]. Part II focuses on hexa-, penta-, and
   tetraphenylchromates(III). Chromium(III) compounds with a lower
   phenylation degree will be discussed in a future part III. The numbering
   scheme of the complexes relates to the number of Cr-bound phenyl
   substituents. Hexaphenylchromate(III): The reaction of
   Ph3Cr(thf)(3).0.25dx (3) (dx = 1,4-dioxane) with an ethereal solution of
   phenyllithium yields yellow-orange {[}Li3CrPh6(th)(2.3)(OEt2)(0.7)]
   (6-thf-OEt2) which slowly degrades in contact with the reaction solution
   leading to emerald-green crystals of
   {[}\{(Et2O)Li\}(2)Ph3Cr(mu-O)](2)(3-Li2O). Pentaphenylchromate(III):
   Compound 6-thf-OEt2 reacts with 1 equiv of HCl-OEt2 solution to
   turquoise {[}\{(th)(2)Li\}\{(Et2O)Li\}CrPh5] (5-thf-OEt2) that reacts
   with THF to the green contact ion pair {[}\{(thf)(2)Li\}(2)CrPh5]
   (5-thf) and with 12-crown-4 (12C4) to the light green solvent-separated
   ion pair {[}(12C4)Li(thf)](2) {[}CrPh5] (5-thf-12C4). Refluxing of
   5-thf-OEt2 in diethyl ether leads to ether degradation and formation of
   3- Li2O, whereas 5-thf-12C4 liberates biphenyl under similar reaction
   conditions. Tetraphenylchromate(III): The reaction of 3 with 1 equiv of
   phenyllithium in THF leads to a green reaction mixture. At -50 degrees
   C, red {[}(thf)(4)Li] {[}cis-(thf)(2)CrPh4]center dot 2THF (4-thf)
   crystallizes which reversibly transforms into a green oil above -50
   degrees C. Upon acidolysis of 5-thf-OEt2 with 1 equiv of HCl-OEt2 at -20
   degrees C, the intermediately formed red complex is reduced to the
   dinuclear chromate(II) {[}\{(thf)Li\}CrPh3](2) (3-Cr-II-thf) (Cr-Cr
   187.66(8) pm). Recrystallization of this product from THF yields
   solvent-separated {[}(thf)(4)Li](2) {[}(CrPh3)(2)] (3-Cr-II-thf(4)) with
   a Cr- Cr quadruple bond (Cr-Cr 183.7(2) pm) without contacts between the
   lithium ions and Cr-bound phenyl groups. Complex 3-Cr-II-thf reacts at
   room temperature in diethyl ether to the sandwich complexes
   bis(biphenyl)chromium(0) {[}(eta(6)-ph(2))(2)Cr-0] (pi-4) and
   benzene-biphenylchromium (0) {[}(eta(6)-C6H6)(eta(6)-ph(2))Cr-0](pi-3).

   wavenumbers as variables. In the case of one-class approaches, the
   selection of variables (16 wavenumbers) was necessary, improving the
   classification error to 5\%. The differences observed using the
   different methods were related to the nature of each model depending on
   how the boundaries are set in each of them, responding either to a

   ethanol/water (30\%, v/v) mixture, at a peel:solvent ratio of 1:50. MTS
   extraction reduced the extraction time by 40 times compared with
   conventional extraction (35 degrees C and 60 min) for achieving the same
   amount of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). The samples treated
   under 500 kPa for 3 min had the highest TPC (1007 pmol GA/g DW) and AOA
   (1.57 mmol TE/g DW). Nanocomplexes produced from PPI-PE and PPI-S-PE had
   similar encapsulation efficiency (-73\%). The mean diameters of
   freeze-dried PPI-PE complexes were 54.5 +/- 19.7 nm, as determined by
   ImageJ, while that of PPI-PE in emulsion was 111.3 +/- 6.4 nm measured
   by dynamic light scattering (DLS). MTS is shown to be a green and
   efficient alternative to improve the extraction of bioactive compounds
   from pomegranate peel waste.}},

Journal = {{CUREUS}},

Abstract = {{Gout is one of the most common diseases affecting men globally due to
   the spread of unhealthy dietary habits, kidney disease, and the use of
   diuretics. It is characterized as having monosodium crystals depositions
   in the synovial fluid, which causes an inflammatory response and painful
   joints. Most of the time, it can be found affecting the first
   metatarsophalangeal joint or other large joints in concurrence with
   other disorders. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
   colchicine, and steroids have been known to suppress such events in most
   cases without the need for any surgical intervention. We present a case
   of a 44-years-old medically free healthy male who presented with a case
   of gouty arthritis in the second distal interphalangeal joint.
   Initially, colchicine treatment was given along with NSAIDs, but
   symptoms failed to subside. After a persistent increase of swelling and
   pain, the surgical evacuation was sought to reduce the pain and exclude
   any other causes of arthritis. Histopathology report confirmed the
   presence of monosodium urate crystals without any signs of infection. In
   conclusion, surgical intervention of gouty arthritis can be beneficial
   in cases of persistent pain and increasing rate of swelling despite the
   medicinal trial, especially in unusual cases of gouty arthritis such as
   gout of the second metatarsophalangeal joint.}},

Abstract = {{The present study utilizes meta-analytic techniques to examine the
   literature on sleep and work performance. In line with previous
   meta-analytic research, results indicate that sleep and work performance
   have a positive relationship. However, more importantly, results from
   moderator analyses reveal that the type of sleep measurement (sleep
   quantity and sleep quality), work performance measurement (task
   performance, organizational citizenship behavior, and counterproductive
   work behavior), analysis method (between-person and within-person),
   sleep report source (self-report, other report, and objective), sleep
   recall window (day, week/month, and more than 1 month), and study
   setting (field and laboratory) differentially influence the strength of
   the sleep-work performance relationship. Furthermore, meta-analytic SEM
   results indicate that certain mediators (affect, job attitudes, and
   cognitive resources) provide stronger explanations (i.e., stronger
   indirect effects) for the relationship between sleep and work
   performance, depending on the specific type of performance being
   examined. In general, results highlight the importance of construct
   operationalization and methodology decisions when conducting sleep-work
   performance research and provide greater insight into explanations for
   the relationship between sleep and work performance. Research
   implications, practical implications, potential limitations, and future
   directions are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Controlling the carrier envelope phase (CEP) in mode-locked lasers over

   fast timescales and a feedback technique that addresses slowly varying
   sources of interference and locking bandwidth limitations associated
   with gain media with long upper-state lifetimes. We experimentally
   realize the hybrid stabilization system in an Er:Yb:glass mode-locked
   laser and demonstrate 75 hours of stabilization with integrated phase
   noise of 14 mrad (1 Hz to 3 MHz), corresponding to around 11 as of
   carrier to envelope jitter. Additionally, we examine the impact of
   environmental factors, such as humidity and pressure, on the long-term

Abstract = {{Aims We investigated the 2 year rate of ischaemic stroke/transient
   ischaemic attack (IS) in patients with heart failure (HF) who were in
   sinus rhythm (HF-SR) and aimed to develop a score for stratifying risk
   of IS in this population.
   Methods and results A total of 15 425 patients (mean age 71.5 years,
   39\% women) with HF-SR enrolled in the Swedish Heart Failure Register
   were included; 28 815 age-matched and sex-matched controls, without a
   registered diagnosis of HF, were selected from the Swedish Population
   Register. The 2 year rate of IS was 3.0\% in patients and 1.4\% in
   controls. In the patient group, a risk score including age (1p for 65-74
   years; 2p for 75-84 years; 3p for >= 85 years), previous IS (2p),
   ischaemic heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, kidney dysfunction, and
   New York Heart Association III/IV class (1p each) was generated. Over a
   mean follow-up of 20.1 (SD 7.5) months, the cumulative incidences (per
   1000 person-years) of IS in patients with score 0 to >= 7 were 2.2, 5.3,
   8.9, 13.2, 15.7, 20.4, 26.4, and 33.0, with hazard ratios for score 1 to
   >= 7 (with 0 as reference): 2.4, 4.1, 6.1, 7.2, 9.4, 12.2, and 15.3. The
   risk score performed modestly (area under the curve 63.7\%; P = 0.4711
   for lack of fit with a logistic model; P = 0.7062 with Poisson, scaled
   by deviance).
   Conclusions In terms of absolute risk, only 27.6\% of patients had an
   annual IS incidence of <= 1\%. To which extent this would be amenable to
   anticoagulant treatment remains conjectural. A score compiling age and
   specific co-morbidities identified HF-SR patients with increased risk of
   IS with modest discriminative ability.}},

Abstract = {{In the absence of an effective treatment to alter the progressive course
   of cognitive decline and dementia, identification of modifiable risk
   factors that could promote healthy cognitive aging has become a public
   health research priority. This study seeks to comprehensively determine
   the contemporaneous associations of a broad spectrum of time-varying
   modifiable lifestyle factors with age-related cognitive decline in a
   large population-based cohort of older adults. A total of 5,711 subjects
   aged 50 and older from the WHO Study on global AGEing and adult health
   (SAGE) in Shanghai were studied. Repeated measures of lifestyle factors
   and cognitive performance were conducted in 2009-2010 and 2014-2015.
   Linear random slope models were used to evaluate the contemporaneous
   associations between time-varying lifestyle factors and cognitive
   performance. Person-mean centering method was used to disaggregate the
   between- and within-person effects in the time-varying lifestyle factors
   in the random slope models. We found that higher vegetable and fruit
   consumption, as well as higher level of physical activity were
   positively associated with all cognitive domains. Body mass index (BMI)
   was negatively associated with all cognitive domains, whereas
   waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was negatively associated with verbal fluency
   score only. Sedentary time was negatively associated with digit span
   score but positively associated with verbal fluency score. The
   between-person effects seem to be more dominant than within-person
   effects. Overall, our findings suggest better management of multiple
   lifestyle factors may protect against cognitive decline in later life.
   Higher vegetable and fruit consumption and physical activity are
   protective, whereas obesity is detrimental to cognitive decline in older
   adults. This study underpins the development of multi-domain lifestyle
   recommendations to promote healthy cognitive aging.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To assess how beneficiary premiums, expected out-of-pocket
   costs, and plan finances in the Medicare Advantage (MA) market are
   related to coding intensity.
   Data Sources/Study Setting MA plan characteristics and administrative
   records from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for
   the sample of beneficiaries enrolled in both MA and Part D between 2008
   and 2015. Medicare claims and drug utilization data for Traditional
   Medicare (TM) beneficiaries were used to calibrate an independent
   measure of health risk.
   Study Design Coding intensity was measured by comparing the CMS risk
   score for each MA contract with a contract level risk score developed
   using prescription drug data. We conducted regressions of plan outcomes,
   estimating the relationship between outcomes and coding intensity. To
   develop prescription drug scores, we assigned therapeutic classes to
   beneficiaries based on their prescription drug utilization. We then
   regressed nondrug spending for TM beneficiaries in 2015 on demographic
   and therapeutic class identifiers for 2014 and used the coefficients to
   predict relative risk.
   Principal Findings We found that, for each \$1 increase in potential
   revenue resulting from coding intensity, MA plan bid submissions
   declined by \$0.10 to \$0.19, and another \$0.21 to \$0.45 went toward
   reducing plans' medical loss ratios, an indication of higher
   profitability. We found only a small impact on beneficiary's projected
   out-of-pocket costs in a plan, which serves as a measure of the
   generosity of plan benefits, and a \$0.11 to \$0.16 reduction in
   premiums. As expected, coding intensity's effect on bids was
   substantially larger in counties with higher levels of MA competition
   than in less competitive counties.
   Conclusions While coding intensity increases taxpayers' costs of the MA
   program, enrollees and plans both benefit but with larger gains for
   plans. The adoption of policies to more completely adjust for coding
   intensity would likely affect both beneficiaries and plan profits.}},

Abstract = {{Objective
   A roadway departure crash is one in which a vehicle crosses an edge
   line, a centerline, or otherwise leaves the traveled way. These crashes
   that involve run-off-road and cross-median/centerline head-on collisions
   tend to be more severe than other crash types. According to the NHTSA
   Fatality Analysis Reporting System database, a total of 7,833 people
   perished in crashes involving fixed roadside objects in 2017, accounting
   for 21 percent of the total number of fatalities in the United States.
   Several previous studies have reported that rural bridge-related crashes
   result in more fatalities due to their being mostly the fixed-object
   crash type. As such, further in-depth investigation of this type of
   crash is necessary. Due to the lack of a comprehensive database that
   includes bridge-related crashes and bridge characteristics, identifying
   the key factors contributing to this type of crash is a challenging task
   that is addressed in this paper.
   Method
   Study team gathered and compiled five years (2011-2015) of crash data
   from the New Jersey crash database and the characteristics of bridges
   from the Long-Term Bridge Performance portal. A Firth's
   penalized-likelihood logistic regression model was developed to examine
   the impact of explanatory variables on crash severity.
   Results
   Based on the five years (2011-2015) of crash data, significant factors
   (i.e., driver age, weather conditions, surface conditions, lighting
   conditions, speed limit, roadway characteristics, and direction of
   traffic) were identified that affect the severity of bridge-related
   crashes in Middlesex County, New Jersey.
   Conclusion
   This model is an appropriate tool for predicting the impact of all the
   confounding variables on the probability of bridge-related crashes while
   also considering the rareness of the event. Based on the obtained odds
   ratio, the various effects of the identified variables are discussed,
   and recommendations made regarding countermeasures policymakers can
   establish to reduce the number of these crashes in New Jersey.}},

Abstract = {{Severe bottlenecks significantly diminish the amount of genetic
   diversity and the speed at which it accumulates (i.e., evolutionary
   rate). They further compromise the efficiency of natural selection to
   eliminate deleterious variants, which may reach fixation in the
   surviving populations. Consequently, expanding and adapting to new
   environments may pose a significant challenge when strong bottlenecks
   result in genetic pauperization. Herein, we surveyed the patterns of
   nucleotide diversity, molecular adaptation and genetic load across 177
   gene-loci in a circum-Mediterranean conifer (Pinus pinea L.) that
   represents one of the most extreme cases of genetic pauperization in
   widespread outbreeding taxa. We found very little genetic variation in
   both hypervariable nuclear microsatellites (SSRs) and gene-loci, which
   translated into genetic diversity estimates one order of magnitude lower
   than those previously reported for pines. Such values were consistent
   with a strong population decline that began some similar to 1 Ma.
   Comparisons with the related and parapatric maritime pine (Pinus
   pinaster Ait.) revealed reduced rates of adaptive evolution (alpha and
   omega(a)) and a significant accumulation of genetic load. It is unlikely
   that these are the result from differences in mutation rate or linkage
   disequilibrium between the two species; instead they are the presumable
   outcome of contrasting demographic histories affecting both the speed at
   which these taxa accumulate genetic diversity, and the global efficacy
   of selection. Future studies, and programs for conservation and
   management, should thus start testing for the effects of genetic load on
   fitness, and integrating such effects into predictive models.}},

Title = {{A novel mutation in the SLCO2A1 gene, encoding a prostaglandin

Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{Chronic enteropathy associated with SLCO2A1 gene (CEAS) is caused by
   loss-of-function mutations in SLCO2A1, which encodes a prostaglandin
   (PG) transporter. In this study, we report a sibling case of CEAS with a
   novel pathogenic variant of the SLCO2A1 gene. Compound heterozygous
   variants in SLCO2A1 were identified in an 8-year-old boy and 12-year-old
   girl, and multiple chronic nonspecific ulcers were observed in the
   patients using capsule endoscopy. The splice site mutation (c.940 +
   1G>A) of the paternal allele was previously reported to be pathogenic,
   whereas the missense variant (c.1688T>C) of the maternal allele was
   novel and had not yet been reported. The affected residue (p.Leu563Pro)
   is located in the 11th transmembrane domain (helix 11) of SLCO2A1.
   Because SLCO2A1 mediates the uptake and clearance of PGs, the urinary PG
   metabolites were measured by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem
   mass spectrometry. The urinary tetranor-prostaglandin E metabolite
   levels in the patients were significantly higher than those in
   unaffected individuals. We established cell lines with
   doxycycline-inducible expression of wild type SLCO2A1 (WT-SLCO2A1) and
   the L563P mutant. Immunofluorescence staining showed that WT-SLCO2A1 and
   the L563P mutant were dominantly expressed on the plasma membranes of
   these cells. Cells expressing WT-SLCO2A1 exhibited time- and
   dose-dependent uptake of PGE(2), while the mutant did not show any
   uptake activity. Residue L563 is very close to the putative
   substrate-binding site in SLCO2A1, R561 in helix 11. However, in a
   molecular model of SLCO2A1, the side chain of L563 projected outside of
   helix 11, indicating that L563 is likely not directly involved in
   substrate binding. Instead, the substitution of Pro may twist the helix
   and impair the transporter function. In summary, we identified a novel
   pathogenic variant of SLCO2A1 that caused loss-of-function and induced
   CEAS.}},

Abstract = {{Background and purpose - Enhanced recovery programs have reduced length
   of stay (LOS) after hip and knee arthroplasty (THA/TKA). Although risk
   factors disposing to prolonged LOS are well documented, there is limited
   information on the role of weekday of surgery. This study analyzed the
   role of weekday of surgery and other potential risk factors for LOS > 2
   days.
   Patients and methods - We included 10,576 unselected consecutive
   procedures between January 2016 and August 2017 within a multicenter
   fast-track THA/TKA collaboration with prospective collection of
   preoperative characteristics. We used multiple regression analysis of
   potential risk factors for LOS > 2 days followed by construction of a
   simple risk score from 0 to 15 points based on the calculated odds
   ratios.
   Results - Mean LOS was 1.9 (SD 1.8) days, with 80\% of patients having
   surgery from Monday to Wednesday. Of these, 17\% (95\% CI 16-18) had a
   LOS > 2 days vs. 19\% (CI 17-21) in those operated on Thursday and
   Friday. Patients were scheduled evenly throughout the week regardless of
   risk of LOS > 2 days and despite the fact that 38\% (CI 35-40) of
   patients with >= 6 points (16\% of the total population) had a LOS > 2
   days compared with 14\% (CI 13-14) in those with < 6 points. In these
   ``high-risk{''} patients, the fraction with LOS > 2 days increased when
   having surgery on Thursdays or Fridays (43\% CI 38-49) compared with
   Monday to Wednesday (37\% CI 34-39).
   Interpretation - A detailed preoperative risk assessment may be helpful
   to plan the weekday of surgery in order to decrease LOS and weekend
   hospitalization.}},

Abstract = {{Directed evolution of Cp{*}Rh-III-linked nitrobindin (NB), a biohybrid
   catalyst, was performed based on an in vitro screening approach. A key
   aspect of this effort was the establishment of a high-throughput
   screening (HTS) platform that involves an affinity purification step
   employing a starch-agarose resin for a maltose binding protein (MBP)
   tag. The HTS platform enables efficient preparation of the purified
   MBP-tagged biohybrid catalysts in a 96-well format and eliminates
   background influence of the host E. coli cells. Three rounds of directed
   evolution and screening of more than 4000 clones yielded a
   Cp{*}Rh-III-linked NB(T98H/L100K/K127E) variant with a 4.9-fold enhanced
   activity for the cycloaddition of acetophenone oximes with alkynes. It
   is confirmed that this HTS platform for directed evolution provides an
   efficient strategy for generating highly active biohybrid catalysts
   incorporating a synthetic metal cofactor.}},

Abstract = {{Although the importance of meaning-making among suicide bereaved has
   been reported, the detailed contents of the process remain unclear. This
   study aimed to identify the content categories of sense-making and

Abstract = {{Changing weather patterns affect the incidence of respiratory tract
   infections, which causes huge economic burden for healthcare services.
   Early warning for the infection may help healthcare service providers to
   prepare for an epidemic on time. The purpose of the current research is
   to explore the relationship between respiratory tract infection episodes
   and climatic factors and to predict the number of daily episodes in
   different weather zones of active weather stations in Bangladesh.
   Prescription data collected from clinics are integrated with climatic
   factors of the nearest weather stations, and the integrated dataset is
   used to predict the daily respiratory tract infection episodes. We apply
   panel generalized linear models and show that the number of episodes
   increases to a greater extent for increasing magnitude of rolling
   standard deviation of relative humidity and rolling mean of wind speed.
   A 7-day-ahead forecast of number of episodes based on rolling window
   models of regression tree, random forest, support vector regression, and
   deep neural network is estimated to know the severity of epidemic for
   healthcare planning. A further 1-day-ahead confirmation forecast is
   produced to assess the necessity of healthcare service plan adopted
   based on a 7-day-ahead forecast. Root mean squared forecast errors
   computed for both 7-day-ahead and 1-day-ahead forecasts from these
   models provide qualitatively similar results, except for three weather
   stations where an unusually high number of episodes are observed because
   of extreme climate and high level of air pollution.}},

Abstract = {{Among the 146 patients enrolled in the Korean FH registry, 83 patients
   who had undergone appropriate LLT escalation and were followed-up for >=
   6 months were analyzed for pathogenic variants (PVs). The achieved
   percentage of expected low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C)
   reduction (primary variable) and achievement rates of LDL-C<70 mg/dL
   were assessed. The correlations between the treatment response and the
   characteristics of PVs, and the weighted 4 SNP-based score were
   evaluated. The primary variables were significantly lower in the
   PV-positive patients than in the PV-negative patients (p=0.007).
   However, the type of PV did not significantly correlate with the primary
   variable. The achievement rates of LDL-C<70 mg/dL was very low,
   regardless of the PV characteristics. Patients with a higher 4-SNP score
   showed a lower primary variable (R-2=0.045, p=0.048). Among evolocumab
   users, PV-negative patients or those with only defective PVs revealed
   higher primary variable, whereas patients with at least one null PV
   showed lower primary variables. The adjusted response of patients with
   FH to LLT showed significant associations with PV positivity and 4-SNP
   score. These results may be helpful in managing FH patients with diverse
   genetic backgrounds.}},

Title = {{Rehabilitation professional and user evaluation of an integrated
   push-pull lever drive system for wheelchair mobility}},
Journal = {{ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Wheeled mobility devices enable persons with limited mobility to
   maintain an independent lifestyle. Lever-drive propulsion options have
   been shown to increase wheeled mobility device efficiency while reducing
   physical strain on users. Despite these benefits, they have not been
   widely adopted for everyday use. Two novel lever-drive devices
   (RoScooter and RoTrike) provide an alternative to pushrim propulsion by
   using an integrated front-and-center push-pull lever mechanism. The
   objectives of this study were to assess the usability and performance of
   the lever-drive devices using both rehabilitation professional and user
   feedback. The study enrolled 17 rehabilitation professionals and 13
   users who performed various mobility tasks to rate the performance of
   the RoScooter and RoTrike for ease of use, stability, safety,
   appearance, and comfort. Users were graded on their performance using a
   scoring system based on the Wheelchair Skills Test. Rehabilitation
   professionals suggested improvements in regard to adjustability,
   maneuverability, target population, and appearance, preferring the
   operations of the RoScooter to the RoTrike. Users reported that the
   devices were entertaining and easy to use, but improvements in
   adjustability, reversal methods, and operation options to appeal to a
   wider range of consumers are needed before lever-drive devices are
   suitable to replace or supplement current wheeled mobility devices.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose This study aims to clarify the association between cervical
   spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) and cervical arteriosclerosis using
   ultrasonography that comprehensively includes spinal cord stenosis.
   Methods Eighty-two consecutive patients aged over 60 years who underwent
   spine surgery were divided into those with CSM (n = 31; CSM group) and
   those with lumbar spinal stenosis without cervical myelopathy (n = 51;
   LSS group). Maximum spinal cord compression (MSCC) was evaluated for
   cervical stenosis severity using magnetic resonance (MR) images. The
   intima-media thickness (IMT) of the common carotid artery (CCA) and
   pulsatility index (PI) of the bilateral internal carotid artery (ICA)
   and vertebral artery (VA) were evaluated for cervical arteriosclerosis
   using pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasonography. Symptom severity was
   evaluated using the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score.
   Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to determine the
   relationship between the JOA score and MSCC or IMT and PI in each group.
   Stepwise multiple linear regression analyses were conducted with the JOA
   score as a dependent variable and age, sex, body mass index, cervical
   arteriosclerosis assessment, and MSCC as independent variables. Results
   Bilateral IMT and left-side ICA-PI were significantly negatively
   correlated with JOA scores in the CSM group (Right-CCA-IMT: R = - 0.412,
   Left-IMT: R = - 0.549, Left-ICA -PI: R = - 0.205, P < 0.05), but not in
   the LSS group. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that CCA-IMT
   was the strongest independent factor associated with the preoperative
   JOA score. Conclusions Cervical arteriosclerosis was associated with
   preoperative clinical symptoms in CSM patients.}},

Journal = {{NUMERICAL METHODS FOR PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, a new mathematical model of distributed order
   reaction-diffusion equation having space-time non-singular fractional
   derivative with Mittag-Leffler kernel is being considered. We use a new
   numerical technique in combination of Mittag-Leffler kernel operational
   matrix of fractional differentiation and Legendre spectral collocation
   method to deal with such type of problem. The approximate expression of
   non-singular fractional differentiation of a simple polynomial function
   t(k) is derived with the help of definition of Mittag-Leffler fractional
   derivative. An operational matrix of fractional differentiation is
   derived with the help of above approximate expression and Simpson 1/3
   numerical integration scheme. Now, this newly derived operational matrix
   is implemented in order to find out the numerical solution of
   distributed order diffusion equation model. We have used spectral method
   to deal this type of model with distributed term. We pick up particular
   cases of model to show the accuracy of our proposed method. The error
   tables and 3D plot of exact and numerical solution clearly depict the
   accuracy and feasibility of this method. The dynamics of u(x, t) is
   presented through graphs with different fractional order in both space

Abstract = {{Carbohydrates, along with proteins and peptides, are known to represent
   a major class of biomacromolecules involved in calcium carbonate
   biomineralization. However, in spite of multiple physical and
   biochemical characterizations, the explicit role of saccharide
   macromolecules (long chains of carbohydrate molecules) in mineral
   deposition is not yet understood. In this study, we investigated the
   influence of two common acidic monosaccharides (MSs), the two simplest
   forms of acidic carbohydrates, namely glucuronic and galacturonic acids,
   on the formation of calcite crystals in vitro. We show here that the
   size, morphology, and microstructure of calcite crystals are altered
   when they are grown in the presence of these MSs. More importantly,
   these MSs were found to become incorporated into the calcite crystalline
   lattice and induce anisotropic lattice distortions, a phenomenon widely
   studied for other biomolecules related to CaCO3 biomineralization, but
   never before reported in the case of single MSs. Changes in the calcite
   lattice induced by MSs incorporation were precisely determined by
   high-resolution synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction. We believe that
   the results of this research may deepen our understanding of the
   interaction of saccharide polymers with an inorganic host and shed light
   on the implications of carbohydrates for biomineralization processes.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown that Salmonella shedding status affects sows'
   microbiota during gestation and that these modifications are reflected
   in the faecal microbiota of their piglets at weaning. The aims of this
   study were: (a) to evaluate the persistence, up to the fattening period,
   of the previously measured link between the microbiota of piglets and
   their mothers' Salmonella shedding status; and (b) measure the impact of
   the measured microbiota variations on their Salmonella excretion at this
   stage. To achieve this, 76 piglets born from 19 sows for which the
   faecal microbiota was previously documented, were selected in a
   multisite production system. The faecal matter of these swine was
   sampled after 4 weeks, at the fattening stage. The Salmonella shedding
   status and faecal microbiota of these animals were described using
   bacteriological and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing respectively. The
   piglet digestive microbiota association with the Salmonella shedding
   status of their sows did not persist after weaning and did not affect
   the risk of Salmonella excretion during fattening, while the birth
   mother still affected the microbiota of the swine at fattening. This
   supports the interest in sows as a target for potentially transferrable
   microbiota modifications.}},

Journal = {{SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{154}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{35-60}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This research sets out to determine the nexus among economic complexity
   (ECI; which reflects a country's productivity), income inequality, and
   country risk and whether country risk affects the complexity-inequality
   nexus. By applying balanced panel data of 43 countries from 1991 to 2016
   to a data-driven econometric methodology-finite mixture model, we
   provide fresh insight into this relationship from the perspective of
   country risk. The results indicate that the two-group finite mixture
   model is able to best fit our data, and that increasing economic
   complexity has no impact on income inequality in group A, whereas
   improving the structure of productivity mitigates the income gap in
   group B. Furthermore, country risk and the subcomponents of the former
   (i.e., economic risk, financial risk, and political risk) all exert
   effects on the complexity-inequality nexus. Specifically speaking, an
   increase in ECI is associated with more equal income distribution in a
   country with low country risk, while the improvement in productive
   structure cannot improve an unequal income distribution in countries
   under high country risk. Finally, it is noteworthy that the finite
   mixture model also captures information about the transformation of this
   nexus, with evidence demonstrating that 5 countries experience a
   variation in their complexity-inequality relationship over the sample
   period.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most consistent findings in the depression literature is that
   stressful life events predict the onset and course of depressive
   episodes. Cognitive and biological responses to life stressors have both
   been identified, albeit largely independently, as central to
   understanding the association between stress and depression. I maintain
   that the largest advances in the understanding of depression will come
   from examining the ways that cognitive and biological responses to
   stressors reciprocally influence one another and, in doing so,
   contribute to the onset and maintenance of depression. I summarize the
   cognitive and biological stress responses implicated in depression and
   then describe the reciprocal ways that they are associated with each
   other. Finally, I discuss the broader implications of taking this
   integrated approach and suggest directions and considerations for future
   research.}},

Abstract = {{As a weak tricarboxylic acid, citric acid (CA) has been proposed for the
   preparation of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) due to its innocuous and
   easily recyclable nature. However, the yield of the obtained CNCs is
   normally below 30\% by CA hydrolysis due to the weak acidity of CA. In
   this work, FeCl3 was discovered as a powerful catalyst to enhance the CA
   hydrolysis efficiency for the green and highly efficient preparation of
   carboxylic and thermostable CNCs. The maximum yield of 80.28\% could be
   achieved via FeCl3-catalyzed CA hydrolysis under the optimal condition
   of 85 wt \% CA aqueous solution and 0.02 mmol FeCl3/g CA at 80 degrees C
   for 6 h hydrolysis. It was found that the as-prepared CNCs (6-12 nm in
   diameter, 100-250 nm in length) showed a maximum crystallinity index of
   around 80\% and high thermal stability (T-max is around 355 degrees C).
   Also, the obtained CNCs functionalized with carboxylic groups exhibited
   superior dispersibility in an aqueous medium. In addition, both the CA
   and FeCl3 could be easily recovered after hydrolysis, and the collected
   sugars after hydrolysis can be used as precursors for producing platform
   chemicals such as lactic acid and furfural. Therefor; this study
   presents a green and sustainable approach for the highly efficient
   production of carboxylic CNCs with great dispersibility and high thermal
   stability. The obtained functional CNCs may find applications in a
   variety of high-tech fields.}},

   types of pneumonia was higher amongst males (CAP: incidence rate ratio
   {[}IRR] 1.05, 95\% CI 1.03-1.06; VAP: IRR 1.36, 95\% CI 1.26-1.46; and
   NV-HAP: IRR 1.16, 95\% CI 1.14-1.18). The crude in-hospital mortality
   (IHM) rate for CAP was 11.44\% in females and 11.80\% in males (P =
   .005); for VAP IHM, the rate was approximately 35\% in patients of both
   genders and for NV-HAP IHM, the rate was 23.97\% for females and 26.40\%
   for males (P < .001). After multivariable adjustment, in patients of
   both genders, older age and comorbidities were factors associated with
   IHM in the three types of pneumonia analysed. Female gender was a risk
   factor for IHM after VAP (OR 1.24; 95\% CI 1.06-1.44), and no gender
   differences were found for CAP or NV-HAP.
   Conclusions Our findings show a difference between females and males,
   with females presenting a lower incidence of all types of pneumonia.
   However, female gender was a risk factor for IHM after VAP.}},

Volume = {{67}},

Abstract = {{Combined applications of plant residues and nitrogen (N) fertilizer in
   agroecosystems may increase N immobilization and reduce N loss through
   microbial propagation using fresh organic matter (FOM). However, the
   effects of different carbon (C) availabilities in FOM to microbes on the
   immobilization of two forms of fertilizer-N (NH4+-N and NO3--N) are
   still not clear. In this study, starch (high availability) and cellulose
   (low availability) were used to represent different polysaccharides in
   crop residues, and their effects on the immobilization of two forms of
   fertilizer-N (NH4+-N and NO3--N) were investigated. Following the
   additions of polysaccharides and N-15 (99.9 atom \%) (2.1 g C kg(-1)
   soil and 100 mg N kg(-1) soil), we measured soil respiration and traced
   immobilized fertilizer-N over 48 days. The starch addition quickly
   depleted mineral N (on day 3) while cellulose caused a slow but
   continuous immobilization for 4 weeks. Despite the same amount of C and
   N input, the maximum fertilizer-N immobilization in the cellulose
   treatment was lower than in the starch treatment and accounted for 56\%
   and 40\% of added N for NH4+-N and NO3--N forms, respectively. NH4+-N
   was preferentially immobilized over NO3--N in the cellulose treatment
   during incubation, but it also occurred in the starch treatment when
   mineral N was sufficient. Our results suggest that it was not the
   abundance of C, but rather the availability of C to microbes, that
   strongly determined the rate and capacity of fertilizer-N
   immobilization. Further, the preferential immobilization of NH4+-N
   highlighted that the use of ammonium-based fertilizer can increase the
   level of fertilizer-N immobilization.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL) feeding on the methane
   (CH4) emission and the ruminal microbiome of Lai Sind beef cattle were
   investigated. Changes in the methane production and rumen microbiome by
   CNSL feeding were monitored by a respiration chamber and 16S rRNA gene
   amplicon sequencing respectively. The results demonstrated that CNSL
   feeding mitigated 20.2\%-23.4\% of the CH4 emission in vivo without
   apparent adverse effects on feed intake and feed digestibility. The
   rumen fluid analysis revealed a significant increase in the proportion
   of propionate in the total short-chain fatty acids. The relative
   abundance of methanogen (order Methanobacteriales) decreased
   significantly, indicating the direct inhibitory effect of CNSL on
   methanogens. The predicted function of the rumen microbiome indicated
   that carbohydrate and lipid metabolisms including propionate production
   were upregulated by CNSL feeding, whereas CH4 metabolism was
   downregulated. A network analysis revealed that methanogen changed its
   partner bacteria after CNSL feeding. The delta C-13 of CH4 ranged from
   -74.2 parts per thousand to -66.6 parts per thousand with significant
   fluctuation by CNSL feeding, in agreement with the shift of the rumen
   microbiome. Our findings demonstrate that CNSL feeding can mitigate the
   CH4 emission from local cattle production systems in South-East Asia by
   modifying the rumen microbiome and its function.}},

Journal = {{GUT MICROBES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common complication in kidney
   transplant recipients and can lead to significant morbidity and
   mortality. Recent evidence supports a role for the gut as a source for
   UTIs but little is known about the relationship between gut commensal
   bacteria and UTI development. We hypothesized that the abundance of gut
   commensal bacteria is associated with a lower risk of developing
   bacteriuria and UTIs. We performed gut microbiome profiling using 16S
   rRNA gene sequencing of the V4-V5 hypervariable region on 510 fecal
   specimens in 168 kidney transplant recipients. Fifty-one kidney
   transplant recipients (30\%) developedEnterobacteriaceaebacteriuria
   within the first 6 months after transplantation
   (EnterobacteriaceaeBacteriuria Group) and 117 did not
   (NoEnterobacteriaceaeBacteriuria Group). The relative abundances
   ofFaecalibacteriumandRomboutsiawere significantly higher in the fecal
   specimens from the NoEnterobacteriaceaeBacteriuria Group than those from
   theEnterobacteriaceaeBacteriuria Group (AdjustedPvalue<.01). The
   combined relative abundance ofFaecalibacteriumandRomboutsiawas inversely
   correlated with the relative abundance ofEnterobacteriaceae(r = -0.13,P=
   .003). In a multivariable Cox Regression, a top tercile cutoff of the
   combined relative abundance ofFaecalibacteriumandRomboutsiaof >= 13.7\%
   was independently associated with a decreased risk
   forEnterobacteriaceaebacteriuria (hazard ratio 0.3,P= .02)
   andEnterobacteriaceaeUTI (hazard ratio 0.4,P= .09). In conclusion, we
   identify bacterial taxa associated with decreased risk
   forEnterobacteriaceaebacteriuria andEnterobacteriaceaeUTI in kidney
   transplant recipients, which supports future studies on modulating the
   gut microbiota as a novel treatment for preventing UTIs.}},

Abstract = {{Frequency decomposer or filter bank plays acritical role in the design
   of digital hearing aid systems.This paper proposes filter bank
   structures suitable for the design of optimal hearing aid systems.The
   performance indices such as complexity, power dissipation, area
   utilization, delay, matching error of the filter banks are very
   competitive when compared to the designs in literature.Constrained least
   square finite impulse response filter with smooth transition band
   characteristics is used in the first method.The second method is based
   on Minimum phase filters with reduced number of coefficients which
   exhibit the smallest passband group delay in the family of filters with
   the same magnitude response characteristics.Hardware complexity is
   reduced very much since there is significant reduction in
   multiplications per sample in both the methods.Full cycle responses of
   individual filters are considered for calculation of overall response of
   the filter bank.Coefficient decimation method is used in the
   reconfigurable structure to enable the filter banks to adapt variation
   in audiogram pattern during the course of time.Synthesis results by
   Cadence Encounter(R.) R.T.L. Compiler software also justify the
   theoretical claims}},

Abstract = {{The general theory of dark solitons relies on repulsive interactions
   and, therefore, predicts the impossibility to form dark-soliton bound

   bound solitons in nonlocal nonlinear media. Here, we report that
   exciton-polariton superfluids can also sustain dark-soliton molecules,
   although the interactions are fully local. With a novel all-optical
   technique, we create two dark solitons that bind together to form an
   unconventional dark-soliton molecule. We demonstrate that the stability
   of this structure and the separation distance between two dark solitons
   is tightly connected to the driven-dissipative nature of the polariton
   fluid.}},

Title = {{Muscle contributions to maximal single-leg forward braking and backward
   acceleration in elite athletes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{112}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{Abrupt deceleration is a common practice in several sports, where sudden
   changes of direction are needed to reach the highest performance level.
   When inappropriately performed, these actions can impose excessive
   mechanical loads at the lower limb joints, specifically at the knee and
   ankle joints, usually associated with increased risk of injury. This
   work aims to estimate muscle forces and muscle contributions to the
   acceleration of the center of mass during a rapid maximal single-leg
   forward braking and backward acceleration task. Fourteen elite male
   injury-free indoor-sports athletes participated in this work. Scaled
   generic musculoskeletal models, consisting of 12 segments, 23 degrees of
   freedom, and 92 muscle-tendon actuators were used in OpenSim software.
   Due to the nature of the musculoskeletal system, all muscles are
   considered when joint and segment positions, velocities, and
   accelerations are calculated, resulting in muscles acting to accelerate
   joints it does not span. The knowledge of muscle interaction during this
   multijoint task is important and was achieved through an induced
   acceleration analysis. The vasti (-9.18 +/- 2.09 and -7.63 +/- 1.33
   N/Kg) were the main contributors to the centre of mass deceleration
   profile along the anterior/posterior direction, aided by the soleus
   muscle (9.72 +/- 2.35 and 9. 62 +/- 2.07 N/Kg), which counteracted most
   of the effects applied by gravity along the vertical direction, during
   both phases. This study provides a computational approach to quantify
   the dynamical interactions between muscles and joints during an abrupt
   anterior/posterior deceleration task, thus giving robust and insightful
   indicators that can be implemented in injury prevention protocols. (C)

Abstract = {{A number of oocyte characteristics have been associated with
   fertilization, implantation and live-birth rates, albeit without
   reaching a consensus. This study aims to delineate possible associations
   between oocyte characteristics, oocyte behavior during intracytoplasmic
   sperm injection (ICSI), fertilization potential, and laboratory
   outcomes. Four-hundred and seventy-seven patients, yielding 3452
   oocytes, were enrolled in this prospective observational study from 2015
   to 2018. Omicron oplasm granularity was associated with poor embryo
   quality and higher probabilities of post-ICSI oocytes and embryos
   discarded in any developmental stage and never selected for embryo
   transfer or cryopreservation (p<0.001). Both sudden or difficult ooplasm
   aspiration, and high or lack of resistance during ICSI were associated
   with either a poor Zygote-Score or fertilization failure (p<0.001).
   Sudden or difficult ooplasm aspiration and high resistance during ICSI
   penetration were positively associated with resulting to a post-ICSI
   oocyte or embryo that would be selected for discard. Evaluation of
   oocyte characteristics and oocyte behavior during ICSI may provide early
   information regarding laboratory and cycle outcomes. Particularly,
   ooplasm granularity, and fragmentation of polar body, along with sudden
   or difficult ooplasm aspiration and high or lack of resistance during
   ICSI penetration may hinder the outcome of an ICSI cycle. The
   associations presented herein may contribute towards development of a
   grading system or a prediction model. Taking into account information on
   oocytes and ICSI behavior may effectively assist in enhancing IVF
   outcome rates.}},

Abstract = {{Building electricity is a major component of global energy use and its
   environmental impacts. Detailed data on residential electricity use have
   many interrelated research applications, from energy conservation to
   non-intrusive load monitoring, energy storage, integration of

   here, Multifamily Residential Electricity Dataset (MFRED), contains the
   electricity use of 390 apartments, ranging from studios to four-bedroom
   units. All apartments are located in the Northeastern United States
   (IECC-climate-zone 4A), but differ in their heating/cooling system and
   construction year (early to late 20(th) century). To adhere to privacy
   guidelines, data were averaged across 15 apartments each, based on
   annual electricity use. MFRED includes real and reactive power, at
   10-second resolution, for January to December 2019 (246 million data
   points). The annual average real power per apartment is 343W (3.27W/m(2)
   of floor area), with strong variation between seasons and apartment
   size. Considering its large number of apartments, high time resolution,
   real and reactive power, and 12-month duration, MFRED is currently

Abstract = {{As the novel coronavirus disease sweeps across the world, there is
   growing speculation on the role that atmospheric factors may have played
   on the different distribution of SARS-CoV-2, and on the epidemiological
   characteristics of COVID-19. Knowing the role that environmental factors
   play in influenza virus outbreaks, environmental pollution and, in
   particular, atmospheric airborne (particulate matter, PM) has been
   considered as a potential key factor in the spread and mortality of
   COVID-19. A possible role of the PM as the virus carrier has also been
   debated. The role of PM in exacerbating respiratory and cardiovascular
   disease has been well recognized. Accumulating evidence support the
   hypothesis that PM can trigger inflammatory response at molecular,
   cellular and organ levels. On this basis, we developed the hypothesis
   that PM may play a role as a booster of COVID-19 rather than as a
   carrier of SARS-CoV-2. To support our hypothesis, we analyzed the
   molecular signatures detected in cells exposed to PM samples collected
   in one of the most affected areas by the COVID-19 outbreak, in Italy.
   T47D human breast adenocarcinoma cells were chosen to explore the global
   gene expression changes induced by the treatment with organic extracts
   of PM 2.5. The analysis of the KEGG's pathways showed modulation of
   several gene networks related to the leucocyte transendothelial
   migration, cytoskeleton and adhesion system. Three major biological
   process were identified, including coagulation, growth control and
   immune response. The analysis of the modulated genes gave evidence for
   the involvement of PM in the endothelial disease, coagulation disorders,
   diabetes and reproductive toxicity, supporting the hypothesis that PM,
   directly or through molecular interplay, affects the same molecular
   targets as so far known for SARS-COV-2, contributing to the cytokines
   storm and to the aggravation of the symptoms triggered by COVID-19. We
   provide evidence for a plausible cooperation of receptors and
   transmembrane proteins, targeted by PM and involved in COVID-19,
   together with new insights into the molecular interplay of chemicals and
   pathogens that could be of importance for sustaining public health
   policies and developing new therapeutic approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Background The purpose of this study was to assess variability in cell
   composition and cell-specific gene expression in the skin of patients
   with localized scleroderma (LS) utilizing CryoStor (R) CS10 in
   comparison to RPMI to produce adequate preservation of tissue samples
   and cell types of interest for use in large-scale multi-institutional
   collaborations studying localized scleroderma and other skin disorders.
   Methods We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on paired skin biopsy
   specimens from 3 patients with LS. Each patient with one sample
   cryopreserved in CryoStor (R) CS10 and one fresh in RPMI media using 10x
   Genomics sequencing. Results Levels of cell viability and yield were
   comparable between CryoStor (R) CS10 (frozen) and RPMI (fresh) preserved
   cells. Furthermore, gene expression between preservation methods was
   collectively significantly correlated and conserved across all 18
   identified cell cluster populations. Conclusion Comparable cell
   population and transcript expression yields between CryoStor (R) CS10
   and RPMI preserved cells support the utilization of cryopreserved skin
   tissue in single-cell analysis. This suggests that employing
   standardized cryopreservation protocols for the skin tissue will help
   facilitate multi-site collaborations looking to identify mechanisms of
   disease in disorders characterized by cutaneous pathology.}},

   Splitting}},
Journal = {{SMALL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{48}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Direct water splitting over photocatalysts is a prospective strategy to
   convert solar energy into hydrogen energy. Nevertheless, because of the
   undesirable electron accumulation at the surface, the overall
   water-splitting efficiency is seriously restricted by the poor charge
   separation/transfer ability. Here, an all-organic donor-acceptor (D-A)
   system through crafting carbon rings units-conjugated tubular graphitic
   carbon nitride (C-TCN) is proposed. Through a range of characterizations
   and theoretical calculations, the incorporation of carbon rings units
   via continuous pi-conjugated bond builds a D-A system, which can drive
   intramolecular charge transfer to realize highly efficient charge
   separation. More importantly, the tubular structure and the incorporated
   carbon rings units cause a significant downshift of the valence band, of
   which the potential is beneficial to the activation for O-2 evolution.
   When serving as photocatalyst for overall water splitting, C-TCN
   displays considerable performance with H-2 and O-2 production rates of
   204.6 and 100.8 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), respectively. The corresponding
   external quantum efficiency reaches 2.6\% at 405 nm, and still remains
   1.7\% at 420 nm. This work demonstrates that the all-organic D-A system
   conceptualized from organic solar cell can offer promotional effect for
   overall water splitting by addressing the charge accumulation problem
   rooted in the hydrogen evolution reaction.}},

Abstract = {{Three new species of the genus Longior Travassos \& Kloss, 1958 are
   described and illustrated, namely L. surieli n. sp. in Antillanax
   dominicanus (Doesburg, 1953) from the Dominican Republic, L. lamothei n.
   sp. in Passalus punctiger Le Peletier \& Serville, 1825 from Mexico and
   Colombia and L. zumpimito n. sp. in P. punctatostriatus Percheron, 1835
   from Mexico. These constitute the first records of the genus Longior for
   the aforementioned countries, rising to nine species in the genus. The
   new species can be differentiated mainly by the length of their body,
   oesophagus and tail in both sexes, the extension of the lateral alae in
   the females and the morphology of the cephalic and posterior end in the
   males. The molecular phylogeny of the new taxa is inferred by the 28S
   and 18S rDNA and they form a monophyletic Glade with other Longior
   species. The phylogeny of Longior and that of their passalid hosts
   reveal coevolutionary relationships. These patterns suggest that the
   phylogeny of Longior species is probably strongly influenced by the
   evolutionary trajectories of their passalid hosts.}},

Abstract = {{Although mixture of LEDs is being considered as a simulator of the CIE
   daylight series, the performance of the simulations is highly dependent
   on the SPD of the selected LEDs. An algorithm for selection of the best
   LEDs for simulation of the CIE daylight series is helpful in this
   regard. To address this problem, using 200 imaginary light primaries and
   40 real LEDs, three algorithms based on concepts of equally spacing of
   wavelength range ({''}Equal{''}), Gram Schmidt orthogonalization in
   LEDs/light primaries spectral subspace ({''}Gram{''}) and the
   generalization of Gram Schmidt orthogonalization in the LEDs/light
   primaries projections onto the illuminants subspace ({''}Ortho{''}) were
   proposed and studied. Algorithms, in simulation and reality, were
   implemented for the CIE standard illuminants of D50, D55, D65 and D75, C
   and A. The results showed that the performance of the proposed
   algorithms generally increase with the higher number of selected
   LEDs/light primaries, while for the LEDs ``Gram{''} and ``Ortho{''}
   methods showed superior performance, simulations on the imaginary light
   primaries showed ``Ortho{''} could be considered as the best algorithm.

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, I build a two-agent New Keynesian model in which
   households with subjective and objective beliefs about capital gains
   from stock prices exist. The former type of households constructs their
   beliefs about expected capital gains by Bayesian learning from observed
   growth rates of stock prices. In a homogenous agent model with only
   subjective beliefs, the effect of the interest rate on stock prices
   tends to be unrealistically strong. I show how the presence of
   heterogeneity improves second moments of stock prices with realistic
   moments of business cycle properties. This quantitative improvement in
   stock price behaviors allows me to conduct a realistic analysis of how
   the stance of monetary policy affects stock price volatilities. Strong
   inertia of monetary policy provides the stability of stock prices. This
   is because the near-term real interest rate has dominant effects on
   stock prices under the presence of subjective beliefs since the presence
   limits the forward-looking nature in pricing stocks. However, because
   output depends on the expected path of the real interest rate in the
   forward-looking manner, strong monetary policy inertia does not
   necessarily provide stabilities of stock prices and output at the same
   time.}},

Abstract = {{The ideal laser source for nonlinear terahertz spectroscopy offers large
   versatility delivering both ultra-intense broadband single-cycle pulses
   and user-selectable multi-cycle pulses at narrow linewidths. Here we
   show a highly versatile terahertz laser platform providing single-cycle
   transients with tens of MV/cm peak field as well as spectrally narrow
   pulses, tunable in bandwidth and central frequency across 5 octaves at
   several MV/em field strengths. The compact scheme is based on optical
   rectification in organic crystals of a temporally modulated laser beam.
   It allows up to 50 cycles and central frequency tunable from 0.5 to 7
   terahertz, with a minimum width of 30 GHz, corresponding to the
   photon-energy width of Delta E=0.13 meV and the spectroscopic-wavenumber
   width of Delta(lambda(-1))=1.1 cm(-1). The experimental results are
   excellently predicted by theoretical modelling. Our table-top source
   shows similar performances to that of large-scale terahertz facilities
   but offering in addition more versatility, multi-colour femtosecond
   pump-probe opportunities and ultralow timing jitter. (C) 2020 Optical

Abstract = {{It has long been observed that human protein-coding genes have a
   particular distribution of GC-content: the 5 ` end of these genes has
   high GC-content while the 3 ` end has low GC-content. In 2012, it was
   proposed that this pattern of GC-content could act as an mRNA identity
   feature that would lead to it being better recognized by the cellular
   machinery to promote its nuclear export. In contrast, junk RNA, which
   largely lacks this feature, would be retained in the nucleus and
   targeted for decay. Now two recent papers have provided evidence that
   GC-content does promote the nuclear export of many mRNAs in human cells.}},

   adult isiZulu speakers}},
Journal = {{SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{67}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: This study continued the development of an isiZulu speech
   reception threshold (zSRT) test for use with first language, adult
   speakers of isiZulu.
   Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine the convergent
   and concurrent validity of the zSRT test.
   Methods: One hundred adult isiZulu first-language speakers with normal
   hearing and 76 first-language, adult isiZulu speakers with conductive or
   sensorineural hearing losses ranging from mild to severe were assessed
   on pure tone audiometry and a newly developed isiZulu SRT test.
   Convergent validity was established through agreement of the zSRT scores
   with pure tone average (PTA) scores. Concurrent validity was assessed by
   examining the steepness of the psychometric curve for each word in the
   zSRT test for each type and degree of hearing loss.
   Results: Intraclass correlation coefficient analyses showed zSRT scores
   were in substantial to very high agreement with PTA scores for the
   normal hearing and hearing loss groups (NH - right ear ICC consistency =
   0.78, left ear ICC = 0.67; HL- right ear ICC consistency = 0.97, left
   ear ICC consistency = 0.95). The mean psychometric slope (\%/dB) at 50\%
   correct perception for all words in the zSRT test was 4.92\%/dB for the
   mild conductive hearing loss group, 5.26\%/dB for the moderate
   conductive hearing loss group, 2.85\%/dB for the moderately severe
   sensorineural hearing loss group and 2.47\%/dB for the severe
   sensorineural hearing loss group. These slopes were appropriate for the
   degree of hearing loss observed in each group.
   Conclusion: The zSRT test showed convergent and concurrent validity for
   assessing SRT in first language, adult speakers of isiZulu.}},

Abstract = {{Bacillary necrosis is a problematic disease in farming of Mekong striped
   catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus). The pathogenic bacterium is
   Edwardsiella ictaluri, causing numerous white spots in swelled liver,
   kidney and spleen. An alternative to antibiotic treatment and vaccine is
   to select for improved genetic resistance to the disease that requires
   to establish a proper challenge test. Here, four challenge tests of
   Mekong striped catfish against E. ictaluri are reported proposing 3 days
   of acclimatization of test fish prior to the challenge, with restricted
   water level in the test, keeping a temperature of 26 degrees C. In the
   challenge, cohabitant shedders should be released directly into the test
   tank and make up around 1/3 of the fish, and bacteria should be added
   directly to water. The last two experiments, with the highest mortality,
   suggest that any factor involving the dead cohabitants should be removed
   and that additional experimentation should focus on bacteria (density)
   and timing for addition of bacteria to water. Genetic analyses revealed
   that resistance to bacillary necrosis tested in replicated tanks in the
   same experiment can be considered the same genetic trait.}},

Title = {{Childhood Abuse and Cognitive Function in a Large Cohort of Middle-Aged
   Women}},
Journal = {{CHILD MALTREATMENT}},
Abstract = {{Cognitive function at middle age is of particular public health
   interest, as it strongly predicts later dementia. Children who have
   experienced abuse subsequently have worse cognitive function than those
   who have not. However, it remains unclear whether the association of
   abuse with cognitive function persists into middle age. In 2014-2016,
   14,151 women ages 49-69 years who had previously responded to a
   childhood abuse questionnaire completed a cognitive battery. In models
   adjusted for childhood socioeconomic status and head trauma, combined
   physical, emotional, and sexual abuse was associated with lower scores
   on both Learning/Working Memory (severe abuse, lower scores similar to
   that observed in women 4.8 years older in our data) and Psychomotor
   Speed/Attention (severe abuse, lower scores similar to that observed in
   women to 2.9 years older in our data). Adjustment for adulthood
   socioeconomic status and health factors (e.g., smoking, hypertension)
   slightly attenuated associations. In exploratory analyses further
   adjusted for psychological distress, associations were attenuated. Women
   exposed versus unexposed to childhood abuse had poorer cognitive
   function at mid-life. Associations were particularly strong for learning
   and working memory and were not accounted for by adulthood health
   factors. Childhood abuse should be investigated as a potential risk
   factor for cognitive decline and dementia in old age.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose To evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic state on early,
   first-trimester pregnancies. Methods A retrospective cohort study
   conducted at a university-affiliated fertility center in Montreal,
   Quebec, since the COVID-19 shut down, March 13 until May 6, 2020.
   Included: all women who came for a first-trimester viability scan during
   the study period (Study group) and between March 1, 2019 and May 17,
   2019, approximately one year prior (Control). The study population
   denied symptoms of COVID-19. We reviewed all first trimester scans.
   Early first-trimester pregnancy outcomes (Viable pregnancy, arrested
   pregnancy including biochemical pregnancy loss and miscarriage, and
   ectopic pregnancy) were measured as total number and percentage. A
   multivariate analysis was performed to control for other potentially
   significant variables, as was a power analysis supporting sample size.
   Results 113 women came for a first-trimester viability scan in the study
   period, and 172 in the control period (5-11 weeks gestational age), mean
   maternal age 36.5 +/- 4.5 and 37.2 +/- 5.4 years (p = 0.28). Viable
   clinical pregnancy rate was not different between the two groups (76.1
   vs. 80.2\% in the pandemic and pre-pandemic groups p = 0.41). No
   significant difference was seen in the total number of arrested
   pregnancies (defined as the sum of biochemical, 1st trimester
   miscarriages, and blighted ova) (22.1 vs. 16.9\% p = 0.32), or in each
   type of miscarriage. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic environment does
   not seem to affect early first-trimester miscarriage rates in
   asymptomatic patients.}},

Abstract = {{Broken Riceberry rice was used as a substrate for sugar syrup production
   by the hydrolysis of raw starch-degrading enzyme as a low-temperature
   amylase (iKnowZyme(R) LTAA, Thailand). Response surface methodology
   (RSM) with a central composite design (CCD) showed that an optimized
   substrate concentration of 250 g/L yielded 13 degrees Brix of total
   soluble solid (TSS) content when incubated at 50 degrees C for 12 h. The
   major product from the broken Riceberry rice hydrolysis was glucose with
   lesser amounts of maltose and maltotriose. Maximum alcohol content (16\%
   w/v) for broken Riceberry rice wine was obtained after fermentation with
   two mixed strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for 10 days. Scanning
   electron micrographs showed that yeast strains could grow on the solid
   residue of broken Riceberry rice that supported yeast cell survival
   under stress conditions. Broken Riceberry rice wine was used as the
   substrate for vinegar fermentation by Acetobacter aceti TISTR 354.
   Maximum acetic acid concentration was achieved at 5.4\% when incubated
   at room temperature for 6 days, containing 10.92 mg/L and 965.53 +/-
   7.74 mL sample/g DPPH of anthocyanin content and antioxidant assay,
   respectively. Our finding revealed the feasibility of broken Riceberry
   rice substrate for sugar syrup, wine and vinegar production by raw
   starch-degrading enzyme hydrolysis which increased the value of low-cost
   agricultural crops through biotechnological processes.}},

Title = {{From Grading to Assessment for Learning: A Qualitative Study of Student
   Perceptions Surrounding Elimination of Core Clerkship Grades and
   Enhanced Formative Feedback}},
Journal = {{TEACHING AND LEARNING IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{314-325}},
Month = {{MAY 27}},
Abstract = {{Problem: Medical students perceive honors grading during core clerkships
   as unfair and inequitable, and negatively impacting their learning and
   wellbeing. Eliminating honors grading, a powerful extrinsic motivator,
   and emphasizing formative feedback may address these problems and
   promote intrinsic motivation and learning. However, it is unknown how
   transitioning from honors to pass/fail grading with enhanced formative
   feedback in the core clerkship year may affect student learning
   experiences, wellbeing, and perceptions of the learning environment.
   Intervention: Core clerkship grading was transitioned from
   honors/pass/fail to pass/fail at one US medical school. In addition, the
   requirement for students to obtain formative supervisor feedback was
   formalized to twice per week. Context: This qualitative study utilized
   semi-structured interviews to explore the perceptions among core
   clerkship students of learning and assessment. Interview questions
   addressed motivation, wellbeing, learning behaviors, team dynamics,
   feedback, and student and supervisor attitudes regarding assessment
   changes. The authors analyzed data inductively using thematic analysis
   informed by sensitizing concepts related to theories of motivation (goal
   orientation theory and self-determination theory). Impact: Eighteen
   students participated, including five with experience in both
   honors-eligible and pass/fail clerkships. The authors identified three
   major themes in students' descriptions of the change in approach to
   assessment: student engagement in clerkships, wellbeing, and recognition
   of learning context. Student engagement subthemes included intrinsic
   motivation for patient care rather than performing; sense of agency over
   learning, including ability to set learning priorities, seek and receive
   feedback, take learning risks, and disagree with supervisors, and
   collaborative relationships with peers and team members. Positive
   wellbeing was characterized by low stress, sense of authenticity with
   team members, prioritized physical health, and attention to personal
   life. Learning context subthemes included recognition of variability of
   clerkship contexts with pass/fail grading mitigating fairness and equity
   concerns, support of the grading change from residents and some
   attendings, and implications surrounding future stress and residency
   selection. Lessons Learned: Students perceive a transition from honors
   grading to pass/fail with increased feedback as supporting their
   engagement in learning, intrinsic motivation, and wellbeing. Drivers of
   wellbeing appear to include students' feelings of control, achieved
   through the ability to seek learning opportunities, teaching, and
   constructive feedback without the perceived need to focus on impressing
   others. Ongoing evaluation of the consequences of this shift in
   assessment is needed.}},

Title = {{Integrating a Co-occurring Disorders Intervention in a Rural Drug
   Treatment Court: Preliminary 6-Month Outcomes and Policy Implications}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION}},
Abstract = {{Little research has focused on systematically integrating clinical
   treatment within drug court settings (a type of specialty court, and the
   most popular type of alternative to incarceration program). This is
   particularly important for rural drug courts serving participants with
   both co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders, as these
   participants often have difficulty engaging in care which is compounded
   by limited access to treatment services in their communities. This
   article reports on the preliminary outcomes and policy implications of
   integrating MISSION-Criminal Justice (MISSION-CJ), a co-occurring mental
   health and substance use hybrid wraparound treatment and linkage
   intervention, within a rural Massachusetts drug court. In this open
   pilot, 73 participants completed an intake and 80\% completed a 6-month
   follow-up assessment. The participants were primarily Caucasian
   (83.6\%), male (57.5\%), reported substantial criminal justice histories
   with an average of 13.93 prior arrests, had extensive substance use and
   mental health histories, with 71\% reporting opioid use, 74\% had
   anxiety, and 68.5\% depression at intake. Six-month data indicate
   statistically significant reductions in nights spent in jail, number of
   arrests, acute behavioral health symptoms, illicit drug use, as well as
   an increase in employment and securing stable housing. These data
   suggest that MISSION-CJ was feasible to implement within a rural drug
   court. MISSION-CJ is a unique intervention as it offers co-occurring
   disorders treatment and linkage services that work both within a
   specialty court setting and in the community. These findings pose
   critical policy implications as integrated services and a hybrid
   treatment model are considered to be best practice and may be optimal
   for rural drug courts where there are limited treatment and service
   resources.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, the authors suggested a rotation-invariant local binary
   pattern-based weighted generalized closest neighbor (RILBP-WGCN) method
   for HSI classification. The proposed RILBP is an enhanced texture-based
   classification paradigm that utilizes local binary pattern filter for
   some designated bands to generate a broad sketch of spatial texture
   information. Likewise, the proposed WGCN technique efficiently maintains
   the spatial uniformity between the nearby pixels via utilizing a local
   weight scheme and point-to-set distance. Also, as a postprocessing step,
   a label enhancement method is included for additional enhancement of the
   label uniformity as well as increases the performance of classification
   method. The color composite remotely sensed image of the initial three
   subsequent bands is segmented into several consistent regions by
   utilizing the graph-based superpixel segmentation technique. Then,
   extracted super pixels have been made extra homogeneous by utilizing a
   segment grouping process. Finally, advanced decision-level fusion is
   also applied on the retrieved local LBP features and unique spectral
   features, where linear opinion pool executes a serious role for
   concatenating the probabilistic outcomes of numerous spectral as well as
   texture features. The authors evaluated the proposed technique by
   comparing them with the seven competing methods on numerous datasets
   related to HSI classification. Evaluation results confirmed that the
   classification effects of proposed RILBP-WGCN algorithm are
   significantly better in contrast to other competing classification
   schemes.}},

Title = {{Acute Effects of Different Intensities of Cycling Acute Exercise on
   Carotid Arterial Apparent Elasticity and Hemodynamic Variables}},
Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{Background. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is closely related to arterial
   elasticity and hemodynamics. Exercises have been reported to immediately
   decrease arterial apparent elasticity and regulate hemodynamic
   variables. However, the relationship between them and exercise intensity
   remains elusive. The purpose of this study was to determine the acute
   effects of different intensities of acute cycling exercise on carotid
   arterial apparent elasticity and hemodynamics. Methods. 32 healthy men
   (age: 19.4 +/- 0.6 years) attended the laboratory on five occasions and
   completed cycling acute exercise for 20 minutes at five intensities
   (40\%, 50\%, 60\%, 70\%, and 80\% heart rate reserve (HRR)). At the
   right carotid artery, center-line velocity and arterial inner diameter
   waveforms were examined before and immediately after exercise. Based
   upon the measured data, the classical hemodynamic theory was used to
   calculate the apparent elasticity and the local hemodynamic variables.
   Results. The arterial apparent stiffness and the apparent elastic
   modulus following acute cycling exercise at 60\% to 80\% HRR were
   significantly higher than baseline. The mean center-line velocity
   accelerated from 50\% to 80\% HRR, but no intensity of intervention
   altered mean blood flow. Immediately after intervention, the mean wall
   shear stress and oscillatory shear index increased. Conclusions. Aerobic
   cycling intervention, with intensity from 40\% to 80\% HRR, did not
   change the brain blood supply. A bout of cycling intervention decreased
   apparent elasticity, and there was an intensity-dependent effect on
   apparent elasticity and hemodynamic variables. This study would provide
   referable data for the further study on the effects of aerobic exercise
   on arterial hemodynamics and elasticity and underlying physiological
   mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Weak value amplification is a popular method in quantum metrology for
   enhancing the sensitivity at the expense of the signal intensity.
   Recently, it was suggested that the trade-off between signal intensity
   and sensitivity can be improved by using an entangled auxiliary system.
   Here, we experimentally investigate such entanglement-assisted weak
   measurement of small conditional phase shifts induced by an interaction
   between ancilla and meter qubits. We utilize entangled photon pairs and
   implement the required three-qubit quantum logic circuit with linear
   optics. The circuit comprises a two-qubit controlled phase gate and a
   three-qubit controlled-controlled phase gate with fully tunable
   conditional phase shifts. We fully characterize the output states of our
   circuit by quantum state tomography and perform a comprehensive analysis
   of the trade-off between the measurement sensitivity and the success
   probability of the protocol. The observed experimental results are in
   good qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions, but the overall
   performance of our setup is limited by various experimental
   imperfections. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of the
   influence of dephasing of the entangled ancilla state, which is one of
   the main sources of imperfections in the experiment. We also discuss the
   ultimate scaling with the dimension of the entangled ancilla system. (C)

Abstract = {{The daily productivity of two solar stills (SSs) was investigated
   experimentally and numerically. Two modifications were done to increase
   the daily productivity of the conventional SS which include the
   embedment of mirrors on two side walls and perforated-suspended plate
   (SP) with various depths. The perforated-SP was placed inside the basin
   water with different bed depths. The left and right sides were
   fabricated in double glass with a gap distance to avoid more heat losses
   from the side walls and simultaneously to place a mirror according to
   the daytime. The theoretical model was solved numerically by utilizing
   the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method and the program was written by
   FORTRAN. The experimental results of conventional SS were verified by
   the numerical method. The maximum productivity was obtained 4.24
   kg/m(2)/day where the mirror was placed in sides and the suspend plate
   was placed at 0.7 cm in the basin water with a depth of 2.6 cm. The
   daily productivity was increased by 43\% compared to the conventional
   type. In addition, the thermal efficiency of SS increased 28\% in

Abstract = {{The analysis of histological images is based on visual assessment of
   tissues by specialists using an optical microscopy. This task can be
   time-consuming and challenging, mainly due to the complexity of the
   structures and diseases under investigation. These facts have motivated
   the development of computational methods to support specialists in
   research and decision-making. Despite the different computational
   strategies available in the literature, the solutions based on genetic
   algorithm have not been fully explored to provide the best combination
   of features, selection algorithms and classifiers. In this paper, we
   describe an approach based on genetic algorithm able to evaluate a
   significant number of features, selection methods and classifiers in
   order to provide an acceptable association for the diagnosis and pattern
   recognition of non-Hodgkin lymphomas and colorectal cancer. The
   chromosomal structure was represented with four genes. The evaluation
   and selection of individuals, as well as the crossover and mutation
   processes, were defined to distinguish the groups under investigation,
   with the highest AUC value and the smallest number of features. The
   tests were performed considering 1512 features from histological images,
   different population sizes and number of iterations. An initial
   population of 50 individuals and 50 iterations provided the best result
   (AUC value of 0.984) for the colorectal histological images. For
   non-Hodgkin lymphoma images, the best result (AUC value of 0.947) was
   obtained with a population of 500 individuals and 50 iterations. The
   proposed methodology with detailed information regarding the methods,
   features and best associations are relevant contributions for the
   community interested in the study of pattern recognition of colorectal
   cancer and lymphomas.}},

   to a topological phase transition from a non-Abelian topological phase
   with the Chern number equal to +/- 1 to an Abelian phase with the Chern
   number equal to +/- 2, in which the Z(2) vortices behave as Abelian

Title = {{Comparing the efficacy of trabeculectomy and XEN gel microstent
   implantation for the treatment of primary open-angle glaucoma: a

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety profile of
   XEN microstent implantation with trabeculectomy (TET) in a comparable
   group of open-angle glaucoma cases in a retrospective, monocentric,
   single-surgeon setting. Each treatment group consisted of 100 eyes of
   100 patients. At regular follow-up visits during the first 12 months
   after surgery, the following assessments were conducted and compared:
   intraocular pressure (IOP), number of IOP-lowering medications applied,
   best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and visual field testing. In both
   groups mean IOP was significantly reduced (p<0.001). Mean IOP dropped
   from 24.8<plus/minus>7.8 to 14.8 +/- 4.0 mmHg in the TET and from 24.5
   +/- 6.7 to 16.6 +/- 4.8 mmHg in the XEN group. The number of active
   compounds in the prescribed medication dropped from 3.3 +/- 1.2 to 1.3
   +/- 1.4 in the TET and from 3.0 +/- 1.1 to 1.4 +/- 1.5 in the XEN group.
   BCVA and mean defect of static automated perimetry did not show a change
   of statistical significance in either group. Complications were more
   frequent after TET (p=0.005) while postoperative needling was more
   frequent in the XEN group (p=0.021). TET and XEN led to a significant
   reduction of IOP and IOP-lowering medication, while BCVA and visual
   field indices remained mostly unaltered over a 12-month postsurgical
   follow-up.}},

Title = {{Robotic-assisted TKA leads to a better prosthesis alignment and a better
   joint line restoration as compared to conventional TKA: a prospective
   randomized controlled trial}},
Journal = {{KNEE SURGERY SPORTS TRAUMATOLOGY ARTHROSCOPY}},
Abstract = {{Purpose Correct positioning and alignment of the prosthesis is a very
   important factor for durability of prosthesis and implant survival which
   is improved with the use of technology in total knee arthroplasty.
   However, the long-term functional outcomes and survivorship are unclear.
   For this study, it was hypothesized that mechanical axis alignment of
   lower limb, post-operative joint line restoration, femoral and tibial
   component alignment is more accurate with the new handheld semi-active
   robotic-assisted TKA. Method From April-2019 to March-2020, 60 patients
   with unilateral knee osteoarthritis who underwent total knee
   arthroplasties were included in this prospective randomised controlled
   study. Computer generated randomization was used. Study included 48
   female patients and 12 male patients. Pre-operative and post-operative
   radiographic measurements were done and compared between the two groups.
   Results There was a significant difference between two groups with
   respect to mechanical axis deviation, joint line deviation and coronal
   alignment of femoral and tibial prosthesis. Mechanical axis deviation >
   3 degrees was seen in eight cases (28.5\%) in C-TKA group compared to
   one case (3.1\%) in RA-TKA (p 0.019). Joint line deviation of 3.5 mm was
   noted in C-TKA group as compared to 0.9 mm in RA-TKA group (p < 0.001)
   which was statistically significant. However, whether this difference of
   2.6 mm of joint line elevation between C-TKA and RA-TKA leads to any
   difference in clinical outcome in terms of knee kinematics and knee
   flexion needs to be investigated with further studies. Clinically
   restoring normal joint line is important for improved knee function
   after primary TKA. No significant difference was noted in femoral
   component rotation on post-operative computed tomography (CT) scan.
   Conclusion The novel imageless, handheld semi-autonomous robotic system
   for TKA is highly accurate with respect to component positioning in
   coronal plane and mechanical alignment as compared to conventional TKA.
   Joint line is elevated in conventional TKA but is accurately restored
   using the robotic-assisted TKA which may lead to better patellofemoral
   kinematics.}},

Title = {{Influence of probiotic supplementation on the developing microbiota in
   human preterm neonates}},
Journal = {{GUT MICROBES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-16}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Oral administration of probiotic bacteria to preterm neonates has been
   recommended to prevent the development of necrotizing enterocolitis
   (NEC). The influence of probiotics on the endogenous microbiome,
   however, has remained incompletely understood.
   Study design \& methods
   Here, we performed an observational study including 80 preterm neonates
   born at a gestational age <32-weeks to characterize the persistence of
   probiotic bacteria after no treatment or oral administration of two
   different probiotic formula and their influence on the microbial
   ecosystem during and after the intervention and their association with
   the development of NEC. Weekly fecal samples were profiled by 16S rRNA
   sequencing and monitored for the presence of the probiotic bacteria by
   quantitative PCR.
   Results
   Microbiota profiles differed significantly between the control group and
   both probiotic groups. Probiotic supplementation was associated with
   lower temporal variation as well as higher relative abundance of
   Bifidobacterium and Enterobacter combined with reduced abundance of
   Escherichia, Enterococcus, and Klebsiella. Colonization by probiotic
   bifidobacteria was observed in approximately 50\% of infants although it
   remained transient in the majority of cases. A significantly reduced
   monthly incidence of NEC was observed in neonates supplemented with
   probiotics.
   Conclusion
   Our results demonstrate successful transient colonization by probiotic
   bacteria and a significant influence on the endogenous microbiota with a
   reduced abundance of bacterial taxa associated with the development of
   NEC. These results emphasize that probiotic supplementation may allow
   targeted manipulation of the enteric microbiota and confer a clinical
   benefit. (Clinical Trial Registry accession number: DRKS/GCTR 00021034)}},

   spatial dependence}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{Recently, flood risk assessments have been extended to national and
   continental scales. Most of these assessments assume homogeneous
   scenarios, i.e. the regional risk estimate is obtained by summing up the
   local estimates, whereas each local damage value has the same
   probability of exceedance. This homogeneity assumption ignores the
   spatial variability in the flood generation processes. Here, we develop
   a multi-site, extreme value statistical model for 379 catchments across
   Europe, generate synthetic flood time series which consider the spatial
   correlation between flood peaks in all catchments, and compute
   corresponding economic damages. We find that the homogeneity assumption
   overestimates the 200-year flood damage, a benchmark indicator for the
   insurance industry, by 139\%, 188\% and 246\% for the United Kingdom
   (UK), Germany and Europe, respectively. Our study demonstrates the
   importance of considering the spatial dependence patterns, particularly
   of extremes, in large-scale risk assessments.}},

Abstract = {{We quantify the maximum transmission reach for phase-insensitive
   amplifier (PIA) and phase-sensitive amplifier (PSA) links with different
   modulation formats and show that the maximum transmission reach increase
   (MTRI) when using PSAs compared to PIAs is enhanced for higher-order
   modulation formats. The higher-order modulation formats are more
   susceptible to smaller phase rotations from nonlinearities, and PSAs are
   efficient in mitigating these smaller phase distortions. Numerical
   simulations were performed for single- and multi-span PIA and PSA links
   with single and multiple wavelength channels. We obtain a significant
   enhancement in the MTRI with PSAs compared to PIAs when using
   higher-order modulation formats for both the single- and multi-channel
   systems in single- and multi-span links. We verify the enhancement with
   a single-span, single-channel system experiment. We also demonstrate,
   for the first time, a 64-QAM modulation format fiber transmission in
   phase-sensitively amplified link, with a 13.3-dB maximum allowable span

Abstract = {{The current study tested the ``beauty as currency{''} hypothesis in the
   framework of Objectification theory with a sample of Chinese young
   women. Four hundred and four college women completed a pencil-and-paper

   associated with acceptance of cosmetic surgery and career aspirations
   through the serial meditation of self-objectification and body
   surveillance. The results indicated that self-objectification and body

   currency and acceptance of cosmetic surgery. Body surveillance mediated
   the relationship between beauty as currency and career aspirations.
   These findings provide further evidence for the ``beauty as currency{''}
   hypothesis, suggesting the feminine beauty ideology may lead to women's
   higher acceptance of cosmetic surgery and lower career aspirations via
   the self-objectifying process. Our study provides some implications for

Abstract = {{Classical computers allow security of cryptographic protocols based on

   This implies that high computational power can have a positive outcome

   Quantum machines claim to possess such power. Two parties interested in

   experimental verification of the BB84 protocol using three bases has
   been performed in this paper, out of which sub-cases have been
   considered based on whether or not Eve has attempted an attack. The
   following part includes experimental realization of the B92 protocol
   which was introduced by Charles Bennett in the year 1992. Possibility of
   an Eve's attack is considered and implemented. Succeeding part relies on
   experimental implementation of the protocol that was introduced by Acin,

Abstract = {{Gelatin hydrogels are naturally derived scaffolds useful for tissue
   engineering because of their cytocompatibility and controllable
   degradability. However, they are brittle and inflexible when dry, which
   limits their use for in utero tissue engineering in large animal models.
   Therefore, in this study, we attempted to generate flexible gelatin
   sheets by adding various plasticizers with different molecular weights
   (MW). We systematically evaluated the flexibility, sustainability, and
   potential clinical utility of the resulting flexible gelatin sheets.
   Gelatin sheets with low-MW plasticizers, such as monosaccharides or
   sugar alcohols, showed a reduced tensile modulus in dynamic
   viscoelasticity, which reflected their actual flexibility. Wet gelatin
   sheets containing plasticizers showed higher tensile strength than the
   nonplasticizer control, although wet gelatin sheets under all conditions
   had a much lower tensile strength than dry gelatin sheets. In a
   functional study, gelatin sheets containing glycerol, which has the
   lowest MW among sugar alcohols, showed encouraging results, such as good
   fit to the curvature of the experimental animal, biocompatibility, and
   suitability for endoscopic approaches. The findings of this study should
   enable the expansion of future applications for flexible gelatin sheets.}},

Abstract = {{Black Lives Matter is a clarion call for racial equality and racial
   justice. With the arrival of Africans as slaves in 1619, a racial
   hierarchy was formed in the United States. However, slavery is commonly
   dismissed as that less than noble aspect of the United States' history
   without really confronting the legacies of racial inequality and racial
   injustice left in its wake. White supremacy, based on the myths of white
   superiority and Black inferiority, have obscured racial inequality and
   racial injustice, resulting in blaming the victims. Using Black Lives
   Matter as a platform, we focus on some key considerations for theory,
   research, education, training, and practice in clinical, community, and
   larger systems contexts. Broadly, we focus on Black Lives Matter,
   literally; Black dehumanization; historical oppression; healing; and

Title = {{Age and sex distribution of beat-to-beat blood pressure variability
   after transient ischemic attack and minor stroke: A population-based
   study}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STROKE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{16}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Beat-to-beat blood pressure variability is associated with increased
   stroke risk but its importance at different ages is unclear.
   Aims
   To determine the age-sex distribution of blood pressure variability in
   patients with transient ischemic stroke or minor stroke.
   Methods
   In consecutive patients within six weeks of transient ischemic stroke or
   non-disabling stroke (Oxford Vascular Study), non-invasive blood
   pressure was measured beat-to-beat over five minutes (Finometer). The
   age-sex distribution of blood pressure variability (residual coefficient
   of variation) was determined for systolic blood pressure and diastolic
   blood pressure. The risk of top-decile blood pressure variability was
   estimated (logistic regression), unadjusted, and adjusted for age, sex,
   and cardiovascular risk factors.
   Results
   In 908 of 1013 patients, excluding 54 in atrial fibrillation and 51 with
   low quality recordings, residual coefficient of variation was positively
   skewed with a median systolic residual coefficient of variation of 4.2\%
   (IQR 3.2-5.5) and diastolic residual coefficient of variation of 3.9\%
   (3.0-5.5), with 90th centile thresholds of 7.2 and 7.3\%. Median
   systolic residual coefficient of variation was higher in patients under
   50 years (4.5 and 3.0-5.3) compared to 60-70 years (4.1 and 3.2-5.2),
   but rose to 4.5\% (3.5-6.9) above 80 years, with an increasingly
   positive skew. The proportion of patients with markedly elevated blood
   pressure variability in the top-decile increased significantly per
   decade (OR 1.72, p < 0.001), after adjustment for sex and risk factors.
   Conclusions
   Median beat-to-beat blood pressure variability fell in midlife,
   reflecting loss of physiological, organized blood pressure variability.
   However, rates of markedly elevated blood pressure variability
   significantly increased with greater age, suggesting that blood pressure
   variability may be particularly important in older patients.}},

Title = {{Inhibitory interneurons in a brainstem circuit adjust their inhibitory
   motifs to process multimodal input}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{599}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Key points
   Inhibitory-interneuron networks, consisting of multiple forms of circuit
   motifs including reciprocal (inhibitory interneurons inhibiting other
   interneurons) and feedforward (inhibitory interneurons inhibiting
   principal neurons) connections, are crucial in processing sensory
   information.
   The present study applies a statistical method to in vivo multichannel
   spike trains of dorsal cochlear nucleus neurons to disentangle
   reciprocal and feedforward-inhibitory motifs.
   After inducing input-specific plasticity, reciprocal and feedforward
   inhibition are found to be differentially regulated, and the combined
   effect synergistically modulates circuit output.
   The findings highlight the interplay among different circuit motifs as a
   key element in neural computation.
   Inhibitory interneurons play an essential role in neural computations by
   utilizing a combination of reciprocal (interneurons inhibiting each
   other) and feedforward (interneuron inhibiting the principal neuron)
   inhibition to process information. To disentangle the interplay between
   the two inhibitory-circuit motifs and understand their effects on the
   circuit output, in vivo recordings were made from the guinea pig dorsal
   cochlear nucleus, a cerebellar-like brainstem circuit. Spikes from
   inhibitory interneurons (cartwheel cell) and principal output neurons
   (fusiform cell) were compared before and after manipulating their common
   multimodal input. Using a statistical model based on the Cox method of
   modulated renewal process of spike train influence, reciprocal- and
   feedforward-inhibition motifs were quantified. In response to altered
   multimodal input, reciprocal inhibition was strengthened while
   feedforward inhibition was weakened, and the two motifs combined to
   modulate fusiform cell output and acoustic-driven responses. These
   findings reveal the cartwheel cell's role in auditory and multimodal
   processing, as well as illustrated the balance between different
   inhibitory-circuit motifs as a key element in neural computation.}},

Abstract = {{This article aims to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms and
   prognosis-related genes in pancreatic cancer metastasis. Pancreatic
   cancer metastasis-related gene chip data were downloaded from GENE
   EXPRESSION OMNIBUS(GEO)database. Differentially expressed genes were
   screened after R-package pre-treatment. Functional annotations and
   related signalling pathways were analysed using DAVID software. GEPIA
   (Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis) was used to perform
   prognostic analysis, and differential genes associated with prognosis
   were screened and validated using data from GEO. We screened 40 healthy
   patients, 40 primary pancreatic cancer and 40 metastatic pancreatic
   cancer patients, collected serum, designed primers and used qPCR to test
   the expression of prognosis-related genes in each group. 109
   differentially expressed genes related with pancreatic cancer metastasis
   were screened, of which 49 were up-regulated and 60 were down-regulated.
   Functional annotation and pathway analysis revealed differentially
   expressed genes were mainly concentrated in protein activation cascade,
   extracellular matrix construction, decomposition, etc In the biological
   process, it is mainly involved in signalling pathways such as PPAR,
   PI3K-Akt and ECM receptor interaction. Prognostic analysis showed the
   expression levels of four genes were significantly correlated with the
   overall survival time of patients with pancreatic cancer, namely SCG5,
   CRYBA2, CPE and CHGB. qPCR experiments showed the expression of these
   four genes was decreased in both the primary pancreatic cancer group and
   the metastatic pancreatic cancer group, and the latter was more
   significantly reduced. Pancreatic cancer metastasis is closely related
   to the activation of PPAR pathway, PI3K-Akt pathway and ECM receptor
   interaction. SCG5, CRYBA2, CPE and CHGB genes are associated with the
   prognosis of pancreatic cancer, and their low expression suggests a poor
   prognosis.}},

Abstract = {{Raphidocelis subcapitata is one of the most frequently used species for
   algal growth inhibition tests. Accordingly, many microalgal culture
   collections worldwide maintain R. subcapitata for distribution to users.
   All R. subcapitata strains maintained in these collections are derived
   from the same cultured strain, NIVA-CHL1. However, considering that 61
   years have passed since this strain was isolated, we suspected that
   NIVA-CHL1 in culture collections might have acquired various mutations.
   In this study, we compared the genome sequences among NIVA-CHL1 from 8
   microalgal culture collections and one laboratory in Japan to evaluate
   the presence of mutations. We found single-nucleotide polymorphisms or
   indels at 19,576 to 28,212 sites per strain in comparison with the
   genome sequence of R. subcapitata NIES-35, maintained at the National
   Institute for Environmental Studies, Tsukuba, Japan. These mutations
   were detected not only in non-coding but also in coding regions; some of
   the latter mutations may affect protein function. In growth inhibition
   test with 3,5-dichlorophenol, EC50 values varied 2.6-fold among the 9
   strains. In the ATCC 22662-2 and CCAP 278/4 strains, we also detected a
   mutation in the gene encoding small-conductance mechanosensitive ion
   channel, which may lead to protein truncation and loss of function.
   Growth inhibition test with sodium chloride suggested that osmotic
   regulation has changed in ATCC 22662-2 and CCAP 278/4 in comparison with
   NIES-35.}},

Abstract = {{Structural health monitoring of multilayer thermal barrier coatings
   (TBCs) is very vital to ensure the structural integrity and service
   performance of the hot-section components of the aero-engine. In this
   paper, we theoretically and numerically demonstrated that the terahertz
   time domain spectrum and the terahertz reflectance spectrum could be
   adopted to estimate the structure parameters, based on the finite
   difference time domain (FDTD) algorithm, 64 samples which were imported
   with three kinds of 64 sets structure parameters had been calculated to
   obtain the time domain and terahertz reflectance signals. To mimic the
   actual test signals, the original FDTD simulation signals were processed
   by adding the Gaussian white noise and wavelet noise reduction. To
   reduce the data dimension and improve the calculation efficiency during
   modeling, the principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm was adopted
   to reduce the dimensions of time-domain data and reflectance data.
   Finally, these data after multiple signal processing and PCA feature
   extraction were used to train the extreme learning machine (ELM),
   combining the genetic algorithm (GA) could optimize the PCA-ELM model
   and further improve the prediction performance of the hybrid model. Our
   proposed novel and efficient terahertz nondestructive technology
   combined with the hybrid machine learning approaches provides great
   potential applications on the multilayer TBCs structural integrity
   evaluation. (C) 2020 Optical Society of America under the terms of the

Abstract = {{Flexible organic light emitting diodes (FOLEDSs) require a barrier layer
   with transparency, thermal stability, and flame retardance to prevent
   water from inducing the corrosion of electrode and ultimately
   deterioration. Herein, HPS spheres were incorporated into the vinylidene
   chloride-methyl acrylate (VDC-MA) matrix to enhance the water vapor
   barrier property, thermostability, and anti-glare effect. Scanning
   electron microscopy showed that HPS spheres were more compatible with VM
   (89.86-10.14) by presenting better water vapor barrier property rather
   than with VM (92.38-7.62). The anti-glare effect of composite film was
   improved with HPS spheres, while the transparency still maintained over
   80\%. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that the weight loss still
   maintained over 50\% with the incorporation of HPS spheres, indicating
   significant improvement compared with control VDC-MA films. Our research
   supplies an effective approach to prepare transparent and flame
   retardant hybrid films with enhanced water vapor barrier,
   thermostability, and anti-glare properties, which is promising in the
   encapsulation of FOLEDSs and other electronics areas.}},

Abstract = {{In order to eliminate the deficiencies of the solvent-based cold patch
   asphalt mixture, this paper presented the cold patch asphalt mixture
   modified with waterborne epoxy resin (WER). Firstly, the new evaluation
   method were put forward based on its technical features and application
   requirements. Then the influence of different compositions and contents
   of WER on the cold patch asphalt liquid was evaluated by laboratory
   tests. Further, the pavement performance and workability of WER modified
   cold patch asphalt mixture were systematically evaluated. The results
   show that (i) WER can significantly improve strength, moisture
   susceptibility, high temperature performance and cohesion. However, the
   inappropriate addition may lead to poor storability and low temperature
   performance. So the optimal WER content is recommended 1.2-1.8 wt\%, and
   its component ratio of epoxy resin to curing agent is 3:1. (ii)
   Different WER components produce different performances of mixture. The
   EP-20 + HGC brings about higher curing strength, excellent high
   temperature performance and storability. In comparison, the mixture
   modified with EP-20 + HGA owns preferable initial strength and moisture
   susceptibility. In the practical project, it is necessary to choose
   suitable WER considering the performance deficiency of cold patch
   materials and maintenance needs.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue regeneration driven by immunomodulatory agents has emerged as a
   potential solution for repairing bone defects. However, the therapeutic
   benefits are compromised by disturbances in the pro- and
   anti-inflammatory balance. Here, using magnesium nanoparticles (MgNPs)
   as a template, magnesium-enriched graphene oxide nanoscrolls
   (MgNPs@GNSs) designed for combinational modulation of the inflammatory
   response are reported. First, the different effects of graphene oxide
   (GO) and magnesium ions (Mg2+) on Raw264.7 macrophage phenotype
   transformation are screened. The results reveal that GO activates
   inflammatory M1 macrophages, and that Mg2+ facilitates repolarization of
   M1 macrophages to the pro-healing M2 phenotype. With sustained release
   of Mg2+, the MgNPs@GNS nanoplatform can orchestrate harmonious type 1
   and type 2 inflammatory responses. Mg2+ decrease the internalization of
   GO and downregulate the nuclear factor kappa-B pathway, which is
   profoundly involved in the inflammatory process. A series of experiments
   show that the ordered inflammatory response induced by MgNPs@GNSs
   stimulates in vitro angiogenesis and osteogenesis through chemotactic,
   mitogenic, and morphogenic actions. Obvious vascularized bone
   regeneration is achieved in a rat cranial bone defect model via
   MgNPs@GNS deposited decellularized bone matrix scaffold. Therefore, the
   potential of using inherently therapeutic nanomedicine to modulate
   biomaterial-induced immune responses and thus enhance bone regeneration
   is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are present in many types of tumors
   and play a pivotal role in tumor progression and immunosuppression.
   Fibroblast-activation protein (FAP), which is overexpressed on CAFs, has
   been indicated as a universal tumor target. However, FAP expression is
   not restricted to tumors, and systemic treatment against FAP often
   causes severe side effects. To solve this problem, a photodynamic
   therapy (PDT) approach is developed based on ZnF16Pc-loaded and
   FAP-specific single chain variable fragment (scFv)-conjugated
   apoferritin nanoparticles, or alpha FAP-Z@FRT. alpha FAP-Z@FRT PDT
   efficiently eradicates CAFs in tumors without inducing systemic
   toxicity. When tested in murine 4T1 models, the treatment elicits
   anti-cancer immunity, causing suppression of both primary and distant
   tumors, that is, the abscopal effect. Treatment efficacy is enhanced
   when alpha FAP-Z@FRT PDT is used in combination with anti-PD1
   antibodies. Interestingly, it is found that the PDT treatment not only
   elicits a cellular immunity against cancer cells, but also stimulates an
   anti-CAFs immunity. This is supported by an adoptive cell transfer
   study, where T cells taken from 4T1-tumor-bearing animals treated with
   alpha FAP PDT retard the growth of A549 tumors established on nude mice.
   Overall, this approach is unique for permitting site-specific
   eradication of CAFs and inducing a broad spectrum anti-cancer immunity.}},

   referring to recent insights into fashion journalism. It particularly
   focuses on the dialectics between local and global fashion-related
   discourses within them. In this regard, it is suggested that reflections
   of the Swedish social anthropologist Ulf Hannerz on the
   metropolis-province interplay, media, and local cultural actors provide
   an insightful framework for identifying the potentialities of peripheral
   fashion journalism and the role of a local editor in realizing them - as

Abstract = {{Illegal resource use in protected areas is a problem for park managers.
   We investigated status and distribution of illegal activities inside
   Rwenzori Mountains National Park in areas adjacent to four sites where
   hydropower projects were being developed outside the park. We used
   in-park plot, nonplot-based methods and community surveys and compared
   findings from these with ranger patrol records of the Uganda Wildlife
   Authority. Seventeen kinds of illegal activities were recorded.
   Collection of medicinal plants and poaching were the most pervasive
   forms of illegal activities inside the park. Poaching exhibited
   significant differences (p = 0.03) across sites, and prevalence of
   poaching signs increased with distance from park boundary at two sites
   (p = 0.05). The study revealed higher levels of illegal activities than
   earlier recorded from ranger patrol data. Sixty-eight per cent (68\%)
   and 44\% of the respondents reported participation in collection of
   medicinal plants and poaching, respectively. Ninety-eight per cent
   (98\%) of respondents agreed that the park is an important source for
   natural resources. Ranger patrols should extend further inside the park
   rather than near the boundaries as has been the case. The findings set a
   valuable benchmark for assessing the temporal and spatial variation of
   illegal resource extraction over the hydropower projects' duration.}},

   are cut according to the ASTM standards, and mechanical and tribological
   properties of different fiber orientations which are 0 degrees, 15

Title = {{Plume Effect of Fractional Radiofrequency Verus Laser Resurfacing:
   Considerations in the COVID-19 Pandemic}},
Journal = {{LASERS IN SURGERY AND MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{115-118}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic requires us all to re-evaluate
   aesthetic practices to ensure optimal patient safety during elective
   procedures. Specifically, energy-based devices and lasers require
   special consideration, as they may emit plume which has been shown to
   contain tissue debris and aerosolized biological materials. Prior
   studies have shown transmission of viruses and bacteria via plume (i.e.,
   HIV and papillomavirus). The purpose of this study was to evaluate plume
   characteristics of the Er:YAG resurfacing laser (Sciton; Palo Alto, CA)
   and compare it to the Morpheus8 fractional radiofrequency device
   (InMode; Lake Forest, CA).
   Methods Five patients who underwent aesthetic resurfacing and/or skin
   tightening of the face and neck were treated with the Er:YAG (Sciton
   Joule, Palo Alto, CA) and/or fractional radiofrequency (Morpheus8, Lake
   Forest, CA) between April 1 and May 11, 2020. Data collected included
   patient demographics, past medical history, treatment parameters,
   adverse events, particle counter data, as well as high magnification
   video equiptment. Patients were evaluated during treatment with a
   calibrated particle meter (PCE; Jupiter, FL). The particle meter was
   used at a consistent focal distance (6-12 inches) to sample the
   surrounding environment during treatment at 2.83 L/min to a counting
   efficiency of 50\% at 0.3 mu m and 100\% at >0.45 mu m. Recordings were
   obtained with and without a smoke evacuator.
   Results Of our cohort (n = 5), average age was 58 years old (STD +/-
   7.2). Average Fitzpatrick type was between 2 and 3. Two patients
   received Er:YAG fractional resurfacing in addition to fractional
   radiofrequency during the same treatment session. Two patients had
   fractional radiofrequency only, and one patient had laser treatment with
   the Er:YAG only. There were no adverse events recorded. The particle
   counter demonstrated ambient baseline particles/second (pps) at 8 (STD
   +/- 6). During fractional radiofrequency treatment at 1-mm depth, the
   mean recording was 8 pps (STD +/- 8). At the more superficial depth of
   0.5 mm, recordings showed 10 pps (STD +/- 6). The Er:YAG laser
   resurfacing laser had mean readings of 44 pps (STD +/- 11). When the
   particle sizes were broken down by size, the fractional radiofrequency
   device had overall smaller particle sizes with a count of 251 for 0.3 mu
   m (STD +/- 147) compared with Er:YAG laser with a count of 112 for 0.3
   mu m (STD +/- 84). The fractional radiofrequency did not appear to emit
   particles >5 mu m throughout the treatment, however, the Er:YAG laser
   consistently recorded majority of particles in the range of 5-10 mu m.
   The addition of the smoke evacuator demonstrated a 50\% reduction in
   both particles per second recorded as well as all particle sizes.
   Conclusion Re-evaluation of the plume effect from aesthetic devices has
   become important during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further studies are
   required to characterize viability of COVID-19 viability and
   transmissibility in plume specimens. Based on this pilot study, we
   recommend that devices that generate little to no plume such as
   fractional radiofrequency devices be used in Phase I reopening of
   practice while devices that generate a visible plume such as Er:YAG
   laser resurfacing devices be avoided and only used with appropriate
   personal protective equipment in addition to a smoke evacuator in Phase
   IV reopening.}},

   minorities. Hiring should privilege societal accomplishments and life
   experience over age, gender, and education credentials. Museum boards
   must include community representatives with the same rights as donors.
   Exhibition topics should be relevant to the lives of community members
   and spaces beyond museum buildings should be used as venues. Current
   exhibitions and collections, or even complete museums, should be
   re-interpreted by people represented in them. Decolonization efforts
   should include a national portal of items with suspect provenance and
   the Eurocentric nomenclature for cataloging should be revised. Overall,
   museums must promote ``shared authority{''} and include individuals and

Abstract = {{The literature on epistemic injustice is increasingly turning to the
   question of countering epistemic injustice. But few authors note that
   the strategies against epistemic injustice are complemented by a more
   fundamental disposition, intellectual self-trust. Most of the time,
   intellectual self-trust is merely mentioned as an individual disposition
   that is harmed by epistemic injustice. In this article, I argue that
   intellectual self-trust as an optimistic disposition is a central tool
   for countering epistemic injustice. Both individual intellectual
   self-trust and collective intellectual self-trust, as well as groups and
   communities themselves are central in obstructing the effects of
   epistemic injustice and engaging in resistance against epistemic
   injustice. I start with an overview of the effects of epistemic
   injustice. After that, I spell out the powers of individual intellectual
   self-trust, then move from the role of communities for individual
   intellectual self-trust to collective intellectual self-trust, i.e.,
   intellectual self-trust of collectives. Finally, I outline the function
   of collective intellectual self-trust for obstructing and resisting
   epistemic injustice.}},

Abstract = {{Extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) represents one of the most widespread
   and effective cell therapies for graft-versus-host disease and other T
   cell-mediated disorders. However, the key factors affecting the
   therapeutic efficacy of ECP remain unclear. We hypothesized that
   therapeutic effects are mediated by ECP-treated antigen-presenting
   dendritic cells (DC). To test this hypothesis, we used the experimental
   model of contact hypersensitivity (CHS). The ECP's therapeutic activity
   improved when the total cell dose of the ECP-treated cells was
   increased. We used different haptens during sensitization to demonstrate
   that the anti-inflammatory activity of ECP is antigen-specific. This
   confirmed the hypothesis that professional antigen-presenting cells are
   involved in the mode of action. Also, the ECP's therapeutic activity was
   abrogated by the depletion of CD11c(+) DC, which represents fewer than
   1\% of all the ECP-exposed cells. Finally, we confirm the critical
   importance of CD11c(+) DC for ECP activity by showing that only a few
   purified CD11c(+) DC are sufficient to mediate its therapeutic effect.
   The finding that ECP-treated, physiological antigen-presenting DC alone
   mediate antigen-specific modulation of a pathological immune response
   may result in better-targeted interventions when treating patients.}},

Abstract = {{Peanut is widely grown and provides protein and edible oil for millions
   of people. Peanut growth and productivity are frequently negatively
   affected by abiotic and biotic environmental factors. However, the

   GmMYB3a was introduced into peanut plants by Agrobacterium-mediated
   transformation for the first time for thorough evaluation of the
   function of GmMYB3a in drought stress plant responses. We generated
   GmMYB3a-transgenic peanut plants. The GmMYB3a-overexpressing lines
   showed significantly improved physiological responses and no yield loss
   non-transgenic plants, in terms of survival rates. Thus, the
   GmMYB3a-overexpressing plants showed better photosynthetic performance,
   higher relative water content, and greater water use efficiency,
   demonstrating their adaptive capacity to water deficit. We conclude that
   overexpression of GmMYB3a can improve drought tolerance and productivity

Abstract = {{The cis-trans isomerization of a metal-centred molecular gear was
   investigated by density functional theory (DFT). The gear uses Pt(II) as
   stator, the azaphospha-triptycene as rotor, and the ligand introduces
   chlorine atoms. Under the conditions driven by light and heat, the gear
   can undergo switchable motion through the meshing and disengaging of two
   rotators. To be specific, the geometry optimization of
   cis-{[}PtCl2(Tp)(2)] and trans-{[}PtCl2(Tp)(2)] isomers were performed
   via the M06-2X functional in conjunction with def2-SVP basis set.
   Through rotating around the Pt-P single bond, the potential energy
   surface was scanned to explore the different rotational modes of the
   cis- and trans- isomers. In addition, time-dependent density functional
   theory (TD-DFT) was used to calculate molecular excitation energy and
   ultraviolet absorption properties. The reaction transition state of cis
   -> trans isomerization was calculated to study the isomerization process
   and the motion correlation between the two rotors during rotation.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Bipolar disorder is associated with increased rates of morbidity
   and mortality, magnified in women of childbearing age. The purpose of
   this paper is to provide an overview of the differential diagnosis and
   management of bipolar disorder in women of childbearing age.
   Conclusions Differential diagnoses for bipolar disorder include
   depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, trauma-related disorders,
   attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and personality disorders.
   Pharmacotherapeutic options for the treatment of bipolar disorder
   include lithium, anti-epileptic medications, and atypical
   antipsychotics. In regard to women of childbearing age, consideration of
   risks, benefits, and alternative therapies is needed before initiating
   therapy.
   Practice Implications Caring for patients with bipolar disorder,
   particularly women of childbearing age, requires careful differentiation
   of bipolar disorder from other mental health problems, and prudent
   consideration of pharmacotherapeutic options.}},

Title = {{Particle density determination using resonant mass measurement method
   combined with asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation method}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{1631}},
Month = {{NOV 8}},
Abstract = {{A novel characterization system using a combinational analysis of the
   resonant mass measurement (RMM) and asymmetrical flow field-flow
   fractionation (AF4) methods is developed as a hybrid analytical tool for
   the particle density of mixtures of different-sized materials. The
   function of the RMM method is to determine the particle mass by
   observing the shift in frequency proportional to the particle mass.
   However, to determine the density of particles using the RMM method,
   information on the size or size distribution is necessary. Because the
   size distribution of the particles could influence the accuracy of the
   determination of the density of the particles, this study addresses the
   weak point of the RMM method using the AF4 method. First, AF4 is used to
   fractionate the narrow-sized distributed particles as an effective
   sample preparation method before the RMM assessment. Moreover, the
   accurate size distribution determined by the AF4 method with multi-angle
   light scattering analysis supports the reliable density determination by
   the RMM method on the transformation from the mass distribution of the
   particles to the density distribution. Using our developed combinational
   analytical method of RMM and AF4 methods for mixed particle samples
   (different sizes and different materials), the densities of the
   respective particles are evaluated. This approach clearly resolved the
   problems of the RMM method using a combination analysis with the AF4
   method for RMM assessment on the density of particles. The investigated
   analysis method can have an important role in developing new
   applications of colloidal nano- and micro-materials in industrial and
   biological research. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction and objective Total hip arthroplasty with rectangular
   femoral component and transverse osteotomy for patients with Crowe type
   3 or 4 dysplasia yields successful results with varying radiological
   findings. This study aims to investigate the surgery and patient related
   factors associated with successful clinical and radiological results.
   Patients and methods Fifty hips of 41 patients were retrospectively
   examined. Length and percentage of the stem passing the osteotomy level
   and canal fill ratio were measured. Radiological findings such as
   radiolucent lines (RL) around the stem, hypertrophic callus or an
   identifiable osteotomy line on X-ray images were assessed. All clinical
   and radiological results were analyzed for any significant association.
   Results Mean stem length and percentage passing the osteotomy level were
   6.4 cm (+/- 0.7) and 51\% (+/- 6). Presence of an identifiable osteotomy
   line was positively associated with the increasing length of the stem
   passing the osteotomy level and with a lower HHS (p < 0.05). RL around
   the stem were associated with a lesser reduction in VAS score (p <
   0.05). Conclusion Rectangular femoral stem conveniently accommodate the
   proximal femur in severely dysplastic hips. An upper limit for the
   femoral stem exists to obtain better bony union and higher HHS. RL
   around the stem are clinically relevant and is associated with a worse
   VAS score at the latest follow-up.}},

Abstract = {{Background Excessive sunlight exposure leads to photodamaged skin,
   resulting in wrinkles, roughness, relaxation, and pigmentation. We
   examined photoprotective effects of aqueous extracts of dried Phragmites
   communis rhizome (PCWE) on ultraviolet B radiation (UVB)-mediated
   photodamage in skin cells. Methods Human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs),
   melanocytes (B16F10 cells), and keratinocytes (HaCaT cells) were treated
   with PCWE (25-200 mu g/mL), with or without UVB (30 mJ/cm(2)). Cell
   viability, cell senescence, and mRNA levels of genes involved in skin
   homeostasis were assessed. Anti-melanogenic effects of PCWE on B16F10
   cells were evaluated. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA levels and
   beta-hexosaminidase release were evaluated in macrophage RAW264.7 and
   basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells, respectively. Results No significant
   cytotoxicity was observed in tested cells up to 200 mu g/mL PCWE. In
   HDFs and HaCaT cells, PCWE pretreatment afforded significant,
   concentration-dependent photoprotection. PCWE downregulated baseline
   matrix metalloprotease-1 expression and elastase activity in HDFs; in
   HaCaT cells, telomerase reverse transcriptase and hyaluronan synthase-2
   expressions were upregulated. PCWE suppressed
   alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone-mediated increase in melanin
   production and tyrosinase activity. PCWE suppressed COX-2 induction (in
   RAW264.7) and beta-hexosaminidase release (in RBL-2H3). Conclusion PCWE
   exhibits good potential to attenuate photodamage in skin cells.}},

Title = {{Adaptive Meyer wavelet filters for machinery fault diagnosis based on
   harmonic infinite-taxicab norm and grasshopper optimization algorithm}},
Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART C-JOURNAL OF
   MECHANICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Abstract = {{Meyer wavelet filters are the key building blocks of empirical wavelet
   transform. In mechanical fault diagnosis, however, the boundaries of
   Meyer wavelet filters are usually defined empirically. In order to solve
   the problems, this paper proposes a new index called harmonic
   infinite-taxicab norm to guide grasshopper optimization algorithm to
   primarily optimize a band-pass filter and thus, concurrently and
   secondarily optimize a low-pass filter and a high-pass filter of Meyer
   wavelet. The proposed index is inspired by spectral Lp/Lq norm and it is
   closely related to fault characteristic frequency of rotating machinery.
   In addition, only three Meyer wavelet filters are demanded in each
   iteration of optimization. The effectiveness of the proposed method is
   validated by comparing with fast kurtogram method on analyzing faulty
   bearing data and gearbox data.}},

Abstract = {{Cell-derived microvesicles (MVs, also known as microparticles, MPs) are
   known as important biomarkers of various diseases including
   cardiovascular diseases, infectious diseases, and cancer. Development of
   techniques for blood cell removal and MV isolation is required for
   downstream analyses in biological and clinical applications. A
   sheathless, label-free, viscoelastic microfluidic device is proposed for
   the separation of submicrometer platelet-derived MPs (PDMPs) from whole
   blood. Flow rate and channel length dependent performance of the device
   is evaluated using 2-mu m particles as analogs to platelets and
   hematocrit (Hct) dependent flow characteristics of red blood cells
   (RBCs) are observed. In addition, the removal rate of nanoparticles of
   sizes 300, 500, 700, and 1000 nm is evaluated, and finally, the device
   is applied to examine the recovery of PDMPs from diluted whole blood
   sample. At Q = 200 mu L min(-1) in a 15-mm long microchannel, RBCs at
   5\% Hct and platelets are removed to the central outlet without platelet
   activation, while PDMPs are successfully isolated to the side outlets
   within approximate to 2 min. The PDMPs collected from the device are
   analyzed by flow cytometry. The device exhibits approximate to 4.8-fold
   enhanced isolation performance compared to the centrifugation method.}},

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{Owing to low-temperature deposition conditions and high deposition rate,
   cold spray offers unique advantages in manufacturing a wide variety of
   metallic and composite coatings including metal matrix composites
   produced from physically blended powders. One of the challenges of
   producing composite coatings using cold spray is the deviation of
   coatings composition from the blended feedstock powder composition. This
   is of utmost importance as it affects the composition and phase
   evolution of intermetallic forming coatings during post spray heat
   treatment. In this work, cold spray of composite Ni-Ti coatings and
   formation of intermetallics from post spray heat treatment were
   investigated as a first step to examine the potential of producing
   equiatomic bulk Ni-Ti by cold spray. Three different physically blended
   Ni and Ti powders mixtures were sprayed on titanium substrates to
   address the coating composition variation from the blended feedstock
   powder and study its influence on phase evolution during post spray heat
   treatment. High-density and well-dispersed composite coatings were
   achieved for each case. EDS analysis revealed as-sprayed coatings with
   10.5, 35.9 and 56.9 at.\% Ni (and with balanced Ti ratios) from the
   three powder mixtures. Annealing treatments were conducted at 400, 500
   and 900 degrees C for 1 and 2 h and comparative studies of the
   intermetallic compound formations were carried out. Microstructural
   investigation showed that all three equilibrium intermetallics phases of
   binary Ni-Ti phase diagram (Ni3Ti, Ti2Ni and NiTi) formed in the two
   Ni-rich composite coatings with NiTi phase being maximum in the coating
   with the closest composition to equiatomic ratio while only Ti2Ni phase
   formed in the Ti-rich coating after annealing. Thermal etching analysis
   of coatings showed that NiTi phase forms with a gradient microstructure
   from Ti splats boundary toward the center of splats, which is attributed
   to the grain refinement of CS samples at splat boundary and
   intermetallic nucleation mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{A spectrally accurate and very efficient algorithm suitable for
   prediction of pressure losses in heated grooved channels has been
   developed. Heating and topography patterns are used to create spatial
   flow modulations resulting in a pattern interaction problem. Search for
   combinations of patterns resulting in the reduction of pressure losses
   requires development of a very accurate and efficient algorithm. The
   proposed algorithm uses a combination of the Fourier expansions in the
   horizontal directions and the Chebyshev expansions in the vertical
   direction to provide a very good resolution of the near wall regions.
   The immersed boundary conditions (IBC) method is used to enforce flow
   boundary conditions at the geometrically irregular boundaries. The
   resulting gridless discretization can be easily adapted to handle a wide
   range of topography patterns. Various tests demonstrate that the
   algorithm delivers spectral accuracy and can provide machine level
   accuracy. Comparisons with the standard open-source codes based either
   on the finite volume or on the spectral element discretization
   demonstrate several orders of magnitude better efficiency of the
   proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the study was to compare the therapeutic efficacy of topical
   hyperbaric oxygen therapy alone vs a combination of physical methods
   including topical hyperbaric oxygen therapy, magnetotherapy and
   low-energy light therapy in the treatment of venous leg ulcers.
   Thirty-six patients were treated with topical oxygen hyperbaria and 29
   patients were treated with a combination of physical methods. The
   assessment of ulcer surface area with use of a planimetric method, pain
   intensity with use of Laitinen scale and quality of life by means of
   EuroQol scale were performed. In both groups a statistically significant
   (P < .05) reduction of ulcer surface area has been obtained, but in
   patients treated with combined physical therapy average percentage
   reduction of ulcer surface area (36.44\% +/- 11.04\%) was statistically
   significantly (P = .00001) bigger as compared to other group (13.65\%
   +/- 8.32\%). In both groups of patients statistically significant (P <
   .05) reduction of frequency and intensity of pain, reduced intake of
   analgesic drugs and reduction of limitations of physical activity, as
   well as statistically significant improvement of quality of life have
   been observed, but in patients treated with combined physical therapy an
   average increase in the score in EuroQoL scale (61.03 +/- 7.14) was
   statistically significantly (P = .00001) bigger as compared to other
   group (25.27 +/- 8.16). It was concluded that topical hyperbaric oxygen
   therapy alone and a combination of physical methods cause significant
   reduction of ulcer surface area, reduction of pain intensity, as well as
   improvement of the quality of life, but a combination of physical
   methods is more efficient.}},

Abstract = {{Schistosomiasis, caused by a blood fluke of the genus Schistosoma,
   afflicts over 230 million people worldwide. Treatment of the disease
   relies on just one drug, praziquantel. Cnicin (Cn) is the sesquiterpene
   lactone found in blessed thistle (Centaurea benedicta) that showed
   antiparasitic activities but has not been evaluated against Schistosoma.
   However, cnicin has poor water solubility, which may limit its
   antiparasitic activities. To overcome these restrictions, inclusion
   complexes with cyclodextrins may be used. In this work, we evaluated the
   in vitro and in vivo antischistosomal activities of cnicin and its
   complexes with beta-cyclodextrin (beta CD) and
   2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP beta CD) against Schistosoma
   mansoni. Cnicin were isolated from C. benedicta by chromatographic
   fractionation. Complexes formed by cnicin and beta CD (Cn/beta CD), as
   well as by cnicin and HP beta CD (Cn/HP beta CD), were prepared by
   coprecipitation and characterized. In vitro schistosomicidal assays were
   used to evaluate the effects of cnicin and its complexes on adult
   schistosomes, while the in vivo antischistosomal assays were evaluated
   by oral and intraperitoneal routes. Results showed that cnicin caused
   mortality and tegumental alterations in adult schistosomes in vitro,
   also showing in vivo efficacy after intraperitoneal administration. The
   oral treatment with cnicin or Cn/beta CD showed no significant worm
   reductions in a mouse model of schistosomiasis. In contrast, Cn/HP beta
   CD complex, when orally or intraperitoneally administered to S.
   mansoni-infected mice, decreased the total worm load, and markedly
   reduced the number of eggs, showing high in vivo antischistosomal
   effectiveness. Permeability studies, using Nile red, indicated that HP
   beta CD complex may reach the tegument of adult schistosomes in vivo.
   These results demonstrated the antischistosomal potential of cnicin in
   preparations with HP beta CD.}},

   education}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SPECIAL NEEDS EDUCATION}},
Abstract = {{This quasi-experimental study analyses the effects of an awareness
   intervention programme with five different branches designed to improve
   the attitudes of physical education (PE) students towards the inclusion
   of classmates with disabilities. The contact (yes/no) and its frequency
   (x1 vs. x3) with para-athletes, the duration of the programme (1 vs. 6/7
   sessions), and the provision of teaching strategies and materials
   (yes/no) were manipulated. The study involved 603 students aged 14-19
   from five public educational centres in southern Spain. Attitudes were
   assessed pre- and post-intervention with the Spanish version of the
   Children's Attitude towards Integrated Physical Education (general and
   specific subscales) and the Scale of Attitudes towards Students with
   Disabilities in PE. The three groups having contact with para-athletes
   during the interventions improved in the three attitude variables (p <
   0.05; -0.20 < d < -0.24). Pairwise comparisons of the improvement ratios
   also revealed several positive effects of the intervention duration and
   provision of teaching strategies (p < 0.05; -0.07 < d < 0.18). These
   findings could assist PE teachers in educating students to improve their
   knowledge and attitudes towards people with disabilities, having
   different strategies and resources to conduct awareness interventions
   based on para-sports in their regular PE classes.}},

Title = {{Crack identification in beam-type structural elements using a
   piezoelectric sensor.}},
Journal = {{NONDESTRUCTIVE TESTING AND EVALUATION}},
Abstract = {{A crack or any kind of damage induces a sharp discontinuity in the
   rotational displacement curve in a structure under load. However, if the
   beam is not loaded sufficiently or crack depth is very small, the
   discontinuity may not be possible to identify through conventional
   methods. This study proposes a non-destructive approach to reveal the
   presence of a crack in structural components based on the measurement of
   very small discontinuity in rotational displacement by employing a
   piezoelectric sensor (PZT). An analytical model of a statically loaded
   cracked beam with PZT attached to the beam is developed for various
   boundary conditions. The solution is obtained through Ritz
   approximation. Rotational displacements at different points along the
   length of the beam are determined. Subsequently, a finite element
   analysis on ABAQUS platform is carried out for comparison. The results
   obtained from these analyses are validated with the experimental data
   published in open literature. Two distinct techniques are employed to
   monitor the damage in slender and short length beams. the efficacy of
   the technique in the detection of small cracks in structure is
   established. It is also shown that the presence of multiple cracks in
   beams having various boundary conditions can be monitored by a single
   non-destructive investigation following the method.}},

Volume = {{61}},

Month = {{NOV 8}},
Abstract = {{We quantify the uncertainty of the momentum coefficient, C-mu, for six
   different experimental approaches. The approaches vary depending on
   compressibility effects and on the utilized acquisition equipment to
   measure the product of the mass flow rate with the jet exit velocity.
   The uncertainty of the directly-measured variables is propagated into
   the momentum coefficient using the Taylor expansion method to the first
   order. All relevant random and systematic uncertainties are meticulously
   quantified and listed. The analysis reveals unacceptably high
   uncertainty of the momentum coefficient under certain settings.
   Practical solutions to minimize the sources of uncertainty are then
   proposed and analyzed. The proposed improvements on the benchmark
   example of a Coanda actuator with a high aspect ratio slot reduce the
   uncertainty of C-mu significantly but not sufficiently, as it remains at
   a non-negligible value of similar to 11\% for the best scenario.
   Finally, a list of practical recommendations and guidelines on how to
   accurately estimate the momentum coefficient experimentally is provided.}},

Title = {{Beliefs about causal factors for suicide in rural Alaska Native
   communities and recommendations for prevention}},
Journal = {{TRANSCULTURAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Abstract = {{Rural Indigenous communities in Alaska suffer staggeringly high rates of
   suicide. In close-knit Alaska Native villages, each suicide leaves a
   trail of affected family and community members in its wake. This
   research aimed to understand community perceptions of what causes
   suicide in rural Alaska Native villages and generate recommendations for
   prevention strategies. In-depth interviews were conducted with 25 Alaska
   Native university students who moved from rural villages to an urban
   area to attend college. All had been profoundly affected by others'
   suicides and shared their beliefs about causal factors and
   recommendations for prevention efforts. Perceived causes included
   resistance to seeking help or discussing personal problems, loss of
   culture, traumatic experiences, geographical and social isolation, lack
   of opportunity, substance abuse, and exposure to others' suicides.
   Participants believed that suicide is preventable and recommended
   multi-level approaches to address suicide disparities. They provided
   recommendations for potentially effective and culturally appropriate
   prevention strategies, including increasing cultural and social
   connections, educating community members about mental health, and
   increasing accessibility of counseling services/reducing barriers to
   mental health services utilization.}},

Journal = {{HYDROBIOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{848}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{431-443}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Shallow lakes can change states in response to manipulations of top
   predators. In most reported experiments, the top piscivore has been a
   fish. However, low-latitude lakes typically support non-piscine
   piscivores, including mammals, birds, and reptiles. The roles of these
   groups have been little investigated, and whether they are more
   important as piscivores than fish remains unknown. We report both a
   longitudinal (2001-2018) and a cross-sectional (2012) study of the bird,
   caiman, and giant otter populations of floodplain lakes in Peru's Manu
   National Park. We compare the three groups, after removing the effects
   of taxonomic status and body mass, using allometric equations to
   estimate the field metabolic rate (FMR) for each group in each lake.
   Giant otters emerge as the dominant piscivore in lakes that support a
   resident family, with an energy requirement more than twice that of
   piscivorous birds and more than seven times that of caiman. However,
   giant otters were resident in only eight of 27 surveyed lakes. Indirect
   evidence suggests that these eight lakes are more productive than lakes
   not occupied by otters. The fact that lakes occupied by otters are
   dominated by phytoplankton suggests an underlying five-tiered trophic
   structure in keeping with the prominence of alternating levels in the
   structure of food webs.}},

Title = {{Optimization of Parameters for Alkali Pretreatment on Coir Fiber for
   Biomass Production Using TOPSIS.}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NATURAL FIBERS}},
Abstract = {{Coir is a lignocellulosic fiber which is quite preferable in the
   production of biofuels and chemicals. Conversion of cellulose and
   hemicellulose to biofuels requires five main unit processes out of
   which, pretreatment plays a major role because all subsequent processes
   depend upon the pretreatment results. Partial degradation of lignin,
   hemicellulose, and breakdown of the sugars also occur during the
   pretreatment of the coir. So, the optimal condition selection is vital.
   In this paper, an attempt has been made to optimize the parameters
   (time, NaOH concentration, and temperature) by Box-Behnken design in
   order to get the optimum level of lignin, hemicellulose, and cellulose.
   To obtain an ideal solution, the Technique for Order of Preference by
   Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is used to rank the optimized
   solutions. Further, to find the authenticity of TOPSIS, the top three
   ranked solutions are again tested. It is observed that error percentage
   increases with an increase in rank order.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Objectives 5-Aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) is a
   porphyrin-based photosensitizer and has been used for photodynamic
   therapy of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). In this study,
   photodetection and safety of 5-ALA-induced porphyrin in CIN tissues were
   assessed.
   Study Design/Materials and Methods A total of 42 patients for whom
   colposcopy or loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) was planned
   were administered 10\%, 20\%, or 30\% 5-ALA locally on the surface of
   the cervix for 1.5-18 hours. At different times after application, the
   fluorescence intensity of 5-ALA-induced porphyrin on CIN and non-CIN
   lesions of the cervix was detected.
   Results Fluorescence intensity was correlated with drug concentration
   and application time. With 20\% 5-ALA, the porphyrin fluorescence
   intensity increased over time, reaching a peak after 6 hours of
   application intervals in CIN. There was no significant difference in
   fluorescence intensity between CIN lesions and chronic cervicitis
   (benign tissue) or among CIN lesions of different severities. Three
   adverse events were considered related to the drug; however, these had
   no significant correlation with the drug concentration or application
   time.
   Conclusions 5-ALA at 10\%-30\% concentration is safe in patients with
   CIN. For further treatment, we recommend the application of 20\% 5-ALA,
   6 hours before photodynamic therapy in CIN.

Abstract = {{There may exist a connection between Echinococcus granulosus infection
   and cancer development. Here, it is aimed to investigate specific
   effects of E. granulosus protoscoleces (PSCs) on the proliferation and
   invasion capacities of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells in vitro and
   ex vitro. HepG2 cells were cultured with different quantities of E.
   granulosus PSCs in vitro. MTT analysis was used to evaluate effects of
   E. granulosus PSCs on the proliferation of HepG2 cells. Besides, scratch
   and transwell assays were respectively used for the detection of HepG2
   cells migration and invasion capacities after co-culture with E.
   granulosus PSCs. Then, HepG2 cells were subcutaneously transplanted into
   nude mice with or without E. granulosus PSCs. From the 25th day of
   transplantation, the volume of subcutaneous lesions was measured every
   four days. At the 37th day, subcutaneous lesions were removed and their
   weight was evaluated. H\&E staining was used for detecting basic
   pathological changes. HepG2 cells grew well without obvious
   morphological changes. Proliferation rate and migration capacity of
   HepG2 cells were higher in the co-culture group than the control group,
   which was closely associated with quantities of E. granulosus PSCs and
   co-culture time length. Moreover, HepG2 cells co-cultured with E.
   granulosus PSCs had stronger invasion ability than the control HepG2
   cells. Importantly, there existed significant differences in the volume
   and weight of subcutaneous lesions after transplanting HepG2 cells with
   E. granulosus PSCs than the control group. HepG2 cells were also more
   pathologically heterogeneous in morphology after transplantation with E.
   granulosus PSCs. Thus, E. granulosus PSCs may promote proliferation and
   invasion of HCC cells.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Does performing total joint arthroplasty in the afternoon or
   evening increase the rate of early prosthetic joint infection and the
   likelihood of early prosthetic joint infection? Methods We evaluated
   patients retrospectively, who underwent primary total hip (THA) or knee
   arthroplasty (TKA) between January 2016 and December 2019, met the
   inclusion criteria and had at least 90 days of follow-up. Patients were
   divided into two groups. Group I consisted of patients whose surgeries
   had been started and finished before 14:00, and group II included
   patients whose surgeries started after 14:01. All patients were operated
   after non-septic cases in specific orthopedic operating rooms. Their
   demographic data and comorbidities were noted. Primary outcome was to
   compare the risk of PJI between the groups. Results Group I and group II
   included 2309 and 1881 patients. Total number of patients with the
   diagnosis of PJI was 58 (1.4\%). It was 31 (1.3\%) and 27 (1.4\%),
   respectively (p = 0.79). Performing total joint arthroplasty after 14:01
   did not increase likelihood of infection (p = 0.83, OR 1.03). Among the
   parameters, PJI was significantly associated with age (p < 0.01, OR
   0.99), smoking status (p < 0.01, OR 0.15) and operating time (p = 0.04,
   OR 0.99) in TKA and with direct anterior approach (p = 0.02, OR 4.72) in
   THA. Age (p = 0.06, OR 1.03) was the factor affecting the risk of
   subsequent PJI after total joint arthroplasty. Conclusion Performing
   total joint arthroplasty in the afternoon or in the evening, after
   aseptic cases does not increase the risk of subsequent of PJI.}},

Abstract = {{Urban heat islands (UHIs) are a key topic in urban climate studies.
   However, systematic criteria for UHI comparisons were lacking prior to
   2012, when the concept of Local Climate Zones (LCZs) was introduced. By
   relating remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) to LCZs, we
   explored the applicability of LCZs in surface urban heat island (SUHI)
   investigations and compared the LST variation within and among LCZs for
   the Austin, San Antonio, and Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan areas in
   Texas, United States. Landsat 8 images from one summer and one winter
   day in 2015 were used to obtain LSTs to measure and model SUHIs. LCZs
   that were characterized by different land covers had the greatest LST
   variations, and LCZs that were further characterized by various urban
   morphological properties (including building density and height of
   roughness) also showed significant LST differences. Moreover, LCZ 9
   (sparsely built), LCZ 10 (heavy industry), LCZ D (low plants), LCZ E
   (bare rock or paved), and LCZ F (bare soil or sand) tended to contribute
   to contradictory heating/cooling effects in different metropolitan
   areas, primarily due to the spatial arrangement and geographic locations
   of LCZs. The close association between LCZs and LST demonstrates that
   LCZs are valuable for comparative analysis of the SUHI phenomenon
   between different cities and can be helpful for examination of the
   evolution of SUHIs over time. Our findings further suggest that
   understanding the spatial distribution of LCZs can benefit the
   development of mitigation strategies for SUHIs.}},

   waterpipe smoking among undergraduate medical and nursing students in
   Jordan.Method: A descriptive cross sectional design with 505 students
   from nursing and medical faculties in two Jordanian
   universities.Results: Students perceived waterpipe smoking as less
   harmful to health and not as addictive as cigarette smoking. One third
   were waterpipe smokers, with rates higher among males. There were
   significant differences in risk perceptions and behaviors of waterpipe
   smoking amongst nursing and medical students. 16.9\% of medical students
   versus 7.2\% of nursing students reported that nicotine in waterpipe is
   less than that in cigarettes (p<0.002). Overall, students who smoke
   waterpipe daily were over 30 times more likely to report dependence than
   those who did not smoke daily.Conclusions: A number of public health
   control measures should be initiated and enforced in places where
   waterpipe smoking is practiced including those that are currently in

Abstract = {{The paper investigates whether productivity growth is affected by the
   rate of growth of income and by that of employment for a representative
   sample of Latin American countries from the 1980s to the early 2010s.
   Having post-Kaleckian models as background, the paper empirically
   assesses the relationship between these variables, which are believed to
   be behind the underdeveloped trap, low productivity growth, high income
   concentration and low-income growth. The results show a positive impact
   of the rate of growth of income over productivity, the so called
   Kaldor-Verdoorn coefficient. However, the vast majority of the sample,
   the effect of employment growth on productivity growth was not
   significant. The latter results are consistent to the interpretation
   offered by the Latin American Structuralist School, who has long argued
   that one of the hallmarks of underdetermine is uneven spread of the
   productivity gains though the economy. This is the framework used to
   interpret the results.}},

Abstract = {{We present a numerical model that describes the microfluidic generation
   and manipulation of ferrofluid droplets under an external magnetic
   field. We developed a numerical Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
   analysis for predicting and optimizing continuous flow generation and
   processing of ferrofluid droplets with and without the presence of a
   permanent magnet. More specifically, we explore the dynamics of
   oil-based ferrofluid droplets within an aqueous continuous phase under
   an external inhomogeneous magnetic field. The developed model determines
   the effect of the magnetic field on the droplet generation, which is
   carried out in a flow-focusing geometry, and its sorting in T-junction
   channels. Three-channel depths (25 mu m, 30 mu m, and 40 mu m) were
   investigated to study droplet deformation under magnetic forces. Among
   the three, the 30 mu m channel depth showed the most consistent droplet
   production for the studied range of flow rates. Ferrofluids with
   different loadings of magnetic nanoparticles were used to observe the
   behavior for different ratios of magnetic and hydrodynamic forces. Our
   results show that the effect of these factors on droplet size and
   generation rate can be tuned and optimized to produce consistent droplet
   generation and sorting. This approach involves fully coupled
   magnetic-fluid mechanics models and can predict critical details of the
   process including droplet size, shape, trajectory, dispensing rate, and
   the perturbation of the fluid co-flow for different flow rates. The
   model enables better understanding of the physical phenomena involved in
   continuous droplet processing and allows efficient parametric analysis
   and optimization.}},

Abstract = {{Mono (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) is a major metabolite of di
   (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). This study aimed to observe the toxic
   effect of MEHP on human endometrial microvascular endothelial cells
   (HEMECs) and its potential molecular mechanism. HEMECs were exposed to
   different concentrations of MEHP (0, 50, 100, and 200 nM). Cell
   viability and apoptosis were assessed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and
   flow cytometry assays. Western blot was performed to examine the
   expression of apoptosis-related proteins (Bcl-2, Bax, and Caspase-3).
   Moreover, the expression of pyroptosis-related Caspase-1 was detected by
   western blot and immunofluorescence assays. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
   release levels were evaluated in HEMECs treated with MEHP and/or
   Caspase-1 inhibitor Ac-YVAD-CHO. After exposure to MEHP, NLRP3
   expression was examined by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase
   chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot. LDH release and apoptosis
   levels were tested in HEMECs induced by MEHP and/or siNLRP3. MEHP
   significantly induced cell viability and inhibited apoptosis for HEMECs,
   with a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, Bcl-2/Bax ratio was
   distinctly reduced and Caspase-3 expression was increased in HEMECs
   after exposure to MEHP. Western blot and immunofluorescence results
   confirmed that MEHP markedly augmented Caspase-1 expression in HEMECs.
   Furthermore, LDH release levels were fortified in HEMECs treated with
   MEHP, which were improved following cotreatment with Ac-YVAD-CHO. At the
   mRNA and protein levels, NLRP3 expression was prominently increased in
   HEMECs exposed to MEHP. NLRP3 knockdown markedly ameliorated the
   increase in LDH release and apoptosis induced by MEHP exposure in
   HEMECs. Our findings suggested that exposure to MEHP facilitates
   apoptosis and pyroptosis of HEMECs through NLRP3 inflammasome.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how invasive predators impact native species is essential
   for the development of effective control strategies, especially in
   insular environments where alternative non-native prey species exist. We
   examined seasonal and spatial shifts in diet of feral cat Felis
   silvestris catus focusing on the predation on native streaked
   shearwaters, Calonectris leucomelas, and introduced rats, Rattus rattus
   and R. norvegicus, which are alternative prey to shearwaters, on Mikura
   Island, Japan. Streaked shearwaters breed at low elevations on the
   island from spring to autumn, whereas rats inhabit the island throughout
   the year, which makes them an alternative prey when native shearwaters
   are absent. Fecal analysis revealed that feral cats dramatically shifted
   their diets from introduced rats in winter to streaked shearwaters in
   seabird-season in low elevation areas of the island, while cats preyed
   on rats throughout the year at high altitudes on the island. This
   finding suggests that feral cats selectively prey on shearwaters. This
   is probably because of their large body size and less cautious behavior,
   and because introduced rats sustain the cat population when shearwaters
   are absent. The number of streaked shearwaters killed was estimated to
   be 313 individuals per cat per year, which represents an indication of
   top-down effects of feral cats on streaked shearwaters. Further studies
   on the demographic parameters and interspecific interactions of the
   three species are required to enable effective cat management for the
   conservation of streaked shearwaters on this island.}},

Abstract = {{The behaviour and diet of the Tasman parakeet (Cyanoramphus cookii) have
   not been quantitively described. We quantified the relative frequency of
   behaviours and diversity of food items for the species during autumn and
   winter to help refine the current management of the species. We also
   collected information on the availability of one of their main foods:
   niau (Rhopalostylis baueri) fruits. Parakeets fed on fruit pulp and
   seeds of eight plant species. Niau fruits represented 44\% of total
   feeding bouts indicating that this is an important food item during the
   autumn-winter period. The most common behavioural state during our
   observations was feeding (30\% of behavioural states). Our estimate of
   niau fruit availability in the core area of Tasman parakeet occurrence
   indicates approximately 1.2 million fruits during the peak of fruiting
   in spring. Tasman parakeets are generalists, but niau fruits represent
   an abundant and important resource. Although niau are common and produce
   large quantities of fruit, introduced rats (Rattus spp.), potentially
   represent significant competitors to Tasman parakeets, because they also
   feed on niau fruits. Ongoing control of rats is thus critical to
   maintain large quantities of native fruits to sustain a growing
   population of Tasman parakeets.}},

   and the propyl-modified ortho-phenylenediamine, the probe NP1 and NP2
   based on naphthalimide fluorophore exhibited the turn-on fluorescence
   response for the detection of FA. In particular, the probe NP2 with the
   greater steric hindrance presented superior specificity for imaging the

   as-prepared Mo-VC@GC exhibits enhanced electrocatalytic activity
   compared with the VC@GC counterpart, with a lower overpotential of 198
   mV (VC@GC: 324 mV) to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm(-2), a
   smaller Tafel slope of 169 mV dec(-1) (VC@GC: 209 mV dec(-1)), along
   with outstanding long-term durability for at least 80 h, and similar to
   100\% HER yield in 1 M KOH solution. The remarkable electrocatalytic
   performance of Mo-VC@GC can be attributed to the desirable electronic
   structures and crystallinity regulated by Mo-doping, the unique
   ultrafine VC nanostructures with abundant exposed active sites, and
   atomically thin graphitic nanocarbon with high conductivity as a
   support.}},

Title = {{Teacher education for inclusive education in Bhutan: perspectives of
   pre-service and beginning teachers}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INCLUSIVE EDUCATION}},
Abstract = {{Bhutan is in the preliminary stages of training teachers to support
   inclusive education. This study investigated teachers' views on
   preparation for inclusive teaching using a case study that was conducted
   with twelve pre-service and twenty beginning teachers in six schools.
   Data were drawn from focus-group interviews and open-ended
   questionnaires. The application of Vygotsky's social cultural theory and
   Bandura's self-efficacy theory was appropriate and acknowledged the
   social systems surrounding learning. Socio-cultural theorisation was
   used to consider where people lived, and social and cultural factors;
   while self-efficacy theory enabled an exploration of teachers'
   willingness to implement inclusiveness. Findings are presented in four
   key areas: education for all, barriers, policy and attitudes towards
   inclusion. This study contributes to inclusive education research in
   South-West Asia and policy goals and practice in Bhutan.}},

Title = {{Design and methodology of the Aging Nephropathy Study (AGNES): a
   prospective cohort study of elderly patients with chronic kidney disease}},
Journal = {{BMC NEPHROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Renal replacement therapy (RRT) is usually indicated for
   patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) with glomerular filtration
   rate below 10 ml/ml/min/1.73m(2). However, the need for RRT and timing
   of dialysis initiation are debatable for patients aged 70 years or
   older. We here describe the study design and methodology of the Aging
   Nephropathy Study (AGNES) protocol that aims at evaluating to what
   extent geriatric-related conditions such as frailty, cognitive
   dysfunction, and presence of comorbidities have an impact on survival
   and RRT initiation in this group of patients. In this manuscript we
   provide detailed information about the AGNES study design and
   methodology.
   Methods: AGNES is a prospective observational cohort that aim to
   investigate clinical, biochemical and demographic factors associated
   with RRT initiation and mortality of patients with CKD stage 4 or 5 who
   are aged 70 years and older. We plan to include 200 patients over 5
   years. Clinically stable outpatients on conservative management for at
   least 6 months will be recruited from the Nephrogeriatric Clinic at the
   Hospital das Clinicas da Universidade de Sao Paulo, Brazil. Eligible
   patients are submitted to a full clinical examination, geriatric
   assessment, and blood test at baseline. Following the baseline visit the
   patients are being monitored during an observational follow up period of
   at least 12 months during which patients will be contacted in the clinic
   at their regular follow up or by phone until either RRT initiation or
   death occurs. This cohort includes evaluation of cognition by the
   education-adjusted 10-point Cognitive Screener (10-CS), frailty by Fried
   index score, a complete nutritional assessment (by body composition
   assessment, global subjective assessment and dietary intake),
   comorbidities by Charlson comorbidity index and biochemical markers
   including FGF-23 and Klotho.
   Discussion: The AGNES cohort, a real-world study of current clinical
   practice in elderly patients with advanced CKD prior to dialysis
   initiation, will shed light into progression of CKD and its
   complications, indications of RRT and factors determining survival. This
   investigation will elucidate to what extent geriatric conditions,
   nutritional status and clinical factors are associated with survival,
   quality of life and RRT initiation in elderly CKD patients not yet on
   dialysis.}},

Abstract = {{Palladium (Pd) is widely used in automotive catalytic converters to
   reduce toxic gas emissions. The input of Pd in the rainfall-runoff is an
   important contributing factor to the accumulation of Pd in receiving
   water bodies. In this study, the Meishe River in Haikou, Hainan
   Province, China, was used as the research area, and palladium (Pd) was
   selected as the target pollutant. This study explored the response of Pd
   in the receiving water body to rainfall-runoff and to analyze the
   influencing factors. The results showed that the dissolved Pd
   concentration in the receiving water body had a corresponding
   relationship with that in rainfall-runoff. The response of suspended Pd
   in the receiving water body to rainfall-runoff was closely related to
   the location of the drainage outlet. Compared with that of suspended Pd,
   the response of dissolved Pd in the receiving water body to that in the
   rainfall-runoff was more obvious. Seven meters downstream from the
   outfall was the most sensitive response distance of dissolved Pd in
   receiving water bodies to rainfall-runoff, and the response time was
   approximately 0-10 min. The suspended Pd at 3 m downstream from the
   outfall also had a certain response to the rainfall-runoff, and the
   response time was approximately 15-25 min. The response time of the
   suspended Pd in the receiving water body depended largely on the first
   flush ability of the runoff. There was a moderately positive correlation
   between the dissolved Pd and Cl- in the receiving water body (r = 0.687;
   p < 0.05). The effects of pH, Eh, and total suspended solids (TSS) on
   suspended Pd were reduced in the response process of the receiving water
   body. The synergistic effect of multiple factors increased the
   uncertainty of the Pd response.}},

Abstract = {{Background Somatosensory temporal discrimination is abnormal in dystonia
   and reflects reduced somatosensory inhibition. In healthy individuals,
   both the latter are enhanced by high-frequency repetitive somatosensory
   stimulation, whereas opposite effects are observed in patients with
   cervical dystonia.
   Objectives We tested whether low-frequency repetitive sensory
   stimulation, which in healthy individuals worsens discrimination, might
   have the opposite effect in patients with cervical dystonia at the
   physiological level and, in turn, improve their perceptual performance.
   Methods Somatosensory temporal discrimination and several
   electrophysiological measures of sensorimotor inhibition were collected
   before and after 45 minutes of low-frequency repetitive sensory
   stimulation.
   Results As predicted, and opposite to what happened in controls,
   low-frequency repetitive sensory stimulation in patients enhanced
   sensorimotor inhibition and normalized somatosensory temporal
   discrimination.
   Conclusions Patients with cervical dystonia have an abnormal response to
   repetitive sensory stimulation, which we hypothesize is attributed to
   abnormally sensitive homeostatic mechanisms of inhibitory circuitry in
   both sensory and motor systems. (c) 2020 International Parkinson and

Abstract = {{We use a variety of computational methods to characterize and compare
   the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and epoxidation reaction pathways for
   oxidation of cyclohexene by an iron(iv)-oxo complex. Previous B3LYP
   calculations have led to predictions that both alcohol (from the HAT
   route) and epoxide should be formed in similar amounts, which was not in
   agreement with experiment where only the HAT product was observed. We
   show here that ab initio calculations which can take both static and
   dynamic correlation into account are needed to explain the
   experimentally observed dominance of the HAT process. Since these
   systems do not have very strong multireference character we have also
   tested different flavours of local coupled cluster methods. We suggest
   that further improvements are necessary before they can provide highly
   accurate results for these systems.}},

Title = {{The dynamical interplay of perinatal leptin with birthweight and 3-month
   weight, in full-term, preterm, IUGR mother-infant dyads}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERNAL-FETAL \& NEONATAL MEDICINE}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   To evaluate the dynamical interplay between perinatal leptin
   concentrations and neonatal weight evolution until 3 months of age.
   Methods
   In a prospective observational study, maternal, cord blood and neonatal
   plasma leptin concentrations were correlated to birthweight and 3-month
   weight in 26 full-term, 20 preterm, and 17 intrauterine growth
   restriction (IUGR) mother-neonate couples.
   Results
   The median of maternal, cord blood, neonatal leptin concentrations were
   significantly different among the three groups (p = 0.010; <0.001;
   =0.041 correspondingly). In the respect of the full-term group, higher
   concentrations were reported in preterm and IUGR mothers and lower
   concentrations in cord blood and neonatal plasma. The post-hoc
   comparisons showed that maternal concentrations were significantly
   higher in the IUGR group (p = 0.005 vs full-term), cord blood
   concentrations resulted always significantly lower (preterm, IUGR vs
   full-term p < 0.001) and neonatal concentrations were significantly
   lower in the preterm group (p = 0.018 vs full-term). Neonatal
   birthweight and 3-month weight were always significantly different among
   groups (p < 0.001), even if preterm and IUGR still had lower weight than
   full-term, the percent increasing of weight between birth and 3-month
   demonstrated that preterm and IUGR infants have grown significantly
   faster, (preterm, IUGR vs full-term p < 0.001). The univariable analysis
   showed a maternal leptin association with offspring' birthweight (R =
   -38\%, p = 0.006) and with 3-month weight (R = -43\%, p = 0.002).
   Accounting for confounders, these associations lost significance. Cord
   blood leptin concentrations positively correlated with birthweight and
   with 3-month weight (both, p < 0.001). The latter correlation, when
   adjusting for birthweight became negative (R = -43\% p < 0.001).
   Conclusion
   Our results showed that maternal leptin levels lost their influence on
   neonatal weight when considering confounders. At 3-month, once
   birthweight adjusted, the percent increasing of weight was statistically
   larger in preterm and IUGR than the full-term group and the correlation
   between cord blood leptin and weight turned negative, from positive at
   birth. These data may be a clue for further investigation on the
   relationship between perinatal leptin concentrations and catch-up
   growth.}},

Title = {{Supramolecular chiral surface of nickel sulfate hexahydrate crystals and
   its ability to chirally recognize enantiomers by adsorption data}},

Abstract = {{The cause of chiral symmetry breaking, leading to the chirality of all
   living things, remains one of the mysteries of chemistry. One possible
   source of inducing chirality may be enantiomorphic crystals. The surface
   of such crystals does not have chirality centers; however, it has
   supramolecular chirality. In this work, we evaluated the ability of the
   surface of nickel sulfate hexahydrate crystals, obtained under Viedma
   ripening conditions, for chiral recognition. For this,
   enantiomer-adsorption on the surface of alpha-NiSO4 center dot 6H(2)O
   crystals was studied. To obtain adsorption isotherms, two approaches
   were used: adsorption from solutions and vapor adsorption under inverse
   gas chromatography conditions. It was found that the initial regions of
   the adsorption isotherms of the enantiomers coincide. At the same time,
   at high adsorbate concentrations, a significant difference in adsorption
   isotherms was observed. In the case of menthol adsorption from solutions
   in n-heptane, it was found that the difference in adsorption isotherms
   was observed in the range of 0.75 < theta < 1.75. The ability of the
   studied surface to cause chiral separation under the conditions of both
   gas and liquid chromatography was found. It was concluded that in the
   case of the alpha-NiSO4 center dot 6H(2)O supramolecular chiral surface,
   the recognition of enantiomers is possible when an enantiomer layer is
   formed on it, i.e., the chirality of the supramolecular level turned out
   to be capable of recognizing the chirality of only the same level. The
   occurrence of similar processes of enantiomer adsorption on
   enantiomorphic crystals under Archean Earth conditions could be the
   cause of global chiral symmetry breaking.}},

Abstract = {{The CUSUM (C) charts are well recognized as a potentially advanced
   process monitoring tools because of their sensitivity against small and
   moderate shifts. In this paper, we first improve the sensitivity of the
   Brownian motion-based C (BC) chart with an appropriate transformation,
   named new BC (NBC) chart, for monitoring moderate and large shifts in
   the mean of a normal process. Then, using the control charting structure
   of the Crosier C (CC) chart, we propose the NBCC (NBC with CC structure)
   chart. In addition, for efficiently detecting a mean shift within an
   interval, dual version of these control charts are also proposed, named
   the dual NBC (DNBC) and dual NBCC (DNBCC) charts. Moreover, the fast
   initial response feature is also incorporated into the proposed charts.
   Using the Monte Carlo simulation, the run length properties of the
   proposed charts are computed. The run length performances of the
   existing and proposed charts are compared using the extra quadratic loss
   and integral relative average run length as performance criterion. It
   turns out that the NBC and NBCC (DNBC and DNBCC) charts are uniformly
   more sensitive than the C, CC, and NBC (dual C and dual CC) charts when
   detecting the mean shifts in small, moderate, and large intervals, where
   the DNBCC chart outperforms all considered charts. The proposed charts
   are also applied on real data sets to support the proposed theory.}},

Abstract = {{Combining catalysts is not a recent concept. For several decades, it has
   enabled the development of processes that are more economical in terms
   of solvents, energy, and carbon emissions. This strategy leads the way
   in current catalytic research aiming to reduce the impact of the
   chemical industry on the environment and replace synthetic routes based
   on petroleum with those based on biomass. In particular, hybrid
   catalysis, consisting of the integrated combination of several catalysts
   of different types, often a chemical and bio-catalyst, represents one of
   the most promising innovations in the field, especially when the two
   catalysts are combined in a single multicatalytic material. Several
   examples of such achievements have already been reported; however, these
   are rare compared to single-type catalyst combinations. It is important
   to understand the issues that govern hybrid catalysis to overcome the
   obstacles affecting its implementation, starting with the difficulties
   of communication between scientists of different fields. To surmount
   this barrier, this article proposes a new naming system for
   multicatalytic processes and reactions to unify common terms describing
   the same concepts. This system allows for the comparison of
   multicatalytic systems developed in both chemistry and biology and
   highlights their differences, similarities, and limitations. Hybrid
   catalysis is a rapidly expanding interdisciplinary field that builds on
   the developments from both the field of catalysis and materials science.
   Although the number of synthetic examples is limited, they are growing
   exponentially using the latest innovative materials for the production
   of multicatalytic materials for use in optimized ``one-pot/one-step{''}
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundMetastatic germ cell cancer of the testis is characterized by
   favorable prognosis since effective treatment methods are available even
   in cases of extensive disease. Retroperitoneal masses frequently
   encroach major blood vessels requiring a vascular intervention usually
   performed in association with the post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal
   lymph node dissection (RPLND). Reported clinical case describes a
   successful pre-treatment endovascular surgery for abdominal aortic
   rupture allowing for full-dose systemic chemotherapy administration, and
   subsequent radical surgical intervention at primary tumor site as well
   as metastatic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection including the
   reconstruction of inferior caval vein.Case presentationPatient presented
   with left-sided testicular tumor and voluminous retroperitoneal mass
   with vascular involvement. Soon after the patient had been admitted for
   the first cycle of cisplatin-based chemotherapy, computed tomographic
   angiography (CTA) revealed a dorsal aortic wall rupture with active
   extravasation and irregular pseudoaneurysmatic dilatation of the aorta
   below the leak area. Retroperitoneal intratumoral hemorrhage associated
   with the bilateral iliac venous thrombosis required an endovascular
   repair procedure of infrarenal abdominal aorta.ConclusionsFollowing the
   successful endovascular aortic repair 3 cycles of BEP (bleomycin,
   etoposide, cisplatin) regimen were administered with subsequent delayed
   left radical orchiectomy and RPLND associated with vena cava inferior
   (VCI) resection. Reconstruction of VCI was originally not deemed
   necessary as collateral blood flow appeared sufficient, however,
   intraoperative complications resulted in the need for unilateral VCI
   reconstruction, using the interposed bypass between right common iliac
   vein and infrarenal segment of VCI. Histopathologic examination of the
   attained specimen detected no vital cancer structures. The patient
   remains disease-free 18 months after the RPLND.}},

Title = {{Rational guidewire use in the coronary chronic total occlusion
   interventions}},
Journal = {{EGYPTIAN HEART JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Procedures for coronary chronic total occlusion (CTO) are
   still a clinical challenge with relatively lower success rates. Recent
   advances in the biotechnology and introduction of CTO-dedicated
   guidewires have increased the procedural success rate of CTO
   interventions. Herein, we aimed to reveal the clinical and angiographic
   predictors of the crossability of the initial guidewire choice and
   rational guidewire usage in CTO interventions. A total of 177 patients
   with an indication for a coronary CTO procedure were included in this
   study. The use of 1-3 guidewires and crossing of the CTO lesion with the
   initial guidewire choice was defined as rational guidewire usage. The
   CTO lesions were classified according to the Japanese chronic total
   occlusion registry (J-CTO) and EuroCTO scores for evaluating the
   difficulty of the procedures. Then, a statistical analysis was performed
   to assess the initial guidewire choice, crossability, and contributors
   to rational guidewire usage.
   Results: The mean J-CTO score was 1.42 +/- 1.16, and the mean EuroCTO
   score was 1.44 +/- 1.18. The success rate of the procedures was 90.4\%.
   The initial guidewire choice crossed the lesion in 44.1\% of the cases,
   in which 1-3 guidewires were used (82.1\%). The crossability of the
   polymeric and moderate stiff tip guidewires was higher (82.1\% and
   64.1\%, respectively), and the Pilot series was the most successful
   brand (36.2\%). Logistic regression analysis confirmed that J-CTO score,
   procedural technique, guidewire type, and stiffness of the tip were the
   major predictors of rational guidewire usage.
   Conclusion: Our analysis showed that the use of polymeric and moderate
   stiff tip guidewires, particularly the Pilot brand, were associated with
   rational guidewire usage in easy and intermediate difficulty CTO cases.}},

Title = {{Ubiquity of complex coacervation of DNA and proteins in aqueous solution}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{41}},
Pages = {{9525-9533}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{We report complex coacervation between a primarily hydrophobic protein,
   elastin, and a strong polyanion DNA (2 kbp) in aqueous and salty
   solutions at room temperature, 25 degrees C. The associative interaction
   at fixed elastin and varying DNA concentration, thereby maintaining a
   mixing ratio of r = {[}DNA] : {[}elastin] = 0.0027 to 0.093, was probed.
   What distinguishes this study from protein-DNA coacervation reported
   earlier is that the protein used here was mostly a hydrophobic
   polyampholyte with low linear charge density, and its complementary
   polyelectrolyte, DNA, concentration was chosen to be extremely small
   (1-35 ppm). The interaction profile was found to be strongly
   hierarchical in the mixing ratio, defined by three distinct regions: (i)
   Region I (r < 0.02) was defined as the onset of primary binding leading
   to condensation of DNA; (ii) Region II (0.02 < r < 0.08) indicated
   secondary binding which led to the formation of fully charge neutralized
   complexes signaling the onset of coacervation; and (iii) Region III
   (0.08 < r < 0.12) revealed growth of insoluble complexes of large size
   facilitating liquid-solid phase separation. The degree of complex
   coacervation was suppressed in the presence of a monovalent salt
   implying that screened Coulomb interactions governed the binding. Small
   angle neutron scattering data attributed an amorphous structure to the
   coacervates. The elastin-DNA system belongs to a rare class of
   interacting biopolymers where very weak electrostatic interactions may
   drive coacervation, thereby implying that coacervation between DNA and
   proteins may be ubiquitous.}},

Abstract = {{There is an urgent need to develop a novel sensor that can quickly and
   accurately detect biological warfare agents (BWAs). A novel
   electrochemical sensor was specially designed and developed for
   Staphylococcus aureus as a potential BWAs without using any enzyme,
   antibody, or genetic material. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear
   resistance polarization (LRP), chronoamperometry, impedance
   spectroscopy, and Differential Pulse Volta nnnnetry (DPV) techniques
   were used for fast and accurate detection of BWAs. Co-precipitation
   technique was used for the synthesis of CuO nanoparticles (NPs) for
   their use in the electrochemical sensor.The effect of temperature,
   stirring and addition of CuO NPs was thoroughly investigated. The
   storage, stability, and performance of electrochemical sensor was tested
   for 45 days. The current response of the electrochemical sensor was
   found linear with the correlation coefficient, R-2 = 0.991. The major
   advantage of this novel electrochemical sensor is that immobilization of
   enzyme, antibody, or DNA is not required in sensing technology as the
   immobilization process makes biosensors a highly specific. The novel
   electrochemical sensor was very quick, accurate, non-specific, and
   provide reliable results in the qualitative and quantitative estimation
   of pathogenic bacteria as a potential BWAs.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose This study aims to assess the long-term renal effects of
   bariatric surgery (BS) in severely obese patients over a follow-up
   period of up to 11 years. Materials and Methods In a retrospective
   cohort study including 102 patients, patients were stratified by eGFR at
   baseline and divided into three groups: (1) reduced, (2) normal, and (3)
   increased filtration rate. Adjustments for age- and sex-related decline
   in eGFR were performed. We used uni- and multivariate regression
   analysis to identify variables that were thought to determine change in
   eGFR. Results Over a median follow-up of 8.5 years (interquartile range
   2.7), eGFR declined from 96.1 +/- 20.7 to 84.9 +/- 21.0 ml/min (p <
   0.001). Among patients with (1), eGFR remained stable (69.1 +/- 19.3
   ml/min). Among patients with (2), eGFR declined from 99.7 +/- 13.3
   ml/min to 88.7 +/- 19.4 ml/min (p < 0.001). Among patients with (3),
   eGFR decreased to normal levels (94.2 +/- 17.7 ml/min, p < 0.001). Age-
   and sex-adjusted eGFR increased (6.4 +/- 14.4 ml/min; p < 0.05) among
   patients with reduced filtration rate. Among patients with normal
   filtration rate, adjusted eGFR remained stable during follow-up (-1.3
   +/- 15.2 ml/min; n.s.). Among patients with increased filtration rate,
   adjusted eGFR decreased and remained within the normal range (-13.2 +/-
   12.2 ml/min; p < 0.001). Change in eGFR showed a negative correlation
   with eGFR at baseline (B = -0.31; p < 0.001), change in LDL-cholesterol
   (B = -0.09; p < 0.05), and a negative correlation with treatment
   requiring hypertension (B = -9.36; p = 0.001). Conclusion BS is
   protective against renal function decline in severely obese patients in
   the long term.}},

Abstract = {{Intraosseous transcutaneous implants transferring mechanical stress
   directly from the skeleton to a prosthesis are an area of biological
   mechanics. However, bacterial invasion and weak biosealing with skin
   tissue usually induce implant failure. In this paper, composite coatings
   consisting of beta-FeOOH as an outer layer and Fe-TiO2 as an inner layer
   were prepared on Ti via micro-arc oxidation and hydrothermal treatment
   (HT). The surface microstructures and optical absorption properties of
   the coatings were observed, the production of reactive oxygen species
   (ROS) was measured, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and fibroblast
   behaviors were studied in vitro, and bacteria inactivation and skin
   tissue responses on different surfaces were evaluated in vivo. The
   results show that Fe3+ was doped into TiO2 and beta-FeOOH nanoparticles
   were gradually deposited on TiO2 during HT treatment, forming
   beta-FeOOH/Fe-TiO2 heterojunctions. The light absorption of the
   composite coatings shifted to the longer wavelength region because of a
   narrowed TiO2 bandgap and the formation of heterojunctions. Under light
   irradiation, photoinduced electrons and holes on the heterojunctions
   were separated efficiently. Via optimizing the amount of Fe3+ in TiO2,
   ROS that formed at the heterojunctions after light irradiation for 10
   min could kill 80\% of S. aureus compared with pure Ti in vitro, but
   they did not affect fibroblast behavior, including proliferation and
   phenotyping. In vivo, the optimized beta-FeOOH/Fe-TiO2 heterojunctions,
   upon light irradiation, could inhibit bacterial infection, suppress an
   inflammatory response, and promote integration with skin tissue. Such
   results provide a new perspective suggesting the potential application
   of beta-FeOOH/Fe-TiO2 heterojunctions in percutaneous Ti implants,
   especially in infected cases.}},

Abstract = {{By analyzing the gene expression of endometrial carcinoma (EC) patients,
   the key factors in PI3K signaling pathway and its related genes
   mediating EC were explored. The EC samples and normal endometrial
   samples were downloaded from TCGA database and GTEx database. The R
   language ``limma{''} package was used for differential analysis, and the
   expression level of genes in each tissue was analyzed by
   ``gganatogram{''} package. Functional enrichment analysis of
   differential genes was carried out by KOBAS, an online bioinformatics
   website. The correlation between key genes and differential genes was
   evaluated using TCGA data and GTEx combined gene expression data. The
   corresponding clinical data were downloaded from TCGA database and GTEx
   database, and the R language ``survival{''} package was used to assess
   the potential of candidate differential genes as a key factor of EC.
   Based on the combined differential analysis of TCGA and GTEx databases,
   299 genes with significant differential in expression were finally got.
   Functional enrichment analysis revealed that genes were predominantly
   enriched in the entry of ``Pathways in cancer{''}, including RAC2 and
   PIK3R3 genes which were related with the abnormal PI3K pathway in
   cancer. PIK3R3, a key gene in the PI3K signaling pathway, was
   highly-expressed in EC. SPDEF, GCNT2, KIAA1324, C9orf152, MARVELD3, and
   APEX2 genes were found to be positively correlated with PIK3R3 in EC,
   all of which were highly expressed in EC. KM survival analysis showed
   that SPDEF, GCNT2, KIAA1324 and C9orf152 were significantly correlated
   with patients' survival. ROC analysis showed that SPDEF, GCNT2, KIAA1324
   and C9orf152 gene could be used as potential markers for prognosis and
   survival of EC patients. It was found that PIK3R3, a key gene in the
   PI3K signaling pathway, was highly expressed in EC. The SPDEF, GCNT2,
   KIAA1324 and C9orf152 genes were also highly expressed in EC, and were
   positively correlated with PIK3R3 in EC. Moreover, they are
   significantly correlated with the patients' survival, suggesting that
   they may be potential markers for the prognosis of patients with EC.}},

Title = {{Myeloperoxidase and CYBA genetic variants in polycystic ovary syndrome}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background Oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of
   polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Genetic variations in myeloperoxidase
   (MPO; G-463A) and NADPH oxidase p22phox subunit (CYBA; C242T) cause
   inter-individual variability in enzyme activities. Here, we investigated
   the associations between MPO activity and the MPO G-463A and CYBA C242T
   polymorphisms in Chinese women with PCOS.
   Methods This case-control study included 1003 patients with PCOS and 810
   controls. The G-463A and C242T polymorphisms were detected by polymerase
   chain reaction and restriction analysis, and clinical, hormonal,
   metabolic and oxidative stress parameters and MPO activity were
   analysed.
   Results The frequencies of the GA + AA genotype and A allele frequency
   of the MPO G-463A polymorphism were significantly higher in the PCOS
   group than in the control group. Logistic regression analysis showed
   that the MPO-463A allele is a risk factor for PCOS (OR = 1.261, 95\% CI:
   1.042-1.526, P = .017). Patients with the AA genotype tended to have
   higher plasma MPO activity than those with the GG genotype. No
   statistical significance was found in the genotype and allele
   frequencies of the CYBA C242T polymorphism between the PCOS and control
   groups. However, we demonstrated that the coexistence of the MPO A
   allele (GA + AA genotypes) and the CYBA CC genotype was associated with
   an increased risk of PCOS when compared with the wild-type GG/CC
   genotypes (OR = 1.302, 95\% CI: 1.030-1.646, P = .027).
   Conclusion The MPO G-463A variant, but not CYBA C242T variant, is
   associated with a risk of PCOS in Chinese women.}},

Abstract = {{Fathers of children on the autism spectrum are often in need of support
   due to high levels of parenting stress and the complexity associated
   with raising these children. While the importance of the fathering role
   as both parent and partner is well recognized, the recruitment of
   fathers into support programs is often resource intensive and generally
   fails to achieve desired levels of enrollment and retention. Text2dads
   explored paternal engagement with a program providing text-based
   information and support to smartphones of Australian fathers (N = 184)
   raising children on the autism spectrum. The evaluation is scaffolded by
   Piotrowska et al.'s CAPE model of engagement-Connection, Attendance,
   Participation and Enactment. Analysis demonstrated high rates of
   connection and participation when compared to other father-focused
   interventions. Evidence from response rates, comments and surveys
   demonstrate that fathers actively participated in the project while also
   reporting that they applied information gained from Text2dads in their
   parenting behavior. Advances in mobile communication have created
   opportunities to engage with fathers using alternative modes of
   intervention. The present study demonstrates support for the
   acceptability of this cost effective and highly scalable program.}},

Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{The normal boiling point (NBP) is a fundamental property of liquids and
   marks the intersection of the Gibbs energies of the liquid and the
   gas-phase at ambient pressure. This work provides the first
   comprehensive demonstration of the calculation of boiling points of
   atomic liquids through first-principles molecular-dynamics simulations.
   To this end, thermodynamic integration (TDI) and perturbation theory
   (TPT) are combined with a density-functional theory (DFT) Hamiltonian,
   which provides absolute Gibbs energies, internal energies, and entropies
   of atomic liquids with an accuracy of a few meV/atom. Linear
   extrapolation to the intersection with the Gibbs energy of a
   non-interacting gas-phase eventually pins-down the NBPs. While these
   direct results can already be quite accurate, they are susceptible to a
   systematic over or underbinding of the employed density functional. It
   is shown how this dependency can be strongly reduced and the robustness
   of the method increased through a simple linear correction termed
   lambda-scaling. Eventually, by carefully tuning of the technical
   parameters of the approach, the walltime per element is reduced from
   weeks to about a day (10-20k core-hours), enabling extensive testing for
   B, Al, Na, K, Ca, Sr, Ba, Mn, Cu, Xe, and Hg. This comprehensive
   benchmark demonstrates the excellent performance and robustness of the
   approach with a mean absolute deviation (MAD) of less than 2\% from
   experimental NBPs and very similar accuracy for liquid entropies (MAD
   2.3 J (mol K)(-1), 2\% relative). In some cases, the uncertainties in
   the predictions are several times smaller than the variation between
   literature values, allowing us to clear out long-standing ambiguities in
   the NBPs of B and Ba.}},

Abstract = {{Treatment utilization following child sexual abuse (CSA) is essential in
   combatting the various negative consequences of CSA. Youth may present
   to treatment for CSA with symptoms that cut across multiple diagnostic
   presentations that impact their ability to successfully engage in
   treatment. In particular, children who have difficulties with attention
   may have unique treatment needs following CSA. The purpose of this study
   was to examine how attention problems interplay with comorbid symptoms
   and how these clinical presentations impact treatment outcomes for youth
   who have been sexually abused. Participants included 323 families
   presenting to treatment for CSA. Youth were 7 to 19 years old, 78.5\%
   female, and 76.6\% identified as Caucasian/White. Results indicated that
   22.9\% of the youth presented with clinically elevated attention
   problems as collected through parent-report of the Child Behavior
   Checklist (CBCL). Results demonstrated that child survivors of CSA who
   presented with attention problems self-reported more psychological
   concerns (e.g., symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic
   stress). At post-treatment, attention problems, interpersonal problems,
   and thought problems were significantly reduced for youth initially
   presenting with attention problems. Further implications for treatment
   following CSA and unique needs for youth with attention problems are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing demand for herbicides in agricultural fields affected
   aquatic environments as they entered into water bodies by agricultural
   runoff. Glyphosate (GLY), an organophosphate herbicide, is widely used
   in India for weed control. This study aimed to evaluate the toxic
   effects of GLY on climbing perch Anabas testudineus by studying its
   effects on the gonadosomatic index (GSI), hepatosomatic index (HSI),
   gonad and liver histology, spawning performance, and haematological
   parameters (RBC, WBC, haemoglobin). In this study, Anabas testudineus
   were exposed to three sub-lethal concentrations of GLY such as T1: 2.6
   ppm (1/30th of 48h LC50), T2: 3.9 ppm (1/20th of 48h LC50) and T3: 7.8
   ppm (1/10th of 48 hr LC50) for 45 days with 12 fish in each tank.
   Results indicated a significant decrease in GSI, HSI, structural
   alterations in testis, and ovary on 30th and 45th days of exposure.
   Vacuolation in tissue, dilution of sinusoid, altered tissue architecture
   in the liver, reduction in spawning performances (fertilization and
   hatching rate), increase in WBC count, decrease in RBC number and
   haemoglobin content were observed in all treatment groups on the 45th
   day exposure. Thus, the outcome of the present study revealed that the
   herbicide could deleteriously impair reproductive fitness, alter the
   liver structure, and haematological parameter of A. testudineus with a
   possible reduction in growth and population size.}},

Title = {{Impact of Language on Behavior Assessment Outcomes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL EDUCATION}},
Abstract = {{Conducting a functional analysis is the ``gold standard{''} of behavior
   assessment with best practices recommending identification of
   idiosyncratic variables as essential to valid results. One potential
   variable that might impact assessment results is language of assessment.
   For individuals who operate in environments with multiple languages
   (e.g., English and Spanish), the language of assessment might
   differentially impact assessment results. Therefore, there is a need to
   evaluate if language of assessment affects identified function. The
   current study presents the results of 10 cases in which the
   experimenters conducted assessments (i.e., functional analysis) in both
   the Spanish and English language. Participants were nine children with
   autism who engaged in problem behavior and whose parents reported
   Spanish as the primary home language. Result indicates correspondence of
   function for eight of the ten cases. Discussion of results and
   recommendations for practice and future research are presented.}},

   English Grammar in Gambian Senior Secondary Schools}},
Journal = {{EDUCATION RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{Studies have shown that several factors predict students' achievement in
   any second language classroom. These factors include learner, school,
   text, and teacher-related variables. The teacher is indispensable in the
   instructional procedure; therefore, the quality of a teacher in terms of
   teaching experience, subject mastery, and questioning behaviour can
   determine ESL students' learning outcomes to a large extent. This study
   examined the relationship between teachers' subject mastery and
   questioning behaviour and students' achievement in English grammar in
   the Gambia. The research design is a descriptive survey that comprised
   300 students and 10 English language teachers from four senior secondary
   schools in Kanifing Municipal Council. Two research instruments were
   used and the data were analysed using PPMC and MRA. The result showed
   that independent variables predicted students' achievement in English
   grammar. Teachers' subject mastery (beta = 0.476; t = 12.132; p<0.05)
   and questioning behaviour (beta = 0.204; t = 5.195; p<0.05) contributed
   significantly to students' achievement in English grammar relatively and
   jointly. Recommendations were made to stakeholders to ensure regular
   training of in-service and preservice language teachers on the teacher
   and teaching-related variables in ESL classrooms.}},

Abstract = {{The recent development of compounds for recognizing ions highlights the
   applicability of this area. In this work, the simultaneous recognition
   of cations (Li+, Na+ and K+) and anions (F-, Cl- and I-) using a
   macrocycle comprising a simple crown ether and an iodine-triazole unit
   is investigated. The roles of the (i) cation radius, (ii) anion radius,
   and (iii) electron withdrawing (-CN) and donor (-OH) groups of the
   receptor in ionic recognition were evaluated. Energy decomposition
   analysis (EDA) shows that the ion-receptor interactions are attractive
   and predominantly electrostatic. Molecular electrostatic potential plots
   and EDA analysis reveal that a decreasing cation radius favors
   interactions with the oxygen atoms present in the crown ether. A
   decreasing anion radius increases the sigma-hole interactions with the
   iodine atoms present in the receptors. In compounds containing -CN and
   -OH groups, the oxygen atoms in the crown ether show lower ability to
   interact with the Na+ cation. Nevertheless, in the receptor-OH
   structure, the Na+MIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSISOH interactions
   counterbalance the lower ability of the crown ether oxygens to interact
   with the Na+ cation. I- recognition is enhanced by the presence of -OH
   and, more strongly, -CN groups, occurring due to the increased
   sigma-hole area in the receptor-CN structure, as supported by a
   C-HMIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSISI- interaction in the receptor-OH
   compound. The reported results are useful for the design of compounds
   with improved capabilities for both cation and anion recognition prior
   to engaging in exploratory synthesis efforts.}},

Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY}},

Abstract = {{Imidazole (Im) and imidazolium (ImH(+)) cations play a vital role in the
   stability of biomolecules in an aqueous environment. The importance of
   water molecules in the interaction between ImH(+) and aromatic amino
   acids (AAs) is unprecedented. Thus, we have used both quantum mechanical
   (QM) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation approaches to understand the
   nature of interactions between AAs and ImH(+) with water molecules. The
   microscopic studies of AA models and ImH(+)-water (ImH(+)W(n), where n =
   0-4) clusters were calculated using the M05-2X/6-31+G{*}{*} method. From
   DFT calculations, it is observed that the absence of water molecules in
   ImH(+) favors the N-HMIDLINE HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS pi interactions (i.e.,
   T-shape) with AAs, whereas the microhydrated clusters of ImH(+) prefer
   to stabilize the stacking conformation. The presence of water-mediated
   hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) interactions is highly favorable for the
   stacked confirmation of AAs-ImH(+) complexes. This also directly
   influences the energetics of the cluster. The magnitude of the
   interaction strength between ImH(+)W(n) and the selected AAs is in the
   order of Phe < Tyr similar to Trp. The water-mediated H-bonding
   interactions act as the main driving force for the stability of
   pi-stacking complexes. Both DFT and MD studies reveal that the ImH(+)
   cation and water molecules play a vital role in the protein stability
   and also this can intuitively initiate the denaturation process.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{David Armstrong (1983) argues that necessitation relations among
   universals are the best explanation of some of our observations. If we
   consequently accept them into our ontologies, then we can justify
   induction, because these necessitation relations also have implications
   for the unobserved. By embracing Armstrongian universals, we can
   vindicate some of our strongest epistemological intuitions and answer
   the Problem of Induction. However, Armstrong's reasoning has recently
   been challenged on a variety of grounds. Critics argue against both
   Armstrong's usage of inference to the best explanation and even whether,
   by Armstrong's own standards, necessitation relations offer a potential
   explanation of this explanandum, let alone the best explanation. I
   defend Armstrong against these particular criticisms. Firstly, even
   though there are reasons to think that Armstrong's justification fails
   as a self-contained defence of induction, it can usefully complement
   several other answers to Hume. Secondly, I argue that Armstrong's
   reasoning is consistent with his own standards for explanation.}},

   tundra delays seedling development}},
Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{Altered species composition caused by environmental and climatic change
   can affect the transfer of plant residues among communities. Whereas
   transferred residues are typically considered a resource in recipient
   systems, residues of allelopathic species may instead cause
   interference.
   Evergreen dwarf shrubs, specifically the allelopathic species Empetrum
   nigrum are increasing in abundance in response to a warming climate.
   Empetrum has small, evergreen leaves that can be transferred to other
   communities when withered and lost from the plant.
   We hypothesize that Empetrum can have allelopathic effects in the
   recipient communities of the withered leaves. We call this allochthonous
   allelopathy as opposed to autochthonous allelopathy, which is well
   documented in communities where the plant grows.
   We measured influx of allochthonous Empetrum leaves onto snow-covered
   snowbeds, where they are easily identified within the debris. Next, we
   compared the bioactivity of allochthonous withered leaves with that of
   green Empetrum leaves. Finally, we conducted an experiment testing the
   germination and seedling growth of 10 tundra species in snowbed soil
   supplemented with no (control) and three densities of allochthonous
   Empetrum leaves.
   We found Empetrum leaves to be common on the snow cover of snowbeds. We
   found Empetrum leaves collected on snowbeds to be as bioactive as green
   leaves. Finally, we found forb species to have reduced germination and
   all 10 species to have delayed seedling development when growing in
   snowbed soil supplemented with withered Empetrum leaves. Seedlings under
   the control treatment were 2.3 times longer and had 3.2 times more
   leaves in comparison to seedlings grown under the strongest
   allochthonous leaf treatment.
   Results from our study imply that Empetrum is allelopathic in recipient
   systems of its allochthonous leaves. The abundant nature of Empetrum in
   the tundra suggests that allochthonous allelopathy is a common
   phenomenon, causing biotic stress in snowbeds and potentially other
   parts of the tundra. Exemplifying the ability of a plant to interfere in
   neighbouring communities, our study demonstrates a plant trait that may
   provide insight to other study systems.

Abstract = {{Background The number of reports on sarcoidosis complicated by
   hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is limited, and most describe cases
   complicated by chronic bird-related HP. Here, we present for the first
   time a case with Propionibacterium acnes-associated sarcoidosis
   complicated by acute bird-related HP. Case presentation A 62-year-old
   man with a past medical history of sarcoidosis was admitted to our
   department, and chest computed tomography showed diffuse ground-glass
   opacities, which appeared as he rapidly increased the number of pigeons
   he kept for a competition. Random transbronchial lung biopsy revealed
   well-formed non-caseating epithelioid granulomas, which contained
   positively stained substances on immunohistochemistry using the PAB
   antibody, a specific monoclonal antibody against P. acnes lipoteichoic
   acid. Poorly formed non-caseating granulomas without positively stained
   substances were also detected. Conclusion We describe the successful
   identification of this exceptionally rare case of sarcoidosis
   complicated by acute bird-related HP in which two morphologically and
   immunohistologically different types of granulomas were present in the
   same lung.}},

Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Following the damage to infrastructure systems in the 2011 Tohoku
   earthquake, a new seismic design concept named the anti-catastrophe
   concept in seismic design framework was proposed for the resilience of
   infrastructure. It states that seismic damage to infrastructure could
   shift discontinuously from a normal to a severe level, which we refer to
   as the `phase transition' of infrastructure damage. In this article,
   damage to a peripheral lifeline system involving buried pipes for water
   distribution and sewerage, and power distribution equipment was analysed
   surveying statistical damage data in the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. It was
   observed that the damage to the peripheral lifeline systems went beyond
   the assumption made under the previous damage measures using a
   relatively lower and moderate seismic intensity at which the degree of
   the damage became rapidly serious, thereby representing the threshold to
   the phase transition of infrastructure performance. Further, preferable
   seismic disaster response with the reduction of the `large uncertainty
   of the impact' of the phase transition of infrastructure damage was
   discussed. Based on the discussion, implications for the resilience of
   peripheral lifeline systems were derived. The anti-catastrophe concept
   for the seismic design was introduced and conditions for the
   implementation of such design concept were summarised.}},

   to help educators address multiple critical issues in the field of
   education, specifically: (a) educator needs at the individual-level,
   such as educator burnout, engagement, and performance; (b)
   implementation fidelity of system-wide initiatives and evidence-based
   interventions; and (c) educator needs at the leadership-level,
   particularly the training of educational leaders. Recommendations for
   how OBM researchers and practitioners can expand engagement with
   educational settings are explored. Given the impact of organizational
   leadership, we emphasize the future collaboration between OBM and

Journal = {{GEOFLUIDS}},

Abstract = {{Fluid flow in rocks has a key role in many geological processes, such as
   in geothermal reservoirs and crustal deformation. Permeability is known
   to be dependent on porosity and flow path aperture, but direct
   quantification of pore structures is more difficult than direct
   estimation of permeability. The gas breakthrough method can be used to
   determine the radius of transport pores by using the gas pressure at
   which gas breaks through a water-saturated sample (Delta Pbreak). In
   this study, we applied the gas breakthrough method under confining
   pressure to damaged granite, in order to evaluate the relationship
   between permeability and pore characteristics (i.e., porosity and
   transport flow path aperture) at pressures up to 30 MPa. The transport
   flow path aperture, permeability, and porosity of thermally cracked
   granite decrease with increasing confining pressure. We quantified the
   relationship between permeability and pore characteristics, which
   provides a better estimation of permeability by taking into account the
   fraction of hydraulically connected cracks.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive computational studies of structure, stability and related

   and metastable relative to the conformers with the components simply
   attached. Two possible ways of producing such systems are indicated.
   Analysis of contributing interactions and dipoles, and their respective
   additivities is performed. Properties of the ion-molecule sub-complexes
   are addressed. The IR intensity spectra are simulated and exhibit a
   peculiar evolution upon formation of the insertion complex, facilitating
   its experimental detection and differentiation from other conformers. An
   insight into the influence of the electric field of the counter-ions on

Abstract = {{Various studies have found that reading books about positive
   interactions between ingroup and outgroup characters, known as media
   vicarious contact, can reduce prejudice. Focusing on the fantasy saga of
   The Hunger Games, we examined the effects of negative vicarious contact
   on collective action across two studies. Specifically, we tested whether
   reading about fantasy characters living in a postapocalyptic conflictual
   society with large social disparities between advantaged and
   disadvantaged groups leads advantaged group members to display greater
   willingness to engage in collective action on behalf of the
   disadvantaged group. Results from Study 1 (correlational survey in the
   United Kingdom and United States) and Study 2 (experimental intervention
   in Italy) revealed that reading The Hunger Games is indirectly
   associated with greater collective action intentions via increased anger
   toward injustice. In both studies social dominance orientation (SDO)
   acted as a moderator, but in opposite directions: mediation was
   significant for low-SDOs in Study 1, and for high-SDOs in Study 2.
   Results are discussed in relation to the importance of media vicarious
   contact via book reading for social change, and to the need to identify
   the contextual conditions allowing to anticipate the specific moderation
   pattern that is more likely to emerge.}},

Title = {{Efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of a plant-derived, quadrivalent,

Abstract = {{Background Seasonal influenza remains a substantial public health threat
   despite the availability of egg-derived and other vaccines. Plant-based
   manufacturing might address some of the limitations of current vaccines.
   We describe two phase 3 efficacy studies of a recombinant quadrivalent
   virus-like particle (QVLP) influenza vaccine manufactured in plants, one
   in adults aged 18-64 years (the 18-64 study) and one in older people
   aged 65 years and older (the 65-plus study).
   Methods We did two randomised, observer-blind, multinational studies in
   the northern hemisphere in the 2017-18 (the 18-64 study) and 2018-19
   (the 65-plus study) influenza seasons. The 18-64 study was done at 73
   sites and the 65-plus study was done at 104 sites, both across Asia,
   Europe, and North America. In the 18-64 study, inclusion criteria were
   body-mass index less than 40 kg/m(2); age 18-64 years at screening
   visit; and good health. In the 65-plus study, inclusion criteria were
   body-mass index of maximum 35 kg/m(2); aged 65 years or older at
   screening visit; not living in a rehabilitation centre or care home; and
   no acute or evolving medical problems. Participants in the 18-64 study
   were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either QVLP vaccine (30 mu g
   haemagglutinin per strain) or placebo. Participants in the 65-plus study
   were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive QVLP vaccine (30 mu g
   haemagglutinin per strain) or quadrivalent inactivated vaccine (QIV; 15
   mu g haemagglutinin per strain). The primary outcome in the 18-64 study
   was absolute vaccine efficacy to prevent laboratory-confirmed,
   respiratory illness caused by antigenically matched influenza strains.
   The primary outcome in the 65-plus study was relative vaccine efficacy
   to prevent laboratory-confirmed influenza-like illness caused by any
   influenza strain. The primary analyses were done in the per-protocol
   population and safety was assessed in all participants who received the
   assigned treatment. These studies are registered with ClinicalTrials.
   gov (18-64 study NCT03301051; 65-plus study NCT03739112).
   Findings In the 18-64 study, between Aug 30, 2017, and Jan 15, 2018, 10
   160 participants were randomly assigned to receive either QVLP vaccine
   (5077 participants) or placebo (5083 participants). The per-protocol
   population consisted of 4814 participants in the QVLP group and 4812 in
   the placebo group. The study did not meet its primary endpoint of 70\%
   absolute vaccine efficacy for the QVLP vaccine (35.1\% {[}95\% CI 17.9
   to 48.7]) against respiratory illness caused by matched strains. 55
   (1.1\%) of 5064 participants in the QVLP group versus 51 (1.0\%) of 5072
   in the placebo group had a serious adverse event. Four (0.1\%) and six
   {[}0.1\%] participants had severe treatment-related treatment-emergent
   adverse events. In the 65-plus study, between Sept 18, 2018, and Feb 22,
   2019, 12 794 participants were randomly assigned to receive either QVLP
   vaccine (6396 participants) or QIV (6398 participants). The per-protocol
   population consisted of 5996 participants in the QVLP group and 6026 in
   the QIV group. The study met its primary non-inferiority endpoint with a
   relative vaccine efficacy of the QVLP vaccine for the prevention of
   influenza-like illness caused by any strain of 8.8\% (-16.7 to 28.7).
   263 (4. 1\%) of 6352 participants in the QVLP group versus 266 (4.2\%)
   of 6366 in the QIV group had serious adverse events (one {[}<0.1\%] vs
   two {[}<0.1\%] were considered treatment-related); one (<0.1\%) versus
   three (<0.1\%) participants had severe treatment-related
   treatment-emergent adverse events.
   Interpretation These efficacy studies are the first large-scale studies
   of any plant-derived human vaccine. Together, they show that the
   plant-derived QVLP vaccine can provide substantial protection against
   respiratory illness and influenza-like illness caused by influenza
   viruses in adults. QVLP vaccine was well tolerated and no major safety
   signal arose in participants who received QVLP vaccine across the two
   studies. Copyright (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Three tourmaline reference materials sourced from the Harvard
   Mineralogical and Geological Museum (schorl 112566, dravite 108796 and
   elbaite 98144), which are already widely used for the calibration of in
   situ boron isotope measurements, are characterised here for their oxygen
   and lithium isotope compositions. Homogeneity tests by secondary ion
   mass spectrometry (SIMS) showed that at sub-nanogram test portion
   masses, their O-18/O-16 and Li-7/Li-6 isotope ratios are constant within
   +/- 0.27 parts per thousand and +/- 2.2 parts per thousand (1s),
   respectively. The lithium mass fractions of the three materials vary
   over three orders of magnitude. SIMS homogeneity tests showed variations
   in Li-7/Si-28 between 8\% and 14\% (1s), which provides a measure of the
   heterogeneity of the Li contents in these three materials. Here, we
   provide recommended values for delta O-18, Delta'O-17 and delta Li-7 for
   the three Harvard tourmaline reference materials based on results from
   bulk mineral analyses from multiple, independent laboratories using
   laser- and stepwise fluorination gas mass spectrometry (for O), and
   solution multi-collector inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy
   (for Li). These bulk data also allow us to assess the degree of
   inter-laboratory bias that might be present in such data sets. This work
   also re-evaluates the major element chemical composition of the
   materials by electron probe microanalysis and investigates these
   presence of a chemical matrix effect on SIMS instrumental mass
   fractionation with regard to delta O-18 determinations, which was found
   to be < 1.6 parts per thousand between these three materials. The final
   table presented here provides a summary of the isotope ratio values that
   we have determined for these three materials. Depending on their
   starting mass, either 128 or 512 splits have been produced of each
   material, assuring their availability for many years into the future.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we present a general algorithm for processing
   microcalorimeter data with special applicability to data with high
   photon count rates. Conventional optimal filtering, which has become
   ubiquitous in microcalorimeter data processing, suffers from its
   inability to recover overlapped pulses without sacrificing spectral
   resolution. The technique presented here was developed to address this
   particular shortcoming and does so without imposing any assumptions
   beyond those made by the conventional technique. We demonstrate the
   performance of the algorithm with a dataset that approximately satisfies
   these assumptions and which is representative of a wide range of
   microcalorimeter applications. We also apply the technique to a highly
   non-linear dataset, examining the impact on performance in the limit
   that these assumptions break down.}},

   arthroscopic iliopsoas tenotomy for anterior impingement following THA.
   She ultimately required revision of the acetabular
   cup.ConclusionsArthroscopic tenotomy for refractory iliopsoas
   tendinopathy may be appealing because of its less invasive nature.
   However, caution should be exercised in the setting of significant cup

Abstract = {{Interleukin (IL)-33 is associated with vascular restenosis after carotid
   artery balloon injury. This work aims to investigate the involvement of
   IL-33 in carotid artery balloon injury. We first constructed carotid
   artery balloon injury model in male Wistar rats. Then, we found that
   IL-33 was highly expressed in the rats with carotid artery balloon
   injury 3, 14 and 21 days after surgery. Furthermore, IL-33 treatment
   promoted inflammatory response and carotid artery intimal hyperplasia in
   the rats with carotid artery balloon injury, which was effectively
   improved by anti-IL-33 treatment. In addition, IL-33 treatment enhanced
   proliferation, migration, inflammatory response and tube formation of
   human umbilical vein endothelial cells in a concentration-dependent way.
   In summary, our study demonstrates that IL-33 treatment promotes the
   progression of vascular restenosis after carotid artery balloon injury
   by enhancing carotid artery intimal hyperplasia and inflammatory
   response. Thus, our findings suggest that IL-33 maybe a valuable target
   for carotid artery balloon injury therapies.}},

Title = {{Low expression of hsa\_circ\_0001811 in gastric cancer and its role in
   clinical diagnosis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLINICAL LABORATORY ANALYSIS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{Background As far as gastric cancer is concerned, there is a lack of
   specific early diagnostic biomarkers in clinical diagnosis. Circular
   RNAs (circRNAs) have been found to be stable in gastric cancer tissues
   and plasma, so they have the potential to become new type of diagnostic
   biomarkers for gastric cancer.
   Materials and Methods The hsa\_circ\_0001811 expressions in gastric
   cancer tissues and paired non-cancer tissues, preoperative and
   postoperative plasma of patients with gastric cancer, and plasma of
   healthy volunteers were detected using quantitative reverse
   transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The receiver operating
   characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn; and the combined ROC curves were
   used to analyze their diagnostic values. The correlation between the
   plasma or tissue hsa\_circ\_0001811 levels and the clinicopathological
   factors of gastric cancer was further analyzed.
   Results Hsa\_circ\_0001811 was found to be lowly expressed in gastric
   cancer tissues and plasma from patients with gastric cancer. The area
   under the ROC curve (AUC) in the gastric cancer tissues and the plasma
   of patients with gastric cancer was 0.658 and 0.747, respectively. The
   AUC increased to 0.824 after combination of both. The expression level
   of hsa\_circ\_0001811 in gastric cancer tissue correlated with
   carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (P = .0347), tissue differentiation (P =
   .0138), and lymph node metastasis (P = .0234), while plasma
   hsa\_circ\_0001811 level was related to carbohydrate antigen (CA19-9) (P
   = .0278), lymph node metastasis (P = .0469), distant metastasis (P =
   .0384), and age (P = .0085).
   Conclusions The above results indicate that hsa\_circ\_0001811 may
   become a new biomarker for clinical diagnosis of gastric cancer.}},

Title = {{Controllable Assembly of Upconversion Nanoparticles Enhanced Tumor Cell
   Penetration and Killing Efficiency}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The use of upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) for treating deep-seated
   cancers and large tumors has recently been gaining momentum.
   Conventional approaches for loading photosensitizers (PS) to UCNPs using
   noncovalent physical adsorption and covalent conjugation had been
   previously described. However, these methods are time-consuming and
   require extra modification steps. Incorporating PS loading during the
   controlled UCNPs assembly process is seldom reported. In this study, an
   amphiphilic copolymer, poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride), is used to
   instruct UCNPs assembly formations into well-controlled UCNPs clusters
   of various sizes, and the gap zones formed between individual UCNPs can
   be used to encapsulate PS. This nanostructure production process results
   in a considerably simpler and reliable method to load PS and other
   compounds. Also, after considering factors such as PS loading quantity,
   penetration in 3D bladder tumor organoids, and singlet oxygen
   production, the small UCNPs clusters displayed superior cell killing
   efficacy compared to single and big sized clusters. Therefore, these
   UCNPs clusters with different sizes could facilitate a clear and deep
   understanding of nanoparticle-based delivery platform systems for cell
   killing and may pave a new way for other fields of UCNPs based
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose To assess changes in health insurance coverage for young cancer
   patients pre- and post- the Affordable Care Act-Dependent Care Expansion
   (ACA-DCE) implementation in California. Further, we examined differences
   in insurance coverage by socioeconomic and race/ethnicity. Methods Data
   were obtained from the California Cancer Registry and Medicaid
   enrollment files, from 2005 to 2014. We conducted
   difference-in-difference analyses among 7042 cancer patients aged 22-25
   years ({''}intervention group{''}) and 25,269 aged 26-34 years
   ({''}control group{''}). We also examined the independent and combined
   effects of race/ethnicity and neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES)
   on insurance coverage. Results After the ACA-DCE implementation, we
   observed a 52.7\% reduction in the proportion of uninsured and a 35.7\%
   increase in the proportion of privately insured patients. There was also
   a 17.3\% reduction in Medicaid at cancer diagnosis and a 27.5\%
   reduction in discontinuous Medicaid enrollment. However, these benefits
   were limited to patients of non-Hispanic White, Hispanic and
   Asian/Pacific Islander race/ethnicity living in higher nSES, with no
   differences in insurance enrollment among young adults who lived in low
   nSES or those of Black race/ethnicity. Conclusion The ACA-DCE broadened
   insurance coverage for young adults with cancer in California. Yet, only
   certain subgroups of patients have benefited from this policy.}},

Title = {{A deep learning system for health care IoT and smartphone malware
   detection}},
Journal = {{NEURAL COMPUTING \& APPLICATIONS}},
Abstract = {{The use of smart and connected devices, such as Android and Internet of
   Things (IoT) have increased exponentially. In the last 10 years, mobiles
   and IoT devices have surpassed PC's utilization. Android hosts an array
   of connected sensors like IoT. It has transformed a simple gadget into a
   hub of mobile phone with IoT. With a high number of clients and enormous
   assortment of Android applications it has been an appealing target for
   many security threats including malware attacks. To monitor a host of
   the applications that runs on Android and IoT devices, this study
   employs a deep learning based feature detector for malware detection
   which can easily be trained and be used with different classifiers to
   assess an application's behavior. The features learnt by the detector
   can be reused to transfer their learning to any future endeavors toward
   malware detection. To test the accuracy and effectiveness of the feature
   detector we test it in two phases: (i) first the features extracted are
   fed to a fully connected network (FCN) with Softmax activation and in
   (ii) second scheme we use recurrent layers of attentions to classify the
   Applications either as malicious or benign. Our findings reveal that the
   proposed feature detector achieves significant results with an F1-Score

Abstract = {{Background For infants and young children in low-income settings, human
   milk (HM) is the main source of omega-3 (n-3) long-chain polyunsaturated
   fatty acids (LCPs), including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and
   eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). However, the n-3 LCPs concentrations of HM
   show wide variability, largely depending on the maternal intake of
   marine foods. This may put children living far from coastal areas at
   risk of inadequate intake. We evaluated the efficacy of fish-oil (FO)
   supplementation of lactating mothers on HM n-3 LCPs concentrations in a
   rural setting from Ethiopia. Methods Mothers (n = 360) with children
   6-12 months old were randomized to receive either intervention FO
   capsules (215 mg DHA + 285 mg EPA) or control corn-oil capsules (without
   n-3 LCPs). In a random subsample of 154 participants, we analyzed LCPs
   in HM and child capillary blood using gas chromatography. Results
   Compared to the control, FO supplementation increased HM concentrations
   of DHA by 39.0\% (95\% CI: 20.6, 57.5\%; P < 0.001) and EPA by 36.2\%
   (95\% CI: 16.0, 56.4\%; P < 0.001), whereas the arachidonic acid
   (AA)/(DHA + EPA) ratio decreased by 53.5\% (95\% CI: -70.2, -36.7\%; P <
   0.001). We also found statistically significant association between the
   changes in (DHA + EPA)/AA ratio in HM and child capillary blood (P <
   0.001). However, HM DHA concentrations remained lower than international
   norms after FO supplementation. Conclusions FO supplementation improves
   n-3 LCPs content of HM. Future studies should evaluate different doses
   of n-3 LCPs and consider potential effect modifiers such as genetic
   polymorphism and diet. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov
   as NCT01817634.}},

Abstract = {{Although consumer behavior literature has analyzed narcissistic
   consumers in detail, little is known about their post-purchase attitudes
   and behaviors. With the help of the grounded theory approach, this study
   investigates the post-purchase attitudes and behaviors of consumers
   higher in narcissism. Findings suggest that narcissistic consumers do
   not ruminate and thus do not feel regret about their consumption
   preferences. They strive to stay distinct in their product and brand
   preferences and hence readily engage in brand-switching behavior. Also,
   they are not eager to talk about product and brand preferences and react
   adversely to criticism of their choices. Overall the study finds that
   narcissistic attitudes negatively affect brand loyalty and word-of-mouth
   intentions. Findings are discussed alongside other theoretical

Abstract = {{Seed coat impermeability (SCI) in soybean is associated with seed
   viability under storage and quality of processed products. Understanding
   genetics and identification of linked molecular markers would facilitate
   need-based utilization of seed coat impermeability. Two impermeable wild
   type (G. soja Sieb. and Zucc.) accessions viz. PI 424079 and PI 136620
   were crossed with a permeable cultivated (G. max) variety JS335 to
   generate the mapping populations. Genetic analysis of the F-1:2 and
   F-2:3 seeds of the crosses indicated that SCI is controlled by a single
   gene/major QTL, and impermeability is dominant over permeability.
   Presence of seeds with intermediate permeability indicated role of some
   minor genes/QTLs. A set of 204 inter-specific recombinant inbred line
   (RILs) (F-7) was used to map SCI with 207 SSR markers. Phenotyping
   through rapid imbibition approach (seed imbibition for 6 h), seven QTLs
   were mapped on chromosomes (Chrs.) 2, 5, 12, 13 and 16 in the seeds
   stored for 1-3 years, while through slow imbibition method (seed
   imbibition for 7 days), five QTLs were mapped on Chrs. 2, 9, 10 and 20.
   Phenotypic variation explained (PVE) by the QTLs ranged from 5.96 to
   39.67\%. Two major and stable QTLs viz., qScI-h2-1 and qScI-h2-2 that
   mapped in tandem on Chr.2 jointly explained 43.09-62.92\% of the
   variations in impermeability. Seven minor QTLs identified here were
   novel and two (qScI-h5, and qScI-h16) were consistent. It is the first
   report of mapping impermeability using two imbibition approaches
   together in 200 plus inter-specific RILs in soybean. The study will pave
   the way for developing genotypes with restricted permeability, enhanced
   seed viability, and improved seeds quality.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanism for catalytic conversion of ethanol over
   La0.7Sr0.3MnO3-x(100) surface to acetaldehyde and ethene was
   investigated. Pre-exposure temperature-programmed reaction (PE-TPR)
   experiments were performed in which ethanol was introduced to oxidized
   or reduced surfaces followed by heating. In particular, sequential
   PE-TPR experiments were conducted to incrementally and gradually reduce
   the surface. The products and their ratios were investigated as a
   function of surface reduction. The data show that acetaldehyde and
   ethene production is catalyzed with hydrogen abstraction and oxygen
   abstraction reactions occurring by intermediates in vacancies at various
   temperatures >400 K. Adsorption of acetaldehyde followed by a
   temperature-programmed reaction does not produce ethene, indicating that
   acetaldehyde is not an intermediate to ethene and that the hydrogen and
   oxygen abstraction from ethanol to ethene are decoupled steps. Further
   evidence for this mechanistic nuance was obtained using isotopically
   labeled ethanol (CD3CH2OH), which produces CD3CHO and CD2CH2. The ratio
   of aldehyde production to alkene production increases with reduction,
   suggesting that aldehyde is produced from a disproportionation reaction
   between ethoxy species in adjacent O-vacancies, while ethene is produced
   from a dehydrogenation reaction with ethoxy species in vacancies without
   requiring adjacent O-vacancies. Counterintuitively, this finding
   indicates that the more oxygenated product (aldehyde vs ethene) is
   favored with more vacancies and that the net alcohol conversion is
   autocatalytic. Density functional theory calculations were able to find
   the previously unknown disproportionation pathway between ethoxies in
   adjacent O-vacancies, and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations support this
   interpretation by reproducing experimental selectivities. The activation
   energies for these pathways are estimated as 132 +/- 10 kJ/mol for the
   disproportionation reaction (when occurring between ethoxies in adjacent
   vacancies) and as 148 +/- 11 kJ/mol for the direct dehydrogenation
   reaction of an ethoxy in a vacancy. Based on these results, a mechanism
   with operative pathways based on elementary steps in O-vacancies is
   reported.}},

Abstract = {{Emerging evidence suggests that Toll-like receptors (TLRs) ligands
   pretreatment may play a vital role in the progress of myocardial
   ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. As the ligand of TLR3,
   polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), a synthetic double-stranded
   RNA, whether its preconditioning can exhibit a cardioprotective
   phenotype remains unknown. Here, we report the protective effect of
   poly(I:C) pretreatment in acute myocardial I/R injury by activating
   TLR3/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Poly(I:C) pretreatment leads to a
   significant reduction of infarct size, improvement of cardiac function,
   and downregulation of inflammatory cytokines and apoptotic molecules
   compared with controls. Subsequently, our data demonstrate that
   phosphorylation of TLR3 tyrosine residue and its interaction with PI3K
   is enhanced, and protein levels of phospho-PI3K and phospho-Akt are both
   increased after poly(I:C) pretreatment, while knock out of TLR3
   suppresses the cardioprotection of poly(I:C) preconditioning through a
   decreased activation of PI3K/Akt signaling. Moreover, inhibition of p85
   PI3K by the administration of LY294002 in vivo and knockdown of Akt by
   siRNA in vitro significantly abolish poly(I:C) preconditioning-induced
   cardioprotective effect. In conclusion, our results reveal that
   poly(I:C) preconditioning exhibits essential protection in myocardial
   I/R injury via its modulation of TLR3, and the downstream PI3K/Akt
   signaling, which may provide a potential pharmacologic target for
   perioperative cardioprotection.}},

   Virus and Its Association with Disease Severity}},

Abstract = {{Influenza A viruses cause a spectrum of responses, from mild coldlike
   symptoms to severe respiratory illness and death. Intrinsic host
   factors, such as age, can influence disease severity. Glycosylation
   plays a critical role in influenza pathogenesis; however, the molecular
   drivers of influenza outcomes remain unknown. In this work, we
   characterized the host glycomic response Refen rice to the H1N1 2009
   pandemic influenza A virus (H1N1pdm09) as a function of age-dependent
   severity in a ferret model. Using our dual-color lectin microarray
   technology, we examined baseline glycosylation and glycomic response to
   infection in newly weaned and aged animals, models for young children
   and the elderly, respectively. Compared to adult uninfected ferrets, we
   observed higher levels of alpha-2,6-sialosides, the receptor for
   H1N1pdm09, in newly weaned and aged animals. We also observed
   age-dependent loss of O-linked alpha-2,3-sialosides. The loss of these
   highly charged groups may impact viral clearance by mucins, which
   corresponds to the lower clearance rates observed in aged animals. Upon
   infection, we observed dramatic changes in the glycomes of aged animals,
   a population severely impacted by the virus. In contrast, no significant
   alterations were observed in the newly weaned animals, which show mild
   to moderate responses to the H1N1pdm09. High mannose, a glycan recently
   identified as a marker of severity in adult animals, increased with
   severity in the aged population. However, the response was delayed, in
   line with the delayed development of pneumonia observed. Overall, our
   results may help explain the differential susceptibility to influenza A
   infection and severity observed as a function of age.}},

   multiple recruitment strategies including clinic-based recruitment,
   letters to patients identified from electronic databases, the patient
   portal, brochures and posters placed in clinics, presentations to heart
   failure support groups, and online advertising. We screened 10,291
   medical records, enrolled 231 participants, and 195 participants
   completed baseline data collection. We enrolled 92 (23\%) participants
   using clinic-based recruitment, 24 and 29 (6\% and 10\%) using letters

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{This paper contains discussions on the entanglement entropy and mutual
   information of a strongly coupled field theory with a critical point
   which has a holographic dual. We investigate analytically, in the
   specific regimes of parameters, how these nonlocal operators behave near
   the critical point. Interestingly, we observe that although the mutual
   information is constant at the critical point, its slope shows a
   power-law divergence in the vicinity of the critical point. We show that
   the leading behavior of mutual information at and near the critical
   point could yield a set of critical exponents if we regard it as an
   order parameter. Our result for this set of static critical exponents is
   (1/2, 1/2, 1/2, 2) which is identical to the one calculated via the
   thermodynamic quantities. Hence it suggests that beside the numerous
   merits of mutual information, this quantity also captures the critical
   behavior of the underlying field theory and it could be used as a proper
   measure to probe the phase structure associated with the strongly
   coupled systems.}},

Abstract = {{`The universe is expanding, not contracting'. Many statements of this
   form appear unambiguously true; after all, the discovery of the
   universe's expansion is one of the great triumphs of empirical science.
   However, the statement is time-directed: the universe expands towards
   what we call the future; it contracts towards the past. If we deny that
   time has a direction, should we also deny that the universe is really
   expanding? This article draws together and discusses what I call
   `C-theories' of time-in short, philosophical positions that hold time
   lacks a direction-from different areas of the literature. I set out the
   various motivations, aims and problems for C-theories, and outline
   different versions of antirealism about the direction of time.}},

Abstract = {{Key points
   tau he axonal Na+ fluorescence underlying an action potential in the
   axon initial segment was optically measured at unprecedented temporal
   resolution.
   The measurement allowed resolution of the kinetics of the Na+ current at
   different axonal locations.
   The distinct components of the Na+ current were correlated with the
   kinetics of the action potential.
   NEURON simulations from a modified published model qualitatively
   predicted the experimentally measured Na+ current.
   The present method permits the direct investigation of the kinetic
   behaviour of native Na+ channels under physiological and pathological
   conditions.
   In most neurons of the mammalian central nervous system, the action
   potential (AP) is generated in the axon initial segment (AIS) by a fast
   Na+ current mediated by voltage-gated Na+ channels. While the axonal Na+
   signal associated with the AP has been measured using fluorescent Na+
   indicators, the insufficient resolution of these recordings has not
   allowed tracking the Na+ current kinetics underlying this fundamental
   event. In this article, we report the first optical measurement of Na+
   currents in the AIS of pyramidal neurons of layer 5 of the somatosensory
   cortex from brain slices of the mouse. This measurement was obtained by
   achieving a temporal resolution of 100 mu s in the Na+ imaging
   technique, with a pixel resolution of 0.5 mu m, and by calculating the
   time-derivative of the Na+ change corrected for longitudinal diffusion.
   We identified a subthreshold current before the AP, a fast-inactivating
   current peaking during the rise of the AP and a non-inactivating current
   during the AP repolarization. We established a correlation between the
   kinetics of the non-inactivating current at different distances from the
   soma and the kinetics of the somatic AP. We quantitatively compared the
   experimentally measured Na+ current with the current obtained by
   computer simulation of published NEURON models, demonstrating how the
   present approach can lead to the correct estimate of the native
   behaviour of Na+ channels. Finally, we discuss how the present approach
   can be used to investigate the physiological or pathological function of
   different channel types during AP initiation and propagation.}},

Title = {{Large eddy simulation of an ignition sequence and the resulting steady
   combustion in a swirl-stabilized combustor using FGM-based tabulated
   chemistry}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NUMERICAL METHODS FOR HEAT \& FLUID FLOW}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1857-1883}},
Month = {{MAY 24}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   This study aims to deal with the large eddy simulation (LES) of an
   ignition sequence and the resulting steady combustion in a
   swirl-stabilized liquid-fueled combustor. Particular attention is paid
   to the ease of handling the numerical tool, the accuracy of the results
   and the reasonable computational cost involved. The primary aim of the
   study is to appraise the ability of the newly developed computational
   fluid dynamics (CFD) methodology to retrieve the spark-based flame
   kernel initiation, its propagation until the full ignition of the
   combustion chamber, the flame stabilization and the combustion processes
   governing the steady combustion regime.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The CFD model consists of an LES-based spray module coupled to a
   subgrid-scale ignition model to capture the flame kernel initiation and
   the early stage of the flame kernel growth, and a combustion model based
   on the mixture fraction-progress variable formulation in the line of the
   flamelet generated manifold (FGM) method to retrieve the subsequent
   flame propagation and combustion properties. The LES-spray module is
   based on an Eulerian-Lagrangian approach and includes a fully two-way
   coupling at each time step to account for the interactions between the
   liquid and the gaseous phases. The Wale-Adapting Large Eddy (WALE) model
   is used for the flow field while the eddy diffusivity model is used for
   the scalar fluxes. The fuel is liquid kerosene, injected in the form of
   a polydisperse spray of droplets. The spray dynamics are tracked using
   the Lagrangian procedure, and the phase transition of droplets is
   calculated using a non-equilibrium evaporation model. The oxidation
   mechanism of the Jet A-1 surrogate is described through a reduced
   reaction mechanism derived from a detailed mechanism using a species
   sensitivity method.
   Findings
   By comparing the numerical results with a set of published data for a
   swirl-stabilized spray flame, the proposed CFD methodology is found
   capable of capturing the whole spark-based ignition sequence in a
   liquid-fueled combustion chamber and the main flame characteristics in
   the steady combustion regime with reasonable computing costs.
   Research limitations/implications
   The proposed CFD methodology simulates the whole ignition sequence,
   namely, the flame kernel initiation, its propagation to fully ignite the
   combustion chamber, and the global flame stabilization. Due to the lack
   of experimental ignition data on this liquid-fueled configuration, the
   ability of the proposed CFD methodology to accurately predict ignition
   timing was not quantitatively assessed. It would, therefore, be
   interesting to apply this CFD methodology to other configurations that
   have experimental ignition data, to quantitatively assess its ability to
   predict the ignition timing and the flame characteristics during the
   ignition sequence. Such further investigations will not only provide
   further validation of the proposed methodology but also will potentially
   identify its shortfalls for better improvement.
   Practical implications
   This CFD methodology is developed by customizing a commercial CFD code
   widely used in the industry. It is, therefore, directly applicable to
   practical configurations, and provides not only a relatively
   straightforward approach to predict an ignition sequence in
   liquid-fueled combustion chambers but also a robust way to predict the
   flame characteristics in the steady combustion regime as significant
   improvements are noticed on the prediction of slow species.
   Originality/value
   The incorporation of the subgrid ignition model paired with a combustion
   model based on tabulated chemistry allows reducing computational costs
   involved in the simulation of the ignition phase. The incorporation of
   the FGM-based tabulated chemistry provides a drastic reduction of
   computing resources with reasonable accuracy. The CFD methodology is
   developed using the platform of a commercial CFD code widely used in the
   industry for relatively straightforward applicability.}},

Abstract = {{The fungal metabolite illudinine is prepared in seven steps and ca. 55\%
   overall yield from dimedone using an ``open and shut{''} (ring-opening
   and ring-closing) strategy. Tandem ring-opening fragmentation and
   olefination of dimedone establishes alkyne and vinylarene functionality
   linked by a neopentylene tether. Oxidative cycloisomerization then
   provides the illudinine framework. The key innovation in this
   second-generation synthesis of illudinine is the use of the nitrile
   functional group, rather than an ester, as the functional precursor to
   the carboxylic acid of illudinine. The small, linear nitrile (C  N) is
   associated with improved selectivity, pi-conjugation, and reactivity at
   multiple points in the synthetic sequence relative to the carboxylic
   acid ester. Preliminary assays indicate that illudinine and several
   related synthetic analogues are monoamine oxidase inhibitors, which is
   the first reported indication of biological activity associated with
   this natural product. Illudinine was found to inhibit monoamine oxidase
   B (MAO-B) with an IC50 of 18 +/- 7.1 mu M in preliminary assays.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of Erythropoietin Stimulating Agents (ESA) and Their Effect
   on Blood Optimization for Cardiac Surgery}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHARMACY PRACTICE}},
Abstract = {{Background: Cardiovascular surgeries increase the risk of receiving
   blood transfusions. Erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESAs) have been
   used to decrease the transfusion rate. The objective of this study was
   to evaluate the administration of blood products post-cardiothoracic
   surgery after receiving ESAs. Methods: This is a single-center,
   retrospective cohort study. Results: Between May 2017 to May 2018, 52
   adult patients underwent cardiac surgery and received ESAs
   pre-operatively and/or post-operatively. A total of 35 patients were
   included in the study and 21 (60\%) patients did not require a blood
   transfusion while 14 (40\%) patients required a blood transfusion (p =
   0.597). The change in hemoglobin (Hgb = 0.773 g/dL, 1.7 g/dL; p = 0.002)
   and hematocrit (Hct = 2.31\%, 4.3\%; p = 0.04) was significantly
   different in patients who received ESAs alone versus ESAs with blood
   transfusion. Adverse drug reactions showed no significant difference
   between groups. Conclusions: In patients undergoing cardiac surgery,
   ESAs did not significantly reduce the need for blood transfusion. Future
   and larger studies are necessary to evaluate the effect of ESAs on blood
   transfusion.}},

   Perspective A Systematic Literature Review}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SYSTEMS FRONTIERS}},
Abstract = {{While Universal Design principles have been adopted in many areas to
   ensure that products and services are usable for the broadest possible
   diversity of users, there is still an open area when it comes to the
   emergency management domain. This article aims at providing a systematic
   overview of the current state of the emerging research field of
   Universal Design of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for
   Emergency Management, and to highlight high-impact research
   opportunities to ensure that the increasing introduction of ICT in
   Emergency Management can contribute to removing barriers instead of
   adding more barriers, in particular for the elderly and people with
   disabilities. A systematic review on relevant literature on Universal
   Design, ICT and Emergency Management between 2008 and 2020 was employed
   using predefined frameworks, to answer the following questions: (1) Who
   are the target audiences (stakeholders) in research on Universal Design
   of ICT in Emergency Management in the different categories of Emergency
   Management ICT tools, and to what degree is Human-Centred Design and
   Universal Design taken into account? (2) What are the most important
   challenges and gaps in research on Universal Design of ICT in Emergency
   Management? We identify a set of gaps in the literature, indicating that
   there are some challenges where Universal Design is still limitedly
   addressed in technology development. We also derive promising future
   research topics based on areas that are missing in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Lymphedema results from inadequate lymphatic function
   causing swelling in subcutaneous tissues. Lymph is transported
   proximally through valved lymphatic channels and muscle contraction. The
   purpose of this study was to determine lymphatic function in
   nonambulatory patients with lower extremity neuromuscular disease.
   Methods and Results: Our Lymphedema Program database of 700 patients was
   reviewed for nonambulatory patients with lower extremity neuromuscular
   disease. Patient age, gender, disease, body mass index (BMI), and
   lymphoscintigram result were recorded. Eight patients were included in
   the study: myelomeningocele (n = 6), spinal muscle atrophy type 2 (n =
   1), Charcot Marie Tooth (n = 1). Patient ages were between 15 and 36
   years; five were female. BMI range for patients without swelling or a
   normal lymphoscintigram (n = 4) was 22-27. Four subjects with lymphatic
   dysfunction by lymphoscintigram all were obese (BMI 36-74; p = 0.03).
   Conclusions: Nonambulatory patients with lower extremity neuromuscular
   dysfunction and swelling can exhibit normal lymphatic function. Obesity
   is associated with abnormal lymphoscintigram result and lymphedema in
   this patient population. Individuals should be advised to maintain a
   normal BMI.}},

Abstract = {{The cutaneous penetration of acyclovir from the conventional topical
   formulations such as cream and ointments is poor due to low water
   solubility and low octanol buffer partition coefficient of the drug. The
   present investigation was aimed to prepare acyclovir-loaded
   microsponge-based emulgel to improve its topical delivery. The
   microsponges were prepared by the quasi-emulsion diffusion method. The
   central composite design was employed to investigate the effect of
   changes in various formulation and process parameters on critical
   product attributes. Homogenization speed (X1), drug/polymer ratio (X2),
   and concentration of PVA (X3) were selected as independent variables
   while particle size,b\% yield, \% drug loading efficiency, \% entrapment
   efficiency, the drug released at 0.25 h and 6 h were selected as
   response variables. The regression analysis proved a significant effect
   of all the independent variables on the dependent variables (p < 0.05).
   All the designed batches released more than 40\% drug in less than 1 h
   and were also able to sustain the drug release for more than 6 h. Based
   on the solution suggested by the software, the optimized batch was
   prepared with 1000-rpm homogenization speed, 1.6:1 drug/polymer ratio,
   and 0.088\% of PVA. The optimized microsponge-loaded emulgel had
   acceptable viscosity (10,897 to 12,416 centipoise), spreadability (32.5
   to 36.57 g x cm/s), pH (between 6 and 7), and drug content (93 to 95\%).
   The results of the ex vivo permeation study proved significant
   improvement in drug permeation from optimized microsponge-loaded emulgel
   compared to the marketed formulation (f2 < 50).}},

Abstract = {{Background Cetuximab plus FOLFIRI improved overall survival compared
   with bevacizumab plus FOLFIRI in KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal
   cancer (mCRC) in FIRE-3, but no corresponding benefit was found for
   progression-free survival. This analysis aimed to determine whether
   cetuximab improves response and survival versus bevacizumab among
   response-evaluable patients receiving first-line FOLFIRI for RAS
   wild-type mCRC and the effect of primary tumour side on outcomes.
   Methods The intent-to-treat population included 593 patients with KRAS
   exon 2 wild-type mCRC. Further testing identified 400 patients with
   extended RAS wild-type disease; of these, 352 (88\%) who received >= 3
   cycles of therapy and had >= 1 post-baseline scan were evaluable for
   response and constituted the per-protocol population (169 cetuximab and
   183 bevacizumab). Patients received 5-fluorouracil, folinic acid and
   irinotecan (FOLFIRI) with either weekly cetuximab or biweekly
   bevacizumab given on day 1 of each 14-day cycle until response,
   progression or toxicity occurred. The primary endpoint was the objective
   response rate (ORR) in the per-protocol population. Secondary endpoints
   included overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The
   effect of primary tumour location was evaluated. Results Median OS in
   the RAS wild-type population was 31 vs 26 months in the cetuximab and
   bevacizumab groups, respectively (HR 0.76, P = 0.012). In the
   per-protocol population, outcomes favoured cetuximab for ORR (77\% vs
   65\%, P = 0.014) and median OS (33 vs 26 months, HR 0.75, P = 0.011),
   while PFS was comparable between groups. The advantage of cetuximab over
   bevacizumab occurred only in patients with left-sided primary tumours.
   Conclusions FOLFIRI plus cetuximab resulted in a significantly higher
   ORR and longer OS compared to FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab among patients
   with left-sided tumours. The superior response associated with cetuximab
   may particularly benefit patients with symptomatic tumours or
   borderline-resectable metastases. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier
   NCT00433927.}},

Abstract = {{Antigen (Ag)-presenting cells (APC) instruct CD4+ helper T (Th) cell
   responses, but it is unclear whether different APC subsets contribute
   uniquely in determining Th differentiation in pathogen-specific
   settings. Here, we use skin-relevant, fluorescently-labeled bacterial,
   helminth or fungal pathogens to track and characterize the APC
   populations that drive Th responses in vivo. All pathogens are taken up
   by a population of IRF4+ dermal migratory dendritic cells (migDC2) that
   similarly upregulate surface co-stimulatory molecules but express
   pathogen-specific cytokine and chemokine transcripts. Depletion of
   migDC2 reduces the amount of Ag in lymph node and the development of IFN
   gamma, IL-4 and IL-17A responses without gain of other cytokine
   responses. Ag+ monocytes are an essential source of IL-12 for both
   innate and adaptive IFN gamma production, and inhibit follicular Th cell
   development. Our results thus suggest that Th cell differentiation does
   not require specialized APC subsets, but is driven by inducible and
   pathogen-specific transcriptional programs in Ag+ migDC2 and monocytes.
   Antigen presenting cells induce CD4+ T helper (Th) differentiation upon
   pathogen encounters. Here the authors use fluorescently-labeled
   bacteria, helminth and fungi to track and describe the functions of
   IRF4+ migratory type 2 dendritic cells and monocytes in the specific
   induction of Th1, Th2 or Th17 responses following skin inoculation.}},

Title = {{Comprehensive analysis of differential expression profiles via
   transcriptome sequencing in SH-SY5Y cells infected with CV-A16}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16) is one of the viruses that is most
   frequently associated with hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD). Previous
   studies have shown that CV-A16 infections are mostly self-limiting, but
   in recent years, it has been gradually found that CV-A16 infections can
   also induce neurological complications and eventually cause death in
   children with HFMD. Moreover, no curative drugs or preventative vaccines
   have been developed for CV-A16 infection. Therefore, it is particularly
   important to investigate the mechanism of CV-A16 infection-induced
   neuropathy. In the current study, transcriptome sequencing technology
   was used to identify changes in the transcriptome of SH-SY5Y cells
   infected with CV-A16, which might hide the mechanism of CV-A16-induced
   neuropathology. The transcriptome profiling showed that 82,406,974,
   108,652,260 and 97,753,565 clean reads were obtained in the Control,
   CV-A16-12 h and CV-A16-24 h groups, respectively. And it was further
   detected that a total of 136 and 161 differentially expressed genes in
   CV-A16-12 h and CV-A16-24 h groups, respectively, when compared with
   Control group. Then, to explore the mechanism of CV-A16 infection, we
   focused on the common differentially expressed genes at different time
   points of CV-A16 infection and found that there were 34 differentially
   expressed genes based on which clustering analysis and functional
   category enrichment analysis were performed. The results indicated that
   changes in oxidation levels were particularly evident in the GO term
   analysis, while only the ``Gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor
   pathway{''} was enriched in the KEGG pathway analysis, which might be
   closely related to the neurotoxicity caused by CV-A16 infection.
   Meanwhile, the ID2 closely related to nervous system has been
   demonstrated to be increased during CV-A16 infection. Additionally, the
   data on differentially expressed non-protein-coding genes of different
   types within the transcriptome sequencing results were analyzed, and it
   was speculated that these dysregulated non-protein-coding genes played a
   pivotal role in CV-A16 infection. Ultimately, qRT-PCR was utilized to
   validate the transcriptome sequencing findings, and the results of
   qRT-PCR were in agreement with the transcriptome sequencing data. In
   conclusion, transcriptome profiling was carried out to analyze response
   of SH-SY5Y cells to CV-A16 infection. And our findings provide important
   information to elucidate the possible molecular mechanisms which were
   linked to the neuropathogenesis of CV-A16 infection.}},

Abstract = {{Based on a precise biostratigraphic framework stated previously, the
   detailed sedimentological study of eight sections of the early Albian
   succession of Central Tunisia made possible to refine the modalities of
   the Albian transgression and the related behavior of sedimentary system
   on the Tunisian margin. Major early Albian transgressive pulses occurred
   (i) at the base of the L. tardefurcata standard ammonite zone, (ii)
   around the top of the same zone, (iii) during the D. mammillatum
   standard zone, and (iv) near the top of the latter ammonite zone. They
   resulted in the progressive flooding of the Tunisian margin emergent
   since the Aptian boundary, in the disappearance of emergence evidences
   through time, in the southward backstepping of the carbonate shelf
   facies, and eventually in the homogeneization of the outer shelf marly
   sedimentation in the study area. The low energy of deposition of the
   early Albian sediments in this part of the South-Tethyan margin may be
   due to the deflection of winds and storms by the Coriolis forces toward
   the North-Tethyan margin, creating a clockwise gyre in this part of the
   ocean. This circulation may have enhanced upwelling currents likely
   responsible for phosphate mineralization, and for the oxygen depletion
   of deep waters, which progressively invaded the Tunisian margin, giving
   way to organic-rich deposits of late early Albian age. The early Albian
   sedimentation is then interrupted by a major hiatus of middle Albian to
   early late Albian age.}},

Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{We study a class of geometric covering and packing problems for bounded
   closed regions on the plane. We are given a set of axis-parallel line
   segments that induce a planar subdivision with bounded (rectilinear)
   faces. We are interested in the following problems.
   (P1) STABBING-SUBDIVISION: Stab all closed bounded faces of the planar
   subdivision by selecting a minimum number of points in the plane.
   (P2) INDEPENDENT-SUBDIVISION: Select a maximum size collection of
   pairwise non-intersecting closed bounded faces of the planar
   subdivision.
   (P3) DOMINATING-SUBDIVISION: Select a minimum size collection of bounded
   faces of the planar subdivision such that every other face of the
   subdivision that is not selected has a non-empty intersection (i.e.,
   sharing an edge or a vertex) with some selected face.
   We show that these problems are NP-hard. We even prove that these
   problems are NP-hard when we concentrate only on the rectangular faces
   of the subdivision. Further, we provide constant factor approximation
   algorithms for the STABBING-SUBDIVISION problem. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Two new species of the genus Troglopedetes Joseph, 1872 (T. meridionalis
   sp. nov. and T. kae sp. nov.) are described from caves of the Thai
   peninsula. This is the first report of the genus south of the Kra
   Isthmus. The two new species have two rows of dental spines shared by
   all Thai Troglopedetes. They differ from other members of the genus
   mainly in the arrangement of dorsal chaetotaxy on head. The antennal
   chaetotaxy of the two species is analysed in detail in the second part
   of the paper. All types of antennal chaetae of both new species and
   their distribution patterns are described for each antennal segment:
   scales, ordinary chaetae, S-chaetae and subapical organite of Ant. IV.
   Twenty different types of chaetae are recognised and all except one are
   present in both species. The total numbers of ordinary chaetae and
   S-chaetae and their patterns of distribution on antenna are very similar
   between the two species (483 vs. 518 ordinary chaetae; 207 vs. 208
   S-chaetae). Each type of chaetae has its own distribution pattern,
   markedly contrasted between dorsal and ventral side of antennae, and
   between antennal segments. This diversity of morphologies and
   distribution patterns and their similarity between the two species, as
   well as differences with other species of the same family, suggest that
   antennal chaetotaxy could provide powerful new characters for the
   taxonomy of Troglopedetes and related genera.}},

Abstract = {{A set D subset of V of a graph G = (V, E) is called a neighborhood total
   dominating set of G if D is a dominating set and the subgraph of G
   induced by the open neighborhood of D has no isolated vertex. Given a
   graph G, MIN-NTDS is the problem of finding a neighborhood total
   dominating set of G of minimum cardinality. The decision version of
   MIN-NTDS is known to be NP-complete for bipartite graphs and chordal
   graphs. In this paper, we extend this NP-completeness result to
   undirected path graphs, chordal bipartite graphs, and planar graphs. We
   also present a linear time algorithm for computing a minimum
   neighborhood total dominating set in proper interval graphs. We show
   that for a given graph G = (V, E), MIN-NTDS cannot be approximated
   within a factor of (1 - epsilon) log vertical bar V vertical bar, unless
   NP subset of DTIME(vertical bar V vertical bar(O(loglog vertical bar V
   vertical bar))) and can be approximated within a factor of O(log Delta),
   where Delta is the maximum degree of the graph G. Finally, we show that
   MIN-NTDS is APX-complete for graphs of degree at most 3. (C) 2020

Pages = {{12690-12696}},

Abstract = {{In this study, dimethylol propionic acid (DMPA) and ethoxylated polymer
   diol (N120) are incorporated as composite hydrophilic groups to
   synthesize a series of castor oil-based waterborne polyurethane (CWPU)
   nano-emulsions. The properties of the nano-emulsions with different
   ratio of polybutylene adipate (PBA) and castor oil (CO) soft segments as
   well as their film are investigated systematically. Fourier infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR) confirms that CO was successfully introduced into
   the waterborne polyurethane (WPU) structure. The result indicates that
   the maximum contact angle of the film is 75.51 degrees with a 7/3 molar
   ratio of PBA/CO. Thermal Gravimetric Analyzer (TGA) and Dynamic
   thermomechanical analysis (DMA) tests show that the thermal stability of
   the films has gradually improved with the increase of castor oil
   content. The content of castor oil in CWPU also affects the mechanical
   properties of the film. The tensile strength of the film reaches 23.2
   MPa, and the elongation at break is 1460.7 \%, when the molar ratio of
   PBA/CO is 9/1. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is used to express the
   surface morphology of CWPU films. The films surface become rougher due
   to the introduction of CO. This work combines castor oil and water-based
   systems to provide a relatively simple preparation method to synthesize
   CWPU nano-emulsions, which can be used in environmental protection
   coatings and adhesives, and has broader application prospects.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Microdeletion syndromes occur from deletion of 5Mb of a
   chromosome in approximately 5\% of patients with unexplained
   intellectual disability. Interstitial microdeletions at bands 1p33 and
   1p32.2 of the short arm of chromosome 1 are rare and have not been
   previously reported in relation to disease. Patient concerns: We present
   a case of a 39-month boy with Pierre Robin sequence, development
   delay/intellectual disability, growth retardation, short stature,
   leukoencephalopathy, craniofacial dysplasia, and speech delay. The child
   was referred to the Child health care department in October 2014 for his
   delayed language development and aggravated aggression. Diagnosis:
   Molecular diagnostic testing with G-band karyotyping was normal but
   clinical microarray analysis detected a 10 Mb microdeletion at
   1p33p32.2. Interventions: The patient received rehabilitation. Outcomes:
   Three candidate genes were pinpointed to the deleted area, including
   ORC1, SCP2, and DAB1. Phenotype-genotype analysis suggested that these
   three genes are likely to be responsible for the main phenotypes
   observed in the patient, such as microcephaly, growth retardation, short
   stature, leukoencephalopathy, and development delay/intellectual
   disability. Conclusions: The spectrum of phenotypes this case presented
   with are likely to be caused by 1p33p32.2 deletion which could represent
   a new microdeletion syndrome.}},

Abstract = {{We show that the electron recoil excess around 2 keV claimed by the

   Those particles cannot be part of the cold DM halo of our Galaxy, so we
   speculate about their possible nature and origin, such as fast-moving DM
   subhalos, semiannihilations of DM and relativistic axions produced by a
   nearby axion star. Feasible new physics scenarios must accommodate
   exotic DM dynamics and unusual DM properties.}},

Abstract = {{The present study deals with the synthesis of ZnO and Ag-ZnO
   nanoparticles using Excoecaria agallocha leaf extract under a controlled
   ultrasound cavitation technique. The characterization of the
   as-synthesized ZnO and Ag-ZnO nanoparticles (different molar
   concentration of Ag) were subjected to Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), UV-Visible
   Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS), Thermogravimetric
   analysis (TGA), N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherm (BET), scanning
   electron microscopy(SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The
   photocatalytic performance of ZnO and Ag-ZnO nanoparticles as catalysts
   were studied for hazardous organic dyes such as methylene blue (MB) and
   rhodamine-B (Rh-B) under solar light irradiation. The degradation study
   follows pseudo-first-order kinetics. The effective degradation of MB was
   found to be 56.44 \% (ZnO nanoparticles) and 98.44 \% Ag-ZnO
   nanoparticles, respectively at 100 min at the molar ratio (0.25 : 1).
   Whereas, Rh-B shows 27.50 \% (ZnO nanoparticles) and 98.83 \% at the
   same molar ratio of Ag-ZnO nanoparticles at 80 min. Among the
   as-synthesized nanoparticles, Ag-ZnO at molar ratio 0.25 : 1 shows
   effective photocatalytic activity. Besides these as-synthesized
   nanoparticles exhibited good antimicrobial activity with an increase in
   Ag nanoparticles decorated into ZnO. A similar trend was observed in
   antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity.}},

   T4 DNA ligase efficiently recognizes the Ds-Pa pairing at the

   allowed in enzymatic ligation with higher cognate base-pair selectivity,

Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{Real-time observation of the emergence of coherent structures from noise
   via instabilities is of particular interest across disciplines ranging
   from biology to astrophysics. In the context of photonics, ultrafast
   fibre lasers provide an ideal test-bed for experimental observation of
   dynamical instabilities and generation of coherent structures of
   ultrashort pulses. Here we present experimentally obtained switch-on
   dynamics of counter-propagating ultrashort pulses in a bidirectional
   mode-locked fibre laser with delayed pulse formation via Q-switched and
   modulation instabilities, pronounced central wavelength drift, with the
   multiple-pulse formation. We define a localisation parameter using the
   round-trip resolved autocorrelation function to quantify the extent of
   the pulse formation, indicating an energy interchange between coherent
   features and background radiation. Furthermore, we report the formation
   of synchronised and unsynchronised dispersion waves. Our results reveal
   the complexity of the establishment of coherent features and their
   interaction with background radiation, contributing further towards the
   understanding of nonlinear systems in general. Emergent coherence in
   noisy, nonlinear systems of broad scientific relevance can be examined
   in real-time in optical analogues. Here, the complex dynamics of
   counter-propagating coherent pulses is examined, revealing how energy is
   exchanged between both channels and background radiation.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},

Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{In this article, we compared the content validity of two instruments
   used in measuring pediatric pain knowledge and attitudes. This was
   considered necessary due to the universal differences in culture,
   semantics and healthcare resources in different parts of the globe.
   Thirteen (13) pediatric experts in Ghana assessed the content validity
   of two instruments: the 42-item Pediatric Nurses' Knowledge and
   Attitudes Survey Regarding Pain (PNKAS) and the 41-item Pediatric
   Healthcare Providers' Knowledge and Attitudes Survey Regarding Pain
   (PHPKASRP). The relevance and clarity of each item on these instruments
   were rated on a four-point likert scaled options from 1 (not relevant/
   not clear) to 4 (very relevant/ very clear). The item-level content
   validity index (I-CVI) was calculated by dividing the number of experts
   who rated an item with 3 or 4 by the total number of experts. The
   average scale-level content validity index (S-CVI/Ave) was also
   estimated by summing up the I-CVIs of all items and dividing them by the
   total number of items. The I-CVIs on the PNKAS ranged from 0.62 to 1.00
   for the relevance component and 0.69 to 1.00 for the clarity component.
   The I-CVIs on the PHPKASRP ranged from 0.62 to 1.00 for both the
   relevance and clarity components. The S-CVI/Ave were 0.87 and 0.89 for
   the relevance and clarity aspects on the PNKAS respectively. The
   S-CVI/Ave for the PHPKASRP instrument were 0.86 and 0.89 for the
   relevance and clarity aspects correspondingly. At the end of the
   validation process, 5 items were revised on both instruments whilst 37
   and 36 items were maintained on the PNKAS and PHPKASRP instruments
   respectively. The PNKAS and PHPKASRP have an acceptable level of content
   validity in the Ghanaian context and recommended for educational and
   research purposes. Other forms of validity and reliability of these
   instruments should also be examined in future studies.}},

Journal = {{TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{The gut microbiota is an essential regulator of many aspects of host
   physiology. Disruption of gut microbial communities affects gut-brain
   communication which ultimately can manifest as changes in brain function
   and behaviour. Transient changes in gut microbial composition can be
   induced by various intrinsic and extrinsic factors, however, it is
   possible that enduring shifts in the microbiota composition can be
   achieved by perturbation at a timepoint when the gut microbiota has not
   fully matured or is generally unstable, such as during early life or
   ageing. In this study, we investigated the effects of 3-week microbiota
   depletion with antibiotic treatment during the adolescent period and in
   adulthood. Following a washout period to restore the gut microbiota,
   behavioural and molecular hallmarks of gut-brain communication were
   investigated. Our data revealed that transient microbiota depletion had
   long-lasting effects on microbiota composition and increased
   anxiety-like behaviour in mice exposed to antibiotic treatment during
   adolescence but not in adulthood. Similarly, gene expression in the
   amygdala was more severely affected in mice treated during adolescence.
   Taken together these data highlight the vulnerability of the gut
   microbiota during the critical adolescent period and the long-lasting
   impact manipulations of the microbiota can have on gene expression and
   behaviour in adulthood.}},

Abstract = {{Discrete dimethylsiloxane oligomers are interesting building blocks for
   the synthesis of high chi-low N block co-oligomers (BCOs) forming highly
   organized nanostructures. Here, a practical guide to the synthesis of
   molecularly defined oligodimethylsiloxanes (oDMS) from 7-mer to 40-mer
   via a linear growth strategy is described. The iteration of a
   hydroxylation reaction and the condensation of mono- or bifunctional
   hydroxysiloxanes with chloro-octamethyltetrasiloxane results in
   asymmetric and symmetric siloxanes, respectively. The synthesis contains
   critical washing and purification steps to remove minor amounts of low
   and high-molecular weight byproducts, which are detected using Fourier
   transform infrared spectrometry, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry,
   and size-exclusion chromatography. The oligomers are obtained on a
   multigram scale in yields of 94-50\% and in high purity with only one
   molar mass detected. The formation of the chloride, hydroxide or hydride
   functional groups is adequately analyzed using Si-29 NMR spectroscopy.
   The hydride terminated siloxane oligomers are used in Karstedt catalyzed
   hydrosilylation reactions with alkene-functional substrates to obtain
   oDMS-based oligomers and BCOs. Byproduct formation as a result of
   isomerization and reduction are followed by H-1 NMR spectroscopy and
   minimized using dry conditions and low-catalyst loadings.}},

Abstract = {{The Korean Wave provides an effective vehicle for implicit cultural

   understanding of the prevailing discourse of youth in contemporary Korea
   and how this is naturalised across the boundaries of policy, business,
   media and fandom. The implicit cultural policy formulates a desirable
   self in a `Korean style' by highlighting some of the psychological
   qualities of post-industrial creative workers and exploring Korean
   society's existing inventory of the productive ethic and Confucian
   ideals. The juxtaposition of post-industrial and industrial ethics, and
   the tension between entrepreneurial self and collective self, impose a
   double burden on youth, leaving them little scope to contest the

Volume = {{127}},

Pages = {{1384-1400}},
Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{Rationale:
   Diabetic heart disease (DHD) is a debilitating manifestation of type 2
   diabetes mellitus. Exercise has been proposed as a potential therapy for
   DHD, although the effectiveness of exercise in preventing or reversing
   the progression of DHD remains controversial. Cardiac function is
   critically dependent on the preservation of coronary vascular function.
   Objective:
   We aimed to elucidate the effectiveness and mechanisms by which exercise
   facilitates coronary and cardiac-protection during the onset and
   progression of DHD.
   Methods and Results:
   Diabetic db/db and nondiabetic mice, with or without underlying cardiac
   dysfunction (16 and 8 weeks old, respectively) were subjected to either
   moderate-intensity exercise or high-intensity exercise for 8 weeks.
   Subsequently, synchrotron microangiography, immunohistochemistry,
   Western blot, and real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to
   assess time-dependent changes in cardiac and coronary structure and
   function associated with diabetes mellitus and exercise and determine
   whether these changes reflect the observed changes in cardiac-enriched
   and vascular-enriched microRNAs (miRNAs). We show that, if exercise is
   initiated from 8 weeks of age, both moderate-intensity exercise and
   high-intensity exercise prevented the onset of coronary and cardiac
   dysfunction, apoptosis, fibrosis, microvascular rarefaction, and
   disruption of miRNA signaling, as seen in the nonexercised diabetic
   mice. Conversely, the cardiovascular benefits of moderate-intensity
   exercise were absent if the exercise was initiated after the diabetic
   mice had already established cardiac dysfunction (ie, from 16 weeks of
   age). The experimental silencing or upregulation of miRNA-126 activity
   suggests the mechanism underpinning the cardiovascular benefits of
   exercise were mediated, at least in part, through tissue-specific
   miRNAs.
   Conclusions:
   Our findings provide the first experimental evidence for the critical
   importance of early exercise intervention in ameliorating the onset and
   progression of DHD. Our results also suggest that the beneficial effects
   of exercise are mediated through the normalization of
   cardiovascular-enriched miRNAs, which are dysregulated in DHD.}},

Abstract = {{Aim The purpose of this study was to develop and validate an
   individualized nomogram to predict venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk in
   hospitalized postoperative breast cancer patients.
   Design A single-central retrospective and non-interventional trial.
   Methods For model development, we used data from 4,755 breast cancer
   patients between 1 November 2016-30 June 2018 (3,310 patients in the
   development group and 1,445 in the validation group). Overall, 216
   patients developed VTE (150 in development group and 66 in validation
   group). The model was validated by receiver operating characteristic
   curves and the calibration plot. The clinical utility of the model was
   determined through decision curve analysis.
   Results The individualized nomogram consisted of six clinical factors:
   age, body mass index, number of cardiovascular comorbidities,
   neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgical treatment, hospital length of stay
   and two pre-operative biomarkers of Homocysteine and D-dimer. The model
   at the 3.9\% optimal cut-off had the area under the curve of 0.854 (95\%
   CI, 0.824-0.884) and 0.805 (95\% CI, 0.740-0.870) in the development and
   validation groups. A p = 0.570 of the calibration test showed that the
   model was well-calibrated. The net benefit of the model was better
   between threshold probabilities of 5\%-30\% in decision curve analysis.
   Conclusion The nomogram of VTE risk assessment, is applicable to
   hospitalized postoperative breast cancer patients. However,
   multi-central prospective studies are needed to improve and validate the
   model. Effectiveness and safety of thromboprophylaxis in high-risk
   patients are needed to demonstrate in interventional trials.
   Impact This nomogram can be used in clinical to inform practice of
   physicians and nurses to predict the VTE probability and maybe direct
   personalized decision making for thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized
   postoperative breast cancer patients.}},

Title = {{One-Year Analysis of Risk Factors Associated With Cognitive Impairment
   in Newly Diagnosed Epilepsy in Adults}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{Cognitive impairment (CI) occurs in people with epilepsy, affecting
   their quality of life. This study aimed to identify factors associated
   with CI in adult patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy. Additionally,
   we sought to determine whether any particular cognitive function is
   impaired predominantly by anti-seizure medications or by other factors.
   We enrolled 229 patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy and 191
   participants were followed up for 1 y. We used the Montreal Cognitive
   Assessment as a tool to quantify CI. The sub-item scores were also
   collected to assess whether any aspects of CI are predominantly affected
   by anti-seizure medication treatment. Subjective memory decline due to
   anti-seizure medications was also recorded. One-hundred-and-two
   participants (44.5\%) had CI onset before anti-seizure medication
   treatment. Aging, low education level, stroke or brain surgery etiology,
   and anxious symptoms were identified as risk factors for CI before
   anti-seizure medications use. Brain surgery for the young, anxious
   status for the middle-aged, and depressive status for the elderly were
   risk factors for CI at different ages. The elderly PWE had worse memory
   than the others. PWE with TLE had worse cognition, especially in memory
   and naming. The overall impact of anti-seizure medications on cognition
   was mild. Refractory epilepsy was a predictor of cognitive decline.
   Subjective memory decline was predicted by high-risk treatment and by a
   finding of refractory epilepsy. Clarifying the risk factors for CI can
   help the physician to assess the probable risk of CI for each individual
   before the start of anti-seizure medication treatment, which may lead to
   better compliance.}},

Title = {{Error Signal Differential Term Feedback Enhanced Variable Step Size
   FxLMS Algorithm for Piezoelectric Active Vibration Control}},
Journal = {{SHOCK AND VIBRATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{FxLMS (Filtered-x Least Mean Square) algorithm is widely used in the
   field of AVC (active vibration control) for its good convergence and
   strong adaptability. However, the convergence rate and steady-state
   error are mutually restricted for the fixed step FxLMS algorithm.
   Increasing step size mu to accelerate the convergence rate will result
   in larger steady-state error and even cause control divergence. In this
   paper, a new DVSFxLMS (error signal Differential term feedback Variable
   Step size FxLMS) algorithm is proposed by establishing nonlinear
   function between mu and error signal, while using differential term of
   the error signal as the feedback control function. Subsequently, a
   DVSFxLMS controller is designed to carry out the AVC simulation and
   experiments on cantilever beam with PSA (piezoelectric stack actuator).
   Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed DVSFxLMS
   algorithm has faster convergence rate and smaller steady-state error
   than the traditional FxLMS algorithm, which also has strong antinoise
   ability and adaptive control ability to quickly track the variable
   external disturbance.}},

Journal = {{NEUROCOMPUTING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{413}},

Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{Motion averaging has recently been introduced as an effective means to
   tackle the registration of multiview range scans. This approach can view
   parts of pair-wise motions with high reliability as an input to estimate
   the global motions for a multi-view registration. However, reliable
   pair-wise motions are not easy to confirm in most practical applications
   without prior knowledge. In this paper, we propose an adaptive low-rank
   sparse (LRS) weighted motion averaging method for a robust and accurate
   multiview registration, which can directly reconstruct high-quality 3D
   shape models from a set of unordered range scans. Specifically, we first
   introduce LRS matrix decomposition to automatically compute the initial
   global motions. The LRS matrix decomposition can recover the initial
   global models through the full exploration of a set of pair-wise
   motions. Subsequently, we extend the motion averaging with an adaptive
   weight computation by developing an optimization strategy using the
   Lagrange multiplier method, which can adaptively compute the weights of
   the reliability for each pair-wise relative motion. Accordingly, the
   proposed method can recover accurate and robust global motions in a set
   of iterations through weighted motion averaging. Experimental results on
   several public datasets demonstrate the excellent performance of the
   proposed method in comparison with state-of-the-art multi-view
   registration and 3D scene reconstruction. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The co-combustion of sewage sludge and biomass is a key problem in
   coal-fired power plants. The combustion characteristics and pollutant
   emissions of municipal sewage sludge and biomass could result in
   unpredictable operation and environmental problems. In this study, the
   combustion experiments of corn stalk (CS), municipal sewage sludge (SS),
   and their blends were conducted in the thermogravimetric analyzer and
   muffle furnace, focusing on the combustion characteristics and the
   pollutants (SO2/NO) emissions with different temperature, proportion,
   and heating rate. It was found that the combustion characteristics of
   the mixture are affected by the mix ratio of SS. Compared with those of
   SS, the SO2 emission amount and S-SO2 conversion rate of CS are lower.
   The content of N in SS is higher than CS, but the conversion rate of
   N-NO is lower. Although the emissions of SO2 and NO from CS blending
   with SS are higher than those from CS combustion alone, the conversion
   rate of SO2 and NO decreases. This means that the co-combustion of CS
   and SS will reduce the content of pollutants released by CS combustion
   alone and effectively solve the environmental problems associated with
   CS incineration.}},

Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{31}},

Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{2D BCN material consisting of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride
   (h-BN) has received extensive attention due to its abundant electronic
   properties and promising applications. The actual applications of 2D BCN
   require that there be precise control over its electronic properties.
   Using density functional theory calculations, we systematically
   investigate the electronic structure and effective mass of 2D BCN under
   biaxial strain. It is demonstrated that the band gap of zigzag BCNs
   decreases monotonously as the tensile strain increases. Moreover, the
   system exhibits a similar trend, regardless of the C/h-BN ratio. In
   sharp contrast, the band gap of armchair BCNs depends on the C/h-BN
   ratio. Specifically, the band gap of C-2(BN)(4)decreases significantly,
   while the band gap of C-3(BN)(3)and C-4(BN)(2)initially remains almost
   unchanged and then increases with increasing biaxial strain in armchair
   BCNs. In addition, it is found that the effective masses of the electron
   and hole of BCNs can be effectively modulated by the biaxial strain. Our
   results suggest a new route to control the electronic properties of 2D
   BCN and may also facilitate the realization of electronic devices based
   on 2D BCN material.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{In this work, attapulgite (ATP)-based dual sensitive poly
   (N-isopropylacrylamide-co-acrylic acid) composite hydrogel,
   P(NIPAM-co-AA)/ATP, was prepared by free radical polymerization. The
   prepared composite hydrogel was characterized via methods of scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
   (FT-IR), zeta potential analysis and Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller (BET)
   etc. The composite hydrogel showed pH and temperature sensitive
   behaviour, with lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of 35 degrees
   C and highest swelling occurred at pH 8.0. The adsorption of methyl
   violet (MV) can be controlled by the hydrogel responsiveness, and
   95.78\% of MV can be removed at pH 8.0 and 35 degrees C. The addition of
   a small amount of ATP (3 Wt\%) can improve the swelling ratio and
   adsorption capacity. Kinetic analysis demonstrated that the experimental
   data were best fitted to the pseudo-second order model. Isotherm
   analysis showed that the equilibrium data followed Langmuir model with
   the adsorption capacity of 168.35 mg g(-1). In addition, the composite
   hydrogel has high adsorption selectivity for cationic dyes, and
   MV-loaded hydrogel is easy to regenerate, which can be used for
   successive adsorption cycles. These results demonstrate that the
   composite hydrogel has potential application in dye wastewater
   treatment.}},

Abstract = {{While the inclusive focus of the First World War centenary has restored
   many marginalised stories to local and global narratives, most New
   Zealanders remain unaware of their nation's official First World War art
   collection. The artworks produced for this collection were meant to act
   as both documentation of the New Zealand forces and as sites of
   commemoration for the nation's sacrifice. They were intended for display
   inside a national war museum that was planned but never built; instead,
   the collection was placed into storage within the Dominion Museum and
   later the National Art Gallery. It has rarely been exhibited. By the
   1960s, the collection's cultural significance remained so unacknowledged
   that several works were almost destroyed. After being transferred to
   Archives New Zealand in 1981, the entire collection was digitised and
   made available online-granting the works an unprecedented level of
   accessibility. This article interrogates some of the reasons the
   collection failed to find its audience and achieve any significant level
   of cultural relevance across its hundred-year history. In particular, it
   examines how each shift in the collection's evolution-from artwork to
   artefact to archive-has transformed its functional meaning and poses
   questions about its future within war remembrance practices.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose We aimed to explore the role of drugs re-challenge at the
   disease progression after a chemotherapy-free interval for pancreatic
   adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients. Methods We retrospectively analyzed the
   outcome of re-treatments at the progression in two cohorts of advanced
   PDAC patients who had disease control (DC) and a treatment holiday >= 3
   months after upfront chemotherapy. Results Between 2015 and 2019, 66
   advanced PDAC patients (cohort A) had DC with nab-paclitaxel-based
   chemotherapy (i.e. AG or PAXG = cisplatin, nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine,
   capecitabine). At the time of progressive disease (PD), 34 patients were
   re-treated with AG (A1) and 32 were treated with other regimens (A2).
   The median (m) duration of chemotherapy holiday was 6.1 and 5.9 months
   in A1 and A2, respectively. Partial response (PR) and stable disease
   (SD) were found in 14 (41\%) and 12 (35\%) of patients in A1 and in 8
   (25\%) and 6 (19\%) patients in A2. CA19-9 response was recorded in
   23/33 evaluable patients (70\%) in A1 and in 5/20 (25\%) in A2. mPFS2
   and mOS2, defined as the time between the second line of treatment start
   and the disease progression or death, were 4.8 and 12.2 months in A1 and
   3.9 and 8.4 months in A2, respectively. Similarly, between 2006 and
   2013, 64 patients (cohort B) had DC with upfront PEFG/PEXG/PDXG regimens
   (epirubicin or docetaxel, cisplatin, gemcitabine, capecitabine or
   5-fluorouracil) and were re-treated at PD with either 4-drug (B1; N =
   30) or other regimens (B2; N = 34), yielding a mOS2 of 10.9 and 7.2
   months, respectively. Conclusion Our data endorse the strategy of
   resuming prior drugs after a chemotherapy holiday >= 3 months in
   advanced PDAC patients who achieved a durable disease control after
   upfront treatments.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of Antemortem Diagnostic Techniques in Goats Naturally
   Infected With Scrapie}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{Scrapie is a naturally occurring transmissible spongiform encephalopathy
   (TSE) that affects sheep and goats. Sheep and goats can be infected with
   scrapie as lambs or kids via contact with the placenta or placental
   fluids, or from ingestion of prions shed in the environment and/or
   bodily fluids (e.g., saliva, urine, and feces). Like other TSEs, scrapie
   is generally not diagnosed before extensive and irreversible brain
   damage has occurred. Therefore, a reliable method to screen animals may
   facilitate diagnosis. Additionally, while natural scrapie in sheep has
   been widely described, naturally acquired goat scrapie is less
   well-characterized. The purpose of this study was to better understand
   natural goat scrapie in regard to disease phenotype (i.e., incubation
   period, clinical signs, neuroanatomical deposition patterns of PrPSc,
   and molecular profile as detected by Western blot) and to evaluate the
   efficacy of antemortem tests to detect scrapie-positive animals in a
   herd of goats. Briefly, 28 scrapie-exposed goats were removed from a
   farm depopulated due to previous diagnoses of scrapie on the premises
   and observed daily for 30 months. Over the course of the observation
   period, antemortem biopsies of recto-anal mucosa-associated lymphoid
   tissue (RAMALT) were taken and tested using immunohistochemistry and
   real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC), and retinal thickness
   was measured in vivo using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Following
   the observation period, immunohistochemistry and Western blot were
   performed to assess neuroanatomical deposition patterns of PrPSc and
   molecular profile. Our results demonstrate that antemortem rectal biopsy
   was 77\% effective in identifying goats naturally infected with scrapie
   and that a positive antemortem rectal biopsy was associated with the
   presence of clinical signs of neurologic disease and a positive dam
   status. We report that changes in retinal thickness are not detectable
   over the course of the observation period in goats naturally infected
   with scrapie. Finally, our results indicate that the accumulation of
   PrPSc in central nervous system (CNS) and non-CNS tissues is consistent
   with previous reports of scrapie in sheep and goats.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial cellulose (BC) is a biodegradable polymer that benefits in
   purity, crystallinity and superior optical, structural and mechanical
   properties. Such properties facilitate BC to replace the conventional
   non-biodegradable materials used, for instance, in sensing applications.
   However, BC production is largely conducted in conventional medium
   containing model substrates and complex carbon-containing compounds.
   Aiming towards the production of eco-friendly piezoelectric-responsive
   BC films, we isolated and characterized a novel bacterial strain
   affiliated to Komagataeibacter rhaeticus. The K. rhaeticus ENS9a strain
   synthesized BC in minimal medium containing crude glycerol, generating a
   titer of 2.9 +/- 0.3 g/L BC. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the
   highest BC titer reported from an unoptimized minimal medium containing
   crude glycerol. Interestingly, the films prepared from crude glycerol
   showed normal force and bending mode sensitivities of 6-11 pC/N and
   40-71 pC/N, respectively, demonstrating a green platform to address both
   bioprocess waste valorization and implementation of cellulose-based
   alternatives for the non-sustainable and non-biodegradable materials,
   such as fluoropolymers or lead containing piezoceramics, used in sensing
   applications. In silico genome analysis predicted genes partaking in
   carbohydrate metabolism, BC biogenesis, and nitrogen
   fixation/regulation.}},

Abstract = {{It cannot be overemphasised that healthcare institutions are mandated to
   ensure that health records are properly filed, archived, stored,
   disposed and retrievable using appropriate system as required by
   legislation, and that appropriate security measures are in place to
   ensure secured health records in the healthcare workflow and storages.
   The study was partially extracted from the author's PhD research
   dissertation completed in 2016, to investigate a typical framework for
   management of patients records on the healthcare service delivery
   practice following the records life cycle for quality patients care.
   This multimethod study used stratified random sampling method to collect
   quantitative data using questionnaire. Sample was drawn from records
   management officials in 40 hospitals of Limpopo Province in South
   Africa. The statistical data in questionnaire was supported with a
   triangulation of data from observation and document/system analysis to
   clarify statistical information. The study discovered that medical
   records were not properly managed at different stages of the records
   life cycle during healthcare service workflow. The study recommended a
   strategic framework that may be adopted by the healthcare institutions
   to improve manageability of their medical information, with an
   electronic record tracking system for file content management and
   records movement tracking. This will assist healthcare institutions in
   taking care of the file content completeness in case they maintain
   creation of information contained in paper-based records. They will also
   able to track the location of each file while also keeping track record
   of the file usage (audit trail) for user accountability.}},

Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{The emergence of resistant bacterial strains mainly due to misuse of
   antibiotics has seriously affected our ability to treat bacterial
   illness, and the development of new classes of potent antimicrobial
   agents is desperately needed. In this study, we report the efficient
   synthesis of a new pyrazoline-pyridine containing ligand L1 which acts
   as an NN-donor for the formation of a novel silver (I) complex 2. The
   free ligand did not show antibacterial activity. High potency was
   exhibited by the complex against three Gram-negative bacteria, namely
   Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanii with
   the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranging between 4 and 16 mu
   g/mL (4.2-16.7 mu M), and excellent activity against the fungi Candida
   albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans (MIC <= 0.25 mu g/mL = 0.26 mu M).
   Moreover, no hemolytic activity within the tested concentration range
   was observed. In addition to the planktonic growth inhibition, the
   biofilm formation of both Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
   (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was significantly reduced by the
   complex at MIC concentrations in a dose-dependent manner for Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa, whereas a biphasic response was obtained for MRSA showing
   that the sub-MIC doses enhanced biofilm formation before its reduction
   at higher concentration. Finally, complex 2 exhibited strong DNA binding
   with a large drop in DNA viscosity indicating the absence of classical
   intercalation and suggesting the participation of the silver ion in DNA
   binding which may be related to its antibacterial activity. Taken
   together, the current results reveal that the pyrazoline-pyridine silver
   complexes are of high interest as novel antibacterial agents, justifying
   further in vitro and in vivo investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Our patient was a 69-year-old woman admitted to our hospital for heavy
   proteinuria and hematuria. A renal biopsy showed findings similar to
   those of membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis associated with
   nodular lesions, and immunofluorescence showed marked deposits of IgG,
   C1q, and C3 on the peripheral capillary walls. IgG3 alone was observed
   on IgG subclass staining with no kappa or lambda light chains, and Congo
   red staining was negative. These findings suggested IgG3-heavy-chain
   deposition disease (HCDD). However, we did not find a deletion of the
   first heavy-chain constant domain, which is commonly observed in HCDD.
   Electron microscopy showed randomly arranged subendothelial microtubular
   structures with diameters of 70-90 nm. Altogether, the diagnosis of HCDD
   could not be made, although monoclonal IgG3 deposits in glomeruli were
   observed. This is the first case report of monoclonal IgG3-heavy-chain
   glomerulonephritis with subendothelial-based, randomly arranged
   microtubular structures with diameters of 70-90 nm.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{Plasmodium parasites possess a translocon that exports parasite proteins
   into the infected erythrocyte. Although the translocon components are
   also expressed during the mosquito and liver stage of infection, their
   function remains unexplored. Here, using a combination of genetic and
   chemical assays, we show that the translocon component Exported Protein
   2 (EXP2) is critical for invasion of hepatocytes. EXP2 is a pore-forming
   protein that is secreted from the sporozoite upon contact with the host
   cell milieu. EXP2-deficient sporozoites are impaired in invasion, which
   can be rescued by the exogenous administration of recombinant EXP2 and
   alpha-hemolysin (an S. aureus pore-forming protein), as well as by acid
   sphingomyelinase. The latter, together with the negative impact of
   chemical and genetic inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase on invasion,
   reveals that EXP2 pore-forming activity induces hepatocyte membrane
   repair, which plays a key role in parasite invasion. Overall, our
   findings establish a novel and critical function for EXP2 that leads to
   an active participation of the host cell in Plasmodium sporozoite
   invasion, challenging the current view of the establishment of liver
   stage infection. While the role of Plasmodium EXP2 protein as translocon
   component of blood stage parasites is established, its functional role
   in liver stage parasites remains unclear. Here, Mello-Vieira et al.
   reveal that EXP2 pore-forming activity induces hepatocyte membrane
   repair and hence is critical for hepatocyte invasion.}},

   mechanistic route. Proceeding over a radical mechanism without
   dimerization, it clearly stands out from classical (Non-)Kolbe
   electrolysis. In the presence of non-toxic aqueous solvents, the desired
   products form in excellent yields (up to 83 \%), which are the highest
   reported for this substrate class. Once feasibility had been shown for
   the electrolysis of methylsuccinic acid, we could demonstrate its

Title = {{Identification of Novel BRCA1 and RAD50 Mutations Associated With Breast
   Cancer Predisposition in Tunisian Patients}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN GENETICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Deleterious mutations on BRCA1/2 genes are known to confer high risk of
   developing breast and ovarian cancers. The identification of these
   mutations not only helped in selecting high risk individuals that need
   appropriate prevention approaches but also led to the development of the
   PARP-inhibitors targeted therapy. This study aims to assess the
   prevalence of the most frequent BRCA1 mutation in Tunisia, c.211dupA,
   and provide evidence of its common origin as well as its
   clinicopathological characteristics. We also aimed to identify
   additional actionable variants using classical and next generation
   sequencing technologies (NGS) which would allow to implement
   cost-effective genetic testing in limited resource countries.
   Patients and Methods
   Using sanger sequencing, 112 breast cancer families were screened for
   c.211dupA. A set of patients that do not carry this mutation were
   investigated using NGS. Haplotype analysis was performed to assess the
   founder effect and to estimate the age of this mutation. Correlations
   between genetic and clinical data were also performed.
   Results
   The c.211dupA mutation was identified in 8 carriers and a novel private
   BRCA1 mutation, c.2418dupA, was identified in one carrier. Both
   mutations are likely specific to North-Eastern Tunisia. Haplotype
   analysis supported the founder effect of c.211dupA and showed its recent
   origin. Phenotype-genotype correlation showed that both BRCA1 mutations
   seem to be associated with a severe phenotype. Whole Exome Sequencing
   (WES) analysis of a BRCA negative family revealed a Variant of Unknown
   Significance, c.3647C > G on RAD50. Molecular modeling showed that this
   variant could be classified as deleterious as it is responsible for
   destabilizing the RAD50 protein structure. Variant prioritization and
   pathway analysis of the WES data showed additional interesting candidate
   genes including MITF and ANKS6.
   Conclusion
   We recommend the prioritization of BRCA1-c.211dupA screening in high
   risk breast cancer families originating from the North-East of Tunisia.
   We also highlighted the importance of NGS in detecting novel mutations,
   such as RAD50-c.3647C > G. In addition, we strongly recommend using data
   from different ethnic groups to review the pathogenicity of this variant
   and reconsider its classification in ClinVar.}},

Abstract = {{We use an entanglement measure that respects the superselection of

   two filled edge states have the potential to realize genuine,
   nonbipartite, many-body entanglement that can be transferred to a
   quantum register. The entanglement is extractable when the filled edge
   states are sufficiently localized on the lattice sites controlled by the
   users. We show, furthermore, that the onset of entanglement between the
   edges can be inferred from local particle number spectroscopy alone and
   present an experimental protocol to study the breaking of Bell's

Title = {{How often do US-based schizophrenia papers published in high-impact
   psychiatric journals report on race and ethnicity?: A 20-year update of
   Lewine and Caudle (1999)}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Racial and ethnic disparities have been clearly documented in
   schizophrenia studies, but it is unclear how much research attention
   they receive among US-based studies published in high-impact journals.
   Aims
   The current paper updates Lewine and Caudle's (1999) and Chakraborty and
   Steinhauer's (2010) works, which quantified how frequently schizophrenia
   studies included information on race and ethnicity in their analyses.
   Method
   We examined all US-based papers on schizophrenia-spectrum, first-episode
   psychosis, and clinical high-risk groups, published between 2014 to 2016
   in four major psychiatric journals: American Journal of Psychiatry,
   Journal of the American Medical Association - Psychiatry, Schizophrenia
   Bulletin, and Schizophrenia Research.
   Results
   Of 474 US-based studies, 62\% (n = 295) reported analyses by race or
   ethnicity as compared to 20\% in Lewine and Caudle's (1999) study. The
   majority of papers (59\%) reported sample descriptions, a 42\% increase
   from Lewine and Caudle's (1999) study. Additionally, 47\% matched or
   compared the racial/ethnic composition of primary study groups and 12\%
   adjusted for race (e.g., as a covariate). However, only 9\% directly
   analyzed racial and/or ethnic identity in relation to the primary topic
   of the paper.
   Conclusions
   While schizophrenia studies report analyses by race and ethnicity more

Abstract = {{Climate change increases the odds of worsening drought and generating
   extreme weather events, being the poorest nations the most vulnerable.
   The emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) from anthropogenic activities
   have a considerable impact on climate change; in particular, the
   emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) has the weightiest
   and most aggressive impact on the Earth. An emergent solution is to
   convert those specific gases into syngas (CO + H-2) by using plasma
   technology; which offers reduced specific energy, and it is capable to
   produce very energetic species with instantaneous sequential chemical
   reactions.
   This work aims to validate the production of syngas comprising acetylene
   (C2H2) from the treatment of Biogas samples and a mixture composed of
   CH4, CO2, and N-2 using warm plasma reactors. Specific energy (SE) and
   Energy Conversion Efficiency (ECE) were obtained in the function of
   experimental settings, showing the potential of the warm plasma
   technology on GHG treatment.
   Additionally, a comparison between warm plasma and thermal cracking
   processes has shown that H-2 is generated more than 200 times faster and
   in a bigger quantity (more than 8 times) in a warm plasma than for
   conventional heating process. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Abstract = {{Type-2 diabetes (T2D) is a global disease caused by the inability of
   pancreatic beta-cells to secrete adequate insulin. However, the
   molecular mechanisms underlying the failure of beta-cells to respond to
   glucose in T2D remains unknown. Here, we investigated the relative
   contribution of UDP-glucose (UDP-G), a P2Y14-specific agonist, in the
   regulation of insulin release using human isolated pancreatic islets and
   INS-1 cells. P2Y14 was expressed in both human and rodent pancreatic
   beta-cells. Dose-dependent activation of P2Y14 by UDP-G suppressed
   glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and knockdown of P2Y14
   abolished the UDP-G effect. 12-h pretreatment of human islets with
   pertussis-toxin (PTX) improved GSIS and prevented the inhibitory effect
   of UDP-G on GSIS. UDP-G on GSIS suppression was associated with
   suppression of cAMP in INS-1 cells. UDP-G decreased the reductive
   capacity of nondiabetic human islets cultured at 5 mm glucose for 72 h
   and exacerbated the negative effect of 20 mm glucose on the cell
   viability during culture period. T2D donor islets displayed a lower
   reductive capacity when cultured at 5 mm glucose for 72 h that was
   further decreased in the presence of 20 mm glucose and UDP-G. Presence
   of a nonmetabolizable cAMP analog during culture period counteracted the
   effect of glucose and UDP-G. Islet cultures at 20 mm glucose increased
   apoptosis, which was further amplified when UDP-G was present. UDP-G
   modulated glucose-induced proliferation of INS-1 cells. The data provide
   intriguing evidence for P2Y14 and UDP-G's role in the regulation of
   pancreatic beta-cell function.}},

Abstract = {{Photocatalytic hydrogen generation from water or oxygenates is foreseen
   as a sustainable energy production route. In spite of recent performance
   achievements through Pt particle downsizing, knowledge of the
   prototypical Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst operation mechanism, in particular
   the electronic state and the stability of the Pt phase under reaction
   conditions, remains limited. We have investigated atomically dispersed
   Pt/TiO2 catalysts by pre-/postreaction scanning transmission electron
   microscopy and operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy-mass spectrometry
   under gas-phase ethanol dehydrogenation conditions under
   ultraviolet-visible light irradiation. The catalysts were prepared by a
   simple impregnation method on two types of commercial titania. While the
   general effect of the reaction on initially fully oxidized (Pt-IV)
   single-atom catalysts (SACs) is Pt reduction and aggregation, this
   combined phenomenon can be inhibited in two manners. First, when it is
   supported on high-surface-area anatase, the Pt SAC retains an
   intermediate oxidation state, and its clustering is limited to Pt dimers
   and trimers. Second, with the same support, a mild reducing pretreatment
   generates, through the formation of Pt-Ti bonds, near-neutral and
   ultradispersed Pt species (from single atoms to nanometric clusters)
   with the highest stability and activity in photocatalytic hydrogen
   evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Humans and non-humans can extract an estimate of the number of items in
   a collection very rapidly, raising the question of whether attention is
   necessary for this process. Visual attention operates in various modes,
   showing selectivity both to spatial location and to objects. Here, we
   tested whether each form of attention can enhance number estimation, by
   measuring whether presenting a visual cue to increase attentional
   engagement will lead to a more accurate and precise representation of
   number, both when attention is directed to location and when it is
   directed to objects. Results revealed that enumeration of a collection
   of dots in the location previously cued led to faster, more precise, and
   more accurate judgments than enumeration in un-cued locations, and a
   similar benefit was seen when the cue and collection appeared on the
   same object. This work shows that like many other perceptual tasks,
   numerical estimation may be enhanced by the spread of active attention
   inside a pre-cued object.}},

   compensation algorithm is designed in the controller side to reduce the
   effect of jamming attacks. Then, the model-free adaptive controller is
   designed such that the tracking error of the nonlinear system is
   stochastic stable, and all the analysis are based on input/output data.
   Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. (C)

Abstract = {{Background Diagnostic terms used in histopathology reports of cutaneous
   melanocytic lesions are not standardized. We describe
   dermatopathologists' views regarding diverse diagnostic terminology and
   the utility of the Melanocytic Pathology Assessment Tool and Hierarchy
   for Diagnosis (MPATH-Dx) for categorizing melanocytic lesions.
   Methods July 2018-2019 survey of board-certified and/or
   fellowship-trained dermatopathologists with experience interpreting
   melanocytic lesions.
   Results Among 160 participants, 99\% reported witnessing different
   terminology being used for the same melanocytic lesion. Most viewed
   diverse terminology as confusing to primary care physicians (98\%),
   frustrating to pathologists (83\%), requiring more of their time as a
   consultant (64\%), and providing necessary clinical information (52\%).
   Most perceived that adoption of the MPATH-Dx would: improve
   communication with other pathologists and treating physicians (87\%),
   generally be a change for the better (80\%), improve patient care
   (79\%), be acceptable to clinical colleagues (68\%), save time in
   pathology report documentation (53\%), and protect from malpractice
   (51\%).
   Conclusions Most dermatopathologists view diverse terminology as
   contributing to miscommunication with clinicians and patients, adversely
   impacting patient care. They view the MPATH-Dx as a promising tool to
   standardize terminology and improve communication. The MPATH-Dx may be a
   useful supplement to conventional pathology reports. Further revision
   and refinement are necessary for widespread clinical use.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) or anti-cyclic citrullinated
   peptide (anti-CCP) autoantibodies contributes to the current rheumatoid
   arthritis (RA) classification criteria. These criteria involve
   stratification on antibody levels, which limits reproducibility, and
   underperform in the RA patients without RF and anti-CCP. Here, we have
   explored if two anti-acetylated peptide antibodies (AAPA),
   anti-acetylated lysine (AcLys) and anti-acetylated ornithine (AcOrn),
   could improve the performance of the current criteria. The analysis was
   done in 1062 prospectively-followed early arthritis (EA) patients. The
   anti-AcOrn were more informative than the anti-AcLys, the conventional
   RA antibodies and the anti-carbamylated protein antibodies. The
   anti-AcOrn produced a classification that did not require antibody
   levels and showed improved specificity (77.6\% vs. 72.6\%, p=0.003) and
   accuracy (79.0\% vs. 75.8\%, p=0.002) over the current criteria. These
   improvements were obtained with a scoring system that values concordance
   between anti-AcOrn, RF and anti-CCP. No significant gain was obtained in
   sensitivity (80.2\% vs. 78.8\%, p=0.25) or in improving the
   classification of the RA patients lacking RF and anti-CCP, although the
   anti-AcOrn ranked first among the analysed new antibodies. Therefore,
   the anti-AcOrn antibodies could contribute to the improvement of RA
   classification criteria by exploiting antibody concordance.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic thermo-mechanical coupling behaviors of shape memory TiNi alloy
   in the strain rate ranging from 300 s(-1) to 2000 s(-1) are investigated
   by the split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) device with an infrared (IR)
   detection system. In stress-strain space, dynamic response shows a
   strong strain hardening property, however, in stress-temperature space,
   transformation path is particularly sensitive to the strain rate. The
   corresponding temperature evolution measured synchronously shows that
   local temperature increased associated with the forward phase
   transition, and it would keep the loading maximum value unchanged or
   decreased for unloading, depending on the strain rate. Besides, local
   temperature evolution was consistent with the transformation stress and
   its values at different points are the same. Temperature evolution and
   transformation deformation mechanism is then analyzed by a simple
   one-dimensional model. The results show that latent heat and dissipated
   energy are responsible for temperature variation. Furthermore, the
   temperature evolution with strain rate reveals that with the increase of
   strain rate, the phase transformation deformation mechanism undergoes a
   transformation from phase transition fronts propagation during lower
   strain rates to combination of local nucleation and front propagation
   during middle strain rate and to uniform nucleations during higher
   strain rates. The results are helpful for a passive shape memory alloy
   (SMA) micro-valve design.}},

Title = {{Is Interpersonal Guanxi Beneficial in Fostering Interfirm Trust? The
   Contingent Effect of Institutional- and Individual-Level Characteristics}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS}},
Abstract = {{Despite the prevalent role of guanxi in conducting business in Chinese,
   it is unclear whether interpersonal guanxi fosters interfirm trust.
   Taking a contingency approach, this study examines how institutional
   (government-market relationship and Buddhism influence) and individual
   (relative role performance and the span of partner control) factors
   moderate the association between interpersonal guanxi and interfirm
   trust. Based on a paired survey between salespersons and sales managers
   and two secondary datasets, this study finds that interpersonal guanxi
   is positively associated with interfirm trust. Moreover, this positive
   effect is stronger when firms operate in regions with strong
   government-market relationships and strong Buddhism influence. In
   addition, the positive relationship is weaker when guanxi resides in
   boundary spanners who have relatively high role performance, but becomes
   stronger when boundary spanners have a broad span of partner control.
   These findings highlight the situations in which guanxi at an
   interpersonal level is more or less likely to foster interfirm trust.}},

Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{Potassium-ion batteries or KIBs are prominent candidates among research
   involving post lithium-ion batteries due to abundant availability,
   low-cost, and low standard reduction potential of potassium metal.
   Although some chemistry correlation with other monovalent alkali
   metal-ion batteries may exist, research on KIB chemistry is still in its
   infancy. A relevant research aspect of KIB is the development of a
   stable anode material that can efficiently cycle the large K(+)ions in
   its crystal structure within the 0 to 3 V potential window range;
   providing reasonable charge capacity and high reversibility. To this
   end, transition metal dichalcogenides or TMDs are promising electrode
   materials because of their favorable electrochemical properties. In this
   work, we study electrochemical performance of tungsten ditelluride
   (WTe2) TMD as working electrode in a KIB half-cell. Results show that
   WTe2, a telluride-based TMD, has high first cycle specific charge
   capacity-with up to 3.3 K(+)stored per WTe(2)molecule (at least 4 times
   that of WS(2)electrode)-stable capacity of 143 mAh g(-1)at 10th cycle
   number-outperforming WS2(66 mAh g(-1)) and graphite (95 mAh g(-1))-good
   reversibility, reasonable cycling stability, and low charge transfer

Abstract = {{Background/Objective: Digital anthropometric (DA) assessments are
   increasingly being administered with three-dimensional (3D) optical
   devices in clinical settings that manage patients with obesity and
   related metabolic disorders. However, anatomic measurement sites are not
   standardized across manufacturers, precluding use of published reference
   values and pooling of data across research centers.
   Subjects/Methods: This study aimed to develop universal 3D analysis
   software by applying novel programming strategies capable of producing
   device-independent DA estimates that agree with conventional
   anthropometric (CA) measurements made at well-defined anatomic sites. A
   series of technical issues related to proprietary methods of 3D
   geometrical reconstruction and image analysis were addressed in
   developing major software components. To evaluate software accuracy,
   comparisons were made to CA circumference measurements made with a
   flexible tape at eleven standard anatomic sites in up to 35 adults
   scanned with three different commercial 3D optical devices.
   Results: Overall, group mean CA and DA values across the three systems
   were in good agreement, with similar to 2 cm systematic differences; CA
   and DA estimates were highly correlated (all p-values <0.01); root-mean
   square errors were low (0.51-3.27 cm); and CA-DA bias tended to be
   small, but significant depending on anatomic site and device.
   Conclusions: Availability of this software, with future refinements, has
   the potential to facilitate clinical applications and creation of large
   pooled uniform anthropometric databases.}},

Abstract = {{Recurrent loss-of-function mutations of BCL6 co-repressor (BCOR) gene
   are found in about 4\% of AML patients with normal karyotype and are
   associated with DNMT3a mutations and poor prognosis. Therefore, new
   anti-leukemia treatments and mouse models are needed for this
   combinatorial AML genotype. For this purpose, we first generated a
   Bcor(-/-) knockout mouse model characterized by impaired erythroid
   development (macrocytosis and anemia) and enhanced thrombopoiesis, which
   are both features of myelodysplasia/myeloproliferative neoplasms. We
   then created and characterized double Bcor(-/-)/Dnmt3a(-/-) knockout
   mice. Interestingly, these animals developed a fully penetrant acute
   erythroid leukemia (AEL) characterized by leukocytosis secondary to the
   expansion of blasts expressing c-Kit+ and the erythroid marker Ter119,
   macrocytic anemia and progressive reduction of the thrombocytosis
   associated with loss of Bcor alone. Transcriptomic analysis of double
   knockout bone marrow progenitors revealed that aberrant erythroid
   skewing was induced by epigenetic changes affecting specific
   transcriptional factors (GATA1-2) and cell-cycle regulators (Mdm2,
   Tp53). These findings prompted us to investigate the efficacy of
   demethylating agents in AEL, with significant impact on progressive
   leukemic burden and mice overall survival. Information gained from our
   model expands the knowledge on the biology of AEL and may help designing
   new rational treatments for patients suffering from this high-risk
   leukemia.}},

Abstract = {{Activated protein C is a trypsin-like protease with anticoagulant and
   cytoprotective properties that is generated by thrombin from the zymogen
   precursor protein C in a reaction greatly accelerated by the cofactor
   thrombomodulin. The molecular details of this activation remain elusive
   due to the lack of structural information. We now fill this gap by
   providing information on the overall structural organization of these
   proteins using single molecule FRET and small angle X-ray scattering.
   Under physiological conditions, both zymogen and protease adopt a
   conformation with all domains vertically aligned along an axis 76
   angstrom long and maximal particle size of 120 angstrom. This
   conformation is stabilized by binding of Ca2+ to the Gla domain and is
   affected minimally by interaction with thrombin. Hence, the zymogen
   protein C likely interacts with the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex
   through a rigid body association that produces a protease with
   essentially the same structural architecture. This scenario stands in
   contrast to an analogous reaction in the coagulation cascade where
   conversion of the zymogen prothrombin to the protease meizothrombin by
   the prothrombinase complex is linked to a large conformational
   transition of the entire protein. The presence of rigid epidermal growth
   factor domains in protein C as opposed to kringles in prothrombin likely
   accounts for the different conformational plasticity of the two
   zymogens. The new structural features reported here for protein C have
   general relevance to vitamin K-dependent clotting factors containing
   epidermal growth factor domains, such as factors VII, IX, and X.}},

Title = {{Foreign inflows and economic growth in Pakistan: some new insights}},

Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to explore the contending role of important
   external inflows on the economic growth of Pakistan economy. The main
   purpose behind focusing on Pakistan is that it is receiving significant
   inflows from different international sources such as International
   Monetary Fund, World Bank and Asian Development Bank.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The study adopted the autoregressive distributed lag cointegration
   approach for the purpose of exploring the long-run cointegrating
   relationship among the variables. As Pakistan Government had been
   implementing some major liberalization policies during 1990s, data from
   1976 to 2018 is used to estimate the specified models to reflect the
   impact of the surge of foreign inflows occurring from that time. In
   addition, error correction model is estimated for examining the
   short-run relationships.
   Findings
   The findings revealed the significant role played by different inflows
   in accelerating the economic growth. According to results, in the long
   run, all inflows, for example, Foreign direct investment (FDI), debt,
   official developdment assistance and remittances, have influenced
   significantly and positively the economic growth. The two control
   variables such as inflation and employment level included in the model
   have also played their expected role in the growth process. In the short
   run, some of the variables such as remittances, FDI and inflation rate
   have lost their significance level while for debt, aid and employment
   level, the signs of their coefficients become reversed.
   Practical implications
   Based on the findings, the study suggests the policymakers of Pakistan
   economy to liberalize the economy and attract more inflows from the
   external sources to accelerate economic growth.
   Originality/value
   To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first comprehensive
   empirical study on the role of foreign inflows in the process of
   economic growth in the context of Pakistan economy.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (RLH) of the liver is a rare liver lesion.
   It is considered difficult to differentiate radiologically from
   hepatocellular carcinoma, metastatic liver tumor and other pathologies.
   CASE SUMMARY
   A 54-year-old woman presented to our hospital with RLH of the liver. The
   patient had a diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma of the liver from an
   unknown origin and subsequently underwent partial hepatectomy. However,
   histopathological analysis revealed RLH. The lesion showed perinodular
   enhancement in the arterial phase on contrast-enhanced computed
   tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. On diffusion-weighted imaging
   (DWI), we encountered linear hyperintensity along the portal tract
   consecutive to the liver lesion, which is a new characteristic
   radiologic finding. This finding corresponded to the lymphoid cell
   infiltration of the portal tract. Furthermore, there was strongly
   restricted diffusion on the apparent diffusion coefficient map. We used
   these characteristic radiologic findings to diagnose the lesion as a
   lymphoproliferative disease.
   CONCLUSION
   The linear hyperintensity consecutive to the liver lesion on DWI
   provided additional valuable diagnostic information.}},

Abstract = {{We report the first statistical detection of X-ray emission from cosmic
   web filaments in ROSAT data. We selected 15 165 filaments at 0.2< z< 0.6
   ranging from 30 Mpc to 100 Mpc in length, identified in the Sloan
   Digital Sky Survey survey. We stacked the X-ray count-rate maps from
   ROSAT around the filaments, excluding resolved galaxy groups and
   clusters above the mass of similar to 3x10(13) M-circle dot as well as
   the detected X-ray point sources from the ROSAT, Chandra, and XMM-Newton
   observations. The stacked signal results in the detection of the X-ray
   emission from the cosmic filaments at a significance of 4.2 sigma in the
   energy band of 0.56-1.21 keV. The signal is interpreted, assuming the
   Astrophysical Plasma Emission Code model, as an emission from the hot
   gas in the filament-core regions with an average gas temperature of
   0.9(-0.6)(+1.0) keV and a gas overdensity of delta similar to 30 at the
   center of the filaments. Furthermore, we show that stacking the
   SRG/eROSITA data for similar to 2000 filaments only would lead to a
   greater than or similar to 5 sigma detection of their X-ray signal, even
   with an average gas temperature as low as similar to 0.3 keV.}},

Abstract = {{A novel colorimetric sheet based on Griess reagent-doped mesoporous
   silica nanoparticles was developed for nitrite detection. Griess reagent
   was adsorbed on long-range ordered hexagonal mesoporous silica
   nanoparticles and developed ink-bottle pores with some disorder. When
   the modified nanoparticles were bound using starch to fabricate a thin
   (similar to 313 mu m) colorimetric sheet, spherical particles with a
   rougher surface and some distortion of their mesoporosity were observed.
   The sheet was used in conjunction with digital image colorimetry (DIC)
   and provides a wide linear range of 0.05 to 2.50 mg L-1 with a low
   detection limit (15.0 mu g L-1-NO2-, equal to 4.5 mu g L-1 NO2--N), good
   inter-day precision (1.93\%RSD), and excellent precision (2.67\%
   relative error). The colorimetric sensors produced from the sheet costs
   only 0.04 USD each, while the DIC uses a standard smartphone for
   photographic detection. The method developed offers an easier and
   cheaper means of conducting rapid on-site determination of nitrite in
   water with reliable quantitative results.}},

   students}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AMERICAN COLLEGE HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   College students experience unprecedented levels of stress and anxiety,
   impacting their desire to perform well and live a balanced life.
   Mindfulness-based practices along with art therapy techniques have been
   demonstrated to improve psychological and physiological impacts of
   stress and anxiety among college students. Participants: 12
   undergraduate college students participated in pre and post-test
   interviews following their engagement in either mindfulness-based art
   therapy (MBAT) or a neutral clay task (NCT) using a 5-week online
   format. Methods: Descriptive phenomenology and artful inquiry were used
   to elicit participants' perspectives. Results: Both MBAT and NCT
   elicited relaxing and calming effects, but MBAT provided more proactive
   and direct benefits, with participants reporting that they could
   identify and move through stressors. While NCT participants described
   their experience as fun or playful. Conclusions: These findings offer
   notable support for implementing online and accessible mental health
   strategies such as MBAT and NCT into college settings.}},

Title = {{Detection and assignment of ozone bands near 95\% of the dissociation
   threshold: Ultrasensitive experiments for probing potential energy
   function and vibrational dynamics}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{102}},

Abstract = {{Ozone formation and depletion play a key role in various physical and
   chemical atmospheric processes which remain to be understood in more
   detail. The modeling of such phenomena based on ozone dynamics
   calculations requires a detailed knowledge of quantum states, transition
   probabilities, and ozone potential energy surface (PES) near the
   dissociation threshold D-0. Knowledge of highly excited rovibrational
   states with energies approaching D-0 is necessary for a reliable
   interpretation of satellite measurements of the ozone absorption or
   emission in the upper atmosphere in nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium
   conditions. In addition, these states provide an ideal probe of PESs
   computed by ab initio methods but their detection by absorption
   spectroscopy is particularly challenging due to the sharp decrease of
   the intensity with the energy of the corresponding vibrational
   combination and overtone bands. In this work, two very high-energy
   vibrational bands are detected by high sensitivity cavity ring-down
   spectroscopy providing a noise equivalent absorption alpha(min) on the
   order of a few 10(-11) cm(-1). The corresponding cold bands, assigned as
   nu(1) + 6 nu(2) + 3 nu(3) and 6 nu(1) + nu(2) + nu(3) centered at 7969
   and 7993 cm(-1) , respectively, are about nine orders of magnitude less
   intense than the well-known nu(3) fundamental band near 10 mu m. The
   spectrum analysis allowed for the experimental determination of 240
   rovibrational energy levels of the upper vibrational states. The
   corresponding rotational patterns, located between 93.1\% and 96.7\% of
   the dissociation threshold, are the most excited ones measured so far by
   absorption spectroscopy. The values of the band centers and rotational
   constants derived from the spectrum analysis provide further
   confirmation of the absence of an activation barrier on the
   minimum-energy path towards the dissociation threshold {[}Tyuterev et
   al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 143002 (2014)]. The vibrational dynamics is
   discussed in the context of the radiative transition probabilities and
   related Einstein coefficients for the observed bands. Another important
   question in the context of the nuclear dynamics concerns the interaction
   among the three identical potential wells of the ozone molecule in the
   ground electronic state, which appears to be due to the Jahn-Teller
   effect. Recent theoretical results accounting for the three potential
   wells in a full symmetry approach predicted that vibration states should
   exhibit deviations from the conventional one-potential-well ab initio
   calculations, near the dissociation threshold. In the present work, we
   observe a better agreement of the experimentally determined energy value
   with the three-wells prediction for the (1,6,3) vibrational state
   involving a large simultaneous excitation of both bending (nu(2) = 6)
   and asymmetric stretch (nu(3) = 3) vibrations pointing towards a nearby
   well. This could be tentatively interpreted as a manifestation of the
   three-wells effect.}},

Abstract = {{Cu clusters supported on CeO2 nanorods (NRs) were found to exhibit
   significantly enhanced activity and thermal/hydrothermal durability for
   low-temperature CO oxidation when the catalyst was calcined at 800
   degrees C in air prior to the catalytic measurements. The effect of
   calcination temperature and Cu loading on Cu-CeO2 catalysts was studied
   by the combination of powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Raman
   spectroscopy, H-2-temperature program reduction (H-2-TPR),
   ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS), synchrotron
   radiation photoelectron spectroscopy (SRPES), and X-ray absorption
   spectroscopy (XAS). Cu atoms were found to incorporate into the ceria
   lattice in air at below 500 degrees C, leading to the formation of a
   bulk CuyCe1-yO2-x solid solution. As the calcination temperature was
   raised to 800 degrees C, the solubility of Cu ions in bulk ceria was
   reduced sharply. Surface segregation of Cu atoms led to the formation of
   CuOx and a surface Cu-doped ceria thin layer, resulting in a much
   enhanced activity for CO oxidation. Moreover, the activities of calcined
   Cu-CeO2 catalysts did not increase with the Cu loading but exhibited an
   optimal activity at similar to 2 wt \% of Cu loading, where segregated
   CuOx species gave an average size in the sub-nanometer (sub-nm) range.
   Larger CuOx nanoparticles (NPs) on the Cu-doped ceria thin layer
   exhibited a lower activity toward CO oxidation. We believe the enhanced
   catalytic properties of the thermally aged Cu-CeO2 catalysts are
   attributed to the formation of an interface between sub-nm CuOx and the
   Cu-doped ceria thin layer. Our study thus sheds light on the nature of
   most active sites on Cu/CeO2 catalysts and facilitates the rational
   design of ceria-supported metal catalysts for oxidation reactions.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Holistic marine biodiversity conservation refers to ecosystem-based
   management through marine conservation planning (MCP), based on mapping
   habitat protection priority areas. In practice, MCP is frequently
   hindered by information gaps in biodiversity distributions, particularly
   on a marine ecoregion scale. Species distribution modelling (SDM) can
   help to resolve this gap and provide information essential for MCP
   scenarios. We constructed habitat configurations for three coastal
   marine megafauna animals using SDM, then based MCP scenarios on the
   projected habitat configurations and tested the use of marine megafauna
   animals as surrogates to protect major ecosystems.
   Location Gulf of Thailand, Southeast Asia.
   Methods A MaxEnt model was used to project likely habitats for
   Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis), Irrawaddy dolphins
   (Orcaella brevirostris) and sea turtles in the Gulf of Thailand. MARXAN
   software was used to prioritize spatial configurations for habitat
   protection. The percentage of overlaps between MARXAN delineations and
   major biodiversity features in the Gulf of Thailand were calculated.
   Results Habitat configurations of humpback dolphins, Irrawaddy dolphins
   and sea turtles were projected throughout the coastal and estuarine
   waters along the Gulf of Thailand. MCP based on the habitat of three
   marine megafauna animals highlighted five critical habitats for the
   protection of major ecosystems in the Gulf of Thailand.
   Main conclusions Holistic MCP starts with mapping critical habitats for
   marine protected area (MPA) networks, balances MPA networks with
   maritime livelihood activities and alleviates conflicts between MPA
   management and local livelihood needs. A combination of SDM and MARXAN
   methods provides a cost-effective approach to delineate MPA networks. In
   this approach, surrogate selection and data preparation should consider
   niches representative of regional ecosystem features and avoid spatial
   sampling bias. In coastal and estuarine waters, marine megafauna such as
   coastal cetaceans and sea turtles may serve as efficient surrogates to
   protect major ecosystems.}},

Title = {{An explorative study of beliefs in two groups of community health
   promoters of adolescent reproductive health in Indonesia: informed by
   theory of planned behavior}},
Journal = {{ETHNICITY \& HEALTH}},
Abstract = {{Objective
   To explore beliefs in specific social context and potential
   individual-level behavioral strategies used by two groups of community
   health promoters to foster their participation of promoting ARH.
   Design
   Two phases of formative studies based on the Theory of Planned Behavior
   (TPB) was conducted with community health promoters in the integrated
   service center (pos pelayanan terpadu/posyandu), posyandu cadres and
   peer educators of three villages in Tengger, East Java, Indonesia.
   Result
   The phase one, conducted with posyandu cadres (n = 20) and peer
   educators (n = 21). A survey using open-ended questions and focus group
   discussion was carry out to elicit accessible behavioral (advantages and
   disadvantages), normative (references of who have significant roles for
   promoters) and control (personal or situational factors) beliefs related
   to ARH promotion. The content analysis, elicited 15 salient beliefs for
   posyandu cadre and 21 for the peer educators. In phase two, the
   participants who previously participated in phase 1 (posyandu cadres (n
   = 14 and peer educators (n = 21))), completed two questionnaires to
   measure the belief strength and evaluation of the beliefs.
   Conclusions
   The result showed that each group has different characteristic in the
   strength of their beliefs in promoting reproductive health. The findings
   highlight the social context underlying beliefs associated with ARH
   promotion and opportunities to enhance engagement with the different
   groups of community health promoters.}},

Title = {{NMR spectroscopy analysis reveals differential metabolic responses in
   arabidopsis roots and leaves treated with a cytokinesis inhibitor}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{In plant cytokinesis, de novo formation of a cell plate evolving into
   the new cell wall partitions the cytoplasm of the dividing cell. In our
   earlier chemical genomics studies, we identified and characterized the
   small molecule endosidin-7, that specifically inhibits callose
   deposition at the cell plate, arresting late-stage cytokinesis in
   arabidopsis. Endosidin-7 has emerged as a very valuable tool for
   dissecting this essential plant process. To gain insights regarding its
   mode of action and the effects of cytokinesis inhibition on the overall
   plant response, we investigated the effect of endosidin-7 through a
   nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) metabolomics approach. In
   this case study, metabolomics profiles of arabidopsis leaf and root
   tissues were analyzed at different growth stages and endosidin-7
   exposure levels. The results show leaf and root-specific metabolic
   profile changes and the effects of endosidin-7 treatment on these
   metabolomes. Statistical analyses indicated that the effect of
   endosidin-7 treatment was more significant than the developmental
   impact. The endosidin-7 induced metabolic profiles suggest compensations
   for cytokinesis inhibition in central metabolism pathways. This study
   further shows that long-term treatment of endosidin-7 profoundly
   changes, likely via alteration of hormonal regulation, the primary
   metabolism of arabidopsis seedlings. Hormonal pathway-changes are likely
   reflecting the plant's responses, compensating for the arrested cell
   division, which in turn are leading to global metabolite modulation. The
   presented NMR spectral data are made available through the Metabolomics
   Workbench, providing a reference resource for the scientific community.}},

Abstract = {{The Ediacaran period (635-541Ma) was a time of major environmental
   change, accompanied by a transition from a microbial world to the animal
   world we know today. Multicellular, macroscopic organisms preserved as
   casts and molds in Ediacaran siliciclastic rocks are preserved worldwide
   and provide snapshots of early organismal, including animal, evolution.
   Remarkable evolutionary advances are also witnessed by diverse cellular
   and subcellular phosphatized microfossils described from the Doushantuo
   Formation in China, the only source showing a diversified assemblage of
   microfossils. Here, we greatly extend the known distribution of this
   Doushantuo-type biota in reporting an Ediacaran Lagerstatte from
   Laurentia (Portfjeld Formation, North Greenland), with phosphatized
   animal-like eggs, embryos, acritarchs, and cyanobacteria, the age of
   which is constrained by the Shuram-Wonoka anomaly (c. 570-560Ma). The
   discovery of these Ediacaran phosphatized microfossils from outside East
   Asia extends the distribution of the remarkable biota to a second
   palaeocontinent in the other hemisphere of the Ediacaran world,
   considerably expanding our understanding of the temporal and
   environmental distribution of organisms immediately prior to the
   Cambrian explosion. The Doushantuo biota of China is incredibly
   important for understanding the evolution of complex animals. Willman et
   al. report on evidence of Doushantuo-like biota from the Ediacaran of
   North Greenland, indicating that these important organisms were
   distributed across multiple palaeocontinents.}},

Abstract = {{Situated at the intersection of the literatures on soft power and

   It begins from the premise that there are multiple unexplored dimensions
   to the concept of soft power and proposes three advancements: the
   existence of multiple audiences for soft power narratives, the necessity
   of examining soft power aspirations in the context of hard power
   constraints, and the investigation of both of these dimensions with a
   view that acknowledges the role of time. Exploring both externally and
   internally targeted narratives, this paper demonstrates not only the
   attempts by Russian authorities to construct hegemonic ideology among
   the domestic population, but also reveals how the interplay of hard
   power and soft power concerns changed these narratives over time.}},

Abstract = {{The genes involved in the metabolic pathways of amyloid-beta (A beta)
   and tau proteins significantly influence the etiology of Alzheimer's
   disease (AD). Various studies have explored the associations between
   some of these genes and AD in the Caucasian population; however,
   researches regarding these associations remain limited in the Chinese
   population. To systematically evaluate the associations of these genes
   with AD, we investigated 19 genes involved in the metabolism of A beta
   and tau based on previous studies selected using the PubMed database.
   This study included 372 patients with sporadic late-onset AD (sLOAD) and
   345 cognitively healthy individuals from southern China. The results
   were replicated in the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project
   (IGAP). Protein-protein interactions were determined using the STRING
   v11 database. We found that a single-nucleotide polymorphism,
   rs11682128, of BIN1 conferred susceptibility to sLOAD after adjusting
   for age, sex, and APOE epsilon 4 status and performing the Bonferroni
   correction \{corrected P = 0.000153, odds ratio (OR) {[}95\% confidence
   interval (CI)] = 1.403 (1.079-1.824)\}, which was replicated in the
   IGAP. Protein-protein interactions indicated that BIN1 was correlated
   with MAPT. Moreover, rare variants of NEP and FERMT2 (0.0026 < corrected
   P < 0.05), and the A beta degradation, tau pathology, and tau
   phosphatase pathways (0.01 < corrected P < 0.05), were nominally
   significantly associated with sLOAD. This study suggested that the genes
   involved in the metabolic pathways of A beta and tau contributed to the
   etiology of sLOAD in the southern Han Chinese population.}},

Abstract = {{Stress-based topology optimization and nonlinear structural topology
   optimization is gaining increasing attention in order to make topology
   optimization more realistic. Thus, this paper extends current concepts
   of topology optimization to the design of structures made of nonlinear
   materials. An extended bi-directional evolutionary structural
   optimization (BESO) method for stress minimization topology optimization
   of material nonlinear structures is proposed in this work. BESO method
   based on discrete variables can effectively avoid the well-known
   singularity problem in density-based methods with low-density elements.
   The maximum von Mises stress is approximated by the p-norm global
   stress. The sensitivity information for designing variable updates is
   derived in detail by adjoint method. As for the highly nonlinear stress
   behavior, the updated scheme takes advantages from two filters
   respectively of the sensitivity and topological variables to improve
   convergence. Moreover, the filtered sensitivity numbers are combined
   with their historical sensitivity information to further stabilize the
   optimization process. The effectiveness of the proposed method is
   demonstrated by several 2D benchmark design problems.}},

Abstract = {{Nanocatalytic medicine has emerged as a promising method for the
   specific cancer therapy by mediating the interaction between tumor
   microenvironment biomarkers and nanoagents. However, the produced
   antitumor cell killing molecules, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS),
   by catalysis are insufficient to inhibit tumor growth. Herein, a novel
   kind of polyvinyl pyrrolidone modified multifunctional iron sulfide
   nanoparticles (Fe1-xS-PVP NPs) is developed via a one-step hydrothermal
   method, which exhibits high photothermal (PT) conversion efficiency (eta
   = 24\%) under the irradiation of 808 nm near-infrared laser. The
   increased temperature further facilitates the Fenton reaction to
   generate abundant center dot OH radicals. More importantly, under an
   acidic (pH = 6.5) condition within tumor environment, the Fe1-xS-PVP NPs
   can in situ produce H2S gas, which is evidenced to suppress the activity
   of enzyme cytochrome c oxidase (COX IV) in cancer cells, contributing to
   inhibit the growth of tumor. Both in vitro and in vivo results
   demonstrate that the H2S-mediated gas therapy in combination with PT
   enhanced ROS achieves excellent antitumor performance, which can open up
   a new approach for the design of gas-mediated cancer treatment.}},

Abstract = {{What is already known about this topic?
   Symptoms of malnutrition including anemia, stunting, wasting, and being
   underweight among children remained one of the major public health
   problems in poorer areas in China. More research is needed to guide
   interventions to improve nutrition and health among children in
   low-income regions.
   What is added by this report?
   The prevalences of anemia, stunting, wasting, and being underweight were
   51.9\%, 25.6\%, 14.6\%, and 9.5\%, respectively, among children aged 6
   to 24 months in the poorest areas of Liangshan. Associated factors were
   gender, age, education level and occupation of mother, breastfeeding,
   and caregiver knowledge.
   What are the implications for public health practice?
   Improving caregiver knowledge of nutrition and child feeding practices
   is crucial to address malnutrition among children. These findings can
   help more precisely understand the child health needs in poorer areas in
   order to develop effective interventions. They also provide
   evidence-based information to formulate child health promotion
   strategies in other countries with similar situations.}},

Abstract = {{Breakdown of gas insulated switchgears due to partial discharges (PD) is
   a major threat for the safe and reliable operation of power system
   network. In recent times, PD based diagnostics has been widely adopted
   by electrical utilities in order to evaluate the health of high voltage
   insulation system. However, very few reports are only available on the
   PD characteristics of gas insulated medium voltage (MV) circuit breaker
   prototypes, in particular with mixture of gases, over a wide range of
   pressure and voltage stress. Deep analysis of nature of PD signals in
   mixture of gas insulation and its time-frequency characteristics is
   important in order to develop efficient online condition monitoring
   systems for circuit breakers. This paper is aimed at the analysis of PD
   characteristics of a 22 kV MV circuit breaker prototype filled with
   SF6/N-2 gas mixtures using time-frequency (T-F) mapping and clustering
   technique. PD tests are carried out at different gas pressures (1-5 bar)
   and at different gas mixture ratios. Important PD parameters such as PD
   inception voltage, phase resolved PD (PRPD) pattern and PD repetition
   rate are evaluated. Clustering analysis of PD signals from the
   time-frequency mapping is carried out and formation of three different
   clusters consisting of short, long and repetitive PD pulses is
   identified. Online real time monitoring of individual cluster density
   will be helpful to understand the degradation of gas insulation of
   circuit breakers. Keeping in mind the minimal usage of SF6 gas, from the
   results, it is noted that 10\% SF6 gas can be mixed with 90\% N-2 at 3
   bar pressure to get satisfactory PD performance of a 22 kV medium
   voltage circuit breaker.}},

Abstract = {{Infrared lead chalcogenide quantum dots (QDs) suffer fast degradation
   due to the easy oxidation of surface chalcogen atoms. Here, we report a
   trioctylphosphine-mediated surface passivation method to improve the air
   stability of PbS QDs. Surface mechanism study reveals an in situ surface
   reaction, which leads to site-selective passivation of surface S atoms
   with lead mono-carboxylate. The surface capping motif sufficiently
   protects PbS QDs from oxygen and improves their stability as well as
   quantum efficiency regardless of the QD size and original ligands on
   surface cations. The modified PbS QDs display no obvious fluorescence
   quenching and surface oxidization after 30 days of air exposure. The
   robust surface capping also provides high compatibility of PbS QDs with
   polymers for optoelectronic device fabrication. The near-infrared LEDs
   based on the modified PbS QDs display a slight degradation of only
   1.47\% from the maximum intensity after continuous operation in air for
   250 hours (lifetime > 10,000 h) at 0.5 W/cm(2) power density, indicating
   the surface passivation route is promising strategy for promoting
   practical optoelectronic application of PbS QDs.}},

Abstract = {{The widespread existence of antibiotics has caused inevitable influence
   on ecology and humans. In this study, we screened the most commonly used
   antibiotics, and 64 antibiotics were detected in Shanghai, an
   international metropolis. Most of the target substances were detected in
   all 46 water samples including main rivers and districts in Shanghai,
   with concentrations ranging from 0.02 to 502.43 ng L-1. In particular,
   sulfadiazine (502.43 ng L-1) had the highest maximum concentration.
   Besides, risk quotients based on fish suggested that sulfonamides had a
   medium risk (0.12) in Shanghai. Correlation studies had shown that most
   compounds with frequencies exceeding 60\% were significantly positively
   correlated with the total concentration. Based on further analysis,
   sulfadiazine, sulfamerazine, and sulfapyridine were screened as
   indicators to reflect the pollution status of antibiotics in Shanghai
   for a long time. The screening conditions for these indicators include
   detection rate (> 60\%), maximum concentration (> 100 ng L-1), RQ (>
   0.01), and correlation (> 0). In addition, population density may be the
   main factor for antibiotic pollution through regional comparison. In a
   word, this work can systematically reflect the overall situation of
   Shanghai antibiotics and provide support for global data comparison in
   the future. Meanwhile, we provided the potential indicators that can be
   applied in the long term and economical monitoring of antibiotics.}},

   thermo-hydraulic performance of shell-and-tube heat exchanger}},
Journal = {{APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{180}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{This study presents the development and evaluation of a novel
   shell-and-tube heat exchanger (STHX) design with segmental porous
   baffles. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in combination with machine
   learning tools are utilized to investigate the thermo-hydraulic impacts
   of segmental porous baffles on shell side flow of a STHX. Three
   geometric parameters (number of baffles, baffle angle, and baffle
   thickness) of these baffles, which are placed inside the STHX, are
   selected to perform the parametric study and multi-objective
   optimization. Higher number of baffles are beneficial to increase the
   rate of heat exchange; however, it would escalate the pressure drop
   considerably. Results also show that baffles angle plays a critical role
   on the performance of a STHX. An artificial neural network (ANN) is
   trained to predict the system's performance. As lowering the pressure
   drop and increasing the heat transfer are the two main objectives in
   STHX, a multi-objective optimization study is conducted. Different
   decision-making algorithms are also applied to find the best alternative
   among the Pareto frontier points. Results of optimization show that a
   STHX with 10 porous baffles, baffle angle of 111.9, and baffle thickness
   of 16.69 mm would be the best geometrical configuration which results in
   a heat transfer rate of 523.81 kW while the pressure drop of the shell
   side flow would be 48.87 kPa. With this novel design, it is also
   possible to improve both pressure drop and heat transfer rate of STHX,
   simultaneously. A particular configuration of the introduced STHX could
   reduce the pressure drop by 61.3\% while heat transfer enhances by
   11.15\% simultaneously.}},

   to evaluate the potential association of TLR2-3-4 and 7 gene
   polymorphisms with Tunisian PF. Fourteen polymorphisms were analyzed in
   93 Tunisian PF patients compared to 193 matched healthy controls:
   rs5743703-rs5743709 and (GT)(n) repeat (TLR2); rs5743305, rs3775294, and
   rs3775291 (TLR3), rs4986790 and rs4986791 (TLR4); and rs3853839 (TLR7).
   Our results showed that the genetic factors varied depending on the
   epidemiological feature stratification. In fact, in the whole
   population, no association with the susceptibility to PF was found. The
   TLR2 GT repeat seems to be closely associated with PF risk in patients
   originated from the endemic localities (group 3); the GT(18) allele and
   the heterozygous genotype GT(18)/GT(19) seem to confer risk to endemic
   PF (P=0.02; OR=2.3 {[}1.1-4.9] and P=0.0002, OR=20 {[}2.5-171],
   respectively). In contrast, the GT(23) repeat could be considered as
   protector allele (P=0.02, OR=0.2 {[}0.06-0.87]). Furthermore, medium GT
   alleles which induce high promoter activity were also significantly more
   frequent in patients versus short or long GT repeats (P=0.0018 with
   OR=3.26 {[}1.5-7]). On the other hand, the TLR3-rs574305 AA genotype and
   A allele were significantly more frequent in patients whose age of the
   onset was above 35 years (group 2) (P=0.038, OR=1.78 and P=0.009,
   OR=3.92, respectively). Besides, the TLR4>rs3775294 A allele was found
   to be protector only in patients with sporadic features (groups 2 and 4)
   (P=0.03, OR=0.57 {[}0.3-0.9] and P=0.006, OR=0.24 {[}0.08-0.74],
   respectively). No statistically significant difference was observed in
   the genotypic and allelic frequencies of TLR-4 and TLR-7 gene
   polymorphisms. The present data suggest that TLR2and TLR3 polymorphisms
   are significantly associated with increased susceptibility to PF in the
   Tunisian population.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) and 3D through-space C-13-C-13 homonuclear
   spin-diffusion techniques are powerful solid-state nuclear magnetic
   resonance (NMR) tools for extracting structural information from
   C-13-enriched biomolecules, but necessarily long acquisition times
   restrict their applications. In this work, we explore the broad utility
   and underutilized power of a chemical shift-selective one-dimensional
   (1D) version of a 2D C-13-C-13 spin-diffusion solid-state NMR technique.
   The method, which is called 1D dipolar-assisted rotational resonance
   (DARR) difference, is applied to a variety of biomaterials including
   lignocellulosic plant cell walls, microcrystalline peptide fMLF, and
   black widow dragline spider silk. 1D C-13-C-13 spin-diffusion methods
   described here apply in select cases in which the 1D C-13 solid-state
   NMR spectrum displays chemical shift-resolved moieties. This is
   analogous to the selective 1D nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy
   (NOESY) experiment utilized in liquid-state NMR as a faster (1D instead
   of 2D) and often less ambiguous (direct sampling of the time domain
   data, coupled with increased signal averaging) alternative to 2D NOESY.
   Selective 1D C-13-C-13 spin-diffusion methods are more time-efficient
   than their 2D counterparts such as proton-driven spin diffusion (PDSD)
   and dipolar-assisted rotational resonance. The additional time gained
   enables measurements of C-13-C-13 spin-diffusion buildup curves and
   extraction of spin-diffusion time constants T-SD, yielding detailed
   structural information. Specifically, selective 1D DARR difference
   buildup curves applied to C-13-enriched hybrid poplar woody stems
   confirm strong spatial interaction between lignin and acetylated xylan
   polymers within poplar plant secondary cell walls, and an interpolymer
   distance of similar to 0.45-0.5 nm was estimated. Additionally, Tyr/Gly
   long-range correlations were observed on isotopically enriched black
   widow spider dragline silks.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to reexamine long-run and causal effects of trade
   openness, energy usage, gross capital formation, and real growth on CO2
   emissions in Mexico utilizing recent econometric techniques. The study
   utilizes yearly data spanning between 1971 and 2016. No prior study has
   used the wavelet coherence approach to collect information on the
   correlation and/or causal relation between these economic variables at
   different frequencies and time frames. Th us, this study proposes to
   fill the gap in the literature. The motives of the study are to address
   the questions: (a) Is the EKC hypothesis valid for Mexico? (b) Is there
   a long-run and causal relationship between CO(2 )emissions and its
   determinants? (c) How are the indicators related at different
   frequencies and various periods? To capture long-run effects, the study
   utilized ARDL, FMOLS, and DOLS estimators, while wavelet coherence
   technique is utilized to explore causal effects among the variables. The
   empirical findings confirm that (a) EKC hypothesis is valid for Mexico;
   and (b) gross capital formation, energy usage, and economic growth
   impact CO2 emissions positively. The wavelet coherence technique
   revealed (a) bidirectional causality between economic growth and CO2
   emissions; (b) unidirectional causality from CO2 emissions to energy
   usage; and (c) one-way causality running from CO2 emissions to gross
   capital formation. Based on these findings, recommendations were
   suggested.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Abstract = {{Riboflavin is commonly taken as a nutritional supplement, and it
   converts to coenzymes during the process of energy production from
   carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Although riboflavin is considered to
   be an anti-inflammatory vitamin because of its antioxidant properties,
   the effects of riboflavin on inflammasome have been not reported.
   Inflammasome, a cytosolic surveillance protein complex, leads to the
   activation of caspase-1, cytokine maturation, and pyroptosis. In the
   present study, riboflavin attenuated the indicators of NLRP3
   inflammasome activation in macrophages, such as the maturation and
   secretion of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-18, and caspase-1; the
   formation of Asc pyroptosome; and the cleavage of gasdermin D. In
   addition, the oral and peritoneal administration of riboflavin inhibited
   the peritoneal production of IL-1 beta and IL-18 in a mouse model.
   Mechanistically, riboflavin prevented mitochondrial perturbations, such
   as mitochondrial ROS production and mitochondrial DNA release, which
   trigger the NLRP3 inflammasome assembly. Riboflavin was further
   confirmed to disrupt the activity of caspase-1, and it also inhibited
   the AIM2, NLRC4, and non-canonical inflammasomes. Therefore, riboflavin
   has both an antioxidant effect and an anti-inflammasome property that
   regulates the inflammatory response.}},

Abstract = {{The Fe sublattice in the compound ZrFe4Si2 features geometrical
   frustration and quasi-one-dimensionality. We therefore investigated the
   magnetic behavior in ZrFe4Si2 and its evolution upon substituting Ge for
   Si and under the application of hydrostatic pressure using structural,
   magnetic, thermodynamic, and electrical-transport probes. Magnetic
   measurements reveal that ZrFe4Si2 holds paramagnetic Fe moments with an
   effective moment mu(eff) = 2.18 mu(B). At low temperatures the compound
   shows a weak short-range magnetic order below 6 K. Our studies
   demonstrate that substituting Ge for Si increases the unit-cell volume
   and stabilizes the short-range order into a long-range spin-density wave
   type magnetic order. On the other hand, hydrostatic pressure studies
   using electrical-resistivity measurements on ZrFe4(Si0.88Ge0.12)(2)
   indicate a continuous suppression of the magnetic ordering upon
   increasing pressure. Therefore, our combined chemical substitution and
   hydrostatic pressure studies suggest the existence of a
   lattice-volume-controlled quantum critical point in ZrFe4Si2.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time detection of humans is an evolutionary research topic. It is
   an essential and prominent component of various vision based
   applications. Detection of humans in real-time video sequences is an
   arduous and challenging task due to various constraints like cluttered
   environment, occlusion, noise, etc. Many researchers are doing their
   research in this area and have published the number of researches so
   far. Determining humans in visual monitoring system is prominent for
   different types of applications like person detection and
   identification, fall detection for an elder person, abnormal
   surveillance, gender classification, crowd analysis, person gait
   characterization, etc. The main objective of this paper is to provide a
   comprehensive survey of the various challenges and modern developments
   seen for human detection methodologies in day vision. This paper
   consists of an overview of different human detection techniques and
   their classification based on various underlying factors. The
   algorithmic technicalities with their applicability to these techniques
   are deliberated in detail in the manuscript. Different humanitarian
   imperative factors have also been highlighted for comparative analysis
   of each human detection methodology. Our survey shows the difference
   between current research and future requirements.}},

Abstract = {{A new and simple photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensor using a glassy carbon
   electrode (GCE) modified with bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) nanoparticles and

   0.099 to 0.99 mu mol L-1 and limits of detection and quantification of
   0.027 and 0.091 mu mol L-1, respectively, was obtained. The proposed

   construction was easy and had a short response time, which might confer
   higher sample throughput for the method.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND ERGONOMICS}},
Abstract = {{Whole-body vibration (WBV) is one of the leading risk factors for
   development of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) that develop symptoms of
   lower back pain, pain in the neck and shoulders, digestive problems,
   blood pressure and diabetes among professional dumper operators. The
   present study specifically aimed at assessing the WBV exposure of 79
   dumper operators engaged in two Indian opencast coal mines through
   vibration measurements followed by questionnaire survey. From the daily
   frequency-weighted root mean square exposure, dumper operators have
   experienced vibration levels higher than the Health Guidance Caution
   Zone (HGCZ) of Standard No. ISO 2631-1:1997. However, on the basis of
   daily vibration dose values, 60.8\% of operators have experienced
   vibration levels above the HGCZ. Finally, an attempt was also made to
   explore the potential of a Bayesian network to predict the risk factors
   for WBV of dumper operators in development of MSDs to prioritize the
   factors for human health risk assessment.}},

Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Microwave (MW) assisted chloride leaching was studied to remove valuable
   and heavy metals from two zinc plant residues, i.e. goethite sludge and
   Zn-leach product.
   For both materials, NaCl leaching parameters, such as temperature, NaCl
   concentration, leaching time and addition of acid, were optimized. For
   goethite sludge, the best efficiencies for Cu (45-47 \%), Pb (83-90 \%),
   and Zn (47-58 \%) extraction, with a minimal dissolution of matrix
   elements, were obtained at 200 degrees C, 300 g/L NaCl and L/S 10. At
   short leaching times (5 min) the maximal leachability of Cu and Zn was
   reached, while at longer leaching time (60 min) the Pb extraction
   increased to 90 +/- 1\%. Zn leaching was limited due to the presence of
   stable franklinite (ZnFe2O4).
   NaCl (280 g/L) leaching of Zn-leach product required the addition of 1 M
   HCl to improve metal leaching to Ag 52 +/- 3 \%, Bi 83 +/- 1 \%, Cd 82
   +/- 4 \%, Sb 39 +/- 1 \%, Zn 71 +/- 2 \% at 200 degrees C, L/S 10 for 30
   min. Consequently, matrix dissolution was enhanced. Metal associations
   in Zn-leach product were statistically investigated. The environmental
   impact of the MW leached materials was evaluated by a one stage leaching
   test, which showed a significant overall reduction in heavy metal
   leachability compared to untreated materials.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN POLYMER JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{140}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Fabrication and optimization of conductive scaffolds capable of inducing
   proper intercellular connections through electrical signals is critical
   for neural tissue engineering. In this research, electrospun conductive
   PVA (Polyvinyl alcohol)/PEDOT(poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene))
   scaffolds were fabricated in different compositions. Conductivity of
   electrospinning solutions and electrospun scaffolds were measured.
   Morphology and topography, mechanical properties and water contact angle
   of scaffolds were analyzed. Chemistry of scaffolds were studied using
   FTIR analysis, while biocompatibility and cellular interactions with
   scaffolds were tested using MTT assay and cellular attachment and
   spreading testing. Our results show improvements in PEDOT-containing
   scaffolds, in terms of physiochemical properties, and cell viability
   compared to pure PVA scaffolds. After optimization of scaffolds,
   real-time PCR analysis was used to study neural differentiation of rat
   mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Scaffold samples with and without
   induction of electrical stimulation are shown to upregulate
   beta-tubulin, nestin and enolase as compared to TCP samples.
   Additionally, expression of nestin gene in scaffold samples with
   electrical stimulation was 1.5 times more significant than scaffold
   sample. Overall, this study shows that using PVA/PEDOT conductive
   scaffolds with electrical stimulation can improve cellular response and
   neural differentiation through mimicking the properties of native neural
   tissue.}},

Abstract = {{Frames are indispensable tools for journalists to make sense of
   unfolding events, but they also constrain their perspective to most
   readily see what they expect to see. In this study, we examine how
   pre-established news frames continue to inform journalists' framing
   practices despite the ongoing arrival of novel, often contravening
   information. Specifically, we argue that dominant frames rooted in
   pre-existing cultural perceptions and strategic elite frame building
   have the capacity to overpower an open-minded appraisal of available
   information. In a qualitative, diachronic analysis of US, British and
   Russian news coverage of the 2013 Syrian Chemical Weapons crisis, we
   analyze journalists' strategies for negotiating between pre-established
   news frames and novel, discrepant claims and observations. We find that
   most claims that directly contravened existing frames were either
   ignored or discounted by questioning the credibility of sources. By
   contrast, unforeseen events effectively challenged the predictive
   validity of dominant frames, necessitating adaptations with often
   far-reaching consequences for the frame. Observed patterns were
   consistent across outlets, despite the different journalistic cultures
   and embedding media systems and political settings. Our findings
   illuminate the important role of journalists' pre-established ideas,
   which shape their news selection and framing practices, contributing to
   the maintenance of existing news narratives.}},

Abstract = {{Prenatal care, understood as routine care provided during pregnancy,
   should be based on basic pillars, such as taking into account the
   sociocultural context in which such care is offered, ensuring that the
   service is appropriate, accessible and of high quality, and also with
   care personalized. According to World Health Organization, the minimum
   number of recommended visits during pregnancy should be eight, with the
   different professionals involved in the process, in addition to
   preparing for childbirth or maternal education.
   Since the pandemic erupted due to SARS-CoV-2, many of the usual social
   health services have had to adapt to provide safety and prevent
   infection, a priority in vulnerable groups where pregnant women are
   found. Professionals have had to adapt to telematics care, thus
   attending consultations to reduce the mobility of pregnant women to
   health centers, thus avoiding unnecessary risks. Therefore, all this
   situation has opened a virtual field of work that, although previously
   carried out in different areas, now more than ever acquires special
   relevance and for which professional training is necessary, as a

Abstract = {{This paper introduces voxelized atomic structure (VASt) potentials as a
   machine learning (ML) framework for developing interatomic potentials.
   The VASt framework utilizes a voxelized representation of the atomic
   structure directly as the input to a convolutional neural network (CNN).
   This allows for high-fidelity representations of highly complex and
   diverse spatial arrangements of the atomic environments of interest. The
   CNN implicitly establishes the low-dimensional features needed to
   correlate each atomic neighborhood to its net atomic force. The
   selection of the salient features of the atomic structure (i.e., feature
   engineering) in the VASt framework is implicit, comprehensive,
   automated, scalable, and highly efficient. The calibrated convolutional
   layers learn the complex spatial relationships and multibody
   interactions that govern the physics of atomic systems with remarkable
   fidelity. We show that VASt potentials predict highly accurate forces on
   two phases of silicon carbide and the thermal conductivity of silicon
   over a range of isotropic strain.}},

Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce a complete family of parametrized
   quasi-probability distributions in phase space and their corresponding
   Weyl quantization maps with the aim to generalize the recently developed
   Wigner-Weyl formalism within the loop quantum cosmology (LQC) program.
   In particular, we intend to define those quasi-distributions for states
   valued on the Bohr compactification of the real line in such a way that
   they are labeled by a parameter that accounts for the ordering ambiguity
   corresponding to non-commutative quantum operators. Hence, we notice
   that the projections of the parametrized quasi-probability distributions
   result in marginal probability densities which are invariant under any
   ordering prescription. We also note that, in opposition to the standard
   Schrodinger representation, for an arbitrary character the
   quasi-distributions determine a positive function independently of the
   ordering. Further, by judiciously implementing a parametric-ordered Weyl
   quantization map for LQC, we are able to recover in a simple manner the
   relevant cases of the standard, anti-standard, and Weyl symmetric
   orderings, respectively. We expect that our results may serve to analyze
   several fundamental aspects within the LQC program, in special those
   related to coherence, squeezed states, and the convergence of operators,
   as extensively analyzed in the quantum optics and in the quantum
   information frameworks.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effects of plasticity on the effective
   fracture toughness. A layered material is considered as a modelling
   system. An elastic-plastic phase-field model and a surfing boundary
   condition are used to study how the crack propagates throughout the
   material and the evolution of the effective toughness as a function of
   the layer angle. We study three idealized situations where only one of
   the properties among fracture toughness, Young's modulus and yield
   strength is taken to be heterogeneous and the others are assumed to be
   uniform. We observe that in the case of toughness and strength
   heterogeneity, the material exhibits anomalous isotropy: the effective
   toughness is equal to the largest of the point-wise values for any layer
   angle except when the layers are parallel to the macroscopic direction
   of propagation. As the layer angle decreases, the crack propagates along
   the brittle-to-tough interfaces, whereas it goes straight when the
   layers have different yield strength but uniform toughness. We find that
   smooth deflections in the crack path do not induce any overall
   toughening and that the effective toughness is not proportional to
   either the cumulated fracture energy or the cumulated plastic work. In
   the case of elastic heterogeneity, the material is anisotropic in the
   sense of the effective toughness, as the latter varies as a function of
   the layer angle. Four toughening mechanisms are active: stress
   fluctuations, crack renucleation, plastic dissipation and plastic
   blunting. Finally, we consider a layered medium comprised of
   compliant-tough-weak and stiff-brittle-strong phases, as it is the case
   for many structural composites. We observe a transition from an
   interface-dominated to a plasticity-dominated failure regime, as the
   phase constituents become more ductile. The material is anisotropic in
   the sense of the effective toughness.}},

Abstract = {{Macroalgae live in tight association with bacterial communities, which
   impact most aspects of their biology. Clean, ideally axenic, algal
   starting material is required to control and study these interactions.
   Antibiotics are routinely used to generate clean tissue; however,
   bacterial resistance to antibiotics is increasingly widespread and
   sometimes related to the emergence of potentially pathogenic,
   multi-resistant strains. In this study, we explore the suitability of
   two alternative treatments for use with algal cultures: essential oils
   (EOs; thyme, oregano and eucalyptus) and povidone-iodine. The impact of
   these treatments on bacterial communities was assessed by bacterial cell
   counts, inhibition diameter experiments and 16S-metabarcoding. Our data
   show that thyme and oregano essential oils (50\% solution in DMSO, 15 h
   incubation) efficiently reduced the bacterial load of algae without
   introducing compositional biases, but they did not eliminate all
   bacteria. Povidone-iodine (2\% and 5\% solution in artificial seawater,
   10 min incubation) both reduced and changed the alga-associated
   bacterial community, similar to the antibiotic treatment. The proposed
   EO- and povidone-iodine protocols are thus promising alternatives when
   only a reduction of bacterial abundance is necessary and where the
   phenomena of antibiotic resistance are likely to arise.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Infected ureteral stones are a urologic emergency and
   require urgent decompression. We set out to determine whether serum
   procalcitonin (PCT) could aid in the diagnosis of infected ureteral
   stones.
   Methods: All consecutive patients presenting to the emergency room from
   November 9, 2016, to November 10, 2018, with an obstructing ureteral
   stone were included. All patients had complete blood count, urinalysis
   (UA), PCT, and urine culture (UCx). Subgroup analysis was performed in a
   ``clinically equivocal{''} cohort of afebrile patients defined as a
   leukocytosis >10(4)/mu L and UA with <50 white blood cells (WBCs) per
   high powered field (hpf). Patients with positive and negative UCx were
   compared.
   Results: A total of 231 patients were included, of whom 56 had a
   positive UCx. Of all covariates, UA WBCs with a cutoff of 9 per hpf
   performed best at predicting positive UCx with an area under the curve
   (AUC) of 0.87. PCT did not perform as well with an ideal cutoff of 0.08
   ng/mL, having an AUC of 0.77, sensitivity 70.6\%, specificity 73.9\%,
   positive predictive value (PPV) 34.3\%, and negative predictive value
   (NPV) 92.9\%. When looking at the clinically equivocal cohort, UA WBCs
   with a cutoff of 6 per hpf appeared to perform best at predicting a
   positive UCx with an AUC of 0.72. PCT was less predictive in this cohort
   with an ideal cutoff of 0.3 ng/mL, having an AUC of 0.32, sensitivity
   47.1\%, specificity 85.2\%, PPV 38.1\%, and NPV 89.3\%.
   Conclusion: PCT does not appear to be a superior marker for diagnosing
   urinary tract infection in the setting of obstructing ureterolithiasis
   when compared with components of the standard work-up.}},

Title = {{A machine learning approach to predict pancreatic islet grafts rejection
   versus tolerance}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{The application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning
   (ML) in biomedical research promises to unlock new information from the
   vast amounts of data being generated through the delivery of healthcare
   and the expanding high-throughput research applications. Such
   information can aid medical diagnoses and reveal various unique patterns
   of biochemical and immune features that can serve as early disease
   biomarkers. In this report, we demonstrate the feasibility of using an
   AI/ML approach in a relatively small dataset to discriminate among three
   categories of samples obtained from mice that either rejected or
   tolerated their pancreatic islet allografts following transplant in the
   anterior chamber of the eye, and from naive controls. We created a
   locked software based on a support vector machine (SVM) technique for
   pattern recognition in electropherograms (EPGs) generated by micellar
   electrokinetic chromatography and laser induced fluorescence detection
   (MEKC-LIFD). Predictions were made based only on the aligned EPGs
   obtained in microliter-size aqueous humor samples representative of the
   immediate local microenvironment of the islet allografts. The analysis
   identified discriminative peaks in the EPGs of the three sample
   categories. Our classifier software was tested with targeted and
   untargeted peaks. Working with the patterns of untargeted peaks (i.e.,
   based on the whole pattern of EPGs), it was able to achieve a 21 out of
   22 positive classification score with a corresponding 95.45\% prediction
   accuracy among the three sample categories, and 100\% accuracy between
   the rejecting and tolerant recipients. These findings demonstrate the
   feasibility of AI/ML approaches to classify small numbers of samples and
   they warrant further studies to identify the analytes/biochemicals
   corresponding to discriminative features as potential biomarkers of
   islet allograft immune rejection and tolerance.}},

Abstract = {{Paradoxically, a very broad diffraction background, named the
   bell-shaped-component (BSC), has been established as a feature of
   graphene growth. Recent diffraction studies as a function of electron
   energy have shown that the BSC is not related to scattering
   interference. Here, additional experiments are carried out as a function
   of temperature over the range in which single-layer graphene (SLG)
   grows. Quantitative fitting of the profiles shows that the BSC follows
   the increase of the Gr(10) spot, proving directly that the BSC indicates
   high-quality graphene. Additional metal deposition experiments provide
   more information about the BSC. The BSC is insensitive to metal
   deposition, and it increases with metal intercalation, because a more
   uniform interface forms between graphene and SiC. These experiments
   support the conclusion that the BSC originates from electron confinement
   within SLG, and surprisingly, it is an excellent measure of graphene
   uniformity.}},

Abstract = {{Camera pose estimation is key to the proper functioning of robotic
   systems, supporting critical tasks such as robot navigation, target
   tracking, camera calibration, etc. While multiple algorithms solving
   this problem have been proposed, their correctness has rarely been
   validated using formal techniques. This is true despite the fact that
   the adoption of formal verification is essential for the reliability of
   safety-critical systems, and for their certification to high assurance
   levels. In this article, we present an effort in formally verifying an
   algorithm for camera pose estimation in an interactive theorem prover.
   The algorithm leverages the power of Rodrigues formula to solve the pose
   estimation problem under conditions for which existing solutions cannot
   be applied. The technical ingredients include (but are not limited to)
   mechanized proofs of the Rodrigues formula (along with its Cayley
   decomposition form) and the least squares method for fitting data. Based
   on the formalization of the algorithm, we formally derive and verify its
   general solution and unique solution.}},

Abstract = {{A novel erbium-mercury complex {[}Er(HIA)(3)(H2O)(2)](n) {[}0.5n
   (2,6-NA)](nHgBr(4)) (denoted as compound 1, HIA = isonicotinic acid;
   2,6-NA = 2,6-Naphthalenedisulfonic acid) has been synthesized via a
   hydrothermal reaction and characterized by single crystal X-ray
   diffraction technique. Compound 1 features a one-dimensional (1-D)
   chain-like structure. A solid state photoluminescence measurement
   revealed that there are two upconversion emission peaks at 487 nm and
   529 nm, of which the latter is stronger. These peaks can be assigned to
   the characteristic emission of 4f electron intrashell transitions of
   Er3+ ions F-4(7/2) -> I-4(15/2) and H-2(11/2) -> I-4(15/2). A energy
   transfer mechanism of photoluminescence emission was described using an
   energy state diagram of Er3+ ions and isonicotinic acid ligand. Compound
   1 shows CIE chromaticity coordinates in the green region (0.1559,
   0.5611). Compound 1 has a wide band gap of 2.05 eV, which was revealed
   by a solid-state UV/Vis diffuse reflection experiment. (C) 2020 Elsevier

   4H(2)O (phen=1,10-phenanthroline, C12N2H8) (1), is synthesized and
   utilized for photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes and antibiotic
   in a wide range of pH. The experimental results show that 1 acting as
   the Fenton-like catalyst with H2O2 exhibits remarkable activity at pH
   3-9 under vis-light irradiation and is merited with excellent
   recyclability and reusability. A variety of analytical methods,
   including in-situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and
   density functional theory (DFT) calculations, are applied to study the
   mechanism on generation of center dot OH and O-2(center dot-) radicals
   for photocatalytic degradation. It suggests that, unlike the classical
   Fenton process involving the redox transformation of the central
   cations, the generation of center dot OH and O-2(center dot-) radicals
   is associated with the substitution of the coordinating water molecules
   at Co(II) by H2O2 and/or OEH-, followed by the light-driven O-O bond
   cleavage and dissociation The outcomes of this study are striking which
   overcome the obstacles in the classical Fe-II-Fenton process, including
   the slow redox transformation between Fe(II) and Fe(III) and the
   production of massive iron precipitates especially at elevated pH It
   opens up new avenues for the development of the high-performance
   Fenton(-like) catalysts for photocatalytic degradation over extended pH
   and provides new insight into the related process.}},

Title = {{Patterns of Necrophilic Behaviors in Sexual Homicide: A Criminological
   Perspective}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OFFENDER THERAPY AND COMPARATIVE CRIMINOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{This study aims to empirically explore the patterns of necrophilic
   behaviors in sexual homicide. More specifically, the study investigates
   offender, victim, and crime characteristics of sexual homicides where
   necrophilic acts were perpetrated, to determine whether the primary
   motivation to kill is associated with the attainment of corpses or
   whether the post-mortem sexual acts were secondary deviant behaviors.
   The sample used in this study consists of 109 cases of extrafamilial
   sexual homicides where post-mortem sexual acts were committed by
   offenders. Latent class analysis was used to examine each step of the
   crime-commission process of sexual homicide offenders involved in
   necrophilic behaviors. Our findings suggest that there are four
   different patterns of necrophilia in sexual homicide: Opportunistic,
   experimental, preferential, and sadistic. Preferential offenders are the
   only ones who specifically kill their victims in order to have sex with
   their corpses, while for sadistic, experimental, and opportunistic
   offenders post-mortem sexual acts were part of a secondary deviant
   process. Practical implications in terms of criminal investigations and
   offenders' treatment are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{To better understand the effects of transient thermal stress in an
   aquatic insect, we first identified static temperatures associated with
   fitness deficits, and then reared larvae from egg hatch to adulthood
   under diurnally variable regimens including daily forays into
   deleterious temperatures. We sampled mature larvae at the coolest and
   warmest portions of their respective regimens for RNA-seq analysis. Few
   transcripts (28) were differentially expressed when larvae oscillated
   between favorable temperatures, while 614 transcripts were
   differentially expressed when experiencing daily transient thermal
   stress. Transcripts associated with N-glycan processing were
   downregulated while those associated with lipid catabolism and chitin
   turnover were significantly upregulated in heat stressed larvae. An
   across-regimen comparison of differentially expressed transcripts among
   organisms sampled at comparable temperatures demonstrated that the
   effects of daily thermal stress persisted even when larvae were sampled
   at a more optimal temperature (806 differentially expressed
   transcripts). The chronically stressed population had reduced expression
   of transcripts related to ATP synthesis, mitochondrial electron chain
   functions, gluconeogenesis and glycolytic processes while transcripts
   associated with cell adhesion, synaptic vesicle transport, regulation of
   membrane potential and lipid biosynthesis increased. Comparisons of
   constant vs. variable temperatures revealed that the negative
   consequences of time spent at stressful temperatures were not offset by
   more time spent at optimal temperatures.}},

Pages = {{1-12}},
Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{This introduction attempts to draw together the various threads which
   comprise this special issue and place them in the context of recent
   disruptions to the political order occasioned by the rise of populist
   politics, the resurgence of widespread racial tensions in a number of
   polities and the emergence of a global pandemic. Central to the
   challenges thrown up by these `events' and a motive force, has been the
   incremental advancement of libertarianism with its capacity to disorient
   and displace a more socially oriented liberalism. Together with a range
   of changes (some might argue enhancements) to our technological
   capacities these moves offer significant challenges to the advancement
   of a moral education that is sufficiently robust. The discussion moves
   from the development of historico-political readings of our present
   situation and challenge, through some important epistemic questions
   about truth-telling, integrity and sociality, and on to practical
   questions about the relationship between technology and personal moral
   capacities. This last challenge is explored with respect to the need to
   maintain the very analogue capacity of judgement in the face of a
   digitally mediated world. Moreover, this introduction also explores the
   structural and political challenges posed by narrow specialisation in
   the field of moral education, the evolution of biotechnology/materials
   and consciousness.}},

Abstract = {{Mass tourism has been creating increasing complaints and resistances in
   many tourist cities worldwide. The global Covid-19 health emergency has
   further affected the complex relationship between the activities of city
   dwellers and those of the tourist flows. Be the visitors present or
   abruptly absent, the effects of tourism on housing, labour, and the
   urban economy as a whole can threaten the very survival of a tourist
   destination. The ultimate goals of tourist-based transformations are not
   clear, nor their relationship with the resilience of destinations. A
   systemic perspective is here offered on tourism in cities, with a focus
   on the city that likely exhibits the highest level of tourist attraction
   with respect to its vulnerability, that is, Venice, Italy. Various
   aspects of its sustainability and resilience, along with the involved
   interconnection and dependency links, are taken into consideration.
   Currently proposed alternative scenarios are presented, and their
   weaknesses commented. Some implications are also addressed for
   sustainable and resilient transformations. The comprehension of the
   dynamics that drive a tourist city system, together with the study of
   its systemic leverage points, appear to be mandatory for effective urban
   policies and planning.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a longitudinal study, over eleven years, of the
   academic progress of a cohort of design students (n = 475) at a major
   Australian university. The students were from four different spatial
   design disciplines: architecture, industrial design, interior design,
   and landscape architecture. The article identifies cognitive variables
   that may predict future academic success. This research uses regression
   analysis to identify correlations across a range of variables, in
   particular exploring the relationship between university entrance
   scores, subjects studied at school (art and graphics) and academic
   success as defined by university grade point average and time to
   completion. This study shows that prior knowledge in art and graphics is
   not a useful predictor of future academic success, while university
   entrance scores and first year performance are related to ongoing
   academic success. These results suggest that for the design disciplines
   explored here, discipline-specific prior knowledge is not an important
   requirement for university entrance.}},

Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE}},
Abstract = {{Is mutual optimism a rationalist explanation for war? Countries are
   mutually optimistic if they have incompatible beliefs about the balance
   of power. Private information may fuel such beliefs, but it is unclear
   how rational countries could maintain incompatible beliefs if favorable
   information motivates a decision to fight, once countries incorporate
   their understanding of equilibrium strategies and later observe their
   enemy's decision to fight. I show that if countries have multiple
   reasons to fight-a favorable signal about the balance of power and a
   high resolve for the issue in dispute-then rational enemies can hold
   incompatible beliefs about the balance of power because an enemy's
   preference for war may not come from a favorable signal. Rational
   countries may even celebrate such an announcement, if it helps justify
   their own decision to fight. I discuss the implications of this argument
   for the causes of the First World War.}},

   Joints in a Ball Grid Array (BGA) Soldered on Printed Circuit Board

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS}},

Volume = {{50}},

Abstract = {{Ball grid array (BGA) packages have increasing applications in mobile
   phones, disk drives, LC displays and automotive engine controllers.
   However, the thermo-mechanical reliability of the BGA solder joints
   challenges the device functionality amidst component and system
   miniaturisation as well as wider adoption of lead-free solders. This
   investigation determines the effective BGA solders for improved
   thermo-mechanical reliability of the devices. It utilised a conducted
   study on creep response of a lead-based eutectic Sn63Pb37 and four
   lead-free Tin-Silver-Copper (SnAgCu) {[}SAC305, SAC387, SAC396 and
   SAC405] solders subjected to thermal cycling loadings and isothermal
   ageing. The solders form the joints between the BGAs and printed circuit
   boards (PCBs). ANSYS R19.0 package is used to simulate isothermal ageing
   of some of the assemblies at - 40 degrees C, 25 degrees C, 75 degrees C
   and 150 degrees C for 45 days and model the thermal cycling history of
   the other assemblies from 22 degrees C ambient temperature for six
   cycles. The response of the solders is simulated using the
   Garofalo-Arrhenius creep model. Under thermal ageing, SAC396 solder
   joints demonstrate possession of least strain energy density,
   deformation and von Mises stress in comparison to the other solders.
   Under thermal cycle loading conditions, SAC405 acquired the lowest
   amount of the damage parameters in comparison. Lead-free SAC405 and
   SAC387 joints accumulated the lowest and highest energy dissipation per
   cycle, respectively. It is concluded that SAC405 and SAC396 are the most
   effective solders for BGA in devices experiencing isothermal ageing and
   temperature cycling during operation, respectively. They are proposed as
   the suitable replacement of eutectic Sn63Pb37 solder for the various
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The U.S. elderly experience shorter lifespans and greater variability in
   age at death than their Canadian peers. In order to gain insight on the
   underlying factors responsible for the Canada-U.S. old-age mortality
   disparities, we propose a cause-of-death analysis. Accordingly, the
   objective of this paper is to compare levels and trends in
   cause-specific modal age at death (M) and standard deviation above the
   mode (SD(M +)) between Canada and the U.S. since the 1970s. We focus on
   six broad leading causes of death, namely cerebrovascular diseases,
   heart diseases, and four types of cancers. Country-specific M and SD(M
   +) estimates for each leading cause of death are calculated from
   P-spline smooth age-at-death distributions obtained from detailed
   population and cause-specific mortality data. Our results reveal similar
   levels and trends in M and SD(M +) for most causes in the two countries,
   except for breast cancer (females) and lung cancer (males), where
   differences are the most noticeable. In both of these instances, modal
   lifespans are shorter in the U.S. than in Canada and U.S. old-age
   mortality inequalities are greater. These differences are explained in
   part by the higher stratification along socioeconomic lines in the U.S.
   than in Canada regarding the adoption of health risk behaviours and
   access to medical services.}},

Abstract = {{Zinc deficiency is a major problem in production of rice crop, resulting
   in low grain Zn content. Use efficiency of conventional Zn sources

   Nanoformulations of Zn, i.e. zincated nanoclay polymer composites
   (ZNCPCs), nano-ZnO (foliar application) and zinc solubilizer
   (Azospirillum brasilense), were compared with ZnSO4 center dot 7H(2)O
   (soil and foliar application) in rice (Oryza sativa var. Rajendra
   Mahsuri) rhizosphere at various phenological growth stages (maximum
   tillering, panicle initiation and harvesting). Effect of various Zn
   carriers on soil microbial population, enzymatic activities, DTPA-Zn
   content and Zn uptake was documented in pot experiment in Zn-deficient
   soil (DTPA-extractable Zn 0.48 mg kg(-1)). DTPA-extractable Zn content
   in soil at harvesting stage was found to be maximum in T-6 (3.50 mg
   kg(-1)) followed by T-4 (3.46 mg kg(-1)). Microbial population
   (bacteria, actinomycetes, fungi and zinc-solubilizing bacteria) was
   recorded to be highest in T-4 (RDF + Azospirillum brasilense) followed
   by T-6 (ZNCPC) at panicle initiation, maximum tillering and harvesting
   stages. Dehydrogenase activity was higher at maximum tillering stage in
   T-6 (ZNCPC) followed by that in T-4. Acid and alkaline phosphatase
   activities were found to be maximum at panicle initiation stage in T-6
   followed by T-4 treatment. ZNCPC and zinc solubilizers stimulated soil
   microbial population consequently increasing the soil enzymatic
   activities and resulted in release of DTPA-extractable Zn in the rice
   rhizosphere. Maximum zinc uptake was recorded in treatment T-6 (ZNCPC)
   Zn (303.42 mg kg(-1)). ZNCPC proved to be a promising fertilizer in
   increasing Zn use efficiency in rice rhizosphere. Findings of the
   present investigation need to be further evaluated in long-term field
   experiment to identify its cost/benefit ratio.}},

Abstract = {{A liquid crystal (LC) droplet pattern-based sensor used to detect lead
   ions (Pb2+) in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) solution using
   single-stranded DNAzyme has been reported. When Pb2+ were present, it
   bound to the DNAzyme, leading to the release of
   tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (OTAB). These OTAB molecules were
   absorbed onto the aqueous/LC interface and helped in arranging the LC
   orientation. A planar-to-homeotropic order transition of LC droplets was
   triggered during this event. The reported naked-eye optical sensor
   possesses a limit of detection (LOD) of about 0.7 nM in PBS and 0.8 nM
   in tap water. The proposed LC dropletbased sensor was highly sensitive
   and selective for label-free Pb2+ detection. This sensor also provided a
   platform for the detection of proteins, DNA, and other metal ions by
   modifying the receptor.}},

   European Union, through tests for the order of integration and cluster
   analysis, in order to investigate the occurrence of two types of
   convergence: between genders and among European countries. The paper
   makes two contributions to the literature: (1) theoretically, it
   provides useful insights into the macroeconomic determinants of
   self-employment; (2) methodologically, it uses unit roots, fractional
   integration and cluster analysis to assess convergence. The empirical
   results point at mixed evidence of convergence, but with clear

Title = {{Effect of the crust on neutron star empirical relations}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{We analyze how the crust equation of state affects several neutron star
   properties and how it impacts on possible constraints inferred from
   astrophysical observations. Using three distinct crusts, we generate
   three sets of model-independent equations of state describing stellar
   matter from a Taylor expansion around saturation density. The equations
   of state are thermodynamically consistent, causal, and compatible with
   astrophysical observations. The relations between the tidal
   deformability Lambda and compactness C, Love number k(2) and radius of
   neutron star with mass M are studied, and the effect of the crust
   equation of state on these relations analyzed. In most of the relations,
   the impact of the crust equation of state is not larger that 2\%. If,
   however, a fixed neutron star mass is considered, the relation between
   the tidal deformability and the radius depends on the crust. We have
   found that the relation Lambda M-i = alpha R-Mi(beta), becomes almost
   exact and crust independent for massive neutron stars. It is shown that
   it is possible to determine the tidal deformability of an 1.4 M-circle
   dot star from the GW179817 effective tidal deformability (Lambda) over
   tilde with an accuracy of at least approximate to 10\%. A high
   correlation between A and the radius of the most massive star of the
   neutron star binary was confirmed, however, it was demonstrated that the
   crust has an effect of approximate to 14\% on this relation. We have
   found that the relation Lambda(1)/Lambda(2) = qa depends on M-chirp as a
   similar to root M-chirp.}},

   Patent Foramen Ovale: A Left Atrial Longitudinal Strain Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: The study of left atrial (LA) longitudinal strain by speckle
   tracking is a reliable method for analyzing LA function that could
   provide relevant information in young patients with cryptogenic stroke
   (CS). The aim of this study was to investigate whether the presence of a
   patent foramen ovale (PFO) impacts the LA longitudinal strain in a
   population of young patients with first CS.
   Methods and Results: Patients aged 18 to 54 years, treated consecutively
   in a university hospital for first CS, were included in this study. The
   presence of a PFO and an atrial septal aneurysm (ASA) was investigated
   using transesophageal echocardiography and transcranial Doppler. Speckle
   tracking analysis was performed on transthoracic echocardiography,
   allowing the measurement of global, passive, and active longitudinal LA
   strain, corresponding to the reservoir, conduit, and contractile
   function, respectively. A total of 51 patients were included in the
   study. In a multivariable analysis, overweight was associated with
   reduced global and passive LA longitudinal strain (P = 0.013 and P =
   0.018, respectively), and hypertension was associated with reduced
   active LA longitudinal strain (P = 0.049). LA longitudinal strain was
   not different between patients with PFO or PFO plus ASA and patients
   without PFO.
   Conclusion: LA longitudinal strain in young subjects with CS was
   impaired in the presence of overweight and hypertension, but not of PFO
   or PFO plus ASA.}},

Abstract = {{The optical extinction spectra arising from localized surface plasmon
   resonance in doped semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) have intensities and
   lineshapes determined by free charge carrier concentrations and various
   mechanisms for damping the oscillation of those free carriers. However,
   these intrinsic properties are convoluted by heterogeneous broadening
   when measuring the spectra of ensembles. We reveal that the traditional
   Drude approximation is not equipped to fit spectra from a heterogeneous
   ensemble of doped semiconductor NCs and produces fit results that
   violate Mie scattering theory. The heterogeneous ensemble Drude
   approximation (HEDA) model rectifies this issue by accounting for
   ensemble heterogeneity and near-surface depletion. The HEDA model is
   applied to tin-doped indium oxide NCs for a range of sizes and doping
   levels, but we expect it to be employed for any isotropic plasmonic
   particles in the quasistatic regime. It captures individual NC optical
   properties and their contributions to the ensemble spectra, thereby
   enabling the analysis of intrinsic NC properties from an ensemble
   measurement. Quality factors for the average NC in each ensemble are
   quantified and found to be notably higher than those of the ensemble.
   Carrier mobility and conductivity derived from the HEDA fits matches
   that reported in the bulk thin-film literature.}},

Abstract = {{The success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies for
   treating leukemia has resulted in a booming interest for the technology.
   Expression of a CAR in T cells allows redirection of their natural
   cytolytic activity toward cells presenting a specific designated surface
   antigen. Although CAR T cell therapies have thus far shown promising
   results mostly in B cell malignancy trials, interest in their potential
   to treat other diseases is on the rise, including using CAR T cells to
   control human immunodeficiency virus infection. The assessment of CAR T
   cell potency toward specific targets in vitro is a critical preclinical
   step. In this study, we describe novel assays that monitor the
   cytotoxicity of candidate CAR T cells toward simian immunodeficiency
   virus (SIV) infected CD4 T cells. The assays involve live cell imaging
   using a fluorescence microscopy system that records in real time the
   disappearance or appearance of targets infected with SIV carrying a
   fluorescent protein gene. The assays are highly reproducible, and their
   rapid turn around and reduced cost present a significant advance
   regarding the efficient preclinical evaluation of CAR T cell constructs
   and are broadly applicable to potential human diseases that could
   benefit from CAR T cell therapy.}},

Title = {{Contributions of Hippocampal Volume to Cognition in Healthy Older Adults}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The association between hippocampal volume and memory is
   continuing to be characterized in healthy older adults. Prior research
   suggests smaller hippocampal volume in healthy older adults is
   associated with poorer episodic memory and processing speed, as well as
   working memory, verbal learning, and executive functioning as measured
   by the NIH Toolbox Fluid (Fluid Cognition Composite, FCC) and
   Crystalized Cognition Composites (CCC). This study aimed to replicate
   these findings and to evaluate the association between: (1) hippocampal
   asymmetry index and cognition; and (2) independent contributions of the
   left and right hippocampal volume and cognition in a large sample of
   healthy older adults.
   Participants and Methods: One-hundred and eighty-three healthy older
   adults (M age = 71.72, SD = 5.3) received a T1-weighted sequence on a 3T
   scanner. Hippocampal subfields were extracted using FreeSurfer 6.0 and
   combined to provide left, right, and total hippocampal volumes. FCC
   subtests include Dimensional Change Card Sort, Flanker Inhibitory
   Control and Attention, List Sorting, Picture Sequence Memory, and
   Pattern Comparison. CCC subtests include Picture Vocabulary and Oral
   Reading Recognition. Multiple linear regressions were performed
   predicting cognition composites from the total, left and right, and
   asymmetry of hippocampal volume, controlling for sex, education,
   scanner, and total intracranial volume. Multiple comparisons in primary
   analyses were corrected using a false discovery rate (FDR) of p < 0.05.
   Results: FCC scores were positively associated with total (beta = 0.226,
   FDR q = 0.044) and left (beta = 0.257, FDR q = 0.024) hippocampal
   volume. Within FCC, Picture Sequence Memory scores positively associated
   with total (beta = 0.284, p = 0.001) and left (beta = 0.98, p = 0.001)
   hippocampal volume. List Sorting scores were also positively associated
   with left hippocampal volume (beta = 0.189, p = 0.029).
   Conclusions: These results confirm previous research suggesting that
   bilateral hippocampal volume is associated with FCC, namely episodic
   memory. The present study also suggests the left hippocampal volume may
   be more broadly associated with both episodic and working memory.
   Studies should continue to investigate lateralized hippocampal
   contributions to aging processes to better identify predictors of
   cognitive decline.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To test the effectiveness (Participant A) and tolerability
   (Participant B) of urinary stone comminution in the first-in-human trial
   of a new technology, burst-wave lithotripsy (BWL).
   Materials and Methods: An investigational BWL and ultrasonic propulsion
   system was used to target a 7-mm kidney stone in the operating room
   before ureteroscopy (Participant A). The same system was used to target
   a 7.5 mm ureterovesical junction stone in clinic without anesthesia
   (Participant B).
   Results: For Participant A, a ureteroscope inserted after 9 minutes of
   BWL observed fragmentation of the stone to <2 mm fragments. Participant
   B tolerated the procedure without pain from BWL, required no anesthesia,
   and passed the stone on day 15.
   Conclusions: The first-in-human tests of BWL pulses were successful in
   that a renal stone was comminuted in <10 minutes, and BWL was also
   tolerated by an awake subject for a distal ureteral stone.

Abstract = {{Most cancer cells are exposed to altered extracellular environments,
   such as an increase in extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness and soluble
   signals consisting of growth factors and cytokines. It is therefore
   conceivable that changes in tumor extracellular environments affect
   tumor cell behavior. The Hippo pathway reportedly responds to the
   extracellular environment and regulates the nuclear localization of the
   transcription co-activator, yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional
   co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). Inactivation of the Hippo
   pathway with nuclear translocation of YAP/TAZ stimulates cell
   proliferation. Its pathway also regulates gene expression, but the
   precise molecule(s) meditating the cell-proliferating effect of YAP
   signaling on oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is unclear. First, we
   examined the effects of YAP signaling on OSCC tumorigenesis.
   Loss-of-function experiments using siRNA or an inhibitor, and
   immunohistochemical analyses of tissue specimens obtained from OSCC
   patients demonstrated that YAP signaling was involved in OSCC cell
   proliferation. Second, we identified Piezo-type mechanosensitive ion
   channel component 1 (PIEZO1), a Ca2+ channel, as a transcriptional
   target of YAP signaling and showed that elevated PIEZO1 was required for
   PIEZO1 agonist-dependent Ca2+ entry and cell proliferation in OSCC
   cells. Experiments using three-dimensional and suspension culture
   revealed that PIEZO1 was involved in OSCC cellular growth. Finally, YAP
   overexpression in the nucleus and/or cytoplasm was immunohistochemically
   detected in tumor lesions with frequent expression of both PIEZO1 and
   Ki-67, but not in non-tumor regions of OSCC specimens. These results
   suggest that the YAP/PIEZO1 axis promotes OSCC cell growth. (c) 2020 The

Journal = {{MORPHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{243-260}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Previous corpus studies have shown that the English spelling system is
   `morpho-graphic' (Berg and Aronoff 2017) in that affixes are spelt in a
   consistent way (e.g., < ous(sic) in famous) that distinguishes them from
   homophonous word endings without grammatical function (e.g., < us(sic)
   in bonus). The present paper investigates if English spellers apply
   these regularities to the spelling of novel words implicitly and whether
   the application of those regularities is modulated by experience with
   the English writing system. Participants with varying degrees of
   expertise in the English writing system were asked to spell novel words
   ending in //, which were presented orally in either an adjective context
   (i.e., biasing towards the affix spelling < ous(sic)) or a noun context
   (i.e., biasing towards an alternative spelling such as < us(sic)). The
   results showed that the adjective context elicited significantly more <
   ous(sic) spellings than the noun context, indicating that participants
   applied morpho-graphic spelling regularities to novel words to mark the
   appropriate lexical category. Additionally, there was a modulation by
   spelling ability: The higher participants' expertise in the English
   spelling system was, the more novel words they spelt according to
   morpho-graphic spelling regularities. In conclusion, English spellers
   are aware of the morpho-graphic spelling regularities without explicit
   instruction and apply these to novel words. They gradually induce the
   regularities from the input, which results in more robust rule
   application with increased experience and expertise in the English
   writing system.}},

Journal = {{PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS}},
Abstract = {{Objectives To reveal a first-trimester sonographic marker associated
   with combined duodenal and esophageal atresia (DA and EA).
   Methods This retrospective study included four patients referred to our
   department in the first trimester due to fetal stomach anomaly. In the
   literature, we found 20 additional cases of combined DA and EA with four
   of them to be revealed at 12 weeks.
   Results We present the largest for to date case series of combined DA
   and pure EA diagnosed in the first trimester including one with
   additional visualization of the distal esophageal pouch and its
   communication with the stomach. All our cases and four previously
   published reports (including two cases of DA and EA with
   tracheoesophageal fistula {[}TEF]) were characterized by the presence of
   ``band neutrophil{''} sign-a symmetrical C-shaped loop in the fetal
   abdomen, occupying a central position close to the anterior abdominal
   wall. Similar findings could be seen also later in pregnancy, but they
   lack the same prognostic value.
   Conclusions Band neutrophil sign is a pathognomonic first-trimester
   ultrasound marker of combined DA and EA irrespective of the presence of
   TEF. Nevertheless, it should be further evaluated in prospective
   studies.}},

Title = {{Rule maker or rule taker? Brexit, finance and UK regulatory autonomy}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW}},
Abstract = {{Given the integration of the City of London into the single market for
   financial services in the European Union (EU), theories of transnational
   governance would expect the United Kingdom (UK) to favour close
   regulatory alignment with the EU27 post-Brexit to maximise market access
   and financial stability. Surprisingly, however, the UK has consistently
   demanded regulatory flexibility in financial services and has accepted
   reduced market access. We argue that the explanation is twofold. First,
   UK preferences reflect the need to balance the competing demands of
   elected officials, the financial industry and financial regulators.
   Second, drawing on a bureaucratic politics perspective, we suggest that
   UK preferences have been strongly shaped by the importance to UK
   regulators of retaining autonomy over high-status policy competences.
   This article contributes to the broader literature on the politics of
   financial regulation by highlighting the added value of incorporating a
   bureaucratic politics perspective when explaining financial regulatory
   preferences.}},

Abstract = {{Question How often are cell-free DNA (cfDNA) studies in prostate cancer
   confounded by clonal hematopoiesis (CHIP) variants in genes used for
   poly(ADP) ribose polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) eligibility? Findings In
   this case series study of 69 men with advanced prostate cancer, 7 (10\%)
   had CHIP variants in genes used for US Food and Drug
   Administration-approved indications of PARPi treatment, most frequently
   in ATM. Meaning Men with prostate cancer are at high risk of being
   misdiagnosed as being eligible for PARPi therapy using current cfDNA
   tests; assays should use a whole-blood control sample to distinguish
   CHIP variants from prostate cancer.
   This case series study examines the prevalence of clonal hematopoiesis
   and its potential interference in prostate cancer cell-free DNA testing.
   Importance Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) testing is increasingly used in the
   treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer. Clonal
   hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) can interfere with cfDNA
   testing and cause incorrect interpretation of results. There is an
   urgent need to better understand this problem following recent US Food
   and Drug Administration approval of poly(ADP) ribose polymerase
   inhibitors (PARPi) for metastatic prostate cancer based on variants in
   DNA repair genes that can be affected by CHIP. Objective To determine
   the prevalence of clinically relevant CHIP interference in prostate
   cancer cfDNA testing. Design, Setting, and Participants We report a case
   series of 69 patients with advanced prostate cancer (metastatic disease
   or with rising PSA following localized therapy) who had cfDNA variant
   testing with a large panel cancer next generation sequencing assay
   (UW-OncoPlexCT). To determine the source of variants in plasma, we
   tested paired cfDNA and whole blood control samples. The study was
   carried out in an academic medical center system reference laboratory.
   Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence and gene spectrum of CHIP
   interference in patients with prostate cancer undergoing cfDNA testing.
   Results We detected CHIP variants at 2\% or more variant fraction in
   cfDNA from 13 of 69 men with prostate cancer (19\%; 95\% CI, 10\%-30\%).
   Seven men (10\%; 95\% CI, 4\%-20\%) had CHIP variants in DNA repair
   genes used to determine PARPi candidacy, including ATM (n = 5), BRCA2 (n
   = 1), and CHEK2 (n = 1). Overall, CHIP variants accounted for almost
   half of the somatic DNA repair gene variants detected. Participant CHIP
   variants were exponentially correlated with older age (R-2 = 0.82). CHIP
   interference variants could be distinguished from prostate cancer
   variants using a paired whole-blood control. Conclusions and Relevance
   In this case series, approximately 10\% of men with advanced prostate
   cancer had CHIP interference in plasma cfDNA in DNA repair genes that
   are used for eligibility of PARPi therapy, most frequently in ATM.
   Clinical cfDNA testing should include a paired whole-blood control to
   exclude CHIP variants and avoid misdiagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{Culturally adapted cognitive behavioral therapy (CA-CBT) is a
   well-evaluated, transdiagnostic group intervention for refugees that
   uses psychoeducation, meditation, and stretching exercises. In the
   current study, we added problem-solving training to CA-CBT and evaluated
   this treatment (i.e., CA-CBT+) in a randomized controlled pilot trial
   with a sample of Farsi-speaking refugees. Participants (N = 24) were
   male refugees diagnosed with DSM-5 PTSD, major depressive disorder, and
   anxiety disorders who were randomly assigned to either a treatment or
   waitlist control (WLC) condition. Treatment components were adapted both
   to the specific cultural background and the current social problems of
   asylum seekers. Assessments were performed pretreatment, 12-weeks
   posttreatment, and 1-year follow-up. The primary treatment outcome was
   the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28); secondary outcome measures
   included the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist, Patient Health
   Questionnaire, Somatic Symptom Scale, World Health Organization Quality
   of Life, and Emotion Regulation Scale. Eleven of 12 participants were
   randomized to CA-CBT+ completed treatment. Based on intent-to-treat
   data, large between-group effect sizes were seen at posttreatment in the
   GHQ-28, d = 3.0, and for most secondary outcome measures. Improvements
   for individuals in the treatment group decreased at 1-year follow-up,
   but effect sizes demonstrated continued large improvements on all
   measures as compared to pretreatment levels. In summary, CA-CBT+ led to
   large improvements in general psychopathological distress and quality of
   life, which were maintained in the long term. In addition, the dropout
   rate was very low, with delivery in group format. Thus, problem-solving
   training appears to be a promising addition to CA-CBT.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate how communication
   within the Swedish sickness insurance system differs between cases of
   sick leave and how this may affect clients' cases. Materials and
   methods: This was a document study using 30 client files from the
   Swedish Social Insurance Agency (SIA). The clients included had been on
   a work ability evaluation during their sick leave spell and were aged
   32-64 years. The material was analyzed using qualitative document
   analysis. Results: The results show different approaches to
   communication, characterized by emotional argumentation, matter-of-fact
   driven argumentation and information exchange, which have diverse
   success in affecting official decisions. Arguments characterized by
   emotions such as frustration or desperation are to a larger extent
   neglected by the authorities compared to those characterized by a
   matter-of-fact driven approach and referring to regulations and medical
   certificates. Conclusion: There are differences regarding how clients
   and stakeholders communicate the clients' needs and pre-requisites, and
   how this affects official decisions. Further research must be carried
   out in order to establish social insurance literacy, initially for
   individuals on sick leave within the sickness insurance system, and
   whether there are differences between diverse groups that could lead to
   injustices.}},

Title = {{Crystal methamphetamine use among young people entering custody:
   Prevalence, correlates and comorbidity}},
Journal = {{DRUG AND ALCOHOL REVIEW}},
Abstract = {{Introduction and Aims Crystal methamphetamine (CM) is associated with a
   range of physical and mental health harms and may be of particular
   concern among young people at risk of early, problematic substance use,
   such as those in contact with the criminal justice system. This study
   aimed to investigate the prevalence and correlates of regular (i.e. at
   least weekly) CM use among young people preceding entry into custody.
   Design and Methods Data were collected from 207 participants aged 14-18
   years as part of the 2015 Young People in Custody Health Survey, a
   cross-sectional survey of youth in custody in New South Wales,
   Australia. Participants were administered face-to-face structured
   interviews assessing sociodemographic, childhood and family
   characteristics, offending history, substance use and psychopathology.
   Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify
   factors independently associated with regular CM use.
   Results Regular CM use was reported by 31\% of participants and was
   independently associated with higher levels of antisocial
   traits/behaviour {[}adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.13, 95\% confidence
   interval (CI) 1.02, 1.25], increased polydrug use (AOR 1.34, 95\% CI
   1.14, 1.58), injecting drug use (AOR 4.06, 95\% CI 1.02, 16.16) and
   meeting symptom thresholds for two or more current psychological
   disorders (AOR 3.20, 95\% CI 1.15, 8.94).
   Discussion and Conclusions Regular CM users present with more complex
   comorbidity than other young people in custody, increasing the
   health-care burden in custodial and community settings. Early
   identification and appropriate treatment of this comorbidity is crucial
   to improving the health, psychosocial and behavioural outcomes of this
   vulnerable group.}},

Abstract = {{Circular-harmonic spectra are a compact representation of local image
   features in two dimensions. It is well known that the computational
   complexity of such transforms is greatly reduced when polar separability
   is exploited in steerable filter-banks. Further simplifications are
   possible when Cartesian separability is incorporated using the radial
   apodization (i.e. weight, window, or taper) described here, as a
   consequence of the Laguerre/Hermite correspondence over polar/Cartesian
   coordinates. The chosen form also mitigates undesirable discretization
   artefacts due to angular aliasing. The local angular spectrum at each
   pixel is deployed in a novel test-statistic to detect and characterize
   corners of arbitrary angle and orientation (i.e. wedges). The
   test-statistic considers uncertainty due to finite sampling and
   clutter/noise. The possible utility of this detector, and
   circular-harmonic spectra for the description of simple features in
   general, is illustrated using real data from an overhead electro-optic
   sensor. Monte-Carlo simulations are also performed to quantify
   performance relative to other simple corner detectors. Possible computer
   realizations for a small remote-sensing platform are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding potential risks, vulnerabilities, and impacts to weather
   extremes and climate change are key information needs for coastal
   planners and managers in support of climate adaptation. Assessing
   historical trends and potential socio-economic impacts is especially
   difficult in the Arctic given limitations on availability of weather
   observations and historical impacts. This study utilizes a novel
   interdisciplinary approach that integrates archival analysis,
   observational data, and climate model downscaling to synthesize
   information on historical and projected impacts of extreme weather
   events in Nome, Alaska. Over 300 impacts (1990-2018) are identified
   based on analyses of the Nome Nugget newspaper articles and Storm Data
   entries. Historical impacts centered on transportation, community
   activities, and utilities. Analysis of observed and ERA5 reanalysis data
   indicates that impacts are frequently associated with high wind, extreme
   low temperatures, heavy snowfall events, and winter days above freezing.
   Downscaled output (2020-2100) from two climate models suggests that
   there will be changes in the frequency and timing of these extreme
   weather events. For example, extreme cold temperature is projected to
   decrease through the 2040s and then rarely occurs afterwards, and
   extreme wind events show little change before the 2070s. Significantly,
   our findings also reveal that not all weather-related extremes will
   change monotonically throughout the twenty-first century, such as
   extreme snowfall events that will increase through the 2030s before
   declining in the 2040s. The dynamical nature of projected changes in
   extreme events has implications for climate adaptation planning.}},

Title = {{Performance assessment of a heat pump and a concentrated photovoltaic
   thermal system during the wood drying process}},
Journal = {{APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{180}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Wood drying is an unavoidable step to bring to the market products with
   higher added value. Achieving drying under certain economic conditions
   requires calculating the drying cost with great precision while
   minimizing energy consumption. Conventional dryers with very high
   heating power are useful, but their energy consumption and greenhouse
   gas emissions remain too high. This work aims to propose a water/air
   heat pump powered by a concentrated photovoltaic thermal as a new hybrid
   solution for carrying out the drying process of softwood. The drying
   system consists of four main units, a drying chamber, a Closed Feed Air
   Heater, a water/air heat pump and a concentrated photovoltaic thermal.
   The study is based on the establishment of energy and mass balances in
   the drying system. The governing equations of the drying model are
   solved using the finite difference method. A perfect agreement is
   obtained between experimental and numerical results. The results show
   that the electrical energy consumption ratio using a heat pump as the
   main heater device fluctuates between 29 and 52 kWh.m(-3). The
   coefficient of performance also ranges from 3.91 to 7.2. The results
   show that a decrease of the heat pump set temperature from 75 to 65
   degrees C improves the coefficient of performance at least 17\%. The
   combined use of heat pump and concentrated photovoltaic thermal system
   has the effect of reducing the energy consumption ratio up to 86\%. The
   effect of parameters such as optical efficiency, concentration ratio and
   evaporator air temperature on drying performance is investigated. The
   results show that the heat recovered at the Closed Feed Air Heater
   increases as the temperature of air leaving the dryer increases. A
   decrease in optical efficiency from 0.9 to 0.65 increases the electrical
   energy consumption ratio by 73\%. An increase in the aperture area from
   100 to 150 m(2) also improves electricity production and drying capacity
   by 45 and 27\%, respectively. The drying capacity has known an increase
   of about 43\% by increasing the mass flow rate from 0.6 to 1 kg.s(-1).
   Finally, the combined use of a heat pump and a concentrated photovoltaic
   thermal can reduce significantly the electrical energy consumption and
   improve thermal performance of drying systems throughout the year.}},

Title = {{Mobilization vs. Demobilization Discourses on Social Media}},
Journal = {{POLITICAL COMMUNICATION}},
Abstract = {{While scholarly attention has been devoted to social media's potential
   mobilizing function, they may also contribute to demobilization
   discourses: social communication actively promoting nonvoting. This
   paper examines discourses around mobilization vs. demobilization in the
   context of the municipal elections in Jerusalem. As the sweeping
   majority of East Jerusalem Palestinians have continuously been
   boycotting Jerusalem's municipal elections, this is a potent case
   through which to examine how demobilization functions in action, through
   social media conversations. Using a mixed-methods analysis of Twitter
   contents as structured by different languages, our findings show how
   mobilization and demobilization discourses can co-occur during the same
   election event. Users of different languages - reflecting different
   social and political identities - interpret the elections in contrasting
   ways, with tangible implications for (in)equality in political
   participation. The study thus contributes theoretically to several
   domains of political communication, including election studies, local
   politics, and language fragmentation in online political discourse.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Breast cancer treatment has been associated with vascular
   pathology. It is unclear if such treatment is also associated with
   long-term cerebrovascular changes. We studied the association between
   radiotherapy and chemotherapy with carotid pathology and brain perfusion
   in breast cancer survivors. Methods We included 173 breast cancer
   survivors exposed to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, assessed +/- 21.2
   years after cancer diagnosis, and 346 age-matched cancer-free women
   (1:2) selected from the population-based Rotterdam Study. Outcome
   measures were carotid plaque score, intima-media thickness (IMT), total
   cerebral blood flow (tCBF), and brain perfusion. Additionally, we
   investigated the association between inclusion of the carotid artery in
   the radiation field (no/small/large part), tumor location, and these
   outcome measures within cancer survivors. Results Cancer survivors had
   lower tCBF (- 19.6 ml/min, 95\%CI - 37.3;- 1.9) and brain perfusion (-
   2.5 ml/min per 100 ml, 95\%CI - 4.3;- 0.7) than cancer-free women. No
   statistically significant group differences were observed regarding
   plaque score or IMT. Among cancer survivors, a large versus a small part
   of the carotid artery in the radiation field was associated with a
   higher IMT (0.05, 95\%CI0.01;0.09). Also, survivors with a right-sided
   tumor had lower left carotid plaque score (- 0.31, 95\%CI - 0.60;- 0.02)
   and higher brain perfusion (3.5 ml/min per 100 ml, 95\%CI 0.7;6.2) than
   those with a left-sided tumor. Conclusions On average two decades
   post-diagnosis, breast cancer survivors had lower tCBF and brain
   perfusion than cancer-free women. Also, survivors with a larger area of
   the carotid artery within the radiation field had a larger IMT. Future
   studies should confirm if these cerebrovascular changes underlie the
   frequently observed cognitive problems in cancer survivors.}},

Abstract = {{Depression is common in older adults and is associated with an increased
   risk of cognitive impairment. To clarify the possible roles of board
   game use in psychosomatic health promotion, this study evaluated the
   effects of board game activities in reducing depression in older adults.
   This was a quasi-experimental study. Purposive sampling was used to
   select 150 participants aged 65 years and above with intact mental
   functions who were currently residing in adult day care centers.
   Seventy-five participants who participated in 12 sessions of selected
   board game activities were assigned to the experimental group, and 75
   participants who adhered to their ordinary activities were allocated to
   the control group. Structured questionnaires were used for data
   collection. The board game activities showed promising effects on the
   depression levels of the investigated older adults living in adult day
   care centers. Therefore, one possible beneficial effect of board game
   activities may be reduced depression in older adults. The results of
   this study provide support for the mediating role of board game
   activities in the mental health of long-term care elders. Incorporating
   board game activities into social work may help to make it more diverse
   and innovative.}},

Title = {{Thirty years of trade data suggests population declines in a once common
   songbird in Indonesia}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{In Indonesia, the songbird trade is causing serious declines in many
   native species. Much of this trade is unregulated or illegal but
   nevertheless occurs openly in physical wildlife markets and online.
   Here, we report on the trade in a once common songbird, the Sunda
   laughingthrush (Garrulax palliatus), using compiled market data from 365
   bird market surveys across a 30-year period. We found a total of 5,281
   birds for sale, with the species encountered in roughly two-thirds of
   the visits. We observed a significant decrease in the number of Sunda
   laughingthrushes offered over time from similar to 50 birds/survey in
   the 1990s to similar to 20 birds/survey in the 2000s and < 10
   birds/survey in the 2010s, as well as a significant increase in the
   market price of the species, suggesting declining populations. In line
   with the countrywide findings, we found a decrease in the number of the
   species in the bird markets of Medan, but we did not find a similar
   decrease in Jakarta, suggesting a complex pattern of availability and
   demand. Nevertheless, this study shows that continued trapping for
   trade, if left unchecked, poses a significant risk to the species. We
   conclude that a more proactive stance from the government, including
   increasing levels of protection and enforcement of existing regulations,
   community engagement and possibly targeted captive breeding may
   alleviate the pressure on remaining wild populations. Our study offers a
   model whereby analysis of wildlife trade over extended periods of time
   covering vast geographic regions may offer insights that are easily
   missed when working in a too focused manner on single markets over short
   periods of time.}},

Title = {{Investigating variations of precipitation concentration in the
   transitional zone between Qinling Mountains and Loess Plateau in China:
   Implications for regional impacts of AO and WPSH}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Changes in precipitation patterns greatly impact regional drought/flood
   risk management and utilization of water resources. The main purpose of
   this paper was to investigate spatio-temporal variability of
   precipitation concentration in the transitional zone between Qinling
   Mountains (QDM), Guanzhong Plain (GZP) and the Loess Plateau (LPNS) in
   China, using monthly-scale precipitation concentration index (PCI) and
   daily-scale concentration index (CI) from daily rainfall records. The
   Mann-Kendall method was employed to illustrate the change in trend of
   PCI and CI, the Kriging interpolation method was adopted to measure
   spatial distribution, and the Wavelet transforms were used to explore
   their spatio-temporal correlation with the Arctic Oscillation (AO) \&
   Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) for revealing the potential
   attribution of precipitation concentration variation. Also, the regional
   implication of CI was investigated in the zone to provide local
   knowledge of the index application. Results showed that annual
   precipitation demonstrated a north-south increasing layered spatial
   distribution in the zone, representing a generally decreasing trend. The
   CI change generally exhibited a more significant decreasing trend than
   did PCI in LPNS and GZP due to AO slowly increasing over time, with a
   spatially weak layered or radial north-south decay, and an insignificant
   increasing trend in QDM impacted by the enhancing WPSH, with an obvious
   layered or radial spatial distribution. The spatiotemporal pattern of
   PCI variation represented similar characteristics in attribution with
   CI, but an inverse spatial distribution due to the phase difference
   (positive and negative effects) of AO and WPSH influencing seasonal
   precipitation. Regional analysis of CI showed that the CI value with
   over 0.62 indicated that approximately 80\% of precipitation was
   contributed by 25\% of the rainiest days in this zone. Fortunately, the
   area with this high CI has been getting smaller, implying a positive
   trend toward regional flash flood and debris flow control.}},

Title = {{Adaptive stabilisation via passive identifier for an ODE system cascaded
   by coupled parabolic equations with serious uncertainties}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTROL}},
Abstract = {{Stabilisation via adaptive feedback is investigated for an ODE system
   cascaded by coupled parabolic equations. The remarkable characteristic
   of the system is the presence of serious uncertainties since no known or
   bounded intervals are needed for the unknown parameters. Besides, strong
   coupling exists in the PDE subsystem which brings essential difference
   compared with those of the related literature. For this, a passive
   identifier is skillfully constructed firstly, and in turn adaptive laws
   are given to compensate the serious parametric unknowns. Then, by
   constructing a backstepping transformation and its inverse one, the
   identifier joint with the original system is transformed into a new
   system. From the new system, an adaptive state-feedback controller is
   designed which ensures that all the states of the closed-loop system are
   bounded and particularly those of the original system converge to zero.
   Finally, a numerical example is provided to validate the proposed
   algorithm.}},

Title = {{Solving the last mile problem in logistics: A mobile edge computing and
   blockchain-based unmanned aerial vehicle delivery system}},
Journal = {{CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE \& EXPERIENCE}},
Abstract = {{The ``last mile{''} problem in logistics is challenging due to its low
   efficiency and high cost. To address this problem, Unmanned Aerial
   Vehicle (UAV) delivery such as drone delivery has been proposed and
   widely accepted as a promising solution. However, currently most of the
   existing UAV delivery systems are based on Cloud Computing which cannot
   efficiently meet the requirements of many real-time services in UAV
   delivery systems. Meanwhile, the security issues in UAV delivery systems
   also raise critical concerns due to the existence of multiple
   participants (such as the sender, middler, and receiver) who may not
   maintain a mutual trust relationship among them. How to secure the UAV
   delivery process in such an untrusted environment is still a challenging
   issue. In this paper, we propose a Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and
   blockchain-based UAV delivery system to resolve the ``last mile{''}
   problem in logistics. Specifically, based on the MEC architecture, the
   blockchain nodes are deployed on the edge nodes to facilitate and secure
   the UAV delivery process. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed
   solution, a MEC-based UAV delivery system prototype with a private
   blockchain on the Ethereum platform is implemented. Through the security
   analysis and performance evaluation, it is proven that our proposed
   solution can effectively solve the ``last mile{''} problem and address
   the security issues in UAV delivery systems.}},

Abstract = {{Advanced oxidation technologies based on peroxymonosulfate (PMS) have
   attracted increasing attention because of their high reactivity and

   elimination. The influence of extra addition, simulation wastewater
   tests and the reusability experiments were investigated in detail.
   Remarkably, the quenching experiments and the results of EPR
   demonstrated the synergistic effect of radical and nonradical pathways
   in the TC degradation. Free radicals (SO4-(center dot) and HO center
   dot) played predominant roles in the first 1 min, and then both free and
   non-free radicals (O-1(2)) interacted with TC. The possible TC
   degradation pathways were proposed on basis of the intermediates, which
   were analyzed by UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS. Finally, the reaction mechanisms of TC
   degradation in CoFeLa-LDH2/PMS system were proposed according to the

Abstract = {{Anthracnose susceptibility and ill-adapted flowering time severely
   affect Lupinus luteus yield, which has high seed protein content, is
   excellent for sustainable agriculture, but requires genetic improvement
   to fulfil its potential. This study aimed to (1) develop a genetic map;
   (2) define collinearity and regions of synteny with Lupinus
   angustifolius; and (3) map QTLs/candidate genes for anthracnose
   resistant and flowering time. A few linkage groups/genomic regions
   tended to be associated with segregation distortion, but did not affect
   the map. The developed map showed collinearity, and syntenic regions
   with L. angustifolius. Major QTLs were mapped in syntenic regions.
   Alleles from the wild parent and cultivar, explained 75\% of the
   phenotypic variance for anthracnose resistance and 83\% for early
   flowering, respectively. Marker sequences flanking the QTLs showed high
   homology with the Lanr1 gene and Flowering-locus-T of L. angustifolius.
   This suggests orthologous genes for both traits in the L. luteus genome.
   The findings are remarkable, revealing the potential to combine early
   flowering/anthracnose resistant in fulfilling yield capacity in L.
   luteus, and can be a major strategy in the genetic improvement and usage
   of this species for sustainable protein production. Allele sequences and
   PCR-marker tagging of these genes are being applied in marker assisted
   selection.}},

Title = {{The pelvis urinary microbiome in patients with kidney stones and
   clinical associations}},
Journal = {{BMC MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Background The long-held notion that, without urinary tract or
   circulatory infection, bladder urine and blood are sterile biofluids has
   been disproven. There have been no previous reports on the kidney pelvis
   urinary microbiome after bladder disinfection in kidney stone patients.
   This study aimed to determine whether a kidney pelvis urinary microbiome
   is present after eliminating the influence of the bladder urinary
   microbiome, whether the microbiome composition is different in patients
   with stone kidney pelvis (SKP) and non-stone kidney pelvis (NSKP), and
   the correlation between SKP and patient clinical characteristics.
   Results Comparisons of bacterial diversity and community structure
   exhibited that urine in bladder was similar to SKP and NSKP. However,
   the comparisons showed that urine samples were different from blood. The
   most common operational taxonomic units were shared by all three types
   of urine samples. Corynebacterium was significantly higher in SKP
   compared to NSKP. Several bacteria were associated with patient
   characteristics, including Lactobacillus, which was positively
   correlated with fasting blood glucose, and Prevotella was negatively
   correlated with BMI. Lactobacillus was significantly higher in SKP
   compared to blood but not in NSKP compared to blood. Conclusions The
   composition of the kidney pelvis urinary microbiome after disinfection
   of the bladder and its similarity to the bladder microbiome indicate
   that bladder urine can be used to replace kidney pelvis urine in
   microbiome research. Additionally, the comparison of SKP and NSKP and
   clinical associations suggest that the occurrence of kidney stones is
   responsible for the SKP urinary microbiome.}},

Abstract = {{Angiogenesis plays a vital role in tumor progression and metastasis. To
   better understand the role of anesthesia in tumor biology, we previously
   reported that bupivacaine displayed the inhibitory effects in
   endothelial cells. In this work, we demonstrated that fentanyl, an
   opioid medication commonly used in cancer patients, stimulated tumor
   angiogenesis. We found that fentanyl at nanomolar concentrations
   significantly stimulated capillary network formation of human lung
   tumor-associated endothelial cell (HLT-EC) in a similar manner as
   vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and furthermore that the
   stimulatory effect of fentanyl was mainly involved in early stage of
   HLT-EC vascular structure assembly. Particularly, fentanyl significantly
   increased HLT-EC growth and migration. Fentanyl also protected HLT-EC
   from apoptosis induced by growth factor withdrawal. In contrast, the
   same concentrations of fentanyl did not affect human lung cancer cell
   growth and survival. Fentanyl stimulated migration of some but not all
   tested human lung cancer cells. Mechanism analysis suggested that
   fentanyl activates multiple proangiogenic signaling pathways, including
   VEGFR2/FAK/PI3K/Akt and small GTPases. Our work systematically
   demonstrates that fentanyl stimulates tumor angiogenesis via activating
   multiple pro-angiogenic signaling pathways. Our findings highlight the
   potential adverse effect of fentanyl in cancer patients. (C) 2020

Abstract = {{Insect chemosensation is crucial for many aspects related to food
   seeking, enemy avoidance, and reproduction. Different families of
   receptors and binding proteins interact with chemical stimuli, including
   odorant receptors (ORs), ionotropic receptors (IRs), gustatory receptors
   (GRs), odorant binding proteins (OBPs) and chemosensory proteins (CSPs).
   In this work, we describe the chemosensory-related gene repertoire of
   the worldwide pest Spodoptera exigua (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), focusing
   on the transcripts expressed in larvae, which feed on many horticultural
   crops producing yield losses. A comprehensive de novo assembly that
   includes reads from chemosensory organs of larvae and adults, and other
   larval tissues, enabled us to annotate 200 candidate
   chemosensory-related genes encoding 63 ORs, 28 IRs, 38 GRs, 48 OBPs and
   23 CSPs. Of them, 51 transcripts are new annotations. Fifty ORs are
   expressed in larval heads based on RNA-seq and reverse transcription PCR
   analyses. Fourteen OBPs are expressed in larval, but not in adult heads.
   We also observe that expression profiles of ORs are strongly and
   non-specifically up-regulated upon pre-exposure of larvae to single
   volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Finally, we develop a behavioural
   assay to study the attraction/repellence to VOCs in S. exigua larvae and
   thus identify candidate ecologically relevant odours. A single-dose
   assay demonstrated that 1-hexanol triggers attraction and indole repels
   larvae at any timepoint. This work establishes the foundation for the
   study of chemosensation in S. exigua larvae, allowing further studies
   aimed to characterize chemosensory-related genes that underlie the
   ecologically relevant behaviours of larvae.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{20}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{The non-Hermitian skin effect, i.e., eigenstate condensation at the
   edges in lattices with open boundaries, is an exotic manifestation of
   non-Hermitian systems. In Bloch theory, an effective non-Hermitian
   Hamiltonian is generally used to describe dissipation, which, however,
   is not norm preserving and neglects quantum jumps. Here it is shown that
   in a self-consistent description of the dissipative dynamics in a
   one-band lattice, based on the stochastic Schrodinger equation or
   Lindblad master equation with a collective jump operator, the skin
   effect and its dynamical features are washed out. Nevertheless, both
   short- and long-time relaxation dynamics provide a hidden signature of
   the skin effect found in the semiclassical limit. In particular,
   relaxation toward a maximally mixed state with the largest von Neumann
   entropy in a lattice with open boundaries is a manifestation of the
   semiclassical skin effect.}},

Abstract = {{Transition-metal boron-rich compounds exhibit favorable synthesis
   conditions and mechanical properties that hold great promise for
   wide-ranging applications. However, the complex bonding networks of
   these compounds produce diverse structural and mechanical behaviors that
   require in-depth studies. A notable case is ZrB12, which has been
   reported to possess high Vickers hardness comparable to those of ReB2
   and WB4. Surprisingly, first-principles calculations of stress-strain
   relations reveal unexpected low indentation strengths of ZrB12 well
   below those of ReB2 and WB4. Such contrasting results are reconciled by
   noting that the additional presence of a boron-rich phase of ZrB50 in
   the experimental synthesis process likely plays a key role in the
   extrinsic strengthening. These findings uncover mechanisms for the
   higher measured strength of ZrB12 and offer insights for elucidating
   extrinsic hardening phenomena that may exist in other transition-metal
   compounds.}},

Abstract = {{Moving object tracking is an effective optimization procedure based on

   separations are done by modified kernel fuzzy c-means algorithm. The
   object detection and tracking are done by gravitational search
   algorithm-based deep belief neural network. The implementation will be
   in MATLAB. The effectiveness of the recommended strategy is assessed
   with means of precision, recall, F-measure, FPR, FNR, PWC, FAR,
   similarity, specificity, and accuracy. From the experimental results,
   the proposed work outperforms the state of artwork. Here, the proposed

Title = {{Transient top-down and bottom-up effects of resources pulsed to multiple
   trophic levels}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Pulsed fluxes of organisms across ecosystem boundaries can exert
   top-down and bottom-up effects in recipient food webs, through both
   direct effects on the subsidized trophic levels and indirect effects on
   other components of the system. While previous theoretical and empirical
   studies demonstrate the influence of allochthonous subsidies on
   bottom-up and top-down processes, understanding how these forces act in
   conjunction is still limited, particularly when an allochthonous
   resource can simultaneously subsidize multiple trophic levels. Using the
   Lake MATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH ACUTEvatn region in Iceland as an example
   system of allochthony and its potential effects on multiple trophic
   levels, we analyzed a mathematical model to evaluate how pulsed
   subsidies of aquatic insects affect the dynamics of a
   soil-plant-arthropod food web. We found that the relative balance of
   top-down and bottom-up effects on a given food web compartment was
   determined by trophic position, subsidy magnitude, and top predators'
   ability to exploit the subsidy. For intermediate trophic levels (e.g.,
   detritivores and herbivores), we found that the subsidy could either
   alleviate or intensify top-down pressure from the predator. For some
   parameter combinations, alleviation and intensification occurred
   sequentially during and after the resource pulse. The total effect of
   the subsidy on detritivores and herbivores, including top-down and
   bottom-up processes, was determined by the rate at which predator
   consumption saturated with increasing size of the allochthonous subsidy,
   with greater saturation leading to increased bottom-up effects. Our
   findings illustrate how resource pulses to multiple trophic levels can
   influence food web dynamics by changing the relative strength of
   bottom-up and top-down effects, with bottom-up predominating top-down
   effects in most scenarios in this subarctic system.}},

Title = {{Experimental Validation of a Computational Screening Approach to Predict
   Redox Potentials for a Diverse Variety of Redox-Active Organic Molecules}},

Abstract = {{Organic redox flow batteries are currently the focus of intense
   scientific interest because they have the potential to be developed into
   low-cost, environmentally sustainable solutions to the energy storage
   problem that stands in the way of widespread uptake of renewable power
   generation technologies. Because the search space of suitable
   redox-active electrolytes is large, computational screening is
   increasingly being employed as a tool to identify promising candidates.
   It is well known in the computational chemistry literature that redox
   potentials for organic molecules can be accurately calculated on a
   class-by-class basis, but the general utility and accuracy of the
   relatively low-cost quantum chemical methods used in high-throughput
   screening are currently unclear. In this work, we measure the redox
   potentials of 24 commonly available but chemically diverse redox-active
   organic molecules in acetonitrile, carefully controlling experimental
   errors by using an internal 3 reference (a ferrocene/ferrocenium redox
   couple), and compare these with redox potentials computed at
   B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) using a polarizable continuum model to account for
   solvation. Unlike previous large-scale computational screening studies,
   this work carefully establishes the accuracy of the computational
   procedure by benchmarking against experimental results. While previous
   small-scale computational studies have been carried out on structurally
   homologous compounds, this work assesses the accuracy of the
   computational model across a variety of compound classes, without
   applying class-dependent empirical corrections. We find that redox
   potential differences for coupled one-electron transfer processes can be
   computed to within 0.4 V and two-electron redox potential differences
   can usually be computed to within 0.15 V.}},

Title = {{Empathy for patient care in medical students: new evidence on the
   importance of self-transcendence}},
Journal = {{PSYCHOLOGY HEALTH \& MEDICINE}},
Abstract = {{Empathy is essential in clinical care to achieve patient satisfaction,
   treatment adherence and health outcomes. Understanding how personality
   traits might influence the development of medical students' empathy for
   patient care is important in medical education. Previous studies have
   shown associations between medical students' personality and empathy.
   This study aims to explore the associations between temperament and
   character and empathy for patient care in a sample of young medical
   students. Participants were 299 second-year Italian medical students.
   They completed the Italian versions of the Jefferson Scale of Empathy
   for medical students (JSE-S) and the Temperament and Character Inventory
   (TCI-140). Correlation and regression analyses were performed.
   Significant positive low correlations were found between empathy and
   Reward Dependence, Cooperativeness and Self-transcendence. The
   regression model of the sex and personality dimensions explained 14\% of
   the variance in empathy with two significant predictors: sex (B = 4.034)
   and Self-transcendence (B = 0.361). This study confirms that female
   medical students are more empathetic than males. It also suggests that
   the greater students' Self-transcendence is, the more empathetic towards
   patient care they are. Attention to medical students' personality should
   be present within medical curricula, as it may help to generate methods
   of enhancing and sustaining the empathy of students.}},

Title = {{Efficacy and safety of apixaban in patients with active malignancy and
   acute deep venous thrombosis}},
Journal = {{VASCULAR}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has been approved for
   treatment of deep venous thrombosis and venous thromboembolism which are
   associated with cancer. The efficacy and safety of apixaban in
   management of acute deep venous thrombosis associated with active
   malignancy is still an unresolved issue. The aim of our study is to
   evaluate the efficacy and safety of apixaban in patients with acute deep
   venous thrombosis and active malignancy compared with weight adjusted
   subcutaneous LMWH.
   Methods: Of 138 randomized patients, 100 patients with active malignancy
   presenting with acute deep venous thrombosis and still treated with
   chemotherapy were assigned to either oral apixaban therapy or
   subcutaneous low-molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin) through
   randomized clinical study in 1:1 ratio. All patients were followed up to
   six months. The primary end point was major bleeding, while secondary
   end points were recurrent deep venous thrombosis or venous
   thromboembolism, minor or non-fatal bleeding and mortality related to
   massive pulmonary embolism.
   Results: Both groups were matched regarding their baseline demographic,
   clinical and laboratory characteristics. We had 84 patients with
   metastatic cancer (stage 4). The most prevalent type of malignancy was
   cancer colon (42\% of cases). There was no significant difference
   between both groups regarding the incidence of primary and secondary end
   points. There were no reported mortality cases related to massive
   pulmonary embolism in both groups.
   Conclusion: In this limited study, there was no difference in the major
   bleeding, recurrent deep venous thrombosis or minor bleeding in patients
   with active malignancy when treated with either apixaban or LMWH.}},

Abstract = {{This work concern with the use of a novel mesquite gum as a biopolymer
   alternative in desert areas of northern Argentina. The species collected
   was taxonomically identified as Prosopis nigra based on
   morphological/histological characteristics. Its gummy exudate was
   partially purified (PN-biopolymer) showed antioxidant activity and good
   emulsifying properties. The emulsions at 10\% PN-biopolymer showed EI24
   values> 0.50 even after a thermal shock with a relatively high oil
   volume fraction of 50\%. pH-stability tests showed a correlation between
   fatty acid unsaturations and droplet size distribution. Then, the use of
   PN-biopolymer-alginate blend was evaluated for fish oil encapsulation.
   An external gelation process was optimized showed a significant
   dependence of the responses evaluated (EI24 and sphericity factor)
   towards the interaction between both polymers and the water/oil ratio.
   Thus, for a fixed oil/water ratio of 0.25, the appropriate amount of
   both polymers allowed to obtain an EI24 of 96.1\% with sphericity
   factors of 0.971. The PN-biopolymer played a key role in the orderly

   results, this biopolymer is a renewable, sustainable, and local resource
   for industrial applications.}},

Title = {{Development of biofuel from Nigella sativa biomass and its suitability
   for energy application}},
Journal = {{BIOMASS CONVERSION AND BIOREFINERY}},
Abstract = {{Nigella sativa is one such plant species indigenous to Middle-east,
   Eastern Europe, and the Asian Subcontinent. Black cumin seeds derived
   from N. sativa are one of the identified biomasses to produce biodiesels
   for the use in an unmodified CI engine. The current study aims to
   evaluate the credibility of Nigella sativa methyl ester (NSME) as a
   suitable blend alongside mineral diesel in a common rail direct
   Injection engine via fundamental combustion analysis. In the present
   work, 20\% of Nigella sativa methyl ester has been tested in diesel
   engine at 600 bar injection pressure under different pilot and main
   injection forms. The pilot injection mass has been varied from 5-15\%
   along with variation in main injection also. An optimized injection
   strategy has been found with respect to performance and emissions for
   effective implementation of EGR at 10\% and 20\% rate. At 5\% pilot
   injection, the NSME20 fuel showed comparable brake thermal efficiency
   and brake-specific fuel consumption at all engine loads. Furthermore,
   NOx emission of NSME20 fuel has been reduced by increasing the pilot
   injection rate when compared to diesel and this has been further reduced
   with 10-20\% exhaust gas recirculation. On the other hand, the
   combustion characteristics of NSME20 blend also shown similar pattern
   like diesel fuel with slight reduction in cylinder pressure and heat
   release rate. Finally, it has been concluded that the newly developed
   Nigella sativa methyl ester can be used as sustainable biofuel for
   various energy applications in the present scenario.
   Statement of novelty Novel biodiesel blend from Nigella sativa was
   investigated in modern CRDI engine and the results are compared with
   mineral diesel to maintain a proportionate engine performance with
   emission reduction.}},

Abstract = {{The understanding of amphiphilic block copolymers (ABC) in encapsulation
   and transport of inorganic nanomedicines is highly desired. Still, it
   remains limited due to the challenges in the fabrication of
   nanoassemblies (NAs) with highly-controlled shape and loading of
   nanoparticles. Herein, through growth regulation of luminescent gold
   nanoparticles (AuNPs) by different reductants with ABC pluronic F127 as
   a template, a straightforward strategy is reported for in-situ
   fabrication of three well-controlled gold NAs (AuNAs) that display
   tunable shapes from spherical to elongated nanostructures and
   controllable surface chemistry and loading of AuNPs with distinct
   emissions but identical individual AuNP size. The three AuNAs exhibit
   tailored in-vivo transport behaviours: those with spherical shape and

Abstract = {{Latanoprost has recently been used to treat alopecia as it causes an
   increase in the capillary density of patients. This work presents for
   the first time the development of polymeric nanocapsules containing
   latanoprost for the topical treatment of alopecia.
   Poly-epsilon-caprolactone nanocapsules loading latanoprost were
   developed by nanoprecipitation of the polymer on the surface of drug
   oily nanodroplets. The method encapsulated 93.9 +/- 0.4\% of the drug
   into nanocapsules of 197.8 (+/- 1.2) nm (PdI = 0.15 +/- 0.01). The
   nanosystem presented a zeta potential equal to - 30.1 +/- 1.8 mV and was
   stable for at least 90 days when stored at 6 degrees C. The colloidal
   aqueous dispersion was non-irritating, according to the in vitro HET-CAM
   test. The nanocapsules improved latanoprost accumulation into the hair
   follicles when topically applied on porcine skin, delivering 30\% more
   drug to these skin structures relative to the control solution (P <
   0.05). Also, with a simple manual massage, latanoprost accumulation was
   increased by twofold (P < 0.05). In conclusion, in addition to being a
   stable and safe formulation, nanocapsules enhanced latanoprost
   accumulation into the hair follicles, being a nanosystem with high
   potential for use as a topical formulation for the treatment of
   androgenic alopecia.}},

Title = {{Accuracy and Implications of Hemorrhagic Stroke Recognition by Emergency
   Medical Services}},
Journal = {{PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Hemorrhagic stroke is a medical emergency that requires rapid
   identification and treatment. Despite playing a critical role in the
   emergency response to hemorrhagic stroke patients, a minimal amount is
   known about the quality of emergency medical services (EMS) care for
   this condition. The objectives of this study were to quantify EMS
   hemorrhagic stroke recognition, identify predictors of accurate EMS
   recognition, and examine associations between EMS recognition, quality
   of prehospital care, and patient outcomes. Methods: Consecutive
   EMS-transported hemorrhagic strokes were identified from medical records
   at 4 primary stroke centers. Data regarding prehospital care were
   abstracted from EMS records and linked to in-hospital data. Clinical
   predictors of accurate EMS recognition were examined using logistic
   regression. EMS performance measure compliance and hospital outcomes
   were also compared among EMS recognized and unrecognized hemorrhagic
   strokes. Results: Over 24 months, EMS-transported 188 hemorrhagic stroke
   patients; 108 (57.4\%) were recognized by EMS. Recognized cases had
   higher rates of stroke scale documentation (84.3\% vs. 20.0\%, p <
   0.001); multivariable logistic regression confirmed a strong independent
   relationship between stroke scale documentation and recognition
   (adjusted OR 15.1 {[}5.6 to 40.7]). Recognized cases also had shorter
   on-scene times (15.5 vs. 21 min, p < 0.001) and door-to-computed
   tomography (DTCT) acquisition times (20 vs. 47 min, p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Among EMS-transported hemorrhagic stroke cases, stroke
   screen documentation was strongly associated with EMS stroke
   recognition, which was in turn associated with higher quality of EMS
   care and faster computed tomography (CT) scans upon emergency department
   arrival.}},

Abstract = {{Mycobionts of many lichen genera appear to demonstrate strong
   selectivity in the choice of algal partner. The biological properties of
   a photobiont and its availability in an environment significantly
   determine the habitat requirements of lichens. Flexibility in photobiont
   choice extends the ecological amplitude of lichens; therefore, it may
   constitute an important adaptive strategy for colonization of extreme
   habitats. The photobiont inventory of the three epigeic lichens most
   resistant to soil pollution, i.e., Cladonia cariosa, C. rei, and the
   hyperaccumulator Diploschistes muscorum, was examined to verify whether
   and to what extent algal composition depends on the type of habitat and
   substrate enrichment with heavy metals. Photobionts Asterochloris and
   Trebouxia were identified in the studied lichen species; however, the
   presence of Trebouxia was directly related to anthropogenic sites with
   technogenic substrates, and the proportion of lichen specimens with
   these algae clearly depended on the level of heavy-metal soil pollution
   and the habitat type. The total number of algal haplotypes increased
   with increasing soil pollution, and the richness was associated more
   with soil pollution than with a given lichen species. Additionally, a
   large number of lichen individuals bearing multiple algal genotypes at
   polluted sites were recorded. Although Cladonia lichens were previously
   thought to be restricted to Asterochloris, they are able to start the
   relichenization process with Trebouxia under specific habitat conditions
   and to establish a stable association with these algae when colonization
   of disturbed sites takes place. Comparative analysis of the internal
   transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA sequences revealed as many as 13
   haplotypes of Trebouxia, and phylogenetic analysis grouped them into two
   different clades. Such a high level of genetic diversity indicates that
   Trebouxia is well adapted to metal pollution and could be an alternative
   photosynthetic partner for certain lichens, especially in polluted
   sites.}},

Abstract = {{I re-examined published data for ontogenetic change in relative mass of
   the brain in six species of mammal (i.e., sheep, pig, cow, horse, rat,
   cat) to illustrate an insidious problem with conventional analyses of
   brain-body allometry. Graphical displays of logarithmic transformations
   of the original data for each species give the appearance of two
   discrete mathematical distributions, but untransformed observations
   nonetheless conform to a single distribution that is well described by a
   single, nonlinear equation. The concept of biphasic, allometric growth
   by the brain consequently is an artifact of transformation. The notion
   of Rapid and Slow phases in relative growth by the brain also is an
   artifact, because the notion is based explicitly on the concept of
   biphasic growth allometry. Relative growth by the brain in sheep, pigs,
   cows, and horses follows the path of a power curve with an exponent less
   than 1, so relative growth declines progressively as animals grow to
   their maximum size, at which point growth effectively ends for both
   brain and body. Relative growth by the brain in rats and cats follows
   the path of an exponential curve and consequently is more like relative
   growth by the brain of odontocoete cetaceans and primates, with the
   brain growing rapidly relative to the body early in ontogeny and
   attaining maximum (cats) or near-maximum (rats) mass well before the
   body reaches its maximum. An exponential pattern of relative growth by
   the brain appears to have evolved independently in rodents, carnivores,
   odontocoetes, and primates.}},

Abstract = {{The rumen is the hallmark organ of ruminants and hosts a diverse
   ecosystem of microorganisms that facilitates efficient digestion of
   plant fibers. We analyzed 897 transcriptomes from three Cetartiodactyla
   lineages: ruminants, camels and cetaceans, as well as data from ruminant
   comparative genomics and functional assays to explore the genetic basis
   of rumen functional innovations. We identified genes with relatively
   high expression in the rumen, of which many appeared to be recruited
   from other tissues. These genes show functional enrichment in ketone
   body metabolism, regulation of microbial community, and epithelium
   absorption, which are the most prominent biological processes involved
   in rumen innovations. Several modes of genetic change underlying rumen
   functional innovations were uncovered, including coding mutations, genes
   newly evolved, and changes of regulatory elements. We validated that the
   key ketogenesis rate-limiting gene (HMGCS2) with five ruminant-specific
   mutations was under positive selection and exhibits higher synthesis
   activity than those of other mammals. Two newly evolved genes (LYZ1 and
   DEFB1) are resistant to Gram-positive bacteria and thereby may regulate
   microbial community equilibrium. Furthermore, we confirmed that the
   changes of regulatory elements accounted for the majority of rumen gene
   recruitment. These results greatly improve our understanding of rumen
   evolution and organ evo-devo in general.}},

Abstract = {{Alongside the economic determinants and unobserved structural forces
   that drive migration flows, asylum migration faces additional natural
   and man-made hazards, which fall in the broad category of well-being.
   This paper estimates the effect of a composite well-being indicator on
   asylum migration flows, using a structural gravity equation. The paper
   starts by augmenting the gravity model to explain asylum flows with
   country-pair relative well-being, relocation costs and multilateral
   resistance. Taking the OECD Better Life Index as a starting point, we
   then combine data envelopment analysis and
   multi-criteria-decision-making to construct a multidimensional
   well-being indicator that groups 22 raw indicators into a single
   composite indicator with 10 consistently comparable dimensions across
   countries. Then, using a panel of bilateral asylum flows in OECD
   countries, we are able to obtain theoretically-grounded and consistent
   estimates. Results reveal that the composite indicator of well-being
   significantly explains asylum decisions and also show that certain
   dimensions of well-being act as push and pull determinants.}},

Title = {{Impact of a Ketogenic Diet on Sporadic Inclusion Body Myositis: A Case
   Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Sporadic inclusion body myositis (IBM) is a chronic inflammatory and
   degenerative muscle disease with limited treatment options; no therapy
   can alter its natural course. Ketogenic diets are theoretically capable
   of suppressing inflammation, enhancing cell bioenergetics, alleviating
   mitochondria dysfunction, and stimulating autophagy, which may be
   beneficial in IBM. We report the case of a 52-year-old woman with
   worsening IBM who pursued a modified ketogenic diet for 1 year. Adverse
   effects were mild and resolved 3 weeks into the diet. Prior to starting
   her ketogenic diet, despite the use of a walking stick at all times, she
   was experiencing one to two falls per week as well as swallowing
   difficulties, musculoskeletal pain, and depression. Moreover, magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) of the bilateral thighs during the year prior to
   the diet indicated worsening muscle inflammation and a 14\% decrease in
   thigh muscle volume, which corresponded to a 4\% decrease in the ratio
   of thigh muscle to thigh total volume. After 1 year on her ketogenic
   diet, our patient regained independent walking, and her swallowing
   difficulties, pain, and depression resolved. She maintained her
   strength, improved in every test of function, enhanced her quality of
   life, and lowered her blood creatine kinase. MRI of the bilateral thighs
   during the year of the diet indicated stabilized muscle inflammation and
   a 2.9\% decrease in thigh muscle volume, which in the context of
   diet-induced fat loss corresponded to a sustained 1\% increase in the
   ratio of thigh muscle to thigh total volume. This case is unique in that
   a ketogenic diet was utilized as the primary treatment strategy for a
   patient with confirmed IBM, culminating in substantial clinical
   improvement, stabilized muscle inflammation, and a slowed rate of muscle
   atrophy. Our patient has remained on her ketogenic diet for over 2 years
   now and continues to enjoy a full and independent life.}},

Title = {{Association between central retinal thickness and low luminance visual
   acuity in early age-related macular degeneration}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Purpose/Aim: To examine whether central retinal thickness (CRT) is
   related to mesopic visual acuity (VA) and low luminance deficit (LLD,
   difference between photopic and mesopic VA) in eyes with early and
   intermediate age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Materials and
   Methods: In a cross-sectional study, 50 pseudophakic subjects older than
   63 years were divided into three groups (no AMD, early AMD and
   intermediate AMD). Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT)
   was used to measure CRT in the 1 mm-central-area. Best-corrected
   distance VA was measured under photopic or mesopic luminance conditions
   and LLD calculated. Subjects were stratified by VA impairment to compare
   CRTs across these groups. Relationships were examined by stepwise
   multiple linear regression. Results: No significant differences in mean
   CRT, photopic and mesopic VA or LLD were detected between the groups no
   AMD, early AMD and intermediate AMD. However, mean CRTs were 20 microns
   and 18 microns thicker in the eyes with impaired mesopic VA (> 0.3
   logMAR) and impaired LLD (> 0.3 logMAR) compared to the eyes with
   non-impaired VA or LLD respectively (both p < 0.01). CRT and mesopic
   pupil size were independent predictors of mesopic VA (p = 0.001). CRT
   emerged as the only independent predictor of LLD (p = 0.004).
   Conclusions: Increased CRT was linked to worse retinal function when
   measured under mesopic conditions in eyes without AMD and eyes with
   early to intermediate AMD. SD-OCT imaging combined with VA measurements
   under low luminance conditions could be a useful tool to detect early
   AMD.}},

Abstract = {{Zusammenfassung
   Ziel der Studie Die Medikamentenadharenz von Menschen mit chronischen
   Erkrankungen ist haufig defizitar. Die vorliegende Studie untersuchte
   Forderfaktoren und Barrieren bezuglich der Umsetzung von arztlich
   verordneter Medikation bei Rehabilitanden mit kardiologischen
   Erkrankungen in der medizinischen Rehabilitation.
   Methodik Es wurden N=22 Rehabilitanden mit kardiologischen Erkrankungen
   in der medizinischen Rehabilitation mithilfe eines leitfadengestutzten
   Interviews befragt. Alle Interviews wurden digital aufgezeichnet und
   wortlich transkribiert. Die Analyse der Interviews erfolgte
   softwaregestutzt (MAXQDA 12) nach dem zusammenfassenden
   inhaltsanalytischen Ansatz von Mayring. Die Hauptkategorien
   (Barrieren/Forderfaktoren) wurden deduktiv und die Subkategorien
   induktiv entwickelt.
   Ergebnisse Insgesamt wurden 698 Textstellen in 22 Dokumenten codiert, im
   Durchschnitt 32 pro Interview (SD=13.2; Range 12-65). Die in der
   Hauptkategorie Barrieren vergebenen 370 Nennungen verteilen sich auf 13
   Subkategorien (u.a. Sorglosigkeit, Mangelnde Informiertheit, Vorbehalte,
   Belastungen, Vergesslichkeit). Die in der Hauptkategorie Forderfaktoren
   vergebenen 328 Aussagen konnten 14 Subkategorien zugeordnet werden (u.a.
   Individuelle Strategien, Informiertheit, Hilfsmittel,
   Behandlungseinsicht, Kommunikation).
   Schlussfolgerung Die Befunde legen nahe, dass eine mangelnde
   Medikamentenadharenz v.a. durch ein individualisiertes
   Barrierenmanagement, das auf mehreren Ebenen ansetzen muss, verbessert
   werden kann.
   Abstract
   Purpose The medication adherence of people with chronic diseases is
   often deficient. The present study investigated facilitators and
   barriers of the implementation of prescribed medication among
   rehabilitants with cardiological diseases in medical rehabilitation.
   Methods In total, 22 rehabilitants with cardiological diseases in
   medical rehabilitation were interviewed by means of a guided interview.
   All interviews were digitally recorded and literally translated. The
   analysis of the interviews was software-based (MAXQDA 12) according to
   the comprehensive content-analytic approach of Mayring. The main
   categories (barriers/facilitators) were deductively and the
   subcategories inductively developed.
   Results In total, 698 passages were coded in 22 documents, on average 32
   per interview (SD=13.2, range 12-65). The 370 entries in the main
   category barriers are divided into 13 subcategories (e.g. carelessness,
   lack of information, reservations, burdens, forgetfulness). The 328
   statements given in the main category facilitators could be allocated to
   14 subcategories (e.g. individual strategies, knowledge, aids, patient
   insight into the necessity of treatment, communication).
   Conclusion The findings suggest that a lack of medication adherence can
   be improved, in particular through individualized multi-level barrier
   management.}},

Abstract = {{Polymorphisms of genes involved in the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis have been associated
   with response to several antidepressant treatments in patients suffering
   of depression. These pharmacogenetics findings have been reported from
   independent cohorts of patients mostly treated with selective serotonin
   reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressant, and mirtazapine.
   Tianeptine, an atypical antidepressant, recently identified as a mu
   opioid receptor agonist, which prevents and reverses the stress induced
   by glucocorticoids, has been investigated in this present
   pharmacogenetics study. More than 3200 Caucasian outpatients with a
   major depressive episode (MDE) from real-life settings were herein
   analyzed for clinical response to tianeptine, a treatment initiated from
   79.5\% of the subjects, during 6-8 weeks follow-up, assessing
   polymorphisms targeting four genes involved in the HPA axis (NR3C1,
   FKPB5, CRHR1, and AVPR1B). We found a significant association (p<0.001)
   between CRHR1 gene variants rs878886 and rs16940665, or haplotype
   rs878886{*}C-rs16940665{*}T, and tianeptine antidepressant response and
   remission according to the hospital anxiety and depression scale.
   Analyses, including a structural equation model with simple mediation,
   suggest a moderate effect of sociodemographic characteristics and
   depressive disorder features on treatment response in individuals
   carrying the antidepressant responder allele rs8788861 (allele C). These
   findings suggest direct pharmacological consequences of CRHR1
   polymorphisms in the antidepressant tianeptine response and remission,
   in MDE patients. This study replicates the association of the CRHR1
   gene, involved in the HPA axis, with (1) a specificity attributed to
   treatment response, (2) a lower risk of chance finding, and in (3) an
   ecological situation.}},

Abstract = {{Software-defined networking (SDN) creates a platform to dynamically
   configure the networks for on-demand services. SDN can easily control
   the data plane and the control plane by implementing the decoupling

   virtual switches. SDN governs both data information and control
   information toward the destination based on flow label, but it does not
   contain security measure to restrict the malicious traffic. The
   malicious denial-of-service (DoS) attack traffic is generated inside the
   SDN environment; it leads to the service unavailability. This paper is
   mainly focused on the detection of DoS attacks and also mitigates the
   malicious traffic by dynamically configuring the firewall. The SDN with

   were investigated. The ion type of resin, pH of solution, contacting
   time, initial Cr (VI) concentration and adsorption temperature were
   studied which showing a great influence on the removal of Cr (VI).
   Consequently, the adsorption capacity could reach the maximum 197 mg/g
   under optimized conditions. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models were
   used to fit the equilibrium data at 298 K. The result demonstrated that
   the adsorption equilibrium could be well fitted by the Langmuir models.
   Besides the pseudo-first-order and second-order kinetics models were
   used to fit the adsorption kinetics, the adsorption behavior could be
   well fitted by the second-order kinetics model which indicated that the
   adsorption process was chemical adsorption. The thermodynamic parameters
   Delta H, Delta S and Delta G were calculated at 298 K. The negative
   Delta G and Delta H values indicated that the adsorption process of Cr
   (VI) removal by MR was spontaneous and endothermic. The results showed
   that MR could keep a stable adsorption capacity and magnetism.}},

   Loriinae Birds Associated With Clostridium perfringens Infection}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{A retrospective study revealed ten cases of emphysematous ingluvitis in
   Loriinae birds from two zoological collections between 2009 and 2020.
   Common clinical features were sudden death with gas distention of the
   crop, subcutaneous cervical emphysema and poor body condition, but also
   included collapse, hypothermia and abandonment. Macroscopic examination
   revealed moderate crop enlargement, distention and thickening with
   minimal intraluminal content, and moderate to severe submucosal to
   transmural gas-filled cysts (emphysema). Histopathology identified
   widespread transmural multifocal to coalescing empty pseudo-cystic
   cavities with lytic necrosis, pyo-/granulomatous inflammatory
   infiltrates, epithelial ulceration, parakeratotic hyperkeratosis,
   epithelial ballooning degeneration, and occasional intralesional
   rod-shaped bacteria. The lesion may have impaired the birds' ability to
   ingest food, resulting in suboptimal body condition. Necrotizing to
   granulomatous aspiration pneumonia was also a feature in some cases.
   Anaerobic bacterial culture of four crops identified Clostridium
   perfringens with associated toxin genes for alpha and occasionally beta2
   toxin (cpa and cpb2 genes respectively), by PCR analysis of bacterial
   isolates cultured from fresh or frozen tissue. C. perfringens was
   identified as the common etiological agent of emphysematous ingluvitis
   in crop and/or liver (six out of ten birds), and type A was confirmed in
   five birds. C. perfringens was not detected in the crop nor liver of two
   unaffected Loriinae birds. This is the first publication that
   characterizes nectarivorous bird emphysematous ingluvitis (NBEI),
   attributes C. perfringens as an etiological agent, and highlights this
   novel disease as an important cause of death in Loriinae birds,
   particularly in nestling and fledgling stage of development, but also in
   older lorikeets and lories.}},

Abstract = {{In 1850, a small group of liberal reformers and business partners in
   Stockholm launched a magazine entitled Tidskrift for praktisk
   byggnadskonst och mekanik m.m. {[}The Journal for Practical Art of
   Building and Mechanics etc.], the first architectural magazine in
   Sweden. This article situates the magazine in its historical context.
   Through a close reading of published articles and editorial
   correspondence, it explores the magazine's main objectives. It argues
   that this shortlived magazine was used as a tool for implementing
   comprehensive architectural and societal reforms. Above all, the
   magazine served as a laboratory for creating a new Swedish architectural
   style. Since this new architectural style was originally envisioned to
   be used by white Europeans all over the world, the transnational network
   of architectural magazines played a crucial role in the highly ambitious
   endeavour of its founders. This article shows how a national
   architectural style was conceptualised as an exportable commodity in mid
   nineteenth-century Scandinavia. In so doing, it further illuminates
   architectural magazines as agents and mergers of highly ambitious
   aesthetic, commercial, and patriotic aims.}},

   novel flow-path architecture}},
Journal = {{APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{180}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{A novel heat exchanger architecture was investigated, in which each
   fluid pathway transitions through the heat exchanger from tube-flow to
   shell-flow, or from shell-flow to tube-flow. The heat exchangers (HX)
   consisted of two plenums filled with tube bundles and a solid core of
   Counterflow channels Sandwiched between Plenums (CSP). To allow a high
   packing in the core region, a non-circular, e.g., triangular,
   cross-section tube shape was employed. In this exploratory study of the
   proposed CSP HXs, prototypes were fabricated by Laser Powder Bed Fusion
   additive manufacturing. Several challenges posed by the laser-powder-bed
   fabrication were presented and design solutions for additive
   manufacturing were discussed. Two different CSP HX were 3D printed, one
   in which the core region was placed midway between the end plates in the
   HX, and another one in which the core region was offset toward one end
   of the HX. The performance of the CSP HXs was evaluated against an
   off-the-shelf 5 kW shell-and-tube heat exchanger, considered as the
   baseline heat exchanger. Each of the baseline HX and six CSP HXs
   configurations were tested at three different flow rates for R245fa
   (cold fluid) while inlet conditions for the water (hot fluid) were not
   changed, for a total of 21 tests. It was found that the heat load for
   three CSP HXs configurations shows excellent thermal performance as
   compared to that of the baseline HX. The overall heat transfer
   coefficient for two CSP HX configurations was higher than that of the
   baseline by 16 to 32\%. Although the proposed HXs did not outperform the
   commercial baseline HX in all aspects, the reported thermohydraulic
   performance in this first embodiment of the proposed HX concept
   indicated that the CSP concept offers a new path towards more efficient
   and more compact heat exchangers.}},

   with-NO2 as one of the substitution group show higher nonlinear

   absorption in the compounds has been attributed to two-step two-photon
   absorption process. We have shown that the energy bands of these
   compounds are distributed such that for excitation at 532 nm they have
   strong nonlinear absorption. These properties of the reported compounds

Abstract = {{Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) Middle East Asia
   Minor 1 is one of the most important pests of the common bean, due to
   its potential of causing direct and indirect damage. This study aimed to
   evaluate 78 bean genotypes to verify the occurrence of resistance of
   antixenosis type against B. tabaci. Initially, multiple-choice trials
   were performed to evaluate the oviposition preference and nymphs'
   establishment at 3 and 15 days after infestation. Subsequently, 21 bean
   genotypes were selected, and a no-choice test was conducted.
   Colorimetric analyses were performed to establish correlations between
   leaf color and insect establishment. In multiple-choice trial, the
   genotypes BRS Ametista, BRS Estilo, BRS Esplendor, SCS 204 Predileto,
   BRS Notavel, IPR Eldorado, CHIB 06, IPR Quero-Quero, Iapar 81, CHIP 338,

   CHIP 348, Carioca Comum, CHIP 300, IAC Carioca Ete, IAC Ybate, and
   Tybata were the least used for oviposition and nymph establishment,
   demonstrating antixenosis or antibiosis. In the no-choice trial, most
   genotypes were less attractive to whitefly, and the genotypes CHIB 06,
   IPR Garca, CHIP 300, and IAC Esperanca had less oviposition. The most
   attractive genotypes presented high luminosity and more intense green
   and yellow colors, indicating positive correlation. Therefore, the
   genotypes BRS Ametista, SCS 204 Predileto, BRS Estilo, IPR Eldorado,
   SCS-202 Guara, Carioca Comum, Arcelina 4, CHIP 348, and IAC Esperanca
   showed the highest resistance stability in the no-choice trial, and they
   are promising sources of antixenotic factors for use in breeding
   programs to obtain whitefly-resistant common bean lines.}},

   basis of the underlying quantum chemical characteristics of small
   molecules. However, it is difficult to learn higher level chemical
   properties from lower level quantum calculations. To overcome this
   challenge, we pretrained deep learning models to compute quantum
   chemical properties and then reused the intermediate representations
   constructed by the pretrained network. Transfer learning, in this way,
   substantially outperformed models based on chemical graphs alone or
   quantum chemical properties alone. This result was robust, observable in
   five prediction tasks: identifying sites of epoxidation by metabolic
   enzymes and identifying sites of covalent reactivity with cyanide,
   glutathione, DNA and protein. We see that this approach may
   substantially improve the accuracy of deep learning models for specific
   chemical structures, such as aromatic systems.}},

Title = {{A collaborative care psychosocial intervention to improve late life
   depression in socioeconomically deprived areas of Guarulhos, Brazil: the
   PROACTIVE cluster randomised controlled trial protocol}},
Journal = {{TRIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Background: The elderly population has been growing in most low- and
   middle-income countries (LMIC), and depression is a common condition
   among these populations. The lack of integration between mental health
   and primary healthcare services and the shortage of mental health
   specialists in the public health system contribute to underdiagnosis and
   undertreatment of depression. One of the strategies to reduce this gap
   is task shifting and collaborative care treatments. This study therefore
   aims to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a
   collaborative care psychosocial intervention to improve the clinical
   management of depression among elderly people in poor neighbourhoods in
   Guarulhos, Brazil.
   Methods: Two-arm, cluster randomised controlled trial with Basic Health
   Units as the clusters and a 1:1 allocation ratio. Twenty Basic Health
   Units have been randomly selected and randomised to control or
   intervention arms. We aim to recruit 1440 adults (72 per cluster) aged
   60 years or over identified with depression (9-item Patient Health
   Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score >= 10). The control arm participants will
   receive an enhanced usual care, while the intervention arm participants
   will receive an enhanced usual care and a 17-week psychosocial
   intervention programme delivered at home by community health workers
   with the help of an application installed on tablet computers. The
   primary outcome is the proportion with depression recovery (PHQ-9 < 10)
   at 8 months' follow-up. We will also assess the maintenance of any
   earlier clinical gains and the cost-effectiveness of the intervention at
   12 months.
   Discussion: This is the first randomised trial to investigate a
   collaborative care intervention to treat depression among poor elderly
   in LMIC/Latin America. This is a major public health problem worldwide,
   but in these countries, there are no locally tested, evidence-based
   interventions available to date.}},

Abstract = {{The long-term impact on creep, drying shrinkage, and permeation
   characteristics of an innovative concrete produced with manufactured
   geopolymer coarse aggregate (GPA) has been investigated and compared
   with quarried Basalt aggregate concrete. Microstructure and
   pore-structure development up to 1 year were examined through scanning
   electron microscopy, nanoindentation, and X-ray computed tomography.
   Compressive strength and elastic modulus of GPA concrete varied from
   34.6 to 50.8 and 18.5 to 20.5 GPa, respectively, between 28 and 365
   days. The 1-year creep strain of GPA concrete was 747 microstrain while
   the calculated creep coefficient was 0.97, which is significantly lower
   than the creep coefficient predicted by AS 3600 and CEB-FIP models.
   Moreover, the 365-day drying shrinkage is 570 microstrain, which is also
   lower than the maximum permissible limit specified by AS3600. The GPA
   concrete displayed high water absorption, but lower air and water
   permeability compared to Basalt aggregate concrete. This is attributed
   to a porous surface layer with large number of capillaries increasing
   the water absorption of GPA concrete through capillary suction. The
   discontinuity in the pore network coupled with a condensed interfacial
   transition zone formed in GPA concrete could be the reason for lower
   permeability. Overall, the long-term performance of the GPA demonstrates
   a potential as a lightweight coarse aggregate for concrete, with the
   added advantage of reducing the environmental impact utilizing fly ash
   from coal-fired power generation.}},

Volume = {{886}},

Abstract = {{Lung cancer has a relatively poor prognosis, and the clinical efficacy
   of targeted drugs remains unsatisfactory. Therefore, the search for safe
   and efficient novel antitumor drugs has become an urgent problem in the
   treatment of lung cancer. Aloe-emodin (AE), a medicinal herb, has been
   demonstrated to exhibit many pharmacological effects on tumor cells,
   such as lung cancer cells. However, the anticancer properties of AE have
   not been fully exploited by modern medicine, as their mechanisms of
   action are not yet known. In this study, the bioassay results
   demonstrated that AE reduced the viability of the non-small cell lung
   cancer cell line A549 and NCI-H1299 in a dose- and time-dependent
   manner. Moreover, AE induced caspase-dependent apoptosis and autophagy.
   AE induced autophagy through activation of MAPK signaling and inhibition
   of the Akt/mTOR pathway. We also found that AE-induced autophagy was
   attenuated by the reactive oxygen species scavenger Nacetylcysteine,
   indicating that reactive oxygen species played a key role in AE-mediated
   autophagy in A549 and NCI-H1299 cells. Furthermore, AE induced reactive
   oxygen species-dependent autophagy in A549 and NCI-H1299 cells, which
   triggered apoptosis. Additionally, AE showed synergistic cytotoxic
   effects with the antitumor drug gemcitabine in A549 and NCI-H1299 cells.
   In brief, these results showed that AE might be useful for developing a
   therapeutic candidate for lung cancer complications.}},

Abstract = {{6-Thioguanine (6-TG) drug is commonly used for the treatment of
   inflammatory bowel disease, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, Crohn's
   disease, and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. However, a high
   dose of 6-TG may cause severe side effects, including bone marrow
   depression and gastrointestinal complications. Two-dimensional
   nanomaterials have attracted the attention of researchers as chemical
   sensors for different biological molecules. Here, density functional
   theory calculations were performed to explore the interaction properties
   of 6-TG with a silicon carbide monolayer (SiCM) as well as noble metal
   (Au)-decorated SiCM (Au@SiCM) to elaborate on their potential
   application as electronic sensors. The sensing response of the SiCM to
   the 6-TG drug is very small (similar to 3.9 at 298 K) because of a weak
   interaction with adsorption energy and charge transfer of - 0.15 eV and
   0.03 |e|, respectively. An Au atom was preferentially adsorbed above a
   Si-C bond of the SiCM, releasing the energy of 3.79 eV. By the Au
   decoration, the 6-TG was strongly adsorbed onto the Au@SiCM with
   adsorption energy of - 0.79 eV and the sensing response increased to
   384.0. The recovery time for the 6-TG desorption from the Au@SiCM
   surface was obtained to be 2.3 s. Consequently, the Au@SiCM can
   transform the existence of 6-TG molecules into electrical signals and it
   may potentially be applied as an electronic sensor for the recognition
   of the 6-TG drug.}},

Title = {{Hepatic-Specific Decrease in the Expression of Selenoenzymes and Factors
   Essential for Selenium Processing After Endotoxemia}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Selenium (Se) levels decrease in the circulation during acute
   inflammatory states and sepsis, and are inversely associated with
   morbidity and mortality. A more specific understanding of where
   selenoproteins and Se processing are compromised during insult is
   needed. We investigated the acute signaling response in selenoenzymes
   and Se processing machinery in multiple organs after innate immune
   activation in response to systemic lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
   Methods
   Wild type (WT) adult male C57/B6 mice were exposed to LPS (5 mg/kg,
   intraperitoneal). Blood, liver, lung, kidney and spleen were collected
   from control mice as well as 2, 4, 8, and 24 h after LPS. Plasma Se
   concentration was determined by ICP-MS. Liver, lung, kidney and spleen
   were evaluated for mRNA and protein content of selenoenzymes and
   proteins required to process Se.
   Results
   After 8 h of endotoxemia, plasma levels of Se and the Se transporter
   protein, SELENOP were significantly decreased. Consistent with this
   timing, the transcription and protein content of several hepatic
   selenoenzymes, including SELENOP, glutathione peroxidase 1 and 4 were
   significantly decreased. Furthermore, hepatic transcription and protein
   content of factors required for the Se processing, including
   selenophosphate synthetase 2 (Sps2), phosphoseryl tRNA kinase (Pstk),
   selenocysteine synthase (SepsecS), and selenocysteine lyase (Scly) were
   significantly decreased. Significant LPS-induced downregulation of these
   key selenium processing enzymes was observed in isolated hepatocytes. In
   contrast to the acute and dynamic changes observed in the liver,
   selenoenzymes did not decrease in the lung, kidney or spleen.
   Conclusion
   Hepatic selenoenzyme production and Se processing factors decreased
   after endotoxemia. This was temporally associated with decreased
   circulating Se. In contrast to these active changes in the regulation of
   Se processing in the liver, selenoenzymes did not decrease in the lung,
   kidney or spleen. These findings highlight the need to further study the
   impact of innate immune challenges on Se processing in the liver and the
   impact of targeted therapeutic Se replacement strategies during innate
   immune challenge.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years outbreaks of vector-borne diseases have caused great
   concern to the population, especially those diseases transmitted by
   mosquitoes. Repellents appear as an affordable alternative for
   prevention, making it increasingly important to control the quality of
   these products, since the content of the active ingredients are directly
   related to the efficiency and the protection time provided by the
   repellent. This paper proposes an analytical method for determining the
   DEET (N, N- Diethyl-3-methylbenzamide) content in insect repellents in
   lotion using UV spectroscopy. For this propose five different strategies
   of regression were evaluated: (a) Partial Least Squares (PLS) using
   full-spectrum: (b) interval PLS (iPLS); Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
   with variable selection by the (c) Genetic Algorithm (MLR/GA), (d)
   Successive Projections Algorithm (MLR/SPA) and the (e) Stepwise
   (MLR/SW). Appropriate predictions were obtained with RMSEP values
   between 0.88 and 0.93\%w w(-1). No systematic error was observed and no
   significant differences were found between the predicted and reference
   values, according to a paired t-test at 95\% confidence level. The
   results demonstrated the potential of UV spectroscopy associated to
   multivariate calibration to determine DEET content in repellents as a
   fast, simple strategy and with a suitable correlation between the values
   estimated by the model and the reference values. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Cytokine activation of cells induces gene networks involved in
   inflammation and immunity. Transient gene activation can have a lasting
   effect even in the absence of ongoing transcription, known as long-term
   transcriptional memory. Here we explore the nature of the establishment
   and maintenance of interferon gamma (IFN gamma)-induced priming of human
   cells. We find that, although ongoing transcription and local chromatin
   signatures are short-lived, the IFN gamma-primed state stably propagates
   through at least 14 cell division cycles. Single-cell analysis reveals
   that memory is manifested by an increased probability of primed cells to
   engage in target gene expression, correlating with the strength of
   initial gene activation. Further, we find that strongly memorized genes
   tend to reside in genomic clusters and that long-term memory of these
   genes is locally restricted by cohesin. We define the duration,
   stochastic nature, and molecular mechanisms of IFN gamma-induced
   transcriptional memory, relevant to understanding enhanced innate immune
   signaling.}},

Title = {{A new perspective on the toxicity of arsenic-contaminated soil: Tandem
   mass tag proteomics and metabolomics in earthworms}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{398}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{The toxicity of low-level arsenic (As)-contaminated soil is not well
   understood. An integrated proteomic and metabolomic approach combined
   with morphological examination was used to investigate the potential
   biological toxicity of As-contaminated soil based on an exposure
   experiment with the earthworm Eisenia fetida. The results showed that
   the earthworm hindgut accumulated high As concentrations resulting in
   injury to the intestinal epithelia, chloragogenous tissues and coelom
   tissues. Furthermore, As-contaminated soil induced a significant
   increase in betaine levels and a decrease in dimethylglycine and
   myo-inositol levels in the earthworms, suggesting that the
   osmoregulatory metabolism of the earthworms may have been disturbed. The
   significantly altered levels of asparagine and dimethylglycine were
   proposed as potential biomarkers of As-contaminated soil. The
   upregulation of soluble calcium-binding proteins and profilin, the
   downregulation of sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase, and the proteins
   changes identified by gene ontology enrichment analysis confirmed that
   the earthworms suffered from osmotic stress. In addition, the
   significant changes in glycine-tRNA ligase activity and coelomic tissue
   injury revealed that As accumulation may disturb the earthworm immune
   system. This work provided new insight into the proteomic and metabolic
   toxicity of low-level As-contaminated soil ecosystems in earthworms,
   extended our knowledge of dual omics and highlighted the mechanisms
   underlying toxicity.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene oxide (GO)/epoxy nanocomposites are prepared by means of the
   phase extraction method. FTIR and XPS characterizations have confirmed
   the charge transfer between GO and epoxy that promotes the uniform
   dispersion and exfoliation of GO. The effects of GO sheets on the curing
   reaction and interfacial bonding are investigated and correlated with
   mechanical properties of epoxy nanocomposites. The results show that the
   GO sheets have a facilitation effect on the curing reaction of epoxy
   resin, in which the oxygen groups of GO covalently react with epoxy
   matrix and establish chemical interfacial bonding in epoxy
   nanocomposites. Therefore, the mechanical properties of nanocomposites
   are enhanced, showing the highest tensile strength of 88.1 +/- 2.5 MPa,
   flexural strength of 134.2 +/- 6.1 MPa and flexural modulus of 3.15 +/-
   0.11 GPa, respectively. However, GO sheets could simultaneously
   physically restrict the curing reactivity and reduce the cross-link
   density in the interface, which results in weakened interfacial property
   of nanocomposites, especially at high loading. Thus, the reinforcing
   effect of GO sheets is reduced and the mechanical properties of GO/epoxy
   nanocomposites decline at relatively higher loading.

   Source Characteristics: Tracing the Origin of SOs in the Environment}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{398}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Despite growing concerns regarding plastic additives, their
   environmental fate coupled with leaching from source materials are not
   well known. Styrene oligomers (SOs), which are unintended additives in
   expanded polystyrene (EPS), are estrogenic micropollutants. Here, we
   identified the effects of their potential sources (i.e., EPS buoy and
   its leachate) and environmental dilution on SO distribution within
   coastal sediments. SO content in fresh EPS particles was 0.1\% (w/w),
   dominated by 2,4,6-triphenyl-hexene (ST-1), while 2,4-diphenyl-1-butene
   (SD-2) accounted for most of the SOs in EPS leachate, indicating its
   faster leachability. In lake and offshore environments, the SO
   composition profiles from their terrestrial inputs and inner sites were
   similar to those of EPS leachate; meanwhile, the exponentially
   decreasing SO concentration and increasing styrene trimers (STs)
   fraction with distance from the inner to outer sites were evident. These
   profiles indicated continuous SO leaching from their potential sources
   in the inland, followed by a change in SOs due to environmental
   dilution. SOs in beach sediment implied the presence of micro-sized EPS
   particles. We suggest the ST-1 to SD-2 ratio as an index to
   differentiate among freshly leached SOs (-0.02), environmentally diluted
   SOs after leaching (-0.1), SOs in fresh EPS (-1.2), and SOs in aged EPS
   (> 2).}},

Title = {{Changes of Phenotypic Pattern in Functional Movement Disorders: A
   Prospective Cohort Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Functional movement disorders (FMD) refer to a group of
   movement disorders that present with clinical characteristics
   incongruent to those due to established pathophysiologic processes, as
   for example in the case of neurodegeneration or lesions. The aim of this
   study was to assess clinical features that contribute to the specific
   phenotypic presentations and disease course of FMD.
   Methods: The study consisted of 100 patients with FMD treated at Clinic
   for Neurology, Clinical Center of Serbia, who were longitudinally
   observed. Comprehensive clinical and psychiatric assessment was
   performed at the baseline, when initial FMD phenotype was defined.
   Follow-up assessment of phenotypic pattern over the time and clinical
   course was done after 3.2 +/- 2.5 years at average.
   Results: We showed that 48\% of FMD patients were prone to changes of
   phenotypic pattern during the disease course. Dystonia had tendency to
   remains as single and unchanged phenotype over the time (68.2\%), while
   patients initially presented with Tremor, Gait disorder, Parkinsonism
   and Mixed phenotype were more susceptible to developing additional
   symptoms (62.5, 50, and 100\%, respectively). Higher levels of
   somatoform experiences (p = 0.033, Exp(B) = 1.082) and higher motor
   severity (p = 0.040, Exp(B) = 1.082) at baseline assessment were
   associated with an increased likelihood of further enriching of FMD
   phenotype with additional functional symptoms. Also, these patients more
   frequently reported pain, and had higher scores on majority of applied
   psychiatric scales, together with more frequent presence of major
   depressive disorder.
   Conclusion: Results from this prospective study suggested tendency for
   progression and enrichment of functional symptoms in FMD patients over
   time. Besides functional core symptoms, other key psychological and
   physical features (like pain or multiple somatisations) were quite
   relevant for chronicity and significant dysability of FMD patients.}},

Title = {{Impact of green synthesized WcAgNPs on in-vitro plant regeneration and

Abstract = {{Key message Withania coagulans(L.) Dunal bio-synthesized silver
   nanoparticles (WcAgNPs) worked as an abiotic elicitor or auto-catalyst
   that enhanced root regeneration and withanolides production in in-vitro
   regeneratedW. coagulans. Rapid development in the production /
   consumption of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) raised serious concern over
   its effects on the growth of natural plant community. The knowledge
   related to impact of AgNPs on plant growth and biocompatibility is
   increasing day by day, but comprehensive mechanism and gaps regarding
   their impacts on plant health have yet to be addressed. In the present
   study, we investigated the impact of Withania coagulans biosynthesized
   AgNPs (WcAgNPs) on in-vitro plant growth and withanolides production.
   Obtained results showed that the low concentrations of WcAgNPs
   significantly induced the plant growth by regulating oxidative stress
   via anti-oxidative defense system. Physiological, morphology and
   anatomical features also reflected healthy plant growth under low
   WcAgNPs exposure. While higher concentrations of WcAgNPs have a negative
   impact on W. coagulans plant growth due to induced lipid peroxidation,
   ROS accumulation, and root cell death. At lower concentrations, WcAgNPs
   have shown a positive effect on in-planta withanolides biosynthesis
   stimulating withanolide A and withaferin A up to 11.15-22.8-fold,
   respectively. Furthermore, the expression of withanolides biosynthetic
   genes were also quantified upon WcAgNPs exposure and terpenes
   biosynthetic genes showed over-expression. Thus, the present study
   concludes that the lower concentrations of WcAgNPs positively induced
   plant growth via improved root organogenesis and also have potential to
   act as an elicitor for withanolides production.}},

Title = {{The impact of nuclear shape on the emergence of the neutron dripline}},
Journal = {{NATURE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{587}},

Pages = {{66+}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Atomic nuclei are composed of a certain number of protons Z and neutrons
   N. A natural question is how large Z and N can be. The study of
   superheavy elements explores the large Z limit(1,2), and we are still
   looking for a comprehensive theoretical explanation of the largest
   possible N for a given Z-the existence limit for the neutron-rich
   isotopes of a given atomic species, known as the neutron dripline(3).
   The neutron dripline of oxygen (Z = 8) can be understood theoretically
   as the result of single nucleons filling single-particle orbits confined
   by a mean potential, and experiments confirm this interpretation.
   However, recent experiments on heavier elements are at odds with this
   description. Here we show that the neutron dripline from fluorine (Z =
   9) to magnesium (Z = 12) can be predicted using a mechanism that goes
   beyond the single-particle picture: as the number of neutrons increases,
   the nuclear shape assumes an increasingly ellipsoidal deformation,
   leading to a higher binding energy. The saturation of this effect (when
   the nucleus cannot be further deformed) yields the neutron dripline:
   beyond this maximum N, the isotope is unbound and further neutrons
   `drip' out when added. Our calculations are based on a recently
   developed effective nucleon-nucleon interaction(4), for which
   large-scale eigenvalue problems are solved using
   configuration-interaction simulations. The results obtained show good
   agreement with experiments, even for excitation energies of low-lying
   states, up to the nucleus of magnesium-40 (which has 28 neutrons). The
   proposed mechanism for the formation of the neutron dripline has the
   potential to stimulate further thinking in the field towards explaining
   nucleosynthesis with neutron-rich nuclei.
   A mechanistic explanation for the origin of the neutron dripline shows
   that nuclei accommodate the addition of neutrons by becoming
   increasingly ellipsoidal, up to a maximum number of neutrons,
   reconciling theory and experiments.}},

Abstract = {{In the gas phase, potential energy surfaces can be used to provide
   insight into the details of photochemical reaction dynamics. In
   solution, however, it is unclear what potential energy surfaces, if any,
   can be used to describe even simple chemical reactions such as the
   photodissociation of a diatomic solute. In this paper, we use mixed
   quantum/classical (MQC) molecular dynamics (MD) to study the
   photodissociation of Na-2(+) in both liquid Ar and liquid
   tetrahydrofuran (THF). We examine both the gas-phase potential surfaces
   and potentials of mean force (PMF), which assume that the solvent
   remains at equilibrium with the solute throughout the photodissociation
   process and show that neither resemble a nonequilibrium dynamical energy
   surface that is generated by taking the time integral of work. For the
   photodissociation of Na-2(+) in liquid Ar, the dynamical energy surface
   shows clear signatures of solvent caging, and the degree of caging is
   directly related to the mass of the solvent atoms. For Na-2(+) in liquid
   THF, local specific interactions between the solute and solvent lead to
   changes in chemical identity that create a kinetic trap that effectively
   prevents the molecule from dissociating. The results show that
   nonequilibrium effects play an important role even in simple
   solution-phase reactions, requiring the use of dynamical energy surface
   to understand such chemical events.}},

Abstract = {{Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common progressive
   neurodegenerative disease, which is characterized by the loss of
   dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Iron
   deposit was found in the SNpc of PD patients and animal models, however,
   the mechanisms involved in disturbed iron metabolism remain unknown.
   Identifying the relationship between iron metabolism and PD is important
   for finding new therapeutic strategies. In this study, we found that
   transgenic over-expression (OE) of Drosophila mitoferrin (dmfrn) or
   knockdown of Fer3HCH significantly mitigated the reduced mitochondrial
   aconitase activity, abnormal wing posture, flight deficits and
   mitochondrial morphology defects associated with PINK1 loss-of-function
   (LOF). Further work demonstrated that dmfrn OE or Fer3HCH knockdown
   significantly rescued the impaired mitochondrial respiration in PINK1
   LOF flies, indicating that dmfrn or Fer3HCH may rescue PINK1 LOF
   phenotypes through elevating mitochondrial bioavailable iron levels to

Title = {{Benign oxidation of PVA for configuration of reversible polyketal
   networks}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN POLYMER JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{140}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is a reactive polymer since there are abundant
   hydroxyl groups so various chemical transitions are feasible for PVA. In
   this study, we utilized the oxidation of PVA followed with a
   ketalization to achieve the configuration of reversible polyketal
   networks. The oxidation of PVA was performed by using a benign oxidation
   system in which hydrogen peroxide acts as the green oxidant and
   p-toluene sulfonic acid (TSA) as the catalyst. Both fully oxidized PVA
   (polyketone, PK) and partially oxidized PVA (PVA-OXI) were obtained by
   controlling the oxidation time. Polyketals (PKLs) were prepared by
   ketalization of PVA with PK, or by self-ketalization of PVA-OXI. Under
   the catalysis TSA, only dark PKLs were obtained. However, with ionic
   liquid {[}BMIm]HSO4 as the catalyst, PKLs were colorless and
   transparent. The PKLs originated from a feed ratio of PVA/PK = 4/1 (w/w)
   seems tougher than other samples. When the PKL films were hydrolysed at
   90 degrees C and recasted, the recycled (or reprocessed) PKL films
   appears the same as the fresh one, from the appearance to the chemical
   structure, and further to the mechanical properties. PKLs can be
   prepared by self-ketalization as well from PVA-OXI but the mechanical
   properties of the obtained PKLs seem not as good as those from
   ketalization of PVA and PK. The discoveries in this work open a door to
   easy but efficient modification of OH-abundant polymers, especially for
   polysaccharides.}},

Abstract = {{Long non-coding RNAs are novel regulators in neuropathic pain. In this
   study, we aimed to explore the role and the mechanism of lncRNA FIRRE in
   regulating the secretion of microglial cells-derived proinflammatory
   cytokines in neuropathic pain. The female mouse model of neuropathic
   pain was established by bilateral chronic constriction injury (CCI)
   surgery. The mouse primary microglial cells were induced by
   lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The interaction between FIRRE and high
   mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) was assessed by RNA immunoprecipitation,
   RNA pull-down, and ubiquitination assays. FIRRE expression was
   upregulated in the spinal cord tissue of female CCI mice and LPS-induced
   microglial cells. The concentrations of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6
   from LPS-induced microglial cells were reduced by FIRRE knockdown. FIRRE
   bound to HMGB1 and negatively regulated its protein level. The
   ubiquitination degradation of HMGB1 was promoted by FIRRE silence. The
   HMGB1 over-expression reversed the inhibitory effect of FIRRE silence on
   the secretion of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 from LPS-induced
   microglial cells. The in vivo experiment showed that FIRRE knockdown
   alleviated neuropathic pain of CCI female mice. Our findings indicated
   that lncRNA FIRRE downregulation inhibits the secretion of microglial
   cells-derived proinflammatory cytokines by decreasing HMGB1 expression,
   thereby relieving neuropathic pain of female mice.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Choose Health: Food, Fun, and Fitness (CHFFF) is aimed at 3rd
   to 6th graders, and uses experiential learning, food preparation, active
   games, goal setting, and a family newsletter to target behaviors shown
   to decrease childhood obesity and chronic disease risk. This study aimed
   to evaluate CHFFF as intended in low-income settings.
   METHODS A quasi-experimental design with delayed intervention was used.
   CHFFF participants in 27 after-school and 28 in-school groups in 5 New
   York counties in 2014 to 2015 completed a self-report survey at initial
   enrollment, after a no-intervention control period, and after receiving
   CHFFF. Statistical analyses were based on 561 3rd to 6th graders who
   completed all 3 surveys and participated in at least 4 of the 6 lessons.
   RESULTS Compared to their control period, after receiving CHFFF, youth
   significantly improved in the following multi-item dietary scores:
   overall dietary intake (p < .001), vegetable intake (p < .001), fruit
   intake (p < .01), soda/fast food intake (p < .05) and intent to consume
   soda/fast food (p < .001). Youth also reported reading Nutrition Facts
   labels and sharing about healthy eating with their family more often
   (both p < .001), and greater likelihood of having tried a new food (p <
   .001).
   CONCLUSIONS Results provide evidence for the effectiveness of this
   curriculum in improving self-reported child diet and related behaviors.}},

   ceramics, which are bismuth-layered perovskite ferroelectrics, were
   synthesized through the solid-state reaction method. The effects of
   different sintering temperatures and V2O5 contents on the structure of
   the microstructure, Raman spectrum, and dielectric properties of the
   SBTV ceramics were investigated. As sintered at high temperature
   (980-1040 degrees C) and different V2O5 contents (x = 0.1 - x = 0.4),
   only disk-like grains of the SBTV ceramics were observed in the scanning
   electron micrographs. Preferential orientation of the crystals of the
   SBTV ceramics was confirmed through X- ray diffraction studies. The
   higher dielectric constant and Curie temperature of the SBTV ceramics
   compared with those of strontium bismuth tantalite (SrBi2Ta2O9, SBT)
   ceramics are ascribe to the partial replace of Ta5+ ions by V5+ ions in
   the B sites. The Curie-Weiss law and the modified Curie-Weiss law were
   used to discuss the normal-type or relaxor-type ferroelectric
   characteristic of the SBTV ceramics. The Ta5+ ion replaced by V5+ ion
   site in SBT ceramics to form SBTV ceramics exerted a pronounced effect
   on the -BO6 mode, as demonstrated by Raman spectrum results.}},

Abstract = {{Methotrexate (MTX) has been widely used for the treatment of many types
   of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and
   dermatomyositis. However, its pharmacological mechanism is still unclear
   completely. In this study, we found that MTX is a potent and selective
   inhibitor of the Kv1.3 channel, a class of potassium channels highly
   associated with autoimmune diseases. Electrophysiological experiments
   showed that MTX inhibited human Kv1.3 channel with an IC50 of 41.5 +/-
   24.9 nM, and 1 mu M MTX inhibited 32.6 +/- 1.3\% and 25.6 +/- 2.2\% of
   human Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 channel currents, respectively. These data implied
   the unique selectivity of MTX towards the Kv1.3 channel. Excitingly,
   using channel activation and chimeric experiments, we found that MTX
   bound to the outer pore region of Kv1.3 channel. Mutagenesis experiments
   in the Kv.3 channel extracellular pore region further showed that the
   Dsp371, Thr373 and His399 residues of outer pore region of Kv1.3 channel
   played important roles in MTX inhibiting activities. In conclusion, MTX
   inhibited Kv1.3 channel by targeting extracellular pore region, which is
   different form all the report small molecules, such as PAP-1 and 4-AP,
   but similar with many natural animal toxin peptides, such as ChTX, ShK
   and BmKTX. To the best of our knowledge, MTX is the first small
   molecular scaffold targeting the Kv1.3 channel extracellular pore
   region, suggesting its potential applications for designing novel Kv1.3
   lead drugs and treating Kv1.3 channel-associated autoimmune diseases.

Abstract = {{Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a leading cause of cancer-related
   human mortality with a clear need for new therapeutic intervention.
   GDC-0349 is a potent and selective ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor. In
   A549 cells and primary human NSCLC cells, GDC-0349 inhibited cell
   growth, proliferation, cell cycle progression, migration and invasion,
   while inducing significant apoptosis activation. Although GDC-0349
   blocked Akt-mTORC1/2 activation in NSCLC cells, it also exerted
   cytotoxicity in Akt1-knockout A549 cells. Furthermore, restoring
   Akt-mTOR activation by a constitutively-active Akt1 only partially
   attenuated GDC-0349-induced A549 cell apoptosis, indicating the
   existence of Akt-mTOR-independent mechanisms. In NSCLC cells GDC-0349
   induced sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) inhibition, ceramide accumulation,
   JNK activation and oxidative injury. Conversely, N-acetylcysteine, the
   JNK inhibitor and sphingosine 1-phosphate alleviated GDC-0349-induced
   NSCLC cell apoptosis. In vivo, daily oral administration of GDC-0349
   potently inhibited NSCLC xenograft growth in mice. Akt-mTOR
   in-activation, SphK1 inhibition, JNK activation and oxidative stress
   were detected in NSCLC xenograft tissues with GDC-0349 administration.
   In summary, GDC-0349 inhibits NSCLC cell growth via Akt-mTOR-dependent
   and Akt-mTOR-independent mechanisms.}},

Title = {{Evolutions of structural and optical properties of lead-free double
   perovskite Cs2TeCl6 under high pressure}},
Journal = {{ACTA PHYSICA SINICA}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have been
   widely used in solar cells, photodetectors, and light-emitting diodes
   due to their advantages such as high light absorption coefficient, good
   carrier mobility, and long carrier diffusion length. However, the high
   toxicity of lead and poor stability still restrict the application and
   promotion of such materials. The lead-free double perovskite material
   derived from the concept of ``heterovalent substitution{''} , while
   maintaining the high symmetrical structure of perovskite, avoids using
   the toxic lead elements, which has the advantages of environmental
   friendly, stable structure, and suitable band gap. At present, the
   limited research on lead-free double perovskite materials still leaves a
   big room to researchers, and such a limited research seriously restricts
   the development and promotion of such materials. Therefore, the
   relationship between the structure and performance of lead-free double
   perovskite materials needs further exploring in order to provide
   theoretical basis for the practical application of such materials. Here
   in this work, the lead-free double perovskite material Cs2TeCl6 is
   prepared by the solution method. The crystal structure and optical
   properties of the lead-free double perovskite Cs2TeCl6 under high
   pressure are investigated by using diamond anvil cell combined with
   in-situ high-pressure angle-dispersive X-ray diffraction and
   ultraviolet-visible absorption technology. The results show that the
   crystal structure of Cs2TeCl6 is not changed within the experimental
   pressure range of 0-50.0 GPa, and the structural symmetry of Fm-3m is
   still maintained, indicating the sample has good stability. The lattice
   constant and volume of Cs2TeCl6 gradually decrease within the pressure
   range of 0- 50.0 GPa. The volume and pressure of Cs2TeCl6 are fitted
   using the third-order Birch-Mumaghan equation of state, the bulk elastic
   modulus is obtained to be B-0 = (18.77 +/- 2.88) GPa. The smaller bulk
   elastic modulus indicates that the lead-free double perovskite material
   Cs2TeCl6 has higher compressibility. The optical band gap of Cs2TeCl6 is
   2.68(3) eV at 1 atm and its optical band gap gradually decreases with
   the increase of pressure, which is related to the shrinkage of
   octahedral {[}TeCl6](2-) under high pressure. The calculation results
   show that the Cs2TeCl6 possesses an indirect band gap, the valence band
   maximum is mainly composed of Cl 3p orbits, and the conduction band
   minimum is mainly composed of Te 5p and Cl 3p orbits. After the pressure
   is completely relieved, Cs2TeCl6 returns to the initial state. The above
   conclusions further deepen the understanding of the crystal structure
   and optical properties of lead-free double perovskite Cs2TeCl6, and
   provide a theoretical basis for designing and optimizing the lead-free
   double perovskite materials.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Although not a life-threatening condition, infertility does
   influence various aspects of life. Based on a meta-analysis of the
   relevant literature, the aim of this study is to identify the
   psychosocial consequences of infertility in Iranian women.
   Methods: Comprehensive Portal of Human Sciences, Magiran, Scientific
   Information Database, Noormags, MEDLIB, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar,
   Medline, and ProQuest were the databases searched from inception (1999)
   to 2018. To maximize the comprehensiveness of the search, the reference
   lists of all the relevant papers identified were manually examined. The
   evaluation of the content was based on PRISMA guidelines, and
   Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software was used for data analysis.
   Results: Based on the analysis of 124 quantitative papers, the
   psychosocial consequences of infertility in women in Iran can be
   classified into 14 categories: psychological well-being (effect size =
   3.10), adaptation to infertility (effect size = 2.71), quality of life
   (effect size = 1.83), depression (effect size = 1.80), anxiety (effect
   size = 1.72), marital relationships (effect size = 1.37), personality
   disorders (effect size = 1.37), violence (effect size = 1.31), social
   support (effect size = 0.90), self-efficacy (effect size = 0.90), coping
   strategies (effect size = 0.84), irrational thoughts (effect size =
   0.77), somatization disorders (effect size = 0.65), and sexual
   dysfunction (effect size = 0.55).
   Conclusion: Considering the wide-ranging psychosocial consequences of
   infertility in women, it is necessary for treatment to account for
   psychological factors.}},

Abstract = {{Aposematic and sexual signals are often characterized by bright, highly
   contrasting colors. Many species can see colors beyond the human visible
   spectrum, and ultraviolet (UV) reflection has been found to play an
   important role in communication and sexual selection. However, the role
   of UV in aposematic signals is poorly explored. Poison frogs frequently
   produce high-contrast signals that have been linked to both aposematism
   and intraspecific communication. Yet despite considerable efforts
   studying interspecific and intraspecific diversity in color, poison
   frogs are not known to perceive UV, and UV reflection of the integument
   has not been described. We report UV-reflective spots in a population of
   Oophaga sylvatica and quantify the effect of UV on visual contrast with
   models of avian vision. We found that the frogs are highly contrasting,
   but UV had a minimal effect on signal saliency. These data highlight the
   importance of considering UV reflectance within aposematic signals, but
   that UV should not necessarily be regarded as an independent signal.}},

Abstract = {{This work is interested in the critical changes in the load-independent

   descends unsmilingly the mechanical durability, stability, strength,
   toughness, critical stress, stiffness and flexural strengths of Bi-2212
   superconducting solids studied owing to the increment of crystal
   structural problems. Moreover, it is obtained that the degradation in
   the crystal structural leads to diminish the typical ISE characteristic
   of Bi-2212 superconducting ceramic compounds. At the same time, the

Abstract = {{Objective. Our aim was to analyze the influence of Yinzhihuang granules
   on serum liver enzymes in jaundice patients and to provide real-world
   evidence for the efficacy evaluation of Yinzhihuang granules in treating
   jaundice. Methods. We constructed a data warehouse which integrates
   real-world electronic medical records from the hospital information
   system of multiple 3A hospitals in China and used a descriptive
   statistical method to analyze the changes in the serum liver enzymes of
   the jaundice patients treated with Yinzhihuang granules and then used
   Wilcoxon signed-rank to test the changes in the indicators caused by the
   treatment. Results. After being treated with Yinzhihuang granules, the
   jaundice patients had a decrease in the average serum levels of total
   bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, glutamyl
   transpeptidase, and alkaline phosphatase, and the differences were
   statistically significant (P<0.05) but had no significant changes in the
   average serum levels of direct bilirubin and alanine aminotransferase
   (P>0.05). Conclusion. The data analysis on the real-world electronic
   medical records demonstrate that Yinzhihuang granules help to reduce
   jaundice patients' serum levels of total bilirubin, indirect bilirubin,
   aspartate aminotransferase, glutamyl transpeptidase, and alkaline
   phosphatase, but there is no evidence that Yinzhihuang granules help to
   reduce the jaundice patients' serum levels of direct bilirubin and

Abstract = {{Adding a two-dimensional (2D) overlayer on a metal surface is a
   promising route for activating reactants confined in the interfacial
   space. However, an atomistic understanding of the role played by
   undercoordinated sites of the 2D overlayer in the activation of
   molecules in this nanoscaled confined space is yet to be developed. In
   this paper, we study CO dissociation as a prototypical reaction to
   investigate CO activation in the confined space enclosed by Rh(111) and
   a monolayer of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). The effect of the space
   size (i.e., the distance between h-BN and the metal surface), the type
   of undercoordinated sites, and the size of the defect are explicitly
   studied by density functional theory with dispersion correction. The
   following temperature-programmed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
   measurement suggests that a small portion of the CO dissociated during
   the desorption, leaving the residual atomic oxygen incorporated into the
   h-BN lattice, which validates the theoretical prediction. The
   combination of theory and experiment calls for further attention to be
   paid to the role of undercoordinated sites in the 2D overlayers in
   confined systems forming potential new catalytic environments.}},

Title = {{Experimental investigation of the heat transfer behaviors of CO2,

   in helically coiled tube}},
Journal = {{APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{180}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{The non-azeotropic natural mixture, propane/CO2, in trans-critical
   Rankine cycle shows some special advantages in operation safe,
   thermodynamic performance and exergo-economic performance. The
   improvement of the system performance depends on further in-depth
   investigation on the heat transfer of propane/CO2 mixture above critical
   pressure which has not been performed yet. In this paper, the heat
   transfer behaviors of CO2, propane and their non-azeotropic mixtures in
   helically coiled tube are investigated and compared by experiments. The
   mass fractions of the mixtures are measured by Fourier Transform
   Infrared Spectrometer. The effects of operating parameters under various
   mass fractions on heat transfer are discussed. The general law of mass
   fraction on heat transfer is got under the same pressure ratio (P/P) by
   experimental results. The peak of heat transfer coefficient increases as
   propane increases when the mass fraction of propane changes from 22.24\%
   to 100\%. The heat transfer coefficient of the mixtures has little
   variations with pressure because the specific heat of the mixtures has a
   slight decrease as pressure increases. The complicated heat transfer
   characteristics of the propane/CO2 mixtures are analyzed based on the
   buoyancy force and the thermal effect in heat surface. In the helically
   coiled tube, the heat transfer of the mixture is mainly dominated by
   curvature effect and the effect of the low-density in boundary layer
   becomes smaller and smaller as propane increases. The experimental data
   are predicted by a correlation. The results show that for various
   compositions, 80\% of the data are predicted within 20\%, and 95\% are

Title = {{Paeoniflorin inhibits IgE-mediated allergic reactions by suppressing the
   degranulation of mast cells though binding with FceRI alpha subunits}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{886}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Paeoniflorin (PF), a monoterpene glycoside isolated from the aqueous
   extract of the Chinese herb Radix Paeoniae Alba, has been used for
   treating various inflammatory diseases. In this study, we aimed to
   investigate the antiallergic activities of PF. The anti-anaphylactic
   activity of PF was investigated using mast cell (MC) degranulation assay
   as well as Ca2+ influx in vitro and skin swelling and extravasation
   assays in vivo. The results showed that PF inhibited MC degranulation
   (histamine release from 74.5 +/- 4.95 ng/ml to 58.7 +/- 6.06 ng/ml) and
   Ca2+ influx challenged by DNP-BSA in vitro. In addition, PF reduced the
   degree of swelling and Evans blue exudation in mice paws. Furthermore,
   PF dose-dependently reduced serum inflammatory mediator release in mice
   sensitized with ovalbumin for 48 h by inhibiting MC degranulation.
   Molecular docking study revealed that PF bound better with the a subunit
   of FccRI than with the p. subunit. SPR revealed that PF had a strong
   affinity interaction with FccRI a subunit and the K-D value was (7.08
   +/- 0.97) e-6 M. Our findings revealed that PF inhibited anaphylactic
   responses in vivo and in vitro, and it can be considered a novel FccRI
   inhibitor for preventing MC-related allergic diseases.}},

Abstract = {{DNA-templated silver clusters are chromophores in which the nucleobases
   encode the cluster spectra and brightness. We describe the coordination
   environments of two nearly identical Ag-10(6+) clusters that form with
   18-nucleotide strands CCCCA CCCCT CCCX TTTT, with X = guanosine and
   inosine. For the first time, femtosecond time-resolved infrared (TRIR)
   spectroscopy with visible excitation and mid-infrared probing is used to
   correlate the response of nucleobase vibrational modes to electronic
   excitation of the metal cluster. A rich pattern of transient TRIR peaks
   in the 1400-1720 cm(-1) range decays synchronously with the visible
   emission. Specific infrared signatures associated with the single
   guanosine/inosine along with a subset of cytidines, but not the
   thymidines, are observed. These fingerprints suggest that the network of
   bonds between a silver cluster adduct and its polydentate DNA ligands
   can be deciphered to rationally tune the coordination and thus spectra
   of molecular silver chromophores.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is an aggressive type of
   cancer with poor prognosis and outcomes. This study aimed to investigate
   clinicopathological features, molecular characteristics, and treatments
   among Chinese patients diagnosed with IBC.
   Methods: We collected data of 95 patients with IBC who were treated by
   members of the Chinese Society of Breast Surgery, from January 2017 to
   December 2018. The data, including demographic characteristics,
   pathological findings, surgical methods, systemic treatment plans, and
   follow-up, were obtained using a uniform electronic questionnaire. The
   clinicopathological features of different molecular types in patients
   without distant metastases were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis (H)
   test followed by post hoc analyses.
   Results: Lymph node metastasis was noted in 75.8\% of all patients,
   while distant metastasis was noted in 21.4\%. Pathological findings
   indicated invasive ductal and lobular carcinomas in 86.8\% and 5.3\% of
   cases, respectively. Hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/human epidermal
   growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) (41.5\%) and HR-/HER2+
   (20.1\%) were the most common biologic subtypes, followed by HR+/HER2+
   (19.1\%) and HR-/HER2- (19.1\%). Stage III IBC was treated via
   pre-operative neoadjuvant chemotherapy in 87.7\% of the cases,
   predominantly using anthracycline and taxanes. A total of 91.9\% of
   patients underwent surgical treatment. Among them, 77.0\% of the
   patients underwent modified radical mastectomy, 8.1\% of whom also
   underwent immediate breast reconstruction. The Kruskal-Wallis test
   revealed that the efficacy of chemotherapy significantly differed among
   those with HR+/HER2- and HR-/HER2- tumors (adjusted P = 0.008), and
   Ki-67 expression significantly differed in HR-/HER2+ and HR+/HER2+
   molecular subtypes (adjusted P = 0.008).
   Conclusion: Our study provides novel insight into clinicopathological
   characteristics and treatment status among patients with IBC in China,
   and might provide a direction and basis for further studies.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To assess the outcomes of non-metastatic poorly differentiated
   gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs) treated with
   radical surgery. Methods Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
   (SEER) database (1998-2015) was accessed, and patients with
   non-metastatic poorly differentiated/undifferentiated GEP-NENs were
   reviewed. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate
   factors affecting overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival
   (CSS). Patients treated with radical surgery were matched to those who
   did not undergo surgery through propensity score matching and
   Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were used to evaluate the impact of
   surgery in the post-propensity cohort. Results A total of 1517 patients
   were included. Within multivariable Cox regression models and compared
   to no surgery, radical surgery was associated with improved OS (HR:
   0.41; 95\% CI: 0.34-0.50) and CSS (HR: 0.37; 95\% CI: 0.29-0.47). A
   total of 233 patients who underwent no surgery were then matched to 233
   patients who underwent radical surgery. Within the post-propensity
   cohort, radical surgery was associated with improved OS (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions Radical surgery is associated with improved survival
   outcomes in patients with non-metastatic poorly differentiated GEP-NENs.
   Further studies are required to better identify the best timing of
   radical surgery within the context of multimodal management.}},

Title = {{Gall Bladder Wall Thickening in Dengue Fever - Aid in Labelling Dengue
   Hemorrhagic Fever and a Marker of Severity}},
Journal = {{CUREUS}},

Abstract = {{Introduction
   Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease spread by the bite of the
   Aedes aegypti mosquito. Dengue epidemics have contributed to a great
   economic burden, especially in South-East Asia. This study aimed to
   determine gall bladder wall thickness (GBWT) in patients with dengue
   fever, assess its sensitivity and specificity to identify dengue
   hemorrhagic fever, and also compare gall bladder wall thickening (GWBT)
   with platelets, hematocrit, and leucocyte count.
   Materials and methods
   This prospective observational study was conducted in the dengue ward of
   Benazir Bhutto Hospital, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, from September 2019 to
   January 2020, i.e., four months. Patients admitted to the dengue ward
   diagnosed as seropositive and provided consent were enrolled into the
   study. Laboratory investigations (blood complete picture, liver function
   tests, renal function tests) were collected and recorded.
   Ultrasonography was performed on admission and subsequently during a
   hospital stay. Patients were divided into two groups: those with gall
   bladder wall thickness <= 3mm and (>)3mm. All data were entered and
   analyzed on SPSS version 24 (IBM Inc., Armonk, USA).
   Results
   Out of 180 patients, 122 (67.8\%) were male, and 58 (32.2\%) female. The
   mean age was 33 +/- 13 years. One hundred and six patients (58.9\%) were
   diagnosed with dengue fever, 68 (37.8\%) - dengue hemorrhagic fever, and
   six (3.3\%) - dengue shock syndrome. The most common finding was gall
   bladder wall thickness (>)3mm (69/180; 38.3\%) followed by ascites
   (38.1\%). Sixty-two patients out of 69 (89.9\%) with GBWT (>)3mm were
   managed as dengue hemorrhagic fever (p=0.(00). Alanine transaminase
   (ALT), platelet, and total leukocyte count (TLC) were associated
   positively with an edematous gall bladder wall (p<0.005). The mean gall
   bladder wall thickness for dengue hemorrhagic fever was 6.4mm +/- 2.5
   mm. A GBWT value of 3.5mm was found to have 94.6\% specificity and
   91.2\% sensitivity.
   Conclusion
   Gall bladder wall edema is strongly correlated with dengue hemorrhagic
   fever. Hence it should be assessed in all patients with dengue fever.}},

Journal = {{THERAPEUTIC COMMUNITIES}},

Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{113-127}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - This paper aims to describe the impact of the COVID-19
   pandemic on a prison-based therapeutic community (TC).
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper takes the form of a case study
   where the authors reflect on their current practice. using the findings
   of research on social isolation and the overarching TC principles to
   explore the effect of the pandemic on the TC at HMP Grendon. The authors
   consider how the residents and staff adjusted to the change as the
   parameters changed when the social distancing rules were imposed and how
   they adapted to the prolonged break to therapy. Sections in the paper
   were written by a resident and an operational member of staff. The
   authors conclude with their thoughts on how to manage the consequences
   the lockdown has brought and start to think about what returning to
   ``normality{''} might mean.
   Findings - The paper describes the adjustments made by the residents and
   staff as the UK Government imposed the lockdown. The authors, including
   a resident and an operational member of staff comment on the
   psychological and practical impact these adjustments had. The thought is
   given to the idea of ``recovery{''}, returning to ``normality{''} and
   how this study can be best managed once restrictions are lifted.
   Research limitations/implications - At the time of writing, there are no
   confirmed cases of COVID-19 at HMP Grendon. The measures and commitment
   from all staff and residents in the prison to keep the prison
   environment safe may in part account for this. This paper explores the
   effects of lockdown on the emotional environment in a TC and highlights
   the consequences that social isolation can have on any individual. To
   the authors' knowledge, there is currently no research undertaken on the
   impact of lockdown/social isolation on a TC. This research would be
   useful, as the authors postulate from reflections on current practice
   that the effects of the lockdown will be greater in a social therapy
   environment.
   Originality/value - HMP Grendon started in 1962, as this time there have
   been no significant events that have meant the suspension of therapy for
   such a sustained period. It is, therefore, important that the impact of
   such is considered and reflected upon.}},

Abstract = {{Particle irradiation is known to give rise to several majority carrier
   traps in the band gap of n-type 4H-SiC, in the 0.4-1.6 eV energy range
   below the conduction band edge (E-C). Among these traps, the EH1
   (E-C-0.4 eV) and the EH3 (E-C-0.7 eV) are the least thermally stable
   ones and not much is known on their microscopic origin. In order to
   understand the nature of EH1 and EH3, their annealing kinetics was
   studied by means of deep level transient spectroscopy and the results
   were interpreted by invoking the diffusion-limited theory. It is found
   that EH1 and EH3 are two different charge states of the same defect,
   labeled EH-center, that anneals out with an activation energy of similar
   to 1.1 eV and whose nature is related to a carbon interstitial. Our
   study shows that the EH-center is not the same as the S-center defect
   which was reported by previous studies found in the literature.}},

   Posterior Chamber Phakic Toric Intraocular Lens at Two Different
   Surgical Facilities: A Series of Unfortunate Events}},
Journal = {{CASE REPORTS IN OPHTHALMOLOGICAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Background. Phakic Intraocular Lens (P-IOL) implantation is a safe,
   easy, predictable intervention designed to manage moderate to high
   refractive errors. Complications are relatively uncommon and include
   mainly cataract and intraocular pressure spikes. Toxic Anterior Segment
   Syndrome (TASS) is a rather unusual sterile anterior segment
   inflammation after uneventful intraocular surgery, extremely rarely
   reported after P-IOL implantation. Urrets-Zavalia Syndrome (UZS) is also
   very rarely described after P-IOL. To date, to the best of the authors'
   knowledge, no article has ever described the simultaneous occurrence of
   TASS and UZS in a patient after P-IOL implantation. Objective. In this
   article, the authors present the case of a female patient with moderate
   myopic astigmatism, who underwent sequential P-IOL implantation at two
   different facilities. The postoperative course of the first eye was
   uneventful, but she developed complications associated to the
   intervention in the second eye. Materials. The article describes the
   case of a young patient who underwent a sequential Phakic Intraocular
   Lens (P-IOL) implantation at two different institutions. The
   postoperative course of the first eye (left eye) was uneventful;
   however, the second eye (right eye) initially developed Toxic Anterior
   Segment Syndrome (TASS). Although timely and correct management was
   instituted, upon resolution of TASS, the patient developed
   Urrets-Zavalia Syndrome, anterior subcapsular cataract, and significant
   endothelial damage in the same eye. Results. The patient was followed
   closely and managed accordingly; corneal edema and anterior segment
   inflammation of the right eye eventually resolved. Nevertheless, an
   anterior subcapsular cataract and a fixed dilated pupil remained; with
   normal intraocular pressure (IOP). Specular microscopy confirmed an
   endothelial cell loss in the TASS eye (right eye). Pupil size showed no
   reaction to repeated doses of Pilocarpine 2\%. A month after surgery,
   refraction on her right eye was +0.25+0.75x93, which resulted in a 20/50
   vision. Conclusions. TASS and UZS are both extremely rare complications
   after uneventful P-IOL implantation, with only a handful of cases having
   been reported of each of them. To date, this is the very first case
   where UZS ensued after and potentially as a consequence of TASS in a
   patient who had undergone P-IOL implantation. Although a direct
   causative element could not be pinpointed, the fact that the
   complication ensued after being operated in one surgical institution and
   not the other, could suggest some role of different sterilization and
   handling procedures, but no direct conclusion can be made on this case.}},

Abstract = {{Reconfigurable microwave devices which operate without any external bias
   magnetic field are of great importance for monolithic device integration
   of microwave components. Magnetic nanostructures and arrays are found to
   be promising due to the ease of their control parameters. However, use
   of a bias magnetic field for tunable microwave operation hinders the
   advantage of nanomagnets. Here, we propose a novel method for
   reconfigurable microwave operation based on zigzag nanowires which do
   not require any external bias magnetic field. Tunable microwave
   operation relies on reconfigurable remanent magnetic states which are
   associated with distinct magnetization dynamic responses. Owing to two
   different domain configurations for different remanent magnetic states,
   variation of internal magnetic fields governs the observed tunability of
   microwave operating frequency. In addition, microwave properties are
   highly sensitive to the zigzag angle which offers additional
   functionality along with bias-field-free operation.}},

   other immigrant groups. Hmong refugees arrived in the United States with
   lower levels of human capital, so their economic progress was slow.

Abstract = {{The ``self{''} shapes the way in which we process the world around us.
   It makes sense then, that self-related information is reliably
   prioritised over non self-related information in cognition. How might
   other factors such as self-compatibility shape the way self-relevant
   information is prioritised? The present work asks whether affective
   consistency between the self and arbitrarily self-associated stimuli
   influences the degree to which self-prioritisation can be observed. To
   this end, participants were asked to associate themselves with either a
   positive or a negative concept and to then indicate if a given stimulus
   (Experiment 1: Emotional faces; Experiment 2: Luminance cues) and an
   identity label matched. If affective consistency is key to
   self-prioritisation, negative constructs should dampen
   self-prioritisation and positive constructs should boost
   self-prioritisation because the self is universally construed as
   positive. Indeed, the results of the two experiments indicate that
   participants who made the negative association had more difficulty
   confirming whether the stimulus and the label matched than those who
   made the positive association. The implications of this finding are
   discussed in terms of ``self{''} theories that span various levels of
   information processing. The data reveal that self-referential
   information processing goes beyond a default elevation of priority to
   the self.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The field of deliberative democracy has long recognised the role of
   interruptive protests to make polities more sensitive to good reasons.
   But how exactly interruptive protests enhance deliberative systems
   remain an open question. `Non-deliberative acts may have deliberative
   consequences' is a crucial line of argument in the deliberative systems
   literature, but the precise character of these consequences is yet to be
   spelled out. In this article, I describe three ways in which
   consequences of interruptive protests enhance the deliberative system. I
   argue that interruptive protests can redistribute (1) voice and
   visibility, (2) attention, and (3) deliberative agency which, in turn,
   can lay bare the weaknesses of a dysfunctional deliberative system. The
   arguments I put forward are based on interpretive case studies focusing
   on protest movements in the Philippines and Puerto Rico in the aftermath
   of record-breaking hurricanes. Overall, this paper seeks to clarify the
   relationship between deliberative politics and protest action, by
   identifying the distinctive contributions of interruptive protests in
   redistributing power in dysfunctional deliberative systems.}},

Abstract = {{Background Dermatophytosis is one of the most common infections
   affecting 3\%-17\% of the population. Resistance to antifungals so far
   was not of concern in the therapeutic management. However, recent
   reports of terbinafine-resistant strains in several countries are
   worrisome making antifungal susceptibility testing inevitable.
   Objectives We aimed to develop and evaluate an optimised broth
   microdilution assay for antifungal drug susceptibility testing of
   dermatophytes.
   Methods We first studied the effect of different inocula, incubation
   temperatures and incubation times to establish an optimised assay.
   Subsequently, we tested 79 clinical strains of 11 dermatophyte species
   with 13 antifungals.
   Results We found inoculating with 0.5-5 x 10(4) colony forming units
   (CFU) and incubating at 29 degrees C +/- 1 degrees C for 4 days to be
   appropriate. Terbinafine was the most active antifungal agent with
   minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values <= 0.06 mu g/mL, expect
   for one resistant T mentagrophytes strain, which was isolated from an
   Indian patient. Also, a majority of MICs of other antifungals that are
   commonly used to treat dermatophytosis were low, except those of
   fluconazole. Fluconazole MICs do not correlate with the good efficacy in
   the clinical management.
   Conclusions Our assay enables fast and reliable susceptibility testing
   of dermatophytes with a large panel of different antifungals. This helps
   to improve the therapeutic management of dermatophytosis by detecting
   resistant strains.}},

Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Curcumin is known to exist in three polymorphs (forms I, II, and III) in
   the solid state. The most common polymorph of curcumin (form I) is
   monoclinic in the space group P2/n, whereas the other two uncommon forms
   are both orthorhombic with the space groups of Pca2(1) and Pbca for
   forms II and III, respectively. While crystal structures are known for
   all three polymorphs of curcumin, their solid-state NMR signatures are
   incomplete in the literature. In this study, we report a complete set of
   solid-state H-1, C-13, and O-17 NMR data for form III of curcumin. In
   addition, we discovered that form III of curcumin prepared by repeated
   drying from methanol is not stable, which undergoes slow structural
   transition to form II in the solid state over a period of days at room
   temperature. As a result, we were able to obtain new solid-state O-17
   NMR data for form II of curcumin, which complements the existing
   solid-state H-1 and C-13 NMR data for this polymorph in the literature.
   We compare experimental NMR parameters with calculated values by the
   GIPAW DFT and dispersion corrected DFT-D2 methods. We found that while
   the computed C-13 chemical shifts are generally in excellent agreement
   with experimental values, the quality of the computed H-1 and O-17 NMR
   chemical shifts is less satisfactory. This may imply that it is
   necessary to include the nuclear quantum effects in future quantum
   chemical calculations to account for potential proton tunneling and
   dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Policy mixes (i.e. the total structure of policy processes, strategies,
   and instruments) are complex constructs that can quickly become
   incoherent, inconsistent, and incomprehensive. This is amplified when
   the policy mix strives to meet multiple objectives simultaneously, such
   as in the case of large carnivore policy mixes. Building on Rogge and
   Reichardt's analytical framework for the analysis of policy mixes, we
   compare the policy mixes of Norway, Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands,
   Germany (specifically Saxony and Bavaria), and Spain (specifically
   Castilla y Leon). The study shows that the large carnivore policy mixes
   in the case countries show signs of lacking vertical and horizontal
   coherence in the design of policy processes, weak consistency between
   objectives and designated policy instruments, and, as a consequence,
   lacking comprehensiveness. We conclude that creating consistent,
   coherent, and comprehensive policy mixes that build on multiple
   objectives requires stepping away from sectorized policy development,
   toward a holistic, systemic approach, strong collaborative structures
   across policy boundaries and regions, the inclusion of diverse
   stakeholders, and constant care and attention to address all objectives
   simultaneously rather than in isolation.}},

Title = {{Towards a better understanding of the low recall of insertion variants
   with short-read based variant callers}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{21}},

Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundSince 2009, numerous tools have been developed to detect
   structural variants using short read technologies. Insertions >50 bp are
   one of the hardest type to discover and are drastically underrepresented
   in gold standard variant callsets. The advent of long read technologies
   has completely changed the situation. In 2019, two independent cross
   technologies studies have published the most complete variant callsets
   with sequence resolved insertions in human individuals. Among the
   reported insertions, only 17 to 28\% could be discovered with short-read
   based tools.ResultsIn this work, we performed an in-depth analysis of
   these unprecedented insertion callsets in order to investigate the
   causes of such failures. We have first established a precise
   classification of insertion variants according to four layers of
   characterization: the nature and size of the inserted sequence, the
   genomic context of the insertion site and the breakpoint junction
   complexity. Because these levels are intertwined, we then used
   simulations to characterize the impact of each complexity factor on the
   recall of several structural variant callers. We showed that most
   reported insertions exhibited characteristics that may interfere with
   their discovery: 63\% were tandem repeat expansions, 38\% contained
   homology larger than 10 bp within their breakpoint junctions and 70\%
   were located in simple repeats. Consequently, the recall of short-read
   based variant callers was significantly lower for such insertions (6\%
   for tandem repeats vs 56\% for mobile element insertions). Simulations
   showed that the most impacting factor was the insertion type rather than
   the genomic context, with various difficulties being handled differently
   among the tested structural variant callers, and they highlighted the
   lack of sequence resolution for most insertion calls.ConclusionsOur
   results explain the low recall by pointing out several difficulty
   factors among the observed insertion features and provide avenues for
   improving SV caller algorithms and their combinations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies how many orthogonal bi-invariant complex structures
   exist on a metric Lie algebra over the real numbers. Recently, it was
   shown that irreducible Lie algebras which are additionally 2-step
   nilpotent admit at most one orthogonal bi-invariant complex structure up
   to sign. The main result generalizes this statement to metric Lie
   algebras with any number of irreducible factors and which are not
   necessarily 2-step nilpotent. It states that there are either 0 or 2(k)
   such complex structures, with k the number of irreducible factors of the
   metric Lie algebra. The motivation for this problem comes from
   differential geometry, for instance to construct non-parallel
   Killing-Yano 2-forms on nilmanifolds or to describe the compact
   Chern-flat quasi-Kahler manifolds. The main tool we develop is the
   unique orthogonal decomposition into irreducible factors for metric Lie
   algebras with no non-trivial abelian factor. This is a generalization of
   a recent result which only deals with nilpotent Lie algebras over the
   real numbers. Not only do we apply this fact to describe the orthogonal
   bi-invariant complex structures on a given metric Lie algebra, but it
   also gives us a method to study different inner products on a given Lie
   algebra, computing the number of irreducible factors and orthogonal
   bi-invariant complex structures for varying inner products.}},

Title = {{A tumour suppressive relationship between mineralocorticoid and retinoic

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Background The role of nuclear receptors in both the aetiology and
   treatment of breast cancer is exemplified by the use of the oestrogen
   receptor (ER) as a prognostic marker and treatment target. Treatments
   targeting the oestrogen signalling pathway are initially highly
   effective for most patients. However, for the breast cancers that fail
   to respond, or become resistant, to current endocrine treatments, the
   long-term outlook is poor. ER is a member of the nuclear receptor
   superfamily, comprising 48 members in the human, many of which are
   expressed in the breast and could be used as alternative targets in
   cases where current treatments are ineffective. Methods We used sparse
   canonical correlation analysis to interrogate potential novel nuclear
   receptor expression relationships in normal breast and breast cancer.
   These were further explored using whole transcriptome profiling in
   breast cancer cells after combinations of ligand treatments. Results
   Using this approach, we discovered a tumour suppressive relationship
   between the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and retinoic acid receptors
   (RAR), in particular RAR beta. Expression profiling of MR expressing
   breast cancer cells revealed that mineralocorticoid and retinoid
   co-treatment activated an expression program consistent with a reverse
   Warburg effect and growth inhibition, which was not observed with either
   ligand alone. Moreover, high expression of both MR and RARB was
   associated with improved breast cancer-specific survival. Conclusion Our
   study reveals a previously unknown relationship between MR and RAR in
   the breast, which is dependent on menopausal state and altered in
   malignancy. This finding identifies potential new targets for the
   treatment of breast cancers that are refractory to existing therapeutic
   options.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose The purpose of this study was to determine the most reliable
   radiographic measurement method to evaluate PTS as a risk factor for ACL
   reconstruction failure. Methods Patients who underwent ACL
   reconstruction or ACL revision reconstruction between January 2009 and
   December 2014 by a single surgeon were included. Fifty-two consecutive
   patients who underwent ACL revision reconstruction were compared to a
   random selection of 52 patients who underwent primary ACL reconstruction
   and a control group of 52 patients without ACL injury. ACL
   reconstruction was performed using either ipsilateral (primary) or
   contralateral (revision) quadrupled hamstring autograft. Lateral knee
   radiographs were evaluated using three methods: (1) longitudinal axis,
   (2) anterior tibial cortex axis, and (3) posterior tibial cortex.
   Results A significant difference was found between subjects who
   underwent ACL reconstruction and control knees (6.79 degrees vs. 5.31
   degrees, p = 0.046) using the posterior tibial cortex method. No other
   statistical significance was found between groups. A multiple linear
   regression analysis found that the PTS as measured by any method was not
   affected by the patient's age, sex, height, weight, and BMI. All methods
   of measurement for PTS demonstrated excellent (ICC > 0.90) intra-rater
   and inter-rater reliability, but only the posterior tibial cortex method
   maintained excellent intra-rater and inter-rater reliability (ICC >
   0.90) when evaluating patients with ACL revision reconstruction.
   Conclusions The posterior tibial cortex measurement is the most reliable
   method for analyzing the PTS on lateral knee radiographs in patients
   undergoing ACL revision reconstruction.}},

Title = {{New Amphiphilic Squalene Derivative Improves Metabolism of Adipocytes
   Differentiated From Diabetic Adipose-Derived Stem Cells and Prevents
   Excessive Lipogenesis}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN CELL AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Squalene (Sq) is a natural compound, found in various plant oils, algae,
   and larger quantity in deep-sea shark liver. It is also known as an
   intermediate of cholesterol synthesis in plants and animals including
   humans. Although evidences demonstrated its antioxidant, anticancer,
   hypolipidemic, and hepatoprotective and cardioprotective effects, its
   biological effects in cellular function might have been underestimated
   because of the water-insoluble property. To overcome this
   hydrophobicity, we synthesized new amphiphilic Sq derivative (HH-Sq). On
   the other hand, adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) are a valuable source
   in regenerative medicine for its ease of accessibility and multilineage
   differentiation potential. Nevertheless, impaired cellular functions of
   ASCs derived from diabetic donor have still been debated
   controversially. In this study, we explored the effect of the HH-Sq in
   comparison to Sq on the adipocyte differentiation of ASCs obtained from
   subjects with type 2 diabetes. Gene expression profile by microarray
   analysis at 14 days of adipogenic differentiation revealed that HH-Sq
   induced more genes involved in intracellular signaling processes,
   whereas Sq activated more transmembrane receptor pathway-related genes.
   In addition, more important number of down-regulated and up-regulated
   genes by Sq and HH-Sq were not overlapped, suggesting the compounds
   might not only have difference in their chemical property but also
   potentially exert different biological effects. Both Sq and HH-Sq
   improved metabolism of adipocytes by enhancing genes associated with
   energy homeostasis and insulin sensitivity, SIRT1, PRKAA2, and IRS1.
   Interestingly, Sq increased significantly early adipogenic markers and
   lipogenic gene expression such as PPARG, SREBF1, and CEBPA, but not
   HH-Sq. As a consequence, smaller and fewer lipid droplet formation was
   observed in HH-Sq-treated adipocytes. Based on our findings, we report
   that both Sq and HH-Sq improved adipocyte metabolism, but only HH-Sq
   prevented excessive lipogenesis without abrogating adipocyte
   differentiation. The beneficial effect of HH-Sq provides an importance
   of synthesized derivatives from a natural compound with therapeutic
   potentials in the application of cell therapies.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic studies of introduced non-native species are a valuable tool to
   investigate invasion history and pathways, source populations and
   multiple introductions of alien species, as well as evolutionary genetic
   changes following establishment in a new environment. We used a set of
   nine polymorphic microsatellites to analyse the population genetic
   structure of the introduced Asian shore crab Hemigrapsus takanoi along
   European coasts. Our dataset covered the complete known European range
   of the species, including the most recent records from Great Britain and
   the southwestern Baltic Sea. The results showed a similarly high genetic
   diversity of H. takanoi throughout Europe, and no indication of genetic
   bottlenecks during secondary spread, even in the most recently
   established populations. Analyses for population structure along
   geographic regions gave support for a separation between the Bay of
   Seine populations (northern France) and all other populations. Genetic
   differentiation within the North and Baltic Seas was more subtle and
   patchy, hinting to potential unrecognised introduction events, dispersal
   barriers and anthropogenic vector activity. The populations from the
   Baltic Sea and Great Britain clustered with the Wadden Sea populations,
   suggesting secondary introductions from the southeastern North Sea as
   likely invasion pathways. In summary, we suggest that a combination of
   anthropogenic secondary spread and the species' reproductive biology
   have prevented a loss of genetic diversity during its ongoing expansion.
   We argue that genetic data depicting population status shortly after an
   introduction event-like the British and Baltic Sea populations of H.
   takanoi-may provide important baseline data for investigations of
   genetic changes during establishment and adaptation processes.}},

Abstract = {{Obesity increases the risk for breast cancer and is associated with poor
   outcomes for cancer patients. A variety of rodent models have been used
   to investigate these relationships; however, key differences in
   experimental approaches, as well as unique aspects of rodent physiology
   lead to variability in how these valuable models are implemented. We
   combine expertise in the development and implementation of preclinical
   models of obesity and breast cancer to disseminate effective practices
   for studies that integrate these fields. In this review, we share, based
   on our experience, key considerations for model selection, highlighting
   important technical nuances and tips for use of preclinical models in
   studies that integrate obesity with breast cancer risk and progression.
   We describe relevant mouse and rat paradigms, specifically highlighting
   differences in breast tumor subtypes, estrogen production, and
   strategies to manipulate hormone levels. We also outline options for
   diet composition and housing environments to promote obesity in female
   rodents. While we have applied our experience to understanding
   obesity-associated breast cancer, the experimental variables we
   incorporate have relevance to multiple fields that investigate women's
   health.}},

Abstract = {{Although porous carbons have been widely used for capacitive
   deionization, the low accessible surface area because of the hydrophobic
   microporous structure results in unsatisfied desalination capacity,
   which drastically hinders their practical application. Herein, a novel
   carbon nanofiber fabric with a large accessible surface area was
   prepared by electrospinning using the uniformly dispersed ferrocene as a
   pore former. The carbon nanofiber fabric with good mechanical strength
   and flexibility can be directly used as a filter membrane to filter
   simulated sandy seawater. The high content of heteroatoms increases the
   surface polarity of the carbon nanofiber, while the well-controlled
   interconnected mesoporous structure of the optimized sample facilitates
   fast transport and adsorption of hydrated Na+ and Cl-. Thus, the
   hydrophilic carbon nanofiber fabric shows a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller
   surface area of 922 m(2) g(-1) and a large accessible surface area of
   405 m(2) g(-1), leading to a high capacitance of 263 F g(-1) in the NaCl
   electrolyte. Most importantly, it shows an ultrahigh desalination
   capacity of 19.34 mg g(-1), which is much higher than most of the
   previously reported carbon materials. The high desalination capacity,
   fast adsorption rate, and good cycle stability make the as-prepared
   carbon nanofiber fabric an attractive candidate for practical
   application.}},

   low-efficiency in high-voltage applications. A different implementation
   procedure of the coupled inductors, with lower winding-to-winding
   capacitance, is proposed. High-efficiency experimental results from a
   400 V 1.6 kW prototype have been achieved over a wide operating voltage
   range, thanks to the use of SiC devices and the modified coupled

Journal = {{MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{While raw earth can be used as a structural material, its water
   sensitivity limits its use in modern construction. Earth has a strong
   affinity with water. Both water imbibition and water vapour transfer
   have to be taken into consideration. This affinity can be a positive
   point to regulate indoor ambience, but it can also negatively affect
   earth's mechanical properties. To avoid this possible detrimental
   effect, bio-based additions are used all around the world to stabilize,
   protect from water and enhance the mechanical properties of earth-based
   building materials. Bio-based stabilizers have to limit liquid water
   absorption and maintain mechanical properties without acting as a water
   vapour barrier that can lead to durability issues. In this article,
   capillary water absorption and water vapour permeability measurements
   are performed for combinations of various earths and bio-based additions
   (linseed oil, xanthan gum, casein, alginate and tannins). Linseed oil
   and xanthan gum help to protect the earth-based samples from absorbing
   liquid water without affecting the water vapour transfer in these

Journal = {{BMC SURGERY}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Background Atlantoaxial fusion has been widely used for the treatment of
   atlantoaxial instability (AAI). However, atlantoaxial fusion sacrifices
   the motion of atlantoaxial articulation, and postoperative loss of
   cervical lordosis and aggravation of cervical kyphosis are observed. We
   investigated various factors under the hypothesis that the atlantodental
   interval (ADI) and T1 slope may be associated with sagittal alignment
   after atlantoaxial fusion in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
   Methods We retrospectively investigated 64 patients with RA who
   underwent atlantoaxial fusion due to AAI. Radiological factors,
   including the ADI, T1 slope, Oc-C2 angle, cervical sagittal vertical
   axis, and C2-C7 angle, were measured before and after surgery. Results
   The various factors associated with atlantoaxial fusion before and after
   surgery were compared according to the upper and lower preoperative
   ADIs. There was a significant difference in the T1 slope 1 year after
   surgery (p = 0.044) among the patients with lower preoperative ADI
   values. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the
   preoperative ADI (> 7.92 mm) defined in the receiver-operating
   characteristic curve analysis was an independent predictive factor for
   the increase in the T1 slope 1 year after atlantoaxial fusion (odds
   ratio, 4.59; 95\% confidence interval, 1.34-15.73; p = 0.015).
   Conclusion We found an association between the preoperative ADI and
   difference in the T1 slope after atlantoaxial fusion in the patients
   with RA. A preoperative ADI (> 7.92 mm) was an independent predictor for
   the increase in the T1 slope after atlantoaxial fusion. Therefore,
   performing surgical treatment when the ADI is low would lead to better
   cervical sagittal alignment.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives To systematically determine the diagnostic performance of
   computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for
   differentiating autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) from pancreatic ductal
   adenocarcinoma (PDAC), with a comparison between the two imaging
   modalities. Methods Literature search was conducted using PubMed and
   EMBASE databases to identify original articles published between 2009
   and 2019 reporting the diagnostic performance of CT and MRI for
   differentiating AIP from PDAC. The meta-analytic sensitivity and
   specificity of CT and MRI were calculated, and compared using a
   bivariate random effects model. Subgroup analysis for differentiating
   focal AIP from PDAC was performed. Results Of the 856 articles screened,
   11 eligible articles are remained, i.e., five studies for CT, four for
   MRI, and two for both. The meta-analytic summary sensitivity and
   specificity of CT were 59\% (95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 41-75\%)
   and 99\% (95\% CI, 88-100\%), respectively, while those of MRI were 84\%
   (95\% CI, 68-93\%) and 97\% (95\% CI, 87-99\%). MRI had a significantly
   higher meta-analytic summary sensitivity than CT (84\% vs. 59\%, p =
   0.02) but a similar specificity (97\% vs. 99\%, p = 0.18). In the
   subgroup analysis for focal AIP, the sensitivity for distinguishing
   between focal AIP and PDAC was lower than that for the overall analysis.
   MRI had a higher sensitivity than CT (76\% vs. 50\%, p = 0.28) but a
   similar specificity (97\% vs. 98\%, p = 0.07). Conclusion MRI might be
   clinically more useful to evaluate patients with AIP, particularly for
   differentiating AIP from PDAC.}},

Abstract = {{Background Atovaquone and azithromycin (A\&A) with supportive care
   improve survival rates in cats with cytauxzoonosis. Resistance to
   atovaquone via parasite cytochrome b gene (cytb) mutations occurs in
   other Apicomplexan protozoans but is not described in Cytauxzoon felis.
   Objective To serially characterize the C. felis cytb sequences from a
   cat that remained persistently infected after A\&A treatment.
   Animal A cat with naturally occurring C. felis infection.
   Methods Case report of the anemic cat persistently infected with C.
   felis before, during and after A\&A treatment. Cytauxzoon felis cytb
   genes were amplified and sequenced before, during and after A\&A
   treatment.
   Results Cytauxzoon felis was detected before, during and after A\&A
   treatment including samples collected 570 days after treatment. After
   A\&A treatment, the cat's anemia improved slightly. Cytb sequencing
   revealed only wild-type cytb methionine (M128) in samples collected
   before treatment. In samples collected after treatment, the cytb coded
   for isoleucine (M128I) and valine (M128I) at 2- and 4-months after
   treatment. These M128I and M128V mutations persisted even after a repeat
   treatment course with a higher dose atovaquone combined with the
   standard dose of azithromycin.
   Conclusions and Clinical Importance This report documents C. felis
   atovaquone resistance associated with M128 cytb mutations. This study
   suggests parasites with mutations of cytb M128 can be selected and
   impart resistance to A\&A treatment even with higher atovaquone dosing.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{S-matrix elements in flat space can be obtained from a large AdS-radius
   limit of certain CFT correlators. We present a method for constructing
   CFT operators which create incoming and outgoing scattering states in
   flat space. This is done by taking the flat limit of bulk operator
   reconstruction techniques. Using this method, we obtain explicit
   expressions for incoming and outgoing U(1) gauge fields. Weinberg soft
   photon theorems then follow from Ward identites of conserved CFT
   currents. In four bulk dimensions, gauge fields on AdS can be quantized
   with standard and alternative boundary conditions. Changing the
   quantization scheme corresponds to the S-transformation of SL(2, Z)
   electric-magnetic duality in the bulk. This allows us to derive both,
   the electric and magnetic soft photon theorems in flat space from CFT

Title = {{Development and initial implementation of electronic clinical decision
   supports for recognition and management of hospital-acquired acute
   kidney injury}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{Background Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in hospitalized patients
   and is associated with poor patient outcomes and high costs of care. The
   implementation of clinical decision support tools within electronic
   medical record (EMR) could improve AKI care and outcomes. While clinical
   decision support tools have the potential to enhance recognition and
   management of AKI, there is limited description in the literature of how
   these tools were developed and whether they meet end-user expectations.
   Methods We developed and evaluated the content, acceptability, and
   usability of electronic clinical decision support tools for AKI care.
   Multi-component tools were developed within a hospital EMR (Sunrise
   Clinical Manager (TM), Allscripts Healthcare Solutions Inc.) currently
   deployed in Calgary, Alberta, and included: AKI stage alerts, AKI
   adverse medication warnings, AKI clinical summary dashboard, and an AKI
   order set. The clinical decision support was developed for use by
   multiple healthcare providers at the time and point of care on general
   medical and surgical units. Functional and usability testing for the
   alerts and clinical summary dashboard was conducted via in-person
   evaluation sessions, interviews, and surveys of care providers. Formal
   user acceptance testing with clinical end-users, including physicians
   and nursing staff, was conducted to evaluate the AKI order set. Results
   Considerations for appropriate deployment of both non-disruptive and
   interruptive functions was important to gain acceptability by
   clinicians. Functional testing and usability surveys for the alerts and
   clinical summary dashboard indicated that the tools were operating as
   desired and 74\% (17/23) of surveyed healthcare providers reported that
   these tools were easy to use and could be learned quickly. Over
   three-quarters of providers (18/23) reported that they would utilize the
   tools in their practice. Three-quarters of the participants (13/17) in
   user acceptance testing agreed that recommendations within the order set
   were useful. Overall, 88\% (15/17) believed that the order set would
   improve the care and management of AKI patients. Conclusions Development
   and testing of EMR-based decision support tools for AKI with clinicians
   led to high acceptance by clinical end-users. Subsequent implementation
   within clinical environments will require end-user education and
   engagement in system-level initiatives to use the tools to improve care.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives To investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of SMS
   rs-EPI for evaluating breast lesions.
   Methods This prospective study was approved by IRB. Ninety-six patients
   had 102 histopathologically verified lesions (80 malignant and 22
   benign) that were evaluated. Conventional rs-EPI and SMS rs-EPI data
   were acquired on a 3T scanner. Mean kurtosis (MK), mean diffusion (MD),
   and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were quantitatively
   calculated for each lesion on both sequences. Images were qualitatively
   and quantitatively analyzed with respect to image sharpness, geometric
   distortion, lesion conspicuity, anatomic structure, overall image
   quality, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR).
   Student's t test, Pearson correlation, receiver operating characteristic
   curve, Wilcoxon rank sum test, and paired-sample t tests were used for
   statistical analysis.
   Results Compared to conventional rs-EPI, the acquisition time of SMS
   rs-EPI was markedly reduced (2:17 min vs 4:27 min). Pearson's
   correlations showed excellent linear relationships for each parameter
   between conventional rs-EPI and SMS rs-EPI (MK, r = 0.908; MD, r =
   0.938; and ADC, r = 0.975; p < 0.01 for all). Furthermore, SMS rs-EPI
   had similar diagnostic performance compared with conventional rs-EPI.
   SMS rs-EPI had comparable visual image quality as conventional rs-EPI,
   with excellent inter-reader reliability (ICC = 0.851-0.940). No
   differences existed between conventional rs-EPI and SMS rs-EPI for
   either SNR or CNR (p > 0.05).
   Conclusions Applying the SMS technique can significantly reduce the
   acquisition time and produce similar diagnostic accuracy while
   generating comparable image quality as the conventional rs-EPI.
   Key Points
   SMS rs-EPI reduces scan time from 4:27 min to 2:17 min compared with
   conventional rs-EPI.
   SMS rs-EPI has a comparable diagnostic performance to conventional
   rs-EPI in the differentiation between malignant and benign breast
   lesions.
   SMS rs-EPI demonstrates comparable image quality to conventional rs-EPI
   with shorter scan time.}},

   Tersoff potential. It is found that the plastic deformation of SC-cBN
   under nano-indentation is mainly attributed to serial dislocation
   behaviors, such as the formation of dislocation embryos, shear loops,
   and prismatic loops. In comparison, for NT-cBN, the plastic behavior is
   much more complex, which is influenced by a dislocation blockage,
   absorption, dissociation, and re-nucleation due to the interaction
   between dislocations and twin boundaries (TBs). From the plastic
   deformation mechanism of NT-cBN, it is found that the size-dependent
   hardening behavior of NT-cBN is a competitive result between the
   hardening sources, including slip transfer, dislocation accumulation,
   and suppression of dislocation nucleation, and the softening sources,
   including TBs being destroyed, parallel slips of dislocations, and the
   formation of new sites for dislocation nucleation. The smaller the
   distance between the adjacent TBs, the more dominant the role of
   hardening sources is, resulting in the high size-dependent hardness of
   NT-cBN. The results in this paper should be helpful for the optimized
   design of high strength and toughness of nano-structured cBN ceramics.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose
   This paper aims to explore the future of work by investigating how work
   can be practiced to meet global sustainability goals. The authors draw
   from empirical findings from a case of critical design session with
   university students. The aim of the design session was, on the one hand,
   to embed sustainability into education and, on the other hand, to
   prepare students with necessary conceptual tools to be prepared for
   future work. The research questions explored are: What do students learn
   through engagement in critical design, and how can that foster
   sustainable work?
   Design/methodology/approach
   The research approach is a case study, drawing on critical design
   activities with 45 students at a university course. The data consists of
   students' reflections on their design efforts and one researcher's field
   notes from the design session.
   Findings
   The findings show that the students engaged in critical design learn
   different aspects of sustainable work: how to be solution oriented, how
   to use technology to do good in the world and outside-the-box thinking
   skills.
   Originality/value
   The authors contribute extended insight into what it means to work for
   sustainable development, hence doing sustainable work, and how
   sustainable work can be conducted in practice. The authors discuss three
   dimensions of sustainable work that we argue are essential to understand
   how professionals can work towards increased sustainability. The three
   dimensions are: participation-based work, practice-based work and
   context-based work.}},

   and its effect on physicochemical properties and antioxidant activities}},

Abstract = {{Dietary fibers (DFs) and associated phytochemicals in ginseng species
   are known to provide various functional and health benefits. The
   incorporation of ginseng insoluble dietary fiber (IDF) in food products
   often result in undesirable physicochemical properties. Thus, to
   overcome such demerits, micronization of IDF has been considered. This
   study investigated the effect of particle size on the physicochemical
   properties, antioxidant activities, structure and thermal analysis of
   ginseng IDF. Micronized IDF powder with median particle diameter of
   15.83 mu m was produced through fine grinding. Reduction of ginseng IDF
   resulted in increased brightness, water holding capacity and solubility.
   Decreasing particle sizes also lowered bulk, tapped density, Carr index
   and Hausner ratio. Reduction of particle size caused greater
   extractability of mineral and phenolic content and thereby increasing
   the DPPH radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing antioxidant
   power. Increased polyphenol extraction with smaller particle size also
   lowered the mice erythrocytes hemolysis percentage while the hemolysis
   inhibition rate was increased. Particle size also influenced the thermal
   stability of ginseng IDF powders. FTIR spectra revealed lack of impact
   on the major phenolic structures due to superfine grinding.
   Hence,micronized ginseng IDF powders with improved physicochemical
   properties and antioxidant activities possess the potential to be used
   in food and pharmaceutical industries.}},

Abstract = {{Key message Investigation of resource availability on allele effects for
   four yield component quantitative trait loci provides guidance for the
   improvement of grain yield in high and low yielding environments. A
   greater understanding of grain yield (GY) and yield component traits in
   spring wheat may increase selection efficiency for improved GY in high
   and low yielding environments. The objective of this study was to
   determine allelic response of four yield component quantitative trait
   loci (QTL) to variable resource levels which were manipulated by varying
   intraspecific plant competition and seeding density. The four QTL
   investigated in this study had been previously identified as impacting
   specific yield components. They included QTn.mst-6B for productive
   tiller number (PTN), WAPO-A1 for spikelet number per spike (SNS), and
   QGw.mst-3B and TaGW2-A1 for kernel weight (KWT). Near-isogenic lines for
   each of the four QTL were grown in multiple locations with three
   competition (border, no-border and space-planted) and two seeding
   densities (normal 216 seeds m(-2) and low 76 seeds m(-2)). Allele
   response at QTn.mst-6B was driven by changes in resource availability,
   whereas allele response at WAPO-A1 and TaGW2-A1 was relatively
   unaffected by resource availability. The QTn.mst-6B.1 allele at
   QTn.mst-6B conferred PTN plasticity resulting in significant GY
   increases in high resource environments. The gw2-A1 allele at TaGW2-A1
   significantly increased KWT, SNS and GPC offering a source of GY
   improvement without negatively impacting end-use quality. QGw.mst-3B
   allelic variation did not significantly impact KWT but did significantly
   impact SPS. Treatment effects in both experiments often resulted in
   significant positive impacts on GY and yield component traits when
   resource availability was increased. Results provide guidance for
   leveraging yield component QTL to improve GY performance in high- and
   low-yield environments.}},

Abstract = {{The major hazard in open pit mining is ground movement resulting from
   the instability of the mining slopes. Among the factors that influence
   slope instability, external loads from earthquake and rainfall are of
   serious concern. In this paper, the conventional and numerical methods
   of slope stability study have been used to investigate the stability of
   the designed mining slopes and subsequent optimization of the slope
   parameters at Tanjiashan mine in P.R. China. The mine is on a rugged
   terrain with complex geology having bedded rock strata with highly
   developed joints. The simulation to understand the stability of the
   overall slope (before and after mining) was explored using UDEC software
   by considering four working conditions: natural, natural + earthquake,
   heavy rainfall, and heavy rainfall +earthquake. Rocscience DIPS software
   was used for the kinematic feasibility study to determine the failure
   mechanisms in the slope forming rock masses. SLIDE and SWEDGE software
   were used to determine the factor of safety for expected sliding and
   wedge sliding blocks and subsequent optimization of step slope angles in
   the different slope forming rock masses. It was established that the
   overall natural slope is stable. However, the overall mining slope is
   not stable due to the steepness of the step slopes which allow for the
   bedding planes (planes of weakness) to daylight on the slope faces. The
   compression shear bi-planar sliding is the potential failure mechanism.
   The optimization of the step slopes angles by rock formation resolved
   the instability problem on the overall mining slope.}},

Abstract = {{Initiation and evolution of fatigue cracks at the interfaces in
   three-layer Zr-Ti/Zr-Steel composites is herein examined by in situ
   optical microscopy for the first time. Specimens cut out from three
   composite plates comprising Zr 700, Ti Gr. 1, and P265GH steel layers
   have been subjected to uniaxial fatigue cyclic loading. It is found that
   mechanical property mismatch between layers and defects at the
   interfaces can reduce the fatigue life of composite plates. An insight
   into the evolution of cracks initiated at the interfaces reveals that
   (1) most of the cracks grow into adjacent layers along two distinct
   planes, and (2) these cracks could lead to the fatigue failure of
   composites. One of these planes coincides with the adiabatic shear band
   orientation found in Ti Gr. 1 and Zr 700 layers. The interfaces in
   multilayer metallic composite could have excellent fatigue strength
   depending on their structural properties.}},

Abstract = {{Background Professional competencies such as declarative and procedural
   knowledge are essential for career success of physiotherapists. In
   Germany, future physiotherapists learn these competencies in vocational
   training, part-time, dual or primary qualifying studies. Besides
   professional competencies, several extracurricular competencies such as
   sociability are also deemed relevant for career success. Research in
   industrial and organizational psychology shows that a good person job
   fit may yield many positive outcomes for professionals as well as
   vocational training centers and employers. Objective To identify
   possible differences in extracurricular skills between future
   physiotherapists and the general population. It was expected that future
   physiotherapists are aware of job demands and apply only when their
   needs and preferences match these demands. Method Gathering data from
   five vocational training centers from the private sector. Core
   personality dispositions and motives were assessed with two
   questionnaires. Scores for trainees (N=256) were compared with a sample
   representative of the German general population. Results Substantial
   differences between the two samples were found, which correspond to the
   occupational profile of physiotherapists. Trainees displayed higher
   scores for social contact, extraversion, agreeableness, social
   engagement, and physical exercise, and lower scores for revanche.
   Conclusion Based on our results, we conclude that extracurricular
   competencies should be consider in personnel selection of future
   physiotherapists.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous studies have investigated the effects of prewriting tasks on
   writing quality and language (e.g., individual vs. collaborative
   planning, text-chat vs. face-to-face {[}FTF] discussion, etc.). Recent
   meta-analyses have found a small advantage for text chat on writing, but
   no studies involved logographic languages, for which character learning
   may limit and tax language production. In this study we explore this
   issue, as university learners of Chinese (N = 10) engaged in prewriting
   discussions orally and via text chat followed by a timed-writing task.
   Results show that during FTF planning, students engaged in talk that was
   greater in terms of discussion length and number of turns; in students'
   writing, FTF planning resulted in increased lexical complexity and
   syntactic richness. Our results contradict theoretical perspectives
   suggesting that text chat might be more advantageous, as well as one
   empirical study by Liao. Finally, we discuss the implications for
   learning to write in a non-alphabetic language.}},

Abstract = {{Supercapacitor fibers, with short charging times, long cycle lifespans,
   and high power densities, hold promise for powering flexible
   fabric-based electronics. To date, however, only short lengths of
   functioning fiber supercapacitors have been produced. The primary goal
   of this study is to introduce a supercapacitor fiber that addresses the
   remaining challenges of scalability, flexibility, cladding
   impermeability, and performance at length. This is achieved through a
   top-down fabrication method in which a macroscale preform is thermally
   drawn into a fully functional energy-storage fiber. The preform consists
   of five components: thermally reversible porous electrode and
   electrolyte gels; conductive polymer and copper microwire current
   collectors; and an encapsulating hermetic cladding. This process
   produces 100 m of continuous functional supercapacitor fiber, orders of
   magnitude longer than any previously reported. In addition to
   flexibility (5 mm radius of curvature), moisture resistance (100 washing
   cycles), and strength (68 MPa), these fibers have an energy density of
   306 mu Wh cm(-2) at 3.0 V and approximate to 100\% capacitance retention
   over 13 000 cycles at 1.6 V. To demonstrate the utility of this fiber,
   it is machine-woven and used as filament for 3D printing.}},

Volume = {{798}},

Abstract = {{The effects of added Mg on cluster formation and two-step aging behavior
   in Al-Cu(-Mg) alloys were investigated using differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC), Vickers hardness test, transmission electron
   microscope (TEM) and three dimensional atom probe (3DAP). When Mg was
   added to Al-Cu alloys, cluster formation was accelerated because Mg
   lowered formation temperature. Clusters with Mg/(Mg + Cu) values of 0.1,
   0.4 and 0.5 predominantly formed in 40C5M, 40C10 M and 40C15 M alloys,
   respectively. The dominant cluster size was determined to be 0.5 nm
   regardless of the Mg content. The growth behavior of clusters in the
   Al-Cu alloys during natural aging was rarely affected, even though the
   chemical composition inside the clusters was changed by the amount of
   Mg. It was found that clusters formed during natural aging partially
   dissolved during two-step aging at 170 degrees C. The relationship
   between the thermal stability of the clusters and the decrease in
   hardness at the initial stage of two-step aging was clarified.
   Importantly, it was determined that the thermal stability of clusters is
   affected by the interatomic structure of the cluster, rather than its
   size, based on 3DAP analyses. The peak hardness of Al-Cu alloys after
   two-step aging significantly decreased when the amount of added Mg
   exceeded a certain threshold. Thermally stable clusters formed during
   natural aging do not directly transform into precipitates during
   two-step aging in Al-Cu-Mg alloys.}},

Abstract = {{Concentrated solid solutions including the class of high entropy alloys
   (HEAs) have attracted enormous attention recently. Among these alloys a
   recently developed face-centered cubic (fcc) equiatomic VCoNi alloy

   distortions had been reported in the VCoNi solid solution. There is,
   however, a lack of knowledge about potential short-range order (SRO) and
   its implications for most of these alloys. We performed first-principles
   calculations and Monte Carlo simulations to compute the degree of SRO
   for fcc VCoNi, namely, by utilizing the coherent-potential approximation
   in combination with the generalized perturbation method as well as the
   supercell method in combination with recently developed machine-learned
   potentials. We analyze the chemical SRO parameters as well as the impact
   on other properties such as relaxation energies and lattice distortions.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to examine the quality characteristics of
   extruded red Jasmine rice flour (RJF) noodle that had been prepared with
   hydrocolloids, namely guar gum (GG), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), and
   xanthan gum (XG) at the concentrations of 0.0 (control sample), 0.2, and
   0.4\% (w/w), respectively. The use of hydrocolloids had no effect on
   total phenolic contents, antioxidant properties (DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP),
   color, and X-ray diffraction patterns (p > 0.05). In contrast, the
   hydrocolloids tended to increase the expansion ration of the noodle. GG
   and CMC improved cooking, textural, and sensory properties. Ultimately,
   0.2\%-GG showed the lowest cooking loss (5.07\%) when compared with
   others. Moreover, it also provided the noodle with better textural
   properties such as tensile strength, extensibility, hardness,
   cohesiveness, and chewiness (p < 0.05). For these reasons, the highest
   acceptability (6.75) for the noodle was achieved with GG02. XG resulted
   in lower overall acceptability (5.05), particularly the 0.4\%-XG recipe
   (p < 0.05). Thus, usage of 0.2\%-GG was the best option for improving
   the qualities of extruded RJF noodle. XG was deemed ineffective for
   improving the noodle.}},

Title = {{Family changes and residential mobility among immigrant and native-born
   populations: Evidence from Swiss administrative data}},
Journal = {{DEMOGRAPHIC RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{1199-1234}},
Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   Much of the literature on immigrant relocation has focused on human and
   social capital and has often ignored the role of life-course events as
   triggers of internal migration and residential mobility. We know that
   family transitions are closely tied to residential relocation, but the
   extent to which they might explain differential mobility patterns among
   immigrant and native-born populations is still largely unknown.
   OBJECTIVE/METHODS
   Using Swiss administrative registers and a nationally representative
   survey, we apply discrete-time logistic models to assess whether
   residential mobility responses to family changes differ between
   immigrant and native-born populations. We highlight various patterns of
   housing adjustment at times of childbirth, marriage (among cohabiting
   and non-cohabiting partners), and divorce. We also investigate the
   factors accounting for the differences between foreign- and native-born
   groups.
   RESULTS/CONTRIBUTIONS
   The results suggest that residential mobility increases at times of
   childbirth, marriage, and divorce for both native- and foreign-born
   populations living in Switzerland. The results also suggest that the
   timing and intensity of residential changes in response to (or in
   anticipation of) family transitions differ across groups according to
   their birthplace. Compared to native-born residents, immigrants prove to
   be more residentially mobile at the time of marriage, owing to specific
   pre-marital cohabitation behaviours, but less residentially mobile at
   the time of childbirth, an event inherently linked to housing
   improvement. Household income was identified as an important mitigating
   factor within the joint processes of family changes and residential
   mobility. We argue that linking residential mobility to life-course
   events and statuses can serve as an alternative, dynamic marker of
   residential integration, preferences, and housing disadvantage among
   immigrant populations.}},

Title = {{Association of Neighborhood Deprivation With Epigenetic Aging Using 4
   Clock Metrics}},
Journal = {{JAMA NETWORK OPEN}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Neighborhood deprivation is associated with age-related
   disease, mortality, and reduced life expectancy. However, biological
   pathways underlying these associations are not well understood.
   OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association between neighborhood deprivation
   and epigenetic measures of age acceleration and genome-wide methylation.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study used data
   from the Sister Study, a prospective cohort study comprising 50 884
   women living in the US and Puerto Rico aged 35 to 74 years at enrollment
   who had a sister with breast cancer but had not had breast cancer
   themselves. Cohort enrollment occurred between July 2003 and March 2009.
   Participants completed a computer-assisted telephone interview on
   demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and residential factors and
   provided anthropometric measures and peripheral blood samples at a home
   examination. DNA methylation data obtained for 2630 non-Hispanic White
   women selected for a case-cohort study in 2014 were used in this
   cross-sectional analysis. DNA methylation was measured using the
   HumanMethylation450 BeadChips in whole blood samples collected at
   baseline. Data analysis for this study was performed from October 17,
   2019, to August 27, 2020.
   EXPOSURES Each participants' primary address was linked to an
   established index of neighborhood deprivation.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Epigenetic age was estimated using 4
   epigenetic clocks (Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge, and GrimAge). Age
   acceleration was determined using residuals from regressing chronologic
   age on each of the 4 epigenetic agemetrics. Linear regression was used
   to estimate associations between neighborhood deprivation and epigenetic
   age acceleration as well as DNA methylation at individual
   cytosine-guanine sites across the genome.
   RESULTS Mean (SD) age of the 2630 participants was 56.9 (8.7) years.
   Those with the greatest (>75th percentile) vs least ( 25th percentile)
   neighborhood deprivation had higher epigenetic age acceleration
   estimated by Hannum (ss = 0.23; 95\% CI, 0.01-0.45), PhenoAge (ss =
   0.28; 95\% CI, 0.06-.50), and GrimAge (ss = 0.37; 95\% CI, 0.12-0.62).
   Increasing US quartiles of neighborhood deprivation exhibited a trend
   with Hannum, PhenoAge, and GrimAge. For example, GrimAge showed a
   significant dose-response (P test for trend <.001) as follows: level 2
   vs level 1 (ss = 0.30; 95\% CI, 0.17-0.42), level 3 vs level 1 (ss =
   0.35; 95\% CI, 0.19-0.50), and level 4 vs level 1 (ss = 0.37; 95\% CI,
   0.12-0.62). Neighborhood deprivation was found to be associated with 3
   cytosine-phosphateguanine sites, with 1 of these annotated to a known
   gene MAOB (P = 9.71 x 10(-08)).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The findings of this study suggest that
   residing in a neighborhood with a higher deprivation index appears to be
   reflected by methylation-based markers of aging.}},

Title = {{GDP volatility implication of tourism volatility in South Africa: A
   time-varying approach}},
Journal = {{TOURISM ECONOMICS}},
Abstract = {{The importance of tourism as one of the bedrocks of economic growth in
   South Africa suggests that volatility in the sector may have dire
   consequences. We therefore empirically analyse the impact of tourism
   volatility (TV) on the gross domestic product (GDP) volatility of the
   country, using time-varying approaches that treat the parameter
   estimations as functions of time, thereby overcoming the challenge posed
   by parameter instabilities, non-linearities, non-stationarity, regime
   shifts and time variations. We find that TV significantly aggravates GDP
   volatility (GDPV) in South Africa. The impact varies from year to year
   and is greatest during the periods characterized by economic turbulence
   and crime and violence against foreigners. The size of the coefficients
   has been on a steady increase over time, reflecting the growing
   importance of tourism and TV to the South African economy. We also find
   that TV is a significant predictor of GDPV in the country. We strongly
   recommend that policymakers pay serious attention to economic happenings
   around the world since TV is one of the channels through which global
   economic crises affect the South African economy. We also recommend that
   the minimization of crime and social disorder should form an essential
   component of tourism development and promotion strategy in South Africa.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of hydrogen addition on the ignition delay time of methyl
   butanoate was studied using a rapid compression machine experiment and
   ANSYS CHEMKIN-PRO 19.0 numerical analysis. The ignition delay was
   measured under engine-relevant conditions by varying equivalence ratios
   (0.5 and 1.0), compression pressures (15 and 30 bar), compression
   temperatures (860-1060 K), and hydrogen mole fractions in the methyl
   butanoate/hydrogen mixture (0\%, 25\%, 50\%, and 75\%). The kinetic
   mechanism was modified by adding the methyl butanoate mechanism to the
   NUIG Aramco 3.0 mechanism and modifying the rate parameters of the
   H-atom abstraction reactions of methyl butanoate. The numerical results
   obtained using the modified mechanism were in good agreement with the
   experimental results. The methyl butanoate/hydrogen mixture did not show
   a negative temperature coefficient characteristic. With hydrogen
   addition, the ignition delay increased at low temperatures but decreased
   at high temperatures. The results of the chemical and dilution effect
   analysis using the imaginary inert H-2 showed that the chemical effects
   differ depending on the temperature. Most added hydrogen molecules
   participate in the chain propagation reactions to produce H radicals and
   consume OH by the reaction H-2 + OH -> H + H2O. This, in turn, changes
   the reactions of other species, such as HO2 and H2O2. The results of the
   reaction path analysis for the related species showed that the addition
   of hydrogen reduced radical reactions at low temperatures, while
   increasing them at high temperatures.}},

Title = {{Constraining Denaturalization}},
Journal = {{POLITICAL STUDIES}},
Abstract = {{Citizenship has been treated, since World War II, as a robust political
   and legal status. Recent political events have prompted the reassessment
   of the conditions under which it can be justly removed, however. Using
   the lens of democratic theory, I consider one particular instance of
   denationalization, namely, the withdrawal of citizenship from
   naturalized citizens when the granting state believes that the applicant
   `misrepresented' themselves, that is, engaged in some form of deception,
   during the process of naturalization. There is an intuitive plausibility
   to the thought that if an applicant for citizenship lies or fails to
   provide all of the requested information, she should be denied
   citizenship. It seems equally plausible that, if citizenship status is
   nevertheless granted under these conditions, it can be permissibly
   removed. However, I argue that this conclusion is too quick: to be
   permissible, denaturalization procedures must be significantly
   constrained, in the ways that I outline.}},

Journal = {{MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR}},

Abstract = {{Background: We investigated the outcomes of displaced intra-articular
   calcaneal fractures (DIACFs) treated by percutaneous reduction and
   hollow screw fixation (PRHCF) versus open reduction and internal
   fixation (ORIF).
   Material/Methods: Seventy-one patients were randomly allocated to group
   A (by PRHCF) and group B (by ORIF). Operative time, visual analogue
   scale (VAS) score, time from injury to operation, postoperative hospital
   stay, preoperative and postoperative radiographic measurements, and
   complications were recorded. Functional outcomes were assessed using the
   American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores.
   Results: Finally, 59 patients were followed up for at least 12 months
   (range, 12-24 months). Group A showed significantly more advantages than
   group B in term of operative time, intraoperative blood loss, time to
   operation, postoperative hospital stay, and postoperative pain relief
   during the first 3 days (P<0.001). However, more intraoperative
   fluoroscopy was required in group A than in group B (P<0.001). The
   calcaneal width, height, length, Bohler angle, and Gissane angle in each
   group were significantly improved postoperatively (all P<0.001),
   although not significantly different in the postoperative comparisons
   between both groups. The AOFAS scores were slightly superior in group A
   than in group B (88.3 vs. 86.4, P=0.08). The rate of incidence of
   postoperative complications was lower in group A than in group B (3.2\%
   vs. 10.8\%, respectively; OR, 0.28, 95\% CI, 0.03 to 2.84), although
   there was no significant difference (P=0.337).
   Conclusions: PRHCF showed comparable clinical and radiological outcomes
   as ORIF, demonstrating it is a safe and effective alternative in
   treating DIACFs.}},

Abstract = {{Helene Cixous delicately reminds us that doors perform a material and
   affective liminality between what is and what might be, and questions
   the reason and rhyme of doors as ways in and out of spaces which denote
   passage and movement; and as structures which separate, connect, and
   demarcate entanglements of being, becoming and belonging on the inside
   or out. In this paper, we take up Cixous' thinking around doors to
   explore literal and metaphorical accounts of the material, embodied and
   affective liminality of doorways and doors within the context of higher
   education. Cixous concept of ``ecriture feminine{''} places experience
   before language, and privileges non-linear, cyclical writing that evades
   the discourse that regulates phallogocentrism. With this in mind, this
   paper is a meta-fictional feminist adaptation of Franz Kafka's parable
   `Before the Law' from his novelThe Trial. This approach draws upon our
   own experiences, as well as qualitative interviews with other academic
   women across Australia to explore the ways that opening and closing
   doors speak to issues of agency and transparency, inequality and
   discrimination, pedagogy and politics in academia, as well as the need
   for a renewed feminist commitment to connectedness and solidarity in a
   highly competitive and critical neoliberal work environment.}},

Abstract = {{Designing biochemical systems that can be effectively used in diverse
   fields, including diagnostics, molecular computing and nanomachines, has
   long been recognized as an important goal of molecular programming and
   DNA nanotechnology. A key issue in the development of such practical
   devices on the nanoscale lies in the development of biochemical
   components with information-processing capacity. In this article, we
   propose a molecular device that utilizes DNA strand displacement
   networks and allows interactive inhibition between two input signals;
   thus, it is termed a cross-inhibitor. More specifically, the device
   supplies each input signal with a processor such that the processing of
   one input signal will interdict the signal of the other. Biochemical
   experiments are conducted to analyze the interdiction performance with
   regard to effectiveness, stability and controllability. To illustrate
   its feasibility, a biochemical framework grounded in this mechanism is
   presented to determine the winner of a tic-tac-toe game. Our results
   highlight the potential for DNA strand displacement cascades to act as
   signal controllers and event triggers to endow molecular systems with
   the capability of controlling and detecting events and signals.}},

Title = {{Evaluating the Real-Time Impact of COVID-19 on Cities: China as a Case
   Study}},
Journal = {{COMPLEXITY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{2020}},
Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Since the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic has dramatically
   influenced the human socioeconomic system. If we conceive of the city as
   a complex organism with a metabolism, then the daily flows of people,
   materials, and information into and out of a city can be regarded as its
   metabolism. To evaluate the real-time impact of COVID-19 on a city's
   economy and society, we construct a health index of cities (HIC) using
   human mobility big data from Baidu and analyze the temporal and spatial
   changes of the HIC in China. The results show that both internal and
   intercity population movements have been significantly affected by the
   COVID-19 epidemic, and the decline in both was more than 50\% at some
   points. The intercity movement is more affected than the intracity
   movement, and the impact is more sustained. Compared with the same
   period before the outbreak, the HIC in China decreased by 28.6\% from
   January 20 to April 21, 2020. The deterioration rate of the HIC was
   faster than the growth rate of COVID-19 cases, but the improvement in
   the HIC was much slower than the decline in COVID-19 cases. Although the
   HIC is highly correlated with COVID-19 in both the spatial and temporal
   dimensions, the effect of the epidemic on the HIC varied across regions.
   The HIC fell more significantly in provincial capitals, such as Beijing,
   Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Zhengzhou, and in urban agglomerations, and
   these cities' HICs were lower with a longer-lasting reduction. This
   study can serve as a frame of reference for studying the real-time
   impact of the epidemic, helping cities' policymakers to quickly assess
   its socioeconomic impact. By extension, this index can be applied to
   other countries and other public health emergencies.}},

Abstract = {{It is challenging to explore and prepare polyoxometalates-based
   nanomaterials (PNMs) with controllable morphologies and diversiform

   and Anderson-type polyoxometalates, CeCdW12 nanoflower and EuCrMo6
   microflaky have been fabricated respectively. A series of control
   experiments are carried out to identify the impact factors on the rare
   morphologies in PNMs. Furthermore, upon excitation at 396 nm, the
   emission spectrum of EuCrMo6 displays five prominent f - f emitting
   peaks at 674, 685, 690, 707, and 734 nm that are assigned to Eu3+ 5D0 ->
   F-7(J) (J = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) transitions. Meanwhile, the VSM results show
   that the Cr+3 ions in EuCrMo6 display anti-ferromagnetic interactions
   when the temperature is lower than - 17.54 K. After rising temperature,
   this material exhibits paramagnetic property. This work opens up
   strategies toward the brand new morphologies and components of PNMs,

   complexes, especially the Cp-xbiph (biphenyl-substituted

   against human lung cancer (A549) cells; the best one (Ir8) was almost
   five times that of cisplatin under the same conditions. Compared with
   complexes involving halide ion leaving groups, the pyridine-based one
   did not display hydrolysis but effectively caused lysosomal damage,
   leading to accumulation in the cytosol, inducing an increase in the
   level of intracellular reactive oxygen species and apoptosis; this
   indicated an anticancer mechanism of oxidation. Additionally, these
   complexes could bind to serum albumin through a static quenching
   mechanism. The data highlight the potential value of half-sandwich

Title = {{Duality and supersymmetry constraints on the weak gravity conjecture}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Positivity bounds coming from consistency of UV scattering amplitudes
   are not always sufficient to prove the weak gravity conjecture for
   theories beyond Einstein-Maxwell. Additional ingredients about the UV
   may be necessary to exclude those regions of parameter space which are
   naively in conflict with the predictions of the weak gravity conjecture.
   In this paper we explore the consequences of imposing additional
   symmetries inherited from the UV theory on higher-derivative operators
   for Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion theory. Using black hole
   thermodynamics, for a preserved SL(2, ) symmetry we find that the weak
   gravity conjecture then does follow from positivity bounds. For a
   preserved O(d, d; ) symmetry we find a simple condition on the two
   Wilson coefficients which ensures the positivity of corrections to the
   charge-to-mass ratio and that follows from the null energy condition
   alone. We find that imposing supersymmetry on top of either of these
   symmetries gives corrections which vanish identically, as expected for
   BPS states.}},

Abstract = {{The Central Asiatisc Region is commonly known as one of the primary
   centers of origin of cultivated plants, especially for apricots,
   cherries, apples, pears, pistachios, almonds, walnuts, and some
   vegetables. However, it lacks exact data and information about
   cultivated plants in this region. A comprehensive introduction and
   analysis will help people understand the status. The methods of
   literature study had been used to collect data from existing references.
   The aim of this study was to provide details of cultivated plants in the
   Central Asiatic Region for conservation and sustainable uses of plant
   genetic resources. As a result, 802 species of cultivated plants from
   107 families and 388 genera were presented according to Mansfeld's
   definition. In addition, 304 wild relatives of cultivated plants and
   several landraces have been recorded in the Central Asiatic Region.
   Remarkably, the region had exported important species of vegetables,
   fruits and nuts to other parts of the world. The Silk Road passed
   through the Central Asiatic Region and had strongly promoted the
   exchange of cultivated plants between the East and the West. Located in
   the key zone of the Belt and Road Initiative, this region will continue
   to make great contributions to the world in terms of conservation,
   breeding, development and use of cultivated plants.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose In this study, we propose a deep learning approach for
   assessment of gallbladder (GB) wall vascularity from images of
   laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Difficulty in the visualization of GB
   wall vessels may be the result of fatty infiltration or increased
   thickening of the GB wall, potentially as a result of cholecystitis or
   other diseases. Methods The dataset included 800 patches and 181 region
   outlines of the GB wall extracted from 53 operations of the Cholec80
   video collection. The GB regions and patches were annotated by two
   expert surgeons using two labeling schemes: 3 classes (low, medium and
   high vascularity) and 2 classes (low vs. high). Two convolutional neural
   network (CNN) architectures were investigated. Preprocessing (vessel
   enhancement) and post-processing (late fusion of CNN output) techniques
   were applied. Results The best model yielded accuracy 94.48\% and
   83.77\% for patch classification into 2 and 3 classes, respectively. For
   the GB wall regions, the best model yielded accuracy 91.16\% (2 classes)
   and 80.66\% (3 classes). The inter-observer agreement was 91.71\% (2
   classes) and 78.45\% (3 classes). Late fusion analysis allowed the
   computation of spatial probability maps, which provided a visual
   representation of the probability for each vascularity class across the
   GB wall region. Conclusions This study is the first significant step
   forward to assess the vascularity of the GB wall from intraoperative
   images based on computer vision and deep learning techniques. The
   classification performance of the CNNs was comparable to the agreement
   of two expert surgeons. The approach may be used for various
   applications such as for classification of LC operations and
   context-aware assistance in surgical education and practice.}},

Abstract = {{Learning of complex auditory sequences such as music can be thought of
   as optimizing an internal model of regularities through unpredicted
   events (or ``prediction errors{''}). We used dynamic causal modeling
   (DCM) and parametric empirical Bayes on functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) data to identify modulation of effective brain
   connectivity that takes place during perceptual learning of complex tone
   patterns. Our approach differs from previous studies in two aspects.
   First, we used a complex oddball paradigm based on tone patterns as
   opposed to simple deviant tones. Second, the use of fMRI allowed us to
   identify cortical regions with high spatial accuracy. These regions
   served as empirical regions-of-interest for the analysis of effective
   connectivity. Deviant patterns induced an increased blood oxygenation
   level-dependent response, compared to standards, in early auditory
   (Heschl's gyrus {[}HG]) and association auditory areas (planum temporale
   {[}PT]) bilaterally. Within this network, we found a left-lateralized
   increase in feedforward connectivity from HG to PT during deviant
   responses and an increase in excitation within left HG. In contrast to
   previous findings, we did not find frontal activity, nor did we find
   modulations of backward connections in response to oddball sounds. Our
   results suggest that complex auditory prediction errors are encoded by
   changes in feedforward and intrinsic connections, confined to superior
   temporal gyrus.}},

Title = {{Circulating bioactive adrenomedullin as a marker of sepsis, septic shock
   and critical illness}},
Journal = {{CRITICAL CARE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{Background Biomarkers can be of help to understand critical illness and
   to identify and stratify sepsis. Adrenomedullin is a vasoactive hormone,
   with reported prognostic and potentially therapeutic value in sepsis.
   The primary aim of this study was to investigate the association of
   circulating bioactive adrenomedullin (bio-ADM) levels at intensive care
   unit (ICU) admission with mortality in sepsis patients and in a general
   ICU population. Secondary aims included the association of bio-ADM with
   organ failure and the ability of bio-ADM to identify sepsis. Methods In
   this retrospective observational study, adult patients admitted to one
   of four ICUs during 2016 had admission bio-ADM levels analysed.
   Age-adjusted odds ratios (OR) with 95\% CI for log-2 transformed
   bio-ADM, and Youden's index derived cut-offs were calculated. The
   primary outcome was 30-day mortality, and secondary outcomes included
   the need for organ support and the ability to identify sepsis. Results
   Bio-ADM in 1867 consecutive patients were analysed; 632 patients
   fulfilled the sepsis-3 criteria of whom 267 had septic shock. The median
   bio-ADM in the entire ICU population was 40 pg/mL, 74 pg/mL in sepsis
   patients, 107 pg/mL in septic shock and 29 pg/mL in non-septic patients.
   The association of elevated bio-ADM and mortality in sepsis patients and
   the ICU population resulted in ORs of 1.23 (95\% CI 1.07-1.41) and 1.22
   (95\% CI 1.12-1.32), respectively. The association with mortality
   remained after additional adjustment for lactate in sepsis patients.
   Elevated bio-ADM was associated with an increased need for dialysis with
   ORs of 2.28 (95\% CI 2.01-2.59) and 1.97 (95\% CI 1.64-2.36) for the ICU
   population and sepsis patients, respectively, and with increased need of
   vasopressors, OR 1.33 (95\% CI 1.23-1.42) (95\% CI 1.17-1.50) for both
   populations. Sepsis was identified with an OR of 1.78 (95\% CI
   1.64-1.94) for bio-ADM, after additional adjustment for severity of
   disease. A bio-ADM cut-off of 70 pg/mL differentiated between survivors
   and non-survivors in sepsis, but a Youden's index derived threshold of
   108 pg/mL performed better. Conclusions Admission bio-ADM is associated
   with 30-day mortality and organ failure in sepsis patients as well as in
   a general ICU population. Bio-ADM may be a morbidity-independent sepsis
   biomarker.}},

Abstract = {{Researchers have examined the effects of individual job-related anxiety
   on employee attitudes and behaviors but have yet to examine whether team
   job-related anxiety would have similar or different effects. Building on
   prior research on negative group affective tone and creativity, we
   propose that team job-related anxiety has an inverted U-shaped
   curvilinear relationship with both team and individual creativity.
   Furthermore, we posit that team cooperativeness moderates those
   curvilinear relationships. Using a two-wave research design and matched
   employee-supervisor data from 290 employees nested in 65 teams, we found
   support for the proposed inverted U-shaped relationships. Moreover, the
   intermediate level of team job-related anxiety was associated with
   higher individual creativity in teams with higher cooperativeness. We
   conclude the study with a discussion of the theoretical and practical
   implications of our findings.}},

Abstract = {{Developing methods for accurate detection of RNA modifications remains a
   major challenge in epitranscriptomics. Next-generation sequencing-based
   mapping approaches have recently emerged but, often, they are not
   quantitative and lack specificity. Pseudouridine (psi), produced by
   uridine isomerization, is one of the most abundant RNA modification. psi
   mapping classically involves derivatization with soluble carbodiimide
   (CMCT), which is prone to variation making this approach only
   semi-quantitative. Here, we developed `HydraPsiSeq', a novel
   quantitative psi mapping technique relying on specific protection from
   hydrazine/aniline cleavage. HydraPsiSeq is quantitative because the
   obtained signal directly reflects pseudouridine level. Furthermore,
   normalization to natural unmodified RNA and/or to synthetic in vitro
   transcripts allows absolute measurements of modification levels.
   HydraPsiSeq requires minute amounts of RNA (as low as 10-50 ng), making
   it compatible with high-throughput profiling of diverse biological and
   clinical samples. Exploring the potential of HydraPsiSeq, we profiled
   human rRNAs, revealing strong variations in pseudouridylation levels at
   similar to 20-25 positions out of total 104 sites. We also observed the
   dynamics of rRNA pseudouridylation throughout chondrogenic
   differentiation of human bone marrow stem cells. In conclusion,
   HydraPsiSeq is a robust approach for the systematic mapping and accurate
   quantification of pseudouridines in RNAs with applications in disease,
   aging, development, differentiation and/or stress response.}},

Abstract = {{Pivotal within quantum physics, the concept of quantum incompatibility
   is generally related to algebraic aspects of the formalism, such as
   commutation relations and unbiasedness of bases. Recently, the concept
   was identified as a resource in tasks involving quantum state
   discrimination and quantum programmability. Here, we link quantum
   incompatibility with the amount of information that can be extracted
   from a system upon successive measurements of noncommuting observables,
   a scenario related to communication tasks. This approach leads us to
   characterize incompatibility as a resource encoded in a physical
   context, which involves both the quantum state and observables.
   Moreover, starting with a measure of context incompatibility we derive a
   measurement-incompatibility quantifier that is easily computable, admits
   a geometrical interpretation, and is maximum only if the eigenbases of
   the involved observables are mutually unbiased.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Most Japanese institutions screen for post-partum depression (PPD)
   using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at outpatient
   visits conducted at 2- and 4-week post-partum, but there are no
   published data on the usefulness of EPDS scores 2-week post-partum. In
   the present study, relationships between 2-week post-partum EPDS scores
   and 4-week post-partum EPDS scores were investigated to determine
   whether 2-week scores may facilitate early intervention in high-risk
   mothers.
   Methods A retrospective analysis of 451 deliveries from 2017 to 2019 was
   conducted at a single institution. EPDS scores were obtained using the
   Japanese EPDS 2- and 4-week post-partum, in conjunction with other
   perinatal data from medical records.
   Results In total, 334 of 451 mothers (74.1\%) completed the EPDS at both
   2- and 4-week post-partum and were included in the analysis. Of 48 who
   had higher scores 2-week post-partum, 21 (43.8\%) continued to be at
   high risk of PPD. Of 284 who had lower scores 2-week post-partum, 9
   (3.2\%) transitioned to scores indicating high risk. Women considered
   high-risk 4-week post-partum tended to have exhibited higher scores
   2-week post-partum. Women who had experienced more deliveries tended to
   exhibit lower scores, and psychiatric illness was strongly associated
   with higher EPDS scores (odds ratio 11.2, 95\% confidence interval
   3.7-33.8, P < 0.01).
   Conclusion Two-week EPDS scores closely reflected 4-week scores, and may
   facilitate early intervention to prevent PPD. Primiparous mothers and
   those with a history of psychiatric illness should be followed-up
   closely.}},

Title = {{Adapting the reverse pyramid airplane boarding method for social
   distancing in times of COVID-19}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Social distancing resulting from the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) has
   disrupted the airplane boarding process. Social distancing norms reduce
   airplane capacity by keeping the middle seats unoccupied, while an
   imposed aisle social distance between boarding passengers slows the
   boarding. Recent literature suggests the Reverse Pyramid boarding method
   is a promising way to reduce health risk and keep boarding times low
   when 10 apron buses (essentially 10 boarding groups) are used to
   transport passengers from the airport terminal to a two-door airplane.
   We adapt the Reverse Pyramid method for social distancing when an
   airplane is boarded using a jet bridge that connects the terminal the
   airplane's front door. We vary the number of boarding groups from two to
   six and use stochastic simulation and agent-based modelling to show the
   resulting impact on four performance evaluation metrics. Increasing the
   number of boarding groups from two to six reduces boarding time only up
   to four groups but continues to reduce infection risk up to six groups.
   If the passengers carry fewer luggage aboard the airplane, health risks
   (as well as boarding times) decrease. One adaptation of the Reverse
   Pyramid (RP) method (RP-Spread) provides slightly faster boarding times
   than the other (RP-Steep), when luggage volumes are high, while RP-Steep
   results in less risk to window seat passengers from later-boarding
   passengers walking by their row. Increasing the minimum aisle social
   distance from 1 m to 2 m increases boarding times but results in lower
   health risks to passengers walking down the aisle and to the previously
   seated passengers they pass.}},

Abstract = {{Lowering of prion protein (PrP) expression in the brain is a genetically
   validated therapeutic hypothesis in prion disease. We recently showed
   that antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-mediated PrP suppression extends
   survival and delays disease onset in intracerebrally prion-infected mice
   in both prophylactic and delayed dosing paradigms. Here, we examine the
   efficacy of this therapeutic approach across diverse paradigms, varying
   the dose and dosing regimen, prion strain, treatment timepoint, and
   examining symptomatic, survival, and biomarker readouts. We recapitulate
   our previous findings with additional PrP-targeting ASOs, and
   demonstrate therapeutic benefit against four additional prion strains.
   We demonstrate that <25\% PrP suppression is sufficient to extend
   survival and delay symptoms in a prophylactic paradigm. Rise in both
   neuroinflammation and neuronal injury markers can be reversed by a
   single dose of PrP-lowering ASO administered after the detection of
   pathological change. Chronic ASO-mediated suppression of PrP beginning
   at any time up to early signs of neuropathology confers benefit similar
   to constitutive heterozygous PrP knockout. Remarkably, even after
   emergence of frank symptoms including weight loss, a single treatment
   prolongs survival by months in a subset of animals. These results
   support ASO-mediated PrP lowering, and PrP-lowering therapeutics in
   general, as a promising path forward against prion disease.}},

Abstract = {{My aim is to identify the general and specific patterns in the
   geographical distribution of sable, Martes zibellina, and pine marten,
   Martes martes, sizes, as well as one sibling species in the general
   range. For each species, a comparative analysis of the response to
   environmental gradients in different areas of their ranges was carried
   out. For the range of each species, as for the twin species, the global
   trend presented an increase in size from the Pacific to the Atlantic,
   which revealed a negative longitudinal trend that was more pronounced in
   the marten. The sable follows Bergmann's rule, whereas the marten
   demonstrates a significant reverse trend. As a species, the marten shows
   a significant clinal growth that is directly correlated to the increase
   in the average annual temperatures and January temperatures, as well as
   with increased elevation (without any reaction to the July
   temperatures). As a species, the sable does not correlate with the
   temperature or elevation gradients. New and diverse patterns of sable
   and marten sizes across Eurasia were identified. The two species
   demonstrate the existence of a single zone of minimum sizes in the
   entire range, and there is a new feature of the growth to the east of
   the zone where the dimensions are minimal. The marten is adapted to a
   temperate climate, whereas the sable is adapted to cold and extreme
   climates. I have proposed several corrections to the conservation plans
   based on knowledge of the biological characteristics of the marten and
   sable populations and subspecies.}},

Abstract = {{Neural crest cells (NCCs) are highly migratory multipotent cells that
   play critical roles in embryogenesis. The generation of NCCs is
   controlled by various transcription factors (TFs) that are regulated by
   each other and combine to form a regulatory network. We previously
   reported that the conversion of mouse fibroblasts into NCCs was achieved
   by the overexpression of only one TF, Sox10; therefore, Sox10 may be a
   powerful inducer of the conversion of NCCs. We herein investigated
   whether Sox10 functions in the direct conversion of other somatic cells
   into NCCs. Sox10 directly converted bone marrow-derived mesenchymal
   cells, but not keratinocytes, into P75+ NCCs. However, by the
   co-expression of four TFs (Snail1, Snail2, Twist1, and Tcfap2a) that are
   involved in NCC generation, but unable convert cells into NCCs, Sox10
   converted keratinocytes into P75+ NCCs. P75+ NCCs mainly differentiated
   into glial cells, and to a lesser extent into neuronal cells. On the
   other hand, when Sox10 was expressed after the four TF expression, which
   mimicked the expression order in in vivo NCC generation, it converted
   keratinocytes into multipotent NCCs. These results demonstrate that
   Sox10 functions as an inducer of direct conversion into NCCs in
   cooperation with the TFs involved in NCC generation. The sequence of
   expression of the inducer and cooperative factors is important for the
   conversion of somatic cells into bona fide target cells.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we report a fast fabrication process of nanocomposites with better
   electrical properties by intermixing graphene oxide (GO) and low ammonia
   natural rubber latex (NRL) polymer via the one-step method (similar to x
   10(-5) to x 10(-7) S cm(-1)). In comparison, the nanocomposite
   synthesized by the two-step method demonstrated lower electrical
   properties which were calculated to be x 10(-7) S cm(-1). Obviously, the
   increase in the electrolyte concentrations from 0.01 to 0.1 M SDS did
   not influenced the electrical conductivity which means the fabrication
   process also played a role in a successful dispersion of GO in NRL
   polymer. The electrical testing was carried out by four-point probe
   instrument and cyclic voltammograms in the range of 0-1 V were measured
   at various scan rates for all samples using a computerized
   potentiostat-galvanostat equipped with Gamry software (Gamry
   potentiostat series-G750, USA). Among all nanocomposite samples, 0.01 M
   SDS-GO/NRL nanocomposite synthesized via one-step method successfully
   showed higher capacitance performance which found to be 107 F g(-1).}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the application of ethical thinking from the
   perspective of someone with the dual role of social worker and PhD
   researcher. The focus of the research was family secrets and their
   influence upon child-to-parent violence and abuse (CPVA). The
   participants were children and their parents, who, at the time of the
   research, were experiencing family violence and abuse.
   This paper was developed from a conversation between Lee-Ann and Louise.
   Lee-Ann was Louise's PhD supervisor and was therefore involved in
   supporting Louise in gaining ethics approval, as well as holding
   continued reflexive conversations about the ethical questions and
   dilemmas that arose throughout this study.
   This paper has shown the importance of hearing the voices of children
   within research about CPVA. Children can offer a rich layer of
   information that is seldom heard. It also shows that there may be a
   different lens through which ethics can be considered during research,
   not only the purely objective or academic, but also from a
   practitioner-researcher in a social care setting position.}},

Abstract = {{Tuberculosis verrucosa cutis is a paucibacillary form of cutaneous
   tuberculosis that often occurs in sensitized immunocompetent individuals
   due to exogenous reinfection. The diagnosis is often difficult because
   the clinical features are often not typical and acid-fast staining test
   often shows negative results. Therapeutic trial with antituberculosis
   therapy is justified if there is strong clinical suspicion in which
   diagnosis can be made based on the therapeutic response. We report a
   46-year-old male with erythematous verrucous plaque on the right knee
   and crusted erythematous plaque on the left dorsal foot that had been
   present for 20 years. There were neither history of previous trauma nor
   tuberculosis treatment. Histopathology, culture, polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR), Mantoux test, and chest radiograph were negative for
   cutaneous tuberculosis. Gamma release interferon assay showed positive
   result. The patient was given category 1 antituberculosis treatment and
   showed improvement after three weeks. Treatment was continued for 6
   months and the lesion significantly regressed.}},

Abstract = {{The bunching of steps at the surface of growing and sublimating crystals
   can be induced by both directions of the electromigration force acting
   on the adatoms, step-up and step-down. The processes happen in different
   intervals of the adatom concentration and differ in character. In this
   modeling study, we show that the overall picture of the bunching process
   changes entirely when steps cannot overlap, thus forming macrosteps. The
   step-step exclusion rule that forbids the steps to coalesce is
   introduced in our atomistic scale model of vicinal crystal growth, and
   we show how it distinguishes between the step-up and step-down
   directions of the destabilizing diffusional bias; the model surface
   destabilized by the step-up driving force smoothens, while the surface
   destabilized by the step-down driving force changes its character from
   vertical (01)-faceted macrosteps toward regular (11)-faceted bunches. We
   also clearly demonstrate how the step-step exclusion switches on another
   second length scale next to the bunch height, that is the bunch width,
   instead of the macrostep height. The bunch profiles, stability diagrams,
   and time-scaling dependences of the bunch properties are heavily
   affected by the step-step exclusion, and we quantify this effect by
   showing how it changes the overall scaling behavior of the phenomenon.
   Making step-step exclusion conditional by introducing a probability for
   exclusion brings additional features, and a new characteristic time
   scale emerges as an effect of the interplay between (01)-faceted
   macrosteps and (11)-faceted bunches.}},

Abstract = {{Objective This study was undertaken to identify novel autoantibodies in
   axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) and determine their diagnostic potential
   in patients with early axial SpA and controls from 2 independent
   cohorts.
   Methods An axial SpA complementary DNA phage display library was used to
   screen for novel IgG antibodies in plasma from patients with early axial
   SpA. The presence of these antibodies against novel peptides (i.e.,
   peptides identified in an early axial SpA cohort from Hasselt
   University, designated UH-axSpA) was determined by enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay in 76 patients with early axial SpA, 75 controls
   with nonspecific chronic low back pain, 60 patients with rheumatoid
   arthritis, and 94 healthy controls from the UH cohort. Antibody
   reactivity to these novel peptides was further validated in 174 patients
   with axial SpA (of whom 79 had early axial SpA) from the University
   Hospitals Leuven (Bio)SPAR (Spondyloarthritis {[}Biologics]) cohort.
   Results We identified antibodies to 9 novel UH-axSpA peptides,
   corresponding to randomly formed peptides and to a novel axial SpA
   autoantigen, double homeobox protein 4. Antibodies to 3 UH-axSpA
   peptides with the highest positive likelihood ratio (LR) for a diagnosis
   of axial SpA were present in significantly more patients with early
   axial SpA from the UH and (Bio)SPAR cohorts (14.2\% {[}22/155]) compared
   to controls with chronic low back pain (5\% {[}4/75]), resulting in 95\%
   specificity. The positive LR for confirming axial SpA using antibodies
   to these 3 UH-axSpA peptides was 2.7, which is higher than the LR
   obtained with the currently used laboratory marker C-reactive protein.
   Testing for antibodies to these 3 UH-axSpA peptides in patients with
   chronic low back pain increased the posttest probability of a diagnosis
   of axial SpA from 79\% to 91\%.
   Conclusion Antibodies to 3 UH-axSpA peptides could provide a novel tool
   in the diagnosis of a subset of axial SpA patients.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundLeptin can have a direct effect on endothelial and vascular
   smooth muscle cells and high level of leptin is involved in the
   pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. This study aimed to determine the
   relationship between leptin/adiponectin (L/A) ratio and the extent and
   severity of coronary artery disease (CAD).MethodsThis case-control study
   was conducted in an educational hospital in Ilam, Iran from June 2014 to
   September 2015. Totally 300 participants including 150 patients with CAD
   (case group) and 150 healthy individuals (control group) were selected
   and their plasma leptin, adiponectin and leptin/adiponectin ratio was
   measured. The extent and severity of coronary artery disease were
   assayed based on the number of involved vessels and Gensini score (GS)
   and the relation between scores and L/A findings were compared between
   cases and controls.ResultsTotally, 300 participants including 150
   (42.7\% male), mean age 59.511.4years as cases and 150 (50.7\% male),
   mean age 59.8 +/- 10.7 as controls were analyzed. Plasma level of leptin
   and L/A ratio were higher in cases compared to controls, but level of
   adiponectin was significantly lower in CAD patients than the control
   group. More number of involved coronary vessels was significantly
   correlated to higher level of plasma leptin, L/A ratio and lower level
   of adiponectin among case group. Moreover, adiponectin was negatively
   and leptin or L/A ratio were positively correlated with number of
   involved vessels. 7.3\% of cases had only one involved vessel, 42.7\%
   had two involved vessels, and 50\% of total patients had involved
   vessels and the mean +/- SD of GS in the case group was 23.6 +/-
   6.9.Conclusions Plasma levels of leptin, and adiponectin can indicate
   the extent of coronary artery diseases but leptin may be a better marker
   of extent of CAD than either L/A ratio or adiponectin separately.}},

Title = {{Negative effects of an allelopathic invader on AM fungal plant species
   drive community-level responses}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{102}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The mechanisms causing invasive species impact are rarely empirically
   tested, limiting our ability to understand and predict subsequent
   changes in invaded plant communities. Invader disruption of native
   mutualistic interactions is a mechanism expected to have negative
   effects on native plant species. Specifically, disruption of native
   plant-fungal mutualisms may provide non-mycorrhizal plant invaders an
   advantage over mycorrhizal native plants. Invasive Alliaria petiolata
   (garlic mustard) produces secondary chemicals toxic to soil
   microorganisms including mycorrhizal fungi, and is known to induce
   physiological stress and reduce population growth rates of native forest
   understory plant species. Here, we report on a 11-yr manipulative field
   experiment in replicated forest plots testing if the effects of removal
   of garlic mustard on the plant community support the mutualism
   disruption hypothesis within the entire understory herbaceous community.
   We compare community responses for two functional groups: the
   mycorrhizal vs. the non-mycorrhizal plant communities. Our results show
   that garlic mustard weeding alters the community composition, decreases
   community evenness, and increases the abundance of understory herbs that
   associate with mycorrhizal fungi. Conversely, garlic mustard has no
   significant effects on the non-mycorrhizal plant community. Consistent
   with the mutualism disruption hypothesis, our results demonstrate that
   allelochemical producing invaders modify the plant community by
   disproportionately impacting mycorrhizal plant species. We also
   demonstrate the importance of incorporating causal mechanisms of
   biological invasion to elucidate patterns and predict community-level
   responses.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Transition-metal dichalcogenide heterostructures exhibit moire patterns
   that spatially modulate the electronic structure across the material's
   plane. For certain material pairs, this modulation acts as a potential
   landscape with deep, trigonally symmetric wells capable of localizing
   interlayer excitons, forming periodic arrays of quantum emitters. Here,
   we study these moire localized exciton states and their optical
   properties. By numerically solving the two-body problem for an
   interacting electron-hole pair confined by a trigonal potential, we
   compute the localized exciton spectra for different pairs of materials.
   We derive optical selection rules for the different families of
   localized states, each belonging to one of the irreducible
   representations of the potential's symmetry group C-3v, and numerically
   estimate their polarization-resolved absorption spectra. We find that
   the optical response of localized moire interlayer excitons is dominated
   by states belonging to the doubly degenerate E irreducible
   representation. Our results provide insights into the optical properties
   of artificially confined excitons in two-dimensional semiconductors.}},

Title = {{Iranian general populations' and health care providers' preferences for

   cardiovascular disease}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{Background The use of statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular
   diseases is associated with different benefit and harm outcomes. The
   aime of this study is how important these outcomes are for people and
   what people's preferences are. Methods We conducted a
   preference-eliciting survey incorporating a best-worst scaling (BWS)
   instrument in Iran from June to November 2019. The relative importance
   of 13 statins-related outcomes was assessed on a sample of 1085
   participants, including 913 general population (486 women) and 172
   healthcare providers from the population covered by urban and rural
   primary health care centers. The participants made trade-off decisions
   and selected the most and least worrisome outcomes concurrently from 13
   choice sets; each contains four outcomes generated using the balanced
   incomplete block design. Results According to the mean (SD) BWS scores,
   which can be (+ 4) in maximum and (- 4) in minimum, in the general
   population, the most worrisome outcomes were severe stroke (3.37 (0.8)),
   severe myocardial infarction (2.71(0.7)), and cancer (2.69 (1.33)).
   While myopathy (- 3. 03 (1.03)), nausea/headache (- 2.69 (0.94)), and
   treatment discontinuation due to side effects (- 2.24 (1.14)) were the
   least worrisome outcomes. Preferences were similar between rural and
   urban areas and among health care providers and the general population
   with overlapping uncertainty intervals. Conclusion The rank of health
   outcomes may be similar in various socio-cultural contexts. The
   preferences for benefits and harms of statin therapy are essential to
   assess benefit-harm balance when recommending statins for primary
   prevention of cardiovascular diseases.}},

Title = {{Prevalence and social determinants of psychological distress among
   people who use drugs in Cambodia}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Background People who use drugs are at a disproportionately higher risk
   of mental disorders due to prolonged exposure to psychosocial
   challenges. However, studies on mental health among people who use drugs
   in resource-constrained countries are scarce. This study sheds light on
   the prevalence and correlates of psychological distress among people who
   use drugs in Cambodia. Methods We conducted this cross-sectional study
   in the capital city and 11 provinces in 2017. The Respondent Driven
   Sampling method was adapted to recruit 1677 people who used drugs for
   face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. Psychological
   distress was measured using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). A
   total score of GHQ-12 > 2 indicated high psychological distress. We
   performed a multiple logistic regression analysis to identify factors
   associated with psychological distress. Results We included 1598
   participants in the analyses, with a mean age of 28.6 years (SD = 7.8).
   Of the total, 42\% had high psychological distress - 50\% in women and
   37\% in men. The adjusted odds of having high psychological distress
   were significantly higher among participants who were 25-34 years old
   and 35 years and above, had been to a drug rehabilitation center, had
   been insulted by family members, and had been sexually harassed/abused
   by someone when they were growing up. The odds of having high
   psychological distress were significantly lower among participants who
   were male, lived in their own dwelling, reported injecting as the mode
   of the first drug use, and had someone taking care of them when they got
   sick. Conclusions This study documents a high prevalence of
   psychological distress among people who use drugs in Cambodia.
   Intervention programs that attempt to address mental health problems
   among people who use drugs in resource-limited settings should be
   gender- and age-sensitive and target more marginalized subpopulations.
   Mental health services can be integrated into HIV and harm-reduction
   programs for people who use drugs.}},

   hospital, we developed the ancillary central catheter emergency support
   service (ACCESS), a team for dedicated central access staffed by
   surgical residents to assist in the care of critical COVID-19 patients.
   We conducted a retrospective review of all patients for whom the team
   was activated. Furthermore, we distributed a survey to the critical care
   department to assess their perceived time saved per patient. Results.
   The ACCESS team placed 104 invasive catheters over 10 days with a low
   complication rate of .96\%. All critical care providers surveyed found
   the service useful and felt it saved at least 30 minutes of procedural
   time per patient, as patient to critical care provider ratios were
   increased from 12 patients to one provider to 44 patients to one
   provider. Conclusions. The ACCESS team has helped to effectively
   redistribute surgical staff, provide a learning experience for
   residents, and improve efficiency for the critical care team during this
   pandemic.}},

Abstract = {{Using density functional theory (DFT) combined with nonequilibrium
   Green's function method (NEGF), the electronic properties of undoped,
   B/P, B/As, and B/Sb co-doping (8, 0) single-walled carbon nanotubes
   (SWCNTs) are investigated in the presence of external bias. All of the
   doping process will reduce the band gap of doping carbon nanotubes
   (CNTs) until it becomes a conductor. We find that undoped and
   B/As-SWCNTs have analogous I-V curve. And the negative differential
   resistance (NDR) effect will occur due to the localized electron or
   spread effect of electron throughout the molecule at the range of 0-0.3
   V. When there is negative bias, negative differential resistance (NDR)
   effect occurs in the device of B/P-SWCNTs. But for the device of
   B/P-SWCNTs, the current increases slower from 0 to 0.3 V than that at
   the same positive bias. The electronic transport properties are strongly
   dependent on the presence of external bias. The results of our research
   will provide theoretical guidance for the application of carbon
   nanotubes in molecular devices (MDs).}},

Volume = {{15}},

Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Many patients in HIV care in Africa considered lost to follow up (LTFU)
   at one facility are reportedly accessing care in another. The success of
   these unofficial transfers as measured by time to re-entry at the
   new-facility, prevalence of treatment interruptions, speed of
   ART-initiation, and overall continuity of care is not well characterized
   but may reveal opportunities for improvement. We traced a random sample
   of LTFU HIV-infected patients in Zambia. Among those found alive and
   reported in care at a new-facility, we reviewed records at the receiving
   facility to verify transfer; and when verified, documented the transfer
   experience. We used Kaplan-Meier methods to examine incidence of
   ART-initiation after transfer to new clinic. We assessed demographic and
   clinical characteristics, official and cross-provincial transfer for
   associations with HIV treatment re-engagement using Poisson regression
   models and associations between official-transfer and same-day ART
   initiation at the new-facility. Among 350 LTFU-patients, 178 (51\%) were
   successfully verified through chart review at the new-facility. 132
   (74.2\%) were female, 72 (40.4\%) aged 25-35, and 51\% were ever
   recorded as previously being on ART. 110 patients (61.8\%) were
   registered under new ART-IDs and 97 (54.5\%) received a new HIV test.
   54\% of those previously on ART-initiated on the same-day. Using the
   same ART-ID was associated with same-day initiation compared to those
   receiving a new ART-ID (p = 0.07). 80\% (n = 91) of those ever on ART
   had evidence of medication initiation at new clinic. Among these,
   initiation reached 66\% (95\% CI: 56-75) by 30 days, 77.5\% (95\% CI:
   68-86) by 90 days after new-facility presentation. Many patients use new
   identifiers at new facilities, indicative of inefficiencies. Re-entry
   into new facilities among the unofficial-transfer population is often
   delayed and timely treatment initiation is inconsistent, suggesting
   interruptions in treatment. Health systems innovations to ensure smooth
   and safe transfers are needed to maintain quality HIV care.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents the preliminary result of the multidisciplinary
   cruise EXPLOSEA2 surveying the northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Azores
   Archipelago from 46 degrees 30' N to 38 degrees 30' N aboard the R/V
   Sarmiento de Gamboa and ROV Luso over 54 days (June 11 to July 27,
   2019). In this cruise report, we detail the geophysical, hydrographic,
   geological, oceanographic, ecological, and microbiological data acquired
   and a brief of main findings. The cruise addressed the exploration and
   comprehensive characterization of venting sites, including the water
   column, the sediments and rocks that host the hydrothermal activity, and
   the associated mineralizations, biology, and microbiology. Deep
   hydrothermal chimneys and massive sulfide deposits (up 3,000 m in depth)
   within the Moytirra hydrothermal active field were identified on slopes
   that had not been explored previously. Another striking finding made
   during the EXPLOSEA2 cruise was the field of carbonate chimneys named
   the ``Magallanes-Elcano{''} field, a potentially relict
   ultramafic-hosted hydrothermal site sourced by abiotic methane. This
   field is related to a serpentinite and gabbro rock outcropping on a
   dome-shaped massif named the ``Iberian Massif.{''} An outstanding
   finding of the EXPLOSEA2 survey was the identification of the first
   garden of soft corals growing after active submarine eruptions were
   reported in the Azores Archipelago composed by a high density of soft
   corals the suborder Alcyoniina at the summit and flanks of a recent
   volcanic cone at 160 m water depth developed during the 1957-1958
   eruption of Capelinhos. Several cold-water coral habitats formed by
   colonial scleractinians (e.g., Lophelia pertusa and Madrepora oculata),
   coral gardens composed of mixed assemblages of black corals (Leiopathes
   sp.), and octocorals and dense aggregations of the glass sponge
   Pheronema carpenteri that may be classified as vulnerable marine
   ecosystems (VMEs) have been discovered during the EXPLOSEA2 cruise along
   the northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge. This work reveals the importance of
   multidisciplinary surveys to the knowledge of deep-sea environments.}},

Title = {{How rankings disguise gender inequality: A comparative analysis of
   cross-country gender equality rankings based on adjusted wage gaps}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Methods for estimating the scope of unjustified inequality differ in
   their sensitivity to address institutional and structural deficiencies.
   In the case of gender wage gaps, adjusting adequately for individual
   characteristics requires prior assessment of several important
   deficiencies, primarily whether a given labor market is characterized by
   gendered selection into employment, gendered segmentation and whether
   these mechanisms differ along the distribution of wages. Given that
   countries are characterized by differentiated prevalence of these
   deficiencies, ranking countries on gender wage gaps is a challenging
   task. Whether a country is perceived as more equal than others depends
   on the interaction between the method of adjusting gender wage gap for
   individual characteristics and the prevalence of these deficiencies. We
   make the case that this interaction is empirically relevant by comparing
   the country rankings for the adjusted gender wage gap among 23 EU
   countries. In this relatively homogeneous group of countries, the
   interaction between method and underlying deficiencies leads to
   substantial variation in the extent of unjustified inequality. A country
   may change its place in the ranking by as much as ten positions-both
   towards greater equality and towards greater inequality. We also show
   that, if explored properly, this variability can yield valuable policy
   insights: changes in the ranking positions across methods inform on the
   policy priority of the labor market deficiencies across countries in
   relative terms.}},

Abstract = {{Assessing chemical loading from streams in remote, difficult-to-access
   watersheds is challenging. The Grand Canyon area in northern Arizona, an
   international tourist destination and sacred place for many Native
   Americans, is characterized by broad plateaus divided by canyons as much
   as two-thousand meters deep and hosts some of the highest-grade uranium
   deposits in the U.S. From 2015-2018 major surface waters in Grand Canyon
   were monitored for select elements associated with breccia-pipe uranium
   deposits in the area, including uranium, arsenic, cadmium, and lead.
   Dissolved constituents in the Colorado River were monitored upstream
   (Lees Ferry), in the middle (Phantom Ranch), and downstream (Diamond
   Creek) of uranium mining areas. Concentrations of uranium, arsenic,
   cadmium, and lead at these main-stem sites varied little during the
   study period and were all well below human health and aquatic life
   benchmark criteria (30, 10, 5, and 15 mu g/L maximum contaminant levels
   and 15, 150, 0.8, and 3.1 mu g/L aquatic life criteria, respectively).
   Additionally, dissolved and sediment-bound constituents were monitored
   during a wide range of streamflow conditions at Little Colorado River,
   Kanab Creek, and Havasu Creek tributaries, whose watersheds have
   experienced different levels of uranium mining activities over time.
   Samples from the tributary sites contained <= 3.8 mu g/L of dissolved
   cadmium and lead, and <= 17 mu g/L of dissolved uranium. Dissolved
   arsenic also was mostly below human and aquatic life criteria at Little
   Colorado River and Kanab Creek; however, 63\% of water samples from
   Havasu Creek were above the maximum contaminant level for arsenic.
   Arsenic in suspended sediment was greater than sediment quality
   guidelines in 9\%, 35\%, and 35\% of samples from Little Colorado River,
   Kanab Creek, and Havasu Creek, respectively. At the concentrations
   observed during this study, tributaries contributed on average only
   about 0.12 mu g/L of arsenic and 0.03 mu g/L of uranium to the main-stem
   river. This study demonstrates how chemical loading from mined
   watersheds may be reliably assessed across a wide range of flow
   conditions in challenging locations.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Despite significant improvement in computational and observational
   capabilities, predicting intensity and intensification of major tropical
   cyclones remains a challenge. In 2017 Hurricane Maria intensified to a
   Category 5 storm within 24 h, devastating Puerto Rico. In 2019 Hurricane
   Dorian, predicted to remain tropical storm, unexpectedly intensified
   into a Category 5 storm and destroyed the Bahamas. The official forecast
   and computer models were unable to predict rapid intensification of
   these storms. One possible reason for this is that key physics,
   including microscale processes at the air-sea interface, are poorly
   understood and parameterized in existing forecast models. Here we show
   that surfactants significantly affect the generation of sea spray, which
   provides some of the fuel for tropical cyclones and their
   intensification, but also provides some of the drag that limits
   intensity and intensification. Using a numerical model verified with a
   laboratory experiment, which predicts spray radii distribution starting
   from a 100 mu m radius, we show that surfactants increase spray
   generation by 20-34\%. We anticipate that bio-surfactants affect heat,
   energy, and momentum exchange through altered size distribution and
   concentration of sea spray, with consequences for tropical cyclone
   intensification or decline, particularly in areas of algal blooms and
   near coral reefs, as well as in areas affected by oil spills and
   dispersants.}},

Abstract = {{In many orchards, irrigation scheduling is designed based on data from
   meteorological networks and considering homogeneous soil properties.
   Such assumptions may result in inefficient irrigation, which is
   difficult to constrain without expensive or invasive techniques. Here we
   have evaluated the ability of the electrical resistivity tomography
   (ERT) for detecting meter-scale irrigation uniformity and deep
   percolation during irrigation. The spatiotemporal variability of soil
   volumetric water content (VWC) in a vineyard located near Santiago
   (Chile) was inferred using ERT monitoring of two irrigation cycles. The
   electrical resistivity structure up to 4 m depth was estimated using
   two-dimensional inversion of ERT data. ERT results were verified by
   comparing resistivity models with VWC measured with soil moisture
   sensors, soil properties mapped in a 2 m-depth soil pit, and the
   spatiotemporal evolution of VWC obtained by solving numerically Richards
   equation. Largest temporal variations of resistivity were observed
   within the root depth (1 m) and are consistent with expected relative
   changes in VWC during irrigation. ERT images exhibit lateral changes in
   resistivity at these depths, likely indicating non-uniform infiltration
   of water controlled by observed soil texture variations. Resistivity
   changes were also observed below the root zone, suggesting that a
   fraction of the irrigation water percolates downward. These findings can
   be explained by an excess of irrigation water applied during the
   monitoring, which was planned considering regional evapotranspiration
   (ET) data that overestimated the actual ET measured at the vineyard.
   Altogether, our results suggest that ERT monitoring during irrigation is
   a cost-effective tool to constrain the performance of irrigation
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Bone stock conservation, hip anatomy preservation, and
   greater stability are among the promoted advantages of hip resurfacing
   (HR). However, the disappointing failure of some implants nearly led to
   its abandonment. The aim of this study was to compare clinical scores
   and revision and complication rates after HR with those after total hip
   arthroplasty (THA). Methods: Two hundred and three hips were randomized
   to 28-mm metal-on-metal (MoM) THA (99 hips) or to HR (104 hips). Main
   outcome measures compared between groups were the Western Ontario and
   McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score, the revision
   rate, and the complication rates. The radiographic findings were also
   assessed. Results: After a mean follow-up of 15 years (range, 14 to 16
   years), 9 (4.4\%) of the 203 patients were lost to follow-up and 15
   (7.4\%) had died. The Kaplan-Meier survivorship, with revision for any
   reason as the end point, was 89.2\% (95\% confidence interval {[}CI],
   82.3\% to 96.1\%) for HR and 94.2\% (95\% CI, 89.3\% to 99.1\%) for THA
   (p = 0.292). The reasons for revision included infection (3 patients),
   recurrent dislocation (1 patient), and adverse reaction to metal debris
   (ARMD) (1 patient) in the THA group and ARMD (2 patients) and femoral
   head loosening (7 patients) in the HR group. With aseptic revision as
   the end point, the Kaplan-Meier survivorship was significantly higher in
   the THA group (97.4\% versus 89.2\%; p = 0.033). No dislocation occurred
   in the HR group compared with 4 in the THA group (p = 0.058). Both
   groups achieved a similar mean WOMAC score (10.7 in the HR group and 8.8
   in the THA group; p = 0.749), Forgotten Joint Score (87.1 and 85.3,
   respectively; p = 0.410), University of California Los Angeles (UCLA)
   activity score (6.3 and 6.4, respectively; p = 0.189), and overall joint
   perception (p = 0.251). Conclusions: The specific HR and MoM 28-mm THA
   implants used in this study showed good long-term survival and function.
   The overall rates of complications and revisions were similar in both
   groups but were of different types. As it provides better femoral bone
   preservation and biomechanical reconstruction, HR may continue to have a

Abstract = {{In this work, Ni-Co alloy nanoparticles (NPs) on La-doped SiO2 showed
   excellent selectivity toward ethanol for direct ethanol synthesis via CO
   hydrogenation. Over the catalyst with an optimal ratio of Ni/Co, the
   total alcohol selectivity reached 33.5\%, of which ethanol occupied 47.0
   wt \%. The results demonstrated that the interaction between Co and Ni
   improved the ability to activate H-2 and CO and adjusted the amount of
   the dissociatively and associatively adsorbed CO. Besides, the mutual
   dilution of nickel and cobalt in Ni-Co alloy NPs effectively reduced the
   isolated Co or Ni-clusters; thus, the formation of heavy hydrocarbons
   was suppressed. In the reaction process, Ni@Co-Co2C, a core-shell
   composite with a nickel core and Co-Co2C shell, was formed, which
   suppressed the loss of nickel species. Moreover, with the reaction going
   on, a small amount of poorly alloyed Co-clusters would be covered
   gradually by the formed coke, resulting in an increase in alcohol
   selectivity.}},

Abstract = {{Background Local Chinese local pig breeds have thinner muscle fiber and
   higher intramuscular-fat (IMF) content. But its regulation mechanism has
   not been discussed in-depth. Studies indicated that long non coding RNAs
   (lncRNAs) play important role in muscle and fat development. Results The
   lncRNAs expressional differences in the longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle
   were identified between Huainan pigs (local Chinese pigs, fat-type, HN)
   and Large White pigs (lean-type, LW) at 38, 58, and 78 days post
   conception (dpc). In total, 2131 novel lncRNAs were identified in 18
   samples, and 291, 305, and 683 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs)
   were found between these two breeds at three stages, respectively. The
   mRNAs that co-expressed with these DELs were used for GO and KEGG
   analysis, and the results showed that muscle development and energy
   metabolism were more active at 58 dpc in HN, but at 78 dpc in LW pigs.
   Muscle cell differentiation and myofibril assembly might associated with
   earlier myogenesis and primary-muscle-fiber assembly in HN, and cell
   proliferation, insulin, and the MAPK pathway might be contribute to
   longer proliferation and elevated energy metabolism in LW pigs at 78
   dpc. The PI3K/Akt and cAMP pathways were associated with higher IMF
   deposition in HN. Intramuscular fat deposition-associated long noncoding
   RNA 1 (IMFlnc1) was selected for functional verification, and results
   indicated that it regulated the expressional level of caveolin-1 (CAV-1)
   by acting as competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to sponge miR-199a-5p.
   Conclusions Our data contributed to understanding the role of lncRNAs in
   porcine-muscle development and IMF deposition, and provided valuable
   information for improving pig-meat quality.}},

Abstract = {{Thickness and performance are two critical issues to be considered
   simultaneously in designing transmission-type meta-devices. In this
   paper, a general design methodology is proposed to achieve a broadband
   and ultrathin Huygens metasurface (HMS) with high transmittance. By
   using the asymmetry of structures to excite the magnetic response, the
   Huygens meta-atom can be as thin as lambda/26.3. Physical and geometric
   analyses of the meta-atom show that its electric and magnetic responses
   can be independently controlled, which provides a method to enlarge the
   bandwidth of the HMS with high transmittance. We demonstrate that the
   proposed meta-atoms can cover full phase range of 360. and present high
   transmittance with the minimum amplitude of -2.75 dB at the working
   frequency of 10.2 GHz. A prototype of transmitarray composed of the
   proposed meta-atoms is designed, fabricated, and tested. Both numerical
   and experimental results validate the excellent performance of the
   transmitarray. The measured bandwidth in terms of 3 dB gain is 9.8\%,
   and the measured gain at 10.2 GHz is 28.4 dBi, resulting in 43.0\%
   aperture efficiency.}},

Title = {{Global orbit of a complicated nonlinear system with the global dynamic
   frequency method}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF LOW FREQUENCY NOISE VIBRATION AND ACTIVE CONTROL}},
Abstract = {{Global orbits connect the saddle points in an infinite period through
   the homoclinic and heteroclinic types of manifolds. Different from the
   periodic movement analysis, it requires special strategies to obtain
   expression of the orbit and detect the associated profound dynamic
   behaviors, such as chaos. In this paper, a global dynamic frequency
   method is applied to detect the homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcation
   of the complicated nonlinear systems. The so-called dynamic frequency
   refers to the newly introduced frequency that varies with time t, unlike
   the usual static variable. This new method obtains the critical
   bifurcation value as well as the analytic expression of the orbit by
   using a standard five-step hyperbolic function-balancing procedure,
   which represents the influence of the higher harmonic terms on the
   global orbit and leads to a significant reduction of calculation
   workload. Moreover, a new homoclinic manifold analysis maps the periodic
   excitation onto the target global manifold that transfers the chaos
   discussion of non-autonomous systems into the orbit computation of the
   general autonomous system. That strategy unifies the global bifurcation
   analysis into a standard orbit approximation procedure. The numerical
   simulation results are shown to compare with the predictions.}},

Abstract = {{Let X be a closed oriented connected topological manifold of dimension n
   >= 5. The structure group S-TOP (X) is the abelian group of equivalence
   classes of all pairs (f, M) such that M is a closed oriented manifold
   and f : WM -> X is an orientation-preserving homotopy equivalence. The
   main purpose of this article is to prove that a higher rho invariant map
   defines a group homomorphism from the topological structure group S-TOP
   (X) of X to the analytic structure group K-n (C-L,C-0{*}((X) over tilde
   (Gamma))of X. Here (X) over tilde is the universal cover of X, Gamma =
   pi X-1 is the fundamental group of X, and C-L,C-0{*}((X) over tilde
   (Gamma)is a certain C{*}-algebra. In fact, we introduce a higher rho
   invariant map on the homology manifold structure group of a closed
   oriented connected topological manifold, and prove its additivity. This
   higher rho invariant map restricts to the higher rho invariant map on
   the topological structure group. More generally, the same techniques
   developed in this paper can be applied to define a higher rho invariant
   map on the homology manifold structure group of a closed oriented
   connected homology manifold. As an application, we use the additivity of
   the higher rho invariant map to study nonrigidity of topological
   manifolds. More precisely, we give a lower bound for the free rank of
   the algebraically reduced structure group of X by the number of torsion
   elements in pi X-1. Here the algebraically reduced structure group of X
   is the quotient of S-TOP (X)modulo a certain action of self-homotopy
   equivalences of X. We also introduce a notion of homological higher rho
   invariant, which can be used to detect many elements in the structure
   group of a closed oriented topological manifold, even when the
   fundamental group of the manifold is torsion free. In particular, we
   apply this homological higher rho invariant to show that the structure
   group is not finitely generated for a class of manifolds. (C) 2020 Wiley

Abstract = {{Maintaining the optimum growth rate and estimating the concentration of
   microalgae are critical in improving microalgae production. An efficient
   concentration assessment of microalgae is essential for a timely and
   effective determination of the harvest period. This study proposes the
   luminance and viscosity methods to predict the concentration of
   microalgae. Image analysis was applied to measure the concentration of
   native microalgae: Desmodesmus sp., Scenedesmus sp., Dictyosphaerium
   sp., and Klebsormidium sp. The experiments were performed using
   different concentrations of the dry cell weight (DCW) of these
   microalgae species. A dual-camera device was used to capture the images
   of the DCW solution in a flask. For the confirmation of viscosity, a
   viscometer was used to determine the concentration of microalgae. A
   comparative analysis was performed between the data from the image
   analysis and viscosity method. The results from the viscosity method
   showed a higher accuracy with R-2 = 0.9784 and the luminance method with
   R-2 = 0.8266. Further investigations revealed that the brightness of the
   DCW image had a limitation at a specific concentration where the color
   was unrecognized. The current image processing method has the potential
   to be applied in an outdoor cultivation facility for real-time data
   acquisition. Both methods have advantages in terms of required time and
   experimental costs. The image analysis method provides an alternative
   way to efficiently monitor the cultivation and harvesting of microalgae.}},

Title = {{Nasal respiration is necessary for ketamine-dependent high frequency
   network oscillations and behavioral hyperactivity in rats}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Changes in oscillatory activity are widely reported after subanesthetic
   ketamine, however their mechanisms of generation are unclear. Here, we
   tested the hypothesis that nasal respiration underlies the emergence of
   high-frequency oscillations (130-180 Hz, HFO) and behavioral activation
   after ketamine in freely moving rats. We found ketamine 20 mg/kg
   provoked ``fast{''} theta sniffing in rodents which correlated with
   increased locomotor activity and HFO power in the OB. Bursts of
   ketamine-dependent HFO were coupled to ``fast{''} theta frequency
   sniffing. Theta coupling of HFO bursts were also found in the prefrontal
   cortex and ventral striatum which, although of smaller amplitude, were
   coherent with OB activity. Haloperidol 1 mg/ kg pretreatment prevented
   ketamine-dependent increases in fast sniffing and instead HFO coupling
   to slower basal respiration. Consistent with ketamine-dependent HFO
   being driven by nasal respiration, unilateral naris blockade led to an
   ipsilateral reduction in ketamine-dependent HFO power compared to the
   control side. Bilateral nares blockade reduced ketamine-induced
   hyperactivity and HFO power and frequency. These findings suggest that
   nasal airflow entrains ketamine-dependent HFO in diverse brain regions,
   and that the OB plays an important role in the broadcast of this rhythm.}},

Abstract = {{We present a subspace method that accelerates data acquisition using
   Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry
   imaging (MSI). For MSI of biological tissue samples, there is a finite
   number of heterogeneous tissue types with distinct chemical profiles
   that introduce redundancy in the high-dimensional measurements. Our
   subspace model exploits the redundancy in data measured from whole-slice
   tissue samples by decomposing the transient signals into linear
   combinations of a set of basis transients with the desired spectral
   resolution. This decomposition allowed us to design a strategy that
   acquires a subset of long transients for basis determination and short
   transients for the remaining pixels, drastically reducing the
   acquisition time. The computational reconstruction strategy can maintain
   high-mass-resolution and spatial-resolution MSI while providing a
   10-fold improvement in throughput. We validated the capability of the
   subspace model using a rat sagittal brain slice imaging data set.
   Comprehensive evaluation of the quality of the mass spectral and ion
   images demonstrated that the reconstructed data produced by the reported
   method required only 15\% of the typical acquisition time and exhibited
   both qualitative and quantitative consistency when compared to the
   original data. Our method enables either higher sample throughput or
   higher-resolution images at similar acquisition lengths, providing
   greater flexibility in obtaining FT-ICR MSI measurements.}},

Title = {{Transcriptomic Analyses and Potential Therapeutic Targets of Pancreatic
   Cancer With Concomitant Diabetes}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) known as
   non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, which is increasingly
   acknowledged as being associated with an increased risk for a series of
   cancers. Pancreatic cancer is currently the fourth most common cause of
   cancer-related mortality, which has been proved to be worsened by
   internal diabetic condition. However, the underlying molecular
   mechanisms are less addressed. Furthermore, current knowledge revealed
   that therapeutic strategy by anti-diabetes for pancreatic cancer under
   diabetes condition have no satisfactory efficacy, and nor by
   chemotherapy in our study.
   Methods: To clarify these mysteries and widen our knowledge, both
   obesity-associated and non-obese-associated T2DM mouse models were
   generated by chemical induction with streptozotocin (STZ) and leptin
   receptor knockout (db/db) in mice. Then, the process of tumor
   progression was researched, and the gene expression profiling of
   pancreatic cancer in mice was performed using RNA-seq.
   Results: Our results showed that pancreatic cancer malignancy was
   increased with notable proliferation and metastatic potential in two
   diabetic mice model. Totally, 136 and 64 significantly differentially
   expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in STZ and db/db mice by
   transcriptomic analysis. The results also suggested that different
   carcinogenesis-related genes and potential molecular mechanisms
   contribute to the malignancy of pancreatic cancer in obesity-associated
   and non-obesity-associated T2DM. In obesity-associated db/db mice, the
   GO subcategories associated with most of the genes with downregulated
   expression are involved in the immune response. However, in
   non-obesity-associated STZ mice, in addition to the immune response
   category, the enriched subcategories also included angiogenesis and the
   extracellular matrix. While, two genes respectively encoding MMP-2 and
   MMP-9 were simultaneously abnormal up-regulated in pancreatic cancer
   tissue from diabetic mice of both STZ and db/db, that could act as
   potential therapeutic targets for significantly suppressing the
   malignant progression. Furthermore, an optimizing therapeutic strategy
   was further proposed that combining MMP-2/9 inhibitor with gemcitabine
   significantly enhanced anti-tumor effects on pancreatic cancer under
   diabetic condition, providing a theoretical basis for clinical
   applications.
   Conclusions: Generally, this study provides a comprehensive insight into
   diabetes as a risk factor for pancreatic cancer and has the potential to
   guide the development of enhanced treatment strategies.}},

   Pillar in Rock Burst Mine}},
Journal = {{SHOCK AND VIBRATION}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{It is of great significance to study the reasonable position of mining
   roadway under strip coal pillar for increasing the stability of mining
   roadway, reducing the waste of resources, and realizing the safety
   production of working face. Based on the research background of the
   working face under the strip coal pillar in Jinqiao Coal Mine of Jining,
   Shandong Province, through theoretical analysis, similar material
   simulation experiment, and numerical simulation experiment, the stress
   distribution law, plastic failure range, and rationality of coal pillar
   setting in different width sections are systematically studied. Finally,
   the tailentry of working face is determined at the position of 5 m from
   the bottom of strip coal pillar to 1308 goaf. During the mining period
   of 1310 working face, the peak value of side abutment pressure is at the
   position of 3 similar to 4 m; beyond 25 m in front of the coal wall, the
   deformation of the surrounding rock on the tailentry surface is small.
   After entering the advanced support section, the deformation of the two
   sides is mainly longitudinal crack expansion and local shallow small
   flakes; however, the roof is complete and stable. Therefore, the
   selection of tailentry location and coal pillar width has played a good
   role. The research results of this study can provide some reference for
   similar mine with similar geological and production technical
   conditions.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2021}},

Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{9582-9597}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The effects of low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOAs) on the
   adsorption of quinclorac by sepiolite were investigated using laboratory
   batch technique. Experiments were conducted with two natural sepiolite
   samples with different crystal structures and chemical compositions and
   high-purity sepiolite. The LMWOAs used were acetic, oxalic, and citric
   acid. And the adsorption mechanism was characterized using X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Our analysis revealed that
   adsorption of quinclorac on alpha-sepiolite and beta-sepiolite was
   inhibited in the presence of 4 mmol L-1 LMWOAs, whereas LMWOAs
   stimulated the adsorption of quinclorac in the high-purity sepiolite.
   Inhibition or stimulation varied across the different types of organic
   acids. The adsorption isotherms in the presence of 4 mmol L-1 LMWOAs
   were better explained by Freundlich and linear model. The effect of
   organic acid concentrations (0-32 mmol L-1) on the adsorption of
   quinclorac by the three sepiolite samples varies greatly depending on
   the type of organic acid and the property of sepiolite. FTIR, XRD, and
   XPS analyses showed that LMWOAs bound strongly to the Si-O bond
   structure, and Si-O-quinclorac-acetic acid (oxalic acid or citric acid)
   was formed on the surface of beta-sepiolite. The adsorption of
   quinclorac by beta-sepiolite was via hydrogen bond, complexation
   reactions, and charge transfer in the presence of LMWOAs. These results
   indicate that LMWOAs affect quinclorac adsorption through various
   interactions involving competition, electrostatic attraction, bridging
   action, and hydrogen bonding.}},

Abstract = {{The present study examined the components of oral reading fluency (ORF)
   via various indices and their relationships with comprehension and
   learner-perceived difficulty of oral reading among Chinese second
   language (L2) learners. One hundred participants read aloud paragraphs,
   completed the comprehension test, and rated the difficulty of the oral
   reading task. Nine indices were generated to measure ORF: the percentage
   of omissions, substitutions, repetitions, insertions, self-corrections,
   and segmental problems out of the total produced characters, the number
   of pauses per minute, the number of actually produced characters per
   minute, and the number of correctly read characters per minute. The
   results showed that the nine indices tapped the accuracy, speed,
   chunking, and monitoring components of the ORF construct. The accuracy,
   speed, and chunking dimensions effectively predicted comprehension and
   the accuracy and speed dimension was closely related to
   learner-perceived difficulty. These findings suggested that ORF is a
   multi-faceted construct and can be used to assess comprehension and
   detect learner difficulty in Chinese L2 reading.}},

   Promoting AmpC beta-Lactamase in Enterobacter cloacae}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Enterobacter cloacae complex (ECC), one of the most common opportunistic
   pathogens causing multiple infections in human, is resistant to
   beta-lactam antibiotics mainly due to its highly expressed chromosomal
   AmpC beta-lactamase. It seems that regulation of chromosomal AmpC
   beta-lactamase is associated with peptidoglycan recycling. However,
   underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. In this study, we
   confirmed that NagZ, a glycoside hydrolase participating in
   peptidoglycan recycling in Gram-negative bacteria, plays a crucial role
   in developing resistance of E. cloacae (EC) to beta-lactam antibiotics
   by promoting expression of chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamase. Our data
   shows that NagZ was significantly up-regulated in resistant EC
   (resistant to at least one type of the third or fourth generation
   cephalosporins) compared to susceptible EC (susceptible to all types of
   the third and fourth generation cephalosporins). Similarly, the
   expression and beta-lactamase activity of ampC were markedly enhanced in
   resistant EC. Moreover, ectopic expression of nagZ enhanced ampC
   expression and resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in susceptible EC.
   To further understand functions of NagZ in beta-lactam resistance,
   nagZ-knockout EC model (Delta nagZ EC) was constructed by homologous
   recombination. Conversely, ampC mRNA and protein levels were
   down-regulated, and resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics was attenuated
   in Delta nagZ EC, while specific complementation of nagZ was able to
   rescue ampC expression and resistance in Delta nagZ EC. More
   interestingly, NagZ and its hydrolyzates 1,6-anhydromuropeptides
   (anhMurNAc) could induce the expression of other target genes of AmpR (a
   global transcriptional factor), which suggested that the promotion of
   AmpC by NagZ is mediated AmpR activated by anhMurNAc in EC. In
   conclusion, these findings provide new elements for a better
   understanding of resistance in EC, which is crucial for the
   identification of novel potential drug targets.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel multi-exposure image fusion method based on
   generative adversarial networks (termed as GANFuse) is presented.
   Conventional multi-exposure image fusion methods improve their fusion
   performance by designing sophisticated activity-level measurement and
   fusion rules. However, these methods have a limited success in complex
   fusion tasks. Inspired by the recent FusionGAN which firstly utilizes
   generative adversarial networks (GAN) to fuse infrared and visible
   images and achieves promising performance, we improve its architecture
   and customize it in the task of extreme exposure image fusion. To be
   specific, in order to keep content of extreme exposure image pairs in
   the fused image, we increase the number of discriminators
   differentiating between fused image and extreme exposure image pairs.
   While, a generator network is trained to generate fused images. Through
   the adversarial relationship between generator and discriminators, the
   fused image will contain more information from extreme exposure image
   pairs. Thus, this relationship can realize better performance of fusion.
   In addition, the method we proposed is an end-to-end and unsupervised
   learning model, which can avoid designing hand-crafted features and does
   not require a number of ground truth images for training. We conduct
   qualitative and quantitative experiments on a public dataset, and the
   experimental result shows that the proposed model demonstrates better
   fusion ability than existing multi-exposure image fusion methods in both
   visual effect and evaluation metrics.}},

Abstract = {{Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), as a representative of fuel
   cell technology, has attracted much attention for its huge advantages in
   transportation application. Water management has a significant impact on
   the lifetime and performance of PEMFC. This study numerically
   investigates the movement of a water droplet in a single serpentine flow
   channel of PEMFC with different U-turn designs. The transport
   characteristics of the water droplet are obtained under both low and
   high airflow speeds, respectively. It is found that the droplet can pass
   through the U-turn for large fillet radius, while it is stuck in the
   corners of the U-turn for small fillet radius. The water droplet is
   transported as a whole without breakup under low airflow speed, but it
   is split into small droplets under high airflow speed at the U-turn.
   Hydrophobic channel surface promotes water removal at the U-turn of the
   channel, but its effect is weakened under high airflow speed. (C) 2019

Abstract = {{The Saccharomyces cerevisiae HO gene is a model regulatory system with
   complex transcriptional regulation. Budding yeast divide asymmetrically
   and HO is expressed only in mother cells where a nucleosome eviction
   cascade along the promoter during the cell cycle enables activation. HO
   expression in daughter cells is inhibited by high concentration of Ash1
   in daughters. To understand how Ash1 represses transcription, we used a
   myo4 mutation which boosts Ash1 accumulation in both mothers and
   daughters and show that Ash1 inhibits promoter recruitment of SWI/SNF
   and Gcn5. We show Ash1 is also required for the efficient nucleosome
   repopulation that occurs after eviction, and the strongest effects of
   Ash1 are seen when Ash1 has been degraded and at promoter locations
   distant from where Ash1 bound. Additionally, we defined a specific
   nucleosome/nucleosome-depleted region structure that restricts HO
   activation to one of two paralogous DNA-binding factors. We also show
   that nucleosome eviction occurs bidirectionally over a large distance.
   Significantly, eviction of the more distant nucleosomes is dependent
   upon the FACT histone chaperone, and FACT is recruited to these regions
   when eviction is beginning. These last observations, along with ChIP
   experiments involving the SBF factor, suggest a long-distance loop
   transiently forms at the HO promoter.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional self-powered ultraviolet photodetectors, which are usually
   designed based on p-n junction interfacial effects, exhibit low
   responsivity and specific detectivity because the photogenerated
   electrons and holes cannot be separated effectively. Unlike wide
   band-gap semiconductor materials, ferroelectrics have large remnant
   polarization and thus high depolarization electric field throughout the
   whole bulk region, which can cause effective separation of
   photogenerated electrons and holes. Based on this, in this study, we
   prepare Pb0.93La0.07(Zr1-xTix)(0.9825)O-3 (PLZT) ferroelectric thin
   films with large remnant polarization and self-powered ultraviolet
   photodetectors with Au/PLZT/FTO structure. The results indicate that the
   photoelectric response performances of the detectors improve as the
   remnant polarization of the PLZT thin film and positive poling voltage
   increase. By adjusting the Ti content, due to large remnant polarization
   of 47.4 mu C/cm(2) in the PLZT thin films with 80 mol\% Ti, the
   corresponding photodetector exhibits the best self-powered ultraviolet
   photoelectric response with the high photo/dark current ratio of 2600,
   responsivity of 2.05 mA/W, specific detectivity of 5.45 x 10(10) Jones,
   and fast response speed (rise time of 18 ms). These values are superior
   to those of recently reported self-powered ultraviolet photodetectors.}},

Abstract = {{The cooling system is a critical element in tooling for hot stamping
   high-strength aluminium alloys, for which very high quenching rates are
   required to ensure a supersaturated solid solution state in formed
   parts. To enhance cooling, ducts within the tools should be close and
   conformal to the surface die profile. Currently, ducts with curved
   profiles are made by drilling short straight lengths in die segments
   which are clamped together to form a complete die, which is expensive
   and hard to achieve the shape of duct with best cooling performance. To
   address these disadvantages, a novel method which enables efficient
   manufacture of conformal cooling systems by embedding a network of
   tubular cooling ducts within a cast matrix is presented in this paper.
   The feasibility of the proposed method of making ducts in the hot
   stamping die is demonstrated. Both experimental and computer-based die
   quenching tests using heated aluminium test pieces were undertaken to
   determine the cooling performance of a laboratory-scale tool set with
   cooling ducts. Simulations using the validated FE model were performed
   to investigate the effects of cross-sectional geometry, material and
   duct layout, on the quenching performance of the tools. It was found
   that ducts made of mild steel perform sufficiently well to make the use
   of high conductivity copper unnecessary. For a flat die surface, square
   section ducts provided highest cooling rates in comparison with circular
   and diagonal ones. The uniformity of die temperature increases with the
   decreased distance between neighbouring ducts, which indicates that a
   minimal gap is recommended without deteriorating tool strength. The
   developed tooling technology has the potential to provide a low-cost,
   highly efficient method of making conformal cooling ducts because the
   hot stamping die of high-strength aluminium alloy panels requires larger
   dimension, greater complexity and higher quenching rates.}},

Abstract = {{Cell penetration by high aspect-ratio vertical nanostructures such as
   nanowires and nanopillars provides a powerful method for accessing the
   cell interior for delivery and sensing. However, there is a lack of
   studies on the understanding of the mechanism of cell membrane
   penetration and how design nanostructures to optimize the efficiency of
   penetration remains unclear. Here, we propose an analytical model to
   elucidate the mechanism of cells penetration by analyzing the
   free-energy change of cells adhered to the nanostructures surface.
   Furthermore, we provide a simple method to evaluate the crossover radius
   or density for cell membrane penetration. By introducing a dimensionless
   parameter, i.e., adhesion area factor, we investigated the effects of
   the radius and distribution densities of nanostructures on cell membrane
   penetration which is determined by the competition between adhesion
   energy and deformation energy. Besides, a diagram of the distribution of
   cell penetration and no penetration is obtained. From the cell
   penetration diagram, one can determine easily and intuitively the
   relations of cell penetration state with the radius and distribution
   densities of nanostructures. Our theoretical results seem to show broad
   agreement with experimental observations, which implies that these
   studies would provide useful guidance to the design of nanopatterned
   surfaces for biomedical applications.}},

Abstract = {{The billions of tons of mineral dust released into the atmosphere each
   year provide an important surface for reaction with gas-phase
   pollutants. These reactions, which are often enhanced in the presence of
   light, can change both the gas-phase composition of the atmosphere and
   the composition and properties of the dust itself. Because dust contains
   titanium-rich grains, studies of dust photochemistry have largely
   employed commercial titanium dioxide as a proxy for its photochemically
   active fraction; to date, however, the validity of this model system has
   not been empirically determined. Here, for the first time, we directly
   investigate the photochemistry of the complement of natural
   titanium-containing minerals most relevant to mineral dust, including
   anatase, rutile, ilmenite, titanite, and several titanium-bearing
   species. Using ozone as a model gas-phase pollutant, we show that
   titanium-containing minerals other than titanium dioxide can also
   photocatalyze trace gas uptake, that samples of the same mineral phase
   can display very different reactivity, and that prediction of dust
   photoreactivity based on elemental/mineralogical analysis and/or
   light-absorbing properties is challenging. Together, these results show
   that the photochemistry of atmospheric dust is both richer and more
   complex than previously considered, and imply that a full understanding
   of the scope and impact of dust-mediated processes will require the
   community to engage with this complexity via the study of ambient
   mineral dust samples from diverse source regions.}},

Abstract = {{Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is the most commercialized entomopathogenic
   species. However, the low efficacy against notorious sap-sucking
   Hemipteran pests and the high costs of production, reduce the
   applicability of Bt biopesticides. In this context, B. thuringiensis
   AH-2 (Bt-2) isolated from soil was found to release parasporal
   inclusions and aphicidal activity. Bt-2 showed optimal growth at pH 8
   and 30 degrees C in tryptic soy broth (TSB) and maintained normal growth
   when cultured in cost-effective test media, pink brown (PB),
   supplemented with either glucose (PBG) or sucrose (PBS). To study
   aphicidal activity against cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii), Bt-2 and a
   commercial B. thuringiensis subspecies kurstaki (Btk) were used. Using
   third nymph (3 N) instars, treatment with Bt-2 caused 70.2, 78.1 and
   88.4\% mortality at 10, 25 and 50\% culture concentrations,
   respectively. Similarly, Btk resulted in 79.9, 80.4 and 92.9\% mortality
   at 10, 25 and 50\%, respectively. When cultured in TSB, PBG and PBS
   media, Bt-2 culture (50\%) resulted in 85.9, 82.9 and 82.2\% 3 N
   mortality, respectively. Equally, Btk caused a mortality of 79.9, 78.9
   and 78.9\% in TSB, PBG and PBS, respectively. Bt-2 exerted a notably
   higher aphicidal efficacy at 24 h after treatment compared to Btk,
   especially at low concentration. Moreover, both Bt strains significantly
   suppressed adult fecundity compared to control. At 50\% culture
   concentration, Bt-2 and Btk suppressed adult fecundity by 98.3 and
   91.1\%, respectively. Our result demonstrates a strong aphicidal
   efficacy of Bt-2, and its potential production using cost-effective PB
   medium.}},

Title = {{Differential effects of antibiotics on neutrophils exposed to
   lipoteichoic acid derived from Staphylococcus aureus}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY AND ANTIMICROBIALS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{Background Persistent bacteremia occurs in at least 30\% of patients
   with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection (SAB) and may be
   attributable to a dysregulated host immune response. Neutrophils
   interact with a variety of S. aureus microbial factors, including
   lipoteichoic acid (LTA), to activate phagocytic function in a
   concentration-dependent manner. Antibiotics have been shown to exert
   both direct antimicrobial action as well as immunomodulatory effects. In
   this study, we compared the effects of different anti-staphylococcal
   antibiotics on LTA-mediated immune activation of neutrophils. Methods
   Neutrophils obtained from healthy volunteers were exposed to two levels
   of LTA (1 and 10 mu g/ml) with or without addition of antibiotics from
   different pharmacologic classes (vancomycin, daptomycin, ceftaroline).
   Neutrophil function was assessed by examining phagocytic response,
   activation (CD11b, CD62L expression), Toll-like receptor-2 expression,
   cell survival and apoptosis, and CXCL8 release. Results Differential
   LTA-mediated antibiotic effects on neutrophil function were observed
   primarily at the high LTA exposure level. Ceftaroline in the presence of
   10 mu g/ml LTA had the most prominent effects on phagocytosis and CD11b
   and CD62L expression, with trends towards increased neutrophil survival
   and preservation of CXCL8 release when compared to daptomycin and
   vancomycin with the latter significantly dampening PMN CXCL8 release.
   Conclusions Select antimicrobial agents, such as ceftaroline, exert
   immunostimulatory effects on neutrophils exposed to S. aureus LTA, which
   when confirmed in vivo, could be leveraged for its dual immunomodulatory
   and antibacterial actions for the treatment of persistent SAB mediated
   by a dysregulated host response.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW X}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{We introduce a dynamical picture, referred to as correlation picture,
   which connects a correlated bipartite state to its uncorrelated
   counterpart. This picture allows us to derive an exact dynamical
   equation for a general open-system dynamics with system-environment
   correlations included. This exact dynamics is in the form of a
   Lindblad-like equation even in the presence of initial
   system-environment correlations. For explicit calculations, we also
   develop a weak-correlation expansion that allows us to introduce
   systematic perturbative approximations. This expansion provides
   approximate master equations that can feature advantages over existing
   weak-coupling techniques. As a special case, we derive a Markovian
   master equation, which is different from existing approaches. We compare
   our equations with corresponding standard weak-coupling equations using
   two examples, for which our correlation-picture formalism is more
   accurate, or at least as accurate as the weak-coupling equations.}},

Abstract = {{Background Glioblastomas (GBMs) in patients harboring somatic or
   germinal mutations of mismatch-repair (MMR) genes exhibit a hypermutable
   phenotype. Here, we describe a GBM patient with increased tumor
   mutational burden and germline MMR mutations, treated using anti-PD1
   therapy. Methods A woman with newly diagnosed GBM (nGBM) was treated by
   surgery, radiotherapy, and temozolomide. The tumor recurred after 13
   months leading to a second surgery and treatment with nivolumab.
   Whole-exome sequencing was performed on the nGBM, recurrent GBM (rGBM),
   and blood. Immune infiltration was investigated by immunohistochemistry
   and the immune response in the blood during treatment was analyzed by
   flow cytometry. Results High density of infiltrating CD163 + cells was
   found in both GBM specimens. Large numbers of CD3 + and CD8 + T cells
   were homogeneously distributed in the nGBM. The infiltration of CD4 + T
   cells and a different CD8 + T cell density were observed in the rGBM.
   Both GBM shared 12,431 somatic mutations, with 113 substitutions
   specific to the nGBM and 1,683 specific to the rGBM. Germline variants
   included pathogenic mutation in the MSH2 (R359S) gene, suggesting the
   diagnosis of Lynch syndrome. Systemic immunophenotyping revealed the
   generation of CD8 + T memory cells and persistent activation of CD4 + T
   cells. The patient is still receiving nivolumab 68 months after the
   second surgery. Conclusions Our observations indicate that the
   hypermutator phenotype associated with germinal mutations of MMR genes
   and abundant T-cell infiltration contributes to a durable clinical
   benefit sustained by a persistent and robust immune response during
   anti-PD1 therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Prior studies have examined the link between female representation in
   the boards of directors (BoD) and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).
   However, these studies have underestimated the multidimensional nature
   of CSR, whereby CSR comprises different dimensions, and organizations
   engage in CSR activities in various degrees, thus leading to potentially
   contrasting performance respect to such different dimensions. Therefore,
   this study aims at (a) elucidating the varying mechanisms underlying the
   effects of the presence of women on BoD and several dimensions of CSR
   performance and (b) testing these effects considering multiple CSR
   performance measures (i.e., environmental performance, employees'
   well-being, customers' management, community engagement, and ethical
   governance). To do so, we propose a set of hypotheses based on upper
   echelon and social role theories that are tested on a sample of European
   and US certified Benefit Corporations (B Corps). Results reveal that
   female representation in the BoD is not beneficial for each specific CSR
   dimension, albeit it is beneficial at an aggregate level. Specifically,
   it is positively associated with customers' management and community
   engagement, negatively related to environmental performance and
   employees' well-being, and not significantly associated with ethical
   governance.}},

Title = {{Does the type of health insurance enrollment affect provider choice,

Journal = {{BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{Background Two of the objectives of Universal Health Coverage are equity
   in access to health services and protection from financial risks. This
   paper seeks to examine whether the type of health insurance enrollment
   affects the utilization of health services, choice of provider and
   financial protection of households in Togo. Methods Data were obtained
   from a cross-sectional, representative household survey involving 1180
   insured households that had reported either illness in the household in
   the 4 weeks preceding the survey or hospitalization in the 12 months
   preceding the survey. A nested logit model was used to account for the
   utilization of health services and provider choice, and methods of
   assessing catastrophic health care expenditures were used to analyze the
   level of household financial protection. Results Policyholders of
   private health insurance use private health care facilities more than
   policyholders of public health insurance. The main reasons for not using
   health centers among households with public insurance were out-of-pocket
   payments (49.19\%), waiting time (36.80\%), and distance to the nearest
   health center (36.76\%). Furthermore, on average, households with public
   insurance spent a higher proportion of their total monthly nonfood
   expenditures on health care than those with private insurance. We find
   that the type of insurance, share of expenditures allocated to food,
   distance to the nearest health center, and waiting time significantly
   impact the choice of provider. Regardless of the type of health
   insurance, elderly individuals avoid using private health centers and
   referral hospitals due to the high cost. Conclusion We found that a
   multiple health insurance system results in a multilevel health system
   that is not equitable for everyone. The capacity of the health insurance
   system to provide equitable health care services and protect its members
   from catastrophic health care expenditures should be at the core of
   health care reform. This study recommends raising awareness of the
   criteria for the reimbursement of medical procedures within the
   framework of public insurance and promoting specific health insurance
   mechanisms for elderly individuals. Careful attention should be paid to
   ensuring universal education and literacy as a means of improving access
   to and the use of health care.}},

Title = {{Prediction of survival and recurrence in patients with pancreatic cancer
   by integrating multi-omics data}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{Predicting the prognosis of pancreatic cancer is important because of
   the very low survival rates of patients with this particular cancer.
   Although several studies have used microRNA and gene expression profiles
   and clinical data, as well as images of tissues and cells, to predict
   cancer survival and recurrence, the accuracies of these approaches in
   the prediction of high-risk pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) still need
   to be improved. Accordingly, in this study, we proposed two biological
   features based on multi-omics datasets to predict survival and
   recurrence among patients with PAAD. First, the clonal expansion of
   cancer cells with somatic mutations was used to predict prognosis. Using
   whole-exome sequencing data from 134 patients with PAAD from The Cancer
   Genome Atlas (TCGA), we found five candidate genes that were mutated in
   the early stages of tumorigenesis with high cellular prevalence (CP).
   CDKN2A, TP53, TTN, KCNJ18, and KRAS had the highest CP values among the
   patients with PAAD, and survival and recurrence rates were significantly
   different between the patients harboring mutations in these candidate
   genes and those harboring mutations in other genes (p = 2.39E-03, p =
   8.47E-04, respectively). Second, we generated an autoencoder to
   integrate the RNA sequencing, microRNA sequencing, and DNA methylation
   data from 134 patients with PAAD from TCGA. The autoencoder robustly
   reduced the dimensions of these multi-omics data, and the K-means
   clustering method was then used to cluster the patients into two
   subgroups. The subgroups of patients had significant differences in
   survival and recurrence (p = 1.41E-03, p = 4.43E-04, respectively).
   Finally, we developed a prediction model for prognosis using these two
   biological features and clinical data. When support vector machines,
   random forest, logistic regression, and L2 regularized logistic
   regression were used as prediction models, logistic regression analysis
   generally revealed the best performance for both disease-free survival
   (DFS) and overall survival (OS) (accuracy {[}ACC] = 0.762 and area under
   the curve {[}AUC] = 0.795 for DFS; ACC = 0.776 and AUC = 0.769 for OS).
   Thus, we could classify patients with a high probability of recurrence
   and at a high risk of poor outcomes. Our study provides insights into
   new personalized therapies on the basis of mutation status and
   multi-omics data.}},

Abstract = {{Recipients of Medical Aid, a government-funded social assistance program
   for the poor, have a shorter life expectancy than National Health
   Insurance beneficiaries in Korea. This study aims to explore the
   contributions of age and major causes of death to the life expectancy
   difference between the two groups. We used the National Health
   Information Database provided by the National Health Insurance Service
   individually linked to mortality registration data of Statistics Korea
   between 2008 and 2017. Annual abridged life tables were constructed and
   Arriaga's life expectancy decomposition method was employed to estimate
   age- and cause-specific contributions to the life expectancy gap between
   National Health Insurance beneficiaries and Medical Aid recipients. The
   life expectancy difference between National Health Insurance
   beneficiaries and Medical Aid recipients was 14.5 years during the
   period of 2008-2017. The age groups between 30 and 64 years accounted
   for 78.7\% and 67.5\% of the total life expectancy gap in men and women,
   respectively. Cancer was the leading cause of death contributing to
   excess mortality among Medical Aid recipients compared to National
   Health Insurance beneficiaries. More specifically, alcohol-attributable
   deaths (such as alcoholic liver disease, liver cancer, liver cirrhosis,
   and alcohol/substance abuse), suicide, and cardiometabolic risk
   factor-related deaths (such as cerebrovascular disease, ischemic heart
   disease, and diabetes) were the leading contributors to the life
   expectancy gap. To decrease excess deaths in Medical Aid recipients and
   reduce health inequalities, effective policies for tobacco and alcohol
   regulation, suicide prevention, and interventions to address
   cardiometabolic risk factors are needed.}},

Title = {{Stingy principals or benevolent stewards: Reward practices in family
   versus nonfamily trucking companies}},
Journal = {{HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT}},
Abstract = {{Research on family firms' employment practices remains equivocal with
   findings from studies framed on the basis of stewardship and
   socioemotional wealth (SEW) preservation perspectives suggesting that
   family firms are better employers than nonfamily peers, and findings
   from studies grounded on agency theory suggesting the opposite. Arguing
   that these two perspectives are not mutually exclusive, we theorize
   that, consistent with notions of compensating differentials, pay
   practices in family firms offer a compensatory balancing of lower base
   pay with pay forms and benefits signaling the kind of caring, support
   and long-term commitment typical of such firms. Accordingly, while,
   consistent with an agentic perspective, pay rates in nonfamily firms may
   be higher than in family firms, consistent with the stewardship/SEW
   perspective, we argue that pay and benefits may be structured to offer
   greater long-term reward security in family firms. Focusing on reward
   practices among employees in a single job in a single industry (i.e.,
   truck drivers), we find that where there are differences, they generally
   favor family firms, with a significantly higher proportion of family
   firms paying on the basis of fixed salary (as opposed to more variable
   hourly/mile-based rates), and with those firms paying hourly offering
   typical and ``floor{''} rates higher than those offered by nonfamily
   firms. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{Methyl-NMR enables atomic-resolution studies of structure and dynamics
   of large proteins in solution. However, resonance assignment remains
   challenging. The problem is to combine existing structural informational
   with sparse distance restraints and search for the most compatible
   assignment among the permutations. Prior classification of peaks as
   either from isoleucine, leucine, or valine reduces the search space by
   many orders of magnitude. However, this is hindered by overlapped
   leucine and valine frequencies. In contrast, the nearest-neighbor
   nuclei, coupled to the methyl carbons, resonate in distinct frequency
   bands. Here, we develop a framework to imprint additional information
   about passively coupled resonances onto the observed peaks. This depends
   on simultaneously orchestrating closely spaced bands of resonances along
   different magnetization trajectories, using principles from control
   theory. For methyl-NMR, the method is implemented as a modification to
   the standard fingerprint spectrum (the 2D-HMQC). The amino acid type is
   immediately apparent in the fingerprint spectrum. There is no additional
   relaxation loss or an increase in experimental time. The method is
   validated on biologically relevant proteins. The idea of generating new
   spectral information using passive, adjacent resonances is applicable to
   other contexts in NMR spectroscopy. The structure and dynamics of large
   proteins and complexes can be studied by methyl-NMR but resonance
   assignment is still challenging. Here, the authors present a NMR method
   that leverages optimal control pulse design to unambiguously distinguish
   between Leu and Val using a simple 2D HMQC experiment and they apply it
   to several proteins including Cas9, interleukin, and human translation
   initiation factor eIF4a.}},

Abstract = {{Onion basal rot is the most destructive disease caused by Fusarium
   oxysporum f. sp. cepae (FOC) for onion growing regions of the world. To
   control this disease, biological control agents 287 phosphate
   solubilising bacteria (PSB) were isolated from 43 onion rhizosphere soil
   samples. The value on the phosphate solubilisation index (SI) of the PSB
   was calculated to be in the range of 1.2-5.5, and a quantitative
   estimation of P solubilisation was investigated in liquid medium and
   found to be in the range of 15.2-382.5 mg/l. Furthermore, all tested
   organisms solubilised rock phosphates (RP) by lowering the medium's pH.
   These isolates were tested for their effect on the mycelial growth of
   FOC in dual cultures. Eight isolates were determined to inhibit mycelial
   growth of FOC at rates from 71.5 to 75.7\%. For the pot experiments, 15
   rhizobacteria (12 isolates highest P-solubilising and 3 isolates
   P-solubilising and effective antagonist) were selected through 287 PSB.
   In the pot experiments, onion seeds (sensitive and resistant) coated
   with PSB were sown in soil which was infected with FOC and RP. Seed
   treatment with the isolates was found to suppress disease severity in
   ratios varying from 10.9 to 77.8\%. At the same time, these PSB isolates
   significantly reduced disease, similar in degree to a chemical fungicide
   (Antrachol) (p 0.05). The results of the in vitro and in vivo research
   demonstrated that the isolated PSB are potential biological control
   agents and need to be further researched for the biochemical basis of
   their activity against FOC.}},

   terpolymer cryogels}},
Journal = {{POLYMER}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{208}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{pH-responsive terpolymer poly(hydroxyethyl
   methacrylate-2-acrylamido-2-methyl-propanosulfonic
   acid-diethylaminoethyl methacrylate) cryogels and hydmgels (named as
   CGs-PHA/Dm and HGs-PHA/Dm) were synthesized in ethanol-water mixture
   using different monomer feed compositions. By the combination of three
   monomers, an interesting system was designed with tunable pH/temperature
   responsiveness and elasticity. ATR-FTIR spectrums obtained after
   swelling swelling in pH buffer solution of 2.1 indicated -R2NH+
   stretching of DEAEMA moities in terpolymer matrices. By incorporation of
   DEAEMA units with ionizable amino groups, terpolymer CGs-PHA/Dm and
   HGs-PHA/Dm gels exhibited pH-responsive swelling behavior. Inclusion of
   DEAEMA dramatically altered pH-responsiveness of terpolymers in
   simulated intestinal fluid at pH 6.6. Dependence of interaction
   parameter chi on terpolymer volume fraction in gel nu(2) by a linear
   function and its enthalpic/entropic components with swelling pH were
   determined. At pH < 6.6, dependence of chi parameter on the swelling was
   evaluated as chi = 1.097 - 2.965 nu(2), while at basic pH region, pH >
   6.6, chi = 0.576 + 0.459 nu(2). Both pH of swelling medium and the
   amount of DEAEMA in terpolymer composition affected the compression
   moduli of terpolymer gels. Flory-Rehner theory extended to correlate the
   compressive modulus with swelling pH and the dependence of the effective
   crosslink density nu(e) on mol\% DEAEMA was expressed in both acidic and
   basic conditions. pH-triggered swelling/shrinking of terpolymer gels
   were studied as reversible cycles in buffer solutions of pH 2.1 and 9.8.
   DEAEMA-rich terpolymer gels showed overshooting phenomena due to dynamic
   conformational changes of diethylaminoethyl units. Terpolymer cryogels
   exhibited much faster swelling kinetics than that of terpolymer
   hydrogels in simulated gastric fluid at pH 2.1. The values of diffusion
   coefficient seemed to be strongly dependent of terpolymer composition.}},

Abstract = {{In ethnographic research and analysis, reflexivity is vital to achieving
   constant coordination between field and concept work. However, it has
   been conceptualized predominantly as an ethnographer's individual mental
   capacity. In this article, we draw on ten years of experience in
   conducting research together with partners from social psychiatry and
   mental health care across different research projects. We unfold three
   modes of achieving reflexivity co-laboratively: contrasting and
   discussing disciplinary concepts in interdisciplinary working groups and
   feedback workshops; joint data interpretation and writing; and
   participating in political agenda setting. Engaging these modes reveals
   reflexivity as a distributed process able to strengthen the
   ethnographer's interpretative authority, and also able to constantly
   push the conceptual boundaries of the participating disciplines and
   professions.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{For a long time, melanocytes were believed to be exclusively derived
   from neural crest cells migrating from the neural tube toward the
   developing skin. This notion was then challenged by studies suggesting
   that melanocytes could also be made from neural crest-derived Schwann
   cell precursors (SCPs) on peripheral nerves. A SCP origin was inferred
   from lineage tracing studies in mice using a Plp1 promoter-controlled
   Cre driver transgene (Plp1-CreERT2) and a fluorescent Rosa26
   locus-controlled Cre reporter allele (Rosa26(FloxSTOP-YFP)). However,
   doubts were raised in part because another SCP-directed Cre driver
   controlled by the Dhh promoter (Dhh-Cre) was apparently unable to label
   melanocytes when used with a non-fluorescent Rosa26 locus-controlled Cre
   reporter (Rosa26(FloxSTOP-LacZ)). Here, we report that the same Dhh-Cre
   driver line can efficiently label melanocytes when used in a pure FVB/N
   background together with the fluorescent instead of the non-fluorescent
   Rosa26 locus-controlled Cre reporter. Our data further suggest that the
   vast majority of skin melanocytes are SCP-derived. Interestingly, we
   also discovered that SCPs contribute inner ear melanocytes in a
   region-specific manner, extensively contributing to the cochlea but not
   to the vestibule.}},

Abstract = {{Crisis management is often conceived from the position of an omniscient
   narrator, albeit the general consensus that crises are subjectively
   interpreted and experienced. The paper makes an analytical attempt to
   de-homogenize the notion of crisis. We argue that the perception of
   crises differs and present a spatial perspective on crisis to foreground
   the positionality of different actor groups. By referring to the EHEC
   outbreak 2011 in Germany, we explore two spatial configurations that
   seem to be of particular relevance: territories embedded in a nested
   hierarchy and topologies of interconnected places. State authorities
   think and act strongly in terms of territorial borders and along
   sectoral boundaries. From their point of view, the crisis tends to be
   threatening due to its ``transboundary{''} character. Medical experts,
   in contrast, coped with the crisis in trans-local networks of
   colleagues. For this group, the crisis was also an opportunity to
   substantially enhance professional knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{The interface layer is responsible for the outward migration of oxygen
   atoms, which subsequently leads to an adjustment in the energetic
   performance of nanothermite films. In this study, sandwich-structured
   CuOgNi/Al and CuOgNiO/Al nanowire thermite films were successfully
   prepared to investigate the effects of the interface layer on the
   heat-release, ignition, and combustion performance. The effects of the
   Ni and NiO interface layers are extremely different on the heat-release
   performance and combustion properties of the CuO/Al nanowire thermite
   film. Herein, the introduced Ni layer decreased the heat release (1979.7
   J/g), reactivity (E-a = 177.3 kJ/mol), and maximum pressure (2.32 MPa)
   compared with the CuO/Al composite. Al/Ni alloys can be formed at the
   interface to prevent oxygen from diffusing between CuO and Al. Moreover,
   the incorporation of the Ni interface layer into the CuO/Al systems
   results in a heat drop due to its heat-absorption capability as well as
   its blockage of heat transfer from the thermite reaction. The deposition
   of the NiO layer between CuO and Al leads to an increase in the heat
   release (3014.2 J/g) and a decrease in the activation energy (E-a =
   178.6 kJ/mol). The NiO layer endows the CuO/Al system with a high
   energy-release rate and chemical reactivity. NiO can participate in a
   thermite reaction, which promotes the reaction of CuO/Al and induces the
   condensed phase.}},

Abstract = {{An efficient brucite@zinc borate (3ZnO center dot 3B(2)O(3)center dot
   3.5H(2)O) composite flame retardant (CFR), consisting of an incorporated
   nanostructure, is designed and synthesized via a simple and facile
   electrostatic adsorption route. It has been demonstrated that this
   incorporated system can enhance the interfacial interaction and improve
   the mechanical properties when used in ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA)
   composites. Meanwhile, in the process of burning, the CFR particles can
   successively migrate and accumulate to the surface of the burning zone,
   increasing the local concentration and rapidly generating a compact
   barrier layer through a condensed phase reinforcement mechanism even at
   a lower loading value. Especially, compared with the EVA/physical
   mixture (PM, with the same proportion of brucite and zinc borate), the
   heat release rate (HRR), the peak of the heat release rate (PHRR), the
   total heat released (THR), the smoke production rate (SPR), and mass
   loss are considerably reduced. According to this study, controlling the
   nanostructure of flame-retardant particles, to improve the condensed
   phase char layer, gives a new approach for the design of green flame
   retardants.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: to identify the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its
   associated factors in the elderly with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
   Methods: observational descriptive study conducted with elderly
   diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus, in the period 2017-2018,
   recruited at the Nutrition / Diabetes Outpatient Clinic of the Elderly
   Care Center of the Federal University of Pernambuco. Gender and age
   group were collected, and for the anthropometric evaluation of the
   participants, the body mass index and waist circumference were measured.
   We also collected the values of total cholesterol and fractions, as well
   as fasting glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin and previous diagnosis of
   hypertension. To analyze the obtained data, Student's t-test, Pearson's
   chi-square and Mann-Whitney test were used. For the analyzes, a
   confidence interval of 95\% and a significance level of 0.05 were
   adopted.
   Results: the sample consisted of 273 participants, with a mean age of
   68.77 +/- 5.65 years and 89.8\% (n=158) presented metabolic syndrome.
   The presence of this condition was associated with higher values of body
   weight (p=0.04), body mass index (p=0.003), waist circumference
   (p<0.001) and fasting blood glucose (p=0.007). Conclusions: there was a
   high prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the elderly studied with this
   condition associated with higher values of body weight, body mass index,
   waist circumference and fasting glucose. These findings demonstrate the
   importance of early identification and preventive intervention of these
   conditions in the elderly population, reducing morbidity and mortality
   due to cardiovascular events and improving the quality of life in the
   elderly.}},

Abstract = {{Background Thymoma-associated myasthenia gravis (TAMG) is one of the
   subtypes of myasthenia gravis with autoantibodies against the
   acetylcholine receptor (AChR-Ab). We analyzed the clinical features of
   our cohort of TAMG patients and the changes in AChR-Ab titer before and
   after thymectomy in order to identify factors predicting thymoma
   relapses.
   Methods We retrospectively assessed: age of MG onset, MG clinical status
   according to MGFA (Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America), epoch of
   thymectomy, post-thymectomy status, oncological features and surgical
   approach. AChR-Ab dosages were measured both before and after
   thymectomy. Linear regression models were applied to identify clinical
   determinants of AChR-Ab titers and the Cox regression model was fitted
   to estimate the factors associated with the risk of thymoma recurrence.
   Results The study sample included 239 MG patients, 27 of whom
   experienced one or more recurrences (median follow-up time: 4.8 years).
   The AChR-Ab titers decreased after first thymectomy (P < 0.001); the
   decrease was more pronounced in female patients (P = 0.05), in patients
   diagnosed with MG at an older age (P = 0.003), and in those who had
   lower MG stage before surgery (P = 0.02) or higher Masaoka-Koga stage (P
   = 0.005). The risk of relapse was closely linked with the age of the
   patient, the Masaoka-Koga stage and the surgical approach.
   Conclusions Presurgery levels of AChR-Ab or their change after surgery
   were not associated with thymoma recurrence. The reduction of AChR-Ab
   titers after thymectomy confirms an immunological role of thymoma in the
   pathogenesis of MG.
   Key points
   Significant findings of the study: Young MG patients with an advanced
   Masaoka staging score of the primary tumor who underwent thymectomy with
   approaches different from sternotomy and VATS should be monitored for
   high risk of recurrence.
   What this study adds: No other study has ever investigated the changes
   in AChR-Ab titers before and after thymectomy in a large cohort of TAMG
   patients. The reduction of AChR-Ab titers after thymectomy suggests an
   immunological role of thymoma in the pathogenesis of MG.}},

Abstract = {{Amphibians are models for studying applied ecological issues such as
   habitat loss, pollution, disease, and global climate change due to their
   sensitivity and vulnerability to changes in the environment.
   Developmental series of amphibians are informative about their biology,
   and X-ray based 3D reconstruction holds promise for quantifying
   morphological changes during growth-some with a direct impact on the
   possibility of an experimental investigation on several of the
   ecological topics listed above. However, 3D resolution and
   discrimination of their soft tissues have been difficult with
   traditional X-ray computed tomography, without time-consuming contrast
   staining. Tomographic data were initially performed (pre-processing and
   reconstruction) using the open-source software tool SYRMEP Tomo Project.
   Data processing and analysis of the reconstructed tomography volumes
   were conducted using the segmentation semi-automatic settings of the
   software Avizo Fire 8, which provide information about each investigated
   tissues, organs or bone elements. Hence, volumetric analyses were
   carried out to quantify the development of structures in different
   tadpole developmental stages. Our work shows that synchrotron X-ray
   microtomography using phase-contrast mode resolves the edges of the
   internal tissues (as well as overall tadpole morphology), facilitating
   the segmentation of the investigated tissues. Reconstruction algorithms
   and segmentation software played an important role in the qualitative
   and quantitative analysis of each target structure of the Thoropa
   miliaris tadpole at different stages of development, providing
   information on volume, shape and length. The use of the synchrotron
   X-ray microtomography setup of the SYRMEP beamline of Elettra
   Synchrotron, in phase-contrast mode, allows access to volumetric data
   for bone formation, eye development, nervous system and notochordal
   changes during the development (ontogeny) of tadpoles of a cycloramphid
   frog Thoropa miliaris. As key elements in the normal development of
   these and any other frog tadpole, the application of such a comparative
   ontogenetic study, may hold interest to researchers in experimental and
   environmental disciplines.}},

Title = {{Making moral machines: why we need artificial moral agents}},
Journal = {{AI \& SOCIETY}},
Abstract = {{As robots and Artificial Intelligences become more enmeshed in rich
   social contexts, it seems inevitable that we will have to make them into
   moral machines equipped with moral skills. Apart from the technical
   difficulties of how we could achieve this goal, we can also ask the
   ethical question of whether we should seek to create such Artificial
   Moral Agents (AMAs). Recently, several papers have argued that we have
   strong reasons not to develop AMAs. In response, we develop a
   comprehensive analysis of the relevant arguments for and against
   creating AMAs, and we argue that all things considered we have strong
   reasons to continue to responsibly develop AMAs. The key contributions
   of this paper are threefold. First, to provide the first comprehensive
   response to the important arguments made against AMAs by Wynsberghe and
   Robbins (in ``Critiquing the Reasons for Making Artificial Moral
   Agents{''}, Science and Engineering Ethics 25, 2019) and to introduce
   several novel lines of argument in the process. Second, to collate and
   thematise for the first time the key arguments for and against AMAs in a
   single paper. Third, to recast the debate away from blanket arguments
   for or against AMAs in general, to a more nuanced discussion about the
   use of what sort of AMAs, in what sort of contexts, and for what sort of
   purposes is morally appropriate.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{773-798}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In the United States, the ratio of consumption to GDP has risen steadily
   over the past half century. In trying to understand why this ratio has
   increased so much, it is argued that standard models of the consumption
   function, built up from the neoclassical theory of constrained
   optimization, cannot offer a satisfactory answer. An alternative
   perspective is offered whereby aggregate consumption expenditure is seen
   as primarily the outcome of the population adopting widely upheld rules
   ('meso-rules') in a complex economic system. Aggregate consumption is
   viewed as the outcome of two contrasting historical processes: one
   mainly involving pre-committed, rule-bound choices and the other
   involving open-ended choices, made knowingly in the face of uncertainty,
   to adopt new meso-rules concerning the consumption of novel kinds of
   goods and services. The former process provides the degree of order that
   must be present in any complex system and the latter facilitates
   evolutionary change to occur. Using over half a century of data, the US
   consumption function is modelled successfully on the presumption that
   the economy is a complex system. The evidence supports the hypothesis
   that the ratio of consumption to GDP has risen because of the diffusion
   of a `culture of consumerism' in the post-war era and that the limit of
   this process is now being approached, with important macroeconomic and
   social implications.}},

Abstract = {{Amphiphilic assemblies made from diverse synthetic building blocks are
   well known for their biomedical applications. Here, we report the
   synthesis of gemini-type amphiphilic molecules that form stable
   assemblies in water. The assembly property of molecule M2 in aqueous
   solutions was first inferred from peak broadening observed in the proton
   NMR spectrum. This was supported by dynamic light scattering and
   transmission electron microscopy analysis. The assembly formed from M2
   (M2(agg)) was used to solubilize the hydrophobic drugs curcumin and
   doxorubicin at physiological pH. M2(agg) was able to effectively
   solubilize curcumin as well as protect it from degradation under UV
   irradiation. Upon solubilization in M2(agg), curcumin showed excellent
   cell permeability and higher toxicity to cancer cells over normal cells,
   probably because of enhanced cellular uptake and increased stability.
   M2(agg) also showed pH-dependent release of doxorubicin, resulting in
   controlled toxicity on cancer cell lines, making it a promising
   candidate for the selective delivery of drugs to cancer cells.}},

Abstract = {{Source-specific health risk apportionment for heavy metals is critical
   for pollution prevention and risk management in mining and smelting
   areas. An integrated method combining health risk assessments with the
   positive matrix factorization model was proposed to evaluate
   source-specific health risks for adults and children. A typical mining
   and smelting area was taken as an example in the present study to
   apportion the source-specific health risks to humans. A total of 37 road
   dust samples collected from the industrial (IA) and residential areas
   (RA) of Gejiu (China) were analyzed for heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni,
   Pb, and Zn). The results indicated that road dust in the study area was
   mainly contaminated with Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn. Three potential sources,
   including atmospheric deposition, industrial waste, and natural sources,
   were identified and quantified, with contributions of 43.32\%, 30.83\%,
   and 25.85\%, respectively. For non-carcinogenic risks, a similar trend
   of the source contribution was found for adults and children under the
   same land use; atmospheric deposition made the greatest contribution to
   the non-carcinogenic risk in both IA and RA. However, for carcinogenic
   risk, natural sources were the greatest contributor to human health
   risks in both IA and RA, followed by atmospheric deposition and
   industrial waste. The investigation in this study allowed the evaluation
   of health risks from potential contamination sources and the results
   provide valuable information on health risk mitigation strategies for
   environmental managers.}},

Abstract = {{The present study was carried out to evaluate the diversity of rhizobia
   associated with nodules of mung bean in Pakistan, because this
   information is necessary for inoculum development. Based on sequence
   analysis of 16S rRNA gene of thirty-one bacteria, 11 were assigned to
   genus Bradyrhizobium, 17 to Ensifer, and 3 to Rhizobium. Phylogenetic
   analyses on the basis of 16S-23S ITS region, atpD, recA, nifH, and nodA
   of representative strains revealed that B. yuanmingense is the
   predominant species distributed throughout different mung bean-growing
   areas. Among the fast-growing rhizobia, Ensifer aridi was predominant in
   Faisalabad, Layyah, and Rawalpindi, while E. meliloti in Thal desert.
   Sequence variations and phylogeny of nifH and nodA genes suggested that
   these genes might have been co-evolved with the housekeeping genes and
   maintained by vertical gene transfer in rhizobia detected in the present
   study. Host infectivity assay revealed the successful nodulation of host
   by rhizobia related to genera Bradyrhizobium, Ensifer and Rhizobium.
   Among all, Bradyrhizobium and Ensifer spp. inoculation exhibited a
   significantly higher number of nodules (11-34 nodules plant(-1)) and
   nitrogenase activity (nodule ARA 60-110 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)). Contrary to
   the previous studies, our data reveal that B. yuanmingense and E. aridi
   are predominant species forming effective nodules in mung bean in
   Pakistan. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first
   report showing the effective symbiosis of E. aridi, E. meliloti, and
   Rhizobium pusense with mung bean. The diversity of rhizobia in different
   habitats revealed in the present study will contribute towards designing
   site-specific inocula for mung bean.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIOR GENETICS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{51}},

Pages = {{58-67}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The relationship between genetic and environmental risk is complex and
   for many traits, estimates of genetic effects may be inflated by passive
   gene-environment correlation. This arises because biological offspring
   inherit both their genotypes and rearing environment from their parents.
   We tested for passive gene-environment correlation in adult body
   composition traits using the `natural experiment' of childhood adoption,
   which removes passive gene-environment correlation within families.
   Specifically, we compared 6165 adoptees with propensity score matched
   non-adoptees in the UK Biobank. We also tested whether passive
   gene-environment correlation inflates the association between
   psychiatric genetic risk and body composition. We found no evidence for
   inflation of heritability or polygenic scores in non-adoptees compared
   to adoptees for a range of body composition traits. Furthermore,
   polygenic risk scores for anorexia nervosa,
   attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and schizophrenia did not
   differ in their influence on body composition traits in adoptees and
   non-adoptees. These findings suggest that passive gene-environment
   correlation does not inflate genetic effects for body composition, or
   the influence of psychiatric disorder genetic risk on body composition.
   Our design does not look at passive gene-environment correlation in
   childhood, and does not test for `pure' environmental effects or the
   effects of active and evocative gene-environment correlations, where
   child genetics directly influences home environment. However, these
   findings suggest that genetic influences identified for body composition
   in this adult sample are direct, and not confounded by the family
   environment provided by biological relatives.}},

   with systemic lupus erythematosus, it has been rarely reported in
   patients with SS. Herein, we present a case of SS with catatonia
   effectively and safely treated with modified electroconvulsive therapy
   (ECT). A 58-year-old woman showed prolonged catatonia and depressive
   mood along with pathologically dried eye and mouth. Based on physical
   findings and blood tests, she was diagnosed with SS. Because of the
   presence of pressure sores, we were unable to perform lumbar puncture
   for the diagnosis of abacterial encephalitis. Alternatively,
   single-photon emission computed tomography of her brain revealed
   multifocal hypoperfused areas in the parietotemporal region.
   Consequently, we performed ECT for the treatment of catatonia comorbid
   with SS. Following 20 sessions of ECT, the catatonia was improved
   without obvious adverse effects. One week after the last ECT, elevated
   levels of interleukin-6 were identified in the cerebral fluid. After
   receiving steroid pulse therapy, she has not experienced catatonia for
   more than 5 years. SS can cause catatonia, and ECT is a safe and
   effective option for the treatment of catatonia with SS.}},

Abstract = {{Bat cells and tissue have elevated basal expression levels of antiviral
   genes commonly associated with interferon alpha (IFN alpha) signaling.
   Here, we show Interferon Regulatory Factor 1 (IRF1), 3, and 7 levels are
   elevated in most bat tissues and that, basally, IRFs contribute to the
   expression of type I IFN ligands and high expression of interferon
   regulated genes (IRGs). CRISPR knockout (KO) of IRF 1/3/7 in cells
   reveals distinct subsets of genes affected by each IRF in an IFN-ligand
   signaling-dependent and largely independent manner. As the master
   regulators of innate immunity, the IRFs control the kinetics and
   maintenance of the IRG response and play essential roles in response to
   influenza A virus (IAV), herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV- 1), Melaka
   virus/Pteropine orthoreovirus 3 Melaka (PRV3M), and Middle East
   respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. With its
   differential expression in bats compared to that in humans, this
   highlights a critical role for basal IRF expression in viral responses
   and potentially immune cell development in bats with relevance for IRF
   function in human biology.}},

Abstract = {{The regulation of actin is key for controlled cellular function.
   Filaments are regulated by actin-binding proteins, but the nucleotide
   state of actin is also an important factor. From extended molecular
   dynamics simulations, we find that both nucleotide states of the actin
   monomer have significantly less twist than their crystal structures and
   that the ATP monomer is flatter than the ADP form. We also find that the
   filament's pointed end is flatter than the remainder of the filament and
   has a conformation distinct from G-actin, meaning that incoming monomers
   would need to undergo isomerization that would weaken the affinity and
   slow polymerization. Conversely, the barbed end of the filament takes on
   a conformation nearly identical to the ATP monomer, enhancing ATP
   G-actin's ability to polymerize as compared with ADP G-actin. The
   thermodynamic penalty imposed by differences in isomerization for the
   ATP and ADP growth at the barbed end exactly matches experimental
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Heterotrophic denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to
   ammonium (DNRA) are two microbial processes competing for two shared
   resources, namely, nitrate and organic carbon (COD). Their competition
   has great implications for nitrogen loss, conservation, and greenhouse
   gas emissions. Nevertheless, a comprehensive and mechanistic
   understanding of the governing factors for this competition is still
   lacking. We applied the resource-ratio theory to study this competition
   and validated the theory with experimental data from continuous cultures
   reported in the literature. Based on this theory, we revealed that
   influent COD/N ratio alone was not sufficient to predict the competition
   outcome as the boundary values for different competition outcomes
   changed substantially with influent resource concentrations. The
   stoichiometry of the two processes was determinative for the boundaries,
   whereas the affinity for the shared resources (K-S), maximum specific
   growth rate (mu(max)) of the two species, and the dilution rate had
   significant impacts as well but mainly at low influent resource
   concentrations (e.g., <100 mu M nitrate). The presented approach allows
   for a more comprehensive understanding of the parameters controlling
   microbial competition. The computational comparison between continuous
   and batch cultures could explain seemingly conflicting experimental
   results as to the impact of the COD/N ratio. The results also include
   testable hypotheses and tools for understanding and managing the fate of
   nitrate in ecosystems, which could also be applied more widely to other
   species competing for two shared resources.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{45}},

Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{Segregation distortion refers to an unusual genetic phenomenon in
   diploid organisms by which the two alleles at a locus in a parent are
   not recovered in the classical 1:1 Mendelian ratio in its offspring. The
   Drosophila melanogaster neogene Sd was created by a duplication
   breakpoint on the left arm of chromosome 2 (2L), and encodes a truncated
   RanGAP protein with normal GTPase activity but which mis-localizes to
   the nucleus and disrupts Ran gradients. Male flies carrying Sd exhibit
   segregation distortion for the Rsp locus on the right arm of chromosome
   2 (2R). Specifically, spermatids inheriting chromosome 2 with the
   Sd(+)Rsp(s(s)) genotype, in heterozygous males of genotype Sd Rsp(i)
   /Sd(+)Rsp(s(s)), fail to develop properly so that the majority of
   progeny (approaching 100\%) carry just the Sd Rsp(i) chromosome. One
   recent paper reported novel RNAi-expressing transgenes with Sd-mimicking
   properties; and another reported localization of an X-linked suppressor
   which restores Mendelian transmission. This article highlights how
   Drosophila genetics resources made this possible, and the significance
   of these findings to nucleus-cytoplasm transactions of interest to the
   wider cell biology community.}},

Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1272-1289}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a case-based degrowth critique of sustainable urban
   development strategies. Copenhagen, European Green Capital in 2014, is
   considered a role model of planning for sustainability. Does this hold
   in a degrowth perspective? Sustainable development assumes that
   environmental impacts can decline while the economy grows. Degrowth
   maintains that such a process of absolute decoupling is infeasible.
   Analyzing Copenhagen's planning documents in this perspective, I find
   three factors that make the city's sustainability strategy ineffective
   for ecological sustainability. First, Copenhagen's strategy for climate
   neutrality is based on externalization: only emissions produced locally
   are counted. Meanwhile, emissions produced outside of the city for
   products and services consumed locally remain high. Secondly, policies
   focus on the efficiency of activities rather than their overall impact:
   efficiency gains are considered reductions of impact, but really mean
   slower growth of impact. Finally, sustainability measures are proposed
   as a `green fix', to increase competitiveness and promote economic
   growth, leading to increased consumption and impact. Analyzing the
   critical case of Copenhagen in a degrowth perspective, sheds doubts on
   sustainable urban development, but does not imply the rejection of all
   its typical planning measures. This induces reflections on how these
   results can contribute to a degrowth-oriented urban planning.}},

Journal = {{DISCOURSE-STUDIES IN THE CULTURAL POLITICS OF EDUCATION}},
Abstract = {{The article explores the potential of theory in expanding how we can
   think about a globalization that can encompass the affirmation of
   diversity. This happens at a critical time, when policy areas, including
   education, are constrained by a global mode of neoliberal predatory
   capitalism that is in turn confronted by a return to national(ist)
   solutions. The article takes a Deleuzian approach to exploring
   potentials and pitfalls in a vision of practising globalization that
   goes beyond the poor human-capital vision of globalization and narrow
   nationalist visions of identity politics that continually haunt
   education. The article addresses diversity and capitalism by activating
   the Deleuzian concepts of the war machine, nomadic strategies and
   practices of joy and sadness. The concept of the multitude, drawn from
   Hardt and Negri, supplies additional theorization facilitating the

Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{102}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The ubiquitous oceanic copepod Calanus finmarchicus is the major link
   between primary producers and important fish stocks in the North
   Atlantic Ocean and adjacent seas. Despite over a century of research on
   growth and development of this key species, the effect of predation risk
   on these processes remains elusive. We tested how food level and
   chemical cues from a fish predator influence growth and development of
   C. finmarchicus, using a predator naive laboratory population. Copepods
   reached adult stage earlier both in response to high food and to
   predator cues in our experiment. High food also increased growth and
   lipid accumulation. In contrast, perceived predation risk triggered
   reduced size and lipid fullness, indicating a decoupling of growth and
   development rates. Our results demonstrate that chemical predator cues
   can influence life history strategies in C. finmarchicus, and suggest
   that present and future patterns in oceanic zooplankton size and
   population dynamics may also reflect differences in predation risk.}},

Abstract = {{The mononuclear phagocyte (MP) system consists of macrophages,
   monocytes, and dendritic cells (DCs). MP subtypes play distinct
   functional roles in steady-state and inflammatory conditions. Although
   murine MPs are well characterized, their pulmonary and lymph node (LN)
   human homologs remain poorly understood. To address this gap, we have
   created a gene expression compendium across 24 distinct human and murine
   lung and LN MPs, along with human blood and murine spleen MPs, to serve
   as validation datasets. In-depth RNA sequencing identifies corresponding
   human-mouse MPsubtypes and determines marker genes shared and divergent
   across species. Unexpectedly, only 13\%-23\% of the top 1,000 marker
   genes (i.e., genes not shared across species-specific MP subtypes)
   overlap in corresponding human-mouse MP counterparts. Lastly, CD88 in
   both species helps distinguish monocytes/macrophages from DCs. Our
   cross-species expression compendium serves as a resource for future
   translational studies to investigate beforehand whether pursuing
   specific MP subtypes or genes will prove fruitful.}},

Volume = {{64}},

Abstract = {{Allergic asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the lung and the
   airway, which is characterized by aberrant type 2 immune responses to
   otherwise unharmful aeroallergens. While the central role of Th2 cells
   and type 2 cytokines in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma is well
   documented, the regulation and plasticity of Th2 cells remain
   incompletely understood. By using an animal model of allergic asthma in
   IL-4-reporter mice, we found that Th2 cells in the lung expressed higher
   levels of Rora than those in the lymph nodes, and that treatment with an
   ROR alpha agonist SR1078 resulted in diminished Th2 cell responses in
   vivo. To determine the T cell-intrinsic role of ROR alpha in allergic
   asthma in vivo, we established T cell-specific ROR alpha-deficient
   (Cd4creRora(f/f)) mice. Upon intranasal allergen challenges,
   Cd4creRora(f/f) mice exhibited a significantly increased Th2 cells in
   the lungs and the airway and showed an enhanced eosinophilic
   inflammation compared to littermate control mice. Studies with
   Foxp3(YFP-cre)Rora(f/f) mice and CD8(+) T cell depletion showed that the
   increased Th2 cell responses in the Cd4creRora(f/f) mice were
   independent of Treg cells and CD8(+) T cells. Our findings demonstrate a
   critical regulatory role of ROR alpha in Th2 cells, which suggest that
   ROR alpha agonists could be effective for the treatment of allergic
   diseases.}},

Abstract = {{The recently proposed q-rung orthopair fuzzy set, which is characterized
   by a membership degree and a non-membership degree, is effective for
   handling uncertainty and vagueness. This paper proposes the concept of
   complex q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (Cq-ROFS) and their operational
   laws. A multi-attribute decision making (MADM) method with complex
   q-rung orthopair fuzzy information is investigated. To aggregate complex
   q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers, we extend the Einstein operations to
   Cq-ROFSs and propose a family of complex q-rung orthopair fuzzy Einstein
   averaging operators, such as the complex q-rung orthopair fuzzy Einstein
   weighted averaging operator, the complex q-rung orthopair fuzzy Einstein
   ordered weighted averaging operator, the generalized complex q-rung
   orthopair fuzzy Einstein weighted averaging operator, and the
   generalized complex q-rung orthopair fuzzy Einstein ordered weighted
   averaging operator. Desirable properties and special cases of the
   introduced operators are discussed. Further, we develop a novel MADM
   approach based on the proposed operators in a complex q-rung orthopair
   fuzzy context. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the
   effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method through a detailed
   comparison with existing methods.}},

Abstract = {{Organophosphate esters (OPEs) represent an important group of industrial
   additives with broad applications. However, their occurrences and fate
   in the atmospheric environment have not been sufficiently investigated.
   Our study focused on four novel OPEs, including
   tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphate (AO168 = O),
   bis(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) pentaerythritol diphosphate, triisodecyl
   phosphate, and trisnonylphenol phosphate, and characterized their
   organophosphite antioxidant (OPA) precursors and selected transformation
   products, in airborne fine particles from South China. House dust from
   South China was also studied for comparison. Among these four OPEs,
   exceedingly high concentrations were determined for AO168 = O (i.e.,
   median: 25 500 ng/g in PM2.5, 52 900 ng/g in PM1.0, and 10 700 ng/g in
   indoor dust), reaching 1 order of magnitude greater than those of
   traditional OPEs. Their OPA precursors were not detectable in airborne
   particles but hypothesized as one of the sources for airborne OPEs. In
   addition, potential transformation products of AO168 = O, including
   bis(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphate (B2,4DtBPP) and
   2,4-di-tert-butylphenol (2,4DtBP), also exhibited broad distributions.
   The levels of 2,4DtBP even surpassed those of AO168 = O in particles.
   The links between OPAs, OPEs, and other transformation products indicate
   the complexity of OPE-related chemicals in atmospheric environments.
   These links should be taken into consideration for a better
   characterization of OPEs' environmental and health risks.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To identify the strategies to prevent missed nursing care (MNC) that
   can be implemented by nurse managers/directors on a daily basis.
   Background Only few recommendations have been established to date aiming
   at supporting nurse managers/ directors in preventing MNC. However,
   several strategies are implemented on a daily basis, suggesting that a
   body of tacit, practical and wise knowledge is already in place.
   Method(s) An international qualitative descriptive study based on the
   positive deviance approach conducted in 2019-2020 and reported according
   to the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research. A
   purposeful sample of 35 nurse managers/directors working in hospitals in
   Cyprus, Italy, Germany and Switzerland was involved. Codes were
   extracted from each country, and a thematic analysis was performed at
   the transnational level to identify strategies and interventions
   preformed to prevent MNC.
   Results Eight strategies and 22 interventions, mainly with preventive
   intent and designed at the hospital level, affecting both the processes
   and the structural dimensions, have been reported as effective in
   preventing MNC.
   Conclusion Nurse leaders are involved daily in implementing strategies
   to minimise MNC at the nursing and at the hospital system levels,
   integrated with each other.
   Implications for Nursing Management Preventing MNC should be a core
   value of the entire hospital, and not merely a nursing issue. Therefore,
   complex interventions at the system level are required.}},

Abstract = {{The past nine months witnessed COVID-19's fast-spreading at the global
   level. Limited by medical resources shortage and uneven facilities
   distribution, online help-seeking becomes an essential approach to cope
   with public health emergencies for many ordinaries. This study explores
   the driving forces behind the retransmission of online help-seeking
   posts. We built an analytical framework that emphasized content
   characteristics, including information completeness, proximity, support
   seeking type, disease severity, and emotion of help-seeking messages. A
   quantitative content analysis was conducted with a probability sample
   consisting of 727 posts. The results illustrate the importance of
   individual information completeness, high proximity, instrumental
   support seeking. This study also demonstrates slight inconformity with
   the severity principle but stresses the power of anger in help-seeking
   messages dissemination. As one of the first online help-seeking
   diffusion analyses in the COVID-19 period, our research provides a
   reference for constructing compelling and effective help-seeking posts
   during a particular period. It also reveals further possibilities for
   harnessing social media's power to promote reciprocal and cooperative
   actions as a response to this deepening global concern.}},

Abstract = {{The amide functionality is one of the most important and widely used
   groups in nature and in medicinal and industrial chemistry. Because of
   its importance and as the actual synthetic methods suffer from major
   drawbacks, such as the use of a stoichiometric amount of an activating
   agent, epimerization and low atom economy, the development of new and
   efficient amide bond forming reactions is needed. A number of greener
   and more effective strategies have been studied and developed. The
   transamidation of primary amides is particularly attractive in terms of
   atom economy and as ammonia is the single byproduct. This review
   summarizes the advancements in metal-catalyzed and organocatalyzed
   transamidation methods. Lewis and Bronsted acid transamidation catalysts
   are reviewed as a separate group. The activation of primary amides by
   promoter, as well as catalyst- and promoter-free protocols, are also
   described. The proposed mechanisms and key intermediates of the depicted
   transamidation reactions are shown.}},

Title = {{Crank length alters kinematics and kinetics, yet not the economy of
   recumbent handcyclists at constant handgrip speeds}},

Volume = {{31}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Handcycling performance is dependent on the physiological economy of the
   athlete; however, handbike configuration and the biomechanical
   interaction between the two are also vital. The purpose of this study
   was to examine the effect of crank length manipulations on physiological
   and biomechanical aspects of recumbent handcycling performance in highly
   trained recumbent handcyclists at a constant linear handgrip speed and
   sport-specific intensity. Nine competitive handcyclists completed a
   3-minute trial in an adjustable recumbent handbike in four crank length
   settings (150, 160, 170 \& 180 mm) at 70\% peak power output. Handgrip
   speed was controlled (1.6 m center dot s(-1)) across trials with
   cadences ranging from 102 to 85 rpm. Physiological economy, heart rate,
   and ratings of perceived exertion were monitored in all trials.
   Handcycling kinetics were quantified using an SRM (Schoberer Rad
   Messtechnik) powermeter, and upper limb kinematics were determined using
   a 10-camera VICON motion capture system. Physiological responses were
   not significantly affected by crank length. However, greater torque was
   generated (P < .0005) and peak torque occurred earlier during the push
   and pull phase (P <= .001) in longer cranks. Statistical parametric
   mapping revealed that the timing and orientation of shoulder flexion,
   shoulder abduction, and elbow extension were significantly altered in
   different crank lengths. Despite the biomechanical adaptations, these
   findings suggest that at constant handgrip speeds (and varying cadence)
   highly trained handcyclists may select crank lengths between 150 and 180
   mm without affecting their physiological performance. Until further
   research, factors such as anthropometrics, comfort, and self-selected
   cadence should be used to facilitate crank length selection in recumbent
   handcyclists.}},

Journal = {{BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{Background There is strong evidence that women with gestational diabetes
   mellitus (GDM) who receive a minimum of three appointments with a
   dietitian may require medication less often. The aim of this study was
   to evaluate the impact of a dietitian-led model of care on clinical
   outcomes and to understand the utility of the integrated Promoting
   Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS)
   framework as a prospective tool for implementation. Methods This was a
   pre-post intervention study measuring outcomes before-and-after changing
   a gestational diabetes (GDM) model of care and included women with GDM
   managed at a large, regional hospital in Queensland, Australia. The
   i-PARIHS framework was used to develop, implement and evaluate a
   dietitian-led model of care which increased dietetic input for women
   with GDM to a minimum of one initial education and two review
   appointments. The outcomes were adherence to the schedule of
   appointments, clinician perspective of the implementation process,
   pharmacotherapy use, gestational age at commencement of pharmacotherapy
   and birth weight. Pre- and post- comparisons of outcomes were made using
   t-tests and chi-squared tests. Results Adherence to the dietetic
   schedule of appointments was significantly increased from 29 to 82\% (p
   < 0.001) but pharmacotherapy use also increased by 10\% (p = 0.10).
   There were significantly more women in the post-intervention group who
   were diagnosed with GDM prior to 24 weeks gestation, a strong
   independent predictor of pharmacotherapy use. Infant birthweight
   remained unchanged. The i-PARIHS framework was used as a diagnostic tool
   and checklist in the model of care development phase; a facilitation
   tool during the implementation phase; and during the evaluation phase
   was used as a reflection tool to identify how the i-PARIHS constructs
   and their interactions that may have impacted on clinical outcomes.
   Conclusions The i-PARIHS framework was found to be useful in the
   development, implementation and evaluation of a dietitian-led model of
   care which saw almost 90\% of women with GDM meet the minimum schedule
   of dietetic appointments.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{The mass usage of veterinary pharmaceuticals in farms has contributed to
   environmental pollution in vicinity waters, soils, and sediments from
   farms and composting facilities. In the present study, we investigated
   the usage of four antibiotics (viz., lincomycin, sulfamethazine,
   sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim) to understand their contamination
   routes from livestock manure piles. Residual levels of these antibiotics
   in a nearby reservoir were set as a positive control (Site 1), and a
   swine manure pile in a farm (Site 2) and a soil sample around the manure
   pile (Site 3) were selected for this study. Artificial rainwater was
   flowed into the manure sample (Site 2), the soil sample around the
   manure pile (Site 3), and a soil sample around the vicinity river (Site
   4). A stream sample (Site 5) around the manure pile and river water near
   the manure pile (Site 6) were also collected. For qualitative and
   quantitative analyses, analytical validation was performed, and all the
   four antibiotics were detected at Site 1 in the concentration range of
   0.03-1.6 mu g/L. Lincomycin was the antibiotic with the highest
   detection level. At Site 2, the detection level of all antibiotics
   remained at 0.3-17.3 mu g/L, and their residual amounts were
   continuously detected in subsequent samples with approximately 30-fold
   decrease. The migration of antibiotics was confirmed to be independent
   of pH value. Therefore, this study indicates that farm manure pile
   should be thoroughly managed for antibiotic contamination in vicinity
   areas with periodical monitoring, especially waterways.}},

Title = {{High-Dose Glucagon Has Hemodynamic Effects Regardless of Cardiac
   Beta-Adrenoceptor Blockade: A Randomized Clinical Trial}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Intravenous high-dose glucagon is a recommended antidote
   against beta-blocker poisonings, but clinical effects are unclear. We
   therefore investigated hemodynamic effects and safety of high-dose
   glucagon with and without concomitant beta-blockade.
   METHODS AND RESULTS: In a randomized crossover study, 10 healthy men
   received combinations of esmolol (1.25 mg/kg bolus+0.75 mg/kg/min
   infusion), glucagon (50 mu g/kg), and identical volumes of saline
   placebo on 5 separate days in random order (saline+saline;
   esmolol+saline; esmolol+glucagon bolus; saline+glucagon infusion;
   saline+glucagon bolus). On individual days, esmolol/saline was infused
   from -15 to 30 minutes. Glucagon/saline was administered from 0 minutes
   as a 2-minute intravenous bolus or as a 30-minute infusion (same total
   glucagon dose). End points were hemodynamic and adverse effects of
   glucagon compared with saline. Compared with saline, glucagon bolus
   increased mean heart rate by 13.0 beats per minute (95\% CI, 8.0-18.0;
   P0.001), systolic blood pressure by 15.6 mm Hg (95\% CI, 8.0-23.2;
   P=0.002), diastolic blood pressure by 9.4 mm Hg (95\% CI, 6.3-12.6;
   P0.001), and cardiac output by 18.0 \% (95\% CI, 9.7-26.9; P=0.003) at
   the 5-minute time point on days without beta-blockade. Similar effects
   of glucagon bolus occurred on days with beta-blockade and between 15 and
   30 minutes during infusion. Hemodynamic effects of glucagon thus
   reflected pharmacologic glucagon plasma concentrations. Glucagon-induced
   nausea occurred in 80\% of participants despite ondansetron
   pretreatment.
   CONCLUSIONS: High-dose glucagon boluses had significant hemodynamic
   effects regardless of beta-blockade. A glucagon infusion had comparable
   and apparently longer-lasting effects compared with bolus, indicating
   that infusion may be preferable to bolus injections.}},

Abstract = {{Session notes are a required component of documenting behavior analytic
   sessions. The direct training of writing objective session notes is
   important to the success of direct line staff completing adequate
   documentation and meeting requirements set forth by agencies,
   certification boards, and insurance funders. However, in-person training
   is not always immediately available due to contextual restrictions. This
   study evaluated the effectiveness of implementing the teaching
   interaction procedure when training staff remotely to objectively
   document client progress within session notes. Three Registered Behavior
   Technicians (TM) (RBT (R) s) were trained via telehealth to complete
   session notes objectively. Results showed that all 3 participants met
   the mastery criterion during probes measuring the objective
   documentation of home-based behavior analytic sessions. These findings
   suggest that a training package, such as the teaching interaction
   procedure, can be effectively implemented remotely when conducting staff
   training.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Fibrinogen is considered a marker of vascular pathology,
   indicating a weakened blood-brain barrier, and has a causative role in
   neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Little is known about the
   relationship between fibrinogen levels and cognitive function in
   patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We aimed to investigate
   differences in cognitive profiles according to plasma fibrinogen levels
   in patients with MCI and the influence of plasma fibrinogen levels on
   cognitive decline. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 643
   patients with MCI: 323 patients in the high fibrinogen (high fib) group
   and 320 patients in the low fibrinogen (low fib) group. A multiple
   linear regression model was performed to compare cognitive test
   performance between groups. The Cox proportional hazard model was used
   to analyze the hazard ratio of fibrinogen level for disease progression.
   Results: The high fib group demonstrated poorer performance in
   attention, executive function, and confrontation naming than the low fib
   group. After adjustment for APOE genotype, the high fib group was
   associated with poor attention and executive function. After adjustment
   for vascular risk factors including body mass index, hypertension,
   diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and smoking history, the high fib group
   showed declined attention and confrontation naming ability. High
   fibrinogen levels did not predict disease progression to CDR 1.
   Conclusion: High plasma fibrinogen levels were associated with poor
   performance in attention in patients with MCI, regardless of APOE
   genotype or vascular risk factors.}},

Title = {{Nonpharmacologic and Pharmacologic Management of Acute Pain From Non-Low
   Back, Musculoskeletal Injuries in Adults: A Clinical Guideline From the
   American College of Physicians and American Academy of Family Physicians}},

Abstract = {{Description: The American College of Physicians (ACP) and American
   Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) developed this guideline to provide
   clinical recommendations on nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic
   management of acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries in
   adults in the outpatient setting. The guidance is based on current best
   available evidence about benefits and harms, taken in the context of
   costs and patient values and preferences. This guideline does not
   address noninvasive treatment of low back pain, which is covered by a
   separate ACP guideline that has also been endorsed by AAFP.
   Methods: This guideline is based on a systematic evidence review on the
   comparative efficacy and safety of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic
   management of acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries in
   adults in the outpatient setting and a systematic review on the
   predictors of prolonged opioid use. We evaluated the following clinical
   outcomes using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment,
   Development and Evaluation) system: pain (at <= 2 hours and at 1 to 7
   days), physical function, symptom relief, treatment satisfaction, and
   adverse events.
   Target Audience and Patient Population: The target audience is all
   clinicians, and the target patient population is adults with acute pain
   from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries.
   Recommendation 1: ACP and AAFP recommend that clinicians treat patients
   with acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries with topical
   nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with or without menthol
   gel as first-line therapy to reduce or relieve symptoms, including pain;
   improve physical function; and improve the patient's treatment
   satisfaction (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-certainty
   evidence).
   Recommendation 2a: ACP and AAFP suggest that clinicians treat patients
   with acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries with oral
   NSAIDs to reduce or relieve symptoms, including pain, and to improve
   physical function, or with oral acetaminophen to reduce pain (Grade:
   conditional recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence).
   Recommendation 2b: ACP and AAFP suggest that clinicians treat patients
   with acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries with
   specific acupressure to reduce pain and improve physical function, or
   with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation to reduce pain (Grade:
   conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).
   Recommendation 3: ACP and AAFP suggest against clinicians treating
   patients with acute pain from non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries
   with opioids, including tramadol (Grade: conditional recommendation;
   low-certainty evidence).}},

Journal = {{BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{43}},
Pages = {{4148-4154}},

Abstract = {{The transcriptional co-activator with the PDZ binding motif (TAZ) is a
   critical regulator of numerous cellular processes such as cell
   differentiation, development, proliferation, and cell growth. Aberrant
   expression and activity of TAZ are also featured in many human
   malignancies. A hallmark of TAZ biology is its cytoplasmic retention
   mediated by 14-3-3 isoforms in response to phosphorylation of Ser(89) by
   members of the LATS family of kinases. Following the observation that
   TAZ is a highly phosphorylated protein even when Ser(89) is mutated,
   high-resolution mass spectrometry employing data-independent acquisition
   and ion mobility separation was conducted to elucidate additional TAZ
   phosphorylation sites that may play a role in regulating this critical
   transcriptional rheostat. Numerous phosphorylation sites on TAZ were
   identified, including several novel modifications. Of notable interest
   was the identification of positional phosphoisomers on a phosphopeptide
   containing Ser(89). Optimized use of a socalled wideband enhancement
   acquisition technique yielded higher-quality fragmentation data that
   confirmed the detection of Ser(93) as the positional phosphoisomer
   partner of Ser(89) and identified diagnostic fragment ions for the
   phosphorylation events. Functional analysis indicated that Ser(93)
   phosphorylation reduces the level of 14-3-3 association and increases
   the level of nuclear translocation, indicating this phosphorylation
   event attenuates the 14-3-3-mediated TAZ cytoplasmic retention
   mechanism. These findings suggest that the biological activities of TAZ
   are likely dynamically regulated by multisite phosphorylation.}},

Abstract = {{In patients with aortic coarctation it would be desirable to assess
   pressure gradients as well as information about blood flow profiles at
   rest and during exercise. We aimed to assess the hemodynamic responses
   to physical exercise by combining MRI-ergometry with computational fluid
   dynamics (CFD). MRI was performed on 20 patients with aortic coarctation
   (13 men, 7 women, mean age 21.5 +/- 13.7 years) at rest and during
   ergometry. Peak systolic pressure gradients, wall shear stress (WSS),
   secondary flow degree (SFD) and normalized flow displacement (NFD) were
   calculated using CFD. Stroke volume was determined based on MRI. On
   average, the pressure gradient was 18.0 +/- 16.6 mmHg at rest and
   increased to 28.5 +/- 22.6 mmHg (p < 0.001) during exercise. A
   significant increase in cardiac index was observed (p < 0.001), which
   was mainly driven by an increase in heart rate (p < 0.001). WSS
   significantly increased during exercise (p = 0.006), whereas SFD and NFD
   remained unchanged. The combination of MRI-ergometry with CFD allows
   assessing pressure gradients as well as flow profiles during physical
   exercise. This concept has the potential to serve as an alternative to
   cardiac catheterization with pharmacological stress testing and provides
   hemodynamic information valuable for studying the pathophysiology of
   aortic coarctation.}},

Abstract = {{In general, the design of complex polycycles from simple building blocks
   is challenging and requires many reaction steps. Herein, we present that
   complex polycycles can be synthesized starting from two alkyne building
   blocks in a one-pot reaction using gold(I) as catalyst, in yields up to
   77 \%. Mechanistically, the process can be described as cascade reaction
   in two steps: first, the allene is formed by gold(I)-catalyzed
   dearomatization, second, the desired product is then obtained by
   allene-diene-alkyne coupling. Quantum chemical investigations confirm
   the assumed mechanism. In sum, five new C-C bonds are built in one
   sweep, which is extraordinary since non-identical building blocks are
   combined in this reaction. The introduced new allene-diene-alkyne
   coupling reaction paves the way for several new syntheses of cycles and
   polycycles considering potential intermolecular reactions.}},

Abstract = {{Aluminum-air batteries possess high theoretical specific capacities and
   energy densities. However, the desired application performance in the
   field of flexible electronics is limited by the rigid battery structure
   and slow kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). To address
   these issues, flexible, stretchable, and customizable aluminum-air
   batteries with a reference to honeycomb shape are composed of multilayer
   single battery units to achieve large scalability and start-stop
   control. The single aluminum-air battery combines MnO2 with N/S codoped
   graphene to improve the electrocatalytic activity. Benefiting from an
   efficient electrocatalyst and reasonable structural design, the single
   aluminum-air battery exhibits excellent electrochemical characteristics
   under deformation conditions with a high specific capacity and energy
   density (1203.2 mAh g(-1) Al and 1630.1 mWh g(-1) Al). Furthermore, the
   obtained honeycomb-shaped stretchable aluminum-air batteries maintain a
   stable output voltage over the 2500\% stretching. More interestingly,
   the stretchable honeycomb structure not only can solve the start-stop
   control problem but also has the potential to reduce the self-corrosion
   in disposable metal-air batteries. In addition, owing to the
   customizable shapes and sizes, the honeycomb-shaped stretchable
   aluminum-air batteries facilitate the integrated application of flexible
   batteries in wearables.}},

Abstract = {{Use of porous materials in fluid film is well established so as to make
   more uniform distribution of pressure along the journal surface. The
   work presented in this paper deals with theoretical examination into the
   effect of worn bearing surface on the behaviour of a hybrid double layer
   porous journal bearing system (DLPJBS) operating with power-law
   lubricants. The governing equation for the flow of non-Newtonian
   lubricant in the bearing porous clearance space is solved by using the
   FEM. The effects of nonNewtonian lubricant on the bearing
   characteristics of a worn bearing have been studied. Findings of this
   study indicates that the hybrid DLPJBS operating under non-Newtonian
   lubricant offers enhanced values of (h) over bar (min), (omega) over bar
   xth and rotor dynamic coefficients (stiffness and damping coefficients).}},

   exchange (IX) regenerant still bottom (SB) solutions. In the SBs,
   numerous PFAS were detected with a wide concentration range (similar to
   0.01 to 100 mg/L; total oxidizable precursors (TOP) similar to 4000 to
   10000 mg/L). In the ``high-concentration{''} plasma reactor, the
   concentrations of PFAS precursors and long-chain perfluoroalkyl acids
   (PFAAs) (>= 6C for PFSAs and >= 8C for perfluorocarboxylic acids
   (PFCAs)) were decreased by >99.9\% in 2 h, and short-chain PFAAs (<6C
   for perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFSAs) and <8C PFCAs) were decreased by
   >99\% in 6 h of treatment. Subsequently, a ``low concentration{''}
   plasma reactor was used to remove additional PFAAs. In this reactor, the
   addition of CTAB (cetrimonium bromide, a cationic surfactant) caused
   short-chain PFAAs, other than PFBA, to be removed to below detection
   limits in 90 min of treatment time. Overall, >99\% of the TOP present in
   SBs was removed during the treatment. Fluorine recovery of 47 to 117\%
   was obtained in six SB samples. Energy requirement (EE/O) for the
   treatment of PFOA and PFOS from SBs ranged from 380 to 830 kWh/m(3).}},

Abstract = {{Single-crystalline \{100\} faceted TiC is of great significance in

   to directly produce Ti and C atoms to synthesize single-crystalline
   \{100\} faceted TiC powders. Outstanding electrochemical performance of
   TiC \{100\} crystal planes in terms of the hydrogen evolution reaction
   is evidenced by an overpotential of 392 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), which is
   52\% lower than that of randomly faceted TiC counterparts (815 mV).}},

Title = {{Distribution of methanol and cyclopropenylidene around starless cores}},
Journal = {{ASTRONOMY \& ASTROPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{643}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{Context. The spatial distribution of molecules around starless cores is
   a powerful tool for studying the physics and chemistry governing the
   earliest stages of star formation.Aims. Our aim is to study the chemical
   differentiation in starless cores to determine the influence of
   large-scale effects on the spatial distribution of molecules within the
   cores. Furthermore, we want to put observational constraints on the
   mechanisms responsible in starless cores for the desorption of methanol
   from the surface of dust grains where it is efficiently
   produced.Methods. We mapped methanol, CH3OH, and cyclopropenylidene,
   c-C3H2, with the IRAM 30 m telescope in the 3 mm band towards six
   starless cores embedded in different environments, and in different
   evolutionary stages. Furthermore, we searched for correlations among
   physical properties of the cores and the methanol distribution.Results.
   From our maps we can infer that the chemical segregation between CH3OH
   and c-C3H2 is driven by uneven illumination from the interstellar
   radiation field (ISRF). The side of the core that is more illuminated
   has more C atoms in the gas-phase and the formation of carbon-chain
   molecules like c-C3H2 is enhanced. Instead, on the side that is less
   exposed to the ISRF the C atoms are mostly locked in carbon monoxide,
   CO, the precursor of methanol.Conclusions. We conclude that large-scale
   effects have a direct impact on the chemical segregation that we can
   observe at core scale. However, the non-thermal mechanisms responsible
   for the desorption of methanol in starless cores do not show any
   dependency on the H-2 column density at the methanol peak.}},

Title = {{Dissecting the eQTL Micro-Architecture in Caenorhabditis elegans}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN GENETICS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{The study of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) using natural
   variation in inbred populations has yielded detailed information about
   the transcriptional regulation of complex traits. Studies on eQTL using
   recombinant inbred lines (RILs) led to insights on cis and trans
   regulatory loci of transcript abundance. However, determining the
   underlying causal polymorphic genes or variants is difficult, but
   ultimately essential for the understanding of regulatory networks of
   complex traits. This requires insight into whether associated loci are
   single eQTL or a combination of closely linked eQTL, and how this QTL
   micro-architecture depends on the environment. We addressed these
   questions by testing for independent replication of previously mapped
   eQTL in Caenorhabditis elegans using new data from introgression lines
   (ILs). Both populations indicate that the overall heritability of gene
   expression, number, and position of eQTL differed among environments.
   Across environments we were able to replicate 70\% of the cis- and 40\%
   of the trans-eQTL using the ILs. Testing eight different simulation
   models, we suggest that additive effects explain up to 60-93\% of RIL/IL
   heritability for all three environments. Closely linked eQTL explained
   up to 40\% of RIL/IL heritability in the control environment whereas
   only 7\% in the heat-stress and recovery environments. In conclusion, we
   show that reproducibility of eQTL was higher for cis vs. trans eQTL and
   that the environment affects the eQTL micro-architecture.}},

   isolated cancer, antral isolated intestinal metaplastic tissue, antral
   isolated non-metaplastic gland and isolated non-metaplastic gland
   derived from the greater curvature of the most distant gastric body
   without mucosal atrophy. We examined AI and microsatellite instability
   statuses using PCR-based microsatellite analysis. Next, the DNA
   methylation status (high methylation epigenome {[}HME], intermediate
   methylation epigenome {[}IME], and low methylation epigenome {[}LME])
   was investigated. DNA methylation analysis of CDKN2A, mir34-b/c and MLHI
   genes was also performed. Results Although antral isolated IM glands
   were characterized by IME, isolated non-IM glands showed LME. In
   isolated cancer glands, HME was frequently found, compared with isolated
   non-IM glands. DNA methylation of mir34-b/c was common in isolated
   cancer and IM glands, whereas DNA methylation of CDKN2A was a rare event
   in isolated samples. The MLH1 gene was not methylated in isolated non-IM
   glands. Although multiple AIs were frequently found in isolated cancer
   glands, a few AIs were detected in isolated IM glands. Conclusions We
   suggest that the DNA methylation status and the status of the mir34-b/c
   gene among isolated samples of IMs and isolated non-IM glands have an
   impact on IM development.}},

Abstract = {{LT and HSCT are now potentially curative treatments for many medical
   conditions. Dermatologic manifestations are one of the sequelae after
   transplantation. To study the prevalence and associated risk factors of
   dermatologic manifestations after pediatric LT and HSCT. A 20-year
   retrospective cohort study was conducted in children, aged <= 15 years,
   who received LT or HSCT from January 1, 1997, to December 31, 2017.
   Medical records were reviewed for data collection until December 31,
   2018. A total of 70 LT and 51 HSCT recipients were included. The
   percentages of overall dermatologic manifestations after LT and HSCT
   were 64.3\% and 64.7\%, respectively. Viral infection was the most
   common manifestation in both groups, with mucocutaneous HSV infection as
   the most prevalent. One HSCT recipient developed leukemia cutis. GVHD
   was revealed in 27.5\% of HSCT recipients. Impetigo and xerosis were
   significantly observed in patients using azathioprine and prednisolone.
   Approximately two-thirds of pediatric LT and HSCT recipients experienced
   dermatologic manifestations, potentially associated with
   immunosuppressive agents. Thus, regular skin examination and optimized
   immunosuppression would be beneficial in these recipients.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Fetuin-A is a serum glycoprotein synthesized and secreted into blood by
   the liver and whose main physiological function is the inhibition of
   ectopic calcification. However, a number of studies have demonstrated
   that it is a multifunctional protein. For example, endocytic uptake of
   fetuin-A by tumor cells resulting in rapid cellular adhesion and
   spreading has been reported. The precise uptake mechanism, however, has
   been elusive. The present studies were done to determine whether
   Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4), which has been previously shown to be a
   receptor for fetuin-A and is commonly expressed in immune cells, could
   take part in the rapid uptake (< 3 min) of fetuin-A by tumor cells.
   Rapid uptake of fetuin-A was inhibited by the specific TLR4 inhibitor
   CLI-095 and also attenuated in TLR4 knockdown prostate tumor cells.
   Inhibition of TLR4 by CLI-095 also attenuated the rapid adhesion of
   tumor cells as well as invasion through a bed of Matrigel. The data
   suggest mechanisms by which TLR4 modulates the adhesion and growth of
   tumor cells.}},

Abstract = {{Single-molecule Forster Resonance energy transfer (smFRET) is an
   adaptable method for studying the structure and dynamics of
   biomolecules. The development of high throughput methodologies and the
   growth of commercial instrumentation have outpaced the development of

   the wealth of produced data. Here we present DeepFRET, an automated,
   open-source standalone solution based on deep learning, where the only
   crucial human intervention in transiting from raw microscope images to
   histograms of biomolecule behavior, is a user-adjustable quality
   threshold. Integrating standard features of smFRET analysis, DeepFRET
   consequently outputs the common kinetic information metrics. Its
   classification accuracy on ground truth data reached >95\% outperforming
   human operators and commonly used threshold, only requiring similar to
   1\% of the time. Its precise and rapid operation on real data
   demonstrates DeepFRET's capacity to objectively quantify biomolecular
   dynamics and the potential to contribute to benchmarking smFRET for
   dynamic structural biology.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To evaluate the association between prenatally detected
   isolated ventricular septum defects (VSDs) and chromosomal aberrations
   in a nationwide study in Denmark.
   Method Nationwide, register-based study with prospectively collected
   data including all singleton pregnancies from 2014-2018. From the Danish
   Fetal Medicine Database, we retrieved data on maternal characteristics,
   first-trimester biomarkers, pre- and postnatal diagnoses, genetic test
   results, and pregnancy outcomes. VSDs were considered isolated in the
   absence of other malformations or soft markers, and with a low
   first-trimester risk assessment for trisomies 21, 18 and 13. All cases
   of an isolated VSD with a chromosomal anomaly were audited. The genetic
   tests included karyotyping and chromosomal microarray.
   Results We retrieved data on 292 108 singleton pregnancies; 323
   registered with a prenatally detected VSD and 697 with a VSD detected
   postnatally (incidence of 0.35\%). Only 1/153 (0.7\%, 95\% CI
   0.02;3.6\%) of the isolated prenatally detected VSDs had an abnormal
   genetic test result (del (8)(q23.1)). Moreover, they had a lower free
   beta-hCG MoM (0.9 MoM vs 0.99 MoM, P = 0.02), and were more likely born
   small for gestational age (SGA), defined as birthweight 2 or more SD
   below the mean, compared with the control population (5.2\% vs 2.5\%, P
   = 0.03).
   Conclusion We found a prevalence of chromosomal aberrations of 0.7\% in
   fetuses with a prenatally detected isolated VSD. Moreover, we found an
   association between isolated VSDs and a larger proportion being born
   SGA.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a negatively charged poly (3-sulfopropyl inethacrylate
   potassium) (PSPMA) brush has been employed as a model system to
   demonstrate the tuning of the light response of strong polyelectrolyte
   brushes (SPBs) with counterions. The substitution of counterions by
   azobenzene-containing counterions (Azo-N+) renders the PSPMA brush
   light-responsive in aqueous solutions. Nevertheless, the strength of the
   light response of the PSPMA brush is weak due to the inefficient
   disassembly of the micelle-like aggregates in the brush upon irradiation
   with ultraviolet light. Counterion mixtures of Azo-N+ and r are employed
   to realize a strong light response of the PSPMA brush by incorporating a
   reasonable amount of Azo-N+ counterions into the brush. The strength of
   the light response of the PSPMA brush can be tuned by the mole ratio of
   Azo-N+ to K. Furthermore, properties including the hydration and
   conformation of the PSPMA brush can be reversibly switched via
   alternating ultraviolet and visible light irradiation. This work opens
   up the opportunities available for the use of counterions to tune the
   light response of SPBs.}},

Title = {{Efficacy of Tong-Xie-Yao-Fang granule and its impact on whole

Abstract = {{Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one kind of common
   functional bowel disease with obscure pathogenesis, and exploration
   about whole transcriptome profiling in IBS-D is still negligible.
   Conventional medications have limited effects, which makes focus shifted
   to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Tong-Xie-Yao-Fang, as a classic
   herbal formula in TCM, is pretty effective and safe for the treatment of
   diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D), but the
   underlying therapeutic mechanism remains unknown. We aim to verify the
   efficacy and safety of TXYF granule (the formula particles mixed
   together) in IBS-D and elucidate the gene-level mechanism of IBS-D and
   therapeutic targets of TXYF granule based on whole transcriptome
   analysis.
   Methods/design: This is a randomized, double-blind, and
   placebo-controlled clinical trial consisting of 2 weeks of run-in
   period, 12 weeks of treatment period, and 8 weeks of follow-up period.
   We will enroll 120 participants with IBS-D, who will be randomly
   assigned to the TXYF granule group and the placebo group, and recruit
   additional 10 healthy individuals as controls for mechanistic outcome.
   The two groups respectively take TXYF granule or placebo orally for
   treatment. The primary outcome is the response rate of IBS-Symptom
   Severity Score (IBS-SSS). The secondary outcomes include adequate relief
   (AR), IBS-Quality of Life Questionnaire (IBS-QOL), and long-term
   efficacy. Mechanistic outcome is the whole transcriptome profiling of
   the intestinal mucosae from IBS participants before and after the
   treatment and healthy individuals.
   Discussion: This trial will prove the effectiveness and safety of TXYF
   granule with high-quality evidence and provide a penetrating and
   comprehensive perspective on the molecular mechanism of IBS-D by whole
   transcriptome analysis, which makes us pinpoint specific biomarkers of
   IBS-D and therapeutic targets of TXYF.}},

Abstract = {{Potential degradation pathways of dimethylmercury (DMHg) remain as one
   of the critical knowledge gaps in the marine biogeochemical cycle of
   mercury (Hg). Although Hg is known to be highly reactive with reduced
   sulfur, demethylation of DMHg in the presence of sulfide has until now
   remained experimentally untested. Here, we provide the first
   experimental support for demethylation of DMHg to monomethylmercury
   (MMHg) in the presence of both dissolved sulfide and mackinawite
   (FeS(s)(m)). The degradation of DMHg was shown to be pH dependent, with
   higher demethylation rates at pH 9 than pH 5. At room temperature and
   environmentally relevant DMHg to sulfide molar ratios, we observed
   demethylation rates up to 0.05 d(-1). When comparing the number of
   active sites available, FeS(s)(m) was found to have a higher capacity to
   demethylate DMHg, in comparison with dissolved sulfide. Our study
   suggests that dissolved sulfide and FeS(s)(m) mediated demethylation of
   DMHg may act as a sink for DMHg, and a potential source of MMHg, in
   aquatic systems.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF NUCLEAR INSTALLATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{The accurate prediction of the neutronic and thermal-hydraulic coupling
   system transient behavior is important in nuclear reactor safety
   analysis, where a large-scale nonlinear coupling system with strong
   stiffness should be solved efficiently. In order to reduce the stiffness
   and huge computational cost in the coupling system, the high-performance
   numerical techniques for solving delayed neutron precursor equation are
   a key issue. In this work, a new precursor integral method with an
   exponential approximation is proposed and compared with widely used
   Taylor approximation-based precursor integral methods. The truncation
   errors of exponential approximation and Taylor approximation are
   analyzed and compared. Moreover, a time control technique is put forward
   which is based on flux exponential approximation. The procedure is
   tested in a 2D neutron kinetic benchmark and a simplified
   high-temperature gas-cooled reactor-pebble bed module (HTR-PM)
   multiphysics problem utilizing the efficient Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov
   method. Results show that selecting appropriate flux approximation in
   the precursor integral method can improve the efficiency and precision
   compared with the traditional method. The computation time is reduced to
   one-ninth in the HTR-PM model under the same accuracy when applying the
   exponential integral method with the time adaptive technique.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading
   worldwide. Lianhua Qingwen capsule (LQC) has shown therapeutic effects
   in patients with COVID-19. This study is aimed to discover its molecular
   mechanism and provide potential drug targets.
   Materials and Methods An LQC target and COVID-19-related gene set was
   established using the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology
   database and seven disease-gene databases. Gene ontology (GO), Kyoto
   Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis and
   protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were performed to discover the
   potential mechanism. Molecular docking was performed to visualize the
   patterns of interactions between the effective molecule and targeted
   protein.
   Results A gene set of 65 genes was generated. We then constructed a
   compound-target network that contained 234 nodes of active compounds and
   916 edges of compound-target pairs. The GO and KEGG indicated that LQC
   can act by regulating immune response, apoptosis and virus infection.
   PPI network and subnetworks identified nine hub genes. The molecular
   docking was conducted on the most significant gene Akt1, which is
   involved in lung injury, lung fibrogenesis and virus infection. Six
   active compounds of LQC can enter the active pocket of Akt1, namely
   beta-carotene, kaempferol, luteolin, naringenin, quercetin and wogonin,
   thereby exerting potential therapeutic effects in COVID-19.
   Conclusions The network pharmacological strategy integrates molecular
   docking to unravel the molecular mechanism of LQC. Akt1 is a promising
   drug target to reduce tissue damage and help eliminate virus infection.}},

Title = {{Is fall self-efficacy an independent predictor of recurrent fall events
   in older adults? Evidence from a 1-year prospective study}},
Journal = {{RESEARCH IN NURSING \& HEALTH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Falls, which are prevalent among older adults, may not only cause severe
   physical injuries, but also lead to low fall self-efficacy (FSE). Low
   FSE is associated with restricted activity, which putatively increases
   risk of future falls. However, emerging studies have failed to confirm
   this association. Furthermore, the interplay between age, gender, and
   fall history with falls has not been adequately addressed in adults aged
   70 years or older. The aims of this secondary analysis were to: (1)
   prospectively explore the association of FSE and fall events considering
   age, gender, and fall history, and (2) examine the characteristics of
   fall events and fall-related outcomes. Forty-seven community-dwelling
   adults over 70 years of age were followed for about 12 months. During
   the follow-up, 22 participants with low FSE experienced 119 fall events
   whereas 25 participants with high FSE reported 106 fall events. Among
   fallers, 72.3\% (n = 34) experienced recurrent fall events. About 15.0\%
   (n = 34) of 225 fall events resulted in injuries and 4.0\% of injuries
   required medical care. FSE was a statistically significant predictor of
   future fall events (incident rate ratio = 0.96, p = .013) regardless of
   age, gender, and fall history. Participants with low FSE were more
   likely than those with high FSE to fall more frequently without
   noticeable prodromal symptoms and apparent reasons. These findings
   suggest that FSE is an important protective factor against future fall
   events. However, interpretation of these results requires caution given
   the small sample size and effect size.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper I clarify a major affinity between Nietzsche and Spinoza
   that has been neglected in the literature-but that Nietzsche was aware
   of-namely a tendency to etiology. Etiologies provide follow-up,
   second-order explanations of first-order matters that have already
   otherwise been decided. The example I take up here is Nietzsche's and
   Spinoza's rejections of free will-and especially their etiologies
   concerning how we wrongly come to think that we may boast of such a
   capacity. In working through the former (i.e., their rejections of free
   will) in order to make my central metaphilosophical point regarding the
   latter (i.e., their accounts of why we generally affirm that we have
   free will), I shed important new light on Nietzsche's relation to
   Spinoza. I also further our understanding of what role such second-order
   accounts play within each of their larger projects on their own terms.}},

Title = {{Study on dehydrogenation behaviour of molten steel in single snorkel

Journal = {{IRONMAKING \& STEELMAKING}},
Abstract = {{A mathematical model of an industrial Single Snorkel Refining Furnace
   (SSRF) has been developed to investigate dehydrogenation behaviour in
   the vacuum refining process. Dehydrogenation reactions were considered
   to take place at three sites: Ar bubble surface, bath surface, and the
   bulk steel. The effects of Ar bubble behaviour and H2 heterogeneous
   nucleation behaviour of the bulk steel on dehydrogenation were taken
   into account specifically. The simulation results are in good agreement
   with the measured industrial data. Using the model, the dehydrogenation
   rate at different sites and its contribution to total dehydrogenation
   value were evaluated in detail. The results indicated that bulk steel
   dehydrogenation occurred only the high concentration range, while the
   other two reactions participated in the whole refining process. In
   addition, the effect of argon flow rate on the dehydrogenation rate was
   also obtained and the reasonable range of argon flow rate for SSRF
   treatment has been recommended.}},

Abstract = {{A novel composite adsorbent with high adsorption capacity, stable cycle
   performance and structure is developed. LiCl/zeolite 13X composite
   adsorbents with different LiCl content were synthesized by double
   solvents impregnation with alcohol and ethanol. The textural properties
   of composite adsorbents were characterized by nitrogen adsorption and
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The water adsorption performance of
   the composite adsorbents was tested, and the dynamic and equilibrium
   adsorption characteristics of the composite adsorbents were simulated by
   Polanyi potential theory and LDF model, respectively. Research on
   nitrogen adsorption suggested that because of the impregnated salt,
   composite adsorbents presented different pore structure pure. As the
   salt concentration of the LiCl solution increases, more salt is immersed
   into the pore channels of zeolite 13X, resulting in the LiCl content in
   the adsorbents increasing simultaneously. Water adsorption capacity of
   the composite adsorbent is not enhanced consistently with the increase
   in LiCl loading amount. After LiCl modification process, the water
   adsorption capacity increases little when the salt load is low, and
   then, the water adsorption capacity increases significantly with the
   increase in the salt load and finally decreases slightly. The sorption
   performance of CS30 with salt content of 16.7 wt\% was optimal, and the
   maximum sorption capacity was 0.7 g/g, nearly 3.3 times than properties
   of zeolite 13X 0.21 g/g. As the number of cycles increases, the
   adsorption capacity of the composite adsorbent decreases slightly. The
   tenth cycle is only reduced by 8.67\% compared to the first cycle.}},

Abstract = {{The reclamation of land and recovery of water from tailing ponds created
   during bitumen extraction from oil sands is a major technical and

   hydroxybutylated (HB) corn starch (HB-CS) and potato starch (HB-PS),
   with lower critical solution temperatures (LCSTs) ranging from 36 to 45
   degrees C, were examined as flocculants for oil sands mature fine
   tailings (MFT). The ability of different doses of the HB-CS and HB-PS to
   flocculate 2 and 10 wt \% MFT, prepared by diluting 35 wt \% MFT in tap
   water, in terms of the initial settling rate (ISR), supernatant
   turbidity (ST), sediment solids content (SSC), and water recovery (WR),
   was examined at temperatures below and above their LCSTs. The
   thermoresponsive HB-CS and HB-PS were good flocculants of MFT, and their
   thermoresponsive behavior was essential for optimal results in that they
   were considerably more effective in several aspects at temperatures
   above their LCSTs than below. In terms of ISRs, the HB-PS was a
   considerably better flocculant than the HB-CS, and this was especially
   so with the 10 wt \% MFT. With the HB-PS, the ISR was lower when using
   diluted MFT prepared with tap water as opposed to simulated oil sands
   process water.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Development of biofluid-based biomarkers is attractive for the
   diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but still
   lacking. Thus, here we aimed to identify serum metabolic biomarkers for
   the diagnosis of COPD.
   Methods In this study, we investigated serum metabolic features between
   COPD patients (n = 54) and normal individuals (n = 74) using a H-1
   NMR-based metabolomics approach and developed an integrated method of
   least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) and serum metabolic
   biomarkers to assist COPD diagnosis.
   Results We observed a hypometabolic state in serum of COPD patients, as
   indicated by decreases in N-acetyl-glycoprotein (NAG), lipoprotein (LOP,
   mainly LDL/VLDL), polyunsaturated fatty acid (pUFA), glucose, alanine,
   leucine, histidine, valine, and lactate. Using an integrated method of
   multivariable and univariate analyses, NAG and LOP were identified as
   two important metabolites for distinguishing between COPD patients and
   controls. Subsequently, we developed a LS-SVM classifier using these two
   markers and found that LS-SVM classifiers with linear and polynomial
   kernels performed better than the classifier with RBF kernel. Linear and
   polynomial LS-SVM classifiers can achieve the total accuracy rates of
   80.77\% and 84.62\% and the AUC values of 0.87 and 0.90 for COPD
   diagnosis, respectively.
   Conclusions This study suggests that artificial intelligence integrated
   with serum metabolic biomarkers has a great potential for auxiliary
   diagnosis of COPD.}},

Abstract = {{Background Small-sized primary tumor does not always indicate a better
   prognosis. We hypothesized that very small primary breast tumors with
   extensive lymph node (LN) metastases represented an aggressive biologic
   behavior in stage IV disease.
   Materials and Methods Data between 2010 and 2015 were retrieved
   retrospectively from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
   database with inclusion criteria of female sex, unilateral, metastatic,
   and T1/2 invasive ductal carcinoma. Primary study variables included T
   stage, N stage, grade, metastatic sites, number of involved sites,
   estrogen receptor status, progesterone receptor status, and human
   epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status. Kaplan-Meier and adjusted Cox
   proportional hazards models with interaction terms were used. One-, 2-
   and 3-year breast cancer-specific mortality (BCSM) was examined
   according to tumor size.
   Results We identified 5,340 eligible patients with breast cancer. In
   multivariate analysis, race, age, grade, molecular subtype, surgery,
   brain metastases, and liver metastases were found to be independently
   associated with BCSM. For T1 tumors, the N0, N1, and N2+ groups had the
   same BCSM. In tumors smaller than 50 mm, the 1-, 2-, and 3-year BCSM did
   not decline with the decrease of tumor size. For triple-negative breast
   cancers (TNBCs), the T1a/T1bN2+ group had significantly worse BCSM than
   any other group did.
   Conclusion Patients with stage IV cancer with small-sized tumors may
   have BCSM as high as those with larger tumors. In TNBCs, very small
   tumors with severe LN involvement are associated with the worst BCSM.
   Continued efforts are needed to further investigate Ta1/T1bN2 + M1 TNBCs
   and individualize the treatment for affected patients.
   Implications for Practice This study revealed that for stage IV breast
   cancer, smaller primary tumors were not always associated with better
   breast cancer-specific mortality. This study illustrated that very small
   triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) with extensive regional lymph
   node involvement may be a surrogate for biologically aggressive disease.
   Because of poor prognosis of T1a/T1bN2+ TNBCs, there might be an urgent
   need of more individualized treatment for affected patients. Future
   correlative studies ought to focus on the genetic and molecular
   differences in Ta1/T1bN2+ TNBCs that contribute to the biological
   behavior. Clarification of the regulation mechanism of very small-sized
   primary TNBCs with metastatic outgrowth in nodes and distant sites will
   play an integral role in developing targeted therapies.}},

Title = {{Management of proximal penile prosthetic cylindrical complications: a
   novel direct crural approach}},
Journal = {{BASIC AND CLINICAL ANDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 3}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Patients with proximal penile prosthetic cylindrical
   complications (PPPCC) can be treated with a direct crural technique
   without using the original traditional approach. In this article we
   present our novel direct crural approach for management of patients with
   PPPCC.
   Materials and methods: Between 2014 and 2019, data were retrospectively
   collected from 13 patients who underwent surgical revision using our
   novel direct crural approach for PPPCC. The procedure commences with
   identification of the affected zone. The patient is in a low lithotomy
   position. A 2-centimeter longitudinal incision is made directly over the
   affected site. Dissection is carried down through Colles' fascia,
   followed by a longitudinal incision through the tunica albuginea at the
   proximal part of the affected cylinder. Via the incision we can deliver
   out the cylinder and manage its problem.
   Results: Mean operative time was 40 min. No intra or post-operative
   complications were reported. All patients (Mean age = 57) were
   discharged on the same day. Postoperative follow-up found correction of
   all existing deformities at month 1, 3 and 6. All patients were
   satisfied and reported less pain and faster recovery than the first
   procedure.
   Conclusion: Our technique, which can be used for all types of penile
   prosthesis, is both feasible and safe. It may simplify PPPCC revision by
   avoiding adhesions below the original incision, without jeopardizing the
   already implanted materials or the urethra. It may also improve
   patients' safety and satisfaction, by reducing iatrogenic injury and
   post-operative recovery time.}},

Abstract = {{As an ancient clonal root and leaf crop, taro (Colocasia esculenta,
   Araceae) is highly polymorphic with uncertain genetic and geographic
   origins. We explored chloroplast DNA diversity in cultivated and wild
   taros, and closely related wild taxa, and found cultivated taro to be
   polyphyletic, with tropical and temperate clades that appear to
   originate in Southeast Asia sensu lato. A third clade was found
   exclusively in wild populations from Southeast Asia to Australia and
   Papua New Guinea. Our findings do not support the hypothesis of taro
   domestication in Papua New Guinea, despite archaeological evidence for
   early use or cultivation there, and the presence of apparently natural
   wild populations in the region (Australia and Papua New Guinea).}},

   Inhibition Test and Its Correction for Predicting Soil Toxicity from

Abstract = {{In this study, light intensities of Aliivibrio fischeri obtained from
   soil suspension and its filtrate were compared using field soils
   contaminated with heavy metals. The soils collected from rice paddy and
   forest had different soil textures with either high or low silt/clay
   content. The correlation between soil toxicity and soil solution
   toxicity for A. fischeri showed a high linearity in sandy soils with the
   slope of 0.586 (determination coefficient; R-2 = 0.709). Meanwhile, a
   lower correlation in silty/clay soils with the slope of 0.154 (R-2 =
   0.067) was observed. When a solid phase bioluminescence inhibition test
   is carried out using soil suspension with a high silt/clay content, a
   large amount of A. fischeri seems to adhere to microparticles and/or
   microaggregates. It may result in the change of light intensity (i.e.,
   distorted toxicity test result) that could not be corrected by the
   modified basic solid phase test protocol, and thus the toxicity is
   likely to be overestimated. Such alteration in the light intensity could
   be partially overcome using a regression equation accounting for
   microbial loss by adhesion. With the correction for microbial adhesion,
   the correlation between soil toxicity and soil solution toxicity in the
   selected soil samples with high silt/clay contents increased from 0.182
   (R-2 = 0.130) to 0.571 (R-2 = 0.602). It is expected that soil toxicity
   can be evaluated through the prediction of soil solution toxicity after
   the proper correction of microparticles effects.}},

Abstract = {{Positioned at the crossroads of the market, public policies and civil

   social goals and, in an entrepreneurial way, respond to collective

   business models, the aim of this paper is to understand the
   contribution, and the approach adopted by work integration social
   enterprises to the creation of public value. Our findings suggest that
   the approach adopted in order to generate value, changes according to
   several contextual factors. We identified, in particular, three models
   (the cooperative-driven, the people-driven, and the market-driven model)
   that are characterized by different relationship with the cooperative
   system, a differentiated tension toward commercial activities and
   specific catalysts for value creation.}},

   FL 478 possessing the Saltol QTL for seedling stage salinity tolerance.
   The confirmation for the presence of Saltol QTL in the lines was
   analyzed using the foreground SSR marker RM 3412, a linked marker for
   Saltol QTL. The lines along with the recurrent parents ADT 37 and CR
   1009 Sub 1 and donor parent FL 478 were subjected to salt stress under
   hydroponic condition under two different concentrations of EC viz., 6
   dS/m (lower concentration) and 12 dS/m (higher concentration). The salt
   stress injury scoring, root and shoot length reduction percentage and
   Na+/K+ ratio were analyzed and measured. Among the lines, BIL 752, BIL
   1094 and BIL 1102 showed tolerance to salt stress injury, minimum
   reduction in root (18.1\%) and shoot length (27.4\%) percentage and the
   minimum Na+/K+ ratio in both shoots and roots even under higher
   concentration while BIL 33, BIL 44 and BIL 1095 showed moderate
   tolerance to salt stress. The selected saline tolerant lines will be
   further evaluated in saline areas to observe yield potentiality for
   developing high yielding saline tolerant varieties and as donor parents

Abstract = {{Objectives/Hypothesis Mal de debarquement syndrome (MDDS) is
   characterized by a persistent rocking sensation, as though on a boat. It
   may occur following exposure to passive motion (motion-triggered MDDS
   {[}MT-MDDS]), or spontaneously (spontaneous-onset MDDS {[}SO-MDDS]).
   This study investigated the characteristics of MDDS patients with
   vestibular migraine (MDDS-VM) to those without (MDDS-O).
   Study Design Retrospective review.
   Methods Retrospective, single-center study of 62 patients with MDDS.
   Clinical characteristics, Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), Migraine
   Disability Assessment Score (MIDAS), job impact, and optimal
   treatment(s) were studied.
   Results There were 23 MDDS-O (19 women), and 39 MDDS-VM (35 women)
   patients. Comparisons between MDDS-VM and MDDS-O showed significant
   differences in age of onset (41 vs. 52 years, P = .005), interictal
   visually induced dizziness (89.7\% vs. 30.4\%, P < .001), interictal
   head motion-induced dizziness (87.2\% vs. 47.8\%, P = .001), other
   vestibular sensations (59\% vs. 13\%, P < .001), interictal aural
   symptoms (25.6\% vs. 0\%, P = .008), number of interictal symptoms (4.3
   vs. 2.3, P < .001), total DHI score (54.9 vs. 38.1, P = .005), DHI-P
   (physical domain) score (16.1 vs. 10, P = .004), DHI-F (functional
   domain) score (20.9 vs. 15.7, P = .016 MIDAS (4.6 vs. 32, P = .002), and
   job resignations (23.2\% vs. 5\%, P = .016). On the other hand,
   between-group comparisons for MT-MDDS and SO-MDDS did not reveal any
   significant differences whatsoever. For optimal treatment, venlafaxine
   was the most used (27.3\%) in all groups. For MDDS-VM, antiepileptic
   drugs and migraine preventive vitamins were also useful in relieving
   symptoms.
   Conclusions MDDS-VM patients appear to be more disabled than MDDS-O, in
   terms of severity of dizziness, job impact, and number of symptoms, but
   have good potential for improvement, particularly with migraine
   prophylactic treatment.

Abstract = {{The gout disease is spreading worldwide and its drug target is the human
   xanthine oxidase. Through this work, we investigated the inhibitory
   effect of the ten lanthanide(III) complexes of biologically active
   bis-coumarins on xanthine oxidase. We achieved molecular docking studies
   using GOLD software to study the formed interactions in the
   enzyme-inhibitor complex. The results confirm the inhibitory effect of
   the lanthanide complexes showing the best Nd(III) complex with IC50 of
   12.91 nM. The docking results confirm this inhibition. We saved nearly
   the same interactions between the two inhibitors allopurinol and the
   Nd(III) complex according to the docking results. No further studies
   have been found in this context. The ADMET analysis show that the three
   complexes are nontoxic.

Abstract = {{Background Atrial fibrillation (AF) and peripheral artery disease (PAD)
   are common conditions that increase cardiovascular risk. We determined
   the association between PAD and prognosis in a cohort of real-world
   patients receiving oral anticoagulant therapy for nonvalvular AF.
   Methods We prospectively included 1956 patients (mean age 73.8 +/- 9.5
   years, 44.0\% women) receiving oral anticoagulant therapy for AF.
   Clinical characteristics were collected at baseline. Patients were
   followed for a period of 3 years. Survival analysis and multivariable
   regression analyses were performed to assess variables related to death,
   stroke, bleeding, myocardial infarction and major adverse cardiovascular
   events (MACE).
   Results Patients with PAD (n = 118; 6\%) exhibited higher rates of
   cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular diseases. After 3 years
   of follow-up, there were a total of 255 deaths (no PAD 233, vs PAD 22),
   45 strokes (43 vs 2), 146 major bleedings (136 vs 10) and 168 MACE (148
   vs 20). On univariate analysis, there was a higher risk of
   cardiovascular mortality (2.02\%/year no PAD vs 4.08\%/year PAD, P =
   .02), myocardial infarction (0.99\%/year no PAD vs 2.43\%/year PAD, P =
   .02) and MACE (3.18\%/year no PAD vs 6.99\%/year PAD, P < .01). There
   was no statistically significant association with these events after
   multivariable adjustment.
   Conclusions In a large cohort of anticoagulated patients with AF, the
   presence of PAD represents a higher risk subgroup and is associated with
   worse crude outcomes. The exact contribution of the PAD independently of
   other cardiovascular diseases or risk factors requires further
   investigation.}},

   showed greater roughness. Crosslinking increased the swelling capacity
   of the mixed hydrogel at pH 7, although it remained decreased concerning
   the S/T hydrogel. However, this property was sensitive to pH variations.
   The mixed film (S/T/C) showed greater mechanical resistance. The casting

Title = {{The impact of firm size on competitive intelligence activities}},
Journal = {{FORESIGHT}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{5-6, SI}},
Pages = {{563-577}},
Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   Given the importance of competitive intelligence (CI) to the economic
   performance of firms, understanding whether CI practice is impacted by
   firm size or by their awareness of CI maybe important when creating
   programs designed to improve firms' CI performance. This paper aims to
   address this by examining the extent to which the CI practices of small
   and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and large firms differed using a
   sample of firms with knowledge/awareness of CI.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A survey was developed that included 10 CI organization questions and 67
   CI process questions. The survey was sent to a sample with
   awareness/knowledge of CI - strategic and CI professionals (SCIP)
   members and individuals who had attended SCIP events T-tests were then
   used to compare the SME's and large firms' responses to the 10 CI
   organization and 67 CI process questions.
   Findings
   For firms with CI awareness/knowledge, the study results suggest that
   size has very little relationship with CI practice. Of the 10 CI
   organization variables, only two were significantly different between
   the SME's and the large firms. Large firms had more full-time CI staff
   and were more likely to have a formal intelligence unit compared to the
   SME's. Of the 67 CI process variables, only four were significantly
   different between the SME's and the large firms. Large firms made more
   use of company intranet for distributing CI findings use business
   analytics software and use commercial databases for information than
   SME's while the SME's used social media, in particular Facebook more
   than large firms, in their competitive intelligence activities.
   Originality/value
   This study uses a sample frame of firms with CI awareness/knowledge in
   examining differences between SME's and large firms CI practices.}},

Title = {{Photocatalytic hydrogen production using FeTiO3 concentrates modified by
   high energy ball milling and the presence of Mg precursors}},
Journal = {{TOPICS IN CATALYSIS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{1-2, SI}},
Pages = {{2-16}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Ilmenite (FeTiO3) concentrates were modified by high energy ball milling
   (HEBM) at different times (1, 2, and 3 h) and in the presence of MgO or
   metallic Mg at different contents (0.5, 1.0, and 3.0 wt\%), with the aim
   of obtaining a low-cost and highly available photocatalyst with enhanced
   performance towards H-2 production. FeTiO3 concentrates were obtained
   from ilmenite-rich black sand by gravimetric concentration followed by
   wet electromagnetic and dry magnetic separation. HEBM was performed to
   insert Mg into FeTiO3 structure and to simultaneously reduce the
   particle size. The insertion of Mg intended to shift the conduction band
   of the materials to more negative potentials, in spite of the band-gap
   widening. XRD patterns of the milled samples showed a decrease in the
   intensity of ilmenite peaks without any displacement, indicating slight
   amorphization without significant changes in the crystalline structure.
   However, the increase in the intensity of hematite peaks suggests
   substitutional doping according to the proposed solid-state reactions.
   Although thermodynamic analyses showed that doping with metallic Mg
   should be more favorable, doping with MgO appears to be kinetically
   favored due to the physical characteristics of the precursor, as it was
   revealed by XRD, XPS, Raman spectroscopy, SEM-EDS, and UV-Vis DRS
   results. Deconvolution of high-resolution XPS spectra corresponding to
   Mg1s exhibited the presence of an additional component peak for the
   sample milled with metallic Mg, in comparison to that with MgO. This
   result evidenced the formation of a new phase, suggesting that part of
   the metallic Mg was not inserted into FeTiO3, as it was confirmed by
   Raman spectroscopy. UV-Vis DRS analyses showed an increase in the
   band-gap of the samples milled in the presence of Mg precursors (from
   2.51 to 2.55-2.59 eV) which were attributed to slight modifications of
   the conduction band due to the insertion of Mg. The performance towards
   hydrogen production under UV irradiation was improved from 240.5 mu mol
   g(-1) h(-1) (unmilled sample) to 255.3 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) (2 h milled in
   the absence of Mg precursor), 296.0 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) (2 h milled with
   1.0 wt\% MgO), and 265.2 mu mol g(-1) h(-1) (2 h milled with 1.0 wt\%
   metallic Mg). This improvement was attributed mainly to the insertion of
   Mg, and the consequent modification of the band structure, rather than
   the modification in the surface area.}},

Abstract = {{Although mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in the
   pathophysiology of attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder ADHD,
   the role of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has not been extensively
   investigated. To determine whether mtDNA haplogroups influence risk of
   ADHD, we performed a case-control study comprising 2076 ADHD cases and
   5078 healthy controls, all of whom were European decedents recruited
   from The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). Associations
   between eight major European mtDNA Haplogroups and ADHD risk were
   assessed in three independent European cohorts. Meta-analysis of the
   three studies indicated that mtDNA haplogroups K (odds ratio=0.69,
   P=2.24x10(-4), P-corrected=1.79x10(-3)) and U (odds ratio=0.77,
   P=8.88x10(-4), P-corrected=7.11x10(-3)) were significantly associated
   with reduced risk of ADHD. In contrast, haplogroup HHV{*} (odds
   ratio=1.18, P=2.32x10(-3), P-corrected=0.019) was significantly
   associated with increased risk of ADHD. Our results provide novel
   insight into the genetic basis of ADHD, implicating mitochondrial
   mechanisms in the pathophysiology of this relatively common psychiatric

Abstract = {{Under emerging water scarcities in the face of global warming,
   optimization of irrigation and nutrient inputs is essential to maximize
   input-use efficiency. Thus, a field experiment was conducted with wheat
   for 2-years to evaluate the effects of N and deficit irrigations on
   yield formation, water productivity (WP) and nitrogen-uptake efficiency
   (NUE). Treatment consisted of combinations of four N application levels,
   i.e., 60, 90, 120 and 150 kg ha(-1) as main-plot factors and seven
   levels of irrigation water (IW; equaling 1.00, 0.85, 0.70, 0.55, 0.40,
   0.25 and 0.10 times of the cumulative open pan evaporation, CPE) as
   sub-plot factors. After pre-plant and first post-planting irrigation
   through flood method, line-source sprinklers were used. Grain yield
   increased with applied N and was the maximum (3.39-4.66 Mg ha(-1)) at
   IW:CPE 0.85 and declined @ 0.67-0.81 Mg ha(-1) for every 0.1 IW:CPE.
   Application of 150 kg N ha(-1) improved the grain yield by 6.0-8.9\%
   over 120 kg N ha(-1) under medium stress (IW:CPE 0.41-0.70) and no
   stress (> 0.70) conditions, but showed little impact under severe stress
   (0.10-0.40) conditions. Rather it declined by 45.3-66.1 and 13.0-26.1\%
   at 60 and 90 kg N ha(-1) over 120 kg N ha(-1), respectively under the
   latter. The WP and NUE ranged between 1.28-1.36 kg m(-3) and
   37.4-38.4\%, respectively, with 120-150 kg N ha(-1), while the counter
   figures were 0.99 kg m(-3) and 30.2\% with 60 kg N ha(-1). On the whole,
   results indicate basing N applications on the water availability for
   irrigation for optimal grain yields where, WP and NUE vis-a-vis benefits

Abstract = {{Objective To analyze the Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) and the
   Voice-Related Quality of Life (V-RQOL) scores based on the perceptual
   and analytical parameters in primary MTD patients with no reflux.
   Study Design Cross-sectional study.
   Methods One hundred and eighteen participants, that is, sixty patients
   with normal voices and fifty-eight patients with primary MTD were
   recruited in this study. The diagnosis of primary MTD was made by
   perceptual voice analysis, neck palpation, video-laryngoscopic
   examination, and exclusion of other etiologies. Acoustic analysis and
   the GRBAS (Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, and Strain) scale
   were evaluated for all participants. The V-RQOL and RSI questionnaires
   were then given to all participants.
   Results This study included 118 participants of 29 males (48.3\%) and 31
   females (51.7\%) in the normal group. MTD group also included 27 males
   (46.6\%) and 31 (53.4\%) female patients. Mean (SD) RSI and V-RQOL
   scores were 12.35 (3.84) and 11.09 (2.20) for the normal group, and
   22.87 (6.97) and 22.89 (7.94) for the MTD group (P = .000). In the MTD
   group, V-RQOL had a positive correlation with jitter for /i/ and /u/,
   Noise to Harmonic Ratio (NHR) for /i/, /a/, and /u/, and Grade,
   Roughness, and Strain of GRBAS scale (P < .05). In addition, RSI had a
   positive correlation with Strain in the MTD group (P < .05).
   Conclusion MTD patients in the absence of laryngopharyngeal reflux
   findings may have high RSI scores. Hence, patients with high RSI scores
   and disproportionate acoustic and perceptual analysis would require a
   thorough evaluation of MTD.

   Biopharmaceutical Drug Products: Incorporating Ester Distribution during

Abstract = {{Polysorbate 20 (PS20) is a commonly used surfactant in biopharmaceutical
   formulations. It is a heterogeneous surfactant containing a distribution
   of fatty acid esters, which are subject to hydrolytic degradation,
   generating free fatty acids (FFAs). The FFAs can form visible or
   subvisible particles in drug product on stability. A previous FFA
   solubility model, developed by our group, predicts solubility limits for
   the three most prevalent FFA degradation products of PS20: lauric,
   myristic, and palmitic acid. The model takes into account two
   formulation parameters, pH and PS20 concentration, and their effect on
   FFA solubility. This work identifies a third parameter that has an
   impact on FFA solubility: PS20 ester distribution. When PS20 is
   hydrolytically degraded, the ester distribution of the remaining
   surfactant changes on stability. Ester distribution is known to
   influence the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of PS20 such that the
   monoesters have a much higher CMC compared to the higher-order esters
   (HOE). We hypothesize that as PS20 degrades, the CMC changes, affecting
   the proportion of PS20 that is present in micelles and capable of
   sequestering and solubilizing FFAs in these micelles. Here, PS20 was
   separated into monoester, HOE, and polyol fractions. The monoester and
   HOE fractions were mixed together to generate the mock degradation
   profiles of hydrolytically degraded PS20. FFA solubility was measured as
   a function of the concentration of these mock-degraded (MD) PS20s. The
   results indicate that ester distribution does have an impact on FFA
   solubility, especially at higher MD PS20 concentrations. HOEs solubilize
   up to 30 mu g/mL more lauric acid than an equivalent amount of
   monoesters at a MD PS20 level of 0.06\% w/v. With the addition of \% HOE
   peak area fraction as a third parameter representing the ester
   distribution of PS20, the refined FFA solubility model more accurately
   predicts FFA solubility in protein formulations at 5 degrees C. The
   refined model suggests that drug products containing trace levels of
   host cell proteins (HCPs) that preferentially degrade HOEs of PS20 are
   at a higher risk of particle formation.}},

Abstract = {{Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress occurs when protein folding or
   maturation is disrupted. A malfunction in the ER stress response can
   lead to cell death and has been observed in many neurological diseases.
   However, how the ER stress response is regulated in neuronal cells
   remains largely unclear. Here, we studied an E3 ubiquitin ligase named
   neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated protein
   4-like (Nedd4-2). Nedd4-2 is highly expressed in the brain and has a
   high affinity toward ubiquitinating membrane-bound proteins. We first
   utilized unbiased proteomic profiling with ultra-performance liquid
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) of isolated
   membrane fractions from mouse whole brains to identify novel targets of
   Nedd4-2. Through this screen, we found that the expression and
   ubiquitination of ribosomal proteins are regulated by Nedd4-2 and we
   confirmed an association between Nedd4-2 and ribosomes through ribosome
   sedimentation and polysome profiling. Further, we utilized
   immunoprecipitation and western blotting to show that induction of ER
   stress promotes an association between Nedd4-2 and ribosomal proteins,
   which is mediated through dephosphorylation of Nedd4-2 at serine-342.
   This increased interaction between Nedd4-2 and ribosomal proteins in
   turn mediates ER stress-associated translational suppression. In
   summary, the results of this study demonstrate a novel regulatory
   mechanism underlying the ER stress response and a novel function of
   Nedd4-2 in translational control. Our findings may shed light on
   neurological diseases in which the ER stress response or the function of
   Nedd4-2 is dysregulated.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, pure and 0.04\%, 0.19\%, 0.4\%, 1.9\%, and 4\%
   LiNO3-doped PVAL (polyvinyl alcohol) electrolyte were fabricated in the
   form of solid films by the casting process. The influence of Li+-ions on
   PVAL was identified by some characterization tools such as X-ray
   diffraction, FT-IR (Fourier transform infrared), scanning electron
   microscope (SEM), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), UV-visible-NIR
   spectroscopy, dielectric, and conductivity measurements. X-ray
   diffraction studies indicate that the semicrystalline of PVAL and the
   calculated crystallize size from Gaussian fitting were decreased with
   Li+-ions concentration. FT-IR results indicate that there is strong
   interaction among doping ions and the matrix. The surface morphology of
   the electrolyte films was studied via SEM. The optical studies
   demonstrate that the transmittance of films decreased with the rising of
   Li+-ions. Urbach's energy and bandgap are also reduced with adding more
   ions. Different empirical equations were used to study the relation
   between the energy gap and the refractive index. The index of refraction
   of the films has average values in 2.024 to 2.078 range. Li+-ion
   concentrations critically influenced the factors of nonlinearity. The
   calculated values of nonlinear optical susceptibility chi((3)) and
   refractive index n(2) were increased from 8.6 x 10(-13) esu and 1.55 x
   10(-11) to 20.56 x 10(-10) esu and 2.05 x 10(-11), respectively. The
   dielectric constant and loss measurements of the PVAL embedded with 4\%
   of LiNO3 (SPL-5) were decreased exponentially with increasing the
   incident frequency. The AC electrical conductivity (sigma(AC)) and
   nonlinear I-V curves are enhanced by increasing the Li+-ion contents.
   The electrical current was increased with small resistivity for SPL-5
   film. The studied films have an inimitable result in various fields,
   such as nonlinear optical and varistor devices.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Clinical application of electrically-evoked intracochlear auditory
   brainstem responses (eABRs) for evaluation of brainstem maturity or
   aging changes has not been well investigated.
   Aim/objective
   We compare the eV latencies of intraoperative eABR measurements in
   one-year-olds, infants, children, adults, and the elderly, with the goal
   of investigating the changes in the brainstem auditory pathway due to
   development and aging.
   Materials and methods
   We studied 58 ears of 51 patients who underwent cochlear implantation
   between 2013 and 2019 using MED-EL's Concerto or Synchrony implants with
   Flex28 or Flex soft electrodes. EABRs were recorded during cochlear
   implantation. The stimuli were delivered by the MED-EL Maestro to the
   apical, middle, and basal turn electrodes at stimulus levels 1000, 800,
   and 600 cu, with a pulse width of 30 mu s.
   Results
   In eABRs recorded from electrodes installed at both the mastoid and
   nape, there was no difference in latency between age groups within each
   stimulus level.
   Conclusion and significance
   ABR latency was not affected by development after age one and aging of
   the brainstem auditory pathway. Our study will be useful as a control in
   identifying abnormal eABR wave configurations in patients with cochlear
   malformations, cochlear nerve deficiencies, or auditory neuropathy,
   regardless of age.}},

Abstract = {{UCBT recipients with TM are at high risk of EF related to low number of
   stem cells and prior alloimmunization after multiple blood transfusions.
   Here, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of double-unit UCBT using
   TT-containing conditioning regimens in TM. Retrospective analysis of
   children who underwent double-unit UCBT for TM in the Prince of Wales
   Hospital between August 2007 and January 2017, and outcome of
   double-unit UCBT for TM was compared with outcome of HLA-matched sibling
   BMT. Ten patients, median age 4.2 years, received double-unit UCBT. All
   patients except one engrafted at a median of 19 days. None of the
   patients with successful engraftment had grade III or IV aGVHD. Among
   nine patients with successful engraftment, six of nine patients
   evaluable after day 100 developed cGVHD. All patients with cGVHD were
   well controlled after treatment with steroids and/or supportive care and
   maintained good quality of life. In comparison with patients receiving
   BMT, those given UCBT had slower platelet recovery, and more cGVHD. With
   a median follow-up of 272 months after BMT and 84 months after UCBT, the
   8-year OS after BMT and UCBT was 92\% and 90\% (P = .84), whereas 8-year
   DFS after BMT and UCBT was 87\% and 80\% (P = .54). UCB could be an
   acceptable source of stem cells for transplantation of TM patients when
   HLA-matched family bone marrow donors are NA.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose This study aims to elicit the preferences of potential travelers
   for different property listings' attributes (online review number,
   positive valence rate of reviews and discount strategy) when selecting
   hotels and peer-to-peer (P2P) accommodation sharing on online booking
   platforms. Design/methodology/approach A discrete choice experiment
   (DCE) was conducted with 291 respondents with accommodation needs. They
   were asked to choose between pairs of listings. Findings The authors
   found that when booking accommodation online, complex discount
   strategies were not determinant both in selecting hotels and P2P
   accommodations. Positive valence rate of reviews has a higher impact on
   the selection of traditional hotels than P2P accommodations, while the
   number of online reviews has a higher impact on the selection of P2P
   accommodations than traditional hotels. The authors further discuss the
   effect of each attribute on online accommodation selection in terms of
   price ranges of the property listings. Research limitations/implications
   The findings provide suggestions for platform operators and
   product/service providers to improve their marketing strategies and
   optimize their management efforts. Originality/value To the best of the
   authors' knowledge, this is one of the first studies that investigate
   the role of property listings' attributes on the selections between
   hotels and P2P accommodations. The findings from this research study
   could be generalized to other online platforms and electronic

Abstract = {{Purpose This research proposes a multivariate control chart, whose
   parameters are optimized using genetic algorithms (GA) in order to
   accelerate the detection of a change in the vector of means.
   Design/methodology/approach This chart is based on a variation of the
   Hotelling T-2 chart using a sampling scheme called generalized multiple
   dependent state sampling. For the analysis of performances of this
   chart, the out-of-control average run length (ARL) values were used for
   different scenarios. In this comparison, it was considered the classic
   Hotelling T-2 chart and the T-2 chart using the scheme called multiple
   dependent state sampling. Findings It was observed that the new chart
   with its optimized parameters is more efficient to detect an
   out-of-control process. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was
   performed, and it was concluded that the best yields are obtained when
   the change to be considered in the optimization is small. An application
   in the resolution of a real problem is given. Originality/value In this
   research, a multivariate control chart is proposed based on the
   Hotelling T-2 statistic but adding a sampling scheme. This makes this
   control chart more efficient than the classic T-2 chart because the new
   chart not only uses the current information of the T-2 statistic but
   also conditions the decision to consider a process as ``in- control{''}
   on the statistic's previous information. The practitioner can obtain the
   optimal parameters of this new chart through a friendly program
   developed by the authors.}},

Abstract = {{The galanin receptor family of proteins is present throughout the
   central nervous system and endocrine system. It comprises of three
   subtypes-GalR1, GalR2, and GalR3; all of which are G-protein-coupled
   receptors. Galanin predominantly acts as an inhibitory, hyper-polarizing
   neuromodulator, which has several physiological as well as pathological
   functions. Galanin has a role in mediating food intake, memory, sexual
   behavior, nociception and is also associated with diseases such as
   Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, diabetes mellitus, and chronic pain.
   However, the understanding of signaling mechanisms of the galanin family
   of neuropeptides is limited and an organized pathway map is not yet
   available. Therefore, a detailed literature mining of the publicly
   available articles pertaining to the galanin receptor was followed by
   manual curation of the reactions and their integration into a map. This
   resulted in the cataloging of molecular reactions involving 64 molecules
   into five categories such as molecular association,
   activation/inhibition, catalysis, transport, and gene regulation. For
   enabling easy access of biomedical researchers, the galanin-galanin
   receptor signaling pathway data was uploaded to WikiPathways (), a
   freely available database of biological pathways.}},

Abstract = {{Objective This study aimed to explore the relationship of thyroid
   function and glucose metabolism and to investigate the changes in
   thyroid function after National Metabolic Management Center (MMC)
   management in type 2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM).
   Methods A total of 2000 euthyroid participants from MMC in Shanghai
   General Hospital and a community physical examination were recruited.
   They were categorized into four groups: normal glucose tolerance (NGT, n
   = 132), prediabetes (N = 147), DM well-controlled (T2DM with
   glycosylated hemoglobin {[}HbA1c] <= 7\%, n = 505), and DM uncontrolled
   (T2DM with HbA1c > 7\%, n = 1216). The parameters were compared among
   the groups and their changes before and after MMC follow-up in DM
   uncontrolled group were observed.
   Results Free triiodothyronine (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4) levels
   varied significantly among groups. FT3 and FT4 levels negatively
   correlated with HbA1c level (P < 0.05), and positively correlated with
   the estimated glucose disposal rate (eGDR) (P < 0.05). Following MMC
   management, blood glucose and insulin resistance in the DM uncontrolled
   group were dramatically improved (P < 0.001). Meanwhile, FT3 was
   elevated compared to the baseline (from 4.51 +/- 0.78 pmol/L to 4.68 +/-
   0.87 pmol/L, P < 0.05), and reverse triiodothyronine (r-T3) decreased
   from 1.03 +/- 0.24 nmol/L to 0.92 +/- 0.25 nmol/L (P < 0.001).
   Thyroid-stimulating hormone significantly decreased as well (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions Decreased free thyroid hormone levels in normal range were
   associated with high glucose and insulin resistance. After MMC
   management, improvement of blood glucose and insulin resistance were
   accompanied by the restoration of low-normal thyroid function.}},

Abstract = {{Male couples in open relationships tend to have as equally fulfilling
   relationships as monogamous male couples; however, less is known about
   communication differences between monogamous and open couples. Because
   couples with open agreements permit sex with outside partners, they must
   navigate different relationship issues than monogamous couples, and this
   can translate to differences in communication. We therefore examined
   differences between cisgender men in monogamous versus open
   relationships regarding communication about sexual agreements, safety
   agreements, breaking of sexual and safety agreements, the disclosure of
   broken sexual and safety agreements, and general relationship
   communication. Using a sample of 395 couples, we found that while
   certain aspects of communication are different for monogamous couples
   compared to open couples, similarities also exist. Specifically, we
   identified no differences in how explicitly couples discussed their
   sexual and safety agreements, attitudes toward communication about
   safety agreements, and mutual avoidance and withholding communication.
   However, monogamous couples had more positive attitudes toward
   communication about sexual agreements. The results were mixed on the
   perceived impact that broken safety agreements had on communication with
   the primary partner. Our results are interpreted with attention to
   relationship well-being and implications for safer sex practices.}},

Abstract = {{Noncovalent chemical interactions, including electrostatic interactions,
   hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions, constitute crucial
   driving forces in the bottom-up assembly of multifunctional molecular
   complexes and nanomaterials. Electrostatic interactions in chemical
   environments are generally considered as non-specific interactions,
   which pose notable challenges for the control and direct measurement of
   electrostatic forces at the single-molecule level. Here, we report a
   model system consisting of cytochrome c and molecules containing
   carboxyl groups, and use electrochemical AFM force spectroscopy to
   navigate the electrostatic forces of the system under various chemical
   conditions. The effects of solution pH, ion strength, and redox states
   of cytochrome c on electrostatic interactions as well as control over
   these parameters are systematically studied. This work provides a useful
   approach for investigating intermolecular electrostatic interactions at
   the single-molecule level.}},

Abstract = {{The boundary layer flow problem for non-Newtonian hybrid nanofluid over
   moving wedge is discussed. The hybrid nanofluid is synthesized by equal
   suspensions of MWCNTs and SiO2 nanoparticles in a binary mixture of
   EG-water. The physical problem is modeled through continuity, momentum,
   and energy equations and a two-parameter rheological model relates shear
   stress to shear rate is used that obey the trend of experimental result.
   The relevant governing equations are simplified form by means of the
   similarity transformation and then solved by an analytical scheme. The
   results are obtained at different nanoparticles volume fractions for
   velocity and temperature profiles and displaced graphically for
   discussion. In addition, displacement and momentum thicknesses are
   calculated numerically to understand the deflation in mass flow rate and
   momentum flux to due to boundary layer growth. The results show that
   velocity profile is reduced due to increasing of viscosity by
   nanoparticle volume fraction. In this consequence, the displacement and
   momentum thicknesses are increased.}},

Abstract = {{High-working potential layered oxides as cathode materials have been
   considered as an effective way to improve the energy density of Na-ion
   batteries (NIBs) to enhance their competitiveness as a promising
   alternative for lithium ion batteries in large-scale energy storage
   applications. However, they generally suffer irreversible phase
   transition, large volume change and electrolyte corrosion when charged
   to high voltage (>4.2 V), resulting in poor cyclic stability. In this
   work, a P2@tunnel heterostructure cathode material is designed and
   obtained by wet chemistry combined with solid-state reaction method.
   Moreover, partly of the Ti4+ ions which are designed for the tunnel
   structure is also doped into the P2 phase under high temperature
   annealing process, resulting in expanded crystal parameters and smooth
   charge-discharge profiles. The stable tunnel structure layer can
   effectively protect the layered P2 type cathode material from corrosion
   by electrolyte upon high voltage and alleviate the crack propagated from
   the particle surface. Therefore, the P2@tunnel heterostructure cathode
   can still maintain a discharge capacity of 146.3 mAh g(-1) while the
   discharge capacity of pristine P2 type cathode is only 114.4 mAh g(-1)
   after 100 cycles at 0.25 C, it also reveals superior cyclic stability
   and rate performance compared to the pristine P2 type cathode.}},

Title = {{Aggregation by peptide conjugation rescues poor immunogenicity of the HA

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},

Abstract = {{Influenza virus infection is a global public health threat. Current
   seasonal influenza vaccines are efficacious only when vaccine strains
   are matched with circulating strains. There is a critical need for
   developing ``universal{''} vaccines that protect against all influenza
   viruses. HA stem is a promising target for developing broad-spectrum
   influenza vaccines due to its relatively conserved feature. However, HA
   stem is weakly immunogenic when administered alone in a soluble form.
   Several approaches have been employed to improve the immunogenicity of
   HA stem, including conjugation of HA stem with a highly immunogenic
   carrier protein or displaying HA stem on a nanoparticle scaffold.
   Converting a weakly immunologic protein into a multimer through
   aggregation can significantly enhance its immunogenicity, with some
   multimeric protein aggregates previously shown to be more immunogenic
   than their soluble counterparts in animal models. Here, we show that a
   chemically coupling a peptide derived from the head domain of PR8 HA
   (P35) with the poorly immunogenic HA stem protein results in aggregation
   of the HA stem which significantly increases stem-specific B cell
   responses following vaccination. Importantly, vaccination with this
   conjugate in the absence of adjuvant still induced robust B cell
   responses against stem in vivo. Improving HA stem immunogenicity by
   aggregation provides an alternative avenue to conjugation with exotic
   carrier proteins or nanoparticle formulation.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{The prostatic tumor cells plasticity is involved in resistance to
   hormone-therapy, allowing these cells to survive despite androgen
   receptor inhibition. However, its role in taxanes resistance has not
   been fully established. Gene expression of plasticity-related phenotypes
   such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), stem cell-like and
   neuroendocrine (NE) phenotypes was studied in vitro, in silico, in
   circulating tumor cells (CTCs) (N=22) and in tumor samples (N=117) from
   taxanes-treated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)
   patients. Docetaxel (D)-resistant cells presented a more pronounced EMT
   phenotype than cabazitaxel (CZ)-resistant cells. In silico analysis
   revealed ESRP1 down-regulation in taxane-exposed mCRPC samples. Cell
   plasticity-related changes occurred in CTCs after taxanes treatment.
   Tumor EMT phenotype was associated with lower PSA progression-free
   survival (PFS) to D (P<0.001), and better to CZ (P=0.002). High ESRP1
   expression was independently associated with longer PSA-PFS (P<0.001)
   and radiologic-PFS (P=0.001) in D and shorter PSA-PFS in the CZ cohort
   (P=0.041). High SYP expression was independently associated with lower
   PSA-PFS in D (P=0.003) and overall survival (OS) in CZ (P=0.002), and
   high EZH2 expression was associated with adverse OS in D-treated
   patients (P=0.013). In conclusion, EMT profile in primary tumor is
   differentially associated with D or CZ benefit and NE dedifferentiation
   correlates with adverse taxanes clinical outcome.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose In rural areas, geographic location is key to market access and
   labor mobility of farm households. This paper aims to investigate the
   opportunities and constraints of smallholder rubber farmers in southwest
   China to adjust to the changes in economic and institutional conditions,
   namely the declining rubber prices, emerging land rental markets and
   growing off-farm job opportunities. Design/methodology/approach The
   empirical basis is a dataset of some 600 rubber farmers in Xishuangbanna
   Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, collected in March 2015. The
   study uses instrumental variable and recursive bivariate probit models
   to account for possible endogeneity and selection bias. Findings With
   rubber prices in decline, the elevation of rubber plantations is an
   essential factor for the costs of access to the local factor markets and
   influences farm households' possibilities to adopt coping strategies.
   Notably, we find a U-shape type of relationship between the location and
   renting-out land due to the decline in rubber profitability. Rubber
   producers in low elevations are better bestowed with access to local
   markets. Households in high elevations, where rubber planting came in
   later, can shift to new crops like tea. However, the economic resilience
   of farmers in middle elevations is low due to their higher adjustment
   costs. Originality/value The paper provides a constructive basis for
   designing more location-specific development policies and can help avoid
   the past often ineffective blanket measures. Its implications have
   significant relevance for areas with similar conditions, for example,
   the remote, ethnic minority-dominated and mountainous rural areas in
   China.}},

Abstract = {{Controlling spoilage of the popular ethnic marinated beef ``Shawarma{''}
   is crucial to achieve high quality, extend shelf-life, reduce food waste
   and meet the need of the globalized supply chain. Active essential oil
   (EO) components (thymol and carvacrol) were added at 0.4\% and 0.8\%
   (w/w) to preserve marinated beef, stored under aerobic or vacuum
   packaging. Microbiological and sensory (odor) parameters were assessed
   during 21 days at 4 degrees C. The treatments with higher EO

   and significantly reduced the mesophilic total viable count (TVC),
   lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Brochothrix thermosphacta, Pseudomonas spp.,
   total coliforms, Escherichia coli, yeasts and molds. The higher EO
   concentration extended the microbiological shelf-life by 6 days, as
   judged by TVC and compared to the controls (aerobic and vacuum

Abstract = {{BackgroundThis differential diagnosis of allergic vs non-allergic asthma
   is typically made on the basis of sensitization to allergens, such that
   absence of sensitization could result in a patient being managed as
   having non-allergic asthma. In Germany, the number of specific allergen
   tests is limited and non-standardized (across clinicians and
   laboratories), with the potential for false negative diagnoses. IDENTIFY
   aimed to gain data on sensitizations toward aeroallergens in patients
   with severe asthma who had tested negative to perennial aeroallergens in
   previous tests.MethodsThis was a single visit, non-randomized,
   non-interventional study conducted in 87 centers across Germany. The
   only inclusion criteria were that patients had to be adults (at least 18
   years of age) with a diagnosis of severe asthma (receiving at least
   Global Initiative for Asthma Step IV therapy), and who had previously
   tested negative to perennial aeroallergens. Patients were then tested
   for sensitization to a panel of 35 perennial aeroallergens, with
   positive sensitization indicated by CAP >= 0.35 kU/L.ResultsOf 588
   patients recruited, 454 had complete and valid data, and had previously
   tested negative to perennial aeroallergens. Overall, 43.6\% of the
   analyzed patients tested positive for at least one of the included
   aeroallergens, with 18.7\% testing positive for three or more, and 4.2\%
   positive for more than ten. The five most common sensitizations were to
   Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B, Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida
   albicans, Dermatophagoides farinae, and Rhizopus nigricans, each of
   which tested positive in at least 9.7\% of the population.ConclusionsIn
   this group of patients being managed as having non-allergic asthma (and
   who had all previously tested negative to perennial aeroallergens), a
   high proportion tested positive to a broad panel of aeroallergens. A
   diagnosis of allergic asthma therefore cannot be excluded purely on the
   basis of standard aeroallergen panels.}},

Title = {{Discrimination of wear and non-wear in infants using data from hip- and
   ankle-worn devices}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Introduction
   A key component to analyzing wearable sensor data is identifying periods
   of non-wear. Traditionally, strings of consecutive zero counts (e.g.
   >60-minutes) are identified indicating periods of non-movement. The
   non-movement window length is then evaluated as wear or non-wear. Given
   that non-movement is not equivalent to non-wear, additional criteria
   should be evaluated to objectively identify periods of non-wear.
   Identifying non-wear is especially challenging in infants due to their
   sporadic movement, sleep frequency, and proportion of
   caregiver-generated movement.
   Purpose
   To use hip- and ankle-worn ActiGraph wGT3X-BT (wGT3X-BT) data to
   identify non-wear in infants.
   Methods
   Fifteen infant participants {[}mean +/- SD; age, 8.7 +/- 1.7 weeks
   (range 5.4-11.3 weeks); 5.1 +/- 0.8 kg; 56.2 +/- 2.1 cm; n = 8 females]
   wore a wGT3X-BT on the hip and ankle. Criterion data were collected
   during two, 2-hour directly observed periods in the laboratory. Using
   raw 30 Hz acceleration data, a vector magnitude and the inclination
   angle of each individual axis were calculated before being averaged into
   1-minute windows. Three decision tree models were developed using data
   from 1) hip only, 2) ankle only, and 3) hip and ankle combined.
   Results
   The hip model classified 86.6\% of all minutes (wear and non-wear)
   correctly (F1 = 75.5\%) compared to the ankle model which classified
   90.6\% of all minutes correctly (F1 = 83.0\%). The combined site model
   performed similarly to the ankle model and correctly classified 90.0\%
   of all minutes (F1 = 80.8\%).
   Conclusion
   The similar performance between the ankle only model and the combined
   site model likely indicates that the features from the ankle device are
   more important for identifying non-wear in infants. Overall, this
   approach provides an advancement in the identification of device wear
   status using wearable sensor data in infants.}},

Title = {{Traffic accident hotspot identification by integrating kernel density
   estimation and spatial autocorrelation analysis: a case study}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CRASHWORTHINESS}},
Abstract = {{The study presented an approach that integrated kernel density
   estimation (KDE) algorithm and spatial autocorrelation analysis, which
   helped to determine traffic accident (TA) hotspot locations and
   simultaneously evaluate the statistical significance of the hotspot
   clusters. Firstly, hotspots were identified by applying a GIS-based KDE
   algorithm. Secondly, the hotspot clusters were evaluated in terms of
   statistical significance by applying the Moran's I statistic indices.
   Finally, hotspots were arranged according to their significance. TA data
   in the (2015-2017) period in Hanoi, Vietnam were applied to test this
   approach. Importantly, the study proposed a validation process for the
   results by applying the Gi{*} statistics method to validate the (H-H)
   clusters and the EPDO method to validate the ranking of hotspots. The
   results showed that this integration overcame the drawbacks of the KDE
   method. The statistical test process of clusters helped to hinder the
   occurrence of too many clusters that were determined by the KDE method
   because they were not really dangerous. This approach was helpful and
   precise in identifying TA hotspots with the statistical meaning. These
   outcomes will not only enable traffic authorities to comprehensively
   understand the reasons for each accident but also to help them manage
   and deal with hazardous areas according to the prior order in case of
   limited expenses and allocate traffic safety sources accordingly.}},

Title = {{Personality Types in Learning Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Abstract = {{This research explores the influence of personality types on ERP system
   learning performance in a university setting. Four personality types
   (labeled Type 1 to 4) were identified using cluster analysis of 176

   conscientiousness, neuroticism, extraversion, openness, and
   agreeableness. These four personality types were found to be
   significantly associated with ERP system learning performance.
   Additionally, prior knowledge, user affect, demographic factors (such as
   gender, age, year in school), and environmental factors (such as
   ethnicity, location, English proficiency) were found to moderate the
   relationships between the four personality types and ERP learning
   performance. These findings can provide valuable insights into the

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND. Pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection can be complicated by a
   dangerous hyperinflammatory condition termed multisystem inflammatory
   syndrome in children (MIS-C). The clinical and immunologic spectrum of
   MIS-C and its relationship to other inflammatory conditions of childhood
   have not been studied in detail.
   METHODS. We retrospectively studied confirmed cases of MIS-C at our
   institution from March to June 2020. The clinical characteristics,
   laboratory studies, and treatment response were collected. Data were
   compared with historic cohorts of Kawasaki disease (KO) and macrophage
   activation syndrome (MAS).
   RESULTS. Twenty-eight patients fulfilled the case definition of MIS-C.
   Median age at presentation was 9 years (range: 1 month to 17 years);
   50\% of patients had preexisting conditions. All patients had laboratory
   confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Seventeen patients (61\%) required
   intensive care, including 7 patients (25\%) who required inotrope
   support. Seven patients (25\%) met criteria for complete or incomplete
   KO, and coronary abnormalities were found in 6 cases. Lymphopenia,
   thrombocytopenia, and elevation in inflammatory markers, D-dimer, B-type
   natriuretic peptide, IL-6, and IL-10 levels were common but not
   ubiquitous. Cytopenias distinguished MIS-C from KO and the degree of
   hyperferritinemia and pattern of cytokine production differed between
   MIS-C and MAS. Immunomodulatory therapy given to patients with MIS-C
   included intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) (71\%), corticosteroids
   (61\%), and anakinra (18\%). Clinical and laboratory improvement were
   observed in all cases, including 6 cases that did not require
   immunomodulatory therapy. No mortality was recorded in this cohort.
   CONCLUSION. MIS-C encompasses a broad phenotypic spectrum with clinical
   and laboratory features distinct from KO and MAS.}},

Abstract = {{Several emergencies were admitted less frequently to the hospital during
   the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. To investigate whether
   this also occurred with status epilepticus (SE) we compared admissions
   due to first SE from March to April 2020 ({''}Time of COVID,{''} TOC)
   with January to February 2020 ({''}pre-COVID,{''} preCOV). We also
   compared admission numbers in TOC and preCOV with the respective 2-month
   periods in 2018 and 2019 in a retrospective cohort analysis. Two
   investigators independently searched the hospital patient database for
   various forms of SE. There was no significant change in the 2-month
   incidences of first SE in the city of Salzburg from preCOV of 6.1 (95\%
   confidence interval {[}CI] 2.9-12.3) to TOC of 6.9/100 000 adults (95\%
   CI 3.4-13.3). Admission numbers did not differ significantly from
   previous years. Estimated adjusted incidence was in line with a recent
   5-year epidemiological study in Salzburg. However, a trend toward
   less-frequent nonconvulsive SE (NCSE) and loss of female predominance
   were indirect hints of underdiagnosing SE. In contrast to other medical
   conditions, SE most often presents clinically with impaired
   consciousness, which may promote admission to emergency departments even
   in times of lock-down. Further research of medical support of women and
   patients with NCSE during pandemic-related restrictions is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{A dual colorimetric and ratiometric fluorescent assay is constructed for
   the detection of glutathione (GSH) based on MnO2 nanosheets (MnO2 NS).
   Amplex Red (AR) and curcumin ( CUR) fluorescence-pairing probes have
   opposite responses to MnO2 NS with fluorescence quenching and
   oxidase-like property. MnO2 nanosheets can largely quench the
   fluorescence of curcumin. However, the fluorescence of oxidized AR
   (oxAR) was obviously raised via the catalytic oxidation reaction of no
   fluorescent AR. The color of the solution gradually changes from yellow
   to orange. However, MnO2 nanosheets lose the fluorescence quenching
   capacity and oxidase-like property after the addition of GSH. Therefore,
   the fluorescence intensity of curcumin shows an obvious increase and the
   intensity of oxAR a decrease, accompanied by the restoration of the
   solution color from orange to yellow. For MnO2 nanosheets, the linear
   relationship between the absorbance ratio of the two substrates and the
   GSH concentration (50-15 000 nM) is obtained with the detection limit of
   16 nM. Besides, the ratiometric fluorescent method has a good linear
   range from 10 to 5000 nM for GSH. The detection limit is as low as 4.2
   nM. Further, this method can not only be used for the determination of
   GSH in an aqueous solution but also shows a high responsive ability to
   GSH in human serum. This result indicates its potential in bioanalysis
   and disease diagnosis.}},

   Hemihepatectomy: A Propensity Score Matching Analysis}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background Laparoscopic major liver resection, such as laparoscopic left
   hemihepatectomy (LLH), is still perceived as a complicated procedure due
   to technical difficulties and slow learning curve. The study introduced
   an optimized procedure using the liver parenchyma transection-first
   approach and investigated its advantages on surgical outcomes by
   comparison with the conventional hilar dissection approach for LLH.
   Methods Between January 2015 and May 2019, 96 patients who underwent
   laparoscopic left hemihepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
   were enrolled in the study. Among these, 41 patients underwent the liver
   parenchyma transection-first approach (LP-first group) and the other 55
   underwent the conventional hilar dissection approach (conventional
   group). A 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to compare
   the perioperative and long-term oncological outcomes of the two groups.
   Results After 1:1 PSM, 37 patients in each group were selected for
   further analysis. The LP-first group was associated with shorter median
   operative time (210 vs 235 min, P = 0.035) and less blood loss (200 vs
   300 mL, P = 0.410). In addition, no statistical differences were found
   in overall complications between the two groups (8.1\% vs 24.3\%, P =
   0.058). There were no significant differences between the two groups in
   terms of 1-year and 3-year disease-free survival (DFS, P = 0.608) and
   overall survival (OS, P = 0.414). Conclusion The prior liver parenchyma
   approach for LLH is safe and reproducible in selected patients, which
   showed improved perioperative outcomes and comparable long-term
   oncological outcomes compared with the conventional approach.}},

Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Income and education are both elements of a person's socioeconomic
   status, which is predictive of a broad range of life outcomes. The
   brain's gray matter volume (GMV) is influenced by socioeconomic status
   and mediators related to an unhealthy life style. We here investigated
   two independent general population samples comprising 2838 participants
   (all investigated with the same MRI-scanner) with regard to the
   association of indicators of the socioeconomic status and gray matter
   volume. Voxel-based morphometry without prior hypotheses revealed that
   years of education were positively associated with GMV in the anterior
   cingulate cortex and net-equivalent income with gray matter volume in
   the hippocampus/amygdala region. Analyses of possible mediators
   (alcohol, cigarettes, body mass index (BMI), stress) revealed that the
   relationship between income and GMV in the hippocampus/amygdala region
   was partly mediated by self-reported stressors, and the association of
   years of education with GMV in the anterior cingulate cortex by BMI.
   These results corrected for whole brain effects (and therefore not
   restricted to certain brain areas) do now offer possibilities for more
   detailed hypotheses-driven approaches.}},

Abstract = {{25-hydroxy vitamin D {[}25-(OH)D] is widely used to determine vitamin D
   status in clinic. The aim of our study was to evaluate the prognostic
   value of 25-(OH)D in extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma (ENKTL). Ninety-three
   (93) ENKTL patients with available serum 25-(OH)D values were enrolled
   in our study. Vitamin D deficiency is defined as a 25-(OH)D below 50
   nmol/L (20 ng/ml). Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were
   performed to determine independent risk factors for progression-free
   survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Receiver operator
   characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted, and corresponding areas under
   the curves (AUC) were calculated to estimate the accuracy of PINK-E
   (prognostic index of natural killer lymphoma added with Epstein-Barr
   virus-DNA status) and 25-(OH)D deficiency in ENKTL risk-stratification.
   Our results suggested that the vitamin D deficiency was an independent
   inferior prognostic factor for both PFS {[}hazard ratio (HR), 2.869;
   95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.540 to 5.346; P = 0.003] and OS (HR,
   3.204; 95\% CI, 1.559 to 6.583; P = 0.006) in patients with ENKTL.
   Additionally, we demonstrated that adding 25-(OH)D deficiency to PINK-E
   score system indeed has a superior prognostic significance than PINK-E
   alone for PFS {[}AUC: 0.796 (95\% CI: 0.699 to 0.872) vs. 0.759 (95\%
   CI: 0.659 to 0.841), P = 0.020] and OS {[}AUC: 0.755 (95\% CI: 0.655 to
   0.838) vs. 0.721 (95\% CI: 0.618 to 0.809), P = 0.040]. In conclusion,
   our study proved that 25-(OH)D deficiency was associated with inferior
   survival outcome of ENKTL patients.}},

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Pages = {{387-405}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper addresses issues of agency and self-identity on the basis of
   a phenomenology of embodiment. It considers a tension in accounts of
   embodiment between, on the one hand, the body as the locus of
   subjectivity, lived experience, and agency, and, on the other hand, the
   body as constructed, as the site where discursive regimes of power are
   inscribed. In exploring this tension I consider Frantz Fanon's and Sarah
   Ahmed's phenomenological accounts of racism to illustrate the ways in
   which social power and violence come to be implicated in these conflicts
   within our embodied identities. I also consider Foucauldian ``power{''}
   in relation to Merleau-Ponty's concept of ``institution.{''} I argue
   that only the phenomenological concept of institution, by drawing our
   attention to the ambiguities of lived embodiment, succeeds in offering
   us resources for thinking about the interplay between passivity and
   agency in the life of the subject, and, in particular, about a form of
   agency not wholly reducible to the effects of power.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - Although positive psychology emphasizes the importance of
   reflecting on success in promoting strengths use and self-efficacy, no
   research has developed a measure of reflection on success. The purpose
   of this study is to develop and validate the scales for reflection on
   success and failures.
   Design/methodology/approach - Study 1 was conducted to extract the
   dimensions of reflection on success and failures using survey data from
   nurses (n = 298), whereas Study 2 involved validation of the scales
   using a two-wave survey of physical therapists (n = 291).
   Findings - In Study 1, the factors of ``reflection on success{''} and
   ``reflection on failures{''} were extracted by exploratory factor
   analysis. In Study 2, the discriminant validity of the two scales was
   established via confirmatory factor analyses. The structural equation
   modeling results indicated that reflection on success promoted work
   authenticity, work engagement and strengths use, while reflection on
   failures only promoted work engagement, indicating the convergent
   validity of the scales.
   Research limitations/implications - As the research subjects were
   medical professionals in Japan, the scales need to be validated with
   samples from a wide range of occupations and cultural backgrounds, in
   future research.
   Originality/value - The present research expands the literature on
   reflection and strengths-based approach by introducing the
   ``success-failures{''} dimension based on positive psychology,
   broaden-and-build theory and job demands-resources theory.}},

   aspiration is more labor-intensive but yields information on species
   attracted to specific hosts as well as their biting rates. Sampling
   immatures is discussed with respect to choosing collection sites in
   semiaquatic mud, soil, and rich organic habitats. Sorting and extracting
   larvae using emergence traps, flotation, and Berlese funnels is also
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Big data and mobile technology are widely claimed to be global
   disruptive forces in agriculture that benefit small-scale farmers. Yet
   the access of small-scale farmers to this technology is poorly
   understood. We show that only 24-37\% of farms of <1 ha in size are
   served by third generation (3G) or 4G services, compared to 74-80\% of
   farms of >200 ha in size. Furthermore, croplands with severe yield gaps,
   climate-stressed locations and food-insecure populations have poor
   service coverage. Across many countries in Africa, less than similar to
   40\% of farming households have Internet access, and the cost of data
   remains prohibitive. We recommend a digital inclusion agenda whereby
   governments, the development community and the private sector focus
   their efforts to improve access so that data-driven agriculture is
   available to all farmers globally.}},

Abstract = {{X-ray microtomography (microCT) enables histological-scale 3D imaging of
   many types of biological samples, but it has yet to rival traditional
   histology for differentiation of tissue types and cell components. This
   report presents prima facie results indicating that a simple lead(II)
   acetate staining solution can impart preferential X-ray contrast to cell
   nuclei. While not strictly selective for nuclei, the staining reflects
   local cell-density differences. It can be applied in a single overnight
   treatment and does not require hematoxylin staining or drying of the
   sample. The stain is removable with EDTA, and it may enhance early
   calcifications. A basic protocol is given as a guide for further testing
   and optimization.}},

Abstract = {{Background Organizational changes in out-of-hour (OOH) services may have
   unintended consequences for other prehospital services. Reports indicate
   an increased use of helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) after
   changes in OOH services in Norway due to greater geographical distances
   for the on-call doctors. We investigated whether HEMS dispatches
   increased when nine municipalities in Sogn og Fjordane County merged
   into one large inter-municipal OOH district. Methods All primary
   dispatches of the HEMS in the county between 2004 and 2013 were
   included. We applied interrupted time series regression to monthly
   aggregated data to evaluate the impact of the organizational change 1
   April 2009. The nine target municipalities were compared to the rest of
   the municipalities in the county, which served as a control group. A
   quasipoisson model adjusted for seasonality was found to be most
   applicable. Results We included 8,751 dispatches, 5,009 (57.2\%) of
   which were completed with a patient encounter. Overall, we found no
   alteration in requests for HEMS after 2009 (p = 0.251). Separate
   analyses of the target municipalities and control group revealed no
   significant increase after 2009 (p = 0.400 and p = 0.056, respectively).
   When categorizing the municipalities into urban or rural, we found a
   general increase in HEMS dispatches for the rural group over the 10-year
   span (p = 0.045) but no added increase after 2009 (p = 0.502). The urban
   subgroup showed no change. Distance from the OOH service in regards to
   travel increased within the nine municipalities after 2009, median
   {[}quartiles] (5.0{[}3.0, 6.2] km vs 26.5{[}5.0, 62.2] km, p < 0.001).
   Conclusion After relocating nine local OOH services into one large
   inter-municipal OOH district, we found no increase in requests for HEMS.}},

Abstract = {{Two bacterial strains, 172606-1(T) and BT10(T), were isolated from soil,
   Korea. Both strains were Gram-stain-negative and rod-shaped bacteria.
   Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that
   strain 172606-1(T) formed a distinct lineage within the family
   Cytophagaceae (order Cytophagales, class Cytophagia, phylum
   Bacteroidetes). Strain 172606-1(T) was most closely related to a member
   of the genus Rhodocytophaga (93.8\% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to
   Rhodocytophaga aerolata 5416T-29(T)). The complete genome sequence of
   strain 172606-1(T) is 8,983,451 bp size. Optimal growth occurred at 25
   degrees C and pH 7.0 without NaCl. The major cellular fatty acids were
   identified as iso-C-15:0 and C-16:1 omega 5c. The major respiratory
   quinone was MK-7. The major polar lipid was phosphatidylethanolamine.
   Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that
   strain BT10(T) belongs to the genus Nibribacter and is closely related
   to Nibribacter koreensis GSR 3061(T) (96.5\%), Rufibacter glacialis
   MDT1-10-3(T) (95.7\%), Rufibacter sediminis H-1(T) (95.1\%) and
   Rufibacter quisquiliarum CAI-18b(T) (94.9\%). The complete genome
   sequence of strain BT10(T) is 4,374,810 bp size. The predominant (>
   10\%) cellular fatty acids of strain BT10(T) were iso-C-15:0 and summed
   feature 4 (anteiso-C-17:1 B/iso-C-17:1 I) and a predominant quinone was
   MK-7. In addition, strain BT10(T) has phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) as
   the major polar lipid. On the basis of biochemical, chemotaxonomic and
   phylogenetic analyses, strain 172606-1(T) represents a novel bacterial
   species of the genus Rhodocytophaga, for which the name Rhodocytophaga
   rosea is proposed and strain BT10(T) represents a novel species of the
   genus Nibribacter, for which the name Nibribacter ruber is proposed. The
   type strains of Rhodocytophaga rosea and Nibribacter ruber are

Abstract = {{In animals, cell-matrix adhesions are essential for cell migration,
   tissue organization, and differentiation, which have central roles in
   embryonic development {[}1-6]. Integrins are the major cell surface
   adhesion receptors mediating cell-matrix adhesion in animals. They are
   heterodimeric transmembrane proteins that bind extracellular matrix
   (ECM) molecules on one side and connect to the actin cytoskeleton on the
   other {[}7]. Given the importance of integrin-mediated cell-matrix
   adhesion in development of multicellular animals, it is of interest to
   discover when and how this machinery arose during evolution. Comparative
   genomic analyses have shown that core components of the integrin
   adhesome pre-date the emergence of animals {[}8-11]; however, whether it
   mediates cell adhesion in non-metazoan taxa remains unknown. Here, we
   investigate cell-substrate adhesion in Capsaspora owczarzaki, the
   closest unicellular relative of animals with the most complete integrin
   adhesome {[}11, 12]. Previous work described that the life cycle of C.
   owczarzaki (hereafter, Capsaspora) includes three distinct life stages:
   adherent; cystic; and aggregative {[}13]. Using an adhesion assay, we
   show that, during the adherent life stage, C. owczarzaki adheres to
   surfaces using actin-dependent filopodia. We show that integrin b2 and
   its associated protein vinculin localize as distinct patches in the
   filopodia. We also demonstrate that substrate adhesion and integrin
   localization are enhanced by mammalian fibronectin. Finally, using a
   specific antibody for integrin b2, we inhibited cell adhesion to a
   fibronectin-coated surface. Our results suggest that adhesion to the
   substrate in C. owczarzaki is mediated by integrins. Wethus propose that
   integrin-mediated adhesion pre-dates the emergence of animals.}},

Abstract = {{Mounting evidence shows that long noncoding RNAs play important roles in
   human diseases and radioresistance could be an important factor for
   tumor recurrence. We observed that HOX antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR)
   expression increased in invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) tissue. The
   irradiation effect of HOTAIR was detected by
   3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl
   )-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay, cell cycle and apoptosis analysis, and
   xenografts in nude mice. Western blot, RNA pulldown assay, and RNA
   immunoprecipitation were used for mechanistic studies. HOTAIR,
   upregulated in IDC of breast cancer tissue, could promote breast cancer
   cell proliferation by regulating cell cycle and apoptosis.
   Overexpression of HOTAIR promoted DNA damage repair factors KU70, KU80,
   DNA-PKs, and ATM expression, and these could be impeded by small
   molecular inhibitors of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2). Meanwhile,
   we found that HOTAIR could facilitate recruitment of EZH2 to the Avian
   Myelocytomatosis Viral Oncogene Homolog (MYC) promoter. HOTAIR is an
   important modulator not only to the prognostic of breast cancer, but
   also a good marker for radiotherapy.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{18}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Current-induced spin-orbit torques (SOTs) in heavy metal/ferromagnet
   heterostructures have emerged as an efficient method for magnetization
   switching with applications in nonvolatile magnetic memory and logic
   devices. However, experimental realization of SOT switching of
   perpendicular magnetization requires an additional inversion symmetry
   breaking, calling for modifications of the conventional SOT
   heterostructures. In this work, we study SOTs and deterministic
   switching of perpendicular magnetization by inserting different
   asymmetric dusting layers at the heavy metal/ferromagnet interface.
   Similar to the previous works with lateral structural asymmetry, we
   study the emergence of current-induced perpendicular effective magnetic
   fields (H-z(eff)). By examining three different material combinations of
   heavy metal/dusting layers (W/IrMn, Pt/IrMn, and W/Ta), we shed light on
   the origins of H-z(eff); we show that H-z(eff) is generically created in
   all the studied asymmetric structures, has a close correlation with the
   interfacial magnetic anisotropy, and is independent of the signs of spin
   Hall angles of the materials. Furthermore, we show that the induction of
   H-z(eff) enables field-free deterministic SOT switching of perpendicular
   magnetization. Our results can be used in designing SOT heterostructures
   for practical applications in nonvolatile technologies.}},

Title = {{Sensitivity of modeled snow stability data to meteorological input
   uncertainty}},

Abstract = {{To perform spatial snow cover simulations for numerical avalanche
   forecasting, interpolation and downscaling of meteorological data are
   required, which introduce uncertainties. The repercussions of these
   uncertainties on modeled snow stability remain mostly unknown. We
   therefore assessed the contribution of meteorological input uncertainty
   to modeled snow stability by performing a global sensitivity analysis.
   We used the numerical snow cover model SNOWPACK to simulate two snow
   instability metrics, i.e., the skier stability index and the critical
   crack length, for a field site equipped with an automatic weather
   station providing the necessary input for the model. Simulations were
   performed for a winter season, which was marked by a prolonged dry
   period at the beginning of the season. During this period, the snow
   surface layers transformed into layers of faceted and depth hoar
   crystals, which were subsequently buried by snow. The early-season snow
   surface was likely the weak layer of many avalanches later in the
   season. Three different scenarios were investigated to better assess the
   influence of meteorological forcing on snow stability during (a) the
   weak layer formation period, (b) the slab formation period, and (c) the
   weak layer and slab formation period. For each scenario, 14 000
   simulations were performed, by introducing quasi-random uncertainties to
   the meteorological input. Uncertainty ranges for meteorological forcing
   covered typical differences observed within a distance of 2 km or an
   elevation change of 200 m. Results showed that a weak layer formed in
   99.7\% of the simulations, indicating that the weak layer formation was
   very robust due to the prolonged dry period. For scenario a, modeled
   grain size of the weak layer was mainly sensitive to precipitation,
   while the shear strength of the weak layer was sensitive to most input
   variables, especially air temperature. Once the weak layer existed (case
   b), precipitation was the most prominent driver for snow stability. The
   sensitivity analysis highlighted that for all scenarios, the two
   stability metrics were mostly sensitive to precipitation. Precipitation
   determined the load of the slab, which in turn influenced weak layer
   properties. For cases b and c, the two stability metrics showed
   contradicting behaviors. With increasing precipitation, i.e., deep
   snowpacks, the skier stability index decreased (became less stable). In
   contrast, the critical crack length increased with increasing
   precipitation (became more stable). With regard to spatial simulations
   of snow stability, the high sensitivity to precipitation suggests that
   accurate precipitation patterns are necessary to obtain realistic snow
   stability patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives We aimed (1) to assess the repeatability of Total Keratometry
   (TK) and standard keratometry (K) measurements, as provided by the
   IOLMaster 700 (Carl Zeiss Meditec), and (2) to compare the corneal
   astigmatism measured by TK to the total corneal astigmatism (TCA)
   measured by a Scheimpflug camera (Pentacam AXL, Oculus). Methods Two
   groups of patients were prospectively enrolled: Group A included
   previously unoperated eyes undergoing cataract surgery, and Group B eyes
   with previous myopic corneal excimer laser surgery. TK and K were
   measured three times by the same examiner. Repeatability was assessed
   based on the within-subject standard deviation (S-w), test-retest
   variability, coefficient of variation and intraclass correlation
   coefficient (ICC). In Group A, TCA was measured once and compared to TK
   astigmatism. Vector analysis was performed according to N AE ser.
   Results In Group A (69 eyes) the mean K and TK were, respectively, 43.14
   +/- 1.37 D and 43.18 +/- 1.37 D. In Group B (51 eyes) the mean K and TK
   were, respectively, 40.14 +/- 2.20 D and 39.71 +/- 2.35 D. The
   repeatability of the average K and TK was high (S-w < 0.10D). All
   measurements revealed an ICC > 0.9. For most measurements the variance
   of K and TK did not show any statistically significant difference either
   within groups or between groups. Vectors KP(45) were significantly
   different between TK astigmatism and TCA. Conclusions TK measurements
   offer high repeatability in unoperated and post-excimer laser surgery
   eyes. TK astigmatism and TCA measurements could not be considered
   interchangeable.}},

Title = {{Simulated moving bed reactor for p-xylene production: Modeling,

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{225}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{A Simulated Moving Bed Reactor (SMBR), comprising a homogeneous mixture
   of adsorbent and catalyst, can overcome the equilibrium constraints in
   the production of p-xylene (PX). In this proposal, toluene and benzene
   were respectively considered as desorbent in the process. The
   arrangement of columns and optimum operating conditions such as
   switching time and flow rates that lead to maximum p-xylene productivity
   and minimum desorbent consumption were determined. Several constraints,
   including maximum pressure drop per bed and purity, were considered.
   Additionally, the operating temperature was optimized for the first time
   taking into account the energy consumption within the associated
   distillation columns; the heat integration involving the distillation
   columns was also discussed. Finally, toluene showed better performance
   than benzene as desorbent. For the best case studied, the optimized
   temperature was 540 K. Moreover, an increase of about 25\% in the
   recovery of PX, compared to the conventional Simulated Moving Bed, was
   obtained. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The high-resistance faults at the far end are the most important factor
   that causes protection failure of HVDC transmission lines. In the
   initial stage of the transmission lines fault, the transient information
   of power grid is abundant, and the sequential overlapping derivative
   (SOD) transform can emphasise the characteristics of the high-frequency
   transient signal and its sudden change direction, amplify fault
   characteristics, and eliminate noise as far as possible, which is of
   great benefit to identify the high-resistance faults at the far end. A
   fault identification method based on the SOD transform of voltage
   transient is proposed. In this method, the initial fault voltage
   travelling wave is processed by the SOD transform, and the initial fault
   voltage is a travelling wave is quickly detected. The set value of SOD
   transform is obtained according to the traversal simulation fault
   location, thus the identification criteria of internal and external
   faults are obtained. The simulation results show that the method can
   accurately identify the high-resistance faults at the far end, and it is
   hardly affected by transition resistance and fault distance.}},

Abstract = {{The highly variable conformational landscape of N-allylmethylamine (AMA)
   was investigated using Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy aided by
   high-level theoretical calculations to understand the energy
   relationship governing the interconversion between nine stable
   conformers. Spectroscopically, transitions belonging to four low energy
   conformers were identified and their hyperfine patterns owing to the
   N-14 quadrupolar nucleus were unambiguously resolved. The rotational
   spectrum of the global minimum geometry, conformer I, shows an
   additional splitting associated with a tunneling motion through an
   energy barrier interconnecting its enantiomeric forms. A two-step
   tunneling trajectory is proposed by finding transition state structures
   corresponding to the allyl torsion and NH inversion. Natural bond
   orbital and non-covalent interaction analyses reveal that an interplay
   between steric and hyperconjugative effects rules the conformational
   preferences of AMA.}},

Title = {{NGS-based expanded carrier screening for genetic disorders in North

Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Background To determine the carrier frequency and pathogenic variants of
   common genetic disorders in the north Indian population by using next
   generation sequencing (NGS). Methods After pre-test counselling, 200
   unrelated individuals (including 88 couples) were screened for
   pathogenic variants in 88 genes by NGS technology. The variants were
   classified as per American College of Medical Genetics criteria.
   Pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants were subjected to thorough
   literature-based curation in addition to the regular filters. Variants
   of unknown significance were not reported. Individuals were counselled
   explaining the implications of the results, and cascade screening was
   advised when necessary. Results Of the 200 participants, 52 (26\%) were
   found to be carrier of one or more disorders. Twelve individuals were
   identified to be carriers for congenital deafness, giving a carrier
   frequency of one in 17 for one of the four genes tested (SLC26A4, GJB2,
   TMPRSS3 and TMC1 in decreasing order). Nine individuals were observed to
   be carriers for cystic fibrosis, with a frequency of one in 22. Three
   individuals were detected to be carriers for Pompe disease (frequency
   one in 67). None of the 88 couples screened were found to be carriers
   for the same disorder. The pathogenic variants observed in many
   disorders (such as deafness, cystic fibrosis, Pompe disease, Canavan
   disease, primary hyperoxaluria, junctional epidermolysis bullosa,
   galactosemia, medium chain acyl CoA deficiency etc.) were different from
   those commonly observed in the West. Conclusion A higher carrier
   frequency for genetic deafness, cystic fibrosis and Pompe disease was
   unexpected, and contrary to the generally held view about their
   prevalence in Asian Indians. In spite of the small sample size, this
   study would suggest that population-based carrier screening panels for
   India would differ from those in the West, and need to be selected with
   due care. Testing should comprise the study of all the coding exons with
   its boundaries in the genes through NGS, as all the variants are not
   well characterized. Only study of entire coding regions in the genes
   will detect carriers with adequate efficiency, in order to reduce the
   burden of genetic disorders in India and other resource poor countries.}},

Title = {{External validation of prognostic models predicting pre-eclampsia:
   individual participant data meta-analysis}},
Journal = {{BMC MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: Pre-eclampsia is a leading cause of maternal and perinatal
   mortality and morbidity. Early identification of women at risk during
   pregnancy is required to plan management. Although there are many
   published prediction models for pre-eclampsia, few have been validated
   in external data. Our objective was to externally validate published
   prediction models for pre-eclampsia using individual participant data
   (IPD) from UK studies, to evaluate whether any of the models can
   accurately predict the condition when used within the UK healthcare
   setting.
   Methods: IPD from 11 UK cohort studies (217,415 pregnant women) within
   the International Prediction of Pregnancy Complications (IPPIC)
   pre-eclampsia network contributed to external validation of published
   prediction models, identified by systematic review. Cohorts that
   measured all predictor variables in at least one of the identified
   models and reported pre-eclampsia as an outcome were included for
   validation. We reported the model predictive performance as
   discrimination (C-statistic), calibration (calibration plots,
   calibration slope, calibration-in-the-large), and net benefit.
   Performance measures were estimated separately in each available study
   and then, where possible, combined across studies in a random-effects
   meta-analysis.
   Results: Of 131 published models, 67 provided the full model equation
   and 24 could be validated in 11 UK cohorts. Most of the models showed
   modest discrimination with summary C-statistics between 0.6 and 0.7. The
   calibration of the predicted compared to observed risk was generally
   poor for most models with observed calibration slopes less than 1,
   indicating that predictions were generally too extreme, although
   confidence intervals were wide. There was large between-study
   heterogeneity in each model's calibration-in-the-large, suggesting poor
   calibration of the predicted overall risk across populations. In a
   subset of models, the net benefit of using the models to inform clinical
   decisions appeared small and limited to probability thresholds between 5
   and 7\%.
   Conclusions: The evaluated models had modest predictive performance,
   with key limitations such as poor calibration (likely due to overfitting
   in the original development datasets), substantial heterogeneity, and
   small net benefit across settings. The evidence to support the use of
   these prediction models for pre-eclampsia in clinical decision-making is
   limited. Any models that we could not validate should be examined in
   terms of their predictive performance, net benefit, and heterogeneity
   across multiple UK settings before consideration for use in practice.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a method for registering unorganized point
   clouds without using targets or markers. Motivated by the 4-points
   congruent sets (4PCS) algorithm, which is a nontarget-based registration
   method commonly used in the related fields, we develop a feature-based
   4PCS algorithm (F-4PCS). The method combines the basic approach of the
   4PCS algorithm with geometric feature information to produce consistent
   global registration results efficiently. We use the features from the
   point feature histogram descriptor and the ones that capture the surface
   curvature. The experimental results show that the proposed method
   successfully registers point clouds of both the outdoor and indoor
   scenes and demonstrates better performance than the existing 4PCS-based
   registration methods.}},

Abstract = {{Acne is a chronic inflammatory relapsing disease that affect
   predominantly adolescents, with scarring as a frequent sequele. Early
   and appropriate therapy allows better management of the disease, longer
   remission, scars risk reduction, and improvement of quality of life.
   According to therapeutic algorithm, systemic isotretinoin can be used in
   severe acne and also in moderate forms resistant to other systemic
   treatments. The aims of this real-life observational study were to
   determine and compare the effectiveness of isotretinoin evaluated by
   Global Acne Grading System and Acne Quality of Life in moderate and in
   severe acne, correlation between efficacy and cumulative dose of
   isotretinoin, tolerability, and recurrence rate. Moreover, the
   differences in efficacy and tolerability between male and female
   patients were compared. The treatment with systemic isotretinoin led to
   an improvement in acne severity and quality of life in all observed
   subjects.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RELIGION \& HEALTH}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{2620-2631}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The article addressed the key psychological issues that arise in
   encounters between the world of analytical psychotherapy and the inner
   world of patients belonging to the ultraorthodox (Haredi) community in
   Israel. The ultraorthodox community is characterized by isolationism and
   withdrawal, whether as a means of protecting itself from the influence
   of unacceptable lifestyles or as an ideal that eschews mingling with
   secular or semi-secular communities. Thus, the community maintains
   itself apart from the mainstream Israeli public in terms of its
   religious beliefs and independent culture. Ultraorthodox leadership has
   been instrumental in building fences around the community in order to
   preserve its unique identity and clear-cut rules of conduct. The article
   reviews the internal conflicts that exist between the ultraorthodox
   belief system and the values of dynamic psychotherapy, the presence of
   the ``analytic third{''}-God-in the therapeutic space occupied by the
   therapist and patient, and the fear of ``knowledge{''} that exposes
   members of the community to existential questions over unquestioning
   acceptance of the community's social authority. Two case studies are
   presented that shed light on the incongruity that exists between
   sanctification by the ultraorthodox community of the halachic (Jewish
   law) authority of its rabbis and the psychoanalytical viewpoint that
   upholds self and subjectivity as prime goals in therapy.}},

Title = {{Dark D-brane cosmology: From background evolution to cosmological
   perturbations}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW D}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 2}},
Abstract = {{We study the cosmological predictions of the dark D-brane model, in
   which dark matter resides on a D-brane moving in a higher-dimensional
   space. By construction, dark matter interacts only gravitationally with
   the standard model sector in this framework. The dark energy scalar
   field is associated with the position of the D-brane, and its dynamics
   is encoded in a Dirac-Born-Infeld action. On the other hand, dark matter
   is identified with matter on the D-brane, that naturally couples to dark
   energy via a disformal coupling. We analyze the numerical evolution of
   the cosmological background, highlighting the fact that there are two
   regimes of interest: one in which the coupling is positive throughout
   and another in which the coupling is negative at the present. In the
   latter, there is the enticing possibility of having scenarios in which
   the coupling is positive for a significant part of the evolution, before
   decreasing toward negative values. In both cases, the coupling is very
   small at early times and starts to grow only during the late
   matter-dominated era. We also derive the equations for the linear
   cosmological perturbations and an expression for the effective
   time-dependent gravitational coupling between dark matter particles and
   present the numerical results for the cosmic microwave background
   anisotropy and matter power spectra. This allows for a direct comparison
   of the predictions for the growth of large-scale structure with other
   disformal quintessence models.}},
