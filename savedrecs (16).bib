Title = {{Callous-Unemotional Traits Trajectories Interact with Earlier Conduct

Abstract = {{Callous-unemotional (CU) traits, conduct problems (CP), and deficits in
   executive control are all linked to the development of more severe
   antisocial behavior, including violence and substance use. Though
   previous research has examined the impact of these factors on antisocial
   outcomes, little work has examined trajectories of CU traits across
   adolescence and how these trajectories predict greater antisocial
   behavior in adulthood. Moreover, no study has assessed how severity of
   early CP and executive control may exacerbate these pathways and
   increase risk for later violence and substance use. The current study
   (a) identified trajectories of CU traits among a large, high-risk sample
   of adolescent males, (b) examined the relationship between CU traits
   trajectories and future violence and substance use, and (c) examined
   whether early CP and executive control moderated the effects of a high
   CU traits trajectory membership and high CP on violence and substance
   use. Results indicated that: (a) CU traits could be grouped into three
   stable trajectories across adolescence, (b) the `high' CU traits
   trajectory, particularly in the presence of `elevated' CP, was related
   to higher violence and substance use, over and above a variety of
   environmental risk factors, and (c) the effects the `high' CU traits
   trajectory on both violence and substance and in the presence of
   `elevated' CP was stronger among youth with high executive control.
   These findings highlight the utility of identifying subgroups of youth
   who differ on trajectories of CU traits for understanding the
   development and maintenance of severe antisocial behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Predicted pH decreases in ocean surface waters of similar to 0.3-0.5 and
   0.7-0.8 pH units (for 2100 and 2300, respectively) are expected to
   negatively affect calcification processes and physiological performances
   of many marine organisms. Here we evaluated the response of important
   parameters such as growth, mortality, oxygen consumption, and
   mineralization of transplanted Pinna nobilis juveniles in the naturally
   acidified waters of a CO2 vent system. Our field experiments show a
   general decrease of physiological responses of juveniles for the studied
   parameters along a decreasing pH gradient, even if significant effects
   are only observed under pH values of 7.6 units ({''}extreme{''} pH). In
   particular, the mortality rate increased from 10-30 \% over the study
   period at control conditions to 60-70 \% at extreme pH values. We
   conclude that near-future decreases in pH (decreases of 0.3-0.5 pH
   units) may not have a significant effect on performance of P. nobilis
   juveniles, while predicted longer-term decreases (decreases of 0.7-0.8
   pH units) could affect the survival of the species. The combination of
   laboratory experiments with the assessment of naturally acidified
   environments can provide further insights into the threshold pH
   affecting the performance of vulnerable marine species.}},

Abstract = {{Grounding system engineers and power utility owners have a duty of care
   to ensure that substation grounding systems continue to meet their
   safety performance requirements over the operational lifetime of the
   installation. Changes to power system or third-party assets associated
   with an installation, as well as environmental factors such as
   temperature or moisture level fluctuations, can cause variation in a
   grounding system's performance. To perform a grounding system
   assessment, engineers must select a suitable set of fault scenarios on
   which to base their assessments. However, the relative risk level of
   hazards produced by a ground fault (GF) depends on that proportion of
   the fault current that passes to ground through the local grounding of
   the installation and the duration of the event. The consideration of all
   hazards posed by a single installation is thus physically and
   theoretically an expensive proposition, particularly for installations
   with complex grounding systems. An electronic recording system is
   proposed to capture the characteristics of power system ground potential
   rise (GPR) events during GFs. This system allows the failure of critical
   grounding system components to be highlighted as indicated by a
   substantial change in the measured impedance. The system also
   establishes the GPR event frequency, allowing the probabilistic nature
   of GFs associated with an installation to be assessed. This paper
   provides an explanation of the GPR monitoring rationale and a
   methodology for implementing such a system, and typical results are
   shown from trials undertaken in recent years.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Synaptic plasticity serves as a cellular substrate for information
   storage in the central nervous system. The entorhinal cortex (EC) and
   hippocampus are interconnected brain areas supporting basic cognitive
   functions important for the formation and retrieval of declarative
   memories. Here, we discuss how information flow in the EC-hippocampal
   loop is organized through circuit design. We highlight recently
   identified corticohippocampal and intrahippocampal connections and how
   these long-range and local microcircuits contribute to learning. This
   review also describes various forms of activity-dependent mechanisms
   that change the strength of corticohippocampal synaptic transmission. A
   key point to emerge from these studies is that patterned activity and
   interaction of coincident inputs gives rise to associational plasticity
   and long-term regulation of information flow. Finally, we offer insights
   about how learning-related synaptic plasticity within the
   corticohippocampal circuit during sensory experiences may enable
   adaptive behaviors for encoding spatial, episodic, social, and
   contextual memories.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by biased processing
   of emotional information. However, little research in this area has been
   conducted in youth with BD and at-risk individuals. The goal of this
   study was to determine whether children with BD displayed comparable or
   more severe manifestations of this bias relative to offspring of parents
   with BD. Materials and methods: The sample (n=57 children and
   adolescents) included 18 individuals with BD (age: 13.632.99; 8
   females), 16 offspring of parents with BD (age: 11.832.96; 9 females)
   and 23 healthy controls (HC) (age: 12.789 +/- 3.087; 8 females). All
   participants performed the Affective Go/No-Go (AGN) and the Rapid Visual
   Processing (RVP) tasks of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test
   Automated Battery (CANTAB). Results: Relative to HC, individuals with BD
   responded faster to correct trials and committed an elevated number of
   commission errors across all affective conditions of the AGN task. By
   contrast, BD offspring showed intact performance accuracy but quicker
   response times than HC. Post-hoc analyses revealed that this behavioral
   pattern was observed in BD offspring with mental health problems but not
   in healthy BD offspring. Overall, mean reaction times and total number
   of errors in the RVP task were comparable across groups. Conclusions: In
   line with previous findings, subjects with BD encountered difficulties
   in processing affective information. The tendency toward faster but
   accurate responses to affective stimuli observed in BD offspring may be
   a marker of attentional bias toward affective information and constitute
   a vulnerability marker for mood disorder.}},

Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{261-266}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background. Shoulder instability affects approximately 2\% of the
   general population. Among those most affected are young people
   participating in sport activities. Athletes involved in overhead sports,
   such as tennis, weight lifting, volleyball and throwing sports are
   especially predisposed to developing posterior instability of the
   shoulder. Men are affected three times more often than women. Compared
   to the much more common anterior instability, posterior instability with
   a prevalence of 2-10\% of all shoulder instabilities, is often
   overlooked and therefore incorrectly treated. Reports in the literature
   have recently become more frequent and the prevalence is increasing.
   Aim of the work. This aim of this review article is to highlight the
   current topic of posterior shoulder instability and increase awareness
   concerning the diagnostics and therapy.
   Material and Methods. By means of the search machine
   http://www-ncbi-nlm-nih.ez54.periodicos.capes.gov.br, reviews and recent studies on posterior
   instability of the shoulder were identified using the keywords shoulder,
   posterior and instability.
   Results and Discussion. With a prevalence of 2-10\% of all shoulder
   instabilities, posterior shoulder instability is often overlooked and
   therefore incorrectly treated. The cause in most cases is unnoticed
   microtrauma. Pain during certain movements is often the main symptom and
   instability is perceived only as a secondary symptom. For small or no
   bony defects arthroscopic posterior labral repair provides excellent
   results. For bony operations the extent of a reverse Hill-Sachs lesion
   defect is primarily decisive.}},

   Euro Heart Survey program. For the present analysis, patients
   experiencing CP during PCI (n = 124, 0.3\%) were compared with those who
   underwent PCI without CP. Patients with CP were older, more often women,
   had more severe coronary disease, and underwent more complex types of
   coronary intervention. Independent factors associated with CP were the
   use of rotablation, intravascular ultrasound-guided PCI, bypass PCI, a
   totally occluded vessel, a type C lesion, peripheral arterial disease,
   and body mass index <25. More than 10\% of the patients developed
   cardiac tamponade. In a small minority (3.3\%), emergency bypass surgery
   had to be performed. The inhospital death rate was markedly elevated in
   patients with CP (7.3\% vs 1.5\%, p < 0.001). After adjustment for the
   Euro Heart score, CP remained a strong predictor of hospital mortality
   (odds ratio 5.21, 95\% confidence interval 2.34 to 11.60). In
   conclusion, in this real world, all-comers registry, the incidence of CP
   was low, occurred more often in patients who underwent more complex
   coronary interventions, and was associated with a fivefold higher
   hospital mortality. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Repair of mutagen-induced DNA lesions during transportation, storage and
   cultivation of lymphocytes may have a significant impact on results
   obtained in human biomonitoring after occupational and environmental
   exposure of human populations to genotoxic chemicals. Using the comet
   assay in combination with the repair inhibitor aphidicolin and array
   gene expression analysis of 92 DNA repair genes, we investigated the
   repair of DNA lesions induced by methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and
   benzo{[}a] pyrenediolepoxide (BPDE) in phytohaemagglutinin
   (PHA)-stimulated cultured human lymphocytes in the time segment before
   replication. The comet assay indicated fast repair of MMS-induced damage
   during the first hours of cultivation. In contrast, removal of
   BPDE-induced lesions was slower and significant amounts of damage seem
   to persist until S-phase. Gene expression analysis revealed that PHA
   stimulation had a clear effect on gene regulation in lymphocytes already
   during the first 18 h of cultivation. Under the conditions of this
   study, genotoxic concentrations of MMS did not induce significant
   changes in gene expression. In contrast, exposure to BPDE led to altered
   expression of several genes in a time-and concentration-related manner.
   Of the significantly up-regulated genes, only two genes (XPA and XPC)
   were directly related to nucleotide excision repair. Our results suggest
   that PHA stimulation of human lymphocytes influences the expression of
   DNA repair genes in human lymphocytes. The effect of induced DNA damage
   on gene expression is comparatively low and depends on the mutagens
   used. PHA-stimulated lymphocytes repair induced DNA damage before they
   start to replicate but the repair activity during the first 18 h of
   cultivation is not affected by changes in the expression of DNA repair
   genes during this period of time.}},

Abstract = {{This article depicts the landscape of teacher professional development
   (PD) in Singapore, one of the world's top-performing countries in
   education. We provide an overview of the resources available to the
   approximately 30,000 teachers within the 350 primary and secondary
   schools run by the Ministry of Education (MOE). We focus on the three
   main PD providers: the National Institute of Education, the Academy of
   Singapore Teachers and six Centers of Excellence, and schools
   themselves. Guided by the ``Teacher Growth Model,{''}these providers aim
   at making PD coherent with teachers' interests, the needs of schools,
   and the national curriculum. Teachers in Singapore are given the
   exceptionally high allotment of 100 voluntary hours of PD per year.
   There are multiple types of activities teachers can engage in, ranging
   from formal/structured courses and programs to more
   informal/reform-based initiatives (action research, lesson study).
   Teachers with different levels of expertise and career paths have access
   to different PD opportunities. Most PD is subject-specific and provides
   teachers with opportunities for networked learning, collegial sharing,
   and collaboration. In fact, all MOE schools have been recently mandated
   to become Professional Learning Communities (PLC). We conclude that this
   comprehensive set of PD resources, considered as a whole, presents the
   features of ``high-quality{''} PD described in the international
   literature. However, we suggest that more research is needed to examine
   the extent to which such an ambitious PD model is enhancing teachers'
   knowledge and pedagogies, and ultimately students' learning.}},

Abstract = {{Aggression is a central trait affecting fitness, which has been well
   studied in many animals. As a part of a research programme integrating
   mechanisms and fitness consequences of aggression, we examined the
   adaptive functions of antagonistic interactions in fruit flies,
   Drosophila melanogaster, a species in which aggression has been studied
   primarily in the context of territorial behaviour. In our experiments,
   males at an attractive food patch were more aggressive towards other
   males when they were in the presence of their recent mates than when
   they were in the presence of females mated with other males.
   Furthermore, while recently mated males accompanied by their mates were
   more aggressive than virgin males, recently mated males and virgin males
   showed similar levels of aggression in the presence of females mated
   with other males. When we allowed focal males to mate inside
   experimental arenas and then added intruder males, the intruder males
   spent less time on the food patch, remated with the resident females at
   lower frequencies and fathered a smaller proportion of offspring when
   the focals males remained in the arenas than when we removed the focal
   males. Our results reveal a novel adaptive function of aggression in
   fruit flies: in addition to fighting to defend attractive food sources
   that attract prospective mates, males rely on aggression to guard their
   mates, and such mate guarding enhances their fitness. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{Cotton textile and clothing industry is a complex and multi-tiered
   system that consists of cotton cultivation and harvesting, fiber
   production, yarn manufacturing, fabric preparation, fabric processing
   that includes bleaching and dying sub-processes among others and
   fabrication of the final product. An array of environmental concerns are
   associated with this sector, the most significant of which are issues
   related to use of agrochemicals in the cultivation of cotton and water,
   energy and chemical consumption in the fabric processing stage. Textile
   industry is a significant contributor to the Turkish economy
   constituting 18\% of total export volume in 2013 according to Turkish
   Statistical Institute. In the study, environmental impacts of Eco
   T-shirts produced from organically grown cotton and processed with green
   dyeing recipe were compared to that of conventional T-shirts, in terms
   of their contributions to global warming, acidification, aquatic and
   terrestrial eutrophication and photochemical ozone formation using life
   cycle assessment methodology. The results reveal that Eco T-shirts have
   lower impact potentials across all inspected categories, with the most
   dramatic reduction in aquatic eutrophication potential (up to 97\%) due
   to elimination of nitrogen and phosphorus containing chemical based
   fertilizers. The results also show that global warming potential is by
   far the largest environmental impact for both conventional and Eco
   T-shirts with the main impact coming from use phase, followed by
   cultivation and harvesting and fabric processing phases. The results of
   the analysis underline the importance of utilizing sustainable raw
   materials in all life cycle stages of cotton textile products and the
   necessity of focusing on the consumer behavior and sustainable practices
   in the use phase of the products as well. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We have created models to predict cleavage sites for several human
   proteases including caspase-1, caspase-3, caspase-6, caspase-7,
   cathepsin B, cathepsin D, cathepsin G, cathepsin K, cathepsin L,
   elastase-2, granzyme A, granzyme B, matrix metallopeptidase-2 (MMP2),
   MMP7, MMP9, thrombin, and trypsin-1. Rather than representing the
   sequence pattern around the potential cleavage site through a series of
   flags with each flag representing one of the 20 standard amino acids, we
   first represent each amino acid by its calculated properties. For these
   calculated properties, we use validated cheminformatic descriptors, such
   as molecular weight, logP, and polar surface area, of the individual
   amino acids. Finally, the cleavage site-specific descriptors are
   calculated through various combinations of the individual amino acid
   descriptors for the residues surrounding the cleavage site. Some of
   these combinations do not take into account the location of the residue,
   as long as it is in a prescribed neighborhood of the potential cleavage
   site, whereas others are sensitive to the precise order of the residues
   in the sequence. The key advantage of this approach is that it allows
   one to perform meaningful calculations with nonstandard amino acids for
   which little or no data exists. Finally, using both docking and
   molecular dynamics simulations, we examine the potential for and
   limitations of protease crystal structures to impact the design of
   proteolytically stable peptides. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Abstract = {{For the first time there were established the regularities of copper
   dissolution in an aqueous solution of potassium bromide. The
   electrochemical behavior of copper in the solution of potassium bromide
   was studied by removal of cyclic and anodic potentiodynamic polarization
   curves. The effect of the potential sweep rate and temperature of the
   electrolyte were investigated in the process of oxidation of copper.
   It was found that by the increasing of anodic potential sweep rate
   within the 25-200 mV/ s on polarograms were increased value of the
   maximum current of the oxidation of copper and a shift of the maximum
   value of the potential in the anode region. It is shown that with
   increasing temperature of the electrolyte from 25 to 65 degrees C on
   polarization curves as well increase in the anodic current maximum
   oxidation of copper was observed. From the temperature dependence of
   solution and the logarithm of the current there was calculated the
   effective activation energy of the anodic reaction and it is equal to
   2.86 kJ / mol, and it allows to assume that the anodic oxidation of the
   copper in the solution of potassium bromide takes place in the diffusion
   regime.
   It is found that the electrode reactions which take place at the copper
   electrode in a solution of potassium bromide proceed by a complex
   mechanism and shows that the anodic polarization copper is oxidized with
   a formation of monovalent and divalent copper ions. For the first time
   it was suggested that the surface of the copper electrode is formed by
   copper (I) bromide.}},

Abstract = {{Osmotic fragility test has been used to study the influence of different
   factors on the osmotic properties of cell membranes. Considering the
   importance of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in biological functions
   we aimed to investigate the effects of dietary PUFA supplementation on
   erythrocyte osmotic fragility (EOF), blood lactate (BL), hematocrit
   (Hct), red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin (Hb), and mean cell volume (MCV)
   in 10 jumper horses. Two events occurred prior to start supplementing
   horse's diet and two events occurred after 4 weeks PUFA supplementation.
   Five horses received the PUFA supplementation (Group A), and five served
   as controls (Group B). Blood samples were taken before and after each
   course. The statistical analysis revealed significant increase in BL,
   Hct, RBC and Hb following exercise (P < 0.0001). However, the
   interaction between exercise and PUFA supplementation (P=0.0083) showed
   PUFA-supplemented horses having a smaller rise in BL levels (P=0.0107)
   following exercise. Significant interactions between exercise and PUFA
   treatment were also found on EOF levels (P < 0.05). The hemolysis curves
   showed PUFA-supplemented horses exhibiting a reduction in EOF compared
   to controls (P < 0.05). Although hemolysis never occurred at 0.9\% NaCl
   concentration, jumping exercise determined an increase in EOF (P=0.0014)
   at 0.8\% NaCl solution. A significant interaction between exercise and
   PUFA treatment (P=0.0022) was found showing PUFA-supplemented horses
   having lower EOF (P=0.0015) following exercise. The assessment of EOF is
   a suitable indicator of athletic performance. The results showed that
   PUFA supplementation might exert beneficial effects on the horse body
   system by enhancing the performance in high-level show jumpers. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new method for thermal imaging of hydroelectric
   generators stators. The method is based on distributed temperature
   optical fiber sensing using Raman scattering. The thermal image is
   generated by combining the information of temperature and the spatial
   position of the sensor with the 3-D model of the structure. Regarding
   the use of conventional sensors, such as resistance temperature detector
   or PT100, the main advantage is the possibility to identify temperature
   variations over the entire stator surface. The results were obtained
   over a 22-h test with a 200-MW hydroelectric generator. The produced
   thermal images showed a great potential for monitoring the temperature
   distribution in the stator according to the generator load. The new
   method can contribute for identification of fault in the structure
   insulation, which when early identified can reduce damage caused by
   short circuit in the stator windings.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the application of the indexical field (Eckert, 2008) and
   orders of indexicality (Silverstein, 2003) for the Brazilian Portuguese
   (BP) term favelado `slum-dweller', which is synonymous to morador de
   favela `slum-dweller' but has acquired negatively charged indexical
   values. Building on discussions of the (re)appropriation or reclaiming
   of slurs and other pejorized terms, such as the Cantonese word tongzhi
   (Wong, 2005, 2008), gay (McConnell-Ginet, 2002), queer (McConnell-Ginet,
   2002), nigger (Jacobs, 2002; Camp, 2013; Croom, 2011; Washington, 2010;
   inter alia), this study of favelado builds on Eckert's (2008) indexical
   field and creates a model of lexical indexicality that explains the
   simultaneous availability of both pejorative and powerful meanings. The
   positively-valenced reclaimed meanings are contextually limited and
   require simultaneous access to pejorative meanings. We propose that
   movement, or `sidestepping' (Eckert, 2008), within the indexical field
   fuels movement between pejorative and ameliorated meanings. This paper
   highlights the importance of accounting for lexical indexical values in
   sociolinguistic study. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recreational and professional clam fishing was an important activity on
   the extensive intertidal zone of the western Cotentin coast (western
   English Channel). A variety of fishing gear was used to harvest the
   target species: the European clam Ruditapes decussatus (Linnaeus, 1758)
   and the introduced Manila clam R. philippinarum (Adams and Reeve, 1850).
   In this study, we studied the effect of rake harvesting during the
   spring tides of February-March 2014, following an experimental design
   with a control station and three stations impacted by rake harvesting in
   three sediment types: sandy, gravelly, and mixed gravelly rocky
   habitats. No significant sediment and macrofauna changes occurred at the
   three sites after rake harvesting. Nevertheless, the number of clams
   decreased significantly after raking on the gravelly habitat, whereas in
   the other two habitats, sediment transport in this high-energy
   hydrodynamic environment was able to transfer clams and other macrofauna
   species across the fishing sites, thus minimizing the effects of rake
   harvesting. Therefore, although the effect of rake harvesting appeared
   limited during winter, the regional impact (high fishing pressure along
   60 km of coast) and increase of recreational fishers during summer
   needed to be studied in the future.}},

Abstract = {{The birth prevalence of limb deficiencies in Alberta has been
   fluctuating. The objectives were to examine patterns and temporal trends
   of congenital limb deficiencies in Alberta and compare rates with those
   of other jurisdictions. The Alberta Congenital Anomalies Surveillance
   System data on live births, stillbirths, and terminations of pregnancy
   (<20 weeks gestation) occurring between 1980 through 2012 with the
   ICD-10 Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health Adaptations codes
   Q71-Q73 (limb reduction defects), Q79.80 (congenital constriction
   bands), and Q87.24 (sirenomelia syndrome) were reviewed. Cases were
   classified as having amelia, transverse, longitudinal (preaxial,
   postaxial, central, or mixed), intercalary, split hand/split foot,
   complex, or other type of limb deficiency. Phenotypes were classified as
   associated, which included cases with a known etiology and cases with at
   least one other type of anomaly, or isolated. From 1980 through 2012,
   795 cases were ascertained from 1,411,652 live births and stillbirths,
   giving a prevalence of 5.6/10,000 total births. Mixed longitudinal
   deficiencies were the most common (22.4\%). The upper limbs (63.9\%)
   were affected more often than the lower limbs (25.3\%). Isolated limb
   deficiencies occurred in 43.6\% of cases, 28.4\% had Mendelian or other
   known conditions, 21.9\% had multiple congenital anomalies, 5.4\% had
   chromosome abnormalities and 0.6\% were due to teratogens. The
   associated group, showed a significant increasing trend (P= 0.023).
   While the overall limb deficiency rates show very little differences
   across diverse populations and differing time periods, comparisons of
   subgroups should be made with caution, because variations in terminology
   and classification contribute to reported differences. (c) 2015 Wiley

Abstract = {{Drug dependence may be at its core a pathology of choice, defined by
   continued decisions to use drugs irrespective of negative consequences.
   Despite evidence of dysregulated decision making in addiction, little is
   known about the neural processes underlying the most clinically relevant
   decisions drug users make: decisions to use drugs. Here, we combined
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), machine learning, and
   human laboratory drug administration to investigate neural activation
   underlying decisions to smoke cannabis. Nontreatment-seeking daily
   cannabis smokers completed an fMRI choice task, making repeated
   decisions to purchase or decline 1-12 placebo or active cannabis `puffs'
   (\$0.25-\$5/puff). One randomly selected decision was implemented. If
   the selected choice had been bought, the cost was deducted from study
   earnings and the purchased cannabis smoked in the laboratory;
   alternatively, the participant remained in the laboratory without
   cannabis. Machine learning with leave-one-subject-out cross-validation
   identified distributed neural activation patterns discriminating
   decisions to buy cannabis from declined offers. A total of 21
   participants were included in behavioral analyses; 17 purchased cannabis
   and were thus included in fMRI analyses. Purchasing varied lawfully with
   dose and cost. The classifier discriminated with 100\% accuracy between
   fMRI activation patterns for purchased vs declined cannabis at the level
   of the individual. Dorsal striatum, insula, posterior parietal regions,
   anterior and posterior cingulate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex all
   contributed reliably to this neural signature of decisions to smoke
   cannabis. These findings provide the basis for a brain-based
   characterization of drug-related decision making in drug abuse,
   including effects of psychological and pharmacological interventions on
   these processes.}},

Abstract = {{Given the severity of their illness and lack of effective
   disease-modifying agents, it is not surprising that most patients with
   amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) consider trying complementary and
   alternative therapies. Some of the most commonly considered alternative
   therapies include special diets, nutritional supplements, cannabis,
   acupuncture, chelation, and energy healing. This article reviews these
   in detail. The authors also describe 3 models by which physicians may
   frame discussions about alternative therapies: paternalism, autonomy,
   and shared decision making. Finally, the authors review a program called
   ALSUntangled, which uses shared decision making to review alternative
   therapies for ALS.}},

Abstract = {{The Pb-210 radiometric dating method was applied in order to determine
   the sedimentation rates of a northern Danube Delta lake (Merhei Lake)
   using alpha and gamma spectrometry for assessing the radionuclides of
   interest Another objective is to measure the geochronology of each
   sediment layer and to determine the dynamics of the characteristic
   sedimentation processes. The Danube Delta is the second largest river
   delta in Europe, having an approximate surface of 4152 km(2). The Danube
   branches into three main distributaries into the delta: Chilia, Sulina
   and Sfantul Gheorghe. Two sediment cores (one from the close proximity
   of the estuary and another one from a more secluded area) were taken
   from a northern lake, namely Merhei Lake, formed between the Chilia and
   Sulina branches. The sedimentation rate was measured by Pb-210 using its
   a emitting progeny, Po-210, for determining the solid discharge of the
   delta branches and, respectively, the spacial and temporal variations;
   while Ra-226 (determining the supported and unsupported Pb-210 content
   of the sediments) was determined using high resolution gamma
   spectrometry. The sediments have been dated up to 1885, having average
   mass sedimentation rates of 0.30 +/- 0.04 g/cm(2)y and linear
   sedimentation rates of 0.68 +/- 0.18 cm/y. The sediment is transported
   throughout the lake, so the more secluded part of the lake has at some
   depths up to twenty times more sediment intake than the one near the
   estuary.}},

Abstract = {{The incidence of anterior cruciate ligament injuries is considerably
   higher in females than in males and the underlying mechanisms are still
   under debate. Research indicates that the neuromuscular system of
   females and males might respond differently to the same fatigue protocol
   due to differences in muscle activation during movement tasks. This
   study analyzed sex differences in hamstring reflex responses and
   posterior-anterior tibial translation (TT) before and after fatiguing
   exercise. We measured the isolated movement of the tibia relative to the
   femur as a consequence of mechanically induced TT in standing subjects
   as well as muscle activity of the hamstrings before and after repetitive
   jumping and sprinting until exhaustion. Muscle fatigue delayed reflex
   onset latencies in females and males. A reduction in reflex responses
   associated with an increased TT was observed after fatiguing exercise
   for both sexes. Data indicate that the used fatigue protocol altered the
   latency and magnitude of reflex responses as well as TT in females and
   males. Based on the results of previous research and the outcome of this
   study, it might be that sex-specific effects of fatigue on reflex
   activity and mechanical stability of the knee depend on the kind of
   fatiguing exercise. (c) 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society. Published by

   On the basis of the relevant literature this article a) characterizes
   the universal alterations in body perception and body representation in
   chronic pain, b) describes the potential mechanisms underlying mirror
   therapy and c) discusses the chances of success of mirror therapy for
   the treatment of inflammatory rheumatic pain.
   Literature search on the effectiveness and mechanisms of mirror therapy
   and derived procedures for the potential treatment of pain in
   inflammatory rheumatic disorders.
   There is evidence that mirror therapy can alleviate chronic pain
   experiences by correcting the accompanying distorted body perception as
   well as body representation by multimodal sensory stimulation. As there
   is probably a similar distortion in persons with chronic pain related to
   inflammatory rheumatic disorders, mirror therapy might also have
   positive effects in this field; however, the accompanying
   characteristics of these disorders, such as motor impairment and
   motor-evoked pain, may complicate the implementation of this kind of
   treatment.
   Mirror therapy represents an intervention with few side effects and
   might have positive effects on the experience of chronic pain in
   patients with inflammatory rheumatic disorders. Further clinical
   research is required in order to evaluate the potential of mirror
   therapy and associated interventional methods for the treatment of

Abstract = {{Information on the extent, location and condition of semi-natural
   habitats is essential to deliver the national targets to achieve the UK
   commitment to Biodiversity 2020 (Defra, 2011). This strategy aims to
   halt overall biodiversity loss by 2020 and move towards a position of
   net gain. In order to achieve this, both local and national bodies need
   detailed information on the habitats present over their entire area.
   Remote sensing provides opportunities for cost-effective, rapid and
   repeatable habitat mapping. This paper presents a method used to produce
   a seamless habitat map of the county of Norfolk, UK, of sufficient
   detail to inform land management decisions. Key aspects of the method
   were the development of parallel classification systems using different
   input data combinations and a long-term, volunteer-based map validation
   and update procedure. The habitat classification method utilised
   multiple earth observation platforms characterised by differences in
   spatial resolution, spectral range and season of image capture. The
   combinations of image data used were very important for the success of
   the analyses. The classification process was guided by ecological
   principles and local knowledge, along with targeted ground-truthing to
   guide class associations, confirm underlying ecological processes and to
   assess accuracy, and map revision.
   The study found that automated methods of analysis were most effective
   when classifying habitats characterised by distinctive dominant cover
   species, or groups of dominant species. The methods were least effective
   at identifying habitats defined by the presence of low growth-form
   species at low frequency or where they form understorey vegetation; in
   such cases field checking is vital to confirm the habitat class
   assignment. This scale of mapping can be used in combination with
   targeted, sustainable field survey effort to provide the level of
   information needed by decision makers to support Biodviersity 2020
   targets and a wide range of other policy needs. The map has already been
   adopted by a wide range of organisations and finding application in such
   areas as Green Infrastructure, Living Landscape and habitat suitability
   modelling. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   orientation to DBT phone coaching: (a) orientation to the three
   functions of DBT telephone coaching; (b) orientation to the rationale of
   the 24-hour rule; (c) orientation to the logistics of contacting their
   therapist after hours; (d) orientation to observing the therapist's
   personal limits; (e) orientation to the purpose of phone holidays; and
   (f) orientation to the practice of using skills prior to calling. A
   video is provided to further elucidate how to orient clients to DBT
   telephone coaching}},

Abstract = {{Large scale grids permit to share grid resources spread over different
   autonomous administrative sites in the internet. The rapid progress of
   grid systems opens the door for numerous companies to adopt this
   technology in their business development. This progress is characterized
   by the increasing openness and opportunity of resource-sharing across
   organizations in different domains. In the business context, these
   shared resources can be misused by some malicious users that can abuse
   the provided resources and make them behave maliciously to return wrong
   results and sabotage the jobs execution. The common technique used by
   most grid systems to deal with this problem is based on replication with
   voting. Nevertheless, these techniques rely on the assumption that the
   grid resources behave independently. They may be ineffective where a
   number of collusive resources collectively return the same wrong results
   of a job execution. In order to overcome this threat, we propose a
   reputation-based voting (RBV) approach, which investigates the
   trustworthiness of the grid resources through a reputation system, and
   then takes a decision about the results. In addition, the performance of
   our approach and other voting techniques, like m-first voting and
   credibility-based voting, are evaluated through simulation to perceive
   the effect of collusive grid resources on the correctness of the
   results. The obtained results show that our approach achieves a lower
   error-rate and better performance in terms of overhead.}},

Abstract = {{The efficacy of sublingual artemether (ArTiMist) was investigated in two
   studies. In study 1, 31 children were randomized to sublingual
   artemether (n = 16) or intravenous (i.v.) quinine (n = 15). In study 2,
   151 children were randomized to sublingual artemether (n = 77) or i.v.
   quinine (n = 74). For both studies, patients weighed between 5 and 15 kg
   and had either severe or complicated malaria based on WHO criteria, or
   they had uncomplicated malaria but were unable to tolerate oral
   medication as a result of nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Patients
   received either 3 mg/kg of body weight of sublingual artemether or a
   loading dose of 20 mg/kg of i.v. quinine followed by 10 mg/kg every 8 h
   i.v. thereafter. The primary endpoint was parasitological success,
   defined as a reduction in parasite count of >= 90\% of that at baseline
   at 24 h after the first dose. Other endpoints based on parasite
   clearance and clinical response were evaluated. In study 1, there were
   parasitological success rates of 93.3\% (14/15) and 66.7\% (10/15) for
   the sublingual artemether and quinine treatments, respectively. In study
   2, 94.3\% (66/70) of the ArTiMist-treated patients and 39.4\% (28/71) of
   the quinine-treated patients had parasitological success (P < 0.0001).
   Indicators of parasite clearance (parasite clearance time {[}PCT], time
   for parasite count to fall by 50\% {[}PCT50], time for parasite count to
   fall by 90\% {[}PCT90], and percent reduction in parasitemia from
   baseline at 24 h {[}PRR24]) were significantly superior for children
   treated with sublingual artemether compared to those treated with i.v.
   quinine. There were no differences between treatments for the clinical
   endpoints, such as fever clearance time. The local tolerability of
   sublingual artemether was good. Sublingual artemether leads to rapid
   parasite clearance and clinical recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. There are no French guidelines for the management of
   complicated parapneumonic effusions. A national observational study was
   carried out to assess the main features of current clinical practice for
   this condition.
   Material and methods. A questionnaire was sent by email to the 1500
   members of the Societe de Pneumologie de Langue Francaise (SPLF) between
   15th November and 15th December 2012.
   Results. There were 92 responders, i.e. a response rate of 6\%. Of
   these, 87 physicians mentioned that they were involved in the management
   of patients with complicated parapneumonic effusions with a median
   number of cases of 10 per year (IQR: 5-20). Chest tube drainage was the
   main approach used for pleural fluid aspiration (n=51/87), followed by
   repeated thoracentesis (n =29/87) and early surgery (1/87). Five
   physicians answered both chest tube drainage or repeated thoracentesis
   and one physician either chest tube drainage or early surgery. Pleural
   fibrinolytics were never used by 20\% of physicians, only in case of
   loculations by 70\% and by 10\% of respondents in all cases. Only 3
   physicians combined fibrinolytics with DNAse. A double antibiotic dose
   was used by one third of physicians. All the physicians used respiratory
   physiotherapy during hospitalization and to aid recovery. Follow-up
   practices were heterogeneous.
   Conclusions. The management of complicated parapneumonic effusions
   varies significantly in France. National guidelines may be helpful to
   define best practice and aid in its implementation. (C) 2015 SPLF.

Abstract = {{One approach to compensating for rapid climate change and protecting
   biodiversity is assisted migration (AM) of key tree species. However,
   tools for evaluating the sensitivity of target sites and identifying
   potential sources have not yet been developed. We used the National
   Forest Inventories of Spain and France to design scenarios for AM
   between and within both countries. We characterized sensitivity to
   climate change as the expected changes in volume and mortality of Pinus
   halepensis Miller and Pinus pinaster Aiton between the present and 2050.
   Target zones were selected from provenances with high sensitivity and
   seed zones from provenances with low sensitivity to climate change; the
   latter can be considered ``seed refugia{''} as the climate changes.
   Three plausible scenarios for translocation to the target zone were
   developed on the basis of volume simulations calibrated with different
   planting strategies: (1) seeds only from foreign provenances; (2)
   foreign provenances plus local seeds; and (3) only local seeds. The
   results for both species show that models based on foreign
   ``top-three{''} provenances always increased the standing volume of the
   target zone. Models run with only local seeds predicted increased volume
   for P. halepensis but not for P. pinaster. Our results suggest that
   volume and mortality trends are not always correlated with seed sources
   and targets, that projected provenances mortality do not follow always a
   southern-northern pattern and that seed refugia, if any, may be useful
   for compensating for the effects of climate change only in a subset of
   provenances.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we want to understand the Proudman resonance. It is a
   resonant respond in shallow waters of a water body on a traveling
   atmospheric disturbance when the speed of the disturbance is close to
   the typical water wave velocity. We show here that the same kind of
   resonance exists for landslide tsunamis and we propose a mathematical
   approach to investigate these phenomena based on the derivation,
   justification and analysis of relevant asymptotic models. This approach
   allows us to investigate more complex phenomena that are not dealt with
   in the physics literature such as the influence of a variable bottom or
   the generalization of the Proudman resonance in deeper waters. First, we
   prove a local well-posedness of the water waves equations with a moving
   bottom and a non constant pressure at the surface taking into account
   the dependence of small physical parameters and we show that these
   equations are a Hamiltonian system (which extends the result of Zakharov
   (1968 J. Appl. Mech. Tech. Phys. 9 190-4)). Then, we justify some linear
   asymptotic models in order to study the Proudman resonance and submarine
   landslide tsunamis; we study the linear water waves equations and
   dispersion estimates allow us to investigate the amplitude of the sea
   level. To complete these asymptotic models, we add some numerical
   simulations.}},

Abstract = {{We use a unique dataset from a sample of 85 French firms over the period
   2002-2008 in order to answer the following questions: Is there any
   relation between the use of auditors with a brand-name reputation for
   providing high-quality audit reports and the number of related-party
   transactions (RPTs) reported to outside shareholders? And, how does a
   more transparent environment for the reporting of related-party
   transactions affect this relationship, if at all? We find that firms
   audited by Big 4 auditors report fewer related-party transactions. The
   period under study includes the change in accounting standards in Europe
   that occurred in 2005 with the adoption of IFRS standards, which
   resulted in a more transparent reporting environment for RPTs. We find
   that the negative relationship between auditor reputation and the number
   of reported of RPTs is ``weaker'' in a more transparent reporting
   environment. We argue that these results are related to the accounting
   uncertainty surrounding the reporting of related-party transactions that
   particularly affects the behavior of Big 4 auditors.}},

Abstract = {{When reminded of the impending end to their athletic career, it may
   benefit athletes to prioritize other identities and goals that will be
   more important in the future. However, by applying a general process
   model of psychological threat and defense (Jonas et al., 2014), we
   conducted 2 studies to test the idea that individuals may actually
   report stronger identification as an athlete to counter goal-discrepant
   perceptions aroused by a sport career threat. Both studies used a
   between-subjects design, where participants were assigned to a condition
   in which they either envisioned the end of their athletic career, a
   control condition, their own mortality (i.e., a universal
   goal-discrepant threat, Study 1 only), or the end of their student
   career (Study 2 only). In Study 1, with a sample of interuniversity
   sport athletes (n = 81), participants in the universal goal-discrepant
   threat and the end of athletic career threat conditions reported greater
   identification as an athlete relative to a control condition. Study 2 (n
   = 85) replicated these findings, and also revealed that reflecting on
   the end of their athletic career elicited a distinct pattern of
   identification when contrasted with a condition where participants
   imagined the end of their student career. These studies provide novel
   evidence of how a mere reminder about the end of an athletic career can
   influence athletic identity exclusivity. Consistent with theories of
   psychological threat and defense, university sport participants may turn
   toward their athletic identity as a way to counter goal-discrepant
   thoughts.}},

Title = {{Using Agent-Based Modeling for Water Resources Planning and Management}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Agent-based systems have been developed for many scientific applications
   and simulation studies to model a group of actors and their interactions
   based on behavioral rules. Agent-based models and multiagent systems
   simulate the emergence of system-level properties based on the actions
   of adaptive agents that interact with other agents, react to
   environmental signals, and optimize decisions to achieve individual
   goals. In water resources planning and management, agent-based modeling
   has been applied to explore, simulate, and predict the performance of
   infrastructure design and policy decisions as they are influenced by
   human decision making, behaviors, and adaptations. The goal of this
   paper is to provide a comprehensive introduction to agent-based modeling
   for water resources researchers, students, and practitioners, and to
   explore water resources systems as complex adaptive systems that can be
   studied using agent-based modeling. Agent-based modeling is defined, and
   the characteristics of complex adaptive systems that necessitate its use
   are described. A literature review is presented to demonstrate research
   in the field that uses agent-based modeling to gain insight for water
   resources management. Two illustrative case studies of agent-based water
   resources systems models are developed and described. The case studies
   demonstrate the use of reactive and active (e.g., optimizing) agents for
   simulating water resources planning problems. The limitations in
   applying agent-based modeling and the insights that are expected from
   further investigations are summarized. (C) 2015 American Society of

Abstract = {{Comprehensive emergency obstetric care including major surgery such as
   caesarean section is a major health system problem in rural areas of
   poor countries, where there are no doctors. Innovative trainings of
   mid-level workforce have now demonstrated viable, scientifically valid
   solutions. Delegation of major surgery to duly trained `non-physician
   clinicians' `task shifting' should be seriously considered to address
   the human resources crisis in poor countries to cope with current
   challenges to enhance maternal and neonatal survival.
   Nationwide, non-physician clinicians in Mozambique perform approximately
   90\% of caesarean sections at the district hospital level. A comparison
   between the outcomes of caesarean sections provided by this category and
   medical doctors, respectively, demonstrates no clinically significant
   differences. These mid-level providers have a remarkably high retention
   rate in rural areas (close to 90\%). They are cost-effective, as their
   training and deployment is three times more cost-effective than that of
   medical doctors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{4085-4095}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Peptide splicing, in which two distant parts of a protein are excised
   and then ligated to form a novel peptide, can generate unique MHC class
   I-restricted responses. Because these peptides are not genetically
   encoded and the rules behind proteasomal splicing are unknown, it is
   difficult to predict these spliced Ags. In the current study, small
   libraries of short peptides were used to identify amino acid sequences
   that affect the efficiency of this transpeptidation process. We observed
   that splicing does not occur at random, neither in terms of the amino
   acid sequences nor through random splicing of peptides from different
   sources. In contrast, splicing followed distinct rules that we deduced
   and validated both in vitro and in cells. Peptide ligation was
   quantified using a model peptide and demonstrated to occur with up to
   30\% ligation efficiency in vitro, provided that optimal structural
   requirements for ligation were met by both ligating partners. In
   addition, many splicing products could be formed from a single protein.
   Our splicing rules will facilitate prediction and detection of new
   spliced Ags to expand the peptidome presented by MHC class I Ags.}},

Volume = {{60}},

Abstract = {{Gassing in batteries is a major issue contributing to capacity fading
   upon cycling, and thus far, differential electrochemical mass
   spectrometry (DEMS) has been a suitable analytical tool to investigate
   such gas evolution reactions. However, the identity of molecules is
   ambiguous knowing only the m/zvalue(s) and quantification is
   complicated. Therefore, the setup of a novel technique for in situ gas
   analysis of operating lithium-ion batteries is introduced, namely, DEMS
   combined with infrared spectroscopy. In a ``long-term{''} study of a
   Li1+xNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM 523)/graphite cell being close to technical
   conditions, we monitor the CO2 evolution over more than twenty cycles
   and show the dependence of the amount of generated CO2 on the charge
   cut-off potential. Furthermore, we deconvolute the MS channel m/z = 28
   and show, for the first time, the direct observation of its constituent
   gases. Other gaseous decomposition products (like CO2 here) can be
   determined unambiguously as well through both their m/z values and their
   characteristic IR absorptions, but are not discussed here. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Seasonal reproduction of the climbing perch Anabas testudineus in the
   Candaba wetland, Philippines, is described. Monthly specimens were
   collected, gonads and viscera excised, and the gonads histologically
   examined. Low mean female gonadosomatic index {[}GSI (\%)] from
   September to February (0.3-2.1 \%) increased in March (8.7 \%), peaked
   in May (10.9 \%), and declined in June (3.3 \%), but increased again in
   July and August (8.3-5.5 \%). Male GSIs (at least 1 \%) were low from
   September until May, increased in June (2.5 \%), and then declined
   thereafter. All the six oocyte and four spermatogenic cell development
   stages were observed in the gonads throughout the annual cycle. The
   ovary was dominated by primary growth oocytes (chromatin nucleolus,
   perinucleolus) from August to February (77-90 \%), but yolky oocytes
   (previtellogenic, vitellogenic) comprised 15 \% to 28 \% of the ovary
   from March to July. Mature oocytes were present for most of the year,
   comprising 40 \% of the total oocytes in March-April, peaking in May (50
   \%), but declining to 30 \% in June-July. Spermatozoa consistently
   dominated the testis throughout the annual cycle, particularly in
   November and March (58 \%). Food intake in both sexes was generally low
   during the dry season (December-April) when gonad activity was also low,
   but started to increase at the onset of the wet season (May-November)
   when gonad activity began to peak. These results demonstrate that the
   climbing perch gonads exhibit asynchronous development, allowing a
   protracted breeding season with intense gonad activity timed at the
   onset of the wet season, concurrent with increasing food intake through
   the rest of the season.}},

   Our objective was to gather the information and documentary tools that

   reports referenced on MEDLINE describe 79 medications pharmacokinetics
   after gastrointestinal surgery. Four are not available in France. Six
   literature reviews were found. Four summaries of product characteristics
   provided information related to drug absorption. No documentary tool

Abstract = {{IntroductionThe surgical treatment of comorbid erectile dysfunction and
   Peyronie's disease has long included the implantation of an inflatable
   penile prosthesis as well as a number of adjuvant maneuvers to address
   residual curvature after prosthesis placement.
   AimTo review the various surgical options for addressing curvature after
   prosthesis placement, with specific attention paid to an original
   article by Wilson etal. reporting on modeling over a penile prosthesis
   for the management of Peyronie's disease.
   MethodsA literature review was performed analyzing articles reporting
   the management of penile curvature in patients undergoing implantation
   of an inflatable penile prosthesis.
   Main Outcome MeasuresReported improvement in Peyronie's deformity as
   well as the complication rate associated with the various surgical
   techniques described.
   ResultsModeling is a well-established treatment modality among patients
   with Peyronie's disease undergoing penile prosthesis implantation. A
   variety of other adjuvant maneuvers to address residual curvature when
   modeling alone is insufficient has been presented in the literature.
   ConclusionsOver 20 years of experience with modeling over a penile
   prosthesis have proven the efficacy and safety of this treatment option,
   providing the surgeon a simple initial step for the management of
   residual curvature after penile implantation which allows for the use of
   additional adjuvant maneuvers in those with significant deformities.

Abstract = {{Mapping of Scar-Related VT
   BackgroundSubstrate-based VT ablation is mostly based on maps acquired
   with ablation catheters. We hypothesized that multipolar mapping
   catheters are more effective for identification of scar and local
   abnormal ventricular activity (LAVA).
   Methods and resultsPhase1: In a sheep infarction model (2 months
   postinfarction), substrate mapping and LAVA tagging (CARTO((R))3) was
   performed, using a Navistar (NAV) versus a PentaRay (PR) catheter
   (Biosense Webster). Phase2: Consecutive VT ablation patients from a
   single center underwent NAV versus PR mapping. Point pairs were defined
   as a PR and a NAV point located within a 3D-distance of 3 mm. Agreement
   was defined as both points in a pair being manually tagged as normal or
   LAVA. Four sheep (4 years, 50 4.8 kg) and 9 patients were included (53
   +/- 14 years, 8 male, 6 ischemic cardiomyopathy). Mapping density was
   higher within the scar with PR versus NAV (3.2 vs. 0.7 points/cm(2), P =
   0.001) with larger bipolar scar area (68 +/- 55 cm(2) vs. 58 +/- 48
   cm(2), P = 0.001). In total, 818 point pairs were analyzed. Using PR,
   far-field voltages were smaller (PR vs. NAV; bipolar: 1.43 +/- 1.84 mV
   vs. 1.64 +/- 2.04 mV, P = 0.001; unipolar; 4.28 +/- 3.02 mV vs. 4.59 +/-
   3.67 mV, P < 0.001). More LAVA were also detected with PR (PR vs. NAV;
   126 +/- 113 vs. 36 +/- 29, P = 0.001). When agreement on LAVA was
   reached (overall: 72\%; both LAVA, 40\%; both normal, 82\%) higher LAVA
   voltages were recorded on PR (0.48 +/- 0.33 mV vs. 0.31 +/- 0.21 mV, P =
   0.0001).
   ConclusionMultipolar mapping catheters with small electrodes provide
   more accurate and higher density maps, with a higher sensitivity to
   near-field signals. Agreement between PR and NAV is low.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose To analyze the anatomical feasibility of transferring a motor
   branch nerve to the flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) to the triceps upper
   medial head motor branch (UMHM) and to report the resultant outcome of
   the restoration of elbow extension in 5 patients with extensive brachial
   plexus injury.
   Methods The ulnar and radial nerves were dissected in 10 cadavers. We
   measured the length and diameter of the branches to the FCU and the UMHM
   branch and counted the axons. Then, 5 male patients, mean age 30 years,
   underwent FCU nerve branch transfer for reconstruction of elbow
   extension. Elbow flexion was restored via a median nerve branch to
   biceps transfer.
   Results Mean UMHM nerve length and diameter were 86 and 1.5 mm,
   respectively. Mean number of branches to the FCU muscle was 2.9. Mean
   FCU nerve length and diameter were 50 and 1.0 mm, respectively. Mean
   number of myelinated fibers was 818 and 743 for the UMHM and the longest
   branch to the FCU, respectively. Coaptation between nerves was possible
   without tension. All patients recovered functional active elbow
   extension at a mean follow-up of 19 months with a British Medical
   Research Council score of M4. After surgery, all patients retained a
   functional FCU with a British Medical Research Council score of M4.
   Conclusions Nonselective ulnar nerve fascicles at the root of the limb
   might not be adequate to restore elbow extension when combined with a
   median nerve branch transfer for elbow flexion. A selective distal ulnar
   motor fascicle such as a FCU motor branch could be harvested and
   connected to a triceps branch to restore elbow extension. Such a nerve
   transfer would also allow for later transfer of the still functional FCU
   tendon to the digital extensors. (Copyright (C) 2015 by the American

Journal = {{COMPUTER STANDARDS \& INTERFACES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},
Pages = {{171-181}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Requirements concerning the specification and correct implementation of
   access control policies have become more and more popular in industrial
   networked systems during the last years. Unfortunately, the peculiar
   characteristics of industrial systems often prevent the designer from
   taking full advantage of technologies and techniques already developed
   and profitably employed in other application areas. In particular, the
   unavailability and/or impossibility of adopting hardware (h/w) and
   software (s/w) mechanisms able to automatically enforce the policies
   defined at a high level of abstraction, often results in checking the
   correctness of policy implementation in the real system manually. The
   first step towards carrying out this cumbersome task in an automated way
   is the development of a model able to capture both the high level policy
   specification as well as the details and low-level mechanisms
   characterizing the actual system implementation. This paper introduces a
   twofold model for the description of access control policies in
   industrial environments aimed at coping with this requirement and which
   can be profitably adopted in several kinds of automated analysis. (C)

Journal = {{CURRENT GENETICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{601-620}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this work is to characterize membrane transporter genes in
   Cercospora fungi required for autoresistance to the photoactivated,
   active-oxygen-generating toxin cercosporin they produce for infection of
   host plants. Previous studies implicated a role for diverse membrane
   transporters in cercosporin resistance. In this study, transporters
   identified in a subtractive cDNA library between a Cercospora nicotianae
   wild type and a cercosporin-sensitive mutant were characterized,
   including two ABC transporters (CnATR2, CnATR3), an MFS transporter
   (CnMFS2), a uracil transporter, and a zinc transport protein.
   Phylogenetic analysis showed that only CnATR3 clustered with
   transporters previously characterized to be involved in cercosporin
   resistance. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of gene expression under
   conditions of cercosporin toxicity, however, showed that only CnATR2 was
   upregulated, thus this gene was selected for further characterization.
   Transformation and expression of CnATR2 in the cercosporin-sensitive
   fungus Neurospora crassa significantly increased cercosporin resistance.
   Targeted gene disruption of CnATR2 in the wild type C. nicotianae,
   however, did not decrease resistance. Expression analysis of other
   transporters in the cnatr2 mutant under conditions of cercosporin
   toxicity showed significant upregulation of the cercosporin facilitator
   protein gene (CFP), encoding an MFS transporter previously characterized
   as playing an important role in cercosporin autoresistance in Cercospora
   species. We conclude that cercosporin autoresistance in Cercospora is
   mediated by multiple genes, and that the fungus compensates for
   mutations by up-regulation of other resistance genes. CnATR2 may be a
   useful gene, alone or in addition to other known resistance genes, for
   engineering Cercospora resistance in crop plants.}},

Title = {{National Trends in Ambulatory Surgery for Intervertebral Disc Disorders
   and Spinal Stenosis: A 12-Year Analysis of the National Surveys of
   Ambulatory Surgery}},

Abstract = {{Study Design. A descriptive epidemiology study.
   Objective. The aim of this study is to investigate changes in the
   utilization of ambulatory surgical procedures performed for
   intervertebral disc disorders and spinal stenosis between 1994 and 2006
   in the United States.
   Summary of Background Data. Understanding trends in the utilization of
   ambulatory spine surgery may improve health care delivery in the Unites
   States. Epidemiologic studies evaluating national practice patterns for
   ambulatory spine surgery are limited.
   Methods. The National Survey of Ambulatory Surgery conducted in 1994,
   1996, and 2006 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was
   analyzed to identify surgically managed patients with intervertebral
   disc disorders and spinal stenosis. Patients were divided into 1 of 3
   groups: discectomy, laminectomy, or fusion. The data were analyzed for
   trends in demographics, treatment, and utilization.
   Results. Between 1994 and 2006, the number of procedures increased by
   540\% for intervertebral disc disorders (6.1/100 000 capita to 34.2/100
   000 capita) and 926\% for spinal stenosis (0.38/100 000 capita to 3.46
   per 100 000 capita). Intervertebral fusions increased from 5\% of
   outpatient spine surgeries in 1994 to 17\% in 2006. The utilization of
   freestanding ambulatory facilities as the location of surgery increased
   340\% for intervertebral disc disorders and more than 2000\% for
   stenosis. Private insurance was the largest compensator, representing
   91\% of cases in 2006. An increasing proportion of females underwent
   surgery for intervertebral disc disorders and stenosis at these
   ambulatory facilities over this time period. Lumbar disc displacement
   remained the most common diagnosis at each time point.
   Conclusions. The rate of ambulatory surgery for intervertebral disc
   disorders and spinal stenosis increased dramatically between 1994 and
   2006 based upon the National Survey of Ambulatory Surgery data, which
   are the most up-to-date ambulatory surgery data available. These
   findings may aid policy-makers and caregivers in allocating health care
   resources to ensure the delivery of quality patient care.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are
   predicted to increase in the United States but the accuracy of prior
   forecasts and the contributions from various liver disease etiologies
   remain unclear. We aimed to determine the burden of cirrhosis and HCC
   according to underlying cause from 2001 to 2013. METHODS: We developed a
   national retrospective cohort of Veterans Affairs (VA) patients with the
   diagnosis of cirrhosis (n 129,998) or HCC (n = 21,326) from 2001 to
   2013. We used laboratory results, International Classification of
   Diseases, ninth edition (ICD-9) codes, and body mass index to identify
   underlying etiologies. RESULTS: In 2013, VA provided care to 5,720,614
   individuals, of whom 60,553 (1.06\%) had cirrhosis and 7,670 (0.13\%)
   had HCC. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) was present in an increasing proportion
   of cirrhosis and HCC between 2001 and 2013, reaching 48\% of cirrhosis
   cases and deaths and 67\% of HCC cases and deaths by 2013. Cirrhosis
   prevalence nearly doubled from 2001 to 2013 (664 to 1058 per 100,000
   enrollees), driven by HCV and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).
   Cirrhosis incidence ranged from 159 to 193 per 100,000 patient-years.
   Deaths in patients with cirrhosis increased from 83 to 126 per 100,000
   patient-years, largely driven by HCV. HCC incidence was 2.5-fold
   increased from 17 to 45 per 100,000 patient-years. HCC mortality tripled
   from 13 to 37 per 100,000 patient-years, driven overwhelmingly by HCV,
   with much smaller contributions from NAFLD and alcoholic liver disease.
   CONCLUSIONS: Cirrhosis prevalence and mortality and HCC incidence and
   mortality increased from 2001 to 2013, driven by HCV, with a smaller
   contribution from NAFLD. If current trends continue, cirrhosis
   prevalence will peak in 2021. Health care systems will need to
   accommodate rising numbers of patients with cirrhosis and HCC.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of the annealing atmosphere on the recrystallization of
   Ni-5\% Walloy used as substrate sheet for superconductor wire was
   investigated. The annealing was made in two different annealing
   atmospheres: hydrogen and argon. After analyzing the recrystallized
   texture and microstructure by EBSD, the main texture component formed in
   both annealing atmospheres is the \{100\}< 001 > cube orientation.
   Furthermore, it is shown that hydrogen promotes the cube texture
   development, while argon slows down its development. Besides, it is
   shown that hydrogen favors the triggering of the abnormal grain growth
   at a temperature higher than 1 120 degrees C, while under argon, the
   abnormal grain growth is not observed before 1 200 degrees C. Then, an
   optimized annealing process has been put forward combining both the
   atmospheres. Note that the origin of hydrogen and argon effects on
   boundary mobility is also discussed.}},

   explores the potential consequence of their exposure to Internet
   pornography for their academic performance. An integrative path model
   indicated that pubertal timing and sensation seeking predicted the use
   of Internet pornography. Boys with an advanced pubertal stage and boys
   high in sensation seeking more frequently used Internet pornography.
   Moreover, an increased use of Internet pornography decreased boys'
   academic performance 6 months later. The discussion focuses on the

Abstract = {{Many consumer choice situations are characterized by the simultaneous
   demand for multiple alternatives that are imperfect substitutes for one
   another, along with a continuous quantity dimension for each chosen
   alternative. To model such multiple discrete-continuous choices, most
   multiple discrete-continuous models in the literature use an
   additively-separable utility function, with the assumption that the
   marginal utility of one good is independent of the consumption of
   another good. In this paper, we develop model formulations for multiple
   discrete-continuous choices that accommodate rich substitution
   structures and complementarity effects in the consumption patterns, and
   demonstrate an application of the model to transportation-related
   expenditures using data drawn from the 2002 Consumer Expenditure (CEX)
   Survey. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Liquid chromatography at critical conditions (LCCC) of poly(propylene)
   (PP) holds unique potential to further augment the understanding of
   molecular heterogeneities present in PP. The critical conditions for
   isotactic poly(propylene) (iPP) and syndiotactic poly(propylene) (sPP)
   have been identified using porous graphitic carbon as stationary phase
   and combinations of adsorption and desorption promoting solvents. It is
   found that 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene is a stronger desorption promoting
   eluent compared to 1,2-dichlorobenzene, while 2-octanol shows a weaker
   adsorption promoting effect compared to 2-ethyl-1-hexanol for all
   stereo-isomeric forms of PP. The fraction of desorption promoting
   solvent needs to reach critical conditions decreased in a linear manner
   with the temperature. High temperature 2D liquid chromatography with
   infrared detection provides quantitative information about the fractions
   of the constituents (iPP and ethylene-propylene copolymer) of a model

Abstract = {{The seasonal life cycle and biology of a white grub beetle, Lepidiota
   mansueta Burmeister (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae), were studied on Majuli
   river island and in the laboratory during 2005-2010. This species has
   become an extremely serious pest of many field crops on Majuli river
   island, the largest mid-river deltaic island of the world. L. mansueta
   has a biennial life cycle, the first of its kind in North East India,
   and the duration of egg, grub, and pupal stages varied from 12 to 17,
   635 to 671, and 28 to 35 days, respectively. Third instar grubs as heavy
   as 6 g caused heavy damage to crops and had a prolonged developmental
   period ranging from 545 to 563 days in the laboratory (27 A degrees C).
   L. mansueta can be regarded as a rare species, because it spends its
   entire life cycle under the ground except for a short period during
   which adults emerge from the ground for mating. There was no evidence
   that the adults fed on plants either in the field or in the laboratory
   and hence this species has the unique distinction of being the first
   Indian phytophagous white grub species with nonfeeding adults.}},

Journal = {{ENEURO}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Casting behavior (zigzagging across an odor stream) is common in
   air/liquid-borne odor tracking in open fields; however, terrestrial odor
   localization often involves path selection in a familiar environment. To
   study this, we trained rats to run toward an odor source in a
   multi-choice olfactory arena with near-laminar airflow. We find that
   rather than casting, rats run directly toward an odor port, and if this
   is incorrect, they serially sample other sources. This behavior is
   consistent and accurate in the presence of perturbations, such as novel
   odors, background odor, unilateral nostril stitching, and turbulence. We
   developed a model that predicts that this run-and-scan tracking of
   air-borne odors is faster than casting, provided there are a small
   number of targets at known locations. Thus, the combination of
   best-guess target selection with fallback serial sampling provides a
   rapid and robust strategy for finding odor sources in familiar
   surroundings.}},

Abstract = {{Osteosarcoma (OS) is a prevalent, fast growing cancer. Identification of
   molecular regulation of OS growth may result in development of a novel
   therapy. Previous studies have highlighted a role of microRNAs (miRNAs)
   in the regulation of the carcinogenesis of OS, whereas the underlying
   mechanisms are not completely understood. Moreover, a role of miR-100 in
   the growth control of OS is not clear. Here we reported significantly
   higher levels of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) and
   significantly lower levels of miR-100 in the OS specimen, compared to
   those in the paired normal bone tissues. Bioinformatics analysis and
   luciferase reporter assay suggest that miR-100 binds to the 3'UTR of
   FGFR3 mRNA to prevent its translation. To prove it, we modified miR-100
   levels in OS cells. We found that overexpression of miR-100 in OS cells
   decreased FGFR3 protein levels, whereas inhibition of miR-100 increased
   FGFR3 protein levels, without affecting FGFR3 transcripts. Moreover,
   overexpression of miR-100 suppressed the OS growth in vitro and in vivo,
   while inhibition of miR-100 significantly increased OS growth. Taken
   together, our data demonstrate that miR-100 may inhibit the growth of OS
   through FGFR3.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized by the traditional
   Hummers method and the composite film of poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and
   GO was prepared using solution casting method. The structure and
   properties of GO and PVA/GO film were characterized by Fourier-transform
   infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
   thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), tensile and oxygen barrier tests in
   detail. FTIR results proved that the natural graphite had been oxidized.
   The layer structure of natural graphite was exfoliated during the
   process of oxidation and ultrasonication. For the PVA/GO composite film,
   both tensile strength and Young's modulus were improved with the
   increase of GO wt\%. The Young's modulus of the composite film with 4
   wt\% GO obviously increased by 900\% over that of the neat PVA film. In
   addition, a remarkable improvement in the barrier properties of the
   PVA/GO composite film was also achieved. The oxygen transmission rate
   and the oxygen permeability coefficient of the composite film were

Abstract = {{In some situations, economic theory provides directions for constructing
   an econometric model, while in others (generalized) linear modeling is
   used only for convenience. The latter is especially true for modeling
   transport demand functions as economic theory is often limited to
   predicting whether a covariate is expected to have a positive or a
   negative impact. However, functional misspecification can have serious
   consequences for estimation, prediction, and further inferences. The
   authors introduce a semiparametric model and a corresponding estimation
   procedure that is easy to interpret and implement. Using an empirical
   study of university students' transport choices in the Bilbao area, we
   illustrate how this procedure can help to significantly improve
   statistical analysis. More specifically, our procedure allows the
   utility that individuals get from the mode of transport to be modeled
   and estimated in a flexible way, thus essentially mitigating the danger
   of misspecification errors.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, several diffusion sources are investigated, aiming at
   codiffusion for the fabrication of back-contact back-junction (BC-BJ)
   silicon solar cell. As a gaseous diffusion source, a POCl3-diffusion
   process is investigated, and for solid diffusion sources, phosphorus-
   and boron-doped silicate glass (PSG and BSG) deposited by the means of
   plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition are considered. The n(+)
   -doped areas diffused from a solid PSG layer allow for a precise
   adjustment of the sheet resistance (R-sh) in the range of 40-400
   Omega/sq, along with a dark saturation current density (J(o)) of 55
   fA/cm(2). Subsequently, boron diffusion from solid BSG layer leads to
   p(+) -doped areas with high doping levels (R-sh = 50 Omega/sq). However,
   gaseous POCl3 diffusion in combination with solid boron diffusion from
   the BSG layer can only be successfully performed if the BSG layer is
   protected with an SiOx layer. Furthermore, by adjusting the gas flows
   during POCl3 diffusion, n+ -doped areas with Rsh in the range of 150-300
   Omega/sq are achieved. The corresponding surfaces feature Jo values of
   30 fA/cm(2). The result of this study is a flexible codiffusion setup
   allowing for the efficient integration in advanced process chains of
   BC-BJ solar cells which results in the cell efficiencies well above
   above eta = 20\%.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This study provides the first United States (US) national
   data regarding frequency, cost and mortality rate of epidural hematoma
   (EDH) and determines the factors affecting the morbidity and deaths in
   the patients with EDH undergoing surgical evacuation.
   Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed by searching the
   Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 2003 to 2010, the largest all
   payer database of non-federal community hospitals in the US. All cases
   of EDH were indentified using ICD-9 codes.
   Results: A total of 5189 admissions were identified in the NIS database,
   and incidence was highest in the second decade (33.4\%). The median
   length of stay in the hospital was about 4 days in each year (2003-2010)
   without significant difference. The percent of discharge disposition
   other than home was about 2-3\% in the entire cohort, with the highest
   in 2009(3\%). The average cost per admission increased significantly
   (80\%) from \$45,850 in 2003 to \$82,800 in 2010. The inhospital
   mortality and complication rate was 3.5\% and 2.9\%, respectively.
   Factors affecting in-hospital mortality rate were age (<= 18 yr vs. >18
   yr, P < 0.001), insurance type (medicare vs. private insurance, P <
   0.001), co-morbidities (high vs. low, P < 0.001), hospital volume (high
   vs. low volume, P < 0.001), physician's case volumes (high vs. low
   volume, P < 0.02), hospital type (teaching vs. non-teaching, P < 0.01)
   and hospital region (South vs. others, P < 0.02). Similarly, factors
   affecting adverse outcome at discharge were age (<= 18 yr vs. >18 yr, P
   < 0.001), female gender (P < 0.001), median income (fourth quartile vs.
   other, P< 0.001), ethnicity (African-American vs. non-African-American,
   P < 0.02), insurance type (medicare vs. private insurance, P < 0.001),
   co-morbidities (high vs. low, P < 0.001), hospital case volume (4th
   quartile volume vs. other, P < 0.001), physician's case volume (4th
   quartile volume vs. other, P < 0.0001), hospital type (teaching vs.
   non-teaching, hospital bed size (small vs. large, P < 0.001), hospital
   region (Northeast vs. others, P< 0.001) and hospital location (urban vs.
   rural, P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Nationally, there has been no significant change in the
   frequency of EDH. However, its cost is increasing rapidly. Published by

   activities contained in the revised annual post-market environmental

   provided by Monsanto Europe S.A. The supplied data do not indicate any
   unanticipated adverse effects on human and animal health or the
   environment arising from the cultivation of maize MON 810 cultivation in
   2013. Similar methodological shortcomings to those observed in previous
   annual PMEM reports were identified in the analysis of farmer
   questionnaires and the conduct of the literature review. The EFSA GMO
   Panel therefore strongly reiterates its previous recommendations to
   improve the methodology of future annual PMEM reports on maize MON 810.
   The EFSA GMO Panel urges the applicant to consider how to make best use
   of the information recorded in national registers in order to optimise
   sampling for farmer questionnaires, reiterates its previous
   recommendations on insect resistance monitoring and continued screening,
   and requests to continue reviewing and discussing relevant scientific
   publications on possible adverse effects of maize MON 810 on rove
   beetles. Also, the EFSA GMO Panel encourages relevant parties to
   continue developing a methodological framework to use existing networks
   in the broader context of environmental monitoring. (C) European Food

Abstract = {{Effective handoff communication is critical for patient safety. Research
   is needed to understand how information processes occurring intra-shift
   impact handoff effectiveness. The purpose of this qualitative study was
   to examine medical-surgical nurses' (n = 21) perspectives about
   processes that promote and hinder patient safety intra-shift and during
   handoff. Results indicated that offgoing nurses' ability to grasp the
   story intra-shift was essential to convey the full picture during
   handoff. When oncoming nurses understood the picture being conveyed at
   the handoff, nurses jointly painted a full picture. Arriving and leaving
   the handoff with this level of information promoted patient safety.
   However, intra-shift disruptions often impeded nurses in their processes
   to grasp the story thus posing risks to patient safety. Improvement
   efforts need to target the different processes involved in grasping the
   story and painting a full picture. Future research needs to examine

Abstract = {{We study the time evolution of photon number parity operator for a
   single-mode quantized cavity field interacting with a two-level atom as
   described by the resonant Jaynes-Cummings model. With the field prepared
   in a coherent state and the atom prepared in its excited state, we find
   that the photon number parity undergoes oscillations at the Rabi
   frequency but only during the period between the collapse and revival of
   the Rabi oscillations of the atomic inversion. We explain this in terms
   of the global parity of the Jaynes-Cummings model. The phenomenon is
   related to the interference of the counter-rotating components of the
   field in phase space, which in turn gives rise to occurrence of highly
   oscillatory photon number probability distributions near half the
   revival time of the atomic inversion noted by Buzek et al. (Phys. Rev. A
   45,1992, p. 8190). Detection of the photon number oscillations would
   amount to a detection of this interference effect. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{American zombie Gothic films have changed markedly in their tone, style,
   and structure since September 11, an evolution that expands the Gothic
   mode to include the mobility of the narratives' protagonists, a
   popularisation of the movies, and an increased engagement with a
   multi-ethnic, international community. To remain timely, relevant, and
   commercially viable, such alterations must occur, and these shifts in
   particular can best be explained by the changing cinematic marketplace,
   the influence of videogames, and the policies and anxieties resulting
   from the (inter) national trauma of 9/11 and the War on Terror. This
   essay examines the film version of World War Z as a key text for
   exploring the current transition from a localised siege narrative to an
   international kind of `road trip' movie, a shift largely tied to the
   popularity of zombie-themed videogames.}},

Abstract = {{Nitric oxide (NO) is a chemically diffusible molecular messenger playing
   various roles in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Nitric oxide
   synthase (NOS) is the key enzyme in synthesis of NO. The neuroanatomical
   distribution pattern of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) was
   studied and developing stages of Labeo rohita such as hatchlings (10-15
   mm), frys (15-35 mm), semi-fingerlings (35-65 mm), fingerlings (65-100
   mm) and adults (350-370 mm) were used. In the telencephalon, nitrergic
   cells were observed in both pallial and subpallial regions along with
   entopeduncular nucleus suggesting the involvement of NO in the control
   of sensory functions throughout the development. In the diencephalon,
   nNOS positive neurons were localized in the nucleus preopticus
   periventricularis and preopticus parvocellularis throughout development
   while nucleus preopticus magnocellularis was found immunopositive only
   in adult specimens who suggest the involvement of NO in the hormonal
   regulation. nNOS immunoreaction was also noted in suprachaismatic
   nucleus, habenula, lateral tuberal nucleus, paraventricular organ and
   anterior division of preglomerular nucleus throughout development. In
   the mesencephalic region, nNOS immunoreactivity was seen in the optic
   tectum, torus longitudinalis, nucleus of median longitudinal fascicle
   and occulomotor nucleus indicate the role of NO in integration of visual
   inputs and modulates motor control of the eyes and movements. Caudally,
   in the rhombencephalon, the cerebellum, the nucleus reticularis, the
   octaval nucleus and the motor nucleus of vagal nerve were nNOS positive
   during development. nNOS reactive cells and fibers were noted in the
   spinal motor column, thus suggesting a role of NO in gestation and
   startle response from early development. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Data decomposition techniques have become a standard approach for the
   analysis of 2D imaging data originating from optically accessible
   internal combustion engines. In particular, the method of Proper
   Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) has proven to be a valuable tool for the
   evaluation of cycle-to-cycle variability based on luminous combustion
   imaging and particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements. POD basically
   permits to characterize the dominant structures of the process under
   consideration. Recently, an alternative procedure based on Independent
   Component Analysis (ICA) has been introduced in the engine field. Unlike
   POD, the method of ICA identifies the patterns corresponding to physical
   processes that are statistically independent. In this work, a Group-ICA
   approach is applied to 2D cycle-resolved images of the luminosity
   emitted by the combustion process. The analysis is meant to characterize
   cyclic variability of a port fuel injection spark ignition (PFI SI)
   engine. For example, any flame front ignited independently by a hot spot
   is expected to behave independently from the other observed flames. In
   the Group-ICA approach, image sequences collected synchronically over a
   number of cycles are grouped together and then analyzed to identify
   common independent components. These should correspond to the
   independent phenomena underlying the combustion process at the group
   level. By this way, a projection is implicitly defined that permits the
   reconstruction of each member of the group (cycle) through the
   independent components and their coefficients. The successive analysis
   of the associated time courses (coefficients), specific for each cycle,
   permits to capture and discuss differences among cycles.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the impact of repeated exposures on word learning of

   collected after single exposures to words and following three exposures
   through individual training sessions. A significant main effect for
   Exposure was found for identification with significant Hearing Status x
   Exposure interaction, with children in the NH outperforming the HL group
   when only one exposure to the target words was provided. Repeated
   exposures to target words provide benefits to both groups of preschool
   children, but offer additional benefits to children with HL,

   partially completed structures while preparing surfaces for optimal

Abstract = {{The infant and toddler years are crucial for the development of
   prosocial behaviour, such as helping, sharing, comforting and
   cooperation. Recent evidence suggests that the correlates of different
   types of prosocial behaviour may differ. The current study investigated
   whether child, maternal parenting and situational characteristics were
   differentially associated with toddlers' cooperation and concern with a
   peer. The sample, drawn from the National Institute of Child Health and
   Human Development Study of Early Child Care, included the 612 children
   who participated in the 36-month dyadic play session and their mothers.
   The results indicated that girls were more cooperative and expressed
   more concern than boys. Greater sustained attention to toys was
   associated with lower cooperation. Children were more cooperative with
   peers who engaged in more positive social interaction, and expressed
   more concern with peers that they had a close relationship with.
   Maternal sensitivity at 24 months was associated with greater
   cooperation when the peer engaged in more positive social behaviour.
   Finally, both maternal sensitivity and cognitive stimulation at 15
   months indirectly influenced toddlers' cooperation through maternal
   sensitivity at 24 months, underscoring the predictive power of early
   parenting when children are rapidly developing the capacity to engage in
   prosocial behaviour. Overall, the results highlight some differences in
   the correlates of toddlers' cooperation and concern. Copyright (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This article investigates women's representation in the decision-making
   bodies of trade unions and the influences of sector, employee status and

   it follows that characteristics of both the members and the domain -
   such as sector, employee status and qualification - also influence the
   structures and make-up of trade unions and thus the degree of women's
   participation in decision-making bodies. The study includes all Austrian
   and most of the German trade unions. Data are drawn from documentary
   material of the unions and expert interviews with union officials. The
   analysis shows that the services sector in combination with a
   blue-collar status produces a negative effect on women's participation
   in unions' decision-making structures, while higher qualification has a
   positive effect.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of airflow nonuniformity on the thermal-hydraulic
   performance of a fin-and-tube heat exchanger were investigated
   experimentally. The test subject was a four-depth-row fin-and-tube heat
   exchanger with face split tube circuitry. Nonuniform inlet air
   distribution was generated by partially blocking the heat exchanger
   entrance cross-section. It was found that airflow nonuniformity causes
   thermal effectiveness deterioration and pressure drop increase. The size
   of effectiveness deterioration and pressure drop increase depend on the
   degree of airflow nonuniformity as well as on the orientation between
   airflow nonuniformity and tube-side fluid circuitry. For most of the
   observed nonuniform airflow profiles, which had low or moderate degrees
   of airflow nonuniformity, the effectiveness deterioration was between
   5\% and 10\%, while the pressure drop increase was between 10\% and
   20\%. For severely nonuniform airflow profiles the effectiveness
   deterioration was up to 30\% and the pressure drop increase was up to
   90\%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and International Institute of

Volume = {{38}},

Abstract = {{Larvae of most coastal marine invertebrates develop through a series of
   pelagic stages in the inner shelf regions where they are subject to
   strong velocity fields, including buoyancy-driven flows from river
   plumes. Taxon-specific larval behavior can interact with flow fields to
   determine dispersal trajectories. In this study, we examined the
   hydrodynamic features of the Saco River plume (in the southwestern Gulf
   of Maine) from July to August and explored how larval behavior may alter
   the distribution of mytilid (i.e., Mytilus and Modiolus) bivalve larvae
   and three genera of brachyuran (Carcinus, Hemigrapsus, and Cancer) crab
   larvae in and around that plume. Hydrographic surveys (via
   conductivity-temperature-depth casts) and larval sampling (via plankton
   tows) were conducted to assess temporal and spatial variation in the
   horizontal and vertical distribution of larvae. The horizontal extent of
   the Saco River plume varied little during our study and was governed by
   both inertial and rotational effects. Late stage mytilid larvae were
   relatively homogeneously distributed in and out of the plume, while the
   distribution of brachyuran larvae varied among different locations,
   species, and larval stages. We conclude that mytilid larvae entered the
   plume through physical entrainment and/or upward swimming processes and
   could tolerate salinities associated with the plume (< 25). By contrast,
   brachyuran larvae avoided the plume via downward swimming to avoid
   osmotic stress, or had perished prior to sampling.}},

Abstract = {{There is increasing recognition that combat-related posttraumatic stress
   disorder (PTSD) affects the service member or veteran who experienced
   the trauma, his or her partner, and their relationship more broadly.
   Reactions by partners and other loved ones can also serve as impediments

   article, we highlight research findings related to the association
   between PTSD symptoms and intimate relationship functioning in service
   members and veterans from the current conflicts and describe the
   application of cognitive-behavioral conjoint therapy for PTSD (CBCT for
   PTSD; Monson \& Fredman, 2012), a disorder-specific couple therapy
   designed to simultaneously decrease PTSD symptoms and enhance intimate
   relationship functioning, to a veteran with combat-related PTSD and his
   wife. We conclude by discussing the powoful role that partners can play
   in helping individuals with combat-related PTSD recover from the
   disorder through improved communication, decreased couple-level
   avoidance, and modification of cognitions held by either member of the
   couple that can maintain PTSD symptoms and/or relationship distress.}},

Abstract = {{The in-situ capacitance and dielectric properties of 25 MeV C4+ ion
   irradiated Ni/n-GaAs Schottky barrier diode (SBD) were studied at 100
   kHz in the fluence range 5 x 10(10) -5 x 10(13) ions/cm(2). The
   investigation shows reduction in capacitance and charge density with
   increase in ion fluence. Consequent changes were observed in other
   related parameters like conductance, dielectric constant, dielectric
   loss, loss tangent and electrical modulus. The results were interpreted
   in terms of generation of swift heavy ion induced acceptor trap states
   by electronic energy loss mechanism. Besides, the switch over
   characteristics of depletion to inversion regions in the CV plot reveals
   minority carrier recombination centers also. The dispersion and
   relaxation peaks observed in bias dependent dielectric plots were
   ascribed to the polarization and relaxation mechanism due to the
   interfacial trap states. The traps and recombination centers were found
   to alter the barrier characteristics of the fabricated SBD depending
   upon the ion fluence. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective was to determine the relationship between seminal plasma
   proteins and sperm morphology in Bos indicus bulls of the Brahman breed.
   Fifty-six 24-month-old Australian Brahman bulls were electroejaculated
   and samples were examined to determine the percentage of morphologically
   normal sperm (PNS24) and the seminal plasma protein composition was
   identified and quantified by 2-D gel electrophoresis. The total
   integrated optical density of 152 seminal plasma protein spots (SPPs)
   across all gels was determined using the PDQuest software version 8.0
   (Bio Rad, USA). Using a single regression mixed model with the density
   of individual spots as a covariate for PNS24, 17 SPPs were significantly
   associated with PNS24 (p<0.05). A multiple regression analyses of these
   SPPs, using three models; non-parametric Tree Model, Generalized
   Additive Model, and a step-wise selection method were conducted, and 6
   SPPs could be used to predict PNS24; four SPPs had positive and two had
   negative association with PNS24. Together these spots explained 35\% of
   the phenotypic variation in PNS24. Using mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF
   and TripleToF-MS)the SPPs with positive relationship contained mainly
   apolipoprotein A-I (1310), protein DJ-1 and glutathione peroxidase 3
   (2308), phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (6402) and apolipoprotein A-I and
   secretoglobin family 1D member (8008). The SPPs inversely associated
   with PNS24 were clusterin/seminal plasma protein A3 (1411) and
   epididymal secretory protein El (8108). This is the first comprehensive
   report on the association between seminal plasma protein composition in
   Bos indicus Brahman bulls and sperm morphology. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{A standard method for finding a rational number from its values modulo a
   collection of primes is to determine its value modulo the product of the
   primes via Chinese remaindering, and then use Farey sequences for
   rational reconstruction. Successively enlarging the set of primes if
   needed, this method is guaranteed to work if we restrict ourselves to
   ``good{''} primes. Depending on the particular application, however,
   there may be no efficient way of identifying good primes.
   In the algebraic and geometric applications we have in mind, the final
   result consists of an a priori unknown ideal (or module) which is found
   via a construction yielding the (reduced) Grobner basis of the ideal. In
   this context, we discuss a general setup for modular and, thus,
   potentially parallel algorithms which can handle ``bad{''} primes. A new
   key ingredient is an error tolerant algorithm for rational
   reconstruction via Gaussian reduction.}},

Abstract = {{The electrical rock conductivity is a sensitive indicator for carbon
   dioxide (CO2) injection and migration processes. For a reliable
   balancing of the free CO2 in pore space with petrophysical models such
   as Archie's law or for the detection of migrating CO2, detailed
   knowledge of the pore water conductivity during interaction with CO2 is
   essential but not available yet. Contrary to common assumptions, pore
   water conductivity cannot be assumed constant since CO2 is a reactive
   gas that dissolves into the pore water in large amounts and provides
   additional charge carriers due to the dissociation of carbonic acid. We
   consequently carried out systematic laboratory experiments to quantify
   and analyse the changes in saline pore water conductivity caused by CO2
   at thermodynamic equilibrium. Electrical conductivity is measured on
   pore water samples for pressures up to 30 MPa and temperatures up to 80
   degrees C. The parameter range covers the gaseous, liquid and
   supercritical state of the CO2 involved. Pore water salinities from
   0.006 up to 57.27 g L-1 sodium chloride were investigated as well as
   selective other ion species. At the same time, the CO2 concentration in
   the salt solution was determined by a wet-chemical procedure. A
   two-regime behaviour appears: for small salinities, we observe an
   increase of up to more than factor 3 in the electrical pore water
   conductivity, which strongly depends on the solution salinity
   (low-salinity regime). This is an expected behaviour, since the
   additional ions originating from the dissociation of carbonic acid
   positively contribute to the solution conductivity. However, when
   increasing salinities are considered this effect is completely
   diminished. For highly saline solutions, the increased mutual impeding
   causes the mobility of all ions to decrease, which may result in a
   significant reduction of conductivity by up to 15 per cent despite the
   added CO2 (high-salinity regime). We present the data set covering the
   pressure, temperature, salinity and ion species dependence of the CO2
   effect. Furthermore, the observations are analysed and predicted with a
   semi-analytical formulation for the electrical pore water conductivity
   taking into account the species' interactions. For the applicability of
   our results in practice of exploration and monitoring, we additionally
   provide a purely empirical formulation to compute the impact of CO2 on
   pore water conductivity at equilibrium which only requires the input of
   pressure, temperature and salinity information.}},

Abstract = {{The paper aims at presentation of the effect of changes in the catchment
   area management on the value of water quality physicochemical indices
   along the length of the Iwoniczanka stream, which flows through
   Iwonicz-Zdroj, one of the oldest health resorts in Poland. Analyses of
   14 water quality indices were conducted from November 2013 to May 2014
   in five measurement points: two situated in the upper course of the
   stream - in forest areas, two located in the area of Iwonicz-Zdroj town,
   and one below the rural built-up area. On the basis of the conducted
   data analysis it was found that the mean values of pH, electrolytic
   conductivity, sulphates, calcium, total iron and manganese were
   increasing with the course of flowing water, as evidenced by the water
   enrichment in substances which had their sources in built-up areas. On
   average, the highest values of biogenic indices and chlorides but the
   lowest values of oxygen indices were registered immediately below the
   location of drain collector from the closed sewage treatment plant,
   which resulted in pollution of the analysed stream bed with the
   substances previously drained from the treatment plant. Water flowing
   through the forest areas had the maximum ecological potential in the
   built-up areas and due to phosphate concentrations it was classified to
   class II and then, due to self-purification, returned to the
   physicochemical parameters appropriate for class I water. The conducted
   hydro-chemical tests confirmed a significant negative effect of built-up
   areas on the quality of the flowing waters.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Pharmacologic effects of nicotine are multifaceted and
   complicated. Despite numerous studies, the effect of smoking on lower
   urinary tract functions, have not been yet studied in detail. In this
   study, we aimed to investigate the effects of smoking addiction on lower
   urinary tract and sexual functions on the basis of respiratory
   functions.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 186 male patients who have been
   evaluated between May 2014 and January 2015 were recruited in this
   study. Smoking history, respiratory symptoms, respiratory function
   tests, uroflowmetry parameters relating to lower urinary tract symptoms
   (LUTS), prostate volume, post-voiding residual urine volume and sexual
   functions of patients have been retrospectively investigated.
   Results: We determined that as the mean number of cigarettes smoked
   daily increases, post-void residual urine volume and International
   Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) also increase. Moreover in accordance with
   this finding, mean urinary flow rates and quality of life scores were
   statistically significantly decreased. In smoking addicts who have high
   mean package/year, post-void residual urine volume and IPSS levels were
   increased but proportionately maximum urinary flow rate and average
   urinary flow rate plus quality of life scores were found to be
   statistically significantly decreased. In patients with forced
   expiratory volume in first second:forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio
   less than 80\%, mean urinary flow rates were found to be statistically
   significantly low. Also, we determined that in smoking addicts who have
   high mean package/year, erectile functions were statistically
   significantly impaired.
   Conclusion: We showed negative impacts of smoking addiction on LUTS,
   patient's quality of life, and sexual functions.}},

Abstract = {{Today, an ever-increasing number of devices has networking capability.
   The main implication of this fact is that such devices are often left
   fully powered yet idle just to maintain their network presence, hence
   leading to large energy waste. This ultimately results in higher
   electricity cost for consumers.
   This paper tackles an effective mechanism to reduce energy waste of
   consumer electronics, by boosting the usage of lowpower states available
   in most devices. The main concept is to delegate background networking
   routines to home gateways, which are today available in most homes and
   offices. The paper describes the functionality and the software
   architecture to be implemented by home gateways and consumer
   electronics, reports performance evaluation on a working prototype, and
   provides estimation of potential benefits for consumers(1).}},

Abstract = {{A systematic analysis of green-house gases emission (carbon footprint)
   and primary energy consumption (energy footprint) of prefabricated
   industrial buildings during their entire life cycle is presented. The
   life cycle assessment (LCA) study was performed in a cradle-to grave
   approach: site-specific data from an Italian company, directly involved
   in all the phases from raw material manufacturing to in-situ assembly,
   were used to analyze the impacts as a function of different design
   choices. Four buildings were analyzed and results were used to setup a
   parameterized model that was used to study the impacts of industrial
   prefabricated buildings over the input parameter space. The model vs.
   data agreement is within 4\% for both carbon and energy footprint. The
   functional unit is 1 m(3) of prefabricated building, considering a
   50-year lifetime. The results of the four buildings decrease from 144.6
   kgCO(2eq)/m(3) and 649.5 kWh/m(3) down to 123.5 kgCO(2eq)/m(3) and 556.8
   kWh/m(3) as the building floor area increases from 1048 m(2) to 21,910
   m(2). The use phase accounts for the major impact (approximate 76\%). It
   is found that the carbon footprint is proportional to the energy
   footprint, the proportional factor being 0.222 kgCO(2eq)/kWh within
   0.5\% accuracy. Finally, a systematic study of the sensitivity of input
   parameters (insulation, lifetime, foundation type) is presented.}},

Abstract = {{This article discusses the problem of exceeding amplitudes of mistuned
   structures caused by accelerated traveling waves type excitation, i.e.,
   traveling waves with time variant frequencies. These waves cause
   resonance passages of, e.g., rotating structures. To calculate the
   resonance passage a semi-analytical solution is proposed. Thus, high
   accuracy is guaranteed. The topic of exceeding amplitudes is initially
   approached by studying a discrete lumped mass model with detuned
   parameters. It can be shown that under certain circumstances the maximum
   amplitude of the transient resonance passage is even higher than the
   maximum amplitude of the steady-state solution. To investigate this
   phenomenon on a real bladed disk, the number of degrees of freedom of
   the blisk is reduced using component mode synthesis (CMS). By applying
   the semi-analytical solution to the reduced model, the envelopes of the
   vibration during resonance passage can be calculated. Processing
   extensive parametric studies it can be pointed out under which
   circumstances the probability rises that higher maximum amplitudes occur
   during resonance passage compared to steady-state conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Sensitivity and electro-static discharges (ESD) protection level are
   crucial parameters for any Ultra High-Frequency (UHF) power
   rectifier-harvester designed for radio-frequency identification (RFID)
   devices. While sensitivity limits the reading range of the
   interrogator-to-tag communication link, the requirement for an adequate
   protection against ESD is enforced in commercial devices connected to a
   printed antenna. Both resistive and capacitive parasitics of the
   protection circuits severely affect RF performance of the device. In the
   paper, a rectifier for UHF RFID embedding an ESD protection for 2kV
   human-body discharge model (HBM) level is proposed. The target of a low
   added parasitic capacitance is achieved by adapting the protection
   circuit to the RFID rectifier and reusing the ESD clamp for additional
   functions being mandatory in a UHF RFID front end. The layout of the ESD
   clamp has been optimized for minimum parasitic resistance without
   sacrificing the protection level. Two UHF harvesters were implemented in
   a 180nm digital complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)
   technology, featuring a minimum sensitivity of -15.5dBm with an ESD
   protection level of 2kV HBM. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In current study, the tested material is a glass fiber reinforced
   polyester matrix composite with one stacking sequence namely
   {[}0/90](s). First of all, the solid particle erosion behavior of
   composite samples was investigated under various impingement angles (15
   degrees, 30 degrees, 45 degrees, 60 degrees, 75 degrees, and 90 degrees,
   respectively). Eroded composite samples were examined by non-contact
   optical profilometer and 3D surface roughness maps were obtained. From
   optical profilometer results, it was clearly shown that values of
   erosion crater hole volumes were well suited with erosion rate values
   versus impingement angles. Maximum and minimum erosion crater hole
   volumes observed at 60 degrees and 15 degrees impingement angles due to
   semi-ductile characteristic of the target material, respectively. After
   erosion tests, the scratch behavior of composite samples was examined.
   The results showed that the coefficient of friction was decreased by the
   increase in impingement angles of 45 degrees and 60 degrees. The maximum
   scratch hardness value was determined at 60 degrees impingement angle.
   Scratch damage morphologies were determined by using optical microscope
   and scanning electron microscope. It was observed that low (15 degrees
   and 30 degrees) and high (75 degrees and 90 degrees) impingement angles
   result in remarkably severe surface deformation on the samples. (c) 2014

   crystalline phase of silver with the lattice constant 4.0838 nm. The
   average size of silver nanoclusters, as obtained from the scanning
   electron microscopy analysis is about 30 nm which is consistent with the
   X-ray diffraction results. The temperature dependent catalytic activity
   of prepared composites is demonstrated for two model reactions such as
   reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) and decomposition of hydrogen
   peroxide. Apparent constant rates and activation energy as well as
   reusability of catalysts were determined. The developed composite
   catalyst could be used consecutively for several runs without any
   damages for 4-NP reduction. For hydrogen peroxide reaction decomposition
   the reaction rate of the second cycle is reduced 2.4 times. Moreover,

Abstract = {{Cellulosic materials are ones of the most frequently used because they
   have the ability to absorb moisture, but under certain conditions of
   humidity and temperature they can be subjected to microbial attack. In
   this study, an attempt has been made to obtain antimicrobial finishing
   on cotton material by the using of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and
   poly(acrylic acid)(PAA). Silver nanoparticles, were obtained by reducing
   silver ions from AgNO3 solution by various exposure methods to UV
   radiation. The surface characterization of materials was performed using
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis
   (EDAX). The results indicated that AgNPs were successfully integrated
   and dispersed in the matrix. Antibacterial activity was evaluated
   against Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli) and Gram positive
   bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus).The application of antimicrobial
   treatment with poly(acrylic acid) and AgNPs on the material confers
   durability to washing.}},

   similar to the well-known feasibility condition for arc capacities in
   ordinary multi-commodity flows. The condition can be expressed in terms
   of a class of metric inequalities for routings on direct connections. We

Abstract = {{Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused
   by a heterozygous deletion of 26-28 genes at chromosome band 7q11.23.
   Haploinsufficiency at GTF2I has been shown to play a major role in the
   neurobehavioral phenotype. By characterizing the neuronal architecture
   in four animal models with intragenic, partial, and complete deletions
   of the WBS critical interval (Delta Gtf2i(+/-), Delta Gtf2i(-/-), PD,
   and CD), we clarify the involvement of Gtf2i in neurocognitive features.
   All mutant mice showed hypersociability, impaired motor learning and
   coordination, and altered anxiety-like behavior. Dendritic length was
   decreased in the CA1 of Delta Gtf2i(+/-), Delta Gtf2i(-/-), and CD mice.
   Spine density was reduced, and spines were shorter in Delta Gtf2i(-/-),
   PD, and CD mice. Overexpression of Pik3r1 and downregulation of Bdnf
   were observed in Delta Gtf2i(+/-), PD, and CD mice. Intracisternal
   Gtf2i-gene therapy in CD mice using adeno-associated virus resulted in
   increased mGtf2i expression and normalization of Bdnf levels, along with
   beneficial effects in motor coordination, sociability, and anxiety,
   despite no significant changes in neuronal architecture. Our findings
   further indicate that Gtf2i haploinsufficiency plays an important role
   in the neurodevelopmental and cognitive abnormalities of WBS and that it
   is possible to rescue part of this neurocognitive phenotype by restoring
   Gtf2i expression levels in specific brain areas.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we will describe in quantitative terms the unspecific
   recognition between lactose permease (LacY) of Escherichia coli, a
   polytopic model membrane protein, and one of the main components of the
   inner membrane of this bacterium. Supported lipid bilayers of
   1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE) and
   1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPG) (3:1, mol/mol)
   in the presence of Ca2+ display lateral phase segregation that can be
   distinguished by atomic force microscopy (AFM) as well as force
   spectroscopy. LacY shows preference for fluid (L) phases when it is
   reconstituted in POPE:POPG (3:1, mol/mol) proteoliposomes at a
   lipid-to-protein ratio of 40. When the lipid-to-protein ratio is
   decreased down to 0.5, two domains can be distinguished by AFM. While
   the upper domain is formed by self-segregated units of LacY, the lower
   domain is constituted only by phospholipids in gel (L) phase. On the one
   hand, classical differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements
   evidenced the segregation of a population of phospholipids and point to
   the existence of a boundary region at the lipid-protein interface. On
   the other hand, Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) measurements in
   solution evidenced that POPE is selectively recognized by LacY. A binary
   pseudophase diagram of POPE:POPG built from AFM observations enables to
   calculate the composition of the fluid phase where LacY is inserted.
   These results are consistent with a model where POPE constitutes the
   main component of the lipid-LacY interface segregated from the fluid
   bulk phase where POPG predominates. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{The plant hormone jasmonate (JA) plays an important role in regulating
   growth, development, and immunity. Activation of the JA-signaling
   pathway is based on the hormone-triggered ubiquitination and removal of
   transcriptional repressors (JASMONATE-ZIM DOMAIN {[}JAZ] proteins) by an
   SCF receptor complex (SCFCOI1/JAZ). This removal allows the rapid
   activation of transcription factors (TFs) triggering a multitude of
   downstream responses. Identification of TFs bound by the JAZ proteins is
   essential to better understand how the JA-signaling pathway modulates
   and integrates different responses. In this study, we found that the
   JAZ3 repressor physically interacts with the YABBY (YAB) family
   transcription factor FILAMENTOUS FLOWER (FIL)/YAB1. In Arabidopsis
   thaliana, FIL regulates developmental processes such as axial patterning
   and growth of lateral organs, shoot apical meristem activity, and
   inflorescence phyllotaxy. Phenotypic analysis of JA-regulated responses
   in loss- and gain-of-function FIL lines suggested that YABs function as
   transcriptional activators of JA-triggered responses. Moreover, we show
   that MYB75, a component of the WD-repeat/bHLH/MYB complex regulating
   anthocyanin production, is a direct transcriptional target of FIL. We
   propose that JAZ3 interacts with YABs to attenuate their transcriptional
   function. Upon perception of JA signal, degradation of JAZ3 by the
   SCFCOI1 complex releases YABs to activate a subset of JA-regulated genes
   in leaves leading to anthocyanin accumulation, chlorophyll loss, and
   reduced bacterial defense.}},

Abstract = {{Protein turnover is essential in all living organisms for the
   maintenance of normal cell physiology. In eukaryotes, most cellular
   protein turnover involves the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, in which
   proteins tagged with ubiquitin are targeted to the proteasome for
   degradation. In contrast, most bacteria lack a proteasome but harbor
   proteases for protein turnover. However, some actinobacteria, such as
   mycobacteria, possess a proteasome in addition to these proteases. A
   prokaryotic ubiquitination-like tagging process in mycobacteria was
   described and was named pupylation: proteins are tagged with Pup
   (prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein) and directed to the proteasome for
   degradation. We report pupylation in another actinobacterium,
   Streptomyces coelicolor. Both the morphology and life cycle of
   Streptomyces species are complex (formation of a substrate and aerial
   mycelium followed by sporulation), and these bacteria are prolific
   producers of secondary metabolites with important medicinal and
   agricultural applications. The genes encoding the pupylation system in
   S. coelicolor are expressed at various stages of development. We
   demonstrated that pupylation targets numerous proteins and identified 20
   of them. Furthermore, we established that abolition of pupylation has
   substantial effects on morphological and metabolic differentiation and
   on resistance to oxidative stress. In contrast, in most cases, a
   proteasome-deficient mutant showed only modest perturbations under the
   same conditions. Thus, the phenotype of the pup mutant does not appear
   to be due solely to defective proteasomal degradation. Presumably,
   pupylation has roles in addition to directing proteins to the
   proteasome.
   IMPORTANCE
   Streptomyces spp. are filamentous and sporulating actinobacteria,
   remarkable for their morphological and metabolic differentiation. They
   produce numerous bioactive compounds, including antifungal, antibiotic,
   and antitumor compounds. There is therefore considerable interest in
   understanding the mechanisms by which Streptomyces species regulate
   their complex physiology and production of bioactive compounds. We
   studied the role in Streptomyces of pupylation, a posttranslational
   modification that tags proteins that are then directed to the proteasome
   for degradation. We demonstrated that the absence of pupylation had
   large effects on morphological differentiation, antibiotic production,
   and resistance to oxidative stress in S. coelicolor. The phenotypes of
   pupylation and proteasome-defective mutants differed and suggest that
   pupylation acts in a proteasome-independent manner in addition to its
   role in proteasomal degradation.}},

Abstract = {{The thermal drifts caused by the power dissipated by the mechanical
   guiding systems are the main limit on the accuracy of an ultrahigh
   precision cylindricity measuring machine. For this reason, a
   high-precision compact prototype, henceforth high-precision setup, has
   been designed to simulate the behavior of the cylindricity measurement
   machine. It uses in situ calibration of capacitive displacement probes
   by comparison with four laser interferometers. The setup includes three
   heating wires for simulating the powers dissipated by the mechanical
   guiding systems, 19 platinum resistance thermometers (Pt100) to measure
   temperature propagation inside the setup and four Pt100 sensors to
   monitor the ambient temperature. The calibration tests carried out under
   several different conditions reveal that residual errors of the
   capacitive probes are usually less than 5 nm. The simulation of the
   cylindricity measurements also indicates that the thermal expansion is a
   few nanometers.}},

Abstract = {{Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are
   noninvasive neuroimaging modalities. They are widely used and could be
   complementary. The fusion of these modalities may enhance some emerging
   research fields targeting the exploration better brain activities. Such
   research attracted various scientific investigators especially to
   provide a convivial and helpful advanced clinical-aid tool enabling
   better neurological explorations. Our present research was, in fact, in
   the context of EEG inverse problem resolution and investigated an
   advanced estimation methodology for the localization of the cerebral
   activity. Our focus was, therefore, on the integration of temporal
   priors to low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (LORETA)
   formalism and to solve the inverse problem in the EEG. The main idea
   behind our proposed method was in the integration of a temporal
   projection matrix within the LORETA weighting matrix. A hyperparameter
   is the principal fact for such a temporal integration, and its
   importance would be obvious when obtaining a regularized smoothness
   solution. Our experimental results clearly confirmed the impact of such
   an optimization procedure adopted for the temporal regularization
   parameter comparatively to the LORETA method. (C) 2015 SPIE and IS\&T}},

Abstract = {{Crinoid diversity and abundance was higher during the Early
   Carboniferous (Mississippian) than at any other time. Due to the
   systematic focus on more complete specimens of crinoids, some areas,
   like the White Peak of Derbyshire and Staffordshire, UK, have
   erroneously been considered poor in fossil crinoids. Indeed, cups and
   crowns have only rarely been found in this area, but many limestones and
   cherts from the White Peak are rich in disarticulated crinoid remains.
   Screwstones (=fossiliferous cherts) collected in Bradford Dale,
   Derbyshire, yielded the disarticulated stem fragments, preserved as
   natural moulds, of seven crinoid morphotaxa, which is more than half of
   the known species richness of the whole White Peak. Considering that the
   material studied herein came from one locality, it is thus probable that
   the diversity of Mississippian crinoids in the White Peak is somewhat
   higher than previously recognized. This study shows that disarticulated
   stem fragments can be used as a proxy to test the crinoid diversity of
   an area, and that with further study of not only cups and crowns, some
   areas preserve a diversity of crinoids that is more than previously
   known.}},

Title = {{The relationship between image degradation and myopia in the mammalian

Abstract = {{Background: In all species studied, myopia develops if the eye is
   deprived of detailed vision during development (form deprivation
   myopia). However, different degrees of spatial image deprivation produce
   different effects and have not been described in the mammalian eye.
   Therefore, the effect of image degradation on guinea pig emmetropisation
   was investigated.
   Methods: Eighty-one guinea pigs wore a treatment on one eye from 6 to 13
   days of age. There were four treatments: a translucent diffuser (no
   lines or edges were visible through the diffuser); one of five Bangerter
   foils (BF: 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2, light perception only), which differed in
   their cut-off spatial frequencies; a `ring mount' control with no
   filter; or one of two neutral density filters that reduced luminance
   only (ND, optical density grades 0.1 and 0.6). Refractive error and
   ocular elongation were measured after seven days of treatment.
   Results: The extent of induced myopia and ocular growth were related to
   the amount of image degradation (mean difference between the treated and
   untreated eyes changed in a graded manner -7.0 D to -0.2 D and from 85
   mu m to seven mu m respectively, for spatial frequency cut-offs between
   zero and 24 cycles per degree). Corresponding reductions in luminance
   from ND filters did not increase eye growth and caused significantly
   less myopia than the BFs that caused a similar luminance decrement. The
   greatest myopia occurred when no or limited spatial information was
   available to the eye, but moderate myopia still occurred with spatial
   frequency cut-offs of six and 12 cycles per degree, well beyond the
   visual acuity range of guinea pigs.
   Conclusion: Excessive ocular growth and myopia are most robust when
   induced by spatial frequency reductions within the visual acuity range
   but can also be induced beyond this. Either the mechanism of ocular
   growth can detect supra-threshold spatial frequencies, possibly due to
   aliasing, or it is sensitive to small amounts of contrast degradation.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Pulmonary hypertension is a common finding in chronic liver
   disease patients that has prognostic significance. In this study, we
   aimed to evaluate the prevalence and severity of pulmonary hypertension
   in patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplant. We also evaluated
   pulmonary artery pressure changes after transplant surgery.
   Materials and Methods: The records of adult patients with chronic liver
   disease who underwent orthotopic liver transplant at our center between
   2004 and 2015 were retrospectively evaluated. Clinical and demographic
   variables and laboratory data were noted. Transthoracic Doppler echo
   cardiographic examination reports were obtained. Using continuous-wave
   Doppler examination, systolic pulmonary artery pressure values were
   calculated. Pulmonary hypertension was defined as systolic pulmonary
   artery pressure >= 30 mm Hg. Among 208 adult patients who underwent
   orthotopic liver transplant, 203 who had Doppler echocardiographic
   examination were enrolled.
   Results: The mean age of patients was 42.1 +/- 14.1 years (range, 16-67
   y), and 143 (70.4\%) were men. During preoperative assessment, pulmonary
   hypertension was identified in 47 patients (23.2\%), of whom 10
   displayed systolic pulmonary artery pressure > 50 mm Hg. Compared with
   preoperative values of systolic pulmonary artery pressure (46.8 +/- 8.4
   mm Hg), a significant reduction in mean values (to 39.3 +/- 13.3 mm Hg)
   was observed post operatively (P=.007).
   Conclusions: The findings of this study indicate that pulmonary
   hypertension is a common finding in adult chronic liver disease patients
   undergoing orthotopic liver transplant. A significant improve ment
   occurs in systolic pulmonary artery pressure values following transplant
   surgery. Regarding the prevalence and prognostic significance of
   pulmonary hypertension, all patients with chronic liver disease should
   be evaluated with transthoracic Doppler echocardiography before
   transplant.}},

Abstract = {{Sixty dogs from a Yukpa ethnic community at Sierra de Perija in western
   Venezuela were serologically evaluated to detect infection by
   Trypanosoma cruzi. Infections detected in intra and extradomiciliary
   dogs were compared, and their relationships with epidemiological
   variables, such as age, sex, and housing conditions, were established.
   The use of two serological tests, the direct agglutination test (DAT)
   and the immuno-fluorescent antibody test (IFAT), revealed circulating
   anti-T. cruzi antibodies in 63\% (38/60) of sera samples from evaluated
   dogs, showing agreement between the two diagnostic tests. In addition,
   the recorded anti-T. cruzi antibody titres ranged from 128 to 4096 and
   from 64 to 512 for DAT and IFAT, respectively. Statistical analysis
   revealed significant differences (P<0.05) when T. cruzi seropositivity
   between extradomiciliary (35\%) and intradomiciliary (28\%) dogs were
   compared. However, no significant differences (P>0.05) among T. cruzi
   sero-infection in dogs and other epidemiological variables were
   detected. The relatively high seroprevalence in the evaluated dogs
   suggest an important role played by these animals in the maintenance of
   T. cruzi circulation in the locality, which may be considered a
   potential risk factor for the endemic establishment of Chagas disease at
   the Yukpa ethnic community at the Sierra de Perija.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Understanding how young girls respond to growing up with
   breast cancer family histories is critical given expansion of genetic
   testing and breast cancer messaging. We examined the impact of breast
   cancer family history on psychosocial adjustment and health behaviors
   among >800 girls in the multicenter LEGACY Girls Study.
   METHODS: Girls aged 6 to 13 years with a family history of breast cancer
   or familial BRCA1/2 mutation (BCFH+), peers without a family history
   (BCFH-), and their biological mothers completed assessments of
   psychosocial adjustment (maternal report for 6- to 13-year-olds,
   self-report for 10- to 13-year-olds), breast cancer-specific distress,
   perceived risk of breast cancer, and health behaviors (10- to
   13-year-olds).
   RESULTS: BCFH+ girls had better general psychosocial adjustment than
   BCFH-peers by maternal report. Psychosocial adjustment and health
   behaviors did not differ significantly by self-report among 10- to
   13-year-old girls. BCFH+ girls reported higher breast cancer-specific
   distress (P = .001) and were more likely to report themselves at
   increased breast cancer risk than BCFH-peers (38.4\% vs 13.7\%, P <
   .001), although many girls were unsure of their risk. In multivariable
   analyses, higher daughter anxiety was associated with higher maternal
   anxiety and poorer family communication. Higher daughter breast
   cancer-specific distress was associated with higher maternal breast
   cancer-specific distress.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although growing up in a family at risk for breast cancer
   does not negatively affect general psychosocial adjustment among
   preadolescent girls, those from breast cancer risk families experience
   greater breast cancer-specific distress. Interventions to address
   daughter and mother breast cancer concerns and responses to genetic or
   familial risk might improve psychosocial outcomes of teen daughters.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to interact with priority
   pollutants is crucial for efficient water treatment by photocatalytic
   advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). However, background compounds in
   water such as natural organic matter (NOM) can significantly hinder
   targeted reactions and removal efficiency. This inhibition can be
   complex, interfering with degradation in solution and at the
   photocatalyst surface as well as hindering illumination efficiency and
   ROS production. We developed an analytical model to account for various
   inhibition mechanisms in catalytic AOPs, including competitive
   adsorption of inhibitors, scavenging of produced ROS at the surface and
   in solution, and the inner filtering of the excitation illumination,
   which combine to decrease ROS-mediated degradation. This model was
   validated with batch experiments using a variety of ROS producing
   systems ((OH)-O-center dot-generating TiO2 photocatalyst and H2O2-UV;
   O-1(2)-generating photosensitive functionalized fullerenes and rose
   bengal) and inhibitory compounds (NOM, tert-butyl alcohol). Competitive
   adsorption by NOM and ROS scavenging were the most influential
   inhibitory mechanisms. Overall, this model enables accurate simulation
   of photocatalytic AOP performance when one or more inhibitory mechanisms
   are at work in a wide variety of application scenarios, and underscores
   the need to consider the effects of background constituents on
   degradation efficiency. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In transparent orthographies like German, isolated learning disabilities
   in either reading or spelling are common and occur as often as a
   combined reading and spelling disability. However, most issues
   surrounding the cognitive causes of these isolated or combined literacy
   difficulties are yet unresolved. Recently, working memory dysfunctions
   have been demonstrated to be promising in explaining the emergence of
   literacy difficulties. Thus, we applied a 2 (reading disability: yes vs.
   no) x 2 (spelling disability: yes vs. no) factorial design to examine
   distinct and overlapping working memory profiles associated with
   learning disabilities in reading versus spelling. Working memory was
   assessed in 204 third graders, and multivariate analyses of variance
   were conducted for each working memory component. Children with spelling
   disability suffered from more pronounced phonological loop impairments
   than those with reading disability. In contrast, domain-general
   central-executive dysfunctions were solely associated with reading
   disability, but not with spelling disability. Concerning the
   visuospatial sketchpad, no impairments were found. In sum, children with
   reading disability and those with spelling disability seem to be
   characterized by different working memory profiles. Thus, it is
   important to take both reading and spelling into account when
   investigating cognitive factors of literacy difficulties in transparent
   orthographies.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The paper analyzes the robustness of stable volatility strategies, i.e.
   strategies in which the portfolio weight of the stock is inversely
   proportional to its local volatility. These strategies are optimal for a
   CRRA investor if the stock follows a diffusion process, the expected
   excess return is proportional to its volatility, and the hedging demand
   is zero. We assess the performance of stable volatility strategies when
   these restrictive assumptions do not hold, in particular, when the risk
   premium is not proportional to volatility and when the stock price is
   subject to jumps. We find that stable volatility strategies are indeed
   robust or close to robust under a maxmin decision rule. In addition to
   our theoretical results, we perform a simulation analysis to evaluate
   strategies that scale the portfolio weight by the volatility, variance
   or a constant portfolio weight, and also analyze the strategies using
   empirical excess returns. Both analyses confirm the robustness of stable
   volatility strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLINICAL VIROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{55-59}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Torque teno virus (TTV) is a small virus belongs to
   Anelloviridea family. TTV is a disease orphan virus but it has often
   been associated with a variety of pathologies and co-infections. TTV was
   recently identified as an infectious agent that could potentially be
   involved in cases of acute enteritis.
   Objectives: To ascertain the presence of TTV in stools from diarrheic
   and not diarrheic people, and to investigate an association between
   infection, and patient age and gender.
   Study design: Stool samples from people exhibiting signs of enteritis
   (954) and from non-diarrheic individuals (76) were collected in the
   former Chinook Health Region (CHR) in Southwestern Alberta, Canada from
   May 2008 to April 2009. Viral genetic material was extracted, and
   detection and quantification of TTV were carried out by real-time PCR.
   The presence of other viral and bacterial enteric pathogens was also
   investigated.
   Results: More (13< 0.001) diarrheic people (38.8\%) tested positive for
   TTV DNA than non-diarrheic individuals (18.4\%). Furthermore, viral load
   was greater (P<0.001) in stools from diarrheic (2.0 x 107 copies/g) than
   non-diarrheic (2.0 x 103 copies/g) people. TTV DNA was detected most
   often in diarrheic individuals that were 0-5 (57.3\%) and greater than
   81(59.0\%) years of age. Combined across age, the prevalence of TTV was
   higher among men than women (P=0.003). Co-infections with other enteric
   pathogens were observed.
   Conclusions: This study revealed a significant association between TTV
   prevalence and viral load, and enteritis. Also, TTV prevalence was
   significantly higher in the very young and elderly suggesting that
   immunological status is important. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by

Abstract = {{Purpose To measure changes in upper limb work and power capacity before
   and after anterior scalene muscle block (ASMB) to suggest thoracic
   outlet syndrome caused by costoclavicular space compression.
   Methods We evaluated 34 patients disabled by symptoms suggesting
   thoracic outlet syndrome. An ASMB. was performed via a supraclavicular
   injection. The sternocleidomastoid muscle was injected as a control. We
   captured data obtained from work simulator measurements before and after
   ASMB. Each patient performed a push pull test with the forearm at waist
   level (test 1), an overhead bar push pull test with the arm elevated
   (test 2), and the extremity abduction stress test with repetitive hand
   gripping during static arm elevation (test 3). We measured the work
   product, time to fatigue, and power generation. Sensory testing was
   performed after ASMB to rule out improved performance associated With
   possible sensory nerve block.
   Results In contrast to sternocleidomastoid injection controls,
   symptomatic and functional improvement was noted in all patients (n =
   34) after ASMB. Work product measurement improved 93\%, 108\%, and 104\%
   for tests 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Time to fatigue and power output
   also increased after the block.
   Conclusions Temporary symptomatic improvement after ASMB may be
   anticipated in patients with TOS. This study documents a significant
   concurrent increase in upper limb motor function after the block.
   Increased work and power measurements after ASMB may draw diagnostic
   inference regarding a dynamic change in the scalene muscle and the
   costoclavicular space associated with symptomatic thoracic outlet
   syndrome. (Copyright (C) 2015 by the American Society for Surgery of the

Abstract = {{Our aim was to adapt the traditional framework for expected net benefit
   of sampling (ENBS) to be more compatible with drug development trials
   from the pharmaceutical perspective. We modify the traditional framework
   for conducting ENBS and assume that the price of the drug is conditional
   on the trial outcomes. We use a value-based pricing (VBP) criterion to
   determine price conditional on trial data using Bayesian updating of
   cost-effectiveness (CE) model parameters. We assume that there is a
   threshold price below which the company would not market the new
   intervention. We present a case study in which a phase III trial sample
   size and trial duration are varied. For each trial design, we sampled
   10000 trial outcomes and estimated VBP using a CE model. The expected
   commercial net benefit is calculated as the expected profits minus the
   trial costs. A clinical trial with shorter follow-up, and larger sample
   size, generated the greatest expected commercial net benefit. Increasing
   the duration of follow-up had a modest impact on profit forecasts.
   Expected net benefit of sampling can be adapted to value clinical trials
   in the pharmaceutical industry to optimise the expected commercial net
   benefit. However, the analyses can be very time consuming for complex CE
   models. (c) 2014 The Authors. Health Economics published by John Wiley

Abstract = {{In this paper a nonparametric approach for estimating mixed-frequency
   forecast equations is proposed. In contrast to the popular MIDAS
   approach that employs an (exponential) Almon or Beta lag distribution,
   we adopt a penalized least-squares estimator that imposes some degree of
   smoothness to the lag distribution. This estimator is related to
   nonparametric estimation procedures based on cubic splines and resembles
   the popular Hodrick-Prescott filtering technique for estimating a smooth
   trend function. Monte Carlo experiments suggest that the nonparametric
   estimator may provide more reliable and flexible approximations to the
   actual lag distribution than the conventional parametric MIDAS approach
   based on exponential lag polynomials. Parametric and nonparametric
   methods are applied to assess the predictive power of various daily
   indicators for forecasting monthly inflation rates. It turns out that
   the commodity price index is a useful predictor for inflations rates
   20-30 days ahead with a hump-shaped lag distribution. Copyright (c) 2015

Abstract = {{In a set of human experiments, we analyze the impact of the buyer's
   reserve price policy in an online open outcry reverse auction. We
   measure the impact of revealing or not the reserve price on the buyer's
   expected cost when suppliers may be risk-averse. Results confirm that
   the optimal public reserve price policy dominates for the buyer when the
   lowest cost supplier is weakly risk-averse but in contrast with theory,
   the secret reserve price policy does not dominate when he becomes very
   risk-averse. Analysis of strategic suppliers' bidding behavior shows, in
   conformity with theory, that they react to the secret reserve price and
   are more aggressive when they are more risk-averse. This explains why
   the optimal public reserve price does not perform better in this context
   but is equivalent to the secret one. However, strongly risk-averse
   bidders are less aggressive than predicted by theory. That is why the
   secret reserve price policy does not strictly dominate. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{We present a theoretical study of the gain characteristics of
   GaBixAs1-x/(Al)GaAs dilute bismide quantum well (QW) lasers. After
   providing a brief overview of the current state of development of dilute
   bismide alloys for semiconductor laser applications, we introduce the
   theoretical model we have developed for the description of the
   electronic and optical properties of dilute bismide QWs. Using a
   theoretical approach based on a 12-band k.p Hamiltonian we then
   undertake a detailed analysis of the electronic and optical properties
   of a series of ideal and real GaBixAs1-x/(Al)GaAs QW laser structures as
   a function of Bi composition x. We theoretically optimize the gain
   characteristics of an existing low x device by varying the Al
   composition in the barrier layers, which governs a trade-off between the
   electronic and optical confinement. The theoretical results are compared
   to temperature-dependent spontaneous emission measurements at low x,
   which reveals the presence of significant Bi-induced inhomogeneous
   broadening of the optical spectra. We also investigate the gain
   characteristics of GaBixAs1-x/(Al) GaAs QW lasers at higher values of x,
   including a QW designed to emit at 1.55 mu m. Our theoretical results
   elucidate the impact of Bi incorporation on the electronic and optical
   properties of GaAs-based QW lasers, and reveal several general trends in
   the gain characteristics as a function of x. Overall, our analysis
   confirms that dilute bismide alloys are a promising candidate material
   system for the development of highly efficient, uncooled GaAs-based QW
   lasers operating at telecommunication wavelengths.}},

Abstract = {{Creasing in soft polymeric films is a result of substantial compressive
   stresses that trigger instability beyond a critical strain and have been
   directly related to failure mechanisms in different materials. However,
   it has been shown that programming these instabilities into soft
   materials can lead to new applications, such as particle sorting,
   deformable capillaries, and stimuli-responsive interfaces. In this work,
   we present a method for fabricating reproducible nanoscale surface
   instabilities using reactive microcontacting printing (mu CP) on
   activated ester polymer brush layers of poly(pentafluorophenyl
   acrylate). The sizes and structures of the nanoscale creases can be
   modulated by varying the grafting density of the brush substrate and
   pressure applied during mu CP. Stress is generated in the film under
   confinement due to the molecular weight increase of the side chains
   during post-polymerization modification, which results in substantial
   in-plane growth in the film and leads to the observed nanoscale creases.}},

Abstract = {{Single layers of chalcogenide semiconductors have demonstrated to
   exhibit tunable properties that can be exploited for new field-effect
   transistors and photonic devices. Among these semiconductors, indium
   selenide (InSe) is attractive for applications due to its direct bandgap
   in the near infrared, controllable p-and n-type doping and high chemical
   stability. For its fundamental study and the development of practical
   applications, rapid and accurate identification methods of atomically
   thin nanosheets are essential. Here, we employ a transfer matrix
   approach to numerically calculate the optical contrast between thin InSe
   flakes and commonly used SiO2/Si substrates, which nicely reproduces
   experimental values extracted from optical images on 285 nm SiO2/Si
   substrates. Standard 90 and similar to 300 nm SiO2/Si substrates result
   to provide an optimized optical contrast to detect few-layer InSe flakes
   using monochromatic illumination at similar to 450 and similar to 520
   nm, respectively. On the other hand, calculated optical contrast reveals
   an optimum value of 110 nm for the thickness of the SiO2 film on Si
   substrates in order to detect InSe nanoflakes as thin as one single
   layer, under white light illumination. These results demonstrate that
   the proposed optical contrast method is a very fast and reliable
   technique to identify atomically thin InSe nanoflakes deposited onto
   SiO2/Si substrates. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{It has been reported that a directional change from anoxic to aerobic
   conditions is a common trigger for nitrous oxide (N2O) production by
   ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB). By extension, during anoxic-aerobic
   cycling, post-anoxic dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations might likely
   play a role in the magnitude of N2O emissions observed. The overall goal
   of this study was to determine the impact of three select post-anoxic DO
   concentrations (0.8, 2.0, and 3.0mg O-2/L) on N2O emissions from
   partial-nitrification (PN) and full-nitrification (FN) reactors
   subjected to anoxic-aerobic cycling and, ultimately, to explore the
   development of strategies to minimize N2O emissions from PN and FN based
   biological nitrogen removal (BNR) processes. Statistically similar N2O
   emissions were observed during anoxia for both PN (0.62 +/- 0.21\% N
   load) and FN (0.61 +/- 0.070\% N load) processes. In contrast, N2O
   emissions were statistically lower for PN (0.86 +/- 0.25\% N load) than
   for FN (4.6 +/- 2.8\% N load), during the post-anoxic aerobic phase,
   when compared together for all three post-anoxic DO concentrations.
   Further, for PN, the highest N2O emissions were observed at the highest
   post-anoxic DO concentration of 3.0mg O-2/L (1.2\%N load), likely due to
   the highest corresponding AOB specific growth rate. In contrast, for FN,
   the highest N2O emissions were at the lowest post-anoxic DO
   concentration of 0.8mg O-2/L (8.5\%N load). The higher emissions from FN
   process at low DO concentrations were associated with a lag in nitrite
   oxidizing bacteria activity upon recovery to aerobic conditions. This
   lag phase contributed to transient nitrite accumulation, and in turn
   correlated positively to the observed N2O emissions. Based on our
   findings, a gradual ramp up in post-anoxic DO concentrations can
   minimize N2O emissions during PN-based BNR, whereas a completely
   different strategy, entailing a rapid increase in post-anoxic DO
   concentrations can minimize emissions during FN-based BNR operations.

Volume = {{6}},

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{The initiation of DNA replication is a highly regulated event in
   eukaryotic cells to ensure that the entire genome is copied once and
   only once during S phase. The primary target of cellular regulation of
   eukaryotic DNA replication initiation is the assembly and activation of
   the replication fork helicase, the 11-subunit assembly that unwinds DNA
   at a replication fork. The replication fork helicase, called CMG for
   Cdc45-Mcm2-7, and GINS, assembles in S phase from the constituent Cdc45,
   Mcm2-7, and GINS proteins. The assembly and activation of the CMG
   replication fork helicase during S phase is governed by 2 S-phase
   specific kinases, CDK and DDK. CDK stimulates the interaction between
   Sld2, Sld3, and Dpb11, 3 initiation factors that are each required for
   the initiation of DNA replication. DDK, on the other hand,
   phosphorylates the Mcm2, Mcm4, and Mcm6 subunits of the Mcm2-7 complex.
   Sld3 recruits Cdc45 to Mcm2-7 in a manner that depends on DDK, and
   recent work suggests that Sld3 binds directly to Mcm2-7 and also to
   single-stranded DNA. Furthermore, recent work demonstrates that Sld3 and
   its human homolog Treslin substantially stimulate DDK phosphorylation of
   Mcm2. These data suggest that the initiation factor Sld3/Treslin
   coordinates the assembly and activation of the eukaryotic replication
   fork helicase by recruiting Cdc45 to Mcm2-7, stimulating DDK
   phosphorylation of Mcm2, and binding directly to single-stranded DNA as
   the origin is melted.}},

Abstract = {{The emerging field of in situ tissue engineering (TE) of load bearing
   tissues places high demands on the implanted scaffolds, as these
   scaffolds should provide mechanical stability immediately upon
   implantation. The new class of synthetic supramolecular biomaterial
   polymers, which contain non-covalent interactions between the polymer
   chains, thereby forming complex 3D structures by self assembly. Here, we
   have aimed to map the degradation characteristics of promising
   (supramolecular) materials, by using a combination of in vitro tests.
   The selected biomaterials were all polycaprolactones (PCLs), either
   conventional and unmodified PCL, or PCL with supramolecular hydrogen
   bonding moieties (either 2-ureido-{[}1H]-pyrimidin-4-one or bis-urea
   units) incorporated into the backbone. As these materials are
   elastomeric, they are suitable candidates for cardiovascular TB
   applications. Electrospun scaffold strips of these materials were
   incubated with solutions containing enzymes that catalyze hydrolysis, or
   solutions containing oxidative species. At several time points,
   chemical, morphological, and mechanical properties were investigated. It
   was demonstrated that conventional and supramolecular PCL-based polymers
   respond differently to enzyme-accelerated hydrolytic or oxidative
   degradation, depending on the morphological and chemical composition of
   the material. Conventional PCL is more prone to hydrolytic enzymatic
   degradation as compared to the investigated supramolecular materials,
   while, in contrast, the latter materials are more susceptible to
   oxidative degradation. Given the observed degradation pathways of the
   examined materials, we are able to tailor degradation characteristics by
   combining selected PCL backbones with additional supramolecular
   moieties. The presented combination of in vitro test methods can be
   employed to screen, limit, and select biomaterials for pre-clinical in
   vivo studies targeted to different clinical applications. (C) 2015 Acta

   these behaviors also may serve social functions. Given the unsettled
   debate, functional behavior assessment and functional analysis can be
   used to identify the exact function of stereotypical behavior and design
   an intervention matched to that function. In these two studies, we
   conducted functional behavior assessments on two high school students
   exhibiting stereotypical behaviors. Although the students' behaviors
   were topographically and functionally different, function-based
   interventions appeared effective in reducing these behaviors for both
   students. Key findings and limitations are discussed for each study, and
   a general discussion across studies is provided.}},

Abstract = {{Besides the warming of the ocean, sea level is mainly rising due to land
   ice mass loss of the major ice sheets in Greenland, the West Antarctic,
   and the Alaskan Glaciers. However, it is not clear yet how these land
   ice mass losses influence regional sea level. Here, we use the global
   Finite Element Sea-ice Ocean Model (FESOM) to simulate sea surface
   height (SSH) changes caused by these ice mass losses and combine it with
   the passive ocean response to varying surface loading using the sea
   level equation. We prescribe rates of fresh water inflow, not only
   around Greenland, but also around the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and the
   mountain glaciers in Alaska with approximately present-day amplitudes of
   200, 100, and 50 Gt/yr, respectively. Perturbations in sea level and in
   freshwater distribution with respect to a reference simulation are
   computed for each source separately and in their combination. The ocean
   mass change shows an almost globally uniform behavior. In the North
   Atlantic and Arctic Ocean, mass is redistributed toward coastal regions.
   Steric sea level change varies locally in the order of several
   centimeters on advective time-scales of decades. Steric effects to local
   sea level differ significantly in different coastal locations, e.g., at
   North American coastal regions the steric effects may have the same
   order of magnitude as the mass driven effect, whereas at the European
   coast, steric effects remain small during the simulation period.}},

Abstract = {{The study analysed the effect of low-concentrated acidic electrolysed
   water (LCAEW) treatment on meat. Microbiological analysis and colour and
   sensory quality testing during storage were performed on Longissimus
   thoracis. FT-IR and FT-Raman spectroscopy were used to detect eventual
   changes in the structure of meat after treatment. Meat samples were
   sprayed for 120s with LCAEW (0.001\%, 0.01\% or 0.1\% NaCl solution were
   electrolysed for 0, 5 or 10min). The highest reduction in total number
   of micro-organisms (3.25 log reduction), yeast and moulds (2.68 log
   reduction) and psychrotrophs (3.10 log reduction) was observed after
   spraying the meat samples with 0.1\% NaCl electrolysed for 10min. LCAEW
   caused a decrease in deoxymyoglobin and metmyoglobin concentration in
   unstored meat samples. The preliminary sensory studies proved that
   colour changes are not significant for consumers. The IR and Raman
   spectra indicate that the structure of compounds of meat tissues are not
   affected by chlorine and chlorine compounds (LCAEW components). LCAEW
   has no influence on denaturation of meat protein.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: As an aging population continues to place strain on the
   health care system, many older adults are living with unmet social and
   medical needs. In response, Emergency Medical Services (EMS) have
   initiated programs that encourage paramedics to refer patients in need
   to community based support services. This qualitative study explores
   frontline paramedic experiences with referral programs to identify
   opportunities and challenges in their practice.
   Methods: This study used an intepretivist qualitative study design
   involving interviews of frontline paramedics employed in a region where
   referral programs were in place. Interviews were semi-structured and
   one-on-one. Data were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using inductive
   open coding throughout, then grouped to identify themes. Data collection
   and analysis were conducted simultaneously and flexibly until
   saturation.
   Results: Twenty-three interviews were conducted representing 6 regions.
   When participating with referral programs the data revealed that
   frontline paramedics appear to experience (a) role confusion, (b) an
   inadequate knowledge base, (c) inadequate feedback, (d) undefined
   accountability, and (e) strong patient advocacy.
   Conclusions: In a strained health care system, EMS and paramedics have
   an opportunity to better serve patients by initiating referrals for
   patients they encounter with unmet social and medical needs. However,
   referral programs face a number of challenges that, if left poorly
   addressed, may threaten the success of such programs.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with
   cognitive decline, but the molecular link between COPD and dementia or
   Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. This study was aimed to
   investigate whether serum A beta levels are correlated with COPD. 77
   cognitively normal COPD patients and 45 age- and gender-matched normal
   controls were admitted to the study. Serum A beta 40 and A beta 42
   levels were measured using ELISA kits. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP),
   interleukin 6 (IL-6), and procalcitonin (PCT) measurements were done
   using standard laboratory methods. Pulmonary function tests were
   performed to assess the pulmonary function and determine the degree of
   lung damage. Significantly increased levels of serum A beta 40, A beta
   42, and total A beta levels were found in patients with COPD in
   comparison with normal controls. In COPD patients, serum A beta levels
   were higher in subjects with serum CRP, IL-6, and PCT upper the limit of
   normal. Moreover, serum A beta levels were dramatically higher in COPD
   patients with worse pulmonary function. Our study suggests that
   cognitively normal COPD patients may undergo AD-related pathological
   changes, and COPD might facilitate AD-type pathogenesis.}},

Journal = {{PRAVENTION UND GESUNDHEITSFORDERUNG}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{275-280}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background. Daily life in today's society is often dominated by
   sedentary pursuits; therefore, only low energy expenditure is necessary
   to fulfill the daily tasks and duties with tremendous consequences for
   the health of the population. The interventions which are best suited to
   reduce daily sitting times are controversially discussed.
   Purpose and methods. The objective of this article is to illustrate from
   an empirical and conceptual point of view that besides the promotion of
   health-enhancing physical activity, it is necessary to develop discreet
   interventions to reduce sedentary behavior. Reducing sitting time is not
   the same as the promotion of moderate and vigorous intense (i.e.
   health-enhancing) physical activity. The presented facts and figures are
   based on a selective collection of current reviews or of currently
   available primary studies if no reviews exist. The studies included are
   primarily limited to adults.
   Results and discussion. The need to reduce sedentary time is high as the
   prevalence of prolonged sitting is extremely high in today's society and
   a reduction of sedentary behavior is linked to better health. From an
   empirical and conceptual point of view physical activity interventions
   do not necessarily contribute to a substantial reduction in sedentary
   behavior. For this purpose specific interventions directly focused on
   reducing or interrupting prolonged sitting times by light intense
   physical activities are a priority; therefore, prevention and health
   promotion should use a dual strategy by reducing the time spent sitting
   and by promoting moderate to vigorous physical activity.}},

Title = {{The multimodal majority? Driving, walking, cycling, and public
   transportation use among American adults}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Multimodality, the use of more than one mode of transportation during a
   specified time period, is gaining recognition as an important mechanism
   for reducing automobile dependence by shifting trips from automobiles to
   walking, cycling, or public transportation. Most prior research on
   multimodality focuses on Western European countries. Based on the 2001
   and 2009 National Household Travel Surveys, this paper analyzes trends
   and determinants of multimodal car use in the U.S. during a typical week
   by distinguishing between (1) monomodal car users who drive or ride in a
   car for all trips, (2) multimodal car users who drive or ride in a car
   and also use non-automobile modes, and (3) individuals who exclusively
   walk, cycle, and/or ride public transportation. We find that during a
   typical week a majority-almost two thirds-of Americans use a car and
   make at least one trip by foot, bicycle, or public transportation. One
   in four Americans uses a car and makes at least seven weekly trips by
   other modes of transportation. Results from multinomial and logistic
   regression analyses suggest there may be a continuum of mobility types
   ranging from monomodal car users to walk, bicycle, and/or public
   transportation only users-with multimodal car users positioned
   in-between the two extremes. Policy changes aimed at curtailing car use
   may result in movements along this spectrum with increasing
   multimodality for car users.}},

Abstract = {{We report on annual parallax and proper motion observations of H2O
   masers in S235AB-MIR, which is a massive young stellar object in the
   Perseus Arm. Using multi-epoch VLBI (very long baseline interferometry)
   astrometry we measured a parallax of pi = 0.63 +/- 0.03 mas,
   corresponding to a trigonometric distance of D = 1.56(-0.08)(+0.09) kpc,
   and source proper motion of (mu(alpha)cos delta, mu(delta)) = (0.79 +/-
   0.12, -2.41 +/- 0.14) mas yr(-1). Water masers trace a jet of diameter
   15 au which exhibits a definite radial velocity gradient perpendicular
   to its axis. 3D maser kinematics were well modelled by a rotating
   cylinder with physical parameters: v(out) = 45 +/- 2 km s(-1), v(rot) =
   22 +/- 3 km s(-1), i = 12 degrees +/- 2 degrees, which are the outflow
   velocity, tangential rotation velocity and line-of-sight inclination,
   respectively. One maser feature exhibited steady acceleration which may
   be related to the jet rotation. During our 15-month VLBI programme there
   were three `maser burst' events caught `in the act' which were caused by
   the overlapping of masers along the line of sight.}},

Abstract = {{Wild boar (Sus scrofa) rooting activities may affect several taxonomic
   groups. In hardwood forests, wild boar's diet is predominantly
   represented by plants of the ground layer. We here report a study
   conducted in two Mediterranean lowland forests in central Italy (the
   State Reserve of Castelporziano and the Circeo National Park). The aim
   of our study was to evaluate whether contrasting levels of rooting (high
   vs. low) determine different understorey species composition and
   diversity. Our results show that different rooting levels determine
   strong differences in the understorey composition. Furthermore, we found
   that the occurrence of different species (e.g. Ruscus aculeatus) was
   associated with contrasting rooting levels. Mediterranean species were
   significantly more frequent in plots with high levels of rooting. Plots
   sampled in the Castelporziano area were also characterised by species
   adapted to frequent disturbance and anthropogenic influence (e.g.
   Piptatherum miliaceum, Conyza albida); whereas species associated to
   low-rooting plots were typically related to deciduous forests. We found
   non-significant differences in diversity indices. This study
   demonstrates that wild boar activities cause substantial alterations in
   plant communities and underscores the need for long-term exclosure
   experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with defects of synaptic
   connectivity. Such defects may not be restricted to local neuronal
   interactions but may extend to long-range brain activities, such as
   slow-wave oscillations that are particularly prominent during non rapid
   eye movement (non-REM) sleep and are important for integration of
   information across distant brain regions involved in memory
   consolidation. There is increasing evidence that sleep is often impaired
   in AD, but it is unclear whether this impairment is directly related to
   amyloid-beta (A beta) pathology. Here we demonstrate that slow-wave
   activity is severely altered in the neocortex, thalamus and hippocampus
   in mouse models of AD amyloidosis. Most notably, our results reveal an A
   beta-dependent impairment of slow-wave propagation, which causes a
   breakdown of the characteristic long-range coherence of slow-wave
   activity. The finding that the impairment can be rescued by enhancing
   GABA(A)ergic inhibition identifies a synaptic mechanism underlying A
   beta-dependent large-scale circuit dysfunction.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a common

   patients and 788 normotensive controls were recruited for this study.
   Genotyping of the MPO gene polymorphism was done using TaqMan-based
   assay. A genotype -463GA was associated with decreased risk of EH (odds
   ratio = 0.82; 95\% confidence interval: 0.68-1.00) at a borderline
   significance level (P = .05). The gender-stratified analysis showed that
   a carriage of the -463GA and -463AA genotypes is associated with
   decreased EH risk only in females (odds ratio = 0.74, 95\% confidence
   interval: 0.56-0.96; P = .02). To the best of our knowledge, this is the

Abstract = {{AimTo evaluate the influence of examiner's clinical experience on
   detection and treatment decision of caries lesions in primary molars.
   DesignThree experienced dentists (Group A) and three undergraduate
   students (Group B) used the International Caries Detection and
   Assessment System (ICDAS) criteria and bitewing radiographs (BW) to
   perform examinations twice in 77 primary molars that presented a sound
   or carious occlusal surface. For the treatment decision (TD), the
   examiners attributed scores, analyzing the teeth in conjunction with the
   radiographs. The presence and the depth of lesion were validated
   histologically, and reproducibility was evaluated. The sensitivity,
   specificity, accuracy, and area under the ROC curve values were
   calculated for ICDAS and BW. The associations between ICDAS, BW, and TD
   were analyzed by means of contingency tables.
   ResultsInterexaminer agreement for ICDAS, BW, and TD were excellent for
   Group B and moderate for Group A. The two groups presented similar and
   satisfactory performance for caries lesion detection using ICDAS and BW.
   In the treatment decision, Group A was shown to have a less invasive
   approach than Group B.
   ConclusionThe examiner's experience was not determinant for the clinical
   and radiographic detection of occlusal lesions in primary teeth but
   influenced the treatment decision of initial lesions.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of vibration therapy on the bone
   callus of fractured femurs and the bone quality of intact femurs in
   ovariectomized rats.
   METHODS: Fifty-six rats aged seven weeks were divided into four groups:
   control with femoral fracture (CON, n=14), ovariectomized with femoral
   fracture (OVX, n=14), control with femoral fracture plus vibration
   therapy (CON+ VT, n=14), and ovariectomized with femoral fracture plus
   vibration therapy (OVX+VT, n=14). Three months after ovariectomy or sham
   surgery, a complete fracture was produced at the femoral mid-diaphysis
   and stabilized with a 1-mm-diameter intramedullary Kirschner wire.
   X-rays confirmed the fracture alignment and fixation. Three days later,
   the VT groups underwent vibration therapy (1 mm, 60 Hz for 20 minutes,
   three times per week for 14 or 28 days). The bone and callus quality
   were assessed by densitometry, three-dimensional microstructure, and
   mechanical test.
   RESULTS: Ovariectomized rats exhibited a substantial loss of bone mass
   and severe impairment in bone microarchitecture, both in the
   non-fractured femur and the bone callus. Whole-body vibration therapy
   exerted an important role in ameliorating the bone and fracture callus
   parameters in the osteoporotic bone.
   CONCLUSION: Vibration therapy improved bone quality and the quality of
   the fracture bone callus in ovariectomized rats.}},

Abstract = {{A single atomic layer of graphene, integrated onto an undoped bulk
   substrate in a back-gated transistor configuration, demonstrates
   surprising strong photoconduction, and yet, the physical origin of the
   photoresponse is not fully understood. Here, we use a detailed
   computational model to demonstrate that the photoconductivity arises
   from the electrostatic doping of graphene, induced by the surface
   accumulation of photogenerated carriers at the graphene/substrate
   interface. The accumulated charge density depends strongly on the rate
   of charge transfer between the substrate and the graphene; the
   suppression of the transfer rate below that of carrier's thermal
   velocity is an essential prerequisite for a substantial photoinduced
   doping in the graphene channel under this mechanism. The
   contact-to-graphene coupling (defined by the ratio of graphene-metal

Title = {{Bridging the great divide: Conspiracy theory research for the 21st

Abstract = {{This article starts from the observation that research on conspiracy
   theories is currently thriving, but that it is also fragmented. In
   particular there is an increasing divide between disciplines with
   culturalist and qualitative approaches, such as history, cultural
   studies and ethnology, and disciplines with quantitative and empirical
   approaches, such as psychology and political science. The article argues
   that this `great divide' has to be bridged for research to arrive at a
   genuine understanding of conspiracy theories. As a first step in such a
   bridge-building process, the article engages, from the vantage point of
   (American) cultural studies, with research done on the other side of the
   divide, namely in psychology and political science. It summarizes the
   work done in these fields and evaluates it critically, concentrating on
   methodology; the assumptions about the dysfunctionality of conspiracy
   beliefs; the circularity of some arguments; the focus on individual
   rather than social and collective aspects; the lack of engagement with
   the definition of the phenomenon; and the neglect of cultural and
   historical difference. The article ends with recommendations for future
   collaborative research projects.}},

Abstract = {{For a simple polygon P of size n, we define weak visibility counting
   problem (WVCP) as finding the number of visible segments of P from a

   that we can optimally answer WVCP in O(log n) time. Then, we reduce the
   preprocessing costs to O(n(4+epsilon)) time and space at the expense of
   more query time of O(log(5) n). We also obtain a trade-off between
   preprocessing and query time costs. Finally, we propose an approximation

Abstract = {{In this paper we present two type extensions for the modeling language
   MINIZINC that allow the representation of some problems in a more
   natural way. The first proposal, called MINIZINC, extends existing types
   with additional values. The user can specify both the extension of a
   predefined type with new values, and the behavior of the operations with
   relation to the new types. We illustrate the usage of MINIZINC{*} to
   model SQL-like problems with integer variables extended with NULL
   values. The second extension, MINIZINC(+), introduces union types in the
   language. This allows defining recursive types such as trees, which are
   very useful for modeling problems that involve complex structures. A new
   case statement is introduced to select the different components of union
   type terms. The paper shows how a model defined using these extensions
   can be transformed into a MINIZINC model which is equivalent to the
   original model. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Thermo-responsive Shape Memory Alloys are able to adopt a temporary

   this research is to develop shape memory woven textiles in which dynamic
   behavior achieves predefined geometric shapes. The requirement of
   geometric morphology was addressed through origami techniques. Combining
   foldability properties with shape change, it is possible to design
   textile structures with a variable number of layers. Difference in light
   transmittance is analyzed according to layer variation. Experiments
   conducted explore methodological processes aimed at future developments

Abstract = {{From 2014 to 2015, I curated an exhibition entitled LOUD silence, which
   was held in two different venues in California: Grand Central Arts
   Center at California State University Fullerton, followed by
   gallery@Calit2 at the University of California, San Diego. The
   exhibition offered the opportunity for viewers to consider definitions
   of sound, voice, and notions of silence at the intersection of both deaf
   and hearing experiences. The exhibition displayed prints, drawings,
   sculptures, videos, and several film installations, and featured work by
   four artists who have different relationships to deafness and hearing,
   including Shary Boyle, Christine Sun Kim, Darrin Martin and Alison
   O'Daniel. These four artists explored how the binary of loudness and
   silence might be transformed in politicized ways through their own
   specificities, similarities and differences in relationship to
   communication and language. The stereotypical view of the deaf
   experience is that they live a life of total silence, where they retain
   little to no concept of sound. But on the contrary, deaf studies
   scholars Carol Padden and Tom Humphries state that deaf people actually
   know a lot about sound, and sound informs and inhabits their world just
   as much as the next person (Padden and Humphries 1998: 91).Through these
   artworks, the artists aimed to loudly explode the myth of a silent deaf
   world, and they troubled just how ``inaudible{''} sound really is
   through their own visceral experiences of it. Ultimately, I argue that
   the work in LOUD silence offers an avenue for eradicating deaf
   oppression.}},

Title = {{Flow field topology of submerged jets with fractal generated turbulence}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Fractal grids (FGs) have been recently an object of numerous
   investigations due to the interesting capability of generating
   turbulence at multiple scales, thus paving the way to tune mixing and
   scalar transport. The flow field topology of a turbulent air jet
   equipped with a square FG is investigated by means of planar and
   volumetric particle image velocimetry. The comparison with the
   well-known features of a round jet without turbulence generators is also
   presented. The Reynolds number based on the nozzle exit section diameter
   for all the experiments is set to about 15 000. It is demonstrated that
   the presence of the grid enhances the entrainment rate and, as a
   consequence, the scalar transfer of the jet. Moreover, due to the effect
   of the jet external shear layer on the wake shed by the grid bars, the
   turbulence production region past the grid is significantly shortened
   with respect to the documented behavior of fractal grids in free-shear
   conditions. The organization of the large coherent structures in the FG
   case is also analyzed and discussed. Differently from the well-known
   generation of toroidal vortices due to the growth of azimuthal
   disturbances within the jet shear layer, the fractal grid introduces
   cross-wise disturbs which produce streamwise vortices; these structures,
   although characterized by a lower energy content, have a deeper
   streamwise penetration than the ring vortices, thus enhancing the
   entrainment process. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   interface charges, even under the coexistence of positive and negative
   charges, where threshold voltage shift (Delta V-th) cannot represent

Abstract = {{GemC1, together with Idas and Geminin, an important regulator of
   DNA-replication licensing and differentiation decisions, constitute a
   superfamily sharing a homologous central coiled-coil domain. To better
   understand this family of proteins, the crystal structure of a GemC1
   coiled-coil domain variant engineered for better solubility was
   determined to 2.2 angstrom resolution. GemC1 shows a less typical coiled
   coil compared with the Geminin homodimer and the Geminin-Idas
   heterodimer structures. It is also shown that both in vitro and in cells
   GemC1 interacts with Geminin through its coiled-coil domain, forming a
   heterodimer that is more stable that the GemC1 homodimer. Comparative
   analysis of the thermal stability of all of the possible superfamily
   complexes, using circular dichroism to follow the unfolding of the
   entire helix of the coiled coil, or intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of
   a unique conserved N-terminal tryptophan, shows that the unfolding of
   the coiled coil is likely to take place from the C-terminus towards the
   N-terminus. It is also shown that homodimers show a single-state
   unfolding, while heterodimers show a two-state unfolding, suggesting
   that the dimer first falls apart and the helices then unfold according
   to the stability of each protein. The findings argue that Geminin-family
   members form homodimers and heterodimers between them, and this ability
   is likely to be important for modulating their function in cycling and
   differentiating cells.}},

Abstract = {{This study was undertaken to evaluate demographics, clinical
   manifestations, laboratory findings and outcomes of children with
   inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Turkey.
   We analyzed the medical records of 127 children diagnosed with IBD
   (under 18 years old) between January 2004 and January 2012 in 8
   pediatric gastroenterology centers.
   Of the 127 patients, 90 (70.9\%) suffered from ulcerative colitis (UC),
   29 (22.8\%) from Crohn's disease (CD), and 8 (6.3\%) from IBD
   unclassified. The mean age of the 127 patients was 11.6 +/- 4.1 years,
   and 11.8\% of the patients were below 5 years old. Of the patients,
   49.6\% were male, and males were more predominant in patients with CD
   than in those with UC (72.4\% vs. 42.2\%, P=0.008; a male/female ratio
   of 2.62 in CD, P=0.0016). Approximately one fifth of the patients had
   extra-intestinal manifestations and 13.3\% of the patients had
   associated diseases. Extraintestinal manifestations and associated
   diseases were more common in early onset disease {[}P=0.017, odds ratio
   (OR)=4.02; P=0.03, OR=4.1]. Of the patients, 15\% had normal laboratory
   parameters including anemia, high platelet count, hypoalbuminemia,
   hypoferritinemia, and high sedimentation rate. Area under receiver
   operation characteristics was used to predict pancolitis in patients
   with UC. The values of C-reactive protein, sedimentation rate and
   pediatric ulcerative colitis activity were 0.61 (P=0.06), 0.66 (P=0.01)
   and 0.76 (P=0.0001), respectively. Four (4.4\%) patients with UC
   underwent colectomy, and finally two (1.5\%, 95\% confidence interval:
   0-3.7\%) patients died from primary disease or complications.
   IBD is an increasing clinical entity in Turkey. Features of IBD are
   similar to those in other populations, but prospective multicenter
   studies are needed to analyze the true incidence of IBD in Turkish
   children.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we present a microstructured capillary electrophoresis
   method for the determination of minimal amounts of nitrocellulose in
   dynamite samples. A 6-hole microstructured capillary (MSC) was selected
   for the method development. First, the hydrodynamic behaviour of the MSC
   was studied at varying lengths (31,41 and 51 cm), which had never been
   studied before. Next, one of the MSC segments (31 cm) was employed to
   develop a microstructured capillary electrophoresis method to determine
   nitrocellulose in dynamite. In a first evaluation, the dynamite
   derivatization process was investigated to obtain an efficient
   derivatization yield. Afterward, the instrumental parameters, more
   specifically voltage and capillary cartridge temperature, were
   optimized. Afterward, the analytical performance of the developed
   methodology was assessed. Dynamite analyses during a period of 15 days
   were performed to establish intra-day (10 analyses) and inter-day (40
   analyses) precision, obtaining RSDs lower than 6\% and 10\%,
   respectively. Besides, RSDs for migration time (<0.5\%), peak asymmetry
   (<3\%), resolution (<3.9\%), and S/N (<9\%) were obtained. Finally, a
   diluted sample of dynamite was analyzed, detecting amounts of
   nitrocellulose in the order of 220-400 pg. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Risk of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
   post-breast cancer treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy and granulocyte

   objective was to estimate MDS/AML risk associated with specific breast
   cancer treatments. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of women
   aged a parts per thousand yen66 years with stage I-III breast cancer
   between 2001 and 2009 using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
   Results-Medicare database. Women were classified as receiving treatment
   with radiation, chemotherapy, and/or G-CSF. We used multivariable Cox
   proportional hazards models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and
   95 \% confidence intervals (CI) for MDS/AML risk. Among 56,251 breast
   cancer cases, 1.2 \% developed MDS/AML during median follow-up of 3.2
   years. 47.1 \% of women received radiation and 14.3 \% received
   chemotherapy. Compared to breast cancer cases treated with surgery
   alone, those treated with chemotherapy (HR = 1.38, 95 \%-CI 0.98-1.93)
   and chemotherapy/radiation (HR = 1.77, 95 \%-CI 1.25-2.51) had increased
   risk of MDS/AML, but not radiation alone (HR = 1.08, 95 \% CI
   0.86-1.36). Among chemotherapy regimens and G-CSF, MDS/AML risk was
   differentially associated with anthracycline/cyclophosphamide-containing
   regimens (HR = 1.86, 95 \%-CI 1.33-2.61) and filgrastim (HR = 1.47, 95
   \%-CI 1.05-2.06), but not pegfilgrastim (HR = 1.10, 95 \%-CI 0.73-1.66).
   We observed increased MDS/AML risk among older breast cancer survivors
   treated with anthracycline/cyclophosphamide chemotherapy that was
   enhanced by G-CSF. Although small, this risk warrants consideration when
   determining adjuvant chemotherapy and neutropenia prophylaxis for breast
   cancer patients.}},

Abstract = {{After sharing, through its various steps of evolution, the form and
   status of a corporate body, the party organization is falling prey to
   the virus of personalization, which is invading so many realms of
   contemporary life. Italy provides the clearest example of this
   cross-national trend with Silvio Berlusconi's personal party. As a media
   tycoon and one of the wealthiest men in the world, Berlusconi could rely
   on a skilled professional apparatus as well as on huge financial means
   to set up, in a few months, a vote-generating machine and become a Prime
   Minister. His party model has been widely imitated, by both center-right
   and center-left organizations, with variations and deviations. This
   article presents an overview of the development of personal parties in
   Italy and an analytical framework based on Max Weber's types of personal
   power.}},

Abstract = {{The causes and consequences of plant flammability are a contested issue.
   In fire-prone ecosystems, high flammability is invoked as a trait (in
   combination with fire-survival traits) that enhances reproductive
   success and reduces competition in the post-fire environment. On the
   other hand, flammability may be a consequence of other selective forces,
   for example, deterring herbivores. Here, we use a standardised method
   for estimating the flammabilities of 99 species distributed across five
   biomes in a small area of the southwestern Cape Floristic Region, South
   Africa. The fire-prone Fynbos and Grassland biomes included many highly
   flammable species, notably among graminoids and small-leaved shrubs with
   densely packed, fine twigs. However, Fynbos included many weakly
   flammable species. In the fire-free biomes (Forest, Nama-Karoo and
   Thicket), most species had low flammability, especially succulents.
   However, flammable species also occurred in all three biomes, including
   species with traits normally attributed to non-flammable species (e.g.
   large leaves sparsely arranged on coarse twigs). Since these biomes are
   fire-free, flammability in these species cannot be attributed to a
   fire-related selective regime. (C) 2015 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Objectives: During normal left ventricular (LV) filling, a vortex ring
   structure is formed distal to the left atrioventricular valve (LAVV).
   Vortex structures contribute to efficient flow organization. We aimed to
   investigate whether LAVV abnormality in patients with a corrected
   atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD) has an impact on vortex ring
   formation.
   Methods: Whole-heart 4D flow MRI was performed in 32 patients (age: 26
   +/- 12 years), and 30 healthy subjects (age: 25 +/- 14 years). Vortex
   ring cores were detected at peak early (E-peak) and peak late filling
   (A-peak). When present, the 3-dimensional position and orientation of
   the vortex ring was defined, and the circularity index was calculated.
   Through-plane flow over the LAVV, and the vortex formation time (VFT),
   were quantified to analyze the relationship of vortex flow with the
   inflow jet.
   Results: Absence of a vortex ring during E-peak (healthy subjects 0\%,
   vs patients 19\%; P = .015), and A-peak (healthy subjects 10\% vs
   patients 44\%; P = .008) was more frequent in patients. In 4 patients,
   this was accompanied by a high VFT (5.1-7.8 vs 2.4 +/- 0.6 in healthy
   subjects), and in another 2 patients with abnormal valve anatomy. In
   patients compared with controls, the vortex cores had a more-anterior
   and apical position, closer to the ventricular wall, with a
   more-elliptical shape and oblique orientation. The shape of the vortex
   core closely resembled the valve shape, and its orientation was related
   to the LV inflow direction.
   Conclusions: This study quantitatively shows the influence of abnormal
   LAVV and LV inflow on 3D vortex ring formation during LV inflow in
   patients with corrected AVSD, compared with healthy subjects.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. We determined whether and how Minnesotans who were uninsured
   in 2013 gained health insurance coverage in 2014, 1 year after the
   Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded Medicaid coverage and enrollment.
   Methods. Insurance status and enrollment experiences came from the
   Minnesota Health Insurance Transitions Study (MH-HITS), a follow-up
   telephone survey of children and adults in Minnesota who had no health
   insurance in the fall of 2013.
   Results. ACA had a tempered success in Minnesota. Outreach and
   enrollment efforts were effective; one half of those previously
   uninsured gained coverage, although many reported difficulty signing up
   (nearly 62\%). Of the previously uninsured who gained coverage, 44\%
   obtained their coverage through MNsure, Minnesota's insurance
   marketplace. Most of those who remained uninsured heard of MNsure and
   went to the Web site. Many still struggled with the enrollment process
   or reported being deterred by the cost of coverage.
   Conclusions. Targeting outreach, simplifying the enrollment process,
   focusing on affordability, and continuing funding for in-person
   assistance will be important in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Surface texturing by fs-laser pulses has been performed in order to
   enhance optical absorptance of chemical vapour deposited diamond. The
   induced surface structures have been studied as a function of treatment
   dose D. Periodic structure with ripples of 170 nm has been observed for
   a D = 5.0 kJ cm(-2), although not well defined texturing and damaged
   structures have been obtained for both lower and higher doses. Raman
   investigations point out negligible changes in crystal bulk for all
   investigated samples, thus suggesting that physical properties of the
   crystal were not changed by the treatment. Optical absorptance is
   strongly enhanced by fs-laser texturing and it is an increasing function
   of the treatment dose. The absorptance of solar spectrum saturates up to
   values larger than 90\%. The obtained outstanding enhancement of photon
   absorption represents a preliminary and promising step for the
   exploitation of synthetic diamond in future high-efficient conversion
   devices for solar concentration based on photon-enhanced thermionic
   emission effect. (C) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim}},

Abstract = {{Lung disease is very common in patients with hematologic neoplasms and
   varies in function of the underlying disease and its treatment. Lung
   involvement is associated with high morbidity and mortality, so it
   requires early appropriate treatment. Chest computed tomography (CT) and
   the analysis of biologic specimens are the first line diagnostic tools
   in these patients, and sometimes invasive methods are necessary.
   Interpreting the images requires an analysis of the clinical context,
   which is often complex. Starting from the knowledge about the
   differential diagnosis of lung findings that radiologists acquire during
   training, this article aims to explain the key clinical and radiological
   aspects that make it possible to orient the diagnosis correctly and to
   understand the current role of CT in the treatment strategy for this

Abstract = {{Objectives: Economic impact of prostate cancer is increasing in relation
   to its increased incidence and increased patient survival. Clinical
   trials are essential to evaluate the efficacy and safety of new
   treatments but may also result in economic benefits by avoiding the cost
   of the drug. Our objective is to determine the avoided cost in
   investigational drugs in clinical trials of prostate cancer conducted in
   a period of 18 years in a tertiary center.
   Material and methods: We carried out an observational of prevalence
   study with retrospective collected data of clinical trials involving
   currently marketed drugs and cost avoidance during the study period
   (1996-2013) was calculated.
   Results: We include in this review five clinical trials on prostate
   cancer that met selection criteria of 18 performed. All of them were
   phase III, multicenter, international and with current marketed drugs.
   136 patients were included. Total cost avoidance of 696,002 and an
   average cost avoidance by clinical trial of 139,200 were obtained.
   Average cost avoidance per patient was 5,118(sic).
   Conclusion: Cost avoidance in investigational drugs is a tangible
   benefit of clinical trials, whose realization is a source of economic
   benefits for the hospital, not only by directly generated by each trial.
   Clinical trials are an exceptional framework for progress in clinical
   research and real savings for the health system (C) 2015 AEU. Published

Abstract = {{The adsorption of cobalt (Co) and cobalt-boron (CoxB) magnetic
   nanoparticles (NPs) at a liquid/liquid interface is examined. The Co NPs
   have a remanent magnetization while the CoxB is completely demagnetized
   in the absence of an external magnetic field. Cyclic voltammetry
   experiments reveal that the adsorption of these NPs at the interface
   shifts the positive potential limit toward lower values showing that a
   catalytic effect on the ion transfer process is occurring, while
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrates that their mode of
   self-assembly is directed by their magnetic properties. CoxB NPs form a
   homogeneous film while Co segregates in macroscopic patches, leaving
   some areas of the interface uncovered. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this article, we develop an understanding of native advertising, a
   growing new form of online advertising, which we define as desired
   marketing communications that appear in-stream. Current forms of native
   advertising can be considered in terms of their secrecy: how aware a
   consumer is of a native advertisement's source and intent. Based on
   existing research, we argue that less secretive native advertising will
   be more successful in the long run, and illustrate this using several
   cases. Finally, we detail important considerations for those marketers
   looking to capitalize on native advertising. (C) 2015 Kelley School of

Abstract = {{Unintentional injury is now the principle cause of child death in
   developed nations, and the prevention of it has become a key focus of
   health professionals. This paper presents a sociological/philosophical
   enquiry into child accident prevention discourse and its implications
   for practice. With a critical distillation of major child accident
   prevention literature spanning the last two decades, significant
   findings, recommendations and themes are identified. It is observed
   which preventative measures have been deemed successful, with the
   placement of strategies into the appropriate `E' category - education,
   engineering, enforcement, and environment. This process demonstrates the
   difficulties with and paradoxes inherent in the notion of accident
   prevention and buttresses a central hypothesis: that the child accident
   or injury in risk society is simultaneously predictable and random;
   knowable at a statistical level but enigmatic at an individual one. The
   accident, previously configured as unpredictable and inexplicable, has
   become wholly subject to risk society's raison d'etre, the laws of
   probability, and is thus rendered predictable and preventable on a
   magnified scale.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, two commercially available epoxidized cardanol resins, NC
   514 with approximately two epoxies per molecule and LITE 2513HP with
   approximately one epoxy per molecule were methacrylated and the
   methacrylated NC-514 resin (NC514VE) was used as the cross-linker unit
   and the mono-functional methacrylated LITE monomer (LITEVE) was used as
   the reactive diluent in both conventional DGEBA vinyl ester resin
   (DGEBAVE) and in NC514VE resin at changing concentrations. Resin
   formulations of NC514VE using styrene as the reactive diluent were also
   prepared. The methacrylated products were characterized via
   spectroscopic techniques like FT-IR and H-1 NMR spectroscopy. The
   viscosities of the liquid resin mixtures at 30 degrees C were examined
   and the curing behavior was analyzed via Differential Scanning
   Calorimetry (DSC). After the cure, the thermo-mechanical properties of
   the resins were determined via Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) and
   mechanical properties were determined via tensile tests. According to
   thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) data, at 30 wt\% co-monomer content,
   the temperature of 5\% degradation were in 270-300 degrees C temperature
   region meaning that the samples were stable until this temperature
   range. The effect of the diluent content and the structures of the
   different monomers on both liquid resin and cured resin properties were
   also evaluated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Most species of bees nest underground. Recent interest in

   In this study, a surface layer of decorative flat stream pebbles was
   experimentally deployed in 24 paired subplots amid a nesting aggregation
   of the bee Halictus rubicundus. Over 2 years, females consistently
   preferred to nest amid the pebbles rather than adjacent bare dirt.
   Species of Halictus and their relatives (Lasioglossum, Dialictus) are
   widespread native floral generalists found in many urban areas of the
   northern hemisphere. Discovery of this practical soil nesting
   enhancement for H. rubicundus offers an aesthetically acceptable

   results show that a denser billet can be obtained with the average
   temperature of 813 K of the droplets and a liquid fraction of 50\%. The
   porosity would increase whether the temperature further increased or
   decreased. Finally, the 7075 aluminum alloy was prepared by spray
   deposition technique with the optimum process parameters. It can be
   found that the distribution and types of the porosity were different at
   different locations. These results are in good agreement with the

Abstract = {{The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is the most widely used
   scale to evaluate the degree of neurological impairment in multiple
   sclerosis (MS). In this paper, we report on the evaluation of an EDSS
   modeling strategy based on recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) of
   posturographic data (i.e., center of pressure, COP). A total of 133
   volunteers with EDSS ranging from 0 to 4.5 participated in this study,
   with eyes closed. After selection of time delay (tau), embedding
   dimension (m) as well as threshold (radius, r) to identify recurrent
   points, several RQA measures were calculated for each COP's position and
   velocity data in the mono-and multi-dimensional RQAs. Estimation results
   lead to the selection of the recurrence rate (RR) of the COP's position
   as the most pertinent RQA measure. The performance of the models versus
   raw and noisy data was higher in the mono-dimensional analysis than in
   the multi-dimensional. This study suggests that the posturographic
   signal's mono-dimensional RQA is a more pertinent method to quantify
   disability in MS than the multi-dimensional RQA.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a compact
   optical fiber sensor based on a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI)
   cascaded with fiber Bragg grating (FBG) for simultaneous measurement of
   refractive index (RI) and temperature. In order to get a proper
   spectrum, we discuss the effects of different structure parameters of
   MZI. Using the resonant wavelength of the FBG (Dip(FBG)) and the
   interference dip of the MZI (Dip1), the RI and temperature of the
   surrounding medium can be determined. The sensor has good operation
   linearity. The experimental results show that the distinctive spectral
   sensitivities are 0.071 75 nm/degrees C and -91.766 67 nm/RIU
   (refraction index unit) for Dip1 and 0.009 09 nm/degrees C for Dip(FBG).}},

Title = {{Feasibility of one-eighth time gated myocardial perfusion SPECT

Abstract = {{Purpose IQ-SPECT, an add-on to general purpose cameras based on
   multifocal collimation, can reduce myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI)
   acquisition times to one-fourth that of standard procedures (to 12
   s/view). In a phantom study, a reduction of the acquisition time to
   one-eighth of the standard time (to 6 s/view) was demonstrated as
   feasible. It remains unclear whether such a reduction could be extended
   to clinical practice.
   MethodsFifty patients with suspected or diagnosed CAD underwent a 2-day
   stress-rest Tc-99m-sestamibi MPI protocol. Two consecutive SPECT
   acquisitions (6 and 12 s/view) were performed. Electrocardiogram-gated
   images were reconstructed with and without attenuation correction (AC).
   Polar maps were generated and visually scored by two blinded observers
   for image quality and perfusion in 17 segments. Global and regional
   summed stress score (SSS), summed rest score (SRS) and summed difference
   score (SDS) were determined. Left ventricular volumes and ejection
   fraction were calculated based on automated contour detection.
   Results Image quality was scored higher with the 12 s/view acquisition,
   both with and without AC. Summed scores were statistically comparable
   between the 6 s/view and the 12 s/view acquisition, both globally and in
   individual coronary territories (e.g. in images with AC, SSS were 6.6
   +/- 8.3 and 6.2 +/- 8.2 with 6 s and 12 s/view, respectively, p = 0.10;
   SRS were 3.9 +/- 5.6 and 3.5 +/- 5.3, respectively, p = 0.19; and SDS
   were 2.8 +/- 5.7 and 2.6 +/- 5.7, respectively, p = 0.59). Both
   acquisitions allowed MPI-based diagnosis of CAD in 25 of the 50 patients
   (with AC). Calculated end-diastolic volume (EDV) and end-systolic volume
   (ESV) were modestly higher with the 6 s/view acquisition than with the
   12 s/view acquisition (EDV +4.8 ml at rest and +3.7 ml after stress, p =
   0.003; ESV +4.1 ml at rest and +2.6 ml after stress, p = 0.01), whereas
   the ejection fraction did not differ (-1.2 \% at rest, p = 0.20, and
   -0.9 \% after stress, p = 0.27).
   Conclusion Image quality and LV functional parameters obtained with a
   one-eighth acquisition time were statistically comparable to the
   previously validated one-fourth time protocol using IQ-SPECT. Shorter
   acquisition times without loss of diagnostic accuracy provide improved
   patient comfort and streamlined departmental efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{The elastic stress and strain fields and effective elasticity of
   periodic composite materials are determined by imposing a periodic
   eigenstrain on a homogeneous solid, which is constrained to be
   equivalent to the heterogeneous composite material through the
   imposition of a consistency condition. To this end, the variables of the
   problem are represented by Fourier series and the consistency condition
   is written in the Fourier space providing the system of equations to
   solve. The proposed method can be considered versatile as it allows
   determining stress and strain fields in micro-scale and overall
   properties of composites with different kinds of inclusions and defects.
   In the present work, the method is applied to multi-phase composites
   containing long fibers with circular transverse section. Numerical
   solutions provided by the proposed method are compared with finite
   element results for both unit cell containing a single fiber and unit
   cell with multiple fibers of different sizes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Is religiosity a protective factor against suicidal behavior in bipolar
   I outpatients?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{186}},
Pages = {{156-161}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Several risk factors have been associated with suicidal
   behavior (SB) in bipolar disorder (BD), but little is known regarding
   possible protective factors. Religiosity has been related to favorable
   outcomes in mental health and to a reduction in the risk of SB, although
   the relation between BD, religiosity and SB remains under-investigated.
   The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between
   religiosity and SB in euthymic bipolar I outpatients.
   Method: In this study, 164 outpatients with BD type I with and without a
   history of suicide attempts were assessed and compared using a
   qutestionnaire to collect clinical and sociodemographic characteristics,
   the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, the Hamilton Depression
   Rating Scale, the Young Mania Rating Scale, the Duke Religious Index,
   and the Barratt Impulsivity Scale,
   Results: The suicide attempters (SA) group had more psychiatric
   comorbidity (p=0.007), more rapid cycling (p=0.004), higher levels of
   impulsivity in all domains (p=0.000), and less religious affiliation
   (p=0.006) compared with the non SA group. In the multivariate analysis,
   after controlling for covariates, non organizational religious
   activities (OR, 0.66; 95\% CI, 0.50-0.86) and intrinsic religiosity (OR,
   0.70; 95\% CI, 0.60-0.81) were associated with less SB.
   Limitations: A small sample size, the cross-sectional design that
   precluded the possibility of assessing cause and effect relationships,
   and the infeasibility of determining the time lapse between the last
   suicide attempt and the period when the patients were evaluated.
   Conclusion: Non organizational religious activities and intrinsic

   contextual concerns of the local community, with nuanced messages and
   appropriate messengers. In addition, respondents reported key principles
   informing their organizational strategies to deepen men and boys'

Abstract = {{Interpretation of seismic data in the margins of the Burgalesa Platform
   in the Basque-Cantabrian Pyrenees has allowed proposition of a new
   structural model that combines different modes of deformation during
   oblique tectonic inversion, conditioned by the distribution of Triassic
   salts. Deformation was decoupled by the presence of the salt horizon
   between basement-involved thrusts inverting formerly Triassic and Late
   Jurassic-Early Cretaceous extensional faults and a detached thrust
   system involving the Upper Triassic to Neogene sedimentary package.
   Structural units experiencing different styles of deformation are not
   only stacked vertically above and below the salt, but most importantly,
   they change from one to the other along-strike across the transversal
   edges of the Triassic salts. The Burgalesa Platform detached thrust
   system was confined between the basement-involved structures of the
   Cantabrian Mountains westward and the NW tip of the Iberian
   basement-involved structures (San Pedro) southward. This together with
   the obliquity between the Pyrenean shortening direction and the strike
   of the previous extensional faults, mostly during the late stages of
   deformation, determined the strike-slip reactivation of the
   basement-involved inverted faults and the lateral extrusion of the
   Burgalesa Platform detached Mesozoic successions above the salt towards
   the SE to form a prominent thrust salient oblique to the main Pyrenean
   trend. The proposed model combines thick-skinned with thin-skinned
   structural styles during oblique tectonic inversion and is consistent
   with the surface data, including the fracture system, the available
   subsurface data and the mechanical stratigraphy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a morphological and hydrogeological reconstruction
   of the Murcia Valley at the location of the great Roman stadium Circus
   Maximus in Rome. We reconstruct a valley segment using ERT (electrical
   resistivity tomography) and geoarchaeological drilling data that
   identified three main layers. The basal layer, with high resistivity
   values and convex shapes, is correlated to alluvial gravel and lithified
   silt-clay sediments. The middle layer shows low-to-medium resistivity
   values extending to concavities between the basal convex shapes. The
   very low resistivity values of this middle layer characterize elliptical
   to circular morphologies and have been ascribed to the presence of
   water-saturated clay-silt and peaty sediments. The surface layer is
   characterized by widespread lateral inhomogeneity interpreted as
   anthropogenic fill. The data indicate a pre-Roman anastomosed alluvial
   plain subsequently modified by human intervention. In an effort to
   reclaim the valley for construction of the Circus, the Romans utilized
   the natural topography and created a central embankment, later becoming
   the Spina, by filling depressions with sand taken from adjacent bars.
   Our study contributes to (1) knowledge of the pre-Roman landscape, (2)
   understanding anthropogenic modification of the Murcia Valley flood
   plain, and (3) archaeological interpretation of the monument. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The aim of the study was to ascertain if the cognitive bias (CB) test
   can be used to assess pigs' emotional state and classify them
   individually. Moreover, the test was repeated over time to assess its
   consistency. Thirty-six male pigs were individually trained during 14
   training sessions to discriminate between a bucket with (A) or without
   (NA) access to chopped apples depending on its position (left or right)
   in a test pen. Once pigs were able to discriminate between both
   positions, each animal was subjected to 2 A and 2 NA reminder sessions
   before performing the CB test session, where the bucket was placed on a
   central position with access to 2 pieces of apple. The trial was
   repeated after 5 weeks, reducing the number of training sessions to 4.
   Time to contact the bucket, time to eat (or try to eat in the case of NA
   sessions), number of vocalizations, number of times pigs were reluctant
   to move, number of escape attempts, and number of urination and
   defecation events were recorded. In the first trial, time to contact the
   bucket and time to eat was significantly lower in A than in NA from
   session 10 (P < 0.0012), indicating that pigs were able to discriminate
   between both positions. In the second trial, both variables were
   significantly lower in A compared to NA from session 2 (P < 0.005)
   onward, confirming the pigs' capacity to remember the task. Pigs were
   individually classified as having positive, negative, or neutral CB,
   according to the time to contact the bucket during the CB test session
   in comparison with the time taken during the remainder sessions. A large
   percentage of pigs were classified as positive CB in both trials
   (84.85\% and 94.29\%, respectively). However, there was no consistency
   between the results of both trials, suggesting that during the second CB
   test session animals were able to remember the content of the bucket of
   the first CB test session. Alternatively, other factors such as the time
   of the day that pigs were tested, the age of the animals, or their
   hunger state could have an effect on the results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Graphite is used in the HGTR/VHTR as moderator and it also functions as
   a barrier to fission product release. Therefore, an elucidation of
   transport of fission products in reactor-grade graphite is required. We
   have measured diffusion coefficients of Cs in graphite NBG-18 using the
   release method, wherein we infused spheres of NBG-18 with Cs and
   measured the release rates in the temperature range of 1090 -1395 K. We
   have obtained:
   D-Cs,D-NBG-18 = (1.0 x 10(-7) m(2)/s)exp(-1.23 x 10(5)J/mol/RT)
   These seem to be the first reported values of Cs diffusion coefficients

   Clinostomum sp. (P = 1.59\%, MI = 17.50 +/- 23.33, MA = 0.29 +/- 3.03)
   on the body surface and two unidentified metacercariae, referred to as
   Metacercaria 1 (P = 0.79\%; IM = 1, MA = 0.01 +/- 0.09) and Metacercaria
   2 (Digenea) (P = 0.79\%, MI = 7, MA = 0.06 +/- 0.62) in the swim
   bladder. Ergasilus sp. was the dominant species and thus classified as
   core, with Contracaecum sp. as the satellite and other species as
   secondary species. The spatial distribution of infection with Ergasilus
   sp. and Contracaecum sp. showed a typical pattern of aggregate
   distribution. The sex of the host did not influence parasitic
   infections, but infection with Ergasilus sp. showed a positive and
   significant correlation with biometric and epidemiologic parameters,
   whereas infection with Contracaecum sp. was correlated only with
   prevalence and abundance.}},

Abstract = {{Despite its widespread use in the determination of adsorption mechanisms
   and the estimation of surfactant diffusivity, the short-time
   approximation method, used for linearly fitting experimental dynamic
   surface tension data, should be validly applied only over a very
   specific range of time intervals or surface pressures. Therefore, the
   definition of general criteria for the applicability of this method and
   for error evaluation in diffusivity estimations is fundamental. In this
   work, a theoretical numerical simulation of the short-time approximation
   method was conducted, and general benchmarks for its accurate
   utilization were investigated. Specifically, for systems assuming planar
   gas liquid surfaces, diffusion-controlled kinetics and a Langmuir
   adsorption isotherm, simple rules were developed in terms of limiting
   surface pressure (pi(max)) and dimensionless time (t(max){*}) as a
   function of dimensionless surfactant concentration (C-o/a). For values
   greater than the limiting (maximal) conditions, the dynamic surface
   tension curve deviates from the short-time approximation straight line,
   and thus, the corresponding linear fitting could lead to significant
   errors in evaluating the diffusivity. The simple criteria proposed in
   this study thus precisely define the range of applicability for the
   short-time approximation method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{BRAIN STIMULATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1074-1084}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Preceding low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic
   stimulation (rTMS) with a bout of high-frequency rTMS called priming
   potentiates the after-effects of the former in healthy adults. The
   utility of primed rTMS in stroke remains under-explored despite its
   theoretical benefits in enhancing cortical excitability and motor
   function.
   Objective: To ascertain the efficacy of priming in chronic stroke by
   comparing changes in cortical excitability and paretic hand function
   following three types of primed low-frequency rTMS treatments.
   Methods: Eleven individuals with chronic stroke participated in this
   repeated-measures study receiving three treatments to the contralesional
   primary motor cortex in randomized order: 6 Hz primed 1 Hz rTMS, 1 Hz
   primed 1 Hz rTMS, and sham 6 Hz primed active 1 Hz rTMS. Within-and
   between-treatment differences from baseline in cortical excitability and
   paretic hand function from baseline were analyzed using mixed effects
   linear models.
   Results: 6 Hz primed 1 Hz rTMS produced significant within-treatment
   differences from baseline in ipsilesional cortical silent period (CSP)
   duration and short-interval intracortical inhibition. Compared to 1 Hz
   priming and sham 6 Hz priming of 1 Hz rTMS, active 6 Hz priming
   generated significantly greater decreases in ipsilesional CSP duration.
   These heightened effects were not observed for intracortical
   facilitation or interhemispheric inhibition excitability measures.
   Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of 6 Hz primed 1 Hz
   rTMS in probing homeostatic plasticity mechanisms in the stroke brain as
   best demonstrated by differences CSP duration and SICI from baseline.
   Though 6 Hz priming did not universally enhance cortical excitability
   across measures, our findings pose important implications in
   non-invasive brain stimulation application in stroke rehabilitation. (C)

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE
   To evaluate subjects with type 1 diabetes for hepatic glycogen depletion
   after repeated doses of glucagon, simulating delivery in a bihormonal
   closed-loop system.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
   Eleven adult subjects with type 1 diabetes participated. Subjects
   underwent estimation of hepatic glycogen using C-13 MRS. MRS was
   performed at the following four time points: fasting and after a meal at
   baseline, and fasting and after a meal after eight doses of
   subcutaneously administered glucagon at a dose of 2 mu g/kg, for a total
   mean dose of 1,126 jig over 16 h. The primary and secondary end points
   were, respectively, estimated hepatic glycogen by MRS and incremental
   area under the glucose curve for a 90-min interval after glucagon
   administration.
   RESULTS
   In the eight subjects with complete data sets, estimated glycogen stores
   were similar at baseline and after repeated glucagon doses. In the
   fasting state, glycogen averaged 21 +/- 3 g/L before glucagon
   administration and 25 +/- 4 g/L after glucagon administration (mean +/-
   SEM) (P = NS). In the fed state, glycogen averaged 40 +/- 2 g/L before
   glucagon administration and 34 +/- 4 g/L after glucagon administration
   (P = NS). With the use of an insulin action model, the rise in glucose
   after the last dose of glucagon was comparable to the rise after the
   first dose, as measured by the 90-min incremental area under the glucose
   curve.
   CONCLUSIONS
   In adult subjects with well-controlled type 1 diabetes (mean A1C 7.2\%),
   glycogen stores and the hyperglycemic response to glucagon
   administration are maintained even after receiving multiple doses of
   glucagon. This finding supports the safety of repeated glucagon delivery
   in the setting of a bihormonal closed-loop system.}},

Abstract = {{This review asks whether observers can obtain information about others'
   intentions from observation of their actions; and if so, whether this
   process is performed using direct perceptual or inferential processes
   (prominent examples of each being the intention understanding theory of
   mirror neuron function, and mentalizing accounts of intention
   understanding, respectively). I propose four conditions that should be
   fulfilled in order to support a direct perception account, and suggest
   that only two of these conditions are supported by the existing data. I
   then propose and review three further sources of evidence which have the
   potential to inform this debate, concluding that the data do not support
   the direct perception account. In particular, mirror neurons may be
   involved in lower-level processes of action perception, but there is no
   evidence to support their involvement in the type of higher-level
   intention understanding that is proposed by the direct perception
   account. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A strategy for fault detection and tolerance on the inverter that
   controls power flow in variable-speed permanent-magnet generators is
   proposed in this paper. The performance of the proposed strategy is
   analyzed in two different four-wire topologies. In the first topology,
   the neutral point of the generator is connected to the middle point of
   the dc-link capacitor bank, whereas in the second topology, it is
   connected to a fourth leg of the inverter. The main contribution of this
   paper resides in the control scheme, which allows a steady operation
   through a fault occurrence without the need of reconfiguring neither the
   inverter topology nor the control algorithm. In this way, transients and
   the use of extra hardware components are avoided. In addition, a control
   loop that allows limiting the generator losses at any operation point is
   presented in order to protect the machine. Finally, experimental
   results, obtained from a laboratory prototype, validate the practical
   feasibility of the proposed strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Derrida's public struggle with the spectre of Artaud began in the 1960s
   `La parole Soufflee' and `The Theatre of Cruelty and the Closure of

   le Moma (2002). The texts are read as attempts to break with the
   dominant critical/clinical readings of Artaud inaugurated by Jacques
   Riviere and as beginnings for a search to secure Artaud-immunity,
   protection for and against his words and works. It argues that Derrida's
   readings of Artaud systematically underestimate the power of his
   deliberate perversion of Platonism and his intimations of an affirmative
   metaphysics issuing from the replacement of the idea of the One by that
   of Chaos. The underestimation of the affirmative drive underwriting
   Artaud's work led Derrida to uncover a suicidal motif in Artaud-immunity
   that would eventually compromise his own understanding of auto-immunity.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: The optimal strategy for patients with isolated ostial bifurcation
   lesions has not yet been determined. We propose the modified flower
   petal technique for the treatment of Medina type 0,0,1 or 0,1,0 coronary
   bifurcation lesions.
   Methods and results: We selected 64 patients who had Medina type 0,0,1
   or 0,1,0 coronary bifurcation lesions. Percutaneous coronary
   intervention (PCI) was performed with the modified flower petal
   technique in all patients. After PCI, all patients were followed up to
   nine months after the intervention. Quantitative coronary angiography
   (QCA) analyses were performed for both the main and the side branch at
   baseline, after the stent implantation and at nine-month follow-up.
   Twenty patients (31.2\%) had ostial left anterior descending artery
   lesions, nine patients (14.1\%) had ostial circumflex artery lesions and
   the other patients had isolated ostial non-left main bifurcation
   lesions. The procedural success rate was 100\%. There was no death,
   myocardial infarction, subacute or late stent thrombosis at nine-month
   follow-up. In one patient, in-stent restenosis requiring reintervention
   was noted.
   Conclusions: The modified flower petal technique has excellent acute
   results and midterm clinical outcomes in the management of Medina type
   0,0,1 or 0,1,0 coronary bifurcation lesions.}},

Abstract = {{Although tissue and cell manipulation nowadays is a common task in
   biomedical analysis, there are still many different ways to accomplish
   it, most of which are still not sufficiently general, inexpensive,
   accurate, efficient or effective. Several problems arise both for in
   vivo or in vitro analysis, such as the maximum overall size of the
   device and the gripper jaws (like in minimally-invasive open biopsy) or
   very limited manipulating capability, degrees of freedom or dexterity
   (like in tissues or cell-handling operations). This paper presents a new
   approach to tissue and cell manipulation, which employs a conceptually
   new conjugate surfaces flexure hinge (CSFH) silicon MEMS-based
   technology micro-gripper that solves most of the above-mentioned
   problems. The article describes all of the phases of the development,
   including topology conception, structural design, simulation,
   construction, actuation testing and in vitro observation. The latter
   phase deals with the assessment of the function capability, which
   consists of taking a series of in vitro images by optical microscopy.
   They offer a direct morphological comparison between the gripper and a
   variety of tissues.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{30-40}},

Abstract = {{To grow out to contact target neurons an axon uses its distal tip, the
   growth cone, as a sensor of molecular cues that help the axon make
   appropriate guidance decisions at a series of choice points along the
   journey. In the developing visual system, the axons of the output cells
   of the retina, the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), cross the brain
   midline at the optic chiasm. Shortly after, they grow past the brain
   entry point of the optic nerve arising from the contralateral eye, and
   extend dorso-caudally through the diencephalon towards their optic
   tectum target Using the developing visual system of the experimentally
   amenable model Xenopus laevis, we find that RGC axons are normally
   prevented from entering the contralateral optic nerve. This mechanism
   requires the activity of a Rho associated kinase, Rock, known to
   function downstream of a number of receptors that recognize cues that
   guide axons. Pharmacological inhibition of Rock in an in vivo brain
   preparation causes mis-entry of many RGC axons into the contralateral
   optic nerve, and this defect is partially phenocopied by selective
   disruption of Rock signaling in RGC axons. These data implicate Rock
   downstream of a molecular mechanism that is critical for RGC axons to be
   able to ignore a domain, the optic nerve, which they previously found
   attractive. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Scope: We recently reported potent inhibition of VEGF signalling by two
   flavanols at sub-micromolar concentrations, mediated by direct binding
   of the flavanols to VEGF. The aim of this study was to quantify the
   inhibitory potency and binding affinity of a wide range of dietary
   polyphenols and determine the structural requirements for VEGF
   inhibition.
   Methods and results: The concentration of polyphenol required to cause
   50\% inhibition (IC50) of VEGF-dependent VEGFR-2 activation in HUVECS
   was determined after pretreating VEGF with polyphenols at various
   concentations. Binding affinities and binding sites on VEGF were
   predicted using in-silico modelling. Ellagic acid and 15 flavonoids had
   IC50 values <= 10 mu M while 28 other polyhenols were
   weak/non-inhibitors. Structural features associated with potent
   inhibition included 3-galloylation, C-ring C2=C3, total OH, B-ring
   catechol, C-ring 3-OH of flavonoids. Potency was not associated with
   polyphenol hydrophobicity. There was a strong correlation between
   potency of inhibition and binding affinities, and all polyphenols were
   predicted to bind to a region on VEGF involved in VEGFR-2 binding.
   Conclusion: Specific polyphenols bind directly to a discrete region of
   VEGF and inhibit VEGF signalling, and this potentially explains the
   associations between consumption of these polyphenols and CVD risk.}},

   shows random flaws of about 2 nm size, which results in limiting tensile

Abstract = {{Objective: Radiation-induced acute intestinal symptoms (RIAISs) are a
   common complication of radiotherapy for cervical cancer. The aim of this
   study was to use H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) combined with
   chemometric analysis to develop a metabolic profile of patients with
   RIAISs.
   Methods: Fecal samples were collected from 66 patients with cervical
   cancer before and after pelvic radiotherapy. After radiotherapy, RIAISs
   occurred in eleven patients. We selected another 11 patients from
   participants without RIAISs whose age, stage, histological type and
   treatment methods are matched with RIAIS patients as the control group.
   H-1 NMR spectroscopy combined with multivariate pattern recognition
   analysis was used to generate metabolic profile data, as well as to
   establish a RIAIS-specific metabolic phenotype.
   Results: Orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis was used
   to distinguish samples between the pre- and post-radiotherapy RIAIS
   patients and between RIAIS patients and controls. Fecal samples from
   RIAIS patients after pelvic radiotherapy were characterized by increased
   concentrations of alpha-ketobutyrate, valine, uracil, tyrosine,
   trimethylamine N-oxide, phenylalanine, lysine, isoleucine, glutamine,
   creatinine, creatine, bile acids, aminohippurate, and alanine,
   accompanied by reduced concentrations of a-glucose, n-butyrate,
   methylamine, and ethanol relative to samples from RIAIS patients before
   pelvic radiotherapy, while in RIAIS patients relative to controls,
   trimethylamine, n-butyrate, fumarate and acetate were down-regulated and
   valine, TMAO, taurine, phenylalanine, lactate, isoleucine and creatinine
   were up-regulated.
   Conclusions: We obtained the metabolic profile of RIAIS patients from
   fecal samples using NMR-based metabonomics. This profile has the
   potential to be developed into a novel clinical tool for RIAIS diagnosis
   or therapeutic monitoring, and could contribute to an improved
   understanding of the disease mechanism. However, because of the
   limitations of methods, technique, bacterial contamination of feces and
   small sample size, further research and verification are needed. (C)

Abstract = {{Objective: The objective of this study was to determine whether risk of
   early leukoplakia recurrence (within 3 months) following carbon dioxide
   (CO2) laser removal varies by clinical characteristics including lesion
   size, site and accessibility of margins.
   Materials and methods: A retrospective cohort study included patients
   with oral leukoplakia who had their first CO2 laser surgery for removal
   of oral leukoplakia between 2005 and 2010 at the UCSF oral medicine
   clinic. Twenty-six patients with 32 separate lesions met the eligibility
   criteria after a clinic database search was followed by review of
   clinical notes and biopsy reports from existing patient charts. Data
   analysis included computation of summary statistics, and logistic
   regression analyses to evaluate recurrence of leukoplakia by clinical
   characteristics of the lesions.
   Results: Patient data and the characteristics of lesions were evaluated
   as possible predictors of early recurrence following laser removal;
   these included age, sex, duration, size, appearance and histopathology
   of the lesion. The only one that reached statistical significance was
   poor accessibility of the margins of the lesion (vs. good accessibility,
   OR = 24.57 (95\% CI: 1.59-16.68), p = 0.016); the probability for trend
   for good, questionable, and poor accessibility was 0.0028. This finding
   remained significant after controlling for age, sex, duration and size
   of lesion. Four out of five lesions with poor accessibility showed
   recurrence at 3 months. Of these, three involved the gingiva and one the
   lateral tongue.
   Conclusions: This study has identified poor accessibility of the lesion
   margins as a predictor for early recurrence of leukoplakia following
   laser removal. Other variables evaluated did not reach statistical
   significance, possibly due to lack of power. (C) 2015 European

Title = {{A 10 nN resolution thrust-stand for micro-propulsion devices}},
Journal = {{REVIEW OF SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We report on the development of a nano-Newton thrust-stand that can
   measure up to 100 mu N thrust from different types of microthrusters
   with 10 nN resolution. The compact thrust-stand measures the impingement
   force of the particles emitted from a microthruster onto a suspended
   plate of size 45 mm x 45 mm and with a natural frequency over 50 Hz.
   Using a homodyne (lock-in) readout provides strong immunity to facility
   vibrations, which historically has been a major challenge for
   nano-Newton thrust-stands. A cold-gas thruster generating up to 50 mu N
   thrust in air was first used to validate the thrust-stand. Better than
   10 nN resolution and a minimum detectable thrust of 10 nN were achieved.
   Thrust from a miniature electrospray propulsion system generating up to
   3 mu N of thrust was measured with our thrust-stand in vacuum, and the
   thrust was compared with that computed from beam diagnostics, obtaining
   agreement within 50 nN to 150 nN. The 10 nN resolution obtained from
   this thrust-stand matches that from state-of-the-art nano-Newton
   thrust-stands, which measure thrust directly from the thruster by
   mounting it on a moving arm (but whose natural frequency is well below 1
   Hz). The thrust-stand is the first of its kind to demonstrate less than
   3 mu N resolution by measuring the impingement force, making it capable
   of measuring thrust from different types of microthrusters, with the
   potential of easy upscaling for thrust measurement at much higher
   levels, simply by replacing the force sensor with other force sensors.

Abstract = {{Background: Sirolimus has provided the option for calcineurin inhibitor
   (CNI)-free immunosuppressive therapy in both solid organ transplant
   (SOT) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However,
   long-term use of sirolimus has been reported to be associated with a
   high incidence of cutaneous side effects in SOT, particularly acneiform
   lesions. Materials and Methods: We studied the incidence of acneiform
   lesions and the risk factors in 41 HSCT recipients between ages 4 and 64
   years, undergoing HSCT for malignant (n = 29) and non-malignant diseases
   (n = 12) from haploidentical family donors. Results: Seven patients
   developed acneiform lesions at the median of 85 days (range, 45-105
   days). Acneiform lesions occurred in 6/11 patients on sirolimus and in
   only 1/30 patients not receiving sirolimus (P = 0.001). This was more
   frequent in patients with non-malignant disorders (5/12 versus 2/29, P =
   0.01) and those receiving graft from female donors (7/23 versus 0/18, P
   = 0.01). Conclusions: Despite being frequently reported in SOT, this is
   the first such report in HSCT. Our study suggests that prolonged use of
   sirolimus might be associated with high incidence of acneiform lesions
   in haploidentical HSCT recipients with non-malignant diseases,
   particularly in those receiving graft from a female donor. We discuss
   the possible reasons for these findings and the putative mechanism of
   acneiform lesions in these patients}},

Abstract = {{The influence of local tectonic processes that determined individual
   development of each particular graben in the Central Russian aulacogen
   is best reflected in the asynchronous appearance of compositionally
   different clastic materials in their sedimentary sections, which
   accumulated with variable intensity. Against the background of the
   stable composition of the clastogenic framework of the terrigenous
   Molokovo Group, there are intervals of the sedimentary section from tens
   to a few thousands of meters thick, where the heavy fraction of
   sandstones is highly enriched (35-95\%) with acute-angled epidote
   grains. Several features (relative instability of epidote in the
   hypergenesis zone, angular and fresh appearance of clasts, absence of
   correlation between the epidote influx and content of the main
   rock-forming components) imply the formation of epidote anomalies owing
   to local sources. Analysis of probable geodynamic mechanisms, which
   could determine development of the Central Russian aulacogen and its
   grabens, structure and composition of the upper part of the consolidated
   crust, made it possible to assume that the specific clastic material
   originates from epidote-rich blastomylonites occurring among metamorphic
   rocks of the basement in form of strata with anomalous petrogeophysical
   properties. Comparison between crystals and grains of epidote from
   blastomylonites and sediments shows that they are characterized by
   similar habit, sizes, and optical parameters and contain 25-30\% of the
   pistacite component, which is typical of secondary epidote that forms
   pseudomorphs after biotite and amphibole under conditions of partial
   melting. Regularities in the distribution of epidote-rich intervals in
   the sedimentary section are explained by relations between attitude
   elements of planes of Neoproterozoic normal faults and Paleoproterozoic
   blastomylonite strata, which served as local sources of clastic
   material. The same factor also determined the facies properties of
   sedimentary complexes and structural evolution of sedimentation basins.
   Crosscutting normal faults stimulated the formation of grabens with the
   rheologically determined subsidence limit (Molokovo type), particularly,
   in situations characterized by the gentle attitude of blastomylonite
   bodies. In such a situation, the subsidence of granitoid rocks into the
   denser amphibolite substrate was limited by isostatic leveling forces.
   Under the stationary regional strain field after reaching the subsidence
   limit, grabens of this type experienced lateral extension, which
   resulted in the accumulation of regressive sedimentary successions with
   the irreversible transition from the lacustrine to the fluvial-proluvial
   facies. Such grabens are characterized by the one-act manifestation of
   the local source of clastics regardless of the structure development
   stage. The development of more expedient (in terms of energy) normal
   faults along blastomylonite strata (Roslyatino type) did not disturb the
   isostatic equilibrium and resulted in the formation of narrow deep
   grabens, where depositional environments remained virtually unchanged.
   The epidote influx was in progress during the entire life of the
   accommodation space, since progressive deepening of the graben
   stimulated constant activity of its local source.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE. Hippocampal malrotation is characterized by incomplete
   hippocampal inversion with a rounded shape and blurred internal
   architecture. There is still debate about whether hippocampal
   malrotation has pathologic significance. We present findings from the
   Consequences of Prolonged Febrile Seizures in Childhood (FEBSTAT) study
   on the frequency of and risk factors for hippocampal malrotation.
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS. FEBSTAT is a prospective multicenter study
   investigating the consequences of febrile status epilepticus in
   childhood. MRI studies of 226 patients with febrile status epilepticus
   were analyzed visually by two board-certified neuroradiologists blinded
   to clinical details and were compared with MRI studies of 96 subjects
   with first simple febrile seizure. Quantitative analysis of hippocampal
   volume was performed by two independent observers.
   RESULTS. Hippocampal malrotation was present in 20 of 226 (8.8\%)
   patients with febrile status epilepticus compared with two of 96 (2.1\%)
   control subjects (odds ratio {[}OR], 4.56; 95\% CI, 1.05-19.92).
   Hippocampal malrotation was exclusively left-sided in 18 of 22 (81.8\%)
   patients and bilateral in the remaining four patients (18.2\%). There
   was no case of exclusively right-sided hippocampal malrotation.
   Hippocampal malrotation was more common in boys than in girls (OR, 6.1;
   95\% CI, 1.7-21.5). On quantitative volumetric MRI analysis, the left
   hippocampal volume was smaller in patients with hippocampal malrotation
   than in control subjects with simple febrile seizure (p = 0.004), and
   the right-to-left hippocampal volume ratio was higher in the hippocampal
   malrotation group than in the simple febrile seizure group (p < 0.001).
   CONCLUSION. Hippocampal malrotation is a developmental malformation that
   predominantly affects the left hippocampus in male patients and is more
   frequently found in children with prolonged febrile status epilepticus
   than in control subjects. These data provide further evidence that
   hippocampal malrotation represents a pathologic error in brain
   development rather than a normal variant.}},

Abstract = {{The leukocyte integrin cell adhesion molecules alpha 4 beta 7 and alpha
   E beta 7 mediate the homing and retention of lymphocytes to the gut, and
   sites of inflammation. Here we have identified heat shock protein 70
   (HSP70) as a major protein that associates with the cytoplasmic domain
   of the integrin beta 7 subunit. HSPs are molecular chaperones that
   protect cells from stress but more recently have been reported to also
   regulate cell adhesion and invasion via modulation of beta 1, beta 2,
   and beta 3 integrins and integrin-associated signalling molecules.
   Several HSP70 isoforms including HSP70-3, HSP70-1L, HSP70-8, and HSP70-9
   were specifically precipitated from T cells by a bead-conjugated beta 7
   subunit cytoplasmic domain peptide and subsequently identified by
   high-resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In
   confirmation, the beta 7 subunit was co-immunoprecipitated from a T cell
   lysate by an anti-HSP70 antibody. Further, recombinant human HSP70-1a
   was precipitated by beta 7 cytoplasmic domain-coupled beads. The HSP70
   inhibitor KNK437 decreased the expression of HSP70 without affecting the
   expression of the beta 7 integrin. It significantly inhibited alpha 4
   beta 7-mediated adhesion of T cells to mucosal addressin cell adhesion
   molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1), suggesting HSP70 is critical for maintaining beta
   7 integrin signalling function. The functional implications of the
   association of beta 7 integrins with the different isoforms of HSP70
   warrants further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate electron tunneling through atomically thin layers of

   counter-electrodes are employed. While the direct tunneling resistance
   increases nearly exponentially with barrier thickness as expected, the
   thicker junctions also exhibit clear signatures of Coulomb blockade,
   including strong suppression of the tunnel current around zero bias and
   step-like features in the current at larger biases. The voltage
   separation of these steps suggests that single-electron charging of
   nanometer-scale defects in the hBN barrier layer are responsible for
   these signatures. We find that annealing the metal-hBN-metal junctions
   removes these defects and the Coulomb blockade signatures in the
   tunneling current.}},

Abstract = {{Deposition of metal cathode in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices is
   known to cause serious metal atom penetration into the active layers and
   as a remedy, exciton blocking layer (EBL) is implemented. It is found
   that the metal penetration through EBL can be controlled by optimizing
   the idling time between the depositions of EBL and cathode layers. Both
   electrical and optical data show that the resistance of BPhen layer
   (EBL) to metal (Mg:Ag) penetration increase with increasing idling time.
   Also, significant variation in power conversion efficiency (PCE) is
   observed in subphthalocyanine chloride (SubPc)/fullerene (C-60) based
   organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells by simply adding idling time as an
   additional control parameter. Device with optimized BPhen thickness and
   idling time resulted in a PCE of 2.8\% whereas that of no idling time
   consideration has PCE limited at 2.3\%. These observations are
   attributed to slow processes of self-organization in BPhen after their

Abstract = {{A novel solid state bio-electrofermentation system (SBES), which can
   function on the self-driven bioelectrogenic activity was designed and
   fabricated in the laboratory. SBES was operated with food waste as
   substrate and evaluated for simultaneous production of electrofuels
   viz., bioelectricity, biohydrogen (H-2) and bioethanol. The system
   illustrated maximum open circuit voltage and power density of 443 mV and
   162.4 mW/m(2), respectively on 9th day of operation while higher H-2
   production rate (21.9 ml/h) was observed on 19th day of operation. SBES
   system also documented 4.85\% w/v bioethanol production on 20th day of
   operation. The analysis of end products confirmed that H-2 production
   could be generally attributed to a mixed acetate/butyrate-type of
   fermentation. Nevertheless, the presence of additional metabolites in
   SBES, including formate, lactate, propionate and ethanol, also suggested
   that other metabolic pathways were active during the process, lowering
   the conversion of substrate into H-2. SBES also documented 72\%
   substrate (COD) removal efficiency along with value added product
   generation. Continuous evolution of volatile fatty acids as intermediary
   metabolites resulted in pH drop and depicted its negative influence on
   SBES performance. Bio-electrocatalytic analysis was carried out to
   evaluate the redox catalytic capabilities of the biocatalyst.
   Experimental data illustrated that solid-state fermentation can be
   effectively integrated in SBES for the production of value added
   products with the possibility of simultaneous solid waste remediation.

Abstract = {{Small-data-set forecasting problems are a critical issue in various
   fields, with the early stage of a manufacturing system being a good
   example. Manufacturers require sufficient knowledge to minimize overall
   production costs, but this is difficult to achieve due to limited number
   of samples available at such times. This research was thus conducted to
   develop a modelling procedure to assist managers or decision makers in
   acquiring stable prediction results from small data sets. The proposed
   method is a two-stage procedure. First, we assessed some single models
   to determine whether the tendency of a real sequence can be reflected
   using grey incidence analysis, and we then evaluated their forecasting
   stability based on the relative ratio of error range. Second, a grey
   silhouette coefficient was developed to create an applicable hybrid
   forecasting model for small samples. Two real cases were analysed to
   confirm the effectiveness and practical value of the proposed method.
   The empirical results showed that the multimodel procedure can minimize
   forecasting errors and improve forecasting results with limited data.
   Consequently, the proposed procedure is considered a feasible tool for
   small-data-set forecasting problems.}},

Abstract = {{Low-level mercury (Hg) exposure in infancy might be harmful to the
   physical growth as well as neurodevelopment of children. The aim of this
   study was to investigate postnatal Hg exposure and its relationship with
   anthropometry and dietary factors in late infancy. We recruited 252
   healthy Korean infants between six and 24 months of age from an
   outpatient clinic during the 2009/2010 and 2013/2014 seasons. We
   measured the weight and height of the infants and collected dietary
   information using questionnaires. The Hg content of the hair and blood
   was assessed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. The
   geometric mean Hg concentration in the hair and blood was 0.22 (95\%
   confidence interval: 0.20-0.24) mu g/g and 0.94 (n = 109, 95\%
   confidence interval: 0.89-0.99) mu g/L, respectively. The hair Hg
   concentration showed a good correlation with the blood Hg concentration
   (median hair-to-blood Hg ratio: 202.7, r = 0.462, p < 0.001) and was >1
   mu g/g in five infants. The hair Hg concentration showed significant
   correlations with weight gain after birth (Z-score of the weight for
   ageZ-score of the birthweight; r = -0.156, p = 0.015), the duration
   (months) of breastfeeding as the dominant method of feeding (r = 0.274,
   p < 0.001), and the duration of fish intake more than once per week (r =
   0.138, p = 0.033). In an ordinal logistic regression analysis with
   categorical hair Hg content (quartiles), dietary factors, including
   breastfeeding as the dominant method of feeding in late infancy
   (cumulative odds ratio: 6.235, 95\% confidence interval: 3.086-12.597, p
   < 0.001) and the monthly duration of fish intake more than once per week
   (cumulative odds ratio: 1.203, 95\% confidence interval: 1.034-1.401; p
   = 0.017), were significantly associated with higher hair Hg content.
   Weight gain after birth was not, however, significantly associated with
   hair Hg content after adjustment for the duration of breastfeeding as
   the dominant method of feeding. Low-level Hg exposure through
   breastfeeding and fish intake as a complementary food did not directly
   affect anthropometry in this population. If prolonged breastfeeding is
   expected, however, the Hg exposure through fish intake may need to be
   monitored for both mothers and infants.}},

Abstract = {{Aberrant hedgehog signaling contributes to the development of various
   malignancies, including glioblastoma (GBM). However, the potential
   mechanism of hedgehog signaling in GBM migration and invasion has
   remained to be elucidated. The present study showed that enhanced
   hedgehog signaling by recombinant human sonic hedgehog N-terminal
   peptide (rhSHH) promoted the adhesion, invasion and migration of GBM
   cells, accompanied by increases in mRNA and protein levels of matrix
   metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9. However, inhibition of hedgehog
   signaling with cyclopamine suppressed the adhesion, invasion and
   migration of GBM cells, accompanied by decreases in mRNA and protein
   levels of MMP-2 and -9. Furthermore, it was found that MMP-2- and
   MMP-9-neutralizing antibodies or GAM6001 reversed the inductive effects
   of rhSHH on cell migration and invasion. In addition, enhanced hedgehog
   signaling by rhSHH increased AKT phosphorylation, whereas blockade of
   hedgehog signaling decreased AKT phosphorylations. Further experiments
   showed that LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K),
   decreased rhSHH-induced upregulation of MMP-2 and -9. Finally, the
   protein expression of glioblastoma-associated oncogene 1 was positively
   correlated with levels of phosphorylated AKT as well as protein
   expressions of MMP-2 and -9 in GBM tissue samples. In conclusion, the
   present study indicated that the hedgehog pathway regulates GBM-cell
   migration and invasion by increasing MMP-2 and MMP-9 production via the
   PI3K/AKT pathway.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate incidences of delayed disclosure of trading by corporate
   insiders (directors) in Australian firms and link this activity to
   personal wealth incentives and future firm performance. Delayed
   disclosure represents discrepancies in timing between trades reported as
   they occur and trades as disclosed in the firm's annual report. Over the
   period from 2007 to 2011, the rate of late reported trading was about
   6\%, being at its lowest in 2010 at 5.3\% and peaking at 6.8\% in 2007.
   The rate of delayed disclosed purchases was higher than the rate of
   sales. The likelihood of delayed disclosure was affected by insider
   wealth factors such as total compensation levels, equity compensation,
   and shareholdings and their positions within the firm. When executive
   and nonexecutive directors in small firms delayed the reporting of their
   purchases, these purchases signaled positive future returns. In large
   firms, only executive directors' sales were indicative of one year ahead
   negative returns. These findings suggest that delayed disclosed trades
   have information content about future firm performance and compensation
   structures influence the decisions by some insiders to engage in such
   activity for personal gain. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Ethnic differences in body composition and cardiometabolic
   risk have been reported in cross-sectional studies. This study aimed to
   investigate changes in body composition over 5.5 years, and its
   association with cardiometabolic risk in premenopausal black South
   African (SA) women. Methods: Changes in body composition and body fat
   distribution (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and computerized
   tomography), fasting glucose, insulin, and lipid concentrations, were
   measured in 63 black SA women at baseline (age: 278 years), and 5.5
   years later. Results: Body weight and fat mass (FM) increased by 6.9 +/-
   9.9kg and 4.3 +/- 6.9kg, respectively, over the 5.5 years with a
   relative (\%FM) increase in central and decrease in peripheral FM (all
   P<0.05). Fasting glucose and lipid concentrations (except
   HDL-cholesterol) increased over the follow-up period (all P<0.05). Both
   baseline and changes in body fat distribution were associated with
   cardiometabolic risk. Independent of baseline age, FM and insulin
   sensitivity, baseline trunk:leg was associated with reduced insulin
   sensitivity at follow-up (Matsuda index; =-0.41, P=0.002). Increasing
   trunk:gynoid ratio was associated with higher plasma insulin levels
   (=0.31, P=0.023) and reduced insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index; =-0.52,
   P<0.001) at follow-up. Conclusions: Weight gain in free-living black SA
   women over 5.5 years was associated with a centralization of fat mass,
   which predicted an increase in cardiometabolic risk.}},

Abstract = {{To gain the efficient and optimized application of agents MTH and ETH
   belonging to dithiazinanes to float gold from complex ores the
   investigation was undertaken on complexing conditions in water
   environment and at pyrite surface with manually attached gold (FeS2Au)
   prior to flotation tests. The microscopic and spectral analysis of
   (FeS2Au) surface after contact with MTH and ETH show the presence of
   organic S- and N-containing compounds. It is found that selective gold
   recovery from a gold-bearing material in flotation with MTH and ETH is
   conditioned by a number of factors that accelerate formation of poorly
   soluble compounds at the surface of gold particles. The analysis
   includes the contact time, optimal medium alkalinity, formation of an
   oxidized film at Au0 particle surface, introduction of modifying agents
   as additional ligands as well as mechano-chemical acceleration of the
   complexing. Mechano-chemical treatment with feeding a low soluble agent
   into a mill before flotation of copper-sulfide gold-bearing ore enabled
   to higher gold recovery into rough and intermediate flotation
   concentrates by 15.9 and 4\% respectively. In this case Au content in
   tailings was lowered by 0.15 g/t as compared to flotation experiments
   with butyl xanthate and its combinations with ETH.}},

Abstract = {{Methane gas storage in the form of Methane Hydrate (MH) in hollow silica
   was studied and compared with solid silica and pure water systems. The
   gas hydrate growth l dissociation was monitored by following the
   pressure (gas intake) - temperature variations in a classical isochoric
   process. The effect of stirring on the hydrate formation kinetics and
   yield was clearly evidenced in the case of solid and pure water systems,
   whereas it did not show any influence in hollow silica; and in fact, the
   yields remained identical in both stirring and non-stirring experiments.
   Approximately 3.6 m.mol of methane per gram of water was consumed as MH
   in the hollow silica matrix and the formation kinetics was extremely
   fast (similar to 180 min). However, the methane gas conversion into MH
   in solid silica and pure water systems was similar to 10 times higher in
   a stirred reactor when compared with a non-stirred system.}},

Abstract = {{Many microorganisms use quorum sensing to regulate several complex
   phenotypes, and this is accomplished by the release of a signal
   molecule(s) into the environment. N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) are
   a common class of signalling molecule utilized by a range of
   microorganisms (primarily Gram negative bacteria but most recently also
   archaea) and are often detected through the use of bacterial biosensors.
   Biosensors can be limited by both their specificity and sensitivity, and
   the aim of this study was to modify and improve current AHL detection
   strategies. The biosensor employed in the present study was Escherichia
   coli MT102 harbouring a plasmid containing a LuxR based biosensor, which
   produces green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporting mechanism. A new
   method of visualizing the GFP based biosensor overlaid on silica sheets
   for the purpose of thin-layer chromatography (TLC) is presented. This
   new method vastly improves sensitivity of AHL detection by a GFP
   biosensor than previously reported and as such represents a powerful new
   tool in AHL research. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A 3 year field campaign was completed to investigate spatial and
   temporal variability of sedimentation trends for a single pool-riffle
   pair located in the Santa Cruz Mountains, California. Our measurements
   represent a range of hydrologic conditions over 11 sediment-mobilizing
   events. Two different statistical methods were used to explore riffle
   sedimentation. Cochran's Q and McNemar's nonparametric tests (one
   method) indicate that riffle sediment surface texture was spatially and
   temporally varied at the transect level. For McNemar's test, variation
   was significant at p < 0: 05, with several trends evident, including
   strong riffle fining triggered by a 20 year flood event. A nonlinear
   empirical orthogonal function method known as self-organizing maps
   (SOMs; the second method) shows that riffle sediment surface texture is
   well described by two characteristic temporal signals, and one
   transitional signal at the sampling node level. SOM mapping to each
   sampling node clearly shows riffle sediment surface texture change was
   spatially organized over the 11 sediment-mobilizing events. Observations
   of pool sediment storage indicate that the pool-riffle pair exhibited a
   coupled sedimentation response (i.e., similar texture trends between
   pool and riffle) following the 20-year flood. The coupled response was
   characterized by a trend toward overall sedimentation conditions that
   were similar to those measured at the beginning of the study. The
   reported texture trends may be of interest to salmonid habitat studies
   that examine factors contributing to successful versus unsuccessful fry
   emergence.}},

Abstract = {{Imbalance in lipid metabolism within hepatocytes can lead to
   hepatosteatosis, which is a cause of numerous hepatic dysfunctions.
   Previous studies have demonstrated the roles of DJ-1 in Parkinson's
   disease, diet-induced oxidative stress, obesity, and diabetes. Although
   recent studies have shown that DJ-1 is involved in metabolic
   complications, the roles of DJ-1 in steatosis are largely unknown.
   Therefore, the aim of the current study was to elucidate the potential
   roles of DJ-1 in hepatosteatosis in vitro. Normal rat liver cells Clone
   9 (C9) were treated with 1 mM oleic acid (OA) for 24 h for establishment
   of a steatosis model, after which various biochemical parameters,
   including triglyceride, total cholesterol, and free fatty acid contents,
   were determined after knockdown with Dj1- specific siRNA. Silencing of
   Dj1 prevented hepatic steatosis by suppressing expression of hepatic
   lipogenic markers, which was confirmed by immunoblotting and real-time
   PCR analysis. Up-regulation of mitochondrial and beta-
   oxidation-associated proteins showed potential to reduce fat
   accumulation in the liver. Silencing of Dj1 resulted in alleviation of
   steatosis by reducing lipogenesis and improving mitochondrial
   biogenesis. Further in vivo studies will be required to understand the
   molecular mechanism behind the role of DJ-1 in steatosis.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: During pregnancy immunologic, metabolic, endocrine, and
   vascular changes occur, which make the pregnant woman susceptible to
   changes of the skin and appendages, both physiologic and pathologic.
   Aims: We undertook a clinical study to find out the frequency and
   pattern of dermatological disorders in pregnant women.
   Material and Methods: All consecutive pregnant women attending skin
   out-patient department with dermatological disorders over a period of
   3-year between August 2011 and November 2013 at our tertiary care
   hospital are included.
   Results: A total of 372 pregnant women were included in this study. Out
   of these, 146 (39.25\%) pregnant women were primigravida and 226
   (60.75\%) were multigravida. Skin disorders grouped into specific
   dermatoses (81 cases) and other dermatoses affected by pregnancy (291
   cases). In various specific dermatoses of pregnancy, atopic eruptions of
   pregnancy were the most common disorder (53 cases). The most common
   infectious dermatoses affected by pregnancy were vulvovaginal
   candidiasis (58 cases) and non-infectious dermatoses affected by
   pregnancy were acne vulgaris (14 cases).
   Conclusion: This study brings focus on pregnancy-specific and

Abstract = {{This article argues for the centrality of notions of personality and
   persons in the work of Walter Pater and asks how this fits in with his
   critical reception. Pater's writing is grounded in ideas of personality
   and persons, of personification, of personal gods and personalised
   history, of contending voices, and of the possibility of an interior
   conversation with the logos. Artworks move us as personalities do in
   life; the principle epistemological analogy is with the knowledge of
   persons - indeed, ideas are only grasped through the form they take in
   the individuals in whom they are manifested. The conscience is outwardly
   embodied in other persons, but also experienced as a conversation with a
   person inhabiting the most intimate and sovereign dimension of the self.
   Even when personality is conceived as the walls of a prison-house, it
   remains a powerful force, able to modify others. This article explores
   the ways in which these questions are ultimately connected to the
   paradoxes of Pater's own person and personality, and to the matter of
   his `style'.}},

Abstract = {{A simple digital photogrammetry technique using artificial targets is
   developed to conduct the synchronized ambient vibration measurements at
   different locations of a stay cable with multiple camcorders for the
   identification of mode shape ratios. To compensate the restrictions
   imposed by the adoption of budget equipment, elaborate adjustments in
   scale, synchronization, and baselines are performed. Based on the
   on-site measurements for three stay cables, it is verified that the
   proposed methodology can effectively measure the ambient vibration
   responses of stay cables and attain the same order of accuracy in the
   identification of mode shape ratios as that of high-resolution

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A systematic experimental study was performed to understand the role of
   surface contact angles in affecting the process of fast liquid transfer.
   Surfaces with different wettabilities were used, and the transfer ratio
   (alpha, the amount of liquid transferred to the acceptor surface over
   the total amount of liquid) was measured for each pair of surfaces. A
   numerical model based on the volume of fluid method was developed to
   help understand the experimental results. The surface wettability was
   shown to significantly affect the boundaries between three regimes based
   on stretching speeds: quasi-static (surface force dominated), transition
   (surface/viscous/inertia forces all important) and dynamic
   (viscous/inertia forces dominated). Specifically, the values of the
   boundary speeds were found to increase with vertical bar alpha(0) - 0.5
   vertical bar, where alpha(0) is the transfer ratio in the quasi-static
   regime, and alpha(0) is governed by the surface receding contact angles.
   Based on our results, an empirical equation to describe the transfer
   ratio as function of stretching speed was proposed. This equation can
   also be used as a prediction tool for the value of alpha for a fast
   transfer system. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Flaky alpha-Al2O3 with different sizes and morphologies was synthetized

   formation mechanism of flaky alumina and the influence of different
   titanium-containing additives (TiOSO4, TBOT, and TiO2) on the growth of
   alpha-Al2O3 crystal were discussed by SEM, XRD and EDS. Results showed
   that pure alpha-Al2O3 can be obtained by adding all the three kinds of
   titanium-containing additives, but the diameters, thickness, and the
   morphologies of flaky alpha-Al2O3 were greatly affected by the different
   titanium sources. The adding of TiOSO4 additive resulted in the largest
   diameter of alumina platelets, while adding TiO2 additive would greatly
   reduce the diameters. The growth velocities of crystal planes in
   diameter and thickness direction were influenced by the distribution
   differences of the titanium ions, which resulted in different
   morphologies of alumina platelets. Diverse reaction routes for different
   titanium sources in preparation process were also discussed in this
   paper. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All rights

Title = {{Clinical and radiography results of mini-plate fixation compared to
   suture suspensory fixation in cervical laminoplasty: A five-year
   follow-up study}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSURGERY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Lamina closure is the most common reason for failure of
   unilateral open-door laminoplasty. Mini-plate fixation was designed to
   solve such problem. We assessed the clinical outcomes and radiography
   results of mini-plate fixation by comparing it with suture suspension
   fixation.
   Patients and methods: This prospective study enrolled 57 patients with
   multi-segment cervical spondylotic myelopathy between January 2008 and
   March 2010. Thirty-four patients underwent laminoplasty with mini-plate
   fixation (mini-plate group) whereas 23 patients underwent laminoplasty
   with suture suspension fixation (suture group). The neurological
   function was measured with the Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA)
   score. Cervical range of motion (ROM), C2-7 angle, and the spinal canal
   expansive parameters (anteroposterior diameter, Pavlov's ratio,
   cross-sectional area, and open angles) were evaluated.
   Results: The mean follow-up time was 64(60-82) months. There were no
   significant differences in preoperative JOA scores (p = 0.191),
   postoperative JOA scores (p = 0.700), preoperative cervical ROM (p =
   0.315) and preoperative C2-7 angle (p = 0.074) between the two groups.
   Both groups had significant postoperative JOA improvement (p < 0.05).
   The mini-plate group had larger cervical ROM (p = 0.041) and C2-7 angle
   (p = 0.040) than the suture group at the final follow-up. Both groups
   showed significant improvement in the spinal canal expansive parameters
   immediately after the surgery. In the suture group, the parameters, such
   as anteroposterior diameter, Pavlov's ratio, cross-sectional area, and
   open angles, decreased along with time, mainly within the first 6 months
   following the operation. In the mini-plate group, these parameters
   remained unchanged. The spinal canal expansive parameters between the 2
   groups were not significantly different immediately following the
   operation, but were significantly different at the final follow-up (p <
   0.05). Three patients in the suture group displayed neurological
   deterioration due to lamina reclosure.
   Conclusions: Laminoplasty by mini-plate fixation preserved more cervical
   ROM and better cervical alignment, maintained cervical spine canal
   expansive stability and effectively avoided lamina reclosure for a
   long-term follow-up. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Pluripotent stem cells are capable of differentiation into different
   cell types, and therefore have great potential in clinical applications.
   The achievement of transcription-factor-induced pluripotent stem cells
   (iPS cell) avoids ethical issues and offers an invaluable source of
   patient-specific pluripotent stem cells for disease modeling, drug
   screening, toxicology tests, personalized medicine selection, cell
   therapy and regenerative medicine. As a milestone, iPS technology
   initiates a new era of pluripotent stem cells. However, even untill now
   many problems especially the key molecular mechanism of epigenetic
   reprogramming during this process, are little understood. Uncovering the
   molecular mechanism of this unique platform would shed light on
   improving the reprogramming efficiency and iPSC quality, ultimately
   advancing their therapeutic applications. In this paper we will briefly
   introduce the significant progress in this field and attach importance
   to combining high-throughput sequencing technique and systematic biology

Abstract = {{Copper antimony sulfide (CAS) is an attractive material with a suitable
   bandgap for sunlight absorption and a high absorption coefficient in
   solar cells. There are few works focused on the size-controllable
   synthesis of CAS nanocrystals, and no work reports on the special
   character of bandgap tunability until now. Herein, high-quality
   monodispersed tetrahedrite (Cu12Sb4S13) nanocrystals are synthesized
   through a novel solution-based method by using thiols as ligands. The
   as-prepared Cu12Sb4S13 nanocrystals have a narrow size distribution and
   wide size range from 2 to 16 nm, while their absorption band edges are
   continuously tunable from 620 to 780 nm. The quantum size effects with
   bandgap tunability of Cu12Sb4S13 nanocrystals are observed for the first
   time.}},

Abstract = {{Semi-polar (1-101) InGaN/GaN light-emitting diodes were prepared on
   standard electronic-grade Si (100) substrates. Micro-stripes of GaN and
   InGaN/GaN quantum wells on semi-polar facets were grown on intersecting
   \{111\} planes of microscale V-grooved Si in metal-organic vapor phase
   epitaxy, covering over 50\% of the wafer surface area. In-situ optical
   reflectivity and curvature measurements demonstrate that the effect of
   the thermal expansion coefficient mismatch was greatly reduced. A
   cross-sectional analysis reveals low threading dislocation density on
   the top of most surfaces. On such prepared (1-101) GaN, an InGaN/GaN LED
   was fabricated. Electroluminescence over 5 mA to 60 mA is found with a
   much lower blue-shift than that on the c-plane device. Such structures
   therefore could allow higher efficiency light emitters with a weak
   quantum confined Stark effect throughout the visible spectrum.}},

Abstract = {{Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a laboratory procedure to amplify and
   simultaneously quantify targeted DNA molecules, and then detect the
   product of the reaction at the end of all the amplification cycles. A
   more modern technique, real-time PCR, also known as quantitative PCR
   (qPCR), detects the product after each cycle of the progressing reaction
   by applying a specific fluorescence technique. The quantitative methods
   currently used to analyze qPCR data result in varying levels of
   estimation quality. This study compares the accuracy and precision of
   the estimation achieved by eight different models when applied to the
   same qPCR dataset. Also, the study evaluates a newly introduced data
   preprocessing approach, the taking-the-difference approach, and compares
   it to the currently used approach of subtracting the background
   fluorescence. The taking-the-difference method subtracts the
   fluorescence in the former cycle from that in the latter cycle to avoid
   estimating the background fluorescence. The results obtained from the
   eight models show that taking-the-difference is a better way to
   preprocess qPCR data compared to the original approach because of a
   reduction in the background estimation error. The results also show that
   weighted models are better than non-weighted models, and that the
   precision of the estimation achieved by the mixed models is slightly
   better than that achieved by the linear regression models.}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate the outcome of RIRS in managing symptomatic calyceal

   the records of 43 patients who underwent RIRS from 2005 to 2014 for
   symptomatic calyceal diverticular stones. A month after the initial
   operation, the success rate was (81.4 \%, 35 patients) of which 21
   (48.83 \%) patients were stone free and 14 (32.6 \%) patients had
   clinically insignificant residual fragments (CIRFs), and 90 \% patients
   were symptom free. Eight patients (16.6 \%) had significant residual
   fragments (> 3 mm), five of them became completely stone free after the
   second procedure, other three patients were symptom free and underwent a
   routine follow-up. The final treatment success rate was 93.0 \%. The
   initial success rate in the lower calyx was significantly lower than the
   other calices (P = 0.040). In addition, the association between the
   stone size and the initial treatment success was significant (P =
   0.036). There was no association between any of our other variables and
   the success rate. The mean first operative time was 60.95 +/- A 12.43
   min (range 34-92). No major complication (Clavien III-V) occurred,
   although there were five minor complications (11.6 \%) (Clavien I-II).
   There were no admissions to intensive care or deaths in our series, the
   mean hospitalization time was 1.77 +/- A 0.80 days. The management of
   calyceal diverticular calculus with RIRS is highly effective and can be
   accomplished with low morbidity.}},

Abstract = {{The signal-to-noise performance of heat-assisted magnetic recording
   (HAMR) is closely related to media magnetic and thermal property
   distribution, especially with the grain-to-grain variations in Curie
   temperature (T-c) or T-c distribution (sigma T-c). In this paper, we
   report an experimental study on T-c variations and related switching
   field distributions (SFDs) in FePt-based granular HAMR media by a new
   measurement method using two laser beams {[}one pump beam for heating
   and one probe beam for magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) signal
   detection] and a small perpendicular ac magnetic field (H-sw) applied to
   the laser heated media. The measured MOKE amplitude (or magnetization)
   changes with laser power (or media temperature) shows a peak at around
   T-c, while the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of the peak is related
   to the media T-c variations and SFD. The peak position is observed to
   shift to lower laser power (or media temperature) with broadened FWHM
   and SFD for larger H-sw. It is demonstrated that the proposed method,
   being consistent with previous measurement results, is fast and
   nondestructive. The experimental measurement method and results could
   provide us quantitative estimations and insights for T-c variations and
   SFD in HAMR media.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{84}},
Pages = {{38-45}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Constructed wetlands (CWs) have been used successfully to treat
   municipal wastewater. However, few studies have focused on the microbial
   community in CWs used for tertiary wastewater treatment. In this study,
   454 high-throughput pyrosequencing was applied to analyze the bacterial
   community in unplanted, planted, and litter loaded CWs. Results showed
   that both plants and litter increased the diversity and abundance of the
   microbial community in CWs. The effects of plant biomass on the
   bacterial community at the phylum level were not pronounced, but the
   compositions were significantly affected at the class and genus levels.
   Specific comparison down to the genus level revealed that the relative
   abundances of nitrifier, denitrifier and sulfate-reducing bacteria were
   positively correlated with the removal efficiencies of ammonia, nitrate
   and sulfate observed. Highly functional organization (>70\%) of the
   bacterial communities indicates that only a small group of species
   played a dominant role in CWs. The presence of plants and litter
   significantly affected the bacterial composition via alteration of
   carbon content (\%) and pH values in the gravel matrix. The observation
   in this study provides useful information about the effects of plant
   biomass on the bacterial community structure, which plays an important
   role in the tertiary wastewater treatment process in CWs. (C) 2015

   conductivities of baddeleyite type IVTMO2 (m-TiO2, m-ZrO2, and m-HfO2).
   The elastic constants and modulus, Poisson's ratio, hardness, sound
   speed, Debye temperature, and minimum thermal conductivities at high
   temperature were calculated. These calculations show that m-MO2 is not
   superhard, with a hardness range of about 8-13 GPa. Among these
   materials, m-TiO2 is the hardest, while m-HfO2 is the least hard. Their
   elastic and plastic anisotropy are given in detail. Moreover, the m-HfO2
   thin film is the most likely to develop microcracks during preparation
   because it has the highest elastic anisotropy. Among the three dioxides,
   m-HfO2 is the best thermal barrier because it has the lowest thermal
   conductivity.}},

Abstract = {{Heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) is ubiquitously found in a variety of
   organisms and plays an important role in cytoprotection, environmental
   monitoring, and disease resistance. In this study, the full-length
   complementary DNA (cDNA) of hsp70 from planarian Polycelis sp. was first
   cloned using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The expression
   levels of Pyhsp70 were analyzed in the presence of various stressors by
   real-time PCR, and its temporal-spatial expression patterns were also
   examined in both intact and regenerative animals by whole-mount in situ
   hybridization. The results show that (1) the deduced amino acid sequence
   of Pyhsp70 includes three typical HSP70 family signature motifs and is
   highly conserved during evolution; (2) Pyhsp70 expression is induced by
   prolonged starvation, tissue damage, and ionic liquid but inhibited by
   high or low temperatures; and (3) Pyhsp70 mRNA is mainly expressed in
   the head peripheral region and in the regenerating blastema during
   regeneration. These results suggest that the highly expressed Pyhsp70
   gene may contribute to enhance cytoprotection and tolerance against
   stress-induced molecular damage, and the migration of neoblasts to the
   wound, which might also be involved in the proliferation and
   differentiation of neoblasts. Our work provides basic data for the study
   of stress responses and regenerative mechanism in freshwater planarians.}},

Abstract = {{Partially blind signature is an important technique in secure electronic
   cash (e-cash) system. The first concrete certificateless partially blind
   signature (CLPBS) scheme for e-cash was constructed in 2011. Recently it
   was found that this construction had a security weakness and a rescued
   scheme was given. Unfortunately, the formal security proof was not
   given. In this study, the authors first give cryptanalysis of their
   rescued scheme. They demonstrate that a malicious user in their rescued
   scheme can forge a signature on any message by replacing the signer's
   public key. In an e-cash system, blind signatures issued by the bank are
   viewed as e-cash. Once they apply their scheme to an untraceable e-cash
   system, a malicious user can forge valid electronic coins (i.e. valid
   signatures) without being detected by the bank. It will result in loss
   of the bank. Then, they propose a newly improved CLPBS scheme which
   achieves the strongest security level and has higher computational
   efficiency than the rescued scheme published earlier. Finally, they give
   an example of potential application to e-cash systems using their
   scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainability is an urban development priority. Thus, energy and carbon
   dioxide emission reduction is becoming more significant in the
   sustainability of urban transportation systems. However, urban
   transportation systems are complex and involve social, economic, and
   environmental aspects. We present solutions for a sustainable urban
   transportation system by establishing a simplified system dynamics model
   with a timeframe of 30 years (from 1995 to 2025) to simulate the effects
   of urban transportation management policies and to explore their
   potential in reducing vehicular fuel consumption and mitigating CO2
   emissions. Kaohsiung City was selected as a case study because it is the
   second largest metropolis in Taiwan and is an important industrial
   center. Three policies are examined in the study including fuel tax,
   motorcycle parking management, and free bus service. Simulation results
   indicate that both the fuel tax and motorcycle parking management
   policies are suggested as potentially the most effective methods for
   restraining the growth of the number of private vehicles, the amount of
   fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions. We also conducted a synthetic
   policy consisting of all policies which outperforms the three individual
   policies. The conclusions of this study can assist urban transport
   planners in designing appropriate urban transport management strategies
   and can assist transport operation agencies in creating operational
   strategies to reduce their energy consumption and CO2 emissions. The
   proposed approach should be generalized in other cities to develop an
   appropriate model to understand the various effects of policies on
   energy and CO2 emissions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aiming to resolve the technical problems of lower gas concentrations and
   a reduced effective drainage period caused by gas-drainage borehole
   fracture development, a flexible gel (FG) gas-drainage borehole sealing
   material was developed that adapts to borehole deformation. In this
   study, based on orthogonal tests, the effect of the ratio of material to
   water, stirring time and stirring speed on the viscosity, filtration
   property, water retention and pumpability of the FG were studied. The
   results indicate that the stirring speed, ratio of material to water and
   stirring time in turn increased the viscosity and the ratio of material
   to water, stirring time and stirring speed enhanced the filtration
   property and water retention. The FG pumps smoothly and achieves the
   optimal state of high water retention, low fluid loss and low viscosity
   when the ratio of material to water is 1: 10, the stirring speed is 800
   r/min, and the stirring time is 12 min. The field test results indicate
   that, after using the FG, the average drainage gas concentration
   increases by 25.9\% and 27.6\% and the average negative pressure of
   extraction increases by 2.7 kPa and 3.5 kPa compared with expansive

   gender ideologies and the everyday mother-work of women, through which
   they agentically construct their maternal subjectivities. I draw upon
   data from the most popular Hungarian and Bulgarian childrearing Internet

   contrasting comparison of the `good mother' construct in the two
   postsocialist societies in question: a `choosing mother manager' in
   Bulgaria and a `mother-domestic-angel' in Hungary. The differences in my
   findings are attributed to the historically conditioned ways in which
   the hierarchical relationship between the value of `productive' and

   SUBLIMES IN CHINESE MUSICAL MODERNITY}},
Journal = {{MUSIC \& LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{96}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The sublime was at the aesthetic core of Chinese musical modernity from
   the first half of the twentieth century onwards. Not only was it an
   important subject for modern thinkers who introduced key ideas from
   Western philosophy, but the concept of the sublime was also translated
   into various Chinese terms. Notions of the Kantian beautiful and sublime
   were central to an ongoing discourse, but the Kantian sublime was never
   formally addressed with respect to music. What do survive are aesthetic
   remarks by critics eulogizing music in terms of its manly vigour and
   monumental grandeur, and it is these that prompt investigation into the
   philosophical context for the vigorous sound ideal promoted by
   reformers. The composer Huang Zi (1904-38) is a central figure since he
   not only referred to the final movement of Mozart's `Jupiter' Symphony
   in terms corresponding to the Kantian sublime, but also characterized
   the second movement using language drawn from classical Chinese poetics
   that invoked the immortals' wind-riding aspiration. His attribution of
   `hun' echoed Daoist transcendence as found in classical lyric criticism
   and provides a starting point for theorization of the Daoist sublime as
   a component of modern Chinese aesthetics that continue classical
   poetics. Huang's works embrace a sense of loss that places them apart
   from Chinese modernists' emphasis on strength and virility in accordance
   with Western theories of the sublime.}},

Journal = {{BRAIN STIMULATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1130-1137}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Translation of transcranial direct current stimulation
   (tDCS) from research to clinical practice is hindered by a lack of
   consensus on optimal stimulation parameters, significant
   inter-individual variability in response, and in sufficient
   intra-individual reliability data.
   Objectives: Inter-individual differences in response to anodal tDCS at a
   range of current intensities were explored. Intra-individual reliability
   in response to anodal tDCS across two identical sessions was also
   investigated.
   Methods: Twenty-nine subjects participated in a crossover study.
   Anodal-tDCS using four different current intensities (0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2
   mA), with an anode size of 16 cm(2), was tested. The 0.5 mA condition
   was repeated to assess intra-individual variability. TMS was used to
   elicit 40 motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) before 10 min of tDCS, and 20
   MEPs at four time-points over 30 min following tDCS.
   Results: ANOVA revealed no main effect of TIME for all conditions except
   the first 0.5 mA condition, and no differences in response between the
   four current intensities. Cluster analysis identified two clusters for
   the 0.2 and 2 mA conditions only. Frequency distributions based on
   individual subject responses (excitatory, inhibitory or no response) to
   each condition indicate possible differential responses between
   individuals to different current intensities. Test-retest reliability
   was negligible (ICC(2,1) = -0.50).
   Conclusions: Significant inter-individual variability in response to
   tDCS across a range of current intensities was found. 2 mA and 0.2 mA
   tDCS were most effective at inducing a distinct response. Significant
   intra-individual variability in response to tDCS was also found. This
   has implications for interpreting results of single-session tDCS
   experiments. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia show an excellent response to
   treatment with imatinib. However, in some patients, the disease is
   resistant to imatinib. This resistance may be related to the presence of
   genetic variations on the drug's pharmacokinetics and metabolism. We
   therefore studied three polymorphisms (C1236T, G2677T and C3435T) in the
   human multidrug-resistance gene (MDR1) in 86 patients with chronic
   myeloid leukaemia treated with imatinib. Imatinib resistance was more
   frequent in patients with TT genotype at locus 1236 than in those with
   CT/CC genotypes (p = 0.003). For the other two loci (G2677T and C3435T),
   resistance was seen to be higher for TT genotype when compared to GG/GT
   and CT/CC but it was not statistically significant (p = 0.13 and p =
   0.099). In conclusion, determination of C1236T MDR1 genotype may help to
   predict response to imatinib therapy in patients with chronic myeloid

Title = {{Rosiglitazone activation of PPAR gamma-dependent signaling is
   neuroprotective in mutant huntingtin expressing cells}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL CELL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{338}},

Pages = {{183-193}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) is a
   crucial transcription factor for neuroprotection in several brain
   diseases. Using a mouse model of Huntington's Disease (HD), we recently
   showed that PPAR gamma not only played a major function in preventing
   HD, but also oral intake of a PPAR gamma agonist (thiazolidinedione,
   TZD) significantly reduced the formation of mutant Huntingtin (mHtt)
   aggregates in the brain (e.g., cortex and striatum). The molecular
   mechanisms by which PPAR gamma exerts its HD neuroprotective effects
   remain unresolved. We investigated whether the PPAR gamma agonist
   (rosiglitazone) mediates neuroprotection in the mHtt expressing
   neuroblastoma cell line (N2A). Here we show that rosiglitazone
   upregulated the endogenous expression of PPAR gamma, its downstream
   target genes (including PGCla, NRF-1 and Tfam) and mitochondrial
   function in mHtt expressing N2A cells. Rosiglitazone treatment also
   significantly reduced mHtt aggregates that included ubiquitin (Ub) and
   heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), as assessed by a filter-retardation assay,
   and increased the levels of the functional ubiquitinproteasome system
   (UPS), HSF1 and heat shock protein 27/70 (HSP27/70) in N2A cells.
   Moreover, rosiglitazone treatment normalized endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
   stress sensors Bip, CHOP and ASK1, and significantly increased N2A cell
   survival. Taken together, these findings unveil new insights into the
   mechanisms by which activation of PPAR gamma signaling protects against
   the HD-mediated neuronal impairment. Further, our data also support the
   concept that PPAR gamma may be a novel therapeutic target for treating
   HD. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: The costs of military assets, including medical resources,
   are necessary for military planners when determining their force make
   up. The monetary cost of operating a Role 3 unit, the most comprehensive
   medical asset in the combat theater, has been determined. The cost of
   operating a Role 2 (R2) facility-the less comprehensive but more common
   asset-has not been assessed. Here we estimate the cost of operating an
   R2 medical asset in Afghanistan. Methods: Personnel costs were assessed
   by combining the U.S. Department of Defense estimate for personnel cost
   with the replacement costs for deployed staff. Manning was for a U.S.
   Marine Corps Shock Trauma Platoon and Forward Resuscitative Surgical
   System. Results: It costs \$2,956,873 a month to operate an R2 medical
   facility in Afghanistan. It also takes the place of a rifle platoon and
   disrupts the domestic military health care mission. Conclusion: The
   costs of operating an R2 medical facility are significant and should be
   considered when the medical benefits of an R2 are unclear.}},

Abstract = {{Background Intensive care unit-acquired weakness is a frequent
   complication of critical illness because of patients' immobility and
   prolonged use of mechanical ventilation.
   Objectives To describe daily measurements of peripheral muscle strength
   in patients receiving mechanical ventilation and explore relationships
   among factors that influence intensive care unit-acquired weakness.
   Methods Peripheral muscle strength of 120 critically ill patients
   receiving mechanical ventilation was measured daily by using a
   standardized handgrip dynamometry protocol. Three grip measurements for
   each hand were recorded in pounds-force; the mean of these 3 assessments
   was used in the analysis. Correlates of intensive care unit-acquired
   weakness (age, sex, illness severity, duration of mechanical
   ventilation, medications) were analyzed by using mixed models to explore
   the relationship to grip strength.
   Results Median baseline grip strength was variable yet diminished (7.7
   pounds-force), with either a pattern of diminishing grip strength or
   maintenance of the baseline low grip strength over time. With controls
   for days of measurement, female sex (beta = -10.4; P<.001), age (beta =
   -0.24; P=.004), and days receiving mechanical ventilation (beta = -0.34;
   P=.005) explained a significant amount of variance in grip strength over
   time.
   Conclusions Patients receiving prolonged mechanical ventilation had
   marked decrements in grip strength, measured by hand dynamometry, a
   marker for peripheral muscle strength. Hand dynamometry is a reliable
   method for measuring muscle strength in cooperative critically ill
   patients and can be used to develop interventions to prevent intensive
   care unit-acquired weakness.}},

Abstract = {{The permeability of the magnetic soft underlayer (SUL) was
   systematically varied by changing the antiferromagnetic exchange
   coupling, and the effect on recording performance and adjacent track
   erasure (ATE) and far track erasure (FTE) was investigated.
   Perpendicular magnetic recording performance highly depends on SUL
   permeability. Highly permeable SUL can reduce the head erasure field
   located at far tracks from a stressing track but generates more erasure
   at adjacent tracks near the side shield. Optimum SUL permeability can
   improve on-track performance with tolerable ATE or FTE. Finite element
   method models of a shielded write head and media with different SUL
   permeabilities were performed. A high-permeability SUL has a larger
   impact on short-time high FTE fields and potentially affects the erasure
   at 3-6 tracks from main pole. This shows agreement with experimental
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Lacteals are lymphatic vessels located at the center of each intestinal
   villus and provide essential transport routes for lipids and other
   lipophilic molecules. However, it is unclear how absorbed molecules are
   transported through the lacteal. Here, we used reporter mice that
   express GFP under the control of the lymphatic-specific promoter Prox1
   and a custom-built confocal microscope and performed intravital
   real-time visualization of the absorption and transport dynamics of
   fluorescence-tagged fatty acids (FAs) and various exogenous molecules in
   the intestinal villi in vivo. These analyses clearly revealed
   transepithelial absorption of these molecules via enterocytes, diffusive
   distribution over the lamina propria, and subsequent transport through
   lacteals. Moreover, we observed active contraction of lacteals, which
   seemed to be directly involved in dietary lipid drainage. Our analysis
   revealed that the smooth muscles that surround each lacteal are
   responsible for contractile dynamics and that lacteal contraction is
   ultimately controlled by the autonomic nervous system. These results
   indicate that the lacteal is a unique organ-specific lymphatic system
   and does not merely serve as a passive conduit but as an active pump
   that transports lipids. Collectively, using this efficient imaging
   method, we uncovered drainage of absorbed molecules in small intestinal
   villus lacteals and the involvement of lacteal contractibility.}},

Abstract = {{A fibrinolytic metalloprotease-like enzyme named TFase, was purified
   from the fruiting bodies of the medicinal fungus Tremella fuciformis.
   Purification of TFase was performed by a chromatography on DEAE
   Sepharose CL-6B and Superdex-75. TFase showed a molecular weight of 38
   kDa by SDS-PAGE and displayed a strong fibrin zymogram lysis band
   corresponding to a similar molecular mass. The enzyme demonstrated wide
   temperature optimum from 10 to 40A degrees C and pH optimum at pH 8.0.
   The fibrinolytic activity of TFase was strongly inhibited by EDTA and
   EGTA, which are metalloprotease inhibitors. The K (m) and V (max) values
   for enzyme using the artificial substrate pyroGlu-Gly-Arg-pNA were 3.81
   mM and 4.88 A mu moles mg(-1) min(-1), respectively. TFase of T.
   fuciformis partially dissolved a fibrin clot directly and specifically
   cleaved the A alpha and B beta chains of fibrinogen. In addition, the
   enzyme prolonged the coagulation time, and increased the activated
   partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time. These results suggest
   that TFase of T. fuciformis exhibits properties of a
   metalloprotease-like enzyme, shows novel fibrin(ogen)olytic enzyme
   activity, and has the potential to be a therapeutic agent for
   thrombosis.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Job embeddedness indicates the degree to which an employee
   of an organization intends to remain in his or her position at that
   organization. This study examined how job embeddedness affects infection
   control nurses' turnover intention along with general characteristics,
   job satisfaction, and perceived job alternatives.
   Methods: We collected data from a total of 133 infection control nurses
   using self-reporting questionnaire methods. All questions were answered
   on a 5-point Likert scale.
   Results: The average turnover intention was 3.01 +/- 0.72 (100-point
   conversion, 60.2\%), and average job satisfaction was 3.48 +/- 0.79
   (100-point conversion, 69.6\%). The average perceived availability of
   job alternatives was 3.02 +/- 0.78 (100-point conversion, 60.4\%), and
   average job embeddedness was 3.33 +/- 0.57 (100-point conversion,
   66.6\%). Predictors of turnover intention were monthly income, perceived
   availability of job alternatives, and job embeddedness. Job embeddedness
   among predictors has high explanatory power as a predictor of infection
   control nurses' turnover intention.
   Conclusion: Through this study we identified predictors of turnover
   intention and found that job embeddedness among predictors has high
   explanatory power as a predictor of infection control nurses' turnover
   intention. Strategies to enhance infection control nurses' job
   embeddedness are needed. Copyright (C) 2015 by the Association for

Abstract = {{The direct growth and integration of defect-modulated carbon nanotubes
   (CNTs) on n-type silicon (Si) microstructures for high performance
   photodetectors and chemiresistive sensors is presented. By devising a Si
   microspring that is strained by the growth force of the CNTs, a vertical
   load from the restoring force of the microspring is perpendicularly
   applied against the growth direction of the CNTs. This vertical load
   induces the formation of defective structures in the CNTs while the
   CNT-Si heterojunctions are fabricated. Under the illumination of UV
   light, photogenerated carriers from both the CNTs and the Si can be
   separated at the CNT-Si heterojunctions and at the defects in the CNTs
   before recombination, which contributes to a high photoresponsivity of
   262.3 mA W-1 and an external quantum efficiency of 91.4\%. Moreover, the
   adsorption of chemical species can be promoted by increasing the defects
   in the CNTs, thereby improving the sensing responsiveness toward ethanol
   and NO2 vapors. Our simple and facile growth of defect-adjusted CNTs on
   conductive Si microstructures would be beneficial to the scalable, high
   throughput manufacturing of heterojunctioned devices with tunable

   require several improvements in terms of their packaging process, color
   contrast, and reliability. This study investigates such enhancements via
   an open-structure design and a capacitive feedback system. It has a
   femto-farad level resolution and demonstrates a high operating speed
   (approximately 10 ms), effective ink dosing, and large color area change
   (approximately 92\%). The feedback system for the precise control of the
   color area is verified by testing under a wide range of interfacial
   tension. The system reduces the deviation of color contrast by 85\%.
   Working with high fidelity with large disturbances, which are
   represented by interfacial variations, the system shows robust
   performance against other disturbances, such as temperature variation
   and contact angle hysteresis.}},

Abstract = {{For multi-gigabit wireless transmission in fiber-wireless (FiWi)
   networks, one of the good promising candidates is terahertz (THz)
   communications. In order to analyze the performance of THz communication
   systems, where there exist multiple paths caused by THz signal's
   reflections, a proper channel model for describing the THz frequency
   characteristics and an adequate path selection algorithm is important.
   By bringing the blocking probability to describe the blocking effect of
   the propagation signals, this paper provides a modified THz channel
   model and proposes a path selection algorithm for finding the dominant
   signal. This paper also analyzes the correlation coefficient between
   propagation signals. Numerical results reveal that the modified channel
   model is suitable for describing the blocking effect of the propagation
   signals in the FiWi indoor environment and the proposed algorithm makes
   use of path diversity well to achieve the highest data transmission
   rate.}},

Abstract = {{Background Specific white-matter tract alterations in migraine remain to
   be elucidated. Using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), this study
   investigated whether the integrity of white-matter tracts that underlie
   regions of the pain matrix is altered in migraine and interrogated
   whether the number of years lived with migraine modifies fibertract
   structure.
   Methods Global probabilistic tractography was used to assess the
   anterior thalamic radiations, the corticospinal tracts and the inferior
   longitudinal fasciculi in 23 adults with migraine and 18 healthy
   controls.
   Results Migraine patients show greater mean diffusivity (MD) in the left
   and right anterior thalamic radiations, the left corticospinal tract,
   and the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus tract. Migraine patients
   also show greater radial diffusivity (RD) in the left anterior thalamic
   radiations, the left corticospinal tract as well as the left and right
   inferior longitudinal fasciculus tracts. No group fractional anisotropy
   (FA) differences were identified for any tracts. Migraineurs showed a
   positive correlation between years lived with migraine and MD in the
   right anterior thalamic radiations (r=0.517; p=0.012) and the left
   corticospinal tract (r=0.468; p=0.024).
   Conclusion Results indicate that white-matter integrity is altered in
   migraine and that longer migraine history is positively correlated with
   greater alterations in tract integrity.}},

Abstract = {{Investigation was conducted on the experimental fields of CCS University
   (Meerut) during 2013-2014 to evaluate the influence of Cr (III)
   contamination on soil mycobiota and to obtain some Cr (III)-resistant
   strains for the management of Cr (III)-contaminated soils and of the
   effluents carrying the metal. Blocks (30cm x 30cm) each were treated
   with different concentrations (500 ppm/1000 ppm/2000 ppm) of chromium
   (III) nitrate or chromium (III) sulphate solution separately in
   triplicates. Three blocks served as control. The soil samples collected
   aseptically from control and treated blocks after 20,40 and 60 days were
   analysed for mycobiota using serial dilution plate and soil plate
   methods. Overall dominance of anamorphic fungi and paucity of
   mucoraceous fungi was observed amongst the fifty two species of fungi
   isolated. Aspergillus niger was most tolerant to Cr (III) probably due
   to binding of Cr (III) by amide, amine and C=S groups on the fungus as
   revealed by FTIR spectroscopy. Reciprocal relationship between pollutant
   concentration `c' and time `t' (i.e. constancy of cxt) did not hold
   true; such a relationship might be operative for a single species
   in-vitro systems. Cr (III) salts adversely affected the mycobiota
   (qualitatively and quantitatively) though not to the extent reported for
   Cr (VI). The results indicate that though soil fungal diversity is
   adversely affected by Cr (III) contamination, the surviving species
   flourish over a period of time leading to the partial recovery of the
   mycopopulation. Aspergillus niger biomass with Cr (III)-binding
   functional groups might be utilized for in situ management of Cr (III)
   in soils and in biosorption-based effluent treatment systems.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Cholera is endemic in Bangladesh, with outbreaks reported annually.
   Currently, the majority of epidemic cholera reported globally is El Tor
   biotype Vibrio cholerae isolates of the serogroup O1. However, in
   Bangladesh, outbreaks attributed to V. cholerae serogroup O139 isolates,
   which fall within the same phylogenetic lineage as the O1 serogroup
   isolates, were seen between 1992 and 1993 and in 2002 to 2005. Since
   then, V. cholerae serogroup O139 has only been sporadically isolated in
   Bangladesh and is now rarely isolated elsewhere.
   Methods
   Here, we present case histories of four cholera patients infected with
   V. cholerae serogroup O139 in 2013 and 2014 in Bangladesh. We
   comprehensively typed these isolates using conventional approaches, as
   well as by whole genome sequencing. Phenotypic typing and PCR confirmed
   all four isolates belonging to the O139 serogroup.
   Findings
   Whole genome sequencing revealed that three of the isolates were
   phylogenetically closely related to previously sequenced El Tor biotype,
   pandemic 7, toxigenic V. cholerae O139 isolates originating from
   Bangladesh and elsewhere. The fourth isolate was a non-toxigenic V.
   cholerae that, by conventional approaches, typed as O139 serogroup but
   was genetically divergent from previously sequenced pandemic 7 V.
   cholerae lineages belonging to the O139 or O1 serogroups.
   Conclusion
   These results suggest that previously observed lineages of V. cholerae
   O139 persist in Bangladesh and can cause clinical disease and that a
   novel disease-causing non-toxigenic O139 isolate also occurs.}},

Abstract = {{Video broadcast/multicast over wireless access networks is an attractive
   research issue in the field of wireless communication. With the rapid
   improvement of various wireless network technologies, it is now possible
   to provide high quality video transmission over wireless networks. The
   high quality video streams need higher bandwidth. Hence, during the
   video transmission through wireless networks, it is very important to
   make the best utilization of the limited bandwidth. Therefore, when many
   broadcasting video sessions are active, the bandwidth per video session
   can be allocated based on popularity of the video sessions (programs).
   Instead of allocating equal bandwidth to each of them, our proposed
   scheme allocates bandwidth per broadcasting video session based on
   popularity of the video program. When the system bandwidth is not
   sufficient to allocate the demanded bandwidth for all the active video
   sessions, our proposed scheme efficiently allocates the total system
   bandwidth among all the scalable active video sessions in such a way
   that higher bandwidth is allocated to higher popularity one. Using the
   mathematical and simulation analyses, we show that the proposed scheme
   maximizes the average user satisfaction level and achieves the best
   utilization of bandwidth. The simulation results indicate that a large
   number of subscribers can receive a significantly improved quality of
   video. To improve the video quality for large number of subscribers, the
   only tradeoff is that a very few subscribers receive slightly degraded
   video quality.}},

Abstract = {{A novel strategy for the fabrication of an electrochemical label-free
   aptasensor for small-size molecules is proposed and demonstrated as an
   aptasensor for ochratoxin A (OTA). A long spacer chain of polyethylene
   glycol (PEG) was immobilized on a boron-doped diamond (BDD) microcell
   via electrochemical oxidation of its terminal amino groups. The
   amino-aptamer was then covalently linked to the carboxyl end of the
   immobilized PEG as a two-piece macromolecule, autoassembled at the BDD
   surface, forming a dense layer. Due to a change in conformation of the
   aptamer on the target analyte binding, a decrease of the electron
   transfer rate of the redox {[}Fe(CN)(6)](4-/3-) probe was observed. To
   quantify the amount of OTA, the decrease of the square wave voltammetry
   (SWV) peak maximum of this probe was monitored. The plot of the peak
   maximum against the logarithm of OTA concentration was linear along the
   range from 0.01 to 13.2 ng/L, with a detection limit of 0.01 ng/L. This
   concept was validated on spiked real samples of rice. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In an effort to improve a competitive blocking enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay (cELISA) for antibody detection to Equine arteritis
   virus (EAV), antigen purified by anion-exchange membrane chromatography
   capsule (AEC) was evaluated. Virus purification by the AEC method was
   rapid and easily scalable. A comparison was made between virus purified
   by the AEC method with that obtained by differential centrifugation
   based on the following: 1) the relative purity and quality of EAV
   glycoprotein 5 (GP5) containing the epitope defined by monoclonal
   antibody 17B7, and 2) the relative sensitivity of a commercial antibody
   cELISA with the only change being the 2 purified antigens. On evaluation
   by Western blot using GP5-specific monoclonal antibody 17B7, the
   AEC-purified EAV contained 86\% GP5 monomer whereas the differentially
   centrifuged EAV contained <29\% of the monomer. Improvement of
   analytical sensitivity without sacrifice of analytical specificity was
   clearly evident when cELISAs prepared with EAV antigen by each
   purification method were evaluated using 7 sensitivity and specificity
   check sets. Furthermore, the AEC-purified EAV-based cELISA had 30-40\%
   higher agreement with the virus neutralization (VN) test than the cELISA
   prepared with differentially centrifuged EAV based on testing 40
   borderline EAV-seropositive samples as defined by the VN test. In
   addition, the AEC-purified cELISA had highly significant (P = 0.001)
   robustness indicated by intra-laboratory repeatability and
   interlaboratory reproducibility when evaluated with the sensitivity
   check sets. Thus, use of AEC-purified EAV in the cELISA should lead to
   closer harmonization of the cELISA with the World Organization for
   Animal Health-prescribed VN test.}},

Abstract = {{A number of compounds isolated from mushrooms have exhibited
   disease-modifying effects. We sought to investigate the mechanisms
   responsible for the anti-inflammatory effects of an extract from the
   mushroom species Sarcodon asparatus (SAE). Male BALB/c mice (N=42; 6
   weeks old) were randomly assigned to four treatment groups.
   Intraperitoneal administration of SAE significantly attenuated
   lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated increases in alanine aminotransferase
   (ALT) activity. LPS also increased serum levels of proinflammatory
   cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-, which were dose-dependently
   and significantly attenuated by SAE. Correlative relationships between
   serum ALT activity and proinflammatory cytokines suggested that
   SAE-mediated suppression of liver injury was partly attributable to the
   attenuation of serum inflammatory responses. SAE significantly decreased
   hepatic NO center dot production and subsequent 3-nitrotyrosine
   formation, and the hepatic NO center dot production significantly
   correlated with serum ALT and cytokine levels, suggesting that SAE
   mitigates liver injury in association with inflammatory processes,
   likely by suppressing NO center dot production. Anti-inflammatory
   activity and further mechanisms of SAE were evaluated using RAW264.7
   with LPS challenge. Noncytotoxic levels of SAE significantly attenuated
   NO center dot production in RAW264.7 cells and also markedly suppressed
   the expression of iNOS and other proinflammatory mediators, including
   COX-2 and IL-6, which were upregulated in the presence of LPS. SAE
   inhibited the phosphorylation of p65, an observation that occurred
   independently of IKK-mediated IB phosphorylation. Collectively, our
   results demonstrate that SAE suppressed NO center dot-mediated
   inflammation by inhibiting p65 transcriptional activation without
   affecting IKK-mediated IB phosphorylation. Further studies are warranted
   to examine the major compounds responsible for these effects and the
   mechanisms responsible for the p65 phosphorylation observed.}},

Abstract = {{Electromagnetic Investigation of the Sub-Surface (EISS) is a Ground
   Penetrating Radar (GPR) operating at very low frequencies in the HF
   range (2-4 MHz) that was designed to investigate the composition and
   structure of the Martian subsurface to depths of similar to 1 km. EISS
   can operate in both a monostatic and bistatic configuration, the latter
   being made possible by the simultaneous operation of two separate
   instrument platforms. The first, a fixed lander, utilizes one
   surface-deployed dipole antenna made of two 35 m-long resistively-loaded
   monopoles to transmit radar pulses into the subsurface. Echoes from
   subsurface reflectors are then received by either similar electrical
   receiving antennas (on the lander) or by a much smaller magnetic sensor
   that can be mounted either on the lander or on a mobile platform, such
   as a rover.
   In this paper, we report on the successful test of EISS bistatic mode of
   operation during a field campaign in the West Egyptian desert. From the
   analysis of the measured propagation delays, the dielectric constant and
   the depth of several reflecting subsurface interfaces were retrieved. Up
   to 2(26) coherent additions (or stacking) were performed resulting in
   the detection of buried interfaces and in particular of the Nubian
   Aquifer at a depth >200 m. The results obtained with the small magnetic
   sensor were consistent with those obtained with the electrical antennas,
   suggesting that such an experiment can meet the constraints of a space
   mission. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:To compare maternal and neonatal morbidities among obese women
   and their offspring by attempted delivery approach.METHODS:We performed
   a retrospective cohort study of 47,372 obese women at delivery (body
   mass index 30 or greater) eligible for vaginal delivery who were
   carrying singleton vertex fetuses at 37 weeks of gestation or greater.
   Prior cesarean delivery, congenital anomalies, and antepartum stillbirth
   were exclusion criteria. We analyzed outcomes by attempted delivery
   route and stratified by parity. The composite maternal outcome included
   intensive care admission, death, hemorrhage, transfusion, or
   thromboembolism. The neonatal composite included intensive care unit
   admission, death, seizure, ventilator use, birth injury, or asphyxia.
   Adjusted relative risks (RRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were
   calculated using Poisson regression.RESULTS:Among nulliparous women
   attempting vaginal delivery (n=15,268), the success rate was 72.6\% and
   among parous women (n=23,426), it was 93.7\%. The maternal composite
   outcome rate was not statistically higher among nulliparous women (7.7\%
   compared with 4.2\% {[}adjusted RR 1.58, 95\% CI 0.96-2.59]) but it was
   among parous women (7.6\% compared with 2.5\% {[}adjusted RR 2.45, 95\%
   CI 1.23-4.90]) attempting vaginal delivery related to hemorrhage, blood
   transfusion, or both. In contrast, the neonatal composite outcome rate
   was lower in parous women (6.0\% compared with 11.6\% {[}adjusted RR
   0.65, 95\% CI 0.51-0.83]) but not in nulliparous women (10.2\% compared
   with 12.4\% {[}adjusted RR 0.91, 95\% CI 0.74-1.12])
   parous.CONCLUSION:In obese nulliparous women, attempted vaginal delivery
   was not associated with increased composite maternal or neonatal
   morbidity. In obese parous women, attempted vaginal delivery was
   associated with increased composite maternal morbidity and lower
   composite neonatal morbidity.LEVEL OF EVIDENCE:II}},

Abstract = {{The public investment in sports venues is a defining characteristic of
   post Second World War, American urbanism. Those who have committed
   capital to these constructions endeavor to ensure that these locales are
   profitable. These investments often with state and civic subsidy, are
   now a strident component of inter-urban competition for consumption
   dollars. Indeed, the competition between cities for sports franchises
   and other capitalist enterprises exacerbates the tenuousness of
   ``place{''} in ``placeless{''} times.
   For Lewis Mumford, the significant stage on which we enact and re-enact
   our cultural dramas is ``the city.{''} The affiliation, between a sports
   franchise that represents a city in its team name and the city itself,
   has been opportunistic for both entities. However, over recent decades,
   this relationship has engendered extensive debate regarding whether the
   economic opportunities for each are equitable and justifiable.
   This paper considers how professional sport edifices have been deployed
   as icons of urban regeneration in the United States in the second half
   of the twentieth century and will highlight how that ``regenerative
   potential{''} has come to be underwritten by the televised sports
   broadcast. Proceeding from this encapsulation, it will examine the role
   of sports, and its televised representation in the competition between
   US cities for economic and cultural investment. Specific emphasis will
   be placed on a commonplace, but often overlooked, televisual trope: the
   aerial view from the blimp. Seen as complicit with the investments and
   social constructions of sports franchises and the larger economic canvas
   on which they operate, this paper will then consider the instrumentality
   of the blimp in promulgating the economic imperatives that underlie
   contemporary sport. Finally, it asserts that this obliges us to reflect
   on the notion of seeing and vision as susceptible to manipulations
   which, in this particular case, are central to the deliberate rendering
   of urban ``place{''} as artificial ``landscape{''}.}},

Abstract = {{AimsTo test the hypothesis that voiding in anesthetized rats is preceded
   by recurrent changes in the pattern of bladder pressure. To explore the
   use of frequency analysis as an analytical tool for automatically
   detecting these changes and to provide quantitative data on bladder
   pre-voiding activity.
   MethodsWe developed an algorithm, based on frequency analysis, to study
   bladder pressure during the filling phase in anesthetized rats. Two
   applications of the algorithm were tested: (i) as a predictor of a
   voiding contraction with alarms generated which would make conditional
   nerve stimulation to prevent incontinence possible; and (ii) as a new
   index to quantify rapid pressure transients in normal and overactive
   detrusor conditions (i.e., induced by acetic acid instillation into the
   bladder).
   ResultsThe results show that a very high percentage (approximate to
   90\%) of the alarms was generated by the algorithm within 100sec before
   voiding. The index of rapid transients and the bladder volume before
   voiding were respectively approximate to 13\% less and approximate to
   42\% less in acetic acid.
   ConclusionsWe have shown that a simple algorithm, based on frequency
   analysis of bladder pressure, can be used to predict voiding and to
   provide quantitative data on non-voiding bladder activity and its
   changes due to pathology. Although the results refer to anesthetized
   rats, they are promising and warrant further urodynamic investigation to
   identify if similar patterns occur in non-anesthetized rats and in
   humans. Neurourol. Urodynam. 34:794-799, 2015. (c) 2014 Wiley

Abstract = {{Given the increasing identification of children with
   emotional/behavioral disorders (EBD), it is imperative that innovative
   ways of addressing these concerns are explored. Fewer than half of
   students identified with mental illness receive treatment, leaving a
   significant proportion of students to cope with mental illness without
   support. One option for increasing children's access to mental health
   service looks at incorporating treatment programs into educational
   systems, thereby allowing more children to access a greater variety of
   service. However, it is necessary to ensure that school-based personnel
   have the required training and understanding of mental health issues so
   that children may be appropriately supported. As such, providing
   university-level training programs for teachers and school staff to
   better understand and identify mental health issues may be a key factor

Abstract = {{BACKGROUNDAlthough recent evidence suggests worse outcomes for patients
   admitted to the hospital on a weekend, the impact of weekend discharge
   is less understood.
   METHODSUtilizing the 2012 California Office of Statewide Health Planning
   and Development database, the impact of weekend discharge on 30-day
   hospital readmission rates for patients admitted with acute myocardial
   infarction (AMI), congestive heart failure (CHF), or pneumonia (PNA) was
   investigated.
   RESULTSOut of 266,519 patients, 60,097 (22.5\%) were discharged on a
   weekend. Unadjusted 30-day hospital readmission rates were similar
   between weekend and weekday discharges (AMI: 21.9\% vs 21.9\%; CHF:
   15.4\% vs 16.0\%; PNA: 12.1\% vs 12.4\%). Patients discharged on a
   weekday had a longer length of stay and were more often discharged to a
   skilled nursing facility. However, in multivariable logistic regression
   models, weekend discharge was not associated with readmission (AMI: odds
   ratio {[}OR] 1.02 {[}95\% CI: 0.98-1.06]; CHF: OR 0.99 {[}95\% CI:
   0.94-1.03]; PNA: OR 1.02 (95\% CI: 0.98-1.07)).
   CONCLUSIONSAmong patients in California with AMI, CHF, and PNA,
   discharge on a weekend was not associated with an increased hospital

Abstract = {{The mechanism underlying the emission of phenylpropanoid volatiles is
   poorly understood. Here, we reveal the involvement of PH4, a petunia
   MYB-R2R3 transcription factor previously studied for its role in
   vacuolar acidification, in floral volatile emission.
   We used the virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) approach to knock down
   PH4 expression in petunia, measured volatile emission and internal pool
   sizes by GC-MS, and analyzed transcript abundances of scent-related
   phenylpropanoid genes in flowers.
   Silencing of PH4 resulted in a marked decrease in floral phenylpropanoid
   volatile emission, with a concurrent increase in internal pool levels.
   Expression of scent-related phenylpropanoid genes was not affected. To
   identify putative scent-related targets of PH4, we silenced PH5, a
   tonoplast-localized H+-ATPase that maintains vacuolar pH homeostasis.
   Suppression of PH5 did not yield the reduced-emission phenotype,
   suggesting that PH4 does not operate in the context of floral scent
   through regulation of vacuolar pH.
   We conclude that PH4 is a key floral regulator that integrates volatile
   production and emission processes and interconnects two essential floral
   traits - color and scent.}},

Abstract = {{Measuring heat flow can be useful in determining the amount of heat
   exchanged between the human body and the environment in order to improve
   the comfort, efficiency and sometimes, the safety of the wearer.
   Scientists use passive heat flow sensors to measure body heat exchanges
   with the environment. In recent years, several such sensors have been
   developed and concerns about their proper calibration have been
   expressed. Moreover, the existing heat flow sensors are impermeable and
   prevent evaporation which gives inaccurate results when the evaporation
   phenomenon is present. We developed a flexible heat flow sensor which is
   permeable to water vapor. This sensor takes into account the evaporation
   phenomenon and allows a better measurement of the energy during the heat
   exchange. This paper describes the textile heat flow sensor realization,
   calibration and possible applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The results of a three-dimensional finite element study of the net
   section dominated failure behaviour of pultruded open-hole specimens are
   presented. Computer models are developed using the general-purpose
   software Abaqus. Several issues are addressed in the study with respect
   to the notched plate geometry: (i) thickness of plate, (ii) transverse
   centre-to-centre spacing of holes (gauge), and (iii) distance from the
   centre of the hole to the nearest edge. The analytical results provide
   information on basic performance and the effects of these parameters on
   strength and damage tolerance performance, thereby furthering the
   current understanding of pultruded plate-to-plate connection behaviour
   under static loading. Based on the results, design recommendations for
   minimum edge distance and gauge spacing for bolts are given. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In this study, we describe the synthesis of amides and evaluate their
   use as slip additive agents in polypropylene films. The additives
   N-isopropyl-stearamide and N, N-diisopropyl-stearamide were synthesized
   and characterized and then used to prepare masterbatches. Erucamide, a
   commercial master-batch, was used as the reference standard. A 3(2)
   factorial experimental design was used to create the different
   compositions of slip additives in polymer films. The films were
   processed via flat-die extrusion and stored in an oven at a constant
   temperature of 40 degrees C for seven days. The following are the
   properties evaluated in the study: thermal decomposition temperature,
   fusion temperature, fusion enthalpy, coefficient of friction, surface
   energy, contact angle, and seal initiation temperature. The results were
   evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) at a 90 \% confidence
   interval. The analysis of the results showed that N-isopropyl stearamide
   and N, N-diisopropyl stearamide do not provide an adequate surface slip
   for polypropylene films at the conditions used in the study. In turn, at
   the same conditions, erucamide, the commercial amide, also does not
   provide the required surface energy for printing and lamination
   processes required for polypropylene films.}},

Abstract = {{Identical sensory inputs can be perceived as markedly different when
   embedded in distinct contexts. Neural responses to simple stimuli are
   also modulated by context, but the contribution of this modulation to
   the processing of natural sensory input is unclear. We measured surround
   suppression, a quintessential contextual influence, in macaque primary
   visual cortex with natural images. We found that suppression strength
   varied substantially for different images. This variability was not well
   explained by existing descriptions of surround suppression, but it was
   predicted by Bayesian inference about statistical dependencies in
   images. In this framework, surround suppression was flexible: it was
   recruited when the image was inferred to contain redundancies and
   substantially reduced in strength otherwise. Thus, our results reveal a
   gating of a basic, widespread cortical computation by inference about
   the statistics of natural input.}},

Title = {{The association between maternal antioxidant levels in midpregnancy and
   preeclampsia}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{213}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether midpregnancy antioxidant
   levels are associated with preeclampsia, overall and by timing of onset.
   STUDY DESIGN: We carried out a case-control study, nested within a
   cohort of 5337 pregnant women in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Blood samples
   obtained at 24-26 weeks were assayed for nonenzymatic antioxidant levels
   among cases of preeclampsia (n = 111) and unaffected controls (n - 441).
   We excluded women diagnosed with gestational hypertension only. We used
   logistic regression with the z-score of each antioxidant level as the
   main predictor variable for preeclampsia risk. We further stratified
   early-onset (<34 weeks) and late-onset preeclampsia and carried out
   multinomial logistic regression. Finally, we assessed associations
   between antioxidant biomarkers and timing of onset (in weeks) by Cox
   regression, with appropriate selection weights. We summed levels of
   correlated biomarkers (r(2) > 0.3) and log-transformed positively skewed
   distributions. We adjusted for body mass index, nulliparity, preexisting
   diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and proxies for ethnicity and
   socioeconomic status.
   RESULTS: The odds ratios for alpha-tocopherol, alpha-tocopherol:
   cholesterol, lycopene, lutein, and carotenoids (sum of alpha-carotene,
   beta-carotene, anhydrolutein, alpha-cryptoxanthin, and
   beta-cryptoxanthin) suggested an inverse association between antioxidant
   levels and overall preeclampsia risk; however, only lutein was
   significantly associated with overall preeclampsia in adjusted models
   (odds ratio, 0.60; 95\% confidence interval, 0.46-0.77) per SD. In
   multinomial logistic models, the relative risk ratio (RRR) estimates for
   the early-onset subgroup were farther from the null than those for the
   late-onset subgroup. The ratio of alpha-tocopherol to cholesterol and
   retinol were significantly associated with early-but not late-onset
   preeclampsia: RRRs (95\% confidence intervals) for early-onset
   preeclampsia 0.67 (0.46-0.99) and 1.61 (1.12-2.33), respectively. Lutein
   was significantly associated with both early-and late-onset subtypes in
   adjusted models; RRRs 0.53 (0.35-0.80) and 0.62 (0.47-0.82),
   respectively. Survival analyses confirmed these trends.
   CONCLUSION: Most antioxidants were more strongly associated with
   early-onset preeclampsia, suggesting that oxidative stress may play a
   greater role in the pathophysiology of early-onset preeclampsia.
   Alternatively, reverse causality may explain this pattern. Lutein was
   associated with both early-and late-onset preeclampsia and may be a
   promising nutrient to consider in preeclampsia prevention trials, if
   this finding is corroborated.}},

Journal = {{TEXAS LAW REVIEW}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-57}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The idea of property in land as the paradigm case of properly exercises
   despotic dominion over property thinking. From the perspective of
   evolving political economy, however, a land-centric model of property
   makes very little sense. Property institutions coordinate access to
   resources, and so it is reasonable to expect them to differ in ways that
   respond to the characteristics of those resources. The debate about
   whether intellectual properly (IF) is property is instructive. IF
   scholars have pursued the properly debate using a conceptual framework
   derived from common law real properly doctrines and organized around the
   practical and theoretical problems associated with properly rights in
   land, but the resources at the center of debates about the appropriate
   extent of IP-rightholder control could not be more different from land.
   Intellectual resources are routinely sliced and diced, aggregated and
   fractionated, used and reused, in ways that land is not and could not
   be. This might mean that IF is not properly, as some have argued, or it
   might mean that we have outgrown the monolithic, land-centric model that
   in the postindustrial era of wealth production, the cosmology of
   properly can no longer place terra firma at the center.
   This Article develops an account of properly as a set of
   resource-dependent legal institutions characterized by overlapping sets
   of family resemblances and then reconsiders the IF question. Properly in
   intellectual goods resembles properly in land in some respects, properly
   in natural resources in other respects, properly in corporations in
   others, and properly in intangible financial instruments in still
   others, but also systematically diverges from each of those other forms
   of properly. Legal institutions for IF must accommodate four important
   points of divergence: the different incentives of creators and
   intermediaries; the variety of ways in which intellectual goods are
   produced; the central importance of intermediation within IF ecologies;
   and the widespread use of licensing to delineate rights and obligations.}},

Abstract = {{The use of flammable refrigerants, such as R290 (propane), as an
   alternative to HCFC R22 in room split air conditioners (SACs) is being
   pursued. Concerns exist that current experience for safe application of
   R290 SACs is minimal. Conversely, there is extensive application of
   domestic and small commercial hydrocarbon refrigeration systems; this
   experience can help determine safety implications to wider use of R290
   SACs. This study uses established quantitative risk assessment methods
   to estimate frequency and severity of ignition of R600a domestic
   refrigerators, which corresponds to current experience. The
   methodologies are also applied to R290 SACs based on their particular
   characteristics to estimate the associated risk. Results show the
   frequency and severity of ignition of SACs are significantly lower than
   domestic refrigerators due to the SAC installation characteristics being
   more conducive for dispersion of leaked refrigerant and less potential
   for confinement of a flammable mixture in the event of ignition. (C)

Abstract = {{We propose a Luenberger observer for reaction-diffusion models with
   propagating front features, and for data associated with the location of
   the front over time. Such models are considered in various application
   fields, such as electrophysiology, wild-land fire propagation and tumor
   growth modeling. Drawing our inspiration from image processing methods,
   we start by proposing an observer for the eikonal-curvature equation
   that can be derived from the reaction-diffusion model by an asymptotic
   expansion. We then carry over this observer to the underlying
   reaction-diffusion equation by an ``inverse asymptotic analysis{''}, and
   we show that the associated correction in the dynamics has a stabilizing
   effect for the linearized estimation error. We also discuss the
   extension to joint state-parameter estimation by using the
   earlier-proposed ROUKF strategy. We then illustrate and assess our
   proposed observer method with test problems pertaining to
   electrophysiology modeling, including with a realistic model of cardiac
   atria. Our numerical trials show that state estimation is directly very
   effective with the proposed Luenberger observer, while specific
   strategies are needed to accurately perform parameter estimation - as is
   usual with Kalman filtering used in a nonlinear setting - and we
   demonstrate two such successful strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Waterborne diseases such as cholera continue to pose serious public
   health problems in the world today. Transmission parameters can vary
   greatly with socioeconomic class (SEC) and the availability of clean
   water. We formulate a multi-patch waterborne disease model such that
   each patch represents a particular SEC with its own water source,
   allowing individuals to move between SECs. For a 2-SEC model, we
   investigate the conditions under which each SEC is responsible for
   driving a cholera outbreak. We determine the effect of SECs on disease
   transmission dynamics by comparing the basic reproduction number of the
   2-SEC model to that of a homogeneous model that does not take SECs into
   account. We conclude by extending several results of the 2-SEC model to
   an n-SEC model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction In patients with acute leukemias hemorrhage is the most
   frequent problem. Vein thrombotic events may appear rarely but arterial
   thromboses are exceptionally rare. We present a patient with acute
   leukemia and bilateral deep leg vein thrombosis who developed an acute
   myocardial infarction (AMI) during induction chemotherapy. The etiology
   and treatment of AMI in patients with acute leukemia, which is a rare
   occurrence, is discussed.
   Case Outline In April of 2012 a 37-year-old male presented with
   bilateral deep leg vein thrombosis and malaise. Laboratory data were as
   follows: Hb 118 g/L, WBC 354x10(9)/L (with 91\% blasts in differential
   leukocyte count), platelets 60x10(9)/L. Bone marrow aspirate and
   immunophenotype revealed the presence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
   Cytogenetic analysis was as follows: 46,XY,t(4;11)(q21:q23)
   {[}2]/62-82,XY,t(4;11){[}18]. Molecular analysis showed MLL-AF4
   rearrangement. The patient was on low molecular weight heparin and
   combined chemotherapy according to protocol HyperCVAD. On day 10 after
   chemotherapy he got chest pain. Three days later AMI was diagnosed
   (creatine kinase 66 U/L, CK-MB 13U/L, troponin 1.19 mu g/L).
   Electrocardiogram showed the ST elevation in leads D1, D2, aVL, V5 and
   V6 and ``micro q{''} in D1. On echocardiography, hypokinesia of the left
   ventricle and ejection fraction of 39\% was found. After recovering from
   AMI and restoring left ventricle ejection fraction to 59\%, second
   course of HyperCVAD was given. The control bone marrow aspirate showed
   88\% of blasts but with monoblastic appearance. Flow cytometry confirmed
   a lineage switch from lymphoblasts to monoblasts. In further course of
   the disease he was treated with a variety of chemotherapeutic
   combinations without achieving remission. Eventually, palliative
   chemotherapy was administered to reduce the bulk of blasts. He died five
   months after the initial diagnosis.
   Conclusion AMI in young adults with acute leukemia is a very rare
   complication which may occur in patients with very high white blood cell
   count in addition with presence of a CD56 adhesion molecule and other
   concomitant thrombophilic factors. The treatment of AMI in patients with
   acute leukemias should include antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy,
   even with more aggressive methods depending on patient's age and
   clinical risk assessment.}},

Journal = {{FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL-GENETICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{19}},
Pages = {{180-189}},

Abstract = {{Forensic DNA samples may include the presence of PCR inhibitors, even
   after extraction and purification. Studies have demonstrated that metal
   ions, co-purified at specific concentrations, inhibit DNA
   amplifications. Metal ions are endogenous to sample types, such as bone,
   and can be introduced from environmental sources. In order to examine
   the effect of metal ions as PCR inhibitors during quantitative real-time
   PCR, 2800 M DNA was treated with 0.0025-18.750 mM concentrations of
   aluminum, calcium, copper, iron, nickel, and lead. DNA samples, both
   untreated and metal-treated, were quantified using the Quantifiler (R)
   Human DNA Quantification Kit. Quantification cycle (Cq) values for the
   Quantifiler (R) Human DNA and internal PCR control (IPC) assays were
   measured and the estimated concentrations of human DNA were obtained.
   Comparisons were conducted between metal-treated and control DNA samples
   to determine the accuracy of the quantification estimates and to test
   the efficacy of the IPC inhibition detection. This kit is most resistant
   to the presence of calcium as compared to all metals tested; the maximum
   concentration tested does not affect the amplification of the IPC or
   quantification of the sample. This kit is most sensitive to the presence
   of aluminum; concentrations greater than 0.0750 mM negatively affected
   the quantification, although the IPC assay accurately assessed the
   presence of PCR inhibition. The Quantifiler (R) Human DNA Quantification
   Kit accurately quantifies human DNA in the presence of 0.5000 mM copper,
   iron, nickel, and lead; however, the IPC does not indicate the presence
   of PCR inhibition at this concentration of these metals. Unexpectedly,
   estimates of DNA quantity in samples treated with 18.750 mM copper
   yielded values in excess of the actual concentration of DNA in the
   samples; fluorescence spectroscopy experiments indicated this increase
   was not a direct interaction between the copper metal and 6-FAM dye used
   to label the probe that targets human DNA in the Quantifiler (R) kit.
   Evidence of inhibition was observed for the human-specific assay at a
   lower metal concentration than detected by the IPC, for all metals
   examined except calcium. These results strongly suggest that
   determination of a ``true negative{''} sample should not be based solely
   on the failure of the IPC to indicate the presence of a PCR inhibitor
   and indicate that amplification of all samples should be attempted,
   regardless of the quantification results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

   that Acadian French is distinct from Laurentian French and that the Baie

   respects. A comparison of the distribution of variants and of the
   conditioning factors reveals that Acadian and Laurentian varieties have
   different future temporal reference systems. The Baie Sainte-Marie
   variety retains vestiges of earlier stages of the grammaticalization of
   one of the variants, the periphrastic future, not found in other Acadian
   varieties, thus supporting its characterization as a conservative

Abstract = {{Background: High anxiety has been reported in patients with drug
   hypersensitivity reaction (DHR); however, its relationship with the test
   results was not studied previously.
   Objective: We aimed to investigate the association of patient anxiety
   with the results of drug tests together with the other contributing
   factors.
   Methods: Sixty-seven patients were included in the study between
   November 2012 and April 2013, in whom drug tests were performed after
   clinical evaluation and application of the Penn State Worry
   Questionnaire (PSWQ).
   Results: The mean +/- standard deviation (SD) age was 43.5 +/- 12.9
   years, and 73.1\% of the patients were females. The patient group had
   significantly higher mean +/- SD PSWQ score than 35 control subjects
   without histories of DHRs and major psychiatric disorders (47.95 +/-
   14.64 versus 40.22 +/- 11.86, p = 0.008). However, the mean +/- SD. PSWQ
   score of the patients with positive drug test results was not
   significantly different from the patients with negative drug test
   results (46.06 +/- 13.41 versus 50.47 +/- 18.02, p = 0.32). Panic attack
   symptoms were more common in the reactions with positive test results
   than in the reactions with negative test results (74.0\% versus 48.9\%,
   p = 0.01). However, presence of panic attack symptoms {[}odds ratio
   (OR): 1.25, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.44-3.54; p = 0.67] was not
   found independently associated with positive test results in the
   multiple logistic regression model.
   Conclusion: Patients with DHR have high levels of anxiety; however, this
   is not related to the results of drug tests. Because panic reaction
   symptoms may accompany the objective symptoms of DHR, a complete
   clinical work-up is required before deciding whether the reaction is
   related to panic or a ``true DHR.{''}}},

Abstract = {{In spatial compatibility and Simon tasks, the response is faster when
   stimulus and response locations are on the same side than when they are
   on opposite sides. It has been shown that a spatial incompatible
   practice leads to a subsequent modulation of the Simon effect along the
   horizontal dimension. It has also been reported that this modulation
   occurs both along and across vertical and horizontal dimensions, but
   only after intensive incompatible training (600 trials). In this work,
   we show that this modulatory effect can be obtained with a smaller
   number of incompatible trials, changing the spatial arrangement of the
   vertical response keys to obtain a stronger dimensional overlap between
   the spatial codes of stimuli and response keys. The results of
   Experiment 1 showed that 80 incompatible vertical trials abolished the
   Simon effect in the same dimension. Experiment 2 showed that a
   modulation of the vertical Simon effect could be obtained after 80
   horizontal incompatible trials. Experiment 3 explored whether the
   transfer effect can also occur in a horizontal Simon task after a brief
   vertical spatial incompatibility task, and results were similar to the
   previous experiments. In conclusion, we suggest that the spatial
   arrangement between response key and stimulus locations may be critical
   to establish the short-term memory links that enable the transfer of
   learning between brief incompatible practices and the Simon effects,
   both along the vertical dimension and across vertical and horizontal
   dimensions.}},

Abstract = {{Objective:This multicenter study aims to assess long-term functional
   outcome, early and late (mesh-related) complications, and recurrences
   after laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy (LVR) for rectal prolapse
   syndromes in a large cohort of consecutive patients.Background:Long-term
   outcome data for prolapse repair are rare. A high incidence of
   mesh-related problems has been noted after transvaginal approaches using
   nonresorbable meshes.Methods:All patients treated with LVR at the
   Meander Medical Centre, Amersfoort, the Netherlands and the University
   Hospital Leuven, Belgium between January 1999 and March 2013 were
   enrolled in this study. All data were retrieved from a prospectively
   maintained database. Kaplan-Meier estimates were calculated for
   recurrences and mesh-related problems.Results:919 consecutive patients
   (869 women; 50 men) underwent LVR. A 10-year recurrence rate of 8.2\%
   (95\% confidence interval, 3.7-12.7) for external rectal prolapse repair
   was noted. Mesh-related complications were recorded in 18 patients
   (4.6\%), of which mesh erosion to the vagina occurred in 7 patients
   (1.3\%). In 5 of these patients, LVR was combined with a perineotomy.
   Both rates of fecal incontinence and obstructed defecation decreased
   significantly (P < 0.0001) after LVR compared to the preoperative
   incidence (11.1\% vs 37.5\% for incontinence and 15.6\% vs 54.0\% for
   constipation).Conclusions:LVR is safe and effective for the treatment of
   different rectal prolapse syndromes. Long-term recurrence rates are in
   line with classic types of mesh rectopexy and occurrence of mesh-related
   complications is rare.}},

Abstract = {{Christian sermons often involve discussion of Jews and Judaism, since
   they are based on the Bible: the Old Testament, which both is and isn't
   the Jewish Tanakh and the New Testament, which reflects the fraught

   preachers are not experts in Second Temple Judaism, the context of
   Jesus' ministry, nor do they have much, or indeed any, contact with
   contemporary Jews. How can they be equipped to talk about Jews and
   Judaism with respect, rather than perpetuating the traditional teaching
   of contempt'? This article discusses Christian interpretation of the Old
   Testament; Jesus the Jew, and his relationship with the Pharisees; and
   the Christian doctrine of supersessionism.}},

Abstract = {{We present source models for the August 2014 Murmuri (Dehloran)
   earthquake sequence in the Zagros Mountains of Iran. An M(w)6.2
   mainshock was followed by an aftershock sequence containing five events
   of M-w >= 5.4. Models of P and SH waveforms show that all events had
   dominantly thrust-faulting mechanisms, and had centroid depths that
   place them within the thick sedimentary sequence, above the crystalline
   basement. The combination of our estimated focal mechanisms, relative
   relocations of the event hypocentres and the surface displacement
   patterns observed using InSAR imply that the mainshock and largest
   aftershock ruptured different fault planes and both contributed to the
   surface deformation. The fault planes both slipped in horizontally
   elongated patches, possibly due to rheological layering limiting the
   updip and downdip extent of rupture. The slip vector of the Murmuri
   mainshock implies that the decollement beneath the Lorestan Arc is
   weaker than any such feature beneath the Dezful Embayment, providing an
   explanation for the plan-view sinuosity of the range-front of the Zagros
   Mountains.}},

Journal = {{CHEMOSPHERE}},

Volume = {{138}},
Pages = {{751-757}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Sesquiterpenes are plant-produced hydrocarbons with important ecological
   functions in plant-to-plant and plant-to-insect communication, but due
   to their high reactivity they can also play a significant role in
   atmospheric chemistry. So far, there is little information of gas/liquid
   phase partition coefficients (Henry's law constants) and their
   temperature dependencies for sesquiterpenes, but this information is
   needed for quantitative simulation of the release of sesquiterpenes from
   plants and modeling atmospheric reactions in different phases. In this
   study, we estimated Henry's law constants (Hp,) and their temperature
   responses for 12 key plant sesquiterpenes with varying structure
   (aliphatic, mono-, bi- and tricyclic sesquiterpenes). At 25 degrees C,
   Henry's law constants varied 1.4-fold among different sesquiterpenes,
   and the values were within the range previously observed for monocyclic
   monoterpenes. Hp, of sesquiterpenes exhibited a high rate of increase,
   on average ca. 1.5-fold with a 10 degrees C increase in temperature
   (Q10). The values of Q10 varied 1.2-fold among different sesquiterpenes.
   Overall, these data demonstrate moderately high variation in H-pc values
   and H-pc temperature responses among different sesquiterpenes. We argue
   that these variations can importantly alter the emission kinetics of
   sesquiterpenes from plants. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An actively cooled vascular polymer matrix composite containing 3.0\%
   channel volume fraction retains greater than 90\% flexural stiffness
   when exposed continuously to 325 degrees C environmental temperature.
   Non-cooled controls suffered complete structural failure through thermal
   degradation under the same conditions. Glass-epoxy composites (T-g = 152
   degrees C) manufactured by vacuum assisted resin transfer molding
   contain microchannel networks of two different architectures optimized
   for thermal and mechanical performance. Microchannels are fabricated by
   vaporization of poly(lactide) fibers treated with tin(II) oxalate
   catalyst that are incorporated into the fiber preform prior to resin
   infiltration. Flexural modulus, material temperature, and heat removal
   rates are measured during four-point bending testing as a function of
   environmental temperature and coolant flow rate. Simulations validate
   experimental measurements and provide insight into the thermal behavior.
   Vascular specimens with only 1.5\% channel volume fraction centered at
   the neutral bending axis also retained over 80\% flexural stiffness at
   325 degrees C environmental temperature. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Rich RNA Structure Landscapes Revealed by Mutate-and-Map Analysis}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Landscapes exhibiting multiple secondary structures arise in natural RNA
   molecules that modulate gene expression, protein synthesis, and viral.
   We report herein that high-throughput chemical experiments can isolate
   an RNA's multiple alternative secondary structures as they are
   stabilized by systematic mutagenesis (mutate-and-map, M-2) and that a
   computational algorithm, REEFFIT, enables unbiased reconstruction of
   these states' structures and populations. In an in silico benchmark on
   non-coding RNAs with complex landscapes, M-2-REEFFIT recovers 95\% of
   RNA helices present with at least 25\% population while maintaining a
   low false discovery rate (10\%) and conservative error estimates. In
   experimental benchmarks, M-2-REEFFIT recovers the structure landscapes
   of a 35-nt MedLoop hairpin, a 110-nt 16S rRNA four-way junction with an
   excited state, a 25-nt bistable hairpin, and a 112-nt three-state
   adenine riboswitch with its expression platform, molecules whose
   characterization previously required expert mutational analysis and
   specialized NMR or chemical mapping experiments. With this validation,
   M-2-REEFFIT enabled tests of whether artificial RNA sequences might
   exhibit complex landscapes in the absence of explicit design. An
   artificial flavin mononucleotide riboswitch and a randomly generated RNA
   sequence are found to interconvert between three or more states,
   including structures for which there was no design, but that could be
   stabilized through mutations. These results highlight the likely
   pervasiveness of rich landscapes with multiple secondary structures in
   both natural and artificial RNAs and demonstrate an automated
   chemical/computational route for their empirical characterization.}},

Abstract = {{Since around 2003, the number and extent of studies into accounting
   history and religion has increased significantly from their prior
   scarcity. This growing interest in the junction of accounting, religion
   and theology recognizes the social and economic importance of belief
   systems and religious institutions. Yet, publications are unevenly
   distributed, with a focus on a micro-perspective - analysing the manner
   in which accounting is practised within organizations. Few studies take
   a macro-perspective to consider how religion influenced (or potentially
   could influence) accounting outside of religious institutions. The
   purpose of this article is to review the contributions in the last three
   decades, to highlight the topics that remain relatively unexplored, and
   thus to encourage more research into accounting history and religion.
   Opportunities for extending knowledge include: comparative studies,
   studies of countries, people and faiths that have been left largely
   unexplored, and studies from theologians concerning key concepts (such
   as ethics) which impact academic understandings, as well as the
   practical application, of accounting.}},

Abstract = {{This paper assesses the impact of modern varieties adoption on farmers'
   welfare and crop biodiversity conserved in-situ. Using nationally
   representative data collected in 2009/2010 in Uganda, an endogenous
   switching regression model estimates the net economic and environmental
   effects of switching from local landraces to modem species. Results show
   that, after controlling for market and agro-ecological factors, the
   local varieties perform better than modem ones in marginalized and
   climatic vulnerable areas. Crop biodiversity shows to play a fundamental
   role in farmers' risk minimizing strategies when the available modern
   varieties are not adaptable to the local context and not supported by
   the required level of agro-intensification. Rural development policies
   should consider the heterogeneity in the adoption returns and support
   diversity conservation as a national strategic asset for a suitable
   bioprospecting and a best-fitting agricultural system implementation.

Abstract = {{In this paper we introduce the Laguerre polynomials as mean square
   solutions of random differential equations. The study is based on the
   construction of an infinite random power series solution which becomes a
   random polynomial under certain conditions to be satisfied by the single
   involved random coefficient, denoted by A. This approach allows us to
   introduce the concept of Laguerre polynomials associated to the random
   variable A retaining their deterministic definition when the probability
   mass of A is concentrated in a non-negative integer. As a result, we
   provide a natural way to extend the deterministic Laguerre polynomials
   to the random framework. In addition, the main statistical functions of
   the approximate solution stochastic process obtained by truncation of
   the exact power series solution, which generates random Laguerre
   polynomials, are also given. Several illustrative examples are provided.}},

Abstract = {{A new synthesis approach for obtaining fluorescent carbon dots (CDs)
   based on UV irradiation of carbohydrates was developed. The
   photochemical synthesis pathway allows the formation of water soluble
   CDs of analytical usefulness within one min. CDs obtained by
   photochemical treatment from the sucrose/NaOH/poly(ethylene glycol)
   system are monodisperse with an average size of 8 nm as determined by
   transmission electron microscopy. A dramatic increase in the CDs
   fluorescence (turn on) is observed when H2O2 is added. The decrease in
   CDs size occurring by the action of highly oxidant OH radicals gives
   rise to confinement of emissive energy traps and, in turn, to
   fluorescence enhancement. Antioxidants such as ascorbic acid and
   glutathione inhibit the photochemical reaction giving rise to a decrease
   in fluorescence of the CDs/H2O2 system (turn on-oft). The detection
   limit was 5 mu M H2O2 and the repeatability expressed as the relative
   standard deviation was 3.8\% (N=7). The photochemical synthesis of CDs
   allows building a green, low-cost, safe and fast assay for the detection
   of H2O2 and antioxidants. An application of the novel fluorescent
   nanoprobe to H2O2 detection in contact lens cleaning solutions is
   performed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Samples of manganese-rich rock containing two compositional varieties of
   tokyoite in association with noelbensonite were retrieved from a drill
   core obtained from the Postmasburg area in the Northern Cape Province of
   South Africa. The samples consist of fine-grained braunite, hematite,
   and hausmannite. Within this material abundant vugs are observed that
   are filled with witherite, baryte, and barytocalcite. In addition,
   As-rich tokyoite, tokyoite, and noelbensonite occur in the center of the
   vugs, in fine aggregates 0.1 to 1 mm in size. Individual As-rich
   tokyoite grains are typically 20-200 mu m in size. The outer walls of
   the vugs are lined with microcrystalline K-feldspar, witherite, and/or
   serandite. Textural evidence of the Ba-rich mineral phases in
   association with As-rich tokyoite suggest an epigenetic mode of
   formation of the observed assemblages, caused by V- and As-bearing
   alkali-rich fluids interacting with pre-existing Mn-rich minerals.
   Electron microprobe analysis (EMPA), electron backscatter diffraction
   analysis (EBSD), and Raman spectroscopy show that the As-rich tokyoite
   is a mineral belonging to the brackebuschite mineral group. Its measured
   mineral composition corresponds to the formula
   (Ba1.92Sr0.05Pb0.03)(Sigma 2.00)(Mn0.983+Fe0.023+)(Sigma
   1.00){[}(As1.050V0.950)(Sigma 2.00)O-8)]OH. Electron backscatter
   diffraction analysis results point to a monoclinic, P2(1)/m space group,
   with cell parameters a 9.121 angstrom, b 6.142 angstrom, c 7.838
   angstrom, alpha = gamma = 90 degrees, beta = 112 degrees, Z = 2. The
   structure is therefore similar to gamagarite. Raman spectra of As-rich
   tokyoite were compared to spectra of arsenbrackebuschite and
   arsentsumebite, and those of noelbensonite to spectra of hennomartinite
   and lawsonite. The indexing of Raman peaks in As-rich tokyoite, by
   similarity with arsentsumebite, suggests a possible ordering of the AsO4
   and VO4 tetrahedra. This observation, correlated with mineral chemistry
   and specifically an As:V ratio of similar to 1:1, suggest that the
   As-rich tokyoite may in fact represent a possible new mineral with
   ordering of As and V at tetrahedral positions, or at least an unknown As
   analogue of tokyoite.}},

Abstract = {{The Salmonella enterica opvAB operon is a horizontally-acquired locus
   that undergoes phase variation under Dam methylation control. The OpvA
   and OpvB proteins form intertwining ribbons in the inner membrane.
   Synthesis of OpvA and OpvB alters lipopolysaccharide O-antigen chain
   length and confers resistance to bacteriophages 9NA (Siphoviridae), Det7
   (Myoviridae), and P22 (Podoviridae). These phages use the O-antigen as
   receptor. Because opvAB undergoes phase variation, S. enterica cultures
   contain subpopulations of opvAB(OFF) and opvAB(ON) cells. In the
   presence of a bacteriophage that uses the O-antigen as receptor, the
   opvAB(OFF) subpopulation is killed and the opvAB(ON) subpopulation is
   selected. Acquisition of phage resistance by phase variation of
   O-antigen chain length requires a payoff: opvAB expression reduces
   Salmonella virulence. However, phase variation permits resuscitation of
   the opvAB(OFF) subpopulation as soon as phage challenge ceases.
   Phenotypic heterogeneity generated by opvAB phase variation thus
   preadapts Salmonella to survive phage challenge with a fitness cost that
   is transient only.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate the effect of implementing real-time audiovisual
   feedback with and without postevent debriefing on survival and quality
   of cardiopulmonary resuscitation quality at in-hospital cardiac arrest.
   Design: A two-phase, multicentre prospective cohort study.
   Setting: Three UK hospitals, all part of one National Health Service
   Acute Trust.
   Patients: One thousand three hundred and ninety-five adult patients who
   sustained an in-hospital cardiac arrest at the study hospitals and were
   treated by hospital emergency teams between November 2009 and May 2013.
   Interventions: During phase 1, quality of cardiopulmonary resuscitation
   and patient outcomes were measured with no intervention implemented.
   During phase 2, staff at hospital 1 received real-time audiovisual
   feedback, whereas staff at hospital 2 received real-time audiovisual
   feedback supplemented by postevent debriefing. No intervention was
   implemented at hospital 3 during phase 2.
   Measurements and Main Results: The primary outcome was return of
   spontaneous circulation. Secondary endpoints included other
   patient-focused outcomes, such as survival to hospital discharge, and
   process-focused outcomes, such as chest compression depth. Random-effect
   logistic and linear regression models, adjusted for baseline patient
   characteristics, were used to analyze the effect of the interventions on
   study outcomes. In comparison with no intervention, neither real-time
   audiovisual feedback (adjusted odds ratio, 0.62; 95\% CI, 0.31-1.22; p =
   0.17) nor real-time audiovisual feedback supplemented by postevent
   debriefing (adjusted odds ratio, 0.65; 95\% CI, 0.35-1.21; p = 0.17) was
   associated with a statistically significant improvement in return of
   spontaneous circulation or any process-focused outcome. Despite this,
   there was evidence of a system-wide improvement in phase 2, leading to
   improvements in return of spontaneous circulation (adjusted odds ratio,
   1.87; 95\% CI, 1.06-3.30; p = 0.03) and process-focused outcomes.
   Conclusions: Implementation of real-time audiovisual feedback with or
   without postevent debriefing did not lead to a measured improvement in
   patient or process-focused outcomes at individual hospital sites.
   However, there was an unexplained system-wide improvement in return of
   spontaneous circulation and process-focused outcomes during the second
   phase of the study.}},

Abstract = {{Maintaining an optimal hydration status is necessary for metabolism and
   water is therefore a key nutrient. Water entries are divided between
   endogenous water from oxidative metabolism and oral water intakes from
   beverages and water contained in food. The kidney ensures water
   homeostasis by concentrating and diluting urine under the influence of
   anti-diuretic hormone. Adequate intakes for water were defined by the
   Institute of Medicine and the European Food Safety Authority on the
   basis of observed water intakes in population subgroups, desirable water
   volumes per 1 000 kcal (>= 1.01/1 000 kcal) and desirable osmolality
   values in urine. A moderate dehydration can be accompanied by impaired
   cognitive and physical performances and chronic dehydration promotes
   many diseases, including kidney stones and urinary tract infections.
   Children and seniors are particularly at risk of dehydration. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Aquatic environment corresponds to more than 70\% of the Earth's surface
   mostly still unknown and unexplored. Underwater wireless sensor networks
   have recently been proposed as a way to observe and explore these
   environments. However, the efficient data delivery is still a
   challenging issue in these networks because of the impairments of the
   acoustic transmission. To cope with this problem, we present a novel
   geographic forwarding protocol and two topology control mechanisms for
   long-term non-time-critical underwater sensor networks. The proposed
   routing protocol considers the anycast network architecture in the data
   forwarding process. The proposed centralized topology control (CTC) and
   the distributed topology control (DTC) mechanisms organize the network
   via depth adjustment of some nodes. Simulation results show that with
   these mechanisms, the data packet delivery ratio achieves more than 90\%
   even in hard and difficult scenarios of very sparse or very dense
   networks, and the end-to-end delay and energy consumption per delivered
   packet are reduced. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Corn (Zea mays L.) seeding depth recommendations typically range from
   3.8 to 5.1 cm, but few studies have been conducted in recent years. We
   conducted field-scale studies on four farms at four equally spaced
   seeding depths (2.5-6.4 cm) in New York in 2013 and 2014 to validate
   seeding depth recommendations across different soil conditions. Seeding
   depth affected corn populations and yield in 6 of 8 site-years but
   optimum seeding depth differed across sites and years within sites.
   Yield responses to seeding depth were small on well-drained silt loams
   with reduced tillage (similar to 3\% advantage at 3.8 vs. 2.5 and 5.1 cm
   in 2013 and no difference in 2014), and on somewhat poorly drained silty
   clay loams under no-till (similar to 5.5\% difference with maximum
   yields predicted at similar to 4.2 cm in both years). Yield responses to
   seeding depth were larger on a somewhat poorly drained silt loam with
   moldboard plowing (9-15\% advantage for 6.4 vs. 5.1 and 3.8 cm,
   respectively; maximum yields predicted at >5.78 cm in both years). On
   somewhat poorly drained silt loams with reduced tillage, populations had
   a positive quadratic response (maximum populations predicted at 5.45 cm)
   and yield had a positive linear response in 2013, but plant populations
   had a negative linear response and yield had no response in 2014.
   Weather conditions aft er planting affected yield responses
   inconsistently, but the data indicate that seeding depths should
   probably range from 3.8 to 5.1 cm on silty clay loams and from 3.8 to
   6.4 cm on silt loams.}},

Abstract = {{We present a theory of abstraction for the framework of parameterised

   Boolean equation systems can be used to solve a variety of problems in
   verification. We study the capabilities of the abstraction theory by
   comparing it to an abstraction theory for Generalised Kripke modal
   Transition Systems (GTSs). We show that for model checking the modal
   mu-calculus, our abstractions can be exponentially more succinct than
   GTSs and our theory is as complete as the GTS framework for abstraction.
   Furthermore, we investigate the completeness of our theory irrespective
   of the encoded decision problem. We illustrate the potential of our
   theory through case studies using the first-order modal mu-calculus and
   a real-time extension thereof, conducted using a prototype
   implementation of a new syntactic transformation for parameterised

Abstract = {{Paresis and paralysis are uncommon problems in sheep but are likely to
   prompt farmers to seek veterinary advice. A thorough and logical
   approach can aid in determining the cause of the problem and
   highlighting the benefit of veterinary involvement. While this may not

   formulating preventive measures and avoid the costs - both in economic
   and in welfare terms - of misdirected treatment. Distinguishing between
   central and peripheral lesions is most important, as the relative
   prognoses are markedly different, and this can often be achieved with
   minimal equipment. This article describes an approach to performing a
   neurological examination of the ovine trunk and limbs, the ancillary

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{There is a trend toward operative treatment for certain types of
   clavicle fractures and these are usually treated with plate
   osteosynthesis. The subcutaneous location of the clavicle makes the
   plate fit important, but the clavicle has a complex shape, which varies
   greatly between individuals and hence standard plates often have a poor
   fit. Using computed tomography (CT) based design, the plate contour and
   screw positioning can be optimized to the actual case. A method for
   patient-specific plating using design based on CT-data, additive
   manufacturing (AM), and postprocessing was initially evaluated through
   three case studies, and the plate fit on the reduced fracture was tested
   during surgery (then replaced by commercial plates). In all three cases,
   the plates had an adequate fit on the reduced fracture. The time span
   from CT scan of the fracture to final implant was two days. An approach
   to achieve functional design and screw-hole positioning was initiated.
   These initial trials of patient-specific clavicle plating using AM
   indicate the potential for a smoother plate with optimized screw
   positioning. Further, the approach facilitates the surgeon's work and
   operating time can be saved.}},

Title = {{A socio-technical approach to increasing the battery lifetime of

Abstract = {{Off-grid solar photovoltaics (PV) are promoted as an economical
   renewable energy system for providing electricity in remote locations
   far from the grid. However, without on-going maintenance, the
   performance of these systems will diminish due to battery deterioration
   leaving them unable to provide the service they were initially designed
   for. This paper presents analysis and results from a four week
   cross-disciplinary investigative study carried out in September 2012
   into the performance of off-grid PV in health centres and schools in
   rural communities in Rwanda. A socio-technical approach was taken to
   understand the reasons for failure. A strategy was subsequently
   developed to influence user behaviour and increase the PV array size to
   reduce capacity shortage through the year and improve the lifetime of
   the lead acid batteries found on these systems. According to the results
   obtained, the total costs to implement off-grid PV systems can be
   reduced. Furthermore, the proposed strategy reduces the operating costs
   of PV below that of a diesel generator according to a projection of
   prices found in Rwanda which is important in a donor led installation
   model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successfully applied in
   humans for the study of many complex phenotypes. However, identification
   of the genetic determinants of hearing in adults has been hampered, in
   part, by the relative inability to control for environmental factors
   that might affect hearing throughout the lifetime, as well as a large
   degree of phenotypic heterogeneity. These and other factors have limited
   the number of large-scale studies performed in humans that have
   identified candidate genes that contribute to the etiology of this
   complex trait. To address these limitations, we performed a GWAS
   analysis using a set of inbred mouse strains from the Hybrid Mouse
   Diversity Panel. Among 99 strains characterized, we observed
   approximately two-fold to five-fold variation in hearing at six
   different frequencies, which are differentiated biologically from each
   other by the location in the cochlea where each frequency is registered.
   Among all frequencies tested, we identified a total of nine significant
   loci, several of which contained promising candidate genes for follow-up
   study. Taken together, our results indicate the existence of both genes
   that affect global cochlear function, as well as anatomical-and
   frequency-specific genes, and further demonstrate the complex nature of
   mammalian hearing variation.}},

Abstract = {{Different authors have modelled myofascial tissue connectivity over a
   distance using cadaveric models, but invivo models are scarce. The aim
   of this study was to evaluate the relationship between pelvic motion and
   deep fascia displacement in the medial gastrocnemius (MG). Deep fascia
   displacement of the MG was evaluated through automatic tracking with an
   ultrasound. Angular variation of the pelvis was determined by 2D
   kinematic analysis. The average maximum fascia displacement and pelvic
   motion were 1.501 +/- 0.78mm and 6.55 +/- 2.47 degrees, respectively.
   The result of a simple linear regression between fascia displacement and
   pelvic motion for three task executions by 17 individuals was r=0.791
   (P<0.001). Moreover, hamstring flexibility was related to a lower
   anterior tilt of the pelvis (r=0.544, P<0.024) and a lower deep fascia
   displacement of the MG (r=0.449, P<0.042). These results support the
   concept of myofascial tissue connectivity over a distance in an invivo
   model, reinforce the functional concept of force transmission through
   synergistic muscle groups, and grant new perspectives for the role of
   fasciae in restricting movement in remote zones.}},

   colonies began to compile joint reports for an expanding reading public.
   In this respect, its focus will be primarily on the use of the
   inter-colonial telegraph, and upon two influential observers operating
   in different Australian colonies: Charles Todd in South Australia and
   Clement Wragge in Queensland. In order to explore the development of
   colonial weather networks in the age of the telegraph, the article
   examines the protracted press and professional controversy that arose
   between these two media personalities, and maps the transformation of
   weather telegrams into news by late colonial newspapers.}},

Title = {{Effects of shifts in food deprivation on consummatory successive
   negative contrast}},
Journal = {{LEARNING AND MOTIVATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {{11-21}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Rats exposed to a downshift from a large reward (32\% sucrose) to a
   small reward (4\% sucrose) show less consummatory behavior than
   unshifted rats always exposed to the small reward-an effect called
   consummatory successive negative contrast (cSNC). Four experiments
   studied the effects of shifts in deprivation level between preshift and
   postshift sessions on the size of the cSNC effect. This manipulation is
   designed to test the general proposition that the cSNC effect depends
   not only on external factors (e.g., reward disparity), but also on the
   internal state of the organism either at the time it first experiences
   the rewards (incentive learning), at the time of reward downshift
   (reward need), or as a function of the transition of states from pre- to
   postshift sessions (state dependency). Experiments 1-2 adjusted
   deprivation level during a 10-day interval between the last preshift and
   first postshift sessions. During this interval, food deprivation was
   either maintained or changed (increased or reduced) relative to preshift
   sessions. Experiments 3-4 maintained all animals at 81-85\% of their ad
   lib weight during the entire experiment, but they were either fed before
   each session (nondeprivation condition) or fed after the session
   (deprivation condition). This procedure avoided the 10-day interval used
   in previous experiments. In three of the four experiments, the size of
   the cSNC effect increased when animals were deprived while exposed to
   the large reward (32\% sucrose) during preshift sessions, independently
   of postshift deprivation conditions. The remaining experiment yielded
   inconclusive results. Of the three tested hypothesis, the incentive
   learning view received the strongest support. According to this view,
   the incentive value of the large reward is partly determined by the
   deprivation state of the organism at the time of learning. (C) 2015

   apparatus were conducted in the Wanjiazhai Reservoir in the upper Yellow
   River for approximately four months during the winter of 2012-2013. The
   results showed that the recorded ice thickness agreed with the
   drill-hole measurements. The differences between the recorded and the
   drill-hole data are between 0 and 0.02 m. The new apparatus can
   continuously and automatically operate in freshwater ice. It provides an
   effective method for monitoring the ice thickness and temperature

Abstract = {{Laparoscopic surgery has been shown to offer more advantages than open
   surgery for the treatment of gastric cancer. However, the perioperative
   immune responses after laparoscopic surgery remain largely unexplored.
   Here, we analyzed the immunity of gastric cancer patients treated by
   laparoscopy-assisted gastrectomy (LAG) or open gastrectomy (OG) with D2
   dissection. Seventy patients were randomized into LAG and OG groups. The
   operative details and postoperative outcomes of the two groups were
   compared. The immune factors were measured preoperatively as well as on
   the first, third, and seventh postoperative days (POD). Our results
   indicate that there was no significant difference between two groups in
   clinical characteristics. The profiles of white blood cells,
   neutrophils, lymphocytes, as well as the lymphocyte subpopulations,
   including T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, CD4(+) T cells, and CD8(+) T
   cells were similar in the LAG and the OG groups. Only the natural killer
   cell counts were significantly higher in LAG-treated patients than in
   OG-treated ones on POD7. Moreover, no statistical differences were found
   between the two groups with respect to the levels of perioperative
   cytokines, including IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. However,
   compared with the OG group, most of the immune factors in the LAG group
   had trends to return to preoperative levels on POD7. Our study
   demonstrates that the immune function of LAG-treated patients showed
   patterns similar to that of OG-treated patients, although larger
   prospective multicenter trials are needed to further evaluate the
   immunological status of LAG.}},

Title = {{Pituitary gland volume and psychosocial stress among children at
   elevated risk for schizophrenia}},
Journal = {{PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{3281-3292}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background. Pituitary volume enlargements have been observed among
   individuals with first-episode psychosis. These abnormalities are
   suggestive of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity,
   which may contribute to the development of psychosis. However, the
   extent to which these abnormalities characterize individuals at elevated
   risk for schizophrenia prior to illness onset is currently unclear, as
   volume increases, decreases and no volume differences have all been
   reported relative to controls. The current study aimed to determine
   whether antipsychotic-naive, putatively at-risk children who present
   multiple antecedents of schizophrenia (ASz) or a family history of
   illness (FHx) show pituitary volume abnormalities relative to typically
   developing (TD) children. An additional aim was to explore the
   association between pituitary volume and experiences of psychosocial
   stress.
   Method. ASz (n = 30), FHx (n = 22) and TD (n = 32) children were
   identified at age 9-12 years using a novel community-screening procedure
   or as relatives of individuals with schizophrenia. Measures of pituitary
   volume and psychosocial stress were obtained at age 11-14 years.
   Results. Neither ASz nor FHx children showed differences in pituitary
   volume relative to TD children. Among FHx children only, pituitary
   volume was negatively associated with current distress relating to
   negative life events and exposure to physical punishment.
   Conclusions. The lack of pituitary volume abnormalities among ASz and
   FHx children is consistent with our previous work demonstrating that
   these children are not characterized by elevated diurnal cortisol
   levels. The findings imply that these biological markers of HPA axis
   hyperactivity, observed in some older samples of high-risk individuals,
   may emerge later, more proximally to disease onset.}},

Abstract = {{In the last decades, awareness regarding personal care products (PCP),
   i.e. synthetic organic chemicals frequently used in cosmetic and
   hygienic products, has become a forward-looking issue, due to their
   persistency in the environment and their potential multi-organ toxicity
   in both human and wildlife. Seafood is one of the most significant food
   commodities in the world and, certainly, one of the most prone to
   bioaccumulation of PCP, what can consequently lead to human exposure,
   especially for coastal population, where its consumption is more marked.
   The aim of this work was to evaluate the co-occurrence of musk
   fragrances and UV-filters in both seafood and macroalgae collected in
   different European hotspots (areas with high levels of pollution, highly
   populated and near wastewater treatment plants). Despite the fact that
   UV-filters were detected in three different kind of samples (mussel,
   mullet, and clam), in all cases they were below the limit of
   quantification. Galaxolide (HHCB) and tonalide (AHTN) were the musk
   fragrances most frequently detected and quantified in samples from the
   European hotspots. Cashmeran (DPMI) was also detected in most samples
   but only quantified in two of them (flounder/herring and mullet). The
   highest levels of HHCB and AHTN were found in mussels from Po estuary.

Abstract = {{Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a syndrome that can be
   initiated by a myriad of medical, surgical, and obstetric disorders.
   Also known as consumptive coagulopathy, DIC is a common contributor to
   maternal morbidity and mortality and is associated with up to 25\% of
   maternal deaths. The etiopathogenesis of DIC is complex and currently
   thought to be initiated by tissue factor or thromboplastin, which is
   released from trophoblastic or fetal tissue, or maternal decidua or
   endothelium. Tissue factor activates the coagulation sequence to cause
   fibrin clotting and its dissolution by the fibrinolysin system. The
   result of this process can range from mild, clinically insignificant
   laboratory derangements to marked coagulopathy with bleeding at sites of
   minimal trauma. Although clinical recognition varies by disease
   severity, several organizations have attempted to standardize the
   diagnosis through development of scoring systems. Several
   importantalbeit not necessarily commonobstetric disorders associated
   with DIC include placental abruption, amniotic fluid embolism, sepsis
   syndrome, and acute fatty liver of pregnancy. More common disorders
   include severe preeclampsia, hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low
   platelet count syndrome, and massive obstetric hemorrhage. Importantly,
   many of these disorders either cause or are associated with substantive
   obstetric hemorrhage. Treatment of DIC is centered on two principles.
   The first is identification and treatment of the underlying disorder.
   Because many women with consumptive coagulopathy also have massive
   hemorrhage, the second tenet of treatment is that obstetric
   complications such as uterine atony or lacerations must be controlled
   simultaneously with prompt blood and component replacement for a
   salutary outcome.}},

   Study to investigate the impacts of the Great Recession on the health of
   mothers. We focus on a wide range of physical and mental health
   outcomes, as well as health behaviour. We find that increases in the
   unemployment rate decrease self-reported health status and increase
   smoking and drug use. We also find evidence of heterogeneous impacts.
   Disadvantaged mothers - African American, Hispanic, less educated and
   unmarried - experience greater deterioration in their health than

Abstract = {{The effects of water temperature (14, 18, 22 and 26 degrees C) and age
   (2-y-old, 6.7 g; 3-y-old, 25.7 g) on the gastrointestinal evacuation
   (GIE) time and apparent nutrient digestibility coefficients (ADC) for
   greenlip abalone (Haliotis laevigata). GIE time of greenlip abalone was
   evaluated using a marker diet containing chromic oxide and the total
   faecal collection technique. Additionally, GIE values were compared from
   samples collected from abalone that were sampled once only or repeatedly
   to compare the rigour of each method. GIE time was also assessed using
   radiography. GIE times were significantly affected by water temperature
   (P < 0.001) and age (P < 0.05). GIE times decreased for both age classes
   with increasing temperatures, and the GIE time of 2-y-olds was
   significantly faster than for 3-y-olds. GIE times never exceeded 60 h.
   There was no significant effect of either factor on the duration that
   the marker diet was voided, suggesting that differences in GIE times are
   due to factors other than the transit of feed through the intestine. Dry
   matter ADCs were not affected by temperature (P > 0.05) but were
   affected by age (P < 0.001; 2-y-old <3-y-old). Protein and energy ADCs
   were not affected by temperature or age. Results may be used to predict
   purging times and also indicate that further investigations into feeding
   frequencies are recommended. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Church of the SubGenius, usually regarded as a ``parody

   on resistance to a consumerist conspiracy. This article draws on Guy
   Debord's contention that the capitalist spectacle has replaced the
   religious worldview, rendering everyday life mysterious and the
   acquisition of goods compulsive, and argues that, when stripped of
   science fiction tropes, the Church of the SubGenius' vision of a world
   in the grip of a totalitarian materialist conspiracy is largely
   realistic. Yet, this ``rational{''} rejection of consumerism is
   undermined by the portrayal of J. R. ``Bob{''} Dobbs, the salesman
   messiah, based (partly) on L. Ron Hubbard, and the science fictions
   trappings of the extraterrestrial conspiracy. It is argued that humor is
   the key to making sense of the Church, as it integrates the bad taste,
   shock value, and contrariness of the religion into an effective
   spiritual path of resistance.}},

Title = {{Impact of preventive therapy on the risk of breast cancer among women

Journal = {{BREAST}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{There are three main ways in which women can be identified as being at
   high risk of breast cancer i) family history of breast and/or ovarian
   cancer, which includes genetic factors ii) mammographically identified
   high breast density, and iii) certain types of benign breast disease.
   The last category is the least common, but in some ways the easiest one
   for which treatment can be offered, because these women have already
   entered into the treatment system. The highest risk is seen in women
   with lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), but this is very rare. More
   common is atypical hyperplasia (AH), which carries a 4-5-fold risk of
   breast cancer as compared to general population. Even more common is
   hyperplasia of the usual type and carries a roughly two-fold increased
   risk. Women with aspirated cysts are also at increased risk of
   subsequent breast cancer.
   Tamoxifen has been shown to be particularly effective in preventing
   subsequent breast cancer in women with AH, with a more than 70\%
   reduction in the P1 trial and a 60\% reduction in IBIS-I. The aromatase
   inhibitors (AIs) also are highly effective for AH and LCIS. There are no
   published data on the effectiveness of tamoxifen or the AIs for breast
   cancer prevention in women with hyperplasia of the usual type, or for
   women with aspirated cysts.
   Improving diagnostic consistency, breast cancer risk prediction and
   education of physicians and patients regarding therapeutic prevention in
   women with benign breast disease may strengthen breast cancer prevention
   efforts. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Pig slurry use as soil fertilizer is a common practice in southern
   Brazil. In spite of the benefits of reusing waste, this practice poses
   serious environmental risks. Microbiological indicators of soil quality
   are very sensitive and allow soil environment conditions to be
   monitored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the microbiological
   quality of pasture soils with different histories of successive use of
   pig slurry. Determinations were made of C content in the microbial
   biomass, soil microbial respiration, metabolic quotient (qCO(2)),
   activity of the enzymes beta-glycosidase and urease, and fluorescein
   diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis in grazing areas under the use of pig slurry
   for two (A2) and 14 years (A14) and in a native forest (NF) area. The
   successive use of pig slurry on pasture did not affect C biomass and
   soil microbial respiration, which varied according to the time of
   collection. The qCO2 was not affected by the use of pig slurry in the
   soil. Soil enzymatic activity was affected by the use of pig slurry;
   urease and FDA were sensitive in detecting differences in soil activity
   with the use of pig slurry, whereas the beta-glycosidase enzyme did not
   allow differentiation among the areas studied.}},

Abstract = {{Intestinal ischemia/reperfusion injury can be caused by surgical
   procedures and inflammatory bowel disease. It is normally associated
   with the increased production of free radicals and changes in the
   enteric nervous system.
   Given the antioxidant and neuroprotective properties of resveratrol, the
   present study assessed its influence on oxidative stress in the
   intestinal wall and the morphology of myenteric neurons in the ileum of
   rats subjected to ischemia/reperfusion.
   Resveratrol was orally administered daily at a dose of 10 mg/kg for 5
   days. Changes in the ileum response to ischemia after 45 min were
   investigated followed by 3 h reperfusion. Lipoperoxide and carbonylated
   protein levels, and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione
   reductase, glutathione peroxidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
   were measured following ischemia/reperfusion injury.
   The density and morphometry of the general neuronal population,
   nitrergic neurons and glial cells, and morphometry of VIP varicosities
   in the ileum were also studied. Lipoperoxide and carbonylated protein
   levels were 171 and 40 \% higher during the ischemia/reperfusion,
   respectively, compared to control cohorts, and resveratrol attenuated
   these values. The glutathione ratio was 64 \% lower during
   ischemia/reperfusion, compared to control cohorts. Resveratrol increased
   the reduced/oxidized glutathione ratio, attenuated the changes in the
   activity of the antioxidant enzymes and the detrimental morphologic
   changes caused by ischemia/reperfusion in the general neuronal
   population and nitrergic neurons.
   Oral treatment with resveratrol reduced the oxidative stress in the
   ileum and attenuated the morphologic changes that occurred in the
   myenteric plexus of the ileum in rats subjected to ischemia/reperfusion.}},

Title = {{Molecularly imprinted sensor for voltammetric detection of norfloxacin}},
Journal = {{SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{219}},
Pages = {{301-307}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In this work, a norfloxacin selective modified glassy carbon electrode
   (GCE) based on a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) as electrochemical
   sensor was developed. A suspension of multi-walled carbon nanotubes
   (MWCNTs) was deposited on the electrode surface. Subsequently, a
   molecularly imprinted film was prepared by electropolymerization, via
   cyclic voltammetry of pyrrole (PPy) in the presence of norfloxacin (NFX)
   as the template molecule. A control electrode (NIP) was also prepared.
   Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and cyclic voltammetry in a
   ferrocyanide solution were performed for morphological and
   electrochemical characterisation, respectively. Several experimental
   parameters were studied and optimised. For quantification purposes the
   MIP/MWCNT/GCE was immersed in NFX solutions for 10 min, and the
   detection was performed in voltammetric cell by square wave voltammetry.
   The proposed sensor presented a linear behaviour, between peak current
   intensity and logarithmic concentration of NFX between 1 x 10(-7) and 8
   x 10(-6) M. The obtained results presented good precision, with a
   repeatability of 4.3\% and reproducibility of 9\% and the detection

Abstract = {{Dental composites cured at high temperatures show improved properties
   and higher degrees of conversion; however, there is no information
   available about the effect of pre-heating on material degradation.
   Objectives: This study evaluated the effect of pre-heating on the
   degradation of composites, based on the analysis of radiopacity and
   silver penetration using scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive
   X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS). Material and Methods: Thirty specimens
   were fabricated using a metallic matrix (2x8 mm) and the composites
   Durafill VS (Heraeus Kulzer),Z-250(3M/ESPE), and Z-350 (3M/ESPE), cured
   at 25 degrees C (no pre-heating) or 60 degrees C (pre-heating).
   Specimens were stored sequentially in the following solutions: 1) water
   for 7 days (60 degrees C), plus 0.1 N sodium hydroxide (NaOH) for 14
   days (60 degrees C); 2) 50\% silver nitrate (AgNO3) for 10 days (60
   degrees C). Specimens were radiographed at baseline and after each
   storage time, and the images were evaluated in gray scale. After the
   storage protocol, samples were analyzed using SEM/EDS to check the depth
   of silver penetration. Radiopacity and silver penetration data were
   analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey's tests (alpha=5\%). Results: Radiopacity
   levels were as follows: Durafill VS<Z-350<Z-250 (p<0.05). The depth of
   silver penetration into the composites ranked as follows: Durafill
   VS>Z-350>Z-250 (p<0.05). After storage in water/NaOH, pre-heated
   specimens presented higher radiopacity values than non-pre-heated
   specimens (p<0.05). There was a lower penetration of silver in
   pre-heated specimens (p<0.05). Conclusions: Pre-heating at 60 degrees C
   mitigated the degradation of composites based on analysis of radiopacity
   and silver penetration depth.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Acute fertility preservation for women is an
   interdisciplinary treatment that requires adequate information provision
   and early referral. This quality management project aimed to improve
   fertility preservation care by using a practical tool: Strengths,
   Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis.
   Study design: Quality management project was executed between May 2011
   and July 2013. This project has been executed in a university affiliated
   IVF-clinic in cooperation with two oncological sites and used a
   four-step strategy: (1) monitoring baseline referral process, (2)
   exploring baseline fertility preservation program by Strengths,
   Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats' (SWOT)-analysis, (3) setting up a
   new fertility preservation program and (4) evaluating the new fertility
   preservation program by means of SWOT-analysis.
   Results: During the three-months monitoring period, fertility
   preservation was requested for a total of 126 women. The mean age of the
   women was 33.8 years old (range 1-42 years old). Most requests came from
   women who wanted to cryopreserve oocytes because of age-related decline
   of fertility (n = 90; 71\%). Most requests for acute fertility
   preservation concerned women with breast cancer (n = 16; 57\%).
   Information leaflets and pre-consultation questionnaires for women
   improved the quality of first fertility preservation consultation as
   evaluated by final SWOT-analysis. Collaboration with oncological centres
   and information about fertility preservation improved the referral
   process.
   Conclusions: SWOT-analysis proved useful for setting up a new fertility
   preservation-program and can be recommended as a tool to improve the
   management and organisation of new types of reproductive care. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Inductive power transfer (IPT) and capacitive power transfer (CPT) are
   the two most pervasive methods of wireless power transfer (WPT). IPT is
   the most common and is applicable to many power levels and gap
   distances. Conversely, CPT is only applicable for power transfer
   applications with inherently small gap distances due to constraints on
   the developed voltage. Despite limitations on gap distance, CPT has been
   shown to be viable in kilowatt power level applications. This paper
   provides a critical comparison of IPT and CPT for small gap
   applications, wherein the theoretical and empirical limitations of each
   approach are established. A survey of empirical WPT data across diverse
   applications in the last decade using IPT and CPT technology graphically
   compares the two approaches in power level, gap distance, operational
   frequency, and efficiency, among other aspects. The coupler volumetric
   power density constrained to small gap sizes is analytically established
   through theoretical physical limitations of IPT and CPT. Finally,
   guidelines for selecting IPT or CPT in small gap systems are presented.}},

Abstract = {{In situ measurement of water spectrum is the basis of the validation of
   the ocean color remote sensing. The traditional method to obtain the
   water spectrum is based on the shipboard measurement at limited
   stations, which is difficult to meet the requirement of validation of
   ocean color remote sensing in the highly dynamic coastal waters. To
   overcome this shortage, continuously observing systems of water spectrum
   have been developed in the world. However, so far, there are still few
   high-frequency observation systems of the water spectrum in coastal
   waters, especially in the highly turbid and high-dynamic waters. Here,
   we established a high-frequency water-spectrum observing system based on
   tower in the Hangzhou Bay. The system measures the water spectrum at a
   step of 3 minutes, which can fully match the satellite observation. In
   this paper, we primarily developed a data processing method for the
   tower-based high-frequency water spectrum data, to realize automatic
   judgment of clear sky, sun glint, platform shadow, and weak
   illumination, etc., and verified the processing results. The results
   show that the normalized water-leaving radiance spectra obtained through
   tower observation have relatively high consistency with the shipboard
   measurement results, with correlation coefficient of more than 0.99, and
   average relative error of 9.96\%. In addition, the long-term observation
   capability of the tower-based high-frequency water-spectrum observing
   system was evaluated, and the results show that although the system has
   run for one year, the normalized water-leaving radiance obtained by this
   system have good consistency with the synchronously measurement by
   Portable spectrometer ASD in respect of spectral shape and value, with
   correlation coefficient of more than 0.90 and average relative error of
   6.48\%. Moreover, the water spectra from high-frequency observation by
   the system can be used to effectively monitor the rapid dynamic
   variation in concentration of suspended materials with tide. The
   tower-based high-frequency water-spectrum observing system provided rich
   in situ spectral data for the validation of ocean color remote sensing
   in turbid waters, especially for validation of the high
   temporal-resolution geostationary satellite ocean color remote sensing.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes generalized context modeling (GCM) for heterogeneous
   data compression. The proposed model extends the suffix of predicted
   subsequences in classic context modeling to arbitrary combinations of
   symbols in multiple directions. To address the selection of contexts,
   GCM constructs a model graph with a combinatorial structuring of finite
   order combination of predicted symbols as its nodes. The estimated
   probability for prediction is obtained by weighting over a class of
   context models that contain all the occurrences of nodes in the model
   graph. Moreover, separable context modeling in each direction is adopted
   for efficient prediction. To find optimal class of context models for
   prediction, the normalized maximum likelihood (NML) function is
   developed to estimate their structures and parameters, especially for
   heterogeneous data with large sizes. Furthermore, it is refined by
   context pruning to exclude the redundant models. Such model selection is
   optimal in the sense of minimum description length (MDL) principle,
   whose divergence is proven to be consistent with the actual
   distribution. It is shown that upper bounds of model redundancy for GCM
   are irrelevant to the size of data. GCM is validated in an extensive
   field of applications, e.g., Calgary corpus, executable files, and
   genomic data. Experimental results show that it outperforms most
   state-of-the-art context modeling algorithms reported.}},

Abstract = {{Electrical conductivity is a fundamental characteristic describing how
   strongly a network opposes flow of electrical current. In fully
   water-saturated porous media the conductivity, represented by the
   formation factor, is mainly controlled by porosity, connectivity of the
   conducting phases, and the tortuosity of electrical current paths.
   Previous work has shown that universal scaling derived from percolation
   and effective medium theories accurately describes the relationship
   between formation factor and porosity when the percolation threshold is
   taken account, as well as the porosity value at which the scaling
   switches from percolation theory to effective medium theory. We
   determined the formation factor in clay-rich sediments based on cation
   exchange capacity measurements on samples from five scientific ocean
   drilling sites in the Nankai Trough. We then compared the results to
   predictions from universal scaling after determining the volume of
   clay-bound water and the percolation threshold. We found that the
   previously reported universal scaling relations hold in these clay-rich
   sediments once the corrections are made for the clay-bound water and
   that percolation scaling appears to be valid over the entire range of
   observed porosities, probably due to relatively broad pore size
   distributions or low pore system connectivity. Our results show that
   universal scaling can be applied to describe the porosity dependence of
   the formation factor in clay-rich sediments when appropriate corrections
   are made for the presence of clay-bound water.}},

Abstract = {{Integrated medical curricular changes are altering the historical
   regional anatomy approach to abdominal dissection. The renal system is
   linked physiologically and biochemically to the cardiovascular and
   respiratory systems; yet, anatomists often approach the urinary system
   as part of the abdomen and pelvic regions. As part of an integrated
   curriculum, the renal system must be covered relatively quickly after
   the thorax in the cadaver laboratory, often without the opportunity to
   fully appreciate the rest of the abdominal contents. This article
   provides dissection instructions that follow one of the historical
   surgical approaches for nephrectomy, including preservation of the
   posterior abdominal wall neurovasclature. Dissection procedures were
   developed for first-year medical students, intending this posterior
   approach to the kidneys to be their first introduction to the renal
   system. It has been successfully implemented with the first-year medical
   students at the University of New England, College of Osteopathic
   Medicine. Utilizing this posterior approach to the kidney enabled the
   study of the anatomy of the kidneys, suprarenal glands, and renal
   vessels, as well as the muscles of the lumbar spine, while maintaining
   the integrity of the anterior abdominal wall and peritoneal cavity for
   future gastrointestinal and reproductive system-based dissections. Anat

Abstract = {{The present work deals with the micro macro analysis of shape memory
   alloy (SMA) fiber-reinforced Epoxy/Aluminum matrix composite cylinders
   under combined thermo-mechanical loadings. A robust phenomenological
   constitutive model is implemented to simulate martensite transformation,
   reorientation of martensite variants, pseudo-elasticity and shape memory
   effects of SMAs. Epoxy is assumed to behave as a linearly elastic
   material while Aluminum is considered to behave as an elastic plastic
   material with linear kinematic hardening. A representative volume
   element (RVE) consisting of SMA fibers surrounded with Epoxy/Aluminum
   matrix is simulated to determine the overall constitutive response of
   the composite in the generalized plane-strain state. Deformations of the
   RVE and macro composite cylinder are described based on the small strain
   and large displacement regimes. Finite element solutions coupled with an
   iterative elastic-predictor inelastic-corrector procedure are developed
   to analyze the RVE and macro composite cylinder. In particular, the
   micro-mechanical solution is implemented to evaluate the constitutive
   behavior of structural elements made of SMA composite at each iteration
   of each load step. Parametric studies are performed to examine the
   effects of pre-strain, SMA fiber volume fraction, fiber orientation,
   stacking sequence and loading order on the macro-thermo-mechanical
   responses of long composite cylinders subjected to internal pressure,
   axial, torsional and thermal loadings. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{22}},

Pages = {{917-922}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Recombinant vectors based on adeno-associated virus (AAV) are proving to
   be powerful tools for genetic manipulation of the liver, for both
   discovery and therapeutic purposes. The system can be used to deliver
   transgene cassettes for expression or, alternatively, DNA templates for
   genome editing via homologous recombination. The replicative state of
   target cells is known to influence the efficiency of these processes and
   knowledge of the host-vector interactions involved is required for
   optimally effective vector deployment. Here we show, for the first time
   in vivo, that in addition to the known effects of hepatocellular
   replication on AAV-mediated gene transfer, the vector itself exerts a
   potent, albeit transient suppressive effect on cell cycle progression
   that is relieved on a time course that correlates with the known rate of
   clearance of input single-stranded vector DNA. This finding requires
   further mechanistic investigation, delineates an excellent model system
   for such studies and further deepens our insight into the complexity of
   interactions between AAV vectors and the cell cycle in a clinically
   promising target tissue.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction > Venous thromboembolism is a common complication in cancer
   and is the second cause of death below infection. Low molecular weight
   heparin is the gold standard in venous thromboembolism during cancer.
   This work aimed to evaluate the prevalence of prescription of low
   molecular weight heparin used at curative dose and the compliance of our
   practices with the recommendations. Methods > A retrospective study was
   led over a 3- month period, on adult patients suffering from venous
   thromboembolism who had received low molecular weight heparin at
   curative dose.
   Results > A 4\% prevalence of prescription of low molecular weight
   heparin at curative doses has been reported. The results showed an
   incidental discovery of venous thromboembolism on routine restaging
   scans in 64\% cases. The most found indication was the treatment of deep
   vein thrombosis (51\% cases). According to the dosage, overall
   compliance of prescription is estimated at 55\%.
   Discussion > The incidental discovery rate (64\%) is consistent with the
   literature that confirms the high incidence of asymptomatic thrombosis.
   The rate of non- compliant prescriptions could result from a lack of re-
   evaluation and adjustment of dosages. These results confirm the need to
   educate practitioners in diagnosing and managing venous thromboembolism.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we have assessed the role of changing physicochemical
   parameters and substrate types on the production of alpha-amylase enzyme
   from Penicillium chrysogenum, with a view to determining the optimal
   conditions required for its maximum production. The findings of this
   research revealed that, at pH 6 using linseed oil cake as substratum,
   alpha-amylase enzyme production was maximum (550.0 U/mL), when the fungi
   was incubated for 6 days at 30 degrees C in 0.1 M acetate buffer.
   Further, reasonably good production of the alpha-amylase enzyme was also
   observed at pH 9 with all the experimented carbon sources as substrates.
   Moreover, statistical analysis, using analysis of variance (ANOVA)
   carried out to study the impact of different studied parameters on the
   alpha-amylase enzyme production revealed that incubation period of 6-18
   days is highly significant (p = 0.01) factor in amylotic activity of the
   P. chrysogenum. Under the researched out optimal conditions, P.
   chrysogenum is an economically viable option for the industrial and
   biotechnological production of alpha-amylase enzyme. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   variation in parasitism is host sex. Such variation could be caused by
   the immunomodulatory effects of gonadal steroids. Here we assess the
   influence of gonadal steroids on the ability of guppies (Poecilia
   reticulata) to defend themselves against a common and deleterious
   parasite (Gyrodactylus turnbulli). Adult male guppies underwent 31 days
   of artificial demasculinization with the androgen receptor-antagonist
   flutamide, or feminization with a combination of flutamide and the
   synthetic oestrogen 17 -estradiol, and their parasite loads were
   compared over time to untreated males and females. Both demasculinized
   and feminized male guppies had lower G. turnbulli loads than the
   untreated males and females, but this effect appeared to be mainly the
   result of demasculinization, with feminization having no additional
   measurable effect. Furthermore, demasculinized males, feminized males
   and untreated females all suffered lower Gyrodactylus-induced mortality
   than untreated males. Together, these results suggest that androgens
   reduce the ability of guppies to control parasite loads, and modulate
   resistance to and survival from infection. We discuss the relevance of
   these findings for understanding constraints on the evolution of
   resistance in guppies and other vertebrates.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUNDBiomass from rubber wood has been gaining interest due to its
   availability and relative economic value. However it is difficult to
   separate the biomass using common solvents due to its complicated
   structure. The recent application of ionic liquids as reaction solvents
   has offered a new platform for its efficient utilization. The
   dissolution of biomass in ionic liquid via microwave has been
   investigated to reduce the dissolution time.
   RESULTSThe pretreatment involves dissolving the biomass in various ionic
   liquids under domestic microwave radiation. The dissolution rate is
   dependent on the type of ionic liquid and biomass was found to be easily
   dissolved in acetate based imidazolium ionic liquid. The highest (up to
   85\%) substantial dissolution of rubber biomass was reached in
   1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate {[}C(2)mim]{[}OAc] and
   1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate {[}C(4)mim]{[}OAc]. Furthermore, the
   amount of glucose resulting from pretreatment with {[}C(2)mim] {[}OAc]
   and {[}C(4)mim]{[}OAc] was also higher than that from pretreatment with
   cloride anion. This is due to changes in physico chemical properties
   such as decreasing crystallinity in biomass as confirmed by XRD, TGA and
   FTIR analyses.
   CONCLUSIONAnion acetate based imidazolium ionic liquid was discovered to
   be a good solvent for the dissolution of rubber biomass under microwave
   irradiation for converting cellulose to glucose. (c) 2014 Society of

Abstract = {{The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is currently
   negotiating with its six trading partners to form a new trade agreement
   called the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). The RCEP
   intends to harmonise rules and regulations across multiple overlapping
   free trade agreements in the region, and thereby attract new members.
   However, it faces several challenges. The mention of a flexibility
   principle and the ASEAN Way' of decision-making has led many to believe
   that the RCEP will be yet another low-quality regional trade agreement.
   However, the RCEP presents all ASEAN members with the opportunity to
   take a role in setting the agenda for a region-wide agreement. Hence,
   despite its challenges, ASEAN must make the effort to reach an
   attractive RCEP vis-a-vis other competing regional agreements.
   Accordingly, this paper describes what the RCEP is intended to be, how
   it emerged, and the issues that might affect the agreement's final
   quality, in order to evaluate if it will establish a new paradigm or a
   repackaged version of ASEAN's existing trade agreements.}},

Title = {{Biography and Homoeopathy in Bengal: Colonial lives of a European

Journal = {{MODERN ASIAN STUDIES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1732-1771}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Despite being recognized as a significant literary mode in understanding
   the advent of the modern self, biographies as a genre have received
   relatively little attention from South Asian historians. Likewise,
   histories of science and healing in British India have largely ignored
   the colonial trajectories of those sectarian, dissenting, supposedly
   pseudo-sciences and medical heterodoxies that have flourished in Europe
   since the late eighteenth century. This article addresses these gaps in
   the historiography to identify biographies as a principal mode through
   which an incipient, `heterodox'Western science like homoeopathy could
   consolidate and sustain itself in Bengal. In recovering the cultural
   history of a category that the state archives render largely invisible,
   this article argues that biographies are more than a mere repository of
   individual lives, and in fact are a veritable site of power. In bringing
   histories of print and publishing, histories of medicine, and histories
   of life writing practices together, it pursues two broad themes: first,
   it analyses the sociocultural strategies and networks by which
   scientific doctrines and concepts are translated across cultural
   borders. It explores the relation between medical commerce, print
   capital, and therapeutic knowledge to illustrate that acculturation of
   medical science necessarily drew upon and reinforced local
   constellations of class, kinship, and religion. Second, it
   simultaneously reflects upon the expanding genre of homoeopathic
   biographies published since the mid-nineteenth century: on their
   features, relevance, and functions, examining in particular the
   contemporary status of biography vis-a-vis `history' in writing
   objective pasts.}},

   Urban Australian Children in the First 12 Months of Life}},
Journal = {{MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{11}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{To describe the relationship between maternal education and child health
   outcomes at 12 months of age in a cohort of children in urban Australia,
   and to determine whether this relationship could be explained by the
   intermediate factors of maternal health behaviour and the social
   environmental context.
   Data were derived from The Environments for Health Living Griffith Birth
   Cohort Study. Women attending their third trimester antenatal
   appointment at one of three public hospitals were recruited between 2006
   and 2010 and invited to complete a 48-item, baseline self-administered
   questionnaire. Twelve months following the birth of their baby, a
   follow-up questionnaire consisting of 63 items was distributed.
   Women for whom complete follow-up data were not available were different
   from women who did complete follow-up data. The children of women with
   follow-up data-whom at the time of their pregnancy had not completed
   school or whose highest level of education was secondary school or a
   trade-had respectively a 59 and 57 \% increased chance of having had a
   respiratory/infectious disease or injury in the first year of life
   (according to parent proxy-reports), compared to children of women with
   a tertiary education. When maternal behavioural and social environmental
   factors during pregnancy were included in the model (n=1914), the effect
   of secondary education was still evident but with a reduced odds ratio
   of 1.35 (95 \% CI 1.07-1.72) and 1.19 (95 \% CI 0.87-1.64),
   respectively. The effect of not having completed school was no longer
   significant.
   Results indicate that the relationship between maternal education and
   child outcomes may be mediated by maternal social environmental and
   behavioural factors. Results are likely an underestimation of the effect
   size, given the under representation in our cohort of participants with
   maternal characteristics associated with elevated risk of infant
   morbidity.}},

Abstract = {{The long power production warranties guaranteed by the manufacturers of
   photovoltaic (PV) modules (25 years) are a vital factor for the
   economical viability of PV systems. Nevertheless, recent studies have
   demonstrated that the modules may experience an early degradation, which
   turns into the reduction of the power production or even the damage of
   the entire PV module. In this paper, a method aimed at detecting the
   module degradation is introduced. It detects and quantifies the
   degradation by means of two indicators, which are aimed at estimating
   the increment of the modules series resistance, this parameter being one
   of the most affected by some degradation mechanisms. The increase of the
   series resistance value is estimated through the evaluation of the error
   in predicting the position of the maximum power point, which is obtained
   by comparing the experimental measurements with the single-diode model.
   The proposed method is experimentally validated, and it is compared with
   other methods reported in the literature. The results show that the
   proposed indicators are able to accurately estimate the increments of
   the series resistance with a low sensitivity to the irradiance and
   temperature values. This feature improves the accuracy and the
   reliability of the diagnosis processes and monitoring systems.}},

Abstract = {{Peroxyl radical sensitive fluorescent dye (BODIPY 665/676) encapsulated
   nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) were prepared by blending solid
   (eicosane) and liquid (glyceryl trioctanoate) lipid in various
   proportions (10:90, 30:70, 50:50, 100:0 liquid: solid). Peroxyl radical
   transport rate was measured by adding 20 mmol/1
   2,2'-azobis-2-methyl-propanimidamide, dihydrochloride in the aqueous
   phase. Fluorescence imaging of NLCs revealed that fluorescent dye was
   distributed in the liquid lipid regions of 10 and 30\% NLCs. However,
   50\% NLC resembled NLCs with 100\% liquid lipid in that, little or no
   solid domains were observed and the dye was more or less uniformly
   distributed. Peroxyl radical transport was in the order, 100\% < 50\% <
   30\% < 10\% NLCs. More uniform distribution of the encapsulant possibly
   reduced the effective peroxyl radical transport rate, particularly when
   solid domains were present in the core of NLCs. Thus, 100\% liquid lipid
   emulsions may be better than NLCs in improving the oxidative stability
   of the encapsulant. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Menopause timing has a substantial impact on infertility and risk of
   disease, including breast cancer, but the underlying mechanisms are
   poorly understood. We report a dual strategy in similar to 70,000 women
   to identify common and low-frequency protein-coding variation associated
   with age at natural menopause (ANM). We identified 44 regions with
   common variants, including two regions harboring additional rare
   missense alleles of large effect. We found enrichment of signals in or
   near genes involved in delayed puberty, highlighting the first molecular
   links between the onset and end of reproductive lifespan. Pathway
   analyses identified major association with DNA damage response (DDR)
   genes, including the first common coding variant in BRCA1 associated
   with any complex trait. Mendelian randomization analyses supported a
   causal effect of later ANM on breast cancer risk (similar to 6\%
   increase in risk per year; P = 3 x 10(-14)), likely mediated by
   prolonged sex hormone exposure rather than DDR mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Function point analysis (FPA) is a standardized method to systematically
   measure the functional size of software. This method is proposed by an
   international organization and it is currently recommended by
   governments and organizations as a standard method to be adopted for
   this type of measurement. This paper presents a compilation of
   improvements, focused on increasing the accuracy of the FPA method,
   which have been proposed over the past 13 years. The methodology used
   was a systematic literature review (SLR), which was conducted with four
   research questions aligned with the objectives of this study. As a
   result of the SLR, of the 1600 results returned by the search engines,
   454 primary studies were preselected according to the criteria
   established for the SLR. Among these studies, only 18 specifically
   referred to accuracy improvements for FPA, which was the goal of this
   study. The low number of studies that propose FPA improvements might
   demonstrate the maturity of the method in the current scenario of
   software metrics. Specifically in terms of found issues, it was found
   that the step for calculating the functional size exhibited the highest
   number of problems, indicating the need to revise FPA in order to
   encompass the possible improvements suggested by the researchers.}},

Abstract = {{This study attempted to compare the sanitary regulations for food
   services in the Southern Region of the country, with Federal Technical
   Regulations. The study used a descriptive and exploratory approach with
   data collected between March and July 2010 and updated in August 2015.
   Interviews with those responsible for the food sector in the Health
   Surveillance Agency were recorded, transcribed, and approved for use.
   The interviews aided analysis and comparison of the different health
   regulations. The most similar regulation came from Rio Grande do Sul
   Secretary of Health, which established a specific regulation for the
   responsibilities and training of food handlers. Another similar
   regulation was the Ordinance design, which used a structured checklist
   and compliance percentage. In contrast, Santa Catarina State's
   resolution, despite its checklist design, presents fewer similarities.
   The Health Surveillance Agency of the state of Parana had no
   complementary laws, published a specific Technical Note for street food.}},

Abstract = {{Good governance codes usually end with a list of public values no one
   could oppose. A recurrent issue is that not all of these valueshowever

   performance and procedural values of governance, this article zooms in
   on the conflict between two different types of values, signifying and
   exemplifying how output and outcome on one hand and the process of
   governance on the other may coincide or collide. The main research
   question is, What is the nature of value conflict in public governance
   and what specific conflicts between performance and procedural values do
   public actors perceive? A literature review and two case studies
   involving aldermen and the most senior public administrators in public
   governance set out to answer these questions. The most frequently
   perceived conflict is between lawfulness and transparency in procedure,
   on one hand, and the attainment of effectiveness and efficiency as
   performance values on the other.}},

Abstract = {{Research on associations between medication use during pregnancy and
   congenital anomalies is significative for assessing the safe use of a
   medicine in pregnancy. Congenital anomaly (CA) registries do not have
   optimal information on medicine exposure, in contrast to prescription
   databases. Linkage of prescription databases to the CA registries is a
   potentially effective method of obtaining accurate information on
   medicine use in pregnancies and the risk of congenital anomalies.
   We linked data from primary care and prescription databases to five
   European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies (EUROCAT) CA registries.
   The linkage was evaluated by looking at linkage rate, characteristics of
   linked and non-linked cases, first trimester exposure rates for six
   groups of medicines according to the prescription data and information
   on medication use registered in the CA databases, and agreement of
   exposure.
   Of the 52,619 cases registered in the CA databases, 26,552 could be
   linked. The linkage rate varied between registries over time and by type
   of birth. The first trimester exposure rates and the agreements between
   the databases varied for the different medicine groups. Information on
   anti-epileptic drugs and insulins and analogue medicine use recorded by
   CA registries was of good quality. For selective serotonin reuptake
   inhibitors, anti-asthmatics, antibacterials for systemic use, and
   gonadotropins and other ovulation stimulants, the recorded information
   was less complete.
   Linkage of primary care or prescription databases to CA registries
   improved the quality of information on maternal use of medicines in
   pregnancy, especially for medicine groups that are less fully registered
   in CA registries.}},

Abstract = {{The efficient use of saline water depends on the tolerance of crop and
   technology adoption to reduce the effect of salinity. The present study
   was conducted with the objective to evaluate the use of the growth
   promoter Stimulate(center dot) on cowpea plants under saline conditions.
   The experimental design was completely randomized, in a 4 x 4
   arrangement, composed of four levels of salinity of irrigation water
   (0.5, 2.0, 3.5 and 5.0 dS m(-1)) and four levels of Stimulate(center
   dot) (0, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 L ha(-1)), with four replications. The
   following variables were analysed: number of pods plant(-1), pod length,
   number of grains pod(-1), grain yield and harvest index. Statistical
   analysis of the data revealed that there was significant interaction
   between the factors for most variables. The use of high concentrations
   of growth promoter enhances the deleterious effects of salinity, as well
   as the use of irrigation water of high salinity inhibits the beneficial
   effect of plant growth regulator in crop yield. The use of biostimulant
   Stimulate(center dot) with concentrations of 0.5 to 0.75 L ha(-1)
   provides an increase in grain yield of cowpea, provided that irrigation
   is performed with water of electrical conductivity less than 3.5 dS
   m(-1).}},

Abstract = {{The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of gymnastic training (GYM)
   and dynamic mobilization exercises (DMEs) on stride length (SL) and
   epaxial muscle size in therapy horses. Nine cross-bred hippotherapy
   horses that performed three, 25-minute therapeutic riding sessions per
   week throughout the study period were randomly assigned to three
   experimental groups: a control group in which the horses were sedentary
   with no additional physical activity; a group that performed DMEs; and a
   group that performed both DMEs and additional GYM including pelvic
   tilting, backing, turning in small circles, and walking over a raised
   rail to strengthen the abdominal and pelvic stabilizer muscles. The
   exercises were performed 3 days per week for 3 months, with evaluations
   at the start and end of the study. Stride quality was assessed by
   measuring SL and tracking distance (TD). Epaxial muscle size was
   monitored by ultrasonographic measurement of m. longissimus dorsi (LD)
   thickness and m. multifidi (MM) cross-sectional area. Paired t tests
   were used to compare within groups across time, and between groups were
   detected using analysis of variance with Tukey post hoc test. When
   walking at 1.3 m/s, SL and TD at walk increased significantly (P < .05)
   in horses subjected to GYM. Thickness of LD did not change in any group,
   but cross-sectional area of MM increased significantly by 3.55 cm(2)
   (DME) and 3.78 cm(2) (GYM). It was concluded that GYM training improved
   stride quality and DME-stimulated MM hypertrophy which has been shown to
   improve intervertebral joint stability in other species. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This study presents the development and validation of a method for the
   determination of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) in potato
   slurry samples using graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry
   (GFAAS) after multivariate optimization. The slurries were prepared by
   cryogenic grinding, sieving, and addition of 2\% (v/v) nitric acid and
   1\% (v/v) hydrogenous peroxide up to a 2-mL volume. The slurries were
   kept homogeneous using air bubbling with an aquarium pump. Iridium (500
   mu g) and titanium were the best permanent modifiers for As, Cd, and Pb.
   Factorial design was used to obtain the best modifiers, pyrolysis and
   atomization temperatures for all analytes. After that a central
   composition design (CCD) was made, to obtain the best pyrolysis and
   atomization temperatures.
   The accuracy was evaluated by recovery tests over three different days
   (n=21) and the results varied from 97.4 to 102.8\% for As, 102.3 to
   105.2\% for Pb, and 100.0 to 104.5\% for Cd. The limits of detection and
   quantification were 0.08 and 0.26 mu g g(-1) for As, 3.77 and 12.6 ng
   g(-1) for Cd, and 0.07 and 0.22 ng g(-1) for Pb, respectively. For
   comparison, a certified reference material (NIST 1568a Rice Flour) was
   analyzed resulting in a value of 0.28 +/- 0.06 mu g g(-1) for As
   (certified value of 0.29 +/- 0.03 mu g g(-1)) and 0.023 +/- 0.001 mu g
   g(-1) for Cd (certified value of 0.022 +/- 0.001 mu g g(-1)). The method
   offers a simple sample preparation, resulting in adequate accuracy and
   precision, good sample output, and is very suitable for the quick and
   cost-effective analysis of potato samples.}},

   specimens of yellowtail tetra showing slow swimming, respiratory
   difficulty, scaleness and darkened skin were examined. Fish were
   analysed in situ for ectoparasites diagnosis. Fragments of the gill
   arches were removed and processed according to usual histopathology. The
   gills showed focal and multifocal paleness and whitish areas besides the
   congestion and hemorrhage signs on the gill filaments. Several white
   spots attached to the gill filament apex with slight movement were
   identified as the ergasilid crustacean. Histopathologic alanalysis
   revealed the gill and blood vessels compression. It was also observed
   proliferative alterations close to gill filament apex, hyperplasia,
   total fusion and subepithelial oedema of the secondary lamellae,
   proliferation of the mucus cells, and inflammatory infiltrate by
   eosinophilic granular cells surrounding the parasite attachment region.

Title = {{Analytical solution for oil displacement by polymer slugs containing
   salt in porous media}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{135}},
Pages = {{323-335}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The displacement of oil by water containing dissolved chemical products
   in porous media is one of the most used Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR)
   techniques. The continuous injection of these displacing fluids is very
   expensive; the alternative is the injection of finite volumes (slugs).
   Chemical methods of EOR involve mass transfer through adsorption and
   also changes transport properties. Mathematical modeling and
   experimental tests are important for the development of a project to
   increase oil recovery by EOR methods. This paper presents the analytical
   solution for the injection of a water slug containing dissolved polymer
   and salt followed by water drive. In this model the salt does not adsorb
   nor modifies the water fractional flow curve, but changes the adsorption
   isotherm. The solution is obtained by introducing a potential function
   based on the conservation of the aqueous phase volume which splits the
   original system into a thermodynamics auxiliary system and a transport
   equation. The thermodynamics auxiliary system depends only on the
   adsorption isotherm and allows predicting the distribution of components
   between the different phases. The transport equation, also called
   lifting equation, is a function of the relative permeabilities and
   viscosities of the phases. The solution of this problem is not
   self-similar, like the continuous injection of dissolved chemical
   components in water, and interactions among waves occur. A sensitivity
   analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of some parameters in the
   efficiency of the technique. The solution allows determining the slug
   behavior, and shows the development of the chromatographic cycle in
   porous media, illustrating the appearance and disappearance of the
   components injected into the reservoir rock. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Economic evaluation of stuttering treatment in preschool children: The
   RESTART-study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{106-118}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incremental
   cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of the Lidcombe Program (LP)
   compared with treatment based on the Demands and Capacities Model
   (RESTART-DCM) for preschool children who stutter.
   Method: A cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis were carried out
   alongside a Randomized Clinical Trial (the RESTART-study). In total, 199
   children in 20 speech clinics participated. Outcome measures included
   the number needed to treat, based on the percentage of children who did
   not stutter at 18 months, and Health-related Quality of Life (EQ-VAS and
   HUI3) at 3, 6, 12 and 18 months. Health-related Quality of Life scores
   were used to calculate quality adjusted life years (V-QALYs for the
   EQ-VAS and U-QALYs for the HUI3). Direct and indirect costs were
   measured by cost questionnaires. Missing data were multiply imputed.
   Percentages of children who did not stutter in both groups were compared
   by a chi-square test. Between-group differences in mean QALYs and costs,
   as well as cost effectiveness and cost-utility ratios, were evaluated by
   applying bootstrapping techniques.
   Results: After 18 months, health outcomes were slightly better in the LP
   group, although only the difference in V-QALYs was statistical
   significant (0.018; 95\% CI: 0.008 to 0.027) with a small effect size
   (Cohen's d = 0.17). Mean costs for the LP group were significantly
   higher compared to the RESTART-DCM group ((sic)3199 versus (sic)3032),
   again with a small effect size (Cohen's d = 0.14). The incremental
   cost-effectiveness ratio was (sic)3360 for one additional child who did
   not stutter with the LP, and the estimated cost-utility ratios were
   (sic)10,413 (extra cost per extra V-QALY) and (sic)18,617 (extra cost
   per extra U-QALY). The results indicated a high probability that the LP
   is cost-effective compared to RESTART-DCM treatment given a threshold
   for willingness-to-pay of (sic)20,000 per QALY.
   Conclusions: Differences in effects and costs between the LP and
   RESTART-DCM treatment were small. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility
   ratios were in favor of the LP. The LP is considered a good alternative
   to RESTART-DCM treatment in Dutch primary care. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Breeding programs strive to obtain cultivars with superior traits. The
   association between these characters, such as those estimated by
   correlation coeficients, are important to the breeding selection
   process. In this study we analyzed phenotypic and genotypic correlations
   between yield and other agronomic traits in soybean progenies derived
   from various crosses to support breeding line selection in the soybean
   breading program of the Federal University of Uberlandia (UFU). The
   experiment was carried out in the 2011/2012 growing season at the Capim
   Branco research station in Uberlandia, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Seventy-one
   soybean lines were evaluated using a randomized complete block design
   with three replications. In these plots plants were evaluated for the
   number of pods, grain yield per plant, number of days for flowering,
   plant height at flowering, number of days for maturity, plant height at
   maturity, height of the first pod insertion, number of grains per pod
   and grain yield per plant. The estimates for genotypic correlations were
   equal or greater than those for the phenotypic correlations for all the
   evaluated traits. This suggests a small effect of environmental factors
   on the trait expression. An exception of this behavior was the
   correlation between plant height at flowering and plant height at
   maturity. In this case, although the signs for the genotypic and
   phenotypic correlations were the same, the value for the last was
   greater than that for the former. The late flowering and late-maturing
   plants were taller. Also, selecting plants for higher number of pods
   ultimately contributed for the selection of plants with higher grain
   yield. The selection of late-flowering and late-maturing plants have
   yielded taller plantsin the same way that the selection for a higher pod
   number could promote the selection and improvement of grains yield
   trait.}},

Abstract = {{Urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) are
   the most prevalent bacterial STIs worldwide. Molecular tests are the
   standard for the detection of CT and NG, as these are difficult to
   culture. The recently introduced CE-IVD marked GMT Presto assay promises
   to be a valuable addition in CT and NC diagnostics. The advantage of the
   Presto assay is that it works on many PCR systems and the DNA can be
   isolated by any system. We compared the Presto assay to the widely used
   Roche cobas (R) 4800 CT/NC test for the detection of CT and NC in 612
   vaginal and rectal dry collected swabs. Discrepant samples were tested
   by the TIB MOLBIOL Lightmix Kit 480 HT CT/NC assay. The alloyed gold
   standard was defined as two concurring Presto and cobas (R) 4800
   results, or, with discrepant Presto and cobas (R) results, two
   concurring results of either test together with the Lightmix Kit 480 HT
   CT/NC assay. For the Presto assay, we observed 77 CT positive (13\%) and
   22 NC positive (3,6\%) vaginal samples, and 41 CT positive (6,7\%) and
   11 NC positive (1,8\%) rectal samples. For the cobas (R) 4800 assay, we
   observed 77 CT positive (13\%) and 21 NC positive (3,4\%) vaginal
   samples, and 39 CT positive (6,4\%) and 11 NC positive (1,8\%) rectal
   samples. Ten CT samples were discrepant between Presto and cobas (R)
   4800 CT/NC assays, while two NC samples were discrepant. CT sensitivity
   in both assays was 100\% compared to the alloyed gold standard. The
   sensitivity was 100\% for both vaginal and rectal dry swabs, underlining
   the suitability of these sample types for detection of CT and NC. The
   Presto assay is therefore valuable for molecular detection of CT and NC
   in dry vaginal and rectal swabs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN) override the drive to
   eat, forgoing immediate rewards in favor of longer-term goals. We
   examined delay discounting and its neural correlates in AN before and
   after treatment to test a potential mechanism of illness persistence.
   METHODS: Inpatients with AN (n = 59) and healthy control subjects (HC, n
   = 39) performed a delay discounting task at two time points. A subset (n
   - 30 AN, n - 22 HC) participated in functional magnetic resonance
   imaging scanning during the task. The task consisted of a range of
   monetary choices with variable delay times, yielding individual discount
   rates-the rate by which money loses value over time.
   RESULTS: Before treatment, the AN group showed a preference for delayed
   over earlier rewards (i.e., less steep discount rates) compared with HC;
   after weight restoration, AN did not differ from HC. Underweight AN
   showed slower response times for earlier versus delayed choices; this
   reversed with treatment. Underweight AN showed abnormal neural activity
   in striatum and dorsal anterior cingulate; normalization of behavior was
   associated with increased activation in reward regions (striatum and
   dorsal anterior cingulate) and decision-making regions (dorsolateral
   prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex).
   CONCLUSIONS: The undernourished state of AN may amplify the tendency to
   forgo immediate rewards in favor of longer-term goals. The results
   suggest that behavior that looks phenotypically like excessive
   self-control does not correspond with enhanced prefrontal recruitment.
   Rather, the results point to alterations in cingulostriatal circuitry
   that offer new insights on the potential role of abnormalities in
   decision-making neural systems in the perpetuation of AN.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To test the following associations: (1) complete obstruction
   on drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) and polysomnographic and
   subjective measures of obstructive sleep apnea; (2) tongue
   base/epiglottic obstruction and apnea index.
   Study Design Retrospective cohort.
   Setting Academic medical center.
   Subjects and Methods Subjects included surgically naive adult patients
   with DISE. Chart extraction included demographics, polysomnography, and
   Epworth Sleepiness Scale and SNORE25 (Symptoms of Nocturnal Obstruction
   and Related Events 25) scores. Each DISE video was examined for complete
   obstruction at velum, oropharynx, tongue, epiglottis (VOTE system).
   Student's t test, correlation, and multivariate linear regression were
   performed.
   Results Among 65 subjects, complete obstruction was observed at 0 (3\%),
   1 (46\%), 2 (48\%), and 3 (3\%) subsites, respectively. Subjects with
   0-1 subsites vs 2-4 subsites of complete obstruction had similar apnea
   indexes (13 24 vs 12 +/- 17, P = .78, 83\% power to detect difference of
   15), apnea-hypopnea indexes (30 +/- 25 vs 31 +/- 28, P = .96, 54\% power
   to detect difference of 15), Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores (11 +/- 7
   vs 12 +/- 5, P = .34, 91\% power to detect difference of 5), and SNORE25
   scores (2.0 +/- 1.1 vs 1.9 +/- 1.0, P = .70, 96\% power to detect
   difference of 1.0), with similar results after adjusting for age, sex,
   body mass index, and tonsil status. Neither tongue base nor epiglottic
   obstruction was associated with apnea index.
   Conclusion The number of subsites with complete obstruction on DISE was
   not associated with polysomnographic, subjective sleepiness, and
   quality-of-life measures. Tongue base and epiglottic obstruction were
   not associated with apnea index. Larger detailed analyses are needed to
   determine the importance of each site and degree of obstruction seen on
   DISE.}},

   characteristics of water, temperature, oxygen saturation, dissolved
   oxygen, electric conductivity and nutrients as well as flow velocity at
   sample site, were measured simultaneously with each sampling. Physical
   and chemical characteristics showed low temperature oscillations, good
   aeration and oligotrophic conditions. In general, greater diatom
   diversity was noted on natural substrate. A total of 104 diatom species
   were found on natural substrate and 82 on glass slides. The best
   represented genera on both types of substrate were Gomphonema and
   Navicula (each with eight species), Nitzschia (with six species), and
   Cocconeis (with five species). Achnanthidium exiguum, Achnanthidium

Abstract = {{Combined 17 alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency is a rare cause of
   congenital adrenal hyperplasia and hypogonadism. Hypertension and
   hypokalemia are essential presenting features. We report an Arab family
   with four affected XX siblings. The eldest presented with abdominal pain
   and was diagnosed with a retroperitoneal malignant mixed germ cell
   tumour. She was hypertensive and hypogonadal. One sibling presented with
   headache due to hypertension while the other two siblings were diagnosed
   with hypertension on a routine school check. A homozygous R96Q missense
   mutation in P450c17 was detected in the index case who had primary
   amenorrhea and lack of secondary sexual characters at 17 years. The
   middle two siblings were identical twins and had no secondary sexual
   characters at the age of 14. All siblings had hypokalemia, very low
   level of adrenal androgens, high ACTH and high levels of aldosterone
   substrates. Treatment was commenced with steroid replacement and puberty
   induction with estradiol. The index case had surgical tumor resection
   and chemotherapy. All siblings required antihypertensive treatment and
   the oldest remained on two antihypertensive medications 12 years after
   diagnosis. Her breast development remained poor despite adequate
   hormonal replacement. Combined 17a-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase deficiency is
   a rare condition but might be underdiagnosed. It should be considered in
   young patients presenting with hypertension, particularly if there is a
   family history of consanguinity and with more than one affected sibling.
   Antihypertensive medication might continue to be required despite
   adequate steroid replacement. Breast development may remain poor in
   mutations causing complete form of the disease.}},

Abstract = {{Thrust termination transient behavior of liquid-propellant rocket
   engines is important for launch vehicle to achieve the desired final
   velocity and, hence, fulfill the desired mission in placing a satellite
   in the intended orbit. A mathematical model has been developed for an
   open-cycle engine to predict the transient behavior of engine
   components, obtain the pressure changes of the combustion chamber, and
   to determine the cutoff impulse. By employing this model, the engine
   shutdown process has been simulated in four time intervals: (1) the
   duration from when cutoff command is issued to the time when the cutoff
   valves start to close, (2) closing of the cutoff valves, (3) discharge
   of combustion products from the chamber, and (4) the duration of the
   phase change and pressure fluctuations. The propellant flow has been
   modeled one-dimensionally in the cutoff valve and thermodynamically in
   the cooling channels and the combustion chamber. The results indicate
   that the time duration of the first two stages and the working pressure
   of the engine during the transmission of the cutoff command have
   considerable impacts on the increase or reduction of the thrust force.
   Also, with the improvement in modeling accuracy and the complete
   development of the engine processes, the results indicate a maximum
   error of 9\% compared with the 15-41\% error in the calculation of
   cutoff impulse achieved by previous works, which demonstrates the
   enhanced accuracy of the present modeling.}},

Abstract = {{In compressive sensing (CS), the restricted isometry property (RIP) is
   an important condition on measurement matrices which guarantees the
   recovery of sparse signals with undersampled measurements. It has been
   proved in the prior works that both random (e.g., i.i.d. Gaussian,
   Bernoulli,) and Toeplitz matrices satisfy the RIP with high probability.
   However, structured matrices, such as banded Toeplitz matrices have
   drawn more attention since their structures have the advantage of fast
   matrix multiplication which may decrease the computational complexity of
   recovery algorithms. In this paper, we show that banded block Toeplitz
   matrices satisfy the RIP condition with high probability. Banded block
   Toeplitz matrices can be used in the sparse multi-channel source
   separation. The banded block Toeplitz matrices decrease the
   computational complexity while they have fewer number of non-zero
   entries in comparison to the same dimensional banded Toeplitz matrices.
   Furthermore, our simulation results show that banded block Toeplitz
   matrices outperform banded Toeplitz matrices in signal estimation. The
   analytical RIP bound for banded block Toeplitz matrices is provided in
   this paper and the RIP bound of sparse Gaussian matrices is also
   obtained as an upper bound for banded block Toeplitz matrices. Our
   simulation and analytical results show that sparse Gaussian random
   matrices do satisfy the RIP condition with high probability. The
   probability of satisfying the RIP depends on the probability of zero
   entries.}},

Abstract = {{Differential received signal strength indicator (DRSSI), in which two
   separate received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements are used
   to localize an radio frequency (RF) source with unknown transmitted
   power, has been proposed to eliminate the need for estimating the
   strength of the transmitted signal in localization. In this paper, the
   problem of choosing the best pair of measurements, which can lead to
   close-to-minimum localization error based on Cramer-Rao lower bound
   (CRLB) analysis, is addressed. The analysis shows that the root mean
   squared error (RMSE) of localization decreases monotonically with the
   increase of the angle between two pairing measurements, with respect to
   the target, up to 180 deg. In other words, it is shown that the best
   pair of measurements consists of the measurement points which are inline
   with the target opposing each other. The second best pairing angle is
   near 135 deg with respect to the target. To practically show the
   importance of this analysis, several Monte Carlo simulation scenarios
   were conducted which show that the RMSE of localization would be
   close-to-minimum using the proposed analysis.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel decision making framework for optimal
   transmission switching satisfying the AC feasibility, stability and
   circuit breaker (CB) reliability requirements needed for practical
   implementation. The proposed framework can be employed as a corrective
   tool in day to day operation planning scenarios in response to potential
   contingencies. The switching options are determined using an efficient
   heuristic algorithm based on DC optimal power flow, and are presented in
   a multi-branch tree structure. Then, the AC feasibility and stability
   checks are conducted and the CB condition monitoring data are employed
   to perform a CB reliability and line availability assessment.
   Ultimately, the operator will be offered multiple AC feasible and stable
   switching options with associated benefits. The operator can use this
   information, other operating conditions not explicitly considered in the
   optimization, and his/her own experience to implement the best and most
   reliable switching action(s). The effectiveness of the proposed approach
   is validated on the IEEE-118 bus test system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Chloramphenicol and dimetridazole are antimicrobial agents whose maximum
   limits of residues have not been yet determined; therefore, their use in
   animals intended for human consumption is forbidden, due to the
   deleterious consequences they produce. The aim of this investigation was
   to determine the presence of chloramphenicol and dimetridazole residues
   in kidneys from pigs slaughtered in Aragua state. Kidney samples from 11
   swine intensive facilities from Aragua state and nine from Carabobo
   state were randomly taken from October 2010 to March 2011. Subsequently,
   samples were submitted to the laboratory for processing and analysis
   using the High Performance Liquid Chromatography technique. Results
   showed the presence of chloramphenicol and dimetridazole residues in
   66.67\% of farms assessed in Carabobo state and no residues of these
   drugs in those from Aragua state. The average residue levels of
   chloramphenicol and dimetridazole in samples from farms established in
   the state of Carabobo were higher (P <0.05) compared to those from
   Aragua state, in which they were undetectable. These results highlight
   the issue of marketing animal products with antimicrobial residues
   harmful as for public health in Venezuela; on the other hand, they show
   the violation of standard regulations (Codex Alimentarius, Food and
   Agriculture Organization/ World Health Organization, Food and Drug

Abstract = {{Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate whether variation in
   pH of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) increased its antibacterial and
   dissolution ability on polymicrobial biofilms formed in situ.
   Materials and methods Fifty-six dentin blocks (eight/group) were
   intraorally infected for 48 h and incubated in BHI for 48 h to
   standardize the biofilm growth. The specimens were irrigated with 1 and
   2.5 \% NaOCl with pH levels of 5, 7, and 12 for 20 min. The control
   group was irrigated with distilled water. The cell viability and the
   bacterial volume were measured at the pre- and post-irrigation
   procedures. Five random areas of each sample were chosen and analyzed
   with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Statistical analysis was
   performed using the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's tests (p <
   0.05).
   Results All the experimental solutions were able to decrease the biomass
   (p < 0.05) except for the 1 \% NaOCl-pH 5 group. The antibacterial
   ability of the NaOCl was dependent on the concentration and
   acidification of the solution.
   Conclusions The acidification of NaOCl improves its antibacterial
   ability, but the dissolution effect of the irrigant is decreased.}},

   Estuary, South Wales}},
Journal = {{OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{116}},
Pages = {{478-490}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{An environmental risk assessment of the Loughor Estuary northern
   shoreline, in South Wales was carried out by adapting a previously
   developed Coastal Vulnerability Index). It was established utilising
   readily available physical parameters to determine vulnerabilities
   without the need for expert technical interpretation. The Coastal
   Vulnerability Index was used to determine vulnerability and to assess
   mesoscale applicability and simplicity of use for an estuarine
   environment. Assessments identified that the most critical physical
   parameters affecting vulnerability along this shoreline were coastal
   slope and beach width. Results highlighted that this shoreline was
   vulnerable and that a significant percentage of residential housing,
   transport and energy supply infrastructure are located in highly
   vulnerable areas. It was also noted that there is a concentration of
   future re-development sites in similarly vulnerable locations. The
   Coastal Vulnerability Index can be adapted depending on type of coastal
   environment and used as a planning tool to establish risk and
   vulnerability. This work demonstrates that the methodology can be
   adjusted for estuarine or coastal environments at local or regional
   scales, and can be used to justify in-depth studies for coastal defence.

   9.8 +/- 2.8 years, age range 6-13 years) and 40 age-similar controls
   were enrolled in this study. All children with asthma were taking
   inhaled fluticasone propionate at a dosage of 250 mu g or more per day
   for at least 1 year. The RNFL thickness measurements were performed
   using Cirrus HD spectral-domain OCT 400. Central subfield thickness,
   cube average thickness, and cube volume were also measured.
   Results: Among the 38 children with asthma and 40 healthy subjects who
   completed follow-up, children with asthma had similar mean peripapillary
   RNFL thicknesses compared with control children. The mean central
   subfield thickness was significantly higher than that of controls (248.8
   +/- 23.4 vs 237.5 +/- 23.5, p<0.037). There was a positive linear
   relationship between cube average thickness and eosinophil count with a
   Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.336 (p<0.039) and a negative
   correlation was found between central subfield thickness and disease
   duration (r = -0.385, p = 0.017) in children with asthma.
   Conclusions: Asthmatic children have similar peripapillary RNFL
   measurements compared to controls on spectral-domain OCT. Raised
   eosinophil counts in asthmatic children were found to be significantly
   associated with cube average thickness.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we revisit a 1986 article we published in this Journal,
   Meta-Analysis in Clinical Trials, where we introduced a random-effects
   model to summarize the evidence about treatment efficacy from a number
   of related clinical trials. Because of its simplicity and ease of
   implementation, our approach has been widely used (with more than 12,000
   citations to date) and the ``DerSimonian and Laird method{''} is now
   often referred to as the `standard approach' or a `popular' method for
   meta-analysis in medical and clinical research. The method is especially
   useful for providing an overall effect estimate and for characterizing
   the heterogeneity of effects across a series of studies. Here, we review
   the background that led to the original 1986 article, briefly describe
   the random-effects approach for meta-analysis, explore its use in
   various settings and trends over time and recommend a refinement to the
   method using a robust variance estimator for testing overall effect. We
   conclude with a discussion of repurposing the method for Big Data
   meta-analysis and Genome Wide Association Studies for studying the
   importance of genetic variants in complex diseases. Published by

Abstract = {{There is increasing interest in the use of high-performance reinforcing
   steel in concrete structures as a means to reduce the life-cycle costs
   of civil infrastructure. ASTM A1035 Grade 690 (100 ksi) steel offers
   improved corrosion resistance compared to traditional reinforcing
   steels. Efficient use of its higher strength can enable decreased
   reinforcement congestion. However, to efficiently exploit the available
   strength, sectional shear design models must adequately account for the
   higher expected strains in both longitudinal and transverse
   reinforcement. This paper presents the test results of eight
   shear-critical beams used to validate and enhance existing shear
   capacity models. Specimens were longitudinally reinforced with ASTM
   A1035 Grade 690 (100 ksi) steel and transversely reinforced with either
   ASTM A1035 Grade 690 (100 ksi) or ASTM A615 Grade 400 (60 ksi) steel.
   Overall specimen heights of 1000 mm (39.4 in.) and a constant shear
   span-depth ratio of 3.0 were used. The main test variables were the
   longitudinal reinforcement ratio and the steel type for the transverse
   reinforcement. The load-deflection response, ultimate load-carrying
   capacity, and mode of failure were of primary interest. The shear
   capacity of the new test specimens and other published data were
   compared against analytical shear design models. Good agreement in the
   shear capacity predictions was achieved from a modified form of the CSA
   A23.3 capacity model, which directly accounts for the reinforcement
   strains at the critical section.}},

Abstract = {{This manuscript uses item response theory (IRT) to estimate item
   characteristics of the Conditional Reasoning Test of Aggression (CRT-A).
   Using a sample size of 5,511 respondents, the present analysis provides
   an accurate assessment of the capability of the CRT-A to measure latent
   aggression. The one-parameter logistic (1PL) model, two-parameter
   logistic (2PL) model, and three-parameter logistic (3PL) model are
   compared before the item analysis. Results suggest that the 2PL model is
   the most appropriate dichotomous IRT model for describing the item
   characteristics of the CRT-A. Potential multdimensionality in the CRT-A
   is also examined. Results suggest that CRT-A items work as theoretically
   intended, with the probability of selecting an aggressive response
   increasing with latent trait levels. Information curves indicate that
   the CRT-A is best suited for use with individuals who are high on latent
   aggression. Exploratory analyses include an examination of polytomous
   IRT models and DIF comparing student and employee respondents. The
   results have implications for future research using the CRT-A as well as
   the identification of populations appropriate for measurement using this

Abstract = {{The genetic nature of bacterial wilt resistance was studied in bell
   pepper (Capsicum annuum L. var. grossum Sendt.) plants using the P-1,
   P-2, F-1, F-2 and backcross generations obtained from four crosses
   between four parental lines, viz, EC 464107, EC 464115, Kandaghat
   Selection and Sweet Happy I considered as standards for resistance
   and/or susceptibility. The evaluation trial was conducted in bacterial
   wilt sick plots along with two susceptible checks, namely Indira
   (Hybrid) and California Wonder (Open-pollinated variety) that were
   included after every 15th row to ensure uniform distribution of inoculum
   in the experimental fields. Simultaneously, in a separate block, the
   parents and their F-1,s were also evaluated for twelve different
   horticultural traits. The findings revealed that bacterial wilt
   resistance was governed by a single dominant gene in the cross EC 464107
   x Sweet Happy I, whereas two genes with dominant and recessive epistasis
   dictated resistance in the crosses EC 464107 x Kandaghat Selection and
   EC 464115 x Kandaghat Selection, respectively. Based upon the mean
   performance, the hybrid EC 464107 x Kandaghat Selection was the best in
   terms of total and marketable fruit yield, fruits per plant and fruit
   length, which underscores its importance to be exploited, especially
   during wet season. In addition, the resistant parents EC 464107 and EC
   464115 can be used to develop bacterial wilt resistant F-1 hybrids as
   they expressed complete or near complete dominance for resistance in
   combination with the moderately resistant and susceptible varieties
   Kandaghat Selection and Sweet Happy I. Backcrossing with commercial
   cultivars and recombinant breeding accompanied by selection would also
   help to evolve bacterial wilt disease resistant, high yielding and
   horticulturally desirable pure line varieties.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Lakes are important habitats for biogeochemical cycling of carbon. The
   organization and structure of aquatic communities influences the
   biogeochemical interactions between lakes and the atmosphere.
   Understanding how trophic structure regulates ecosystem functions and
   influences greenhouse gas efflux from lakes is critical to understanding
   global carbon cycling and climate change. With a whole-lake experiment
   in which a previously fishless lake was divided into two treatment
   basins where fish abundance was manipulated, we show how a trophic
   cascade from fish to microbes affects methane efflux to the atmosphere.
   Here, fish exert high grazing pressure and remove nearly all
   zooplankton. This reduction in zooplankton density increases the
   abundance of methanotrophic bacteria, which in turn reduce CH4 efflux
   rates by roughly 10 times. Given that globally there are millions of
   lakes emitting methane, an important greenhouse gas, our findings that
   aquatic trophic interactions significantly influence the biogeochemical
   cycle of methane has important implications.}},

Journal = {{MARINE AND PETROLEUM GEOLOGY}},

Pages = {{512-525}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Clay-rich shales form the overburden in many sedimentary basins and the
   seals to hydrocarbon accumulations in the subsurface. Their strength
   properties are not well understood and they are not often cored or
   carefully preserved to allow laboratory measurement of their properties.
   This paper presents the results of geomechanical tests carried out on a
   global suite of temporally and spatially diverse shales in terms of
   unconfined compressive strengths, cohesive strengths and friction
   coefficients. These shales were also extensively characterised in terms
   of their composition, porosity, physicochemical properties, grain size
   and rock physics response in order to derive empirical correlations to
   shale strength. The dataset was expanded using measurements published in
   the open literature along with some proprietary measurements. What might
   have been presumed to be good relationships such as strength with
   velocity or friction coefficient with clay content/porosity were found
   not to be the case. The best correlations were between strength and
   porosity or bulk cation exchange capacity. A correlation between

Title = {{Efficient Foreground Extraction From HEVC Compressed Video for
   Application to Real-Time Analysis of Surveillance `Big' Data}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{While surveillance video is the biggest source of unstructured Big Data
   today, the emergence of high-efficiency video coding (HEVC) standard is
   poised to have a huge role in lowering the costs associated with
   transmission and storage. Among the benefits of HEVC over the legacy
   MPEG-4 Advanced Video Coding (AVC), is a staggering 40 percent or more
   bitrate reduction at the same visual quality. Given the bandwidth
   limitations, video data are compressed essentially by removing spatial
   and temporal correlations that exist in its uncompressed form. This
   causes compressed data, which are already de-correlated, to serve as a
   vital resource for machine learning with significantly fewer samples for
   training. In this paper, an efficient approach to foreground
   extraction/segmentation is proposed using novel spatio-temporal
   de-correlated block features extracted directly from the HEVC compressed
   video. Most related techniques, in contrast, work on uncompressed images
   claiming significant storage and computational resources not only for
   the decoding process prior to initialization but also for the feature
   selection/extraction and background modeling stage following it. The
   proposed approach has been qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated
   against several other state-of-the-art methods.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Endoscopic resection is increasingly utilized for treating
   early stage esophageal cancer, and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)
   frequently guides treatment selection. Studies report greater than 80\%
   sensitivity and 90\% specificity, but our experience suggests less
   accuracy at the gastroesophageal (GE) junction. The objective of this
   study is to determine the accuracy of EUS for depth of GE junction
   cancer and the potential treatment implications.
   Methods. A retrospective review of a prospective database was performed
   for patients from 1995 to 2014 with GE junction esophageal cancer that
   underwent EUS staging and resection (surgical or endoscopic) without
   neo-adjuvant therapy. Patient, tumor, EUS, and pathologic
   characteristics were examined.
   Results. For the 181 patients that met criteria, the median age was 66
   years, 17\% were female, 91\% white, and 98\% had adenocarcinoma.
   Concordance between EUS (u) T and pathologic (p) T was 48\%, with 23\%
   under-staged and 29\% over-staged. The EUS was accurate in the
   following: uT0 6\% (1 of 18); uT1a 56\% (23 of 41); uT1b 58\% (41 of
   71); uT2 10\% (2 of 21); and uT3 70\% (21 of 30). Inaccurate EUS depth
   had potential to lead to overtreatment in 38\% (27 of 71) of uT1b and
   76\% (16 of 21) of uT2. In 50\% of pT1a tumors, EUS depth was T1b or
   greater. Logistic regression revealed tumor length (continuous variable)
   to be associated with inaccurate uT (p = 0.016). Accurately staged
   tumors were significantly longer than inaccurately staged tumors (2.7 vs
   1.7 cm, p = 0.011).
   Conclusions. Early to intermediate GE junction tumors are frequently
   over-staged. This highlights the importance of diagnostic endoscopic
   resection for determining accurate tumor depth and selecting correct
   therapy. (C) 2015 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons}},

Abstract = {{Background: Application of self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) to treat
   patients suffering from malignant gastroduodenal outlet obstruction
   (GDOO) is today considered a well-recognized palliative treatment. Use
   of SEMS has emerged as an attractive alternative to surgical treatment
   of such patients.
   Purpose: To report the immediate and the mid-term clinical outcomes from
   a series of consecutive patients treated with exclusively
   fluoroscopic-guided insertion of SEMS.
   Material and Methods: This was a retrospective study including patients
   suffering from GDOO that were either ineligible for or unwilling to
   undergo surgery. Patients with potentially curable disease,
   uncorrectable coagulopathy, gastrointestinal perforation, sepsis,
   presence of distal small bowel obstruction, and bowel ischemia were
   excluded. Technical success, clinical success, and major complications
   were calculated. In addition, stent migration, stent re-obstruction,
   restenosis, and overall re-interventions due to recurrent symptoms were
   considered. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used for patient survival
   estimation while both bivariable and multivariable analysis were
   performed to identify any independent predictors of outcomes.
   Results: Fifty-one patients, (mean age, 63.7315.62 years) met the
   study's criteria and were included in the final analysis. Technical and
   clinical success were 90.19\% (n=46/51) and 91.30\% (n=42/46),
   respectively. Major complications rate was 3.92\%. Stent migration was
   noted in four cases. Restenosis and re-obstruction rates were 19.57\%
   and 10.87\%, respectively. No cases of peri-procedural mortality were
   noted, while Kaplan-Meier estimates for 1- and 2-year survival were
   16.8\% and 7.2\%, respectively. Clinically successful cases and patients
   with primary GI tumor were related with more favorable survival compared
   to unsuccessful and patients suffering from GDOO due to extrinsic
   compression by neoplastic or lymph node disease.
   Conclusion: Exclusively fluoroscopically inserted SEMS for GDOO is safe
   and highly effective method for palliative treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Mitochondria play a central role in stem cell homeostasis. Reversible
   switching between aerobic and anaerobic metabolism is critical for stem
   cell quiescence, multipotency, and differentiation, as well as for cell
   reprogramming. However, the effect of mitochondrial dysfunction on
   neural stem cell (NSC) function is unstudied. We have generated an
   animal model with homozygous deletion of the succinate dehydrogenase
   subunit D gene restricted to cells of glial fibrillary acidic protein
   lineage (hGFAP-SDHD mouse). Genetic mitochondrial damage did not alter
   the generation, maintenance, or multipotency of glia-like central NSCs.
   However, differentiation to neurons and oligodendrocytes (but not to
   astrocytes) was impaired and, hence, hGFAP-SDHD mice showed extensive
   brain atrophy. Peripheral neuronal populations were normal in hGFAP-SDHD
   mice, thus highlighting their non-glial (non hGFAP(+)) lineage. An
   exception to this was the carotid body, an arterial chemoreceptor organ
   atrophied in hGFAP-SDHD mice. The carotid body contains glia-like adult
   stem cells, which, as for brain NSCs, are resistant to genetic
   mitochondrial damage.}},

Abstract = {{Hemoglobin S is an abnormal protein that induces morphological changes
   in erythrocyte in low -oxygen conditions. In Mexico, it is reported that
   up to 13.7\% of the population with mutation in one allele are
   considered asymptomatic (sickle cell trait). The sickle cell trait and
   diabetes mellitus are conditions that occur together in more than one
   million patients worldwide. Both diseases possibly produce microvascular
   changes in retinopathy and acute chest syndrome. The aim of this study
   was to evaluate the induction of sickle cells in samples of diabetic
   patients with sickle cell trait to identify altered red cell parameters.
   We obtained samples of diabetic patients to determine hemoglobin Al c
   and S; furthermore, red blood cell biometrics data were analyzed. We
   found that older men with diabetes were susceptible to generate sickle
   cells and this correlated with reduced red blood cell count and an
   increase in media cell volume, In samples of women diabetes, there were
   no differences. We conclude that samples from patients with sickle cell
   trait and diabetes can cause sickle cells with high frequency in men,
   with lower red blood cells count and increased mean corpuscular volume
   as susceptibility parameters.}},

Abstract = {{In their 1994 publication, Starkes and Lindley considered whether
   perceptual skill could be trained through the observation of video
   simulations of sport situations. We return to this topic 20 years later
   and provide a critical review of the subsequent research on perceptual
   learning in sport. We reflect on the implications from recent empirical
   evidence, which indicates that perceptual expertise in sport is best
   captured using experimental methods that allow participants to perceive
   and act (i.e., produce an interceptive action) against an opponent in
   real-time. Despite the pertinent implications that these findings have
   for the training of perceptual skill, until now, a review has not been
   forthcoming. Specifically, we consider the implications of an ecological
   approach to perceptual learning for training interventions in sport. We
   provide a critical review of current literature, before focussing on an
   ecological theory of learning as a framework for our perspective. We
   then overview two contemporary topics in ecological psychology -
   continuum of contact and between-participant variability in
   perception-action - before considering the implications of our
   perspective for future research.}},

Abstract = {{The International Prognostic Score (IPS-7) is the most commonly used
   risk stratification tool for advanced Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), however
   recent studies suggest the IPS-7 is less discriminating due to improved
   outcomes with contemporary therapy. We evaluated the seven variables for
   IPS-7 recorded at study entry for 854 patients enrolled on Eastern
   Cooperative Oncology Group 2496 trial. Univariate and multivariate Cox
   models were used to assess their prognostic ability for freedom from
   progression (FFP) and overall survival (OS). The IPS-7 remained
   prognostic however its prognostic range has narrowed. On multivariate
   analysis, two factors (age, stage) remained significant for FFP and
   three factors (age, stage, haemoglobin level) for OS. An alternative
   prognostic index, the IPS-3, was constructed using age, stage and
   haemoglobin level, which provided four distinct risk groups {[}FFP
   (P=0.0001) and OS (P<0.0001)]. IPS-3 outperformed the IPS-7 on risk
   prediction for both FFP and OS by model fit and discrimination criteria.
   Using reclassification calibration, 18\% of IPS-7 low risk patients were
   re-classified as intermediate risk and 13\% of IPS-7 intermediate risk
   patients as low risk. For patients with advanced HL, the IPS-3 may
   provide a simpler and more accurate framework for risk assessment in the
   modern era. Validation of these findings in other large data sets is
   planned.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND
   While it is known that excessive anxiety surrounding the measuring of
   blood pressure may preclude an accurate measurement, it is not known
   whether it could also lead to phobic avoidance behavior.
   METHODS
   Self-reported information was collected on 125 individuals who made
   postings on 5 internet-based medical forums.
   RESULTS
   Qualitative thematic analysis revealed that these individuals reported
   experiencing intense fear associated with the measuring of blood
   pressure, that was excessive or irrational and which contributed to
   avoidance of medical treatment and interference with life decisions.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Based on these preliminary observations, we are speculating that these
   symptoms could be considered consistent with a diagnosis of a Specific
   Phobia. Investigations using quantitative methods, representative
   samples, and standardized clinical instruments need to be conducted
   before definitive conclusions can be reached.}},

Abstract = {{The improvement of the efficiency of vehicle energy systems promotes an
   active search to find innovative solutions during the design process.
   Engineers can use computer-aided processes to find automatically the

   The idea is to obtain simultaneously a population of possible design
   solutions corresponding to the most efficient energy system definition
   for a vehicle. These solutions will be optimal from technical and
   economic point of view.
   In this article this kind of ``genetic intelligence{''} is tested for
   the holistic design of the optimal vehicle powertrain solutions and
   their optimal operating strategies.
   The methodology is applied on D class hybrid electric vehicles, in order
   to define the powertrain configurations, to estimate the cost of the
   powertrain equipment and to show the environmental impact of the
   technical choices. The optimal designs and operating strategies are
   researched for different vehicle usages - normalized, urban and long way

Abstract = {{Internationally, assessment is acknowledged as a critical aspect of
   pedagogical practice and accountability systems, and as having a
   fundamental bearing upon what knowledge and ways of articulating
   knowledge come to be valued in schools. Teachers' assessment literacy is
   arguably fundamental to their ability to successfully engage with
   multiple expectations of assessment and to facilitate assessment as a
   process that continually supports learning. Informed by Hay and Penney's
   ((2013) Assessment in Physical Education: A Sociocultural Perspective.
   London: Routledge) assessment literacy framework, a qualitative case
   study investigation was undertaken with 18 primary physical education
   teachers in a regional area in Australia to gain insight into their
   assessment practices. The study utilised informal interviews, survey and
   document analysis. Primary physical education teachers were shown to be
   engaging with the comprehension, application, interpretation and
   critical engagement elements of the assessment literacy framework,
   albeit with limitations. Assessment practices appear to be embedded in
   teaching practices but were, in the main, superficial. Data analysis
   highlighted gaps in knowledge about assessment, a focus on
   accountability and performance, and a lack of moderation and student
   engagement in assessment. This study directs attention to the tensions,
   uncertainties and complexities associated with developing assessment of
   physical education and the challenges associated with extending quality

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{141-147}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{By employing the perturbation formulae of the spin Hamiltonian
   parameters (SHPs) (g factors g(xx), g(yy), g(zz), hyperfine structure
   constants A(xx), A(yy), A(zz) and superhyperfine parameters A(xx)',
   A(yy)', A(zz)' ) for a 3d(1) ion in orthorhombically elongated octahedra
   and tetrahedra, the defect structures and the experimental EPR spectra
   are theoretically and systematically investigated for the two
   orthorhombic Ti3+ centers C-1 and C-2 in ZnWO4. Center C-1 is ascribed
   to the impurity Ti3+ at host W6+ site associated with two nearest
   neighbor oxygen vacancies due to charge compensation. The resultant
   tetrahedral {[}TiO4](5-) cluster is determined to undergo the local
   orthorhombic elongation distortion, characterized by the axial
   distortion angle Delta theta (=theta-theta(0) approximate to -6.84
   degrees) of the local impurity-ligand bond angle theta related to
   theta(0) ( approximate to 54.74 degrees) and the perpendicular
   distortion angle Delta epsilon (=epsilon-epsilon(0) approximate to 2.5
   degrees) related to so ( approximate to 45 degrees) of an ideal
   tetrahedron because of the Jahn-Teller effect. Center C-2 is attributed
   to Ti3+ on Zn2+ site, and this octahedral {[}TiO6](9-) cluster may
   experience the local axial elongation Delta Z ( approximate to 0.001
   angstrom) and the planar bond angle variation Delta phi ( approximate to
   9.1 degrees) due to the Jahn-Teller effect, resulting in a more regular
   oxygen octahedron. All the calculated SHPs (i.e., g factors for both
   centers, the hyperfine structure constants for center C-2 and
   superhyperfine parameters of next nearest neighbor ligand W for center
   C-1) show good agreement with the observed values. However, the
   theoretical results based on the previous assignment of center C-1 as
   Ti3+ on W6+ site with only one nearest planar oxygen vacancy (i.e.,
   five-fold coordinated octahedral {[}TiO5](7-) cluster) show much worse
   agreement with the experimental data. The defect structures and the SHPs
   (especially the g anisotropies) are discussed for both centers. The
   present studies on the superhyperfine parameters of ligand W6+ for
   center C-1 would be helpful to further investigations on the
   superhyperfine interactions of cation ligands which were rather scarcely
   treated before. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   base approach for microsurgical evacuation of a large basal ganglia
   hematoma through an endoport Patients who suffer from large spontaneous
   intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH) of the basal ganglia have a very poor
   prognosis. However, the benefit of surgery for the management of ICH is
   controversial. The development of endoport technology has allowed for
   minimally invasive access to subcortical lesions, and may offer unique
   advantages over conventional surgical techniques due to less disruption
   of the overlying cortex and white matter fiber tracts. A 77-year-old man
   presented with a hypertensive ICH of the right putamen, measuring 9 cm
   in maximal diameter and 168 cm(3) in volume. We planned an endoport
   trajectory through the long axis of the hematoma using frameless
   stereotactic neuronavigation. In order to access the optimal cortical
   entry point at the lateral aspect of the basal frontal lobe, a miniature
   modified orbitozygomatic skull base craniotomy was performed through an
   incision along the superior border of the right eyebrow. Using the
   BrainPath endoport system (NICO, Indianapolis, IN, USA), the putaminal
   hematoma was successfully evacuated, resulting in an 87\% postoperative
   reduction in ICH volume. Thus, we show that, in appropriately selected
   cases, endoport-assisted microsurgery is safe and effective for the
   evacuation of large ICH. Furthermore, minimally invasive anterior skull
   base approaches can be employed to expand the therapeutic potential of
   endoport-assisted approaches to include subcortical lesions, such as
   hematomas of the basal ganglia. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/manganese oxides (MnO2) composites are
   obtained from GO/MnO2 precursor by the microwave-assisted reducing
   procedures. Characterization indicates that the phase and morphology
   transformation have been discovered in GO/MnO2 composite for the first
   time, and this transition can be explained by a
   ``dissolution-precipitation{''} model. The capacitive properties of the
   rGO/MnO2 electrodes are measured using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and
   galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) tests. The rGO/Mn3O4 in hydrazine
   hydrate (H-rGO/Mn3O4) exhibits a specific capacitance as high as 324.9
   F/g, which is about four times as the GO/MnO2 precursor (81.25 F/g). It
   is deduced that the diversity of ionic state of Mn3O4, the large
   specific surface area, and the large reduction degree of GO are
   favorable to the enhancement of the electrochemical performance. The
   results show that the H-rGO/Mn3O4 nanocomposite from GO/MnO2 can be used
   as electrode material for high performance supercapacitors.}},

Abstract = {{A series of trimetallic Pd1NiyAl0.5 composite nanoparticles (the nominal
   atomic ratios of Pd:Ni:Al were 1:2:0.5,1:4:0.5 and 1:6:0.5,
   respectively) were produced onto multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)
   (denoted as Pd1NiyAl0.5/MWCNTs) using a hydrothermal process. The
   crystalline phases and morphologies of the samples were mainly featured
   using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Ethanol oxidation reaction
   (EOR), an important anodic reaction in direct ethanol fuel cells
   (DEFCs), was examined on the as- prepared catalysts principally by using
   cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA), and the results
   demonstrated that the catalyst of Pd1Ni4Al0.5/MWCNTs showed the best
   electrocatalytic performance among all the prepared samples. The
   relatively smaller particle size and higher polarized electrode
   potential were regarded as the major reasons for the excellent
   electrocatalytic activity of the Pd1Ni4Al0.5/MWCNTs towards EOR in

Abstract = {{This paper presents a holistic approach for safety and protection of
   historical buildings adjacent to tunneling excavation. A finite element
   model is built to simulate the impact of tunneling excavation on the
   distribution of structural stress of historical buildings, in order to
   determine stress concentration regions in materials and structures
   subjected to forces or loads. Some corresponding reinforcement measures
   are proposed according to simulative results, aiming to improve its
   structural integrity and rigidity of historical buildings to satisfy the
   load-bearing requirements prior to construction. The effectiveness of
   the adoption of reinforcement measures against tunnel-induced building
   damage is validated using a two-stage numerical simulation process,
   where the impact of the tunneling excavation on the deformation of
   surrounding soils and building foundations is simulated separately,
   given the reinforcement measures are implemented. A case in relating to
   the protection of a historical building of Roots' formal residence (RFR)
   adjacent to the construction of a twin tunnel, Wuhan Yangtze River
   Tunnel (WYRT) in China, is presented, where the tunnel in the east line
   passes under the foundation of RFR, and the nearest receiving shaft
   foundation in the west line is only 1.4 m away from the building
   foundation edge of RFR. Results demonstrate the feasibility of the
   proposed approach, as well as its application potential. The proposed
   approach can be used as a decision tool to provide some positive
   guidelines on the protection of historical buildings, and thus increase
   the likelihood of a successful project in tunneling environments. (C)

Abstract = {{One-dimensional (1D) Ag/AgBr/TiO2 nanofibres (NFs) have been
   successfully fabricated by the one-pot electrospinning method. In
   comparison with bare TiO2 NFs and Ag/AgBr/PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone)
   NFs, the 1D Ag/AgBr/TiO2 NFs photocatalyst exhibits much higher
   photocatalytic activity in the degradation of a commonly used dye,
   methylene blue (MB), under visible light. The photocatalytic removal
   efficiency of MB over Ag/AgBr/TiO2 NFs achieves almost 100 \% in 20 min.
   The photocatalytic reaction follows the first-order kinetics and the
   rate constant (k) for the degradation of MB by Ag/AgBr/TiO2 NFs is 5.2
   times and 6.6 times that of Ag/AgBr/PVP NFs and TiO2 NFs, respectively.
   The enhanced photocatalytic activity is ascribed to the stronger visible
   light absorption, more effective separation of photogenerated
   electron-hole pairs, and faster charge transfer in the long nanofibrous
   structure. The Ag/AgBr/TiO2 NFs maintain a highly stable photocatalytic
   activity due to its good structural stability and the self-stability
   system of Ag/AgBr. The mechanisms for photocatalysis associated with
   Ag/AgBr/TiO2 NFs are proposed. The degradation of MB in the presence of
   scavengers reveals that h(+) and O-center dot(2) significantly
   contribute to the degradation of MB. (C) 2015 Institute of Chemistry,

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to assess wood quality using diagnostic keys
   related to the main traits of trunk architecture in the most important
   resource of resonance spruce of the Romanian Carpathians. The material
   sampled from standing and felled trees yielded 568 individual ring
   series adding up to over 81,000 growth rings. The resonance xylotype was
   first recognized in felled trees, already designated for violin
   manufacture, for which a 6-class quality classification system was
   proposed. This system was extended to the qualitative classification of
   the standing trees (diameter at breast height larger than 10 cm). The
   width and regularity of the growth rings, the width of the sapwood and
   latewood, and the compression wood ratio are the variables that make
   recognition of trees containing resonance wood possible. Wood with
   resonance structural value was detected locally along the tree stem, and
   the best resonance structural quality was found uniformly distributed
   from 5 to 9 m above the ground and in the external half of the
   cross-section. Trees having a proper structure for violin fliches, but
   not yet with an appropriate size (38 cm underbark diameter), accounted
   for about 7\% of the total tree population.}},

   questions relating to the geophysics, geochemistry and geobiology of
   geodisposal of wastes, this paper describes the possibility of
   technology transfer from high-technology areas of the space exploration
   sector, including astrobiology, planetary sciences, astronomy, and also
   particle and nuclear physics, into geodisposal. Synergies exist between
   high technology used in the space sector and in the characterization of
   underground environments such as repositories, because of common
   objectives with respect to instrument miniaturization, low power
   requirements, durability under extreme conditions (in temperature and
   mechanical loads) and operation in remote or otherwise difficult to
   access environments.}},

Abstract = {{Fe-Ionic Imprinted Polymer (IIP) from polyeugenol as base polymer and

   been synthesized to adsorb Fe(III) from aqueous media. The
   non-imprinting material (NIP) and polyeugenol were used in the
   adsorption study as control. Synthesis work included polymerization,
   template uploading, crosslinking and template removal, optimized for
   different template ion upload pH and concentrations. The polymers were
   characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, XRD and SEM-EDX, followed by
   adsorption test to study the adsorption kinetics and isotherms for all
   adsorbents. Selective adsorption study of IIP was carried out using
   binary mixtures of Fe(III) and Cr(III), Pb(II), Cd(II). Experimental
   results showed that the optimum conditions for the synthesis was
   template upload pH of 3, Fe/polyeugenol ratio of 1 mg/g, while the
   optimum adsorption pH was 3. The adsorption mechanism of Fe(III) on all
   adsorbents was dominated by hydrogen bond formation. The adsorption
   kinetics followed the pseudo-second-order model while the equilibrium
   data was best explained by the Langmuir isotherm model. The adsorption
   capacity of Fe(III) on the IIP was 12.73 mg/g, higher than that of the
   other adsorbents. Results also show that IIP-Fe was more selective
   toward Fe than NIP by 2.69 (Cd), 1.66 (Cr) and 1.6 (Pb) fold,

Title = {{Evaluating Long-term Outcomes of NHS Stop Smoking Services (ELONS): a
   prospective cohort study}},
Journal = {{HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{95}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: NHS Stop Smoking Services (SSSs) provide free at the point
   of use treatment for smokers who would like to stop. Since their
   inception in 1999 they have evolved to offer a variety of support
   options. Given the changes that have happened in the provision of
   services and the ongoing need for evidence on effectiveness, the
   Evaluating Long-term Outcomes for NHS Stop Smoking Services (ELONS)
   study was commissioned.
   Objectives: The main aim of the study was to explore the factors that
   determine longer-term abstinence from smoking following intervention by
   SSSs. There were also a number of additional objectives.
   Design: The ELONS study was an observational study with two main stages:
   secondary analysis of routine data collected by SSSs and a prospective
   cohort study of service clients. The prospective study had additional
   elements on client satisfaction, well-being and longer-term nicotine
   replacement therapy (NRT) use.
   Setting: The setting for the study was SSSs in England. For the
   secondary analysis, routine data from 49 services were obtained. For the
   prospective study and its added elements, nine services were involved.
   The target population was clients of these services.
   Participants: There were 202,804 cases included in secondary analysis
   and 3075 in the prospective study. Interventions: A combination of
   behavioural support and stop smoking medication delivered by SSS
   practitioners.
   Main outcome measures: Abstinence from smoking at 4 and 52 weeks after
   setting a quit date, validated by a carbon monoxide (CO) breath test.
   Results: Just over 4 in 10 smokers (41\%) recruited to the prospective
   study were biochemically validated as abstinent from smoking at 4 weeks
   (which was broadly comparable with findings from the secondary analysis
   of routine service data, where self-reported 4-week quit rates were
   48\%, falling to 34\% when biochemical validation had occurred). At the
   1-year follow-up, 8\% of prospective study clients were CO validated as
   abstinent from smoking. Clients who received specialist one-to-one
   behavioural support were twice as likely to have remained abstinent than
   those who were seen by a general practitioner (GP) practice and pharmacy
   providers {[}odds ratio (OR) 2.3, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.2 to
   4.6]. Clients who received group behavioural support (either closed or
   rolling groups) were three times more likely to stop smoking than those
   who were seen by a GP practice or pharmacy providers (OR 3.4, 95\% CI
   1.7 to 6.7). Satisfaction with services was high and well-being at
   baseline was found to be a predictor of abstinence from smoking at
   longer-term follow-up. Continued use of NRT at 1 year was rare, but no
   evidence of harm from longer-term use was identified from the data
   collected.
   Conclusions: Stop Smoking Services in England are effective in helping
   smokers to move away from tobacco use. Using the 52-week CO-validated
   quit rate of 8\% found in this study, we estimate that in the year
   2012-13 the services supported 36,249 clients to become non-smokers for
   the remainder of their lives. This is a substantial figure and provides
   one indicator of the ongoing value of the treatment that the services
   provide. The study raises a number of issues for future research
   including (1) examining the role of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes)
   in smoking cessation for service clients {[}this study did not look at
   e-cigarette use (except briefly in the longer-term NRT study) but this
   is a priority for future studies]; (2) more detailed comparisons of
   rolling groups with other forms of behavioural support; (3) further
   exploration of the role of practitioner knowledge, skills and use of
   effective behaviour change techniques in supporting service clients to
   stop smoking; (4) surveillance of the impact of structural and funding
   changes on the future development and sustainability of SSSs; and (5)
   more detailed analysis of well-being over time between those who
   successfully stop smoking and those who relapse. Further research on
   longer-term use of non-combustible nicotine products that measures a
   wider array of biomarkers of smoking-related harm such as lung function
   tests or carcinogen metabolites.}},

Abstract = {{Tinnitus is a symptom usually related to cochlear change that may arise
   from noise exposure and induces expression of proinflammatory cytokines
   including interleukin-6 (IL6). This study aimed to evaluate the
   association between the polymorphism of the IL6 gene in the region
   174G/C and tinnitus in elderly with history of occupational noise
   exposure. Settings and Design: This was a cross-sectional study with a
   sample of 179 independent elderly individuals aged >60 years.
   Information on exposure to occupational noise was obtained by
   interviews. Audiological evaluation was performed using pure tone
   audiometry and genotyped through polymerase chain reaction by
   restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Data were analyzed
   using the chi-square test and the odds ratio (OR), with the significance
   level set at 5\%. Among the study subjects, 24.6\% were homozygous for
   the G allele, 39.7\% were homozygous for the C allele, and 35.8\% were
   heterozygous for IL6 (P > 0.05). Of these, 33.5\% reported noise
   exposure history, with 42.5\% having tinnitus. We found significant
   association between the genotype and allele frequencies of the IL6-174
   gene (rs1800795) and tinnitus among the elderly with history of exposure
   to occupational noise (P = 0.03). The elderly with the C allele were
   less likely to have tinnitus associated with history of exposure to
   occupational noise {[}OR = 0.167, confidence interval (CI) 95\%
   0.167-0.749; P = 0.004] when compared to those carrying the G allele.
   This study suggests that there is an association between polymorphisms
   in the IL6 gene at region - 174G/C and susceptibility to tinnitus.}},

Abstract = {{Using PERPLEX and garnet isopleth thermobarometry we tested whether
   Permian metasediments, orthogneisses, and amphibolitized eclogites from
   the Nevado-Filabride Complex in the western Sierra Nevada (Betics,
   Spain) underwent the same high-pressure metamorphism, or whether the
   different lithologies were tectonically emplaced after metamorphism as
   is commonly assumed. Our results highlight the role of some accessory
   minerals, especially small inclusions of Ti-bearing phases (mainly
   titanite and rutile) in garnet, in the thermobarometric estimates and
   indicate the presence of several populations of garnets in the
   orthogneisses recording different stages of the prograde and
   retrogressive Alpine metamorphic path in addition to pre-Alpine garnets.
   The schists also contain two populations of garnet: rare detrital grains
   and metamorphic crystals. Despite the scarcity of key phases proving
   that the orthogneisses and metasediments experienced high-pressure
   conditions, this study yields a number of lines of evidence suggesting
   that both rock types followed a clockwise pressure-temperature path
   similar to the eclogites, reaching peak pressures of 2.0-2.2 GPa for
   temperatures of 550-600 degrees C, and that the lithologies were all in
   contact prior to the high-pressure Alpine event.}},

   disrupting the maturation of prefrontal-hippocampal networks}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{High-prevalence/low-severity cognitive deficits represent the life-long
   burden of a perinatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) insult. They have been
   proposed to result from dysmaturation of prelimbic-hippocampal networks,
   which account for mnemonic and executive performance. Already at
   neonatal age the communication within these networks is largely reduced
   after an early HI insult with mild/moderate structural outcome. However,
   the long-lasting consequences of the neonatal network dysfunction remain
   unknown. Here, we combine MRI and electrophysiology in vivo with
   behavioral testing to assess the effects of an early HI insult on the
   structure and function of prelimbic-hippocampal networks and on related
   cognitive abilities of juvenile rats. Despite the absence of lesions
   over the prelimbic cortex (PL) and hippocampus (HP), juvenile rats
   experiencing an early HI have lower performance in item and temporal
   order recognition memory. These cognitive deficits do not result from
   delayed somatic development or increased locomotion or anxiety. More
   likely, abnormal activity patterns and interactions within
   prelimbic-hippocampal networks account for behavioral impairment. The
   early HI insult causes power reduction of the fast (12-48 Hz) network
   activity and diminishment of neuronal firing in the PL and HP. This
   weaker entrainment of local circuits at juvenile age emerges in the
   absence of sufficiently strong directed interactions within neonatal
   prelimbic-hippocampal networks. Similar developmental mechanisms may
   account for poorer academic achievements of HI-injured infants. (C) 2015

Volume = {{472}},
Pages = {{119-125}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the capacity of organisms to cope with projected global
   warming through acclimation and adaptation is critical to predicting
   their likely future persistence. The vast majority of research on
   tropical species suggests they will be substantially negatively affected
   by future warming and have limited capacity to acclimate to changes.
   This study tested whether the spine cheek anemonefish, Premnas
   biaculeatus, has the capacity for developmental thermal acclimation of
   metabolic attributes and critical thermal maximum (CTmax) to increasing
   sea water temperature. Juveniles of P. biaculeatus exhibited high
   capacity for developmental thermal acclimation of aerobic physiology.
   Fish reared at + 1.5 degrees C and + 3.0 degrees C above present-day
   mean temperatures possessed enhanced performance across all testing
   temperatures (28.5 degrees C to 31.5 degrees C), i.e. overcompensation.
   Specifically, this occurred through increases in maximum oxygen
   consumption (MO2Maximum) that resulted in elevations in both net and
   factorial aerobic scope. In addition, fish reared at +1.5 degrees C also
   exhibited a partial increase in critical thermal maximum (CTmax) by 0.5
   degrees C, however no increase was observed in fish reared at +3.0
   degrees C. Fish reared at +3.0 degrees C were significantly longer,
   heavier and in better condition than + 0.0 degrees C present-day fish,
   suggesting that alterations to aerobic physiology correspond to
   enhancement of growth and condition as would be predicted with the
   oxygen and capacity limited thermal tolerance hypothesis. These results
   indicate that the acclimation to future warming may produce overall
   enhanced performance in some species. It also suggests that the
   developmental acclimation ability varies substantially between species
   within the same family and a greater understanding of promoted or
   reduced acclimation capacity will be critically important to predicting
   the impacts of climate change on coral reef systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Despite multimodal treatment, glioblastoma (GBM) therapy with
   temozolomide (TMZ) remains inefficient due to chemoresistance. Matrix
   metalloproteinase (MMP) and a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM),
   increased in GBM, could contribute to chemoresistance and TMZ-induced
   recurrence of glioblastoma.
   TMZ inducibility of metalloproteases was determined in GBM cell lines,
   primary GBM cells, and tissues from GBM and recurrent GBM. TMZ
   sensitivity and invasiveness of GBM cells were assessed in the presence
   of the metalloprotease inhibitors batimastat (BB-94) and marimastat
   (BB-2516). Metalloprotease-dependent effects of TMZ on mitochondria and
   pAkt/phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) and phosphorylated
   extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (pERK1/2) pathways were
   analyzed by fluorescence activated cell sorting, morphometry, and
   immunoblotting. Invasiveness of GBM cells was determined by Matrigel
   invasion assays. Potential metalloprotease substrates were identified by
   proteomics and tested for invasion using blocking antibodies.
   TMZ induces expression of MMP-1, -9, -14, and ADAM8 in GBM cells and in
   recurrent GBM tissues. BB-94, but not BB-2516 (ADAM8-sparing) increased
   TMZ sensitivity of TMZ-resistant and -nonresistant GBM cells with
   different O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase states, suggesting
   that ADAM8 mediates chemoresistance, which was confirmed by ADAM8
   knockdown, ADAM8 overexpression, or pharmacological inhibition of ADAM8.
   Levels of pAkt and pERK1/2 were increased in GBM cells and correlated
   with ADAM8 expression, cell survival, and invasiveness. Soluble
   hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) R/c-met and CD44 were identified as
   metalloprotease substrates in TMZ-treated GBM cells. Blocking of HGF
   R/c-met prevented TMZ-induced invasiveness.
   ADAM8 causes TMZ resistance in GBM cells by enhancing pAkt/PI3K,
   pERK1/2, and cleavage of CD44 and HGF R/c-met. Specific ADAM8 inhibition
   can optimize TMZ chemotherapy of GBM in order to prevent formation of
   recurrent GBM in patients.}},

Abstract = {{This technical note studies the stability problem of homogeneous
   positive systems of any degree with time-varying delays.
   Delay-independent conditions are derived for asymptotic and finite-time
   stability. Estimates on the decay rates, which reveal how the system
   delays affect the rates of convergence, are obtained. More precisely,
   this technical note features three contributions. First, we derive a
   necessary and sufficient condition for global polynomial stability of
   continuous-time homogeneous cooperative systems with time-varying delays
   when the degree of homogeneity is greater than one. Second, we
   characterize finite-time stability of continuous-time homogeneous
   cooperative delay-free systems of degree smaller than one. Finally, for
   discrete-time positive systems with time-varying delays, a local
   exponential stability criterion is established when the vector fields
   are order-preserving and homogeneous of degree greater than one. An
   illustrative example is given to show the effectiveness of our results.}},

Abstract = {{The bulk AlCrFeNiMo0.2 high-entropy alloy was successfully prepared by
   vacuum medium frequency induction melting. The effects of
   electromagnetic field on microstructure and properties were
   investigated. The alloy possessed a mixed structure of B2 and BCC, and
   the phase types were not changed by the electromagnetic field treatment.
   The microstructure exhibited typical lamellar eutectic cell and rod
   eutectic cell structures. These eutectic cell structures were
   constituted by the AlNi-type intermetallic compound and the FeCr-type
   solid solution. With the increase of electromagnetic field intensity,
   the hardness increases, while the compressive fracture strength and
   fracture strain of the alloy first increases and then decreases. The
   alloy with 15 mT electromagnetic field has the largest fracture strength
   2282.3 MPa, yield strength 1160.5 MPa, and fracture strain 0.29. The
   alloy shows typical ferromagnetic behavior, and the homogenized lamellar
   eutectic cell microstructure significantly decreased the specific
   saturation magnetizations.}},

Abstract = {{Deep convolutional network cascade has been successfiffly applied for
   face alignment. The configuration of each network, including the
   selecting strategy of local patches for training and the input range of
   local patches, is crucial for achieving desired performance. In this

   Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (ACDCNN) which adjusts the cascade
   structure adaptively. Gaussian distribution is utilized to bridge the
   successive networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed
   ACDCNN achieves the state-of-the-art in accuracy, but with reduced model

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new conditional power and rate adaptation scheme for
   orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems is proposed in
   the presence of carrier frequency offset (CFO), with perfect and
   imperfect channel state information (CSI). The conventional adaptive
   scheme is shown to be a special case of the conditionally adaptive
   scheme technique that enables the resulting nonconvex optimization
   problem, which is solved in a feasible way. It leads to a solution for
   optimal power adaptation that maximizes the spectral efficiency of an
   OFDM system using M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (MQAM) under
   average power and instantaneous bit error rate (BER) constraints.
   Closed-form expressions for the average spectral efficiency (ASE) of
   adaptive OFDM systems are derived for perfect and imperfect CSI cases.
   The theoretical results and computer simulations show that range of the
   conditional adaptation becomes narrow and the performance of constant
   power and continuous rate is very close to that of the conditionally
   adaptive power and continuous rate for higher CFO or high
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2A (LGMD2A) is the most
   frequent LGMD variant in the European population, representing about
   40\% of LGMD. The c.550delA mutation in the CANP3 (calcium activated
   neutral protease 3) gene is the most commonly reported mutation in
   LGMD2A. Prevalence of this mutation in the Polish population has not
   been previously investigated. The aim of this study was to identify and
   estimate the frequency of the c.550delA mutation in Polish LGMD2A
   patients. Methods: Polymerase chain reaction-sequencing analysis,
   restriction fragment length polymorphism polymerase chain reaction
   method. Results: We analyzed 76 families affected with LGMD and
   identified 62 probands with mutations in the CANP3 gene. C.550delA was
   the most common mutation identified, being found in 78\% of the LGMD2A
   families. The remaining mutations observed multiple times were as
   follows: c.598-612del15ntd; c.2242C>T; c.418dupC; c.1356insT, listed in
   terms of decreasing frequency. Two novel variants in the CANP3 gene,
   that is, c.700G>A Gly234Arg and c.661G>A Gly221Ser were also
   characterized. Overall, mutations in the LGMD2A gene were estimated to
   be present in 81\% of patients with the LGMD phenotype who were without
   sarcoglycans and dysferlin deficiency on immunocytochemical analysis.
   The frequency of the heterozygous c.550delA mutation in the healthy
   Polish population was estimated at 1/124. Conclusions: The c.550delA is
   the most frequent CANP3 mutation in the Polish population, thus
   sequencing of exon 4 of this gene could identify the majority of LGMD2A
   patients in Poland.}},

Abstract = {{Low- and middle-income countries have a high number of orphans, many of

   existing rapid ethnographic assessment approach to identify mental
   health problems from the perspective of orphans and guardians to inform
   a subsequent randomized controlled trial of a Western-developed,
   evidence-based psychosocial intervention, Trauma-focused Cognitive
   Behavioral Therapy. Local Kiswahili-speaking interviewers conducted 73
   free list interviews and 34 key informant interviews. Results identified
   both common cross-cultural experiences and symptoms as well as uniquely
   described symptoms (e.g., lacking peace, being discriminated against)
   not typically targeted by the intervention or included on standardized

Abstract = {{Introduction: To analyze the prevalence of congenital anomalies detected
   at birth among children of pregnant adolescents, emphasizing the most
   common types and the time of diagnosis.
   Material and Methods: Retrospective study of type census, in which were
   analyzed in all newborns, living or dead, weighing more than 500 g of
   women who gave birth at Hospital Sao Paulo in a period of six years. The
   fetuses bearing anomalies were identified prenatally or through
   postnatal physical examination period, according to the criteria of the
   Latin American Collaborative Study of Congenital Malformations. The
   results were expressed descriptively using absolute and relative values,
   the prevalence of anomalies was calculated, as well as the comparison
   between groups using nonparametric tests.
   Results: We analyzed 6 257 pregnancies, of which 577 newborns had some
   congenital anomaly identified at birth (prevalence 9.2\%). Among these 6
   257, 907 were adolescents, which showed a 9.9\% prevalence of anomalies
   among their newborns. There was no significant difference between the
   presence of abnormalities in newborns of adolescents and women with age
   greater than or equal to 20 years. About 56\% of congenital anomalies
   were diagnosed in the prenatal period. We observed a higher prevalence
   of defects of neural tube between newborns of adolescents (p = 0.027).
   Discussion: We observed high rate of deliveries in adolescents, higher
   than developed countries. We observed also high frequency of congenital
   anomalies in newborns, probably because our tertiary reference center.
   The high prevalence of neural tube defect among young pregnant women
   could be explained by the absent of acid folic supplementation in
   non-planned gestations which is typical of adolescents.
   Conclusion: The prevalence and time of diagnosis of congenital anomalies
   showed similar behavior among newborns of teenagers and women with age
   greater than or equal to 20 years, except for the defects of the neural
   tube, which were more prevalent among newborns of teenagers.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose:To investigate and compare corneal biomechanical changes in the
   form of corneal hysteresis (CH) and corneal resistance factor (CRF)
   after small-incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) and laser-assisted
   subepithelial keratectomy (LASEK).Methods:In this retrospective
   observational study, patients who underwent either SMILE (36 eyes, 21
   patients) or LASEK (35 eyes, 19 patients) were included. Data were
   collected preoperatively and at 1 and 3 months postoperatively, which
   included corneal topography and Ocular Response Analyzer values of CH,
   CRF, and intraocular pressure (IOP). Differences between both surgical
   groups and the relationships between variables were
   evaluated.Results:CH, CRF, Goldmann IOP, and corneal compensated IOP
   after surgery were significantly lower than the preoperative values (P <
   0.05) in both surgical groups. Lenticule thickness (LT) correlated with
   CRF ( = postoperative - preoperative value) in the SMILE group (r =
   -0.513, P = 0.001), but the ablation depth (AD) and CRF showed no
   correlation in the LASEK group (r = -0.297, P = 0.083). In the SMILE
   group, CRF/LT (-0.036 0.01) and CH/LT (-0.021 +/- 0.01) values were
   significantly lower than CRF/AD (-0.048 +/- 0.02) and CH/AD (-0.026 +/-
   0.02) values in the LASEK group (P < 0.05).Conclusions:Both SMILE and
   LASEK alter corneal biomechanical strength. However, the changes induced
   by SMILE are more predictable than those induced by LASEK. In terms of
   per unit tissue removed, SMILE seems to have less effect on corneal
   biomechanics than LASEK, which may be due to preservation of the stiffer
   anterior stroma.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Emergency medicine (EM) is a recently recognized specialty
   in India, still in its infancy. Local training programs are developing,
   but remain very limited. Private, for-profit hospitals are an important
   provider of graduate medical education (GME) in India, and are
   partnering with United States (US) universities in EM to expand training
   opportunities. Objective: Our aim was to describe current private-sector
   programs affiliated with a US university providing postgraduate EM
   training in India, the evolution and structure of these programs, and
   successes and challenges of program implementation. Discussion: Programs
   have been established in seven cities in India in partnership with a US
   academic institution. Full-time trainees have required didactics,
   clinical rotations, research, and annual examinations. Faculty members
   affiliated with the US institution visit each program monthly. Regular
   evaluations have informed program modifications, and a local faculty
   development program has been implemented. Currently, 240 trainees are
   enrolled in the EM postgraduate program, and 141 physicians have
   graduated. A pilot survey conducted in 2012 revealed that 93\% of
   graduates are currently practicing EM, 82\% of those in India; 71\% are
   involved in teaching, and 32\% in research. Further investigation into
   programmatic impacts is necessary. Challenges include issues of formal
   program recognition both in India and abroad. Conclusions: This unique
   partnership is playing a major early role in EMGME in India. Future
   steps include official program recognition, expanded numbers of training
   sites, and a gradual transition of training and education to local
   faculty. Similar partnership programs may be effective in other settings
   outside of India. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background: Epidural analgesia and remifentanil patient-controlled
   analgesia are two popular techniques for the treatment of labour pain,
   each with its own efficacy and toxicity.
   Methods: Parturients requesting analgesia were randomly assigned to
   either patient-controlled intravenous remifentanil or epidural
   analgesia. Control patients consisted of parturients not requesting pain
   medication. The primary objective was to compare the incidence of
   maternal fever (temperature >= 38 degrees C); secondary outcomes
   included the incidence of low oxygen saturation, pain scores, nausea and
   vomiting, sedation scores, pruritus and neonatal outcome.
   Results: Data from 140 parturients were analysed: 49 received
   remifentanil analgesia, 49 epidural analgesia and 42 no analgesia
   (controls). Fever (temperature >= 38 degrees C) developed in 10\% of
   remifentanil patients compared to 37\% of epidural patients and 7\% of
   control patients (P <0.001). One or more hypoxaemic events (oxygen
   saturation <90\% for at least 1 min) occurred in 48\% of patients on
   remifentanil versus 15\% of patients on epidural analgesia and 20\% of
   control patients (P=0.003). Although pain ntensity scores differed
   significantly between the two groups in favour of the epidural, mean
   satisfaction scores were similar in both analgesia groups (remifentanil
   8.1 +/- 1.2 vs. epidural 8.4 +/- 1.2). Remifentanil analgesia was
   associated with a higher incidence of nausea and deeper levels of
   sedation. The differences in haemodynamic parameters between groups were
   small and clinically insignificant.
   Conclusions: During treatment of labour pain, epidural analgesia is
   associated with a higher incidence of maternal fever, while remifentanil
   analgesia results in more frequent and deeper hypoxaemic events. (C)

Abstract = {{It has been suggested that the activation of speech-motor areas during
   speech comprehension may, in part, reflect the involvement of the speech
   production system in synthesizing upcoming material at an articulatorily
   specified level. In this study, we explored that suggestion through the
   use of articulatory imaging. We investigated whether, and how,
   predictions that emerge during speech comprehension influence
   articulatory realizations during picture naming. We elicited predictions
   by auditorily presenting high-cloze sentence stems to participants
   (e.g., When we want water we just turn on the . . .). Participants named
   a picture immediately following each sentence-stem presentation. The
   pictures either matched (e.g., TAP) or mismatched (e.g., CAP) the
   high-cloze sentence-stem target. Throughout each trial, participants'
   speech-motor movements were recorded via dynamic ultrasound imaging.
   This allowed us to compare articulations in the match and mismatch
   conditions to each other and to a control condition (simple picture
   naming). Articulations in the mismatch condition differed more from the
   control condition than did those in the match condition. This difference
   was reflected in a second analysis that showed greater frame-by-frame
   change in articulator positions for the mismatch than for the match
   condition around 300-500 ms before the onset of the picture name. Our
   findings indicate that comprehension-elicited prediction influences
   speech-motor production, suggesting that the speech production system is
   implicated in the representation of such predictions.}},

Title = {{Environmental noise and incident mental health problems: A prospective

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{143}},

Abstract = {{Background: Environmental noise is considered a threat to public health
   as 20\% of the EU population is exposed to health influencing noise
   levels. An association of noise and mental health problems in children
   has been suggested by some studies, but results are not consistent and
   there are no longitudinal studies of this association. Our aim was to
   investigate the influence of different environmental noise sources at
   children's homes on incident mental health problems in school-aged
   children.
   Method: A cohort study of children from first (t0) to fourth grade (t1)
   of primary school was conducted. Different environmental noise sources
   (day/night separately) at children's home were assessed via parental
   annoyance reports. Increased noise exposure between t0 and t1 was the
   exposure variable. Incident mental health problems were assessed with
   the parental version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire
   (SDQ). RRs and 95\% CIs were analysed to investigate the association
   between different noise sources and incident mental health problems.
   Results: The study population consisted of 583 boys and 602 girls. The
   most common increase in noise exposure between t0 and t1 was road
   traffic noise day (26.38\%). After adjusting for covariates exposure to
   road traffic night was significantly associated with the total
   difficulties score (RR= 2.06; 95\% CI=1.25-3.40), emotional symptoms
   (RR=1.69, 95\% CI=1.04-2.72), and conduct problems (RR=1,57, 95\%
   CI=1.04-2.38). Noise by neighbours during the day was associated with
   conduct problems (RR=1.62, 95\% CI=1.11-2.40) and hyperactivity
   (RR=1.69, 95\% CI=1.08-2.65). Aircraft noise day and construction work
   day were not associated with any of the SDQ categories at a significant
   level.
   Conclusion: Environmental noise is an important public health problem.
   This is the first study to investigate the association of a broad range
   of noise sources and incident mental health problems in children in a
   cohort study. Our results suggest that exposure to noise at children's
   home is associated with mental health problems such as emotional
   symptoms, conduct problems and hyperactivity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

   validated by analyzing binary meat mixtures with pork, ``all game{''}
   meat mixtures containing each of the four game species in pork and a

Abstract = {{The effect of 8.6 1017 n/cm2 fast neutron irradiation on the magnetic
   susceptibility and magnetoresistance of Si whiskers with impurity

   Neutron irradiated specimens with boron concentration away of MIT are
   mainly diamagnetic with a small amount of paramagnetic centers
   originated from dangling bonds on the whisker surface. It has been
   established that at temperatures near 4.2 K, a significant contribution
   to the conductivity is made by light charge carriers of low
   concentration but with high mobility. The as grown whiskers with
   impurity concentration correspondent to MIT showed hysteresis loops in
   magnetization at temperature of liquid helium. Besides hysteresis loops
   in magnetoresistance was observed for whiskers under compression stress
   at low temperature up to 7 K. The possible reason of the effect can be
   magnetic interaction between impurities centers in subsurface region of
   the whisker with the orbital moment of dangle bounds in the whisker
   core-shell interstices. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{In this letter, we develop a novel tensor-based receiver for two-hop
   cooperative multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay systems. At the
   source node, the proposed transmit signal design combines the linear
   constellation precoding with time-domain spreading. We show that the
   received signal at the destination node is formulated as a fourth-order
   tensor satisfying a nested parallel factor (PARAFAC) model, and then a
   new tensor-based receiver is derived by resorting to the proposed
   receiver algorithm. Under the assumption that channel state information
   (CSI) is not available at each node, the proposed receiver jointly
   estimates the channel parameters and transmitted symbols. Numerical
   results show that the proposed receiver outperforms some competing
   tensor-based receivers and operates close to the zero forcing (ZF)
   receiver with perfect CSI.}},

Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{1-11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is usually used to protect nanoparticles
   from rapid clearance in blood. The effects are highly dependent on the
   surface PEG density of nanoparticles. However, there lacks a detailed
   and informative study in PEG density and in vivo drug delivery due to
   the critical techniques to precisely control the surface PEG density
   when maintaining other nano-properties. Here, we regulated the polymeric
   nanoparticles' size and surface PEG density by incorporating
   poly(E-caprolactone) (PCL) homopolymer into poly(ethylene
   glycol)-block-poly(E-caprolactone) (PEG-PCL) and adjusting the mass
   ratio of PCL to PEG-PCL during the nanoparticles preparation. We further
   developed a library of polymeric nanoparticles with different but
   controllable sizes and surface PEG densities by changing the molecular
   weight of the PCL block in PEG-PCL and tuning the molar ratio of
   repeating units of PCL (CL) to that of PEG (EG). We thus obtained a
   group of nanoparticles with variable surface PEG densities but with
   other nano-properties identical, and investigated the effects of surface
   PEG densities on the biological behaviors of nanoparticles in mice. We
   found that, high surface PEG density made the nanoparticles resistant to
   absorption of serum protein and uptake by macrophages, leading to a
   greater accumulation of nanoparticles in tumor tissue, which recuperated
   the defects of decreased internalization by tumor cells, resulting in
   superior antitumor efficacy when carrying docetaxel. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Urinary bladder cancer is a worldwide concern because of its level of
   incidence and recurrence. To search an effective therapeutic strategy
   for urinary bladder cancer, it is important to identify proteins
   involved in tumorigenesis that could serve as potential targets for
   diagnosis and treatment. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPRs) constitute a
   large protein family of receptors that sense molecules outside the cell
   and activate signal transduction pathways and cellular responses inside
   the cell. GPR137 is a newly discovered human gene encoding orphan GPRs.
   In this study, we aimed to investigate the physiological role of GPR137
   in urinary bladder cancer. The effect of GPR137 on cell growth was
   examined via an RNA interference (RNAi) lentivirus system in two human
   urinary bladder cancer cell lines BT5637 and T24. Lentivirus-mediated
   RNAi could specifically suppressed GPR137 expression in vitro, resulting
   in alleviated cell viability and impaired colony formation, as well as
   blocks G0/G1 and S phases of the cell cycle. These results suggested
   GPR137 as an essential player in urinary bladder cancer cell growth, and
   it may serve as a potential target for gene therapy in the treatment of
   urinary bladder cancer. (C) 2014 International Union of Biochemistry and

Abstract = {{In order to study the effect of the frequency and the intensity of
   high-frequency alternating-current (AC) electric fields on lean
   combustion, the effects of high-frequency (5-30 kHz; 5 kV) and
   high-voltage (0-5 kV; 15 kHz) AC electric fields on lean (excess air
   ratio 1.2/1.4/1.6) premixed CH4/N-2/O-2 flames are evaluated
   experimentally in the paper in detail. Results show that the mean flame
   propagation speed increases with the electric field frequency at first.
   However, the transition frequency, after which the mean flame
   propagation speed reaches to the maximum and then tends to be
   stabilized, is shown to be around 25 kHz. The combustion peak pressure
   increases minimally at various frequencies, but the timing of it
   decreases apparently; additionally, the effect of frequency on the
   combustion pressure change is very close to that on the mean flame
   propagation speed. The initial duration and main duration also have a
   similar tendency with the increase of the frequency. Besides, with the
   increase of the applied voltage, the mean flame propagation speed
   increases nearly exponentially. Meanwhile, the combustion peak pressure
   increases, and the timing of it decreases. Similarly, the effect of
   applied voltage on the combustion pressure change is also close to that
   on the mean flame propagation speed, and the initial duration and main
   duration also declines with the increase of the applied voltage. The
   result shows that the combustion of lean mixtures can be enhanced
   effectively by high-frequency (5-30 kHz) and high-voltage (1-5 kV) AC
   electric fields, which has a positive meaning in the further study of
   the electric-field-assisted combustion theory.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical and empirical accounts highlight the link between shame and
   body image difficulties, and disordered eating behaviours. Specifically,
   body image shame seems to play a particularly important role in this
   association. The current study aimed at developing and validating a new
   measure of body image shame and its phenomenology, the Body Image Shame
   Scale (BISS). Distinct samples of women from the general and student
   populations were used to test the BISS factorial structure using
   principal component analysis (PCA) and confirmatory factor analysis
   (CFA), and to examine the psychometric properties of the BISS. Principal
   component analysis results indicated that the scale presents a
   two-factor structure assessing an externalized and an internalized
   dimension underlying body image shame, which explains a total of 62.41\%
   of the variance. A confirmatory factor analysis further corroborated the
   adequacy of this structure, which revealed good global and local
   adjustment indices. The BISS also presented very good internal
   consistency, construct and discriminant validities and good test-retest
   reliability. The scale also showed good concurrent and divergent
   validities. Furthermore, the scale discriminates between women with
   higher or lower levels of disordered eating behaviours. Finally, a
   mediation analysis revealed that the BISS fully mediates the previously
   established association between external shame and eating
   psychopathology. The BISS is a psychometrically robust and short measure
   of body image shame and its external and internal dimensions. Copyright

Abstract = {{Background: Plasticity of the primary motor cortex (M1) has a critical
   role in motor control and learning. The cerebellum facilitates these
   functions using sensory feedback.
   Objective: We investigated how cerebellar degeneration influences the
   plasticity of the M1 by using PAS (paired associative stimulation)
   technique. PAS involves repeated pairs of electrical stimuli to the
   median nerve and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor
   cortex. If the interval between peripheral and TMS stimulation is around
   21-25 ms, corticospinal excitability is increased via a long term
   potentiation (LTP)-like effect within M1. Our aims were: (i) to explore
   the presence of a time-specific influence of cerebellar degeneration on
   human associative plasticity; (ii) to evaluate the role played by
   somatosensory pathway on cerebellar modulation of sensory-motor
   plasticity.
   Methods: We studied 10 patients with pure cerebellar atrophy and 10
   age-matched healthy subjects. Motor-evoked-potentials amplitudes,
   short-afferent inhibition (SAI), motor thresholds, I/O curves,
   somatosensory-evoked-potential (SEP) were measured before, just after
   and 30 min after PAS at ISIs (interstimulus intervals) of 21.5 and 25
   ms.
   Results: Cerebellar patients show a selective lack of LTP-like effect
   induced by PAS25 ms, but not at 21.5 ms. SAI was overall not truly
   modulated by PAS but clearly differed between cerebellar patients and
   healthy subjects for ISIs around 25 ms (+6 ms and +8 ms) (P < 0.01).
   SEPs showed the amplitude of P25 wave was markedly reduced in patients
   with a more severe clinical and radiological impairment of cerebellum.
   Conclusions: Cerebellar patients have an altered capability of
   cerebellar filtering or processing of time-specific incoming sensory
   volleys, influencing the plasticity of M1. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{We develop a mechanical model of tight clusters of coplanar seismic
   asperities, to investigate a particular microearthquake swarm located at
   8 km depth in the Corinth rift in Greece, which was active between 2001
   and 2007. Although it is classified as a multiplet based on waveform
   similarity, this seismic sequence is much more complex than a repeating
   earthquake sequence and cannot be interpreted as the regular failure of
   a single asperity forced by surrounding aseismic creep. Here we suggest
   that such complex sequences could be generated by the failure of a set
   of coplanar asperities interacting in a small region of a fault segment.
   We show that in order to reproduce the dynamics of the observed sequence
   and the characteristics of the events, the cluster of asperities has to
   be located very close to an aseismically slipping fault segment, which
   could be an updip extension of the deep detachment zone in the rift,
   creeping at 1.5 cm/yr. For more general cases of coplanar clustered
   asperities, we show that the shape of the cumulative coseismic
   displacement pattern associated with the repeated failures of the
   asperities is strongly controlled by the behavior of the fault area
   surrounding the asperity cluster. In particular, if the cluster is part
   of a locked fault area, the resulting long-term cumulative displacement
   is maximum at the center of the cluster. In contrast, an asperity
   cluster surrounded by aseismic creep leads to a uniform cumulative
   coseismic slip pattern. The ratio between cumulative slip at the center
   of the seismogenic patch and cumulative slip at its periphery could
   therefore be an indicator of the mechanical conditions prevailing on the
   fault. A systematic study of the source parameters of complex
   microseismic sequences could therefore provide insights into the
   mechanical state of active faults continuously generating
   microseismicity.}},

Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{This article explores recent outbreaks of protest and violence against
   asylum-seekers in Israel. I posit that while existing approaches to
   anti-immigrant mobilization that primarily emphasize material and
   cultural forms of inter-group competition offer important explanatory
   foundations, they are insufficient to account fully for these outcomes.
   Instead, I argue that Israel's explicit interests vis-A -vis recent
   influxes of asylum-seekers, namely, forestalling long-term settlement
   and avoiding the liberalization of its asylum regime, generated two
   mechanisms that ultimately sparked xenophobic mobilization. First,
   center-right politicians disseminated and progressively intensified
   exclusionary discourses and legal practices as a means of mobilizing
   popular support for exclusion and delegitimizing asylum claims. These
   practices problematized asylum-seekers' presence through their
   construction as security, demographic, and economic threats, and
   generated increasing societal concerns. Second, a concurrent `hands off'
   approach excluded asylum-seekers from access to state services, denying
   them material and social support while limiting their access to the
   labor market. This approach occasioned multiple adverse consequences for
   both asylum-seekers and host communities, and prompted perceptions of
   state incapacity to implement its own exclusionary policies. The
   analysis suggests that the interaction between these two mechanisms,
   coupled with concurrent legal constraints on long-term incarceration and
   repatriation, furnished the motive, opportunity, and legitimacy for
   anti-asylum-seeker mobilization.}},

Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{In this study, elastic scattering was employed to investigate diesel
   fuel property effects on the liquid length (i.e., the maximum extent of
   in-cylinder liquid-phase fuel penetration) using select research fuels:
   an ultralow-sulfur \#2 diesel emissions-certification fuel (CF) and four
   of the Coordinating Research Council (CRC) Fuels for Advanced Combustion
   Engines (FACE) diesel fuels (F1, F2, F6, and F8). The experiments were
   performed in a single-cylinder heavy-duty optical compression-ignition
   engine under time-varying, noncombusting conditions to minimize the
   influence of chemical heat release on the liquid-length measurement. The
   FACE diesel fuel and CF liquid lengths under combusting conditions were
   also predicted using Siebers scaling law and pressure data from previous
   work using the same fuels at similar in-cylinder conditions. The
   objective was to observe if the liquid length under noncombusting or
   combusting conditions provides additional insights into the
   relationships among the main fuel properties (i.e., cetane number (CN),
   the 90 vol \% distillation recovery temperature (T90), and aromatic
   content) and smoke emissions. Results suggest that liquid-length values
   are best correlated to fuel distillation characteristics measured with
   ASTM D2887 (simulated distillation method). This work also studied the
   relationship between liquid length and lift-off length, H (i.e.,
   distance from the fuel-injector orifice exit to the position where the
   standing premixed autoignition zone stabilizes during mixing-controlled
   combustion). Two possible cases were identified based on the relative
   magnitudes of liquid length under combusting conditions (L-c) and H. The
   low-CN fuels are representative of the first case, L-c < H, in which the
   fuel is always fully vaporized at H. The high-CN fuels are mostly
   representative of the second case, L-c >= H, in which there is still
   liquid fuel at H. L-c >= H would suggest higher smoke emissions, but
   there is not enough evidence in this work to support a compounding
   effect of a longer liquid length on top of the aromatic-content effect
   on smoke emissions for fuels with similar CN, supporting previous
   findings in the literature that lift-off length plays a more important
   role than liquid-length on diesel combustion. At the same time, the
   experimental results suggest a decrease in the fuel-jet spreading angle,
   i.e., a decrease in the entrainment rate into the jet at and downstream
   of H, under combusting conditions, that is not accounted for in the
   model used to predict the values of phi(H). As a result, L-c may be of
   interest for accurate predictions of phi(H), especially for combustion
   strategies designed to lower in-cylinder soot by operating near or below
   the nonsooting phi(H)-value (i.e., phi(H)approximate to 2).}},

Abstract = {{Policy makers aim to avoid banking crises, and although they can to some
   extent control domestic conditions, internationally transmitted crises
   are difficult to tackle. This paper identifies international contagion
   in banking during the 2007-2009 crisis for 54 economies. We identify
   three channels of contagion - systematic, idiosyncratic and volatility -
   and find evidence for these in 45 countries. Banking crises are
   overwhelmingly associated with the presence of both systematic and
   idiosyncratic contagion. The results reveal that crisis shocks
   transmitted from a foreign jurisdiction via idiosyncratic contagion
   increase the likelihood of a systemic crisis in the domestic banking
   system by almost 37 percent, whereas increased exposure via systematic
   contagion does not necessarily destabilize the domestic banking system.
   Thus while policy makers and regulatory authorities are rightly
   concerned with the systematic transmission of banking crises, reducing
   the potential for idiosyncratic contagion can importantly reduce the
   consequences for the domestic economy. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published

   resulting in RABV-Delta M-Env. Infectious virus was recovered following
   standard methods and propagated on baby hamster kidney cells stably
   expressing RABV M {[}>10(7) focus forming units (ffu)/ml]. Western blot
   analysis of cell lysates or of purified virions confirmed Env expression
   on the surface of infected cells and within virus particles,
   respectively. Positive neutralization activity against a
   neutralization-sensitive SIV strain and to a lesser extent against a
   neutralization-resistant SIV strain was detected in mice after a single
   intramuscular inoculation with RABV-Delta M-Env. The quality, but not
   quantity, of the antibody response was enhanced via boosting with
   recombinant gp130 or RABV-Delta M-Env as measured by an increase in
   antibody avidity and a skewing toward a Th1-type antibody response. We
   also show that an intradermal inoculation induces higher antibodies than
   an intramuscular or intranasal inoculation. An intradermal inoculation
   of RABV-Delta M-Env followed by a boost inoculation with recombinant
   gp130 produced anti-SIV antibodies with neutralizing and nonneutralizing
   antibody (nNAb) effector functions. Together, RABV-Delta M-Env induces B
   cells to secrete antibodies against SIV with the potential to clear both
   ``free{''} and cell-associated virus. Strategies capable of eliciting
   both NAbs as well as nNAbs might help to improve the efficacy of HIV-1
   vaccines.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes Oudjat, a new software program which has been
   developed in order to conduct recognition experiments. Oudjat is
   dedicated to the manual annotation facial expressions of emotion (FEE).
   Considering the existence of other software applications in that field,
   Oudjat provides a compromise solution between the currently existing
   tools. For the investigators, it is an easy-to-configure interface to
   set up relevant behaviors to be annotated. For the annotators, it is an
   easy-to-use interface. This tool can perform complex annotations
   procedures utilizing multiple responses panels such as buttons, scales
   (e.g., Likert scales), and free labelling. Oudjat also allows to chain
   response panels or to conduct sequence marking annotations (i.e.,
   two-steps temporal annotation). As it can be configured in any language,
   Oudjat is particularly suited for intercultural experiments. Four
   annotation procedures are presented to illustrate Oudjat's possibilities
   with FEE annotation. Oudjat is an open source software available to the
   scientific community, and can be freely be obtained on request. (C) 2015

Pages = {{1537-1547}},

Abstract = {{Why do females faced with the same array of potential mates often select
   different males? Variation in choosiness, defined as investment in mate
   search, is an important potential source of variation in mating
   decisions. Experimental work suggests such variation is driven by the
   costs of searching, but data from natural populations are scarce and few
   studies have addressed explicitly the counteracting benefits expected
   from search investment. We tracked male visitation behavior of
   free-ranging females on a lek of lance-tailed manakins (Chiroxiphia
   lanceolata) using automated telemetry at dispersed male display sites.
   We assessed relationships of female age, experience, body condition, and
   parasite load with variation in choosiness, quantified as males visited,
   number of visits, and visit duration. Young females visited more males
   and made more total visits before choosing a mate, whereas older females
   conducted longer visits for first nests of the year. Renesting females
   searched less, but the few monitored females mating faithfully between
   years nevertheless sampled several males. We found little support for
   effects of condition on choosiness. Results suggest females sample more
   widely when they lack information about the distribution of available
   mates. Though previous work in the study population has shown both
   female preference for and offspring fitness benefits from heterozygous
   sires, genetic tests of paternity revealed choosier females did not
   choose more heterozygous mates. Females' investment in mate search
   varied in relation to their own age and within-year experience, but mate
   search investment did not independently determine variation in choice
   among individuals.}},

Title = {{Studies of the correlation between mercury content and the content of
   various forms of sulfur in Polish hard coals}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{159}},
Pages = {{206-213}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Similarities concerning the occurrence of mercury and sulfur in coal are
   the reasons for studying the correlation between mercury content and the
   content of the various forms of sulfur such as: total sulfur, pyritic
   sulfur, sulfate sulfur, and organic sulfur. For this purpose a wide
   range of different coals and rejects were used. Selected samples
   differed significantly in the content of ash, mercury, sulfur and its
   various forms. In the examinations, both steam and coking coals were
   studied. For coking coals, samples of raw coals, clean coals, middling
   products and rejects derived from coal preparation plants were examined.
   To verify the correlation a statistical analysis was performed. The
   Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and the correlation coefficients
   R for polynomial functions of degree 1 and 2 were determined.
   Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded, that mercury occurs
   in Polish hard coals both in the organic matter and the inorganic
   constituents. For the organic matter a significant correlation between
   the content of mercury and the content of total sulfur and organic
   sulfur was obtained for subset of examined samples characterized by a
   relatively low ash yield (clean coals derived from the coal cleaning
   process). In the case of the inorganic constituents a significant
   correlation between the content of mercury and the content of pyritic
   sulfur was obtained for the examined subset of samples characterized by
   a very high ash yield (rejects derived from the coal cleaning process).
   An analysis of the subsets of samples derived from individual mines
   showed that the modes of occurrence of mercury in coal were different
   for various Polish mines. These differences may be explained by the
   genetic diversity of coal i.e. various diagenetic, coalification and
   post-diagenetic conditions, including such phenomena as mineralization
   that post-dates coal formation and magmatic intrusion, etc.
   In order to explain the mercury and sulfur behavior in the analyzed
   processes of coal cleaning the percentage share of those elements in
   rejects in relation to raw coal was also determined. The mercury removal
   efficiencies recorded for the cleaning process of Polish hard coals
   ranged from about 33\% to as much as 67\%.
   Results of the statistical analyses did not, however, provide necessary
   evidence allowing for the formulation of final conclusions regarding the
   modes of occurrence of mercury in Polish coals, its association with
   sulfur present in coal as well as proportioning of mercury in the
   processes of coal cleaning. The results did make it possible, though, to
   identify the major scientific problems, which, if solved by relevant
   methods (e.g. XRD, SEM, EPMA), will facilitate the understanding of the
   Hg-modes of occurrence in various Polish hard coals. The results of the
   statistical analyses will also make it easier to appropriately select
   samples in order to explain these scientific problems. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   (LaAlO3)(0.3)(Sr2AlTaO6)(0.7) (001) substrates using hybrid molecular
   beam epitaxy. This growth approach employs a conventional effusion cell
   to supply elemental A-site Sr and the metalorganic precursor vanadium
   oxytriisopropoxide (VTIP) to supply vanadium. Oxygen is supplied in its
   molecular form through a gas inlet. An optimal VTIP: Sr flux ratio has
   been identified using reflection high-energy electron-diffraction, x-ray
   diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and scanning transmission electron
   microscopy, demonstrating stoichiometric SrVO3 films with atomically
   flat surface morphology. Away from the optimal VTIP: Sr flux,
   characteristic changes in the crystalline structure and surface
   morphology of the films were found, enabling identification of the type
   of nonstoichiometry. For optimal VTIP: Sr flux ratios, high quality
   SrVO3 thin films were obtained with smallest deviation of the lattice
   parameter from the ideal value and with atomically smooth surfaces,
   indicative of the good cation stoichiometry achieved by this growth
   technique. (C) 2015 American Vacuum Society.}},

Abstract = {{Arabesque greenling in rigor state was used in this study. Meat from the
   fish was ground with 3 \% NaCl and incubated at 25 A degrees C.
   Significant myosin cross-linking and monodansylcadaverine incorporation
   into myosin heavy chains were both observed. These events were easily
   lost upon storage of the fish for a few days at 5 A degrees C,
   indicating a quick inactivation of transglutaminase (TGase) during the
   storage. Crude TGase extracted from the meat of fish in rigor state also
   lost the activity upon its storage at 5 A degrees C. The loss of
   activity seemed not due to degradation of the enzyme by endogenous
   proteinases from an inhibitor addition test. Storage of fish meat with
   sorbitol suppressed TGase inactivation during the storage. A similar
   stabilizing effect of sorbitol on the enzyme was confirmed with crude
   enzyme. AG meat from the fish in rigor state showed a setting effect
   with a clear increase in the breaking force and strain upon preheating
   at 25 A degrees C. Such setting effect was not detectable for commercial
   AG surimi. Thus, it was suggested that no setting effect found with
   commercial AG surimi is due to significantly decreased TGase activity in
   it.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, novel electrochemical biosensors for Ag+ determination
   based on Ag+-induced DNA hybridization, using Ethyl green (EG) as an
   electroactive label on the surface of bare carbon paste electrode (CPE)
   and gold nanoparticles-modified carbon paste electrode (GN-CPE) are
   reported. Two single-strand poly-C (100\% cytosine bases) DNAs are used
   as oligonucleotide probe and target. In the presence of Ag+, the target
   DNA with full cytosine-cytosine (C-C) mismatches could hybridize with
   the probe DNA by forming C-Ag+-C complex. The induced hybridization of
   the two oligonucleotides leads to the decrease in the reduction peak
   currents of EG, which could be used for electrochemical determination of
   Ag+. This difference in the values of the reduction peak current of EG
   before and after DNA hybridization (Al) was linear with the
   concentration of Ag+ in the ranges froth 3.0 x 10(-19) to 1.0 x 10(-9)
   mol L-1 and 9.0 x 10(-11) to 1.0 x 10(-9) mol L-1, for the biosensor and
   nanoparticles modified-biosensor, respectively. Calculated detection
   limits were 1.04 x 10(-19) and 2.64 x 10(-11) mol L-1 for biosensor and
   nanoparticles modified-biosensor, respectively. The biosensors
   demonstrated good selectivity towards Ag+ ions in the presence of some
   metal ions such as Pb2+, Cu2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, Fe2+ and Hg. The proposed
   biosensors were applied successfully to the voltammetric determination
   of Ag+ in real samples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The T-cell/transmembrane, mucin and immunoglobulin domain protein 1
   (TIM-1) is a phosphatidlyserine (PtdSer) receptor and a T-cell
   costimulatory molecule linked to the development of atopic diseases.
   TIM-1 locates preferentially in intracellular compartments. Here we show
   that in human and mouse lymphoid cells, TIM-1 localizes in different
   types of endosomes and that its domain structure is important for
   protein sorting to intracellular vesicles. The BALB/c mouse TIM-1
   protein, which has a longer mucin domain, is sorted more efficiently to
   endosomes than the shorter C57BL/6 variant. High affinity ligands such
   as PtdSer increase the amount of cell surface TIM-1; the protein also
   polarizes toward cell contacts with apoptotic cells. The large pool of
   intracellular TIM-1 translocates to the immune synapse (IS) with the
   CD3-TCR (T-cell receptor) complex and colocalizes to the central
   supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC). In contrast, cell surface
   TIM-1 does not traffic to the IS, but is located away from it. The
   bipolar TIM-1 sorting observed during IS formation is determined by
   differences in its subcellular location, and might modulate
   antigen-driven immune responses.}},

Abstract = {{Background and ObjectivesWhen performed at select centers, minimally
   invasive gastrectomy (MIG) for gastric adenocarcinoma is associated with
   reduced perioperative morbidity, and similar oncologic outcomes as
   compared to open gastrectomy (OG). Utilization of, and outcomes
   associated with, MIG in the United States have not been characterized.
   MethodsThe National Cancer Database (2010-2011) was queried for AJCC
   pStage IB-IIIC patients who underwent curative-intent OG (n=2,303) or
   MIG (n=331). Multivariable models identified factors associated with MIG
   utilization, R0 resection rates, and adequate lymph node staging (LNS).
   ResultsMIG was more frequently utilized for T1/T2 (P<0.001), N0
   (P=0.022), and stage IB (P=0.001) tumors. MIG was associated with
   shorter hospital stay (P<0.001), equivalent lymph node examination
   (P=0.337) and superior rates of R0 resection (P=0.011) compared with OG.
   In patients undergoing MIG, R0 resection was associated with performance
   of near-total/total gastrectomy (OR 3.90, 95\%CI 1.10-13.9) and tumors
   <5cm (OR 2.78, 95\%CI 1.07-7.26). Adequate LNS was associated with
   surgery at academic (OR 1.99, 95\%CI 1.19-3.32) or high-volume
   facilities (OR 2.97, 95\%CI 1.59-5.54), tumor size 5cm (OR 1.85, 95\%CI
   1.10-3.11), and node positivity (OR 1.75, 95\%CI 1.04-2.93).
   ConclusionsMIG is selectively utilized in cases with favorable tumor
   characteristics. In such cases, short-term oncologic outcomes are
   equivalent to those achieved with OG. Worse oncologic outcomes in
   specific subgroups underscore opportunities for quality improvement. J.

Abstract = {{Aims: Global health education is increasingly acknowledged as an
   opportunity for medical schools to prepare future practitioners for the
   broad health challenges of our time. The purpose of this study was to
   describe the evolution of global health education in Swedish medical
   schools and to assess students' perceived needs for such education.
   Methods:Data on global health education were collected from all medical
   faculties in Sweden for the years 2000-2013. In addition, 76\% (439/577)
   of all Swedish medical students in their final semester answered a
   structured questionnaire. Results: Global health education is offered at
   four of Sweden's seven medical schools, and most medical students have
   had no global health education. Medical students in their final semester
   consider themselves to lack knowledge and skills in areas such as the
   global burden of disease (51\%), social determinants of health (52\%),
   culture and health (60\%), climate and health (62\%), health promotion
   and disease prevention (66\%), strategies for equal access to health
   care (69\%) and global health care systems (72\%). A significant
   association was found between self-assessed competence and the amount of
   global health education received (p<0.001). A majority of Swedish
   medical students (83\%) wished to have more global health education
   added to the curriculum. Conclusions: Most Swedish medical students have
   had no global health education as part of their medical school
   curriculum. Expanded education in global health is sought after by
   medical students and could strengthen the professional development of
   future medical doctors in a wide range of topics important for
   practitioners in the global world of the twenty-first century.}},

Abstract = {{The niche concept of stem cell biology proposes a functional unit
   between the precursor cells and their local microenvironment, to which
   several cell types might contribute by cell-cell contacts, extracellular
   matrix, and humoral factors. We here established three co-culture models
   (with cell types separated by membrane) for both adherent monolayers and
   neurospheres to address the potential influence of different niche cell
   types in the neurogenic zone of the adult hippocampus of mice.
   Astrocytes and endothelial cells enhanced precursor cell proliferation
   and neurosphere formation. Endothelial factors also led to a prolonged
   increase in proliferation after growth factor withdrawal, which
   otherwise induces differentiation. All niche cell types enhanced cell
   survival in monolayer cultures, endothelial cells also stimulated
   neuronal differentiation. A parallel trend elicited by astrocytes did
   not reach conventional statistical significance. Pericytes had variable
   effects here. We did not observe changes in differentiation in
   neurosphere co-cultures. In summary, our data indicate that in precursor
   cell culture protocols survival could be improved by adding as yet
   unknown factors physiologically contributed by astrocytes and
   endothelial cells. Our findings also underscore the complexity of the
   niche and the differential impact of factors from the different sources
   on distinct aspects of neuronal development. With the help of the models
   presented here, identification of these factors and their specific
   biological activity can now be initiated. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Children with hemophilia usually have recurrent joint bleeding that
   leads to joint damage, loss of range of motion, and restriction of
   mobility, therefore affecting the quality of life in these children. The
   purpose of this study was to compare the effects of low-level laser
   therapy (LLLT) to that of pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) in
   treatment of hemarthrosis in children with hemophilia. Thirty boys with
   hemophilia A with ages ranging from 9 to 13 years were selected and
   assigned randomly, using sealed envelopes, into two equal intervention
   groups. The study group I received the traditional physical therapy
   program in addition to LLLT, whereas the study group II received the
   same physical therapy program given to the study group I in addition to
   PEMF. Both groups received the treatment sessions three times per week
   for three successive months. Pain, laboratory investigations, swelling,
   and range of motion (ROM) of the affected knee joint, in addition to
   physical fitness were evaluated before, at the end of the sixth week and
   at 12 weeks of the treatment program. Laser group showed significant
   improvement in all measured variables after the sixth week of treatment
   when compared with PEMF. By 12 weeks of treatment, there was a
   significant improvement in pain, ROM, ESR and leucocytes levels in laser
   group compared with PEMF, while there was no significant difference in
   knee circumferences and the 6-min walk test (6MWT) between both groups.
   Both groups showed significant improvement at 12 weeks of treatment
   compared with that at 6 weeks. Both LLLT and PEMF are effective
   modalities in reducing pain, swelling, increasing ROM and improving
   physical fitness. Twelve weeks of treatment of both modalities
   demonstrated significant improvement than 6 weeks of treatment. Laser
   therapy induced significant improvement than electromagnetic therapy in
   treatment of hemarthrosis-related problems in children with hemophilia.}},

Abstract = {{Repetitive and restrictive behaviors are disruptive in children with
   autism spectrum disorder. Exposure is an evidence-based approach to
   these problems and is hypothesized to work in part by enabling rule
   testing that undermines rule control. The present study undermined rule
   control more directly through cognitive defusion exercises. Experiment 1
   used a multiple baseline across participants design to assess the
   effects of a cognitive defusion exercise in the form of word repetition
   and exposure on problem behavior associated with repetitive and
   restrictive behaviors observed in children with autism spectrum
   disorder. All 3 participants demonstrated a decrease in the percentage
   of problem behavior following the implementation of treatment which
   remained at near zero during a 3-month follow-up. Experiment 2 used an
   alternating treatments design to compare a cognitive defusion exercise
   and exposure to a control exercise and exposure. All except 1 of the
   participants displayed larger and quicker decreases in problem behavior
   during the cognitive defusion exercise condition compared to the control
   exercise condition. The results suggest that cognitive defusion
   exercises can enhance the treatment effects of exposure to decrease
   problem behavior associated with repetitive and restrictive behaviors.

Abstract = {{Two simple, accurate, and precise chromatographic methods have been
   developed and validated for the determination of dronedarone (DRO) HCl
   and amiodarone (AMI) HCl either alone or in binary mixtures due to the
   possibility of using AMI as a counterfeit of DRO because of its lower
   price. First, an RP-HPLC method is described for the simultaneous
   determination of DRO and AMI. Chromatographic separation was achieved on
   a BDS Hypersil C18 column (150 x 4.6 mm, 5 pm). Isocratic elution based
   on potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffer with 0.1\% triethylamine pH 6
   methanol (10 + 90, v/v) at a flow rate of 2 mL/min with UV detection at
   254 nm was performed. The second method is RP ultra-HPLC in which the
   chromatographic separation was achieved on an Acclaim (TM) RSLC 120 C18
   column (100 x 2.1 mm, 2.2 pm) using isocratic elution with potassium
   dihydrogen phosphate buffer with 0.1\% triethylamine pH 6 methanol (5 +
   95, v/v) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min with UV detection at 254 nm.
   Linearity, accuracy, and precision of the two methods were found to be
   acceptable over the concentration ranges of 5-80 mu g/mL for both DRO
   and AMI. The results were statistically compared using one-way analysis
   of variance. The optimized methods were validated and proved to be
   specific, robust, precise, and accurate for the QC of the drugs in their
   pharmaceutical preparations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental investigation of adsorption
   equilibrium characteristics of natural gas onto granular activated
   carbon (GAC). Experiments have been conducted at adsorption temperatures
   ranging from 20 degrees C to 50 degrees C and pressures up to 10 bar.
   The measurements are based on measuring the adsorption uptake difference
   between two equilibrium adsorption states. Experimental data have been
   correlated using four adsorption isotherm models, namely, Langmuir,
   Toth, Dubinin-Astakhov (D-A), with and without volume correction. The
   proposed method reduces the time required to conduct the experiments
   significantly. It is found that 1 kg of GAC can adsorb about 77 g of
   natural gas at adsorption temperature of 20 degrees C and equilibrium
   pressure of 10 bar. Isosteric heat of adsorption of natural gas/GAC pair
   has been estimated using Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Comparison between
   storage capacities of adsorbed natural gas and compressed natural gas
   has also been discussed. Results extracted from the present study are
   useful for developing efficient adsorbed natural gas storage systems.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Salvinorin-A is a terpene with agonist properties at the
   kappa-opioid receptor, the binding site of endogenous dynorphins.
   Salvinorin-A is found in Salvia divinorum, a psychoactive plant
   traditionally used by the Mazatec people of Oaxaca, Mexico, for
   medicinal and spiritual purposes. Previous studies with the plant and
   salvinorin-A have reported psychedeliclike changes in perception, but
   also unusual changes in body awareness and detachment from external
   reality. Here we comprehensively studied the profiles of subjective
   effects of increasing doses of salvinorin-A in healthy volunteers, with
   a special emphasis on interoception.
   Methods: A placebo and three increasing doses of vaporized salvinorin-A
   (0.25, 0.50, and 1 mg) were administered to eight healthy volunteers
   with previous experience in the use of psychedelics. Drug effects were
   assessed using a battery of questionnaires that included, among others,
   the Hallucinogen Rating Scale, the Altered States of Consciousness, and
   a new instrument that evaluates different aspects of body awareness: the
   Multidimensional Assessment for Interoceptive Awareness.
   Results: Salvinorin-A led to a disconnection from external reality,
   induced elaborate visions and auditory phenomena, and modified
   interoception. The lower doses increased somatic sensations, but the
   highest dose led to a sense of a complete loss of contact with the body.
   Conclusions: Salvinorin-A induced intense psychotropic effects
   characterized by a dose-dependent gating of external audiovisual
   information and an inverted-U dose-response effect on body awareness.
   These results suggest a prominent role for the kappa opioid receptor in
   the regulation of sensory perception, interoception, and the sense of
   body ownership in humans.}},

Abstract = {{Social theories of giving have often been shaped by anthropological
   accounts that present it as a form of pre-market reciprocal exchange,
   yet this exchangist discourse obscures important contemporary giving
   practices. This article discusses two types of giving that confound the
   exchangist model: (1) sharing practices within the family; and (2) free
   gifts to strangers. Once we reject understandings of giving derived from
   analyses of non-modern economies, it is possible to see that the gift
   economy is not a rare survival but rather is a central element of
   contemporary society and indeed the contemporary economy. The task for
   social theory is not to anachronize giving but to make sense of the
   variety and complexity of actual contemporary giving practices. This
   article offers the categories of free and positional gifts as a
   contribution to this analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the computation of a superset of the implicit support,
   implicitization of a parametrically given hypersurface is reduced to
   computing the nullspace of a numeric matrix. Our approach predicts the
   Newton polytope of the implicit equation by exploiting the sparseness of
   the given parametric equations and of the implicit polynomial, without
   being affected by the presence of any base points. In this work, we
   study how this interpolation matrix expresses the implicit equation as a
   matrix determinant, which is useful for certain operations such as ray
   shooting, and how it can be used to reduce some key geometric predicates
   on the hypersurface, namely membership and sidedness for given query
   points, to simple numerical operations on the matrix, without need to
   develop the implicit equation. We illustrate our results with examples
   based on our Maple implementation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Journal = {{IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING LETTERS}},

Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Four characteristic points of pulse pressure waves-the systolic peak,
   the anacrotic notch, the dicrotic notch, and the diastolic foot-are used
   to estimate various aspects of cardiovascular function, such as heart
   rate and augmentation index. We propose a novel approach to extracting
   these characteristic points using a topological signal processing
   framework. We characterize the topology of the signals using a
   collection of persistence intervals, which are encapsulated in a
   persistence diagram. The characteristic points are identified based on
   their time of occurrence and their distance from the identity line in
   the persistence diagram. We validate this approach by collecting radial
   pulse pressure data from twenty-eight participants using a wearable
   tonometer, and computing the peripheral augmentation index using a
   traditional derivative-based method and our novel persistence-based
   method. The augmentation index values computed using the two methods are
   statistically indistinguishable, suggesting that this representation
   merits further exploration as a tool for analyzing pulse pressure waves.}},

   the first confirmed case of spondylodiscitis with epidural abscess

   back and anterior left thigh. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed
   tomography detected the affected lesion at the L2 and L3 vertebral
   bodies. All isolates from the surgical and needle biopsy specimens were
   identified as P. micra by 16S rRNA and MALDI-TOF. In this case, P. micra
   showed high sensitivity to antimicrobial therapy. She was successfully
   treated with debridement and sulbactam/ampicillin, followed by oral
   metronidazole for a total of 10 weeks. The causative microorganisms of
   spondylodiscitis are not often identified, especially anaerobic bacteria
   tend to be underestimated. On the other hand, antimicrobial therapy for
   spondylodiscitis is usually prolonged. Accordingly, we emphasize the
   importance of performing accurate identification including anaerobic
   bacteria. (C) 2015, Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese

Abstract = {{Keeping constant all agronomic factors except temperature is a way to
   follow Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) expression. Three different sunflower
   hybrids derived from the cross between an inbred line, Cms HA 89, and
   three different restorer inbred lines, with resistance, susceptible, and
   normal reactions to drought, were produced. In order to investigate the
   impact of temperature on protein accumulation during achene filling
   phase, they were cultivated in two different geographical areas: Karaj
   in Iran and Udine in Italy. Total protein content and structural
   polypeptide fractions of Seed Storage Proteins (SSPs) were determined.
   The analysis of HSPs was carried out by means of lab-on-chip capillary
   electrophoresis. It was revealed that protein accumulation in achene
   occurs at a greater rate during the achene filling phase, i.e.
   approximately 9-25 days after pollination, in all examined hybrids.
   Besides, the presence of a polypeptide band of 17.7 kDa supposed to be
   of small Heat Shock Proteins (sHSPs) family was recorded in all three
   hybrids grown up in hot and arid environment, Karaj, which implied
   independent sHSPs expression from the paternal restorer line.}},

   will analyze their predictions in view of the experimental observations.
   Although none of the proposed detection models is able to describe all

Abstract = {{The demanding working and training conditions of psychotherapists in
   training (PiA) are discussed more and more frequently from social and
   research perspectives. The complementary focus on job and training
   pressure and its consequences have received little attention so far.
   The nationwide survey (N = 464) contains information on essential
   person-related and training-related risk factors and resources.
   Moreover, the study provides comparisons concerning different
   professional categories with high psychological and social demands as
   well as with the training conditions of psychotherapists in 2009.
   The study shows the difficulties and demanding situation of financing
   the training. The PiAs showed significantly higher stress levels than
   other groups of persons and comparably low resilience combined with a
   high working engagement. Only a few PiAs had a healthy behavioral and
   perceptional work pattern.
   The results underline the necessity for an examination of the training
   and working conditions of PiAs. Accordingly, options for interventions
   are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The United Nations Security Council is the primary international body in
   charge of upholding international peace and security. Permanent and
   nonpermanent member states share in the responsibility to avert great
   power conflicts and thwart asymmetric disputes, regional instability and
   civil war, but the former task has priority and the prerogatives and
   therefore the obligations of the five permanent member states widely
   exceed those of countries that hold two-year elected seats. The
   bifurcation of roles nevertheless produces `responsibility shirking',
   which weakens Council performance on the latter type of tasks. This
   article suggests that responsibility shirking is underreported in the
   literature even though it is well known to diplomatic practitioners. It
   considers three types of remedies to the situation, arguing that
   amendments to the UN Charter or the Provisional Rules of Procedure are
   unlikely, but that piecemeal and pragmatic reform could precipitate a
   change of mindset. In particular, allowing nonpermanent member states to
   co-chair the drafting of resolutions is likely to engage all member
   states in the core business of the Council.}},

Abstract = {{Cocaine and anabolic-androgenic steroids are substances commonly

   administration on cocaine-induced locomotor activity in adult and
   adolescent rats. Rats received ten once-daily subcutaneous (s.c.)
   injections of testosterone (10 mg/kg) or vehicle. Three days after the
   last testosterone or vehicle injections rats received an intraperitoneal
   (i.p.) challenge injection of either saline or cocaine (10 mg/kg). A
   different subset of rats was treated with a single injection of
   testosterone (10 mg/kg) or vehicle and three days later was challenged
   with cocaine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline. Immediately after cocaine or
   saline injections the locomotor activity was recorded during forty
   minutes. Our results demonstrated that repeated testosterone induced
   locomotor sensitization to cocaine in adolescent but not adult rats. (C)

   Meta-analysis}},

Volume = {{136}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Disruptive behavior disorders are among the most common
   child and adolescent psychiatric disorders and associated with
   significant impairment.
   OBJECTIVE: Systematically review studies of psychosocial interventions
   for children with disruptive behavior disorders.
   METHODS: We searched Medline (via PubMed), Embase, and PsycINFO. Two
   reviewers assessed studies against predetermined inclusion criteria.
   Data were extracted by 1 team member and reviewed by a second. We
   categorized interventions as having only a child component, only a
   parent component, or as multicomponent interventions.
   RESULTS: Sixty-six studies were included. Twenty-eight met criteria for
   inclusion in our meta-analysis. The effect size for the multicomponent
   interventions and interventions with only a parent component had the
   same estimated value, with a median of -1.2 SD reduction in outcome
   score (95\% credible interval, -1.6 to -0.9). The estimate for
   interventions with only a child component was -1.0 SD (95\% credible
   interval, -1.6 to -0.4).
   LIMITATIONS: Methodologic limitations of the available evidence (eg,
   inconsistent or incomplete outcome reporting, inadequate blinding or
   allocation concealment) may compromise the strength of the evidence.
   Population and intervention inclusion criteria and selected outcome
   measures eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis may limit
   applicability of the results.
   CONCLUSIONS: The 3 intervention categories were more effective than the
   control conditions. Interventions with a parent component, either alone
   or in combination with other components, were likely to have the largest
   effect. Although additional research is needed in the community setting,
   our findings suggest that the parent component is critical to successful
   intervention.}},

Title = {{Thirteen years of continued application of composted organic wastes in a
   vineyard modify soil quality characteristics}},
Journal = {{SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{241-254}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A solution for environmentally wiser agriculture is the use of composted
   organic wastes as soil amendments. Just as this alleviates the problem
   of recycling organic residues, it provides necessary nutrient input for
   food production. The objective of this work was to study the effect that
   13 years of applying three different composted organic wastes or organic
   amendments have had on soil quality, GHG emissions and the dynamics of
   its microbial communities 15 days after the annual application. For this
   purpose, in 1996 a field trial was set up in a Tempranillo vineyard.
   Since 1998, the applied organic amendments have been as follows: 1. a
   pelletized organic compost (PEL) made from plant, animal and sewage
   sludge residues; 2. a compost made from the organic fraction of
   municipal solid waste (OF-MSW); 3. a compost made of stabilized sheep
   manure (SMC); 4. a mineral fertilizer (NPK); and 5. an unaltered
   control. The mean annual doses applied since 1998 have been 3700 kg
   ha(-1) fresh weight (FW) of PEL, 4075 kg ha(-1) FW of OF-MSW, 4630 kg
   ha(-1) FW of SMC, and 340 kg ha(-1) of NPK treatment. Soil quality was
   consistently enhanced by amendment application over the 13 years. Total
   nitrogen was significantly increased in PEL (0.1\%), OF-MSW (0.09\%) and
   SMC (0.1\%) compared to control (0.06\%). Nutrient content was also
   improved in a similar way, e.g. the most significant increase in P Olsen
   (80.7 mg kg(-1)) and K2O (473.8 mg kg(-1)) was found on SMC. The overall
   enzyme activity was also increased 15 days after the annual application
   and OF-MSW had the highest rate (95.9) compared to control (51.3). This
   increase in metabolic activity was also recorded in GHG emissions. CO2
   equivalents per hectare were 1745 kg for OF-MSW and it was the only
   significant difference found. PEL with 1598 kg and SMC with 1591 kg were
   not different from the Control (1104 kg). Even though GHG emissions in
   the soil increased because of the application, soil organic matter
   content increased significantly (at least 35\% more in all organic
   treatments compared to control) and this rise in organic matter was
   consistent over the years. According to the results, 85\% of the
   sequences corresponded to 5 main phyla: Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria,
   Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria and Gemmatimonadetes, with unclassified
   material making up for 10.9\% (average) of the sequences. Bacterial
   diversity by Shannon and Chao1 indices was not affected 15 days after
   the application. However, slight changes in the bacterial community were
   recorded 15 days after application only in OF-MSW treatment. Assessing
   soil quality using these three factors allows the relevant agronomical
   capabilities of the soil to be integrated with the potential effect of
   this practise on global warming. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 is an autosomal recessive disorder that is
   responsible for the overproduction of oxalate and has an incidence of 1
   in 120 000 live births. Indications for combined liver and kidney
   transplant are still debated. However, combined liver and kidney
   transplant is preferred in various conditions, including primary
   hyperoxaluria, liver-based metabolic abnormalities affecting the kidney,
   and structural diseases affecting both the liver and the kidney, such as
   congenital hepatic fibrosis and polycystic kidney disease. When compared
   with sequential liver and kidney transplant, the rejection rate of both
   liver and kidney allografts was reported to be lower than with combined
   liver and kidney transplant. With proper anesthesia management, the
   probable increased complications with combined liver and kidney
   transplant can be prevented. In this report, we present the anesthesia
   care of a 22-year-old patient with primary hyperoxaluria type 1 who had
   deceased-donor combined liver and kidney transplant.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE
   The global epidemics of type 2 diabetes and obesity have been attributed
   to the interaction between lifestyle changes and genetic predisposition
   to these diseases. We compared the prevalences of type 2 diabetes and
   obesity in Mexican Pima Indians, presumed to have a high genetic
   predisposition to these diseases, to those in their non-Pima neighbors,
   both of whom over a 15-year period experienced a transition from a
   traditional to a more modern lifestyle.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
   Prevalence of diabetes, impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose
   tolerance, and obesity in Mexican Pimas (n = 359) and non-Pima Mexicans
   (n = 251) were determined in 2010 using methods identical to those used
   in 1995.
   RESULTS
   During this 15-year period, age-adjusted diabetes prevalence was
   unchanged in Pima men (5.8\% in 1995 vs. 6.1\% in 2010) yet increased in
   non-Pima men from 0.0 to 8.6\% (P < 0.05). Diabetes prevalence tended to
   increase in both Pima women (9.4 vs. 13.4\%) and non-Pima women (4.8 vs.
   9.5\%). Age-adjusted prevalence of obesity increased significantly in
   all groups (6.6 vs. 15.7\% in Pima men; 8.5 vs. 20.5\% in non-Pima men;
   18.9. vs 36.3\% in Pima women; 29.5 vs. 42.9\% in non-Pima women).
   CONCLUSIONS
   Type 2 diabetes prevalence increased between 1995 and 2010 in non-Pima
   men, and to a lesser degree in women of both groups, but it did not
   increase in Pima men. Prevalence of obesity increased among Pimas and
   non-Pimas of both sexes. These changes occurred concomitantly with an
   environmental transition from a traditional to a more modernized
   lifestyle.}},

Abstract = {{Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has proven to be an
   invaluable method of cardiopulmonary support in cases of severe
   cardiogenic shock. In an emergency, femoral artery and vein cannulation
   is the easiest and quickest access to initiate support. Often, with
   peripheral venous-arterial ECMO (VA ECMO), an inadequate reduction in
   left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) is present secondary to
   increased afterload from retrograde flow, inadequate RV drainage or
   persistent bronchial circulation. Elevated LVEDP has been known to be
   associated with poor myocardial recovery, LV thrombus formation and
   significant pulmonary edema. A cannulation strategy to achieve partial
   ventricular unloading is of paramount importance when considering ECMO
   support following cardiogenic shock to increase the potential for
   myocardial recovery. We present a novel case of emergent peripheral VA
   ECMO cannulation with a trans-diaphragmatic left ventricular (LV) vent
   in a 61-year-old, 79kg male with end-stage liver disease and hepatitis B
   cirrhosis who suffered cardiac arrest during orthotopic liver

Abstract = {{Background: Desmoplastic trichoepithelioma (DTE), morpheaform basal cell
   carcinoma (BCC) and microcystic adnexal carcinoma (MAC) are sclerosing
   adnexal neoplasms with overlapping histopathologic features. We compared
   cytokeratin 15, (CK15), T-cell death-associated gene 51 (TDAG51),
   cytokeratin 20 (CK20) and androgen receptor (AR) in differentiating
   these tumors and assessed their expression in BCC subtypes.
   Methods: Fifteen DTE, 15 infundibulocystic BCC, 18 micronodular BCC, 18
   morpheaform BCC and 6 MAC were assessed for CK15, TDAG51, CK20 and AR
   expression.
   Results: Quantitative CK15 staining was higher in DTE compared with BCC
   (p < 0.0001) and MAC (p = 0.02). Quantitative TDAG51 staining was higher
   in DTE than BCC (p < 0.0001). The CK20+AR- immunophenotype was 100\%
   sensitive and specific in diagnosing DTE. The CK20-AR+ immunophenotype
   was 95.24\% specific and 83.33\% sensitive for BCC. The CK20-AR-
   immunophenotype was 83.33\% sensitive and 90.91\% specific for MAC.
   CK15, CK20 and AR were positive in 87, 53 and 67\% of infundibulocystic
   BCC cases, respectively.
   Conclusion: Combination of CK20 and AR best differentiated these
   sclerosing adnexal neoplasms. Greater positivity for CK15 and TDAG51
   generally favors benign lesions. Infundibulocystic BCC has higher CK20
   and lower AR immunopositivity than other BCC variants and a high degree
   of CK15 and TDAG51 positivity.}},

Abstract = {{IntroductionA randomized multicenter study was conducted in the
   Stockholm-orebro areas in Sweden to evaluate how treatment aiming at
   normoglycemia affects fetal growth, pregnancy and neonatal outcome in
   pregnant women with severe hyperglycemia.
   Material and methodsPregnant women with hyperglycemia defined as fasting
   capillary plasma glucose <7.0 mmol/L and a two-hour plasma glucose value
   10.0 and <12.2 mmol/L following a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test
   (OGTT) diagnosed before 34 weeks of gestation were randomized to
   treatment (n=33) or controls (n=36). Women assigned to the control group
   were blinded for the OGTT results and received routine care. The
   therapeutic goal was fasting plasma glucose 4-5 mmol/L, and <6.5 mmol/L
   after a meal. Primary outcomes were size at birth and number of
   large-for-gestational age (>90th percentile) neonates. Secondary
   outcomes were pregnancy complications, neonatal morbidity and glycemic
   control.
   ResultsThe planned number of participating women was not reached. There
   was a significantly reduced rate of large-for-gestational age neonates,
   21 vs. 47\%, P<0.05. Group differences in pregnancy complications and
   neonatal morbidity were not detected because of limited statistical
   power. In total, 66.7\% of the women in the intervention group received
   insulin. Of all measured plasma glucose values, 64.1\% were in the
   target range, 7.2\% in the hypoglycemic range and 28.7\% above target
   values. There were no cases of severe hypoglycemia.
   ConclusionsAiming for normalized glycemia in a pregnancy complicated by
   severe hyperglycemia reduces fetal growth but is associated with an
   increased rate of mild hypoglycemia.}},

Abstract = {{In the current study, remoteness of memories predicted overgeneral
   memory (OGM), and the tendency for remote recall was unrelated to either
   rumination or avoidance tendencies. In Experiments 1 and 2, dysphoric
   and nondysphoric participants dated their memories on autobiographical
   memory tests. Remoteness was related to OGM regardless of dysphoria.
   Furthermore, when instructed to recall from a specific time period,
   nondysphoric and dysphoric individuals showed similar levels of OGM for
   remote events and similar levels of memory specificity for recent
   events. Dysphoria correlated with OGM and the tendency to recall more
   remote memories, but remoteness was a better predictor of OGM and
   emerged as a mediating factor. In Experiment 3, remote memory recall was
   a better predictor of OGM than were either rumination or avoidance
   tendencies and was not correlated with either. We suggest that OGM is
   crucially tied to remote recall tendencies and discuss the theoretical
   and clinical implications within the framework of current models.}},

Abstract = {{Heavy metal is regarded as one of the most representative contaminants
   in soil, and the chemical speciation is greatly related to the toxicity
   and transformation behavior, which attracts the attention of researchers
   for years. The environmental factors could change the speciation of
   heavy metals, plus to the complexity of soil system, and the
   transformation variation of speciation might occasional existed under
   similar conditions. At present, the different viewpoints of related
   issues are urgent to be investigated. The characteristics of DOM from
   straw humification were revealed with UV spectra, 3D-EEMs spectra and
   FTIR spectra, and the Tessier Sequential Extraction Procedure was used
   to study the speciation transformation behavior of lead affected by DOM.
   The linear relationship of the contents between DOC and lead bound to
   organic matter was indicated to further discuss the influence mechanism
   of lead speciation using FTIR. The results showed: the absorbance peak
   of DOM located in 229 nm in UV spectra, and the fluorescence peaks
   appeared around the regions of lambda(ex/em) = 250/350 nm, lambda(ex/em)
   = 250/450 nm and lambda(ex/em) = 330/450 ma, referred as UV fulvic-like
   fluorescence, and visible humic-like fluorescence, respectively. The
   dominant functional groups of DOM included -OH, C=O and N-H. The three
   fractions contents of lead ( exchangeable, bound to iron and manganese
   oxides, residual) decreased, while that of lead bound to carbonates
   varied little. The contents of DOC and lead bound to organic matter
   appeared positive correlation (r=0.691 8), indicating the effective
   complexation between DOM and lead ions. The functional groups of -OH,
   C=O and -COOH played an important role for the speciation transformation
   of lead, suggested from the FTIR spectra.}},

Abstract = {{Alterations in insulin granule exocytosis and endocytosis are paramount
   to pancreatic beta cell dysfunction in diabetes mellitus. Here, using
   temporally controlled gene ablation specifically in beta cells in mice,
   we identified an essential role of dynamin 2 GTPase in preserving normal
   biphasic insulin secretion and blood glucose homeostasis. Dynamin 2
   deletion in beta cells caused glucose intolerance and substantial
   reduction of the second phase of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion
   (GSIS); however, mutant beta cells still maintained abundant insulin
   granules, with no signs of cell surface expansion. Compared with control
   beta cells, real-time capacitance measurements demonstrated that
   exocytosis-endocytosis coupling was less efficient but not abolished;
   clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) was severely impaired at the step of
   membrane fission, which resulted in accumulation of clathrin-coated
   endocytic intermediates on the plasma membrane. Moreover, dynamin 2
   ablation in beta cells led to striking reorganization and enhancement of
   actin filaments, and insulin granule recruitment and mobilization were
   impaired at the later stage of GSIS. Together, our results demonstrate
   that dynamin 2 regulates insulin secretory capacity and dynamics in vivo
   through a mechanism depending on CME and F-actin remodeling. Moreover,
   this study indicates a potential pathophysiological link between
   endocytosis and diabetes mellitus.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) have recently been
   implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma through inhibiting T cell
   response. However, the issue of whether Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-derived
   MDSCs regulate the immune response in an asthma environment is currently
   unclear. We sought to characterize the pathogenic function of various
   subtypes of MDSCs in asthma mediated by ovalbumin in mice model, in
   order to show that LPS-induced MDSCs can shift the balance back to
   normal in a Th2-dominant asthmatic environment.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subgroups of MDSCs with Ly6C(+)Ly6G(+),
   Ly6C(-)Ly6G(+), Ly6C(+)Ly6G(-) or Ly6C(-)Ly6G(-) expression were
   isolated by flow cytometry and were co-cultured with spleen lymphocytes.
   The proportion of Th1, Th2, or Treg cells in the treated spleen
   lymphocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry. In an ovalbumin
   (OVA)-induced mouse asthma model, mice were intravenously injected (tail
   vein) by MDSCs with specific marker, then the lung function and tissue
   pathology, IL-4 content in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and
   peripheral blood, and proportion of Th1, Th2, or Treg cells in
   peripheral blood were analyzed.
   RESULTS: Ly6C(+)lLy6G(+) MDSCs transferred into asthmatic mice via
   intravenous injection suppressed the infiltration of inflammatory cells
   into the lung and Th2 cytokine in BALF and blood. We observed a
   significant increase of Treg cells in the spleen lymphocytes co-cultured
   with Ly6C(+)Ly6G(+), Ly6C(-)Ly6G(+), Ly6C(+)Ly6G(-), Ly6C(-)Ly6G(-) or
   CD11b(+) MDSCs. The adoptive transfer of Ly6C(+)Ly6G(+), Ly6C(-)Ly6G(+),
   CD11b(+) MDSCs resulted in decrease of Penh, total cell number,
   eosinophil and neutrophil percentage in BALF, and concentration of IL-4
   in BALF and serum, thus improving the inflammatory injury,
   histopathology and lung function in the mice with asthma. The
   up-regulation of the Th1/Th2 ratio and Treg frequency were observed
   after adoptive transfer of Ly6C(+)Ly6G(+), Ly6C(-)Ly6G(+),
   Ly6C(+)Ly6G(-), Ly6C(-)Ly6G(-)nand CD11b(+) MDSCs.
   CONCLUSIONS: The LPS-derived MDSCs with specific markers were able to
   suppress natural inflammatory response and improve inflammatory injury
   through reversing Th1/Th2 ratio, increasing Treg proportion and
   decreasing IL-4 concentration. These findings imply that LPS-derived
   MDSCs inhibit Th2 cell-medicated response against allergen. We propose
   that asthma may be effectively targeted using a novel MDSC-based cell
   therapy approach.}},

Abstract = {{The demographic performance of avian predators is influenced by climate
   variations. The Plant Area Index (PAI) is considered a key descriptor of
   the (evolving) vegetation sensitive to climate and soil aridity and
   drought stress. To assess if the increased aridity regime in the
   mediterranean region affects the reproduction of a forest predator, the
   breeding success of the Tawny Owl Strix aluco was studied over 7 years
   (1997-2003) in Castelporziano, central Italy. The inter-annual
   fluctuations in owl demographic output observed in neighbor forest and
   agricultural sites were compared with climatic variables (rainfall,
   minimum and maximum air temperature, aridity index) and changes in the
   PAI estimated by satellite imagery. Out of 326 breeding attempts, the
   percentage of successful pairs per year ranged between 4 and 28 \%, the
   number of fledglings per successful pair ranged between 1.0 and 1.8 and
   breeding rate (i.e. the number of fledglings per breeding pair) ranged
   between 0.1 and 0.4. Demographic, climatic and remotely sensed indexes
   showed coherent variations among years. Rainfall and lower aridity index
   are associated with a higher breeding success. The relationship between
   PAI and breeding rate was found significant only in forest sites.
   Results suggest that Tawny Owls may positively respond to drier weather
   conditions by reducing the breeding rate.}},

Title = {{Impact of the Supervisor on Worker Safety Behavior in Construction
   Projects}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{As a major organizational antecedent of worker safety behavior (WSB),
   management behavior is drawing more and more academic attention because
   it tends to be the root cause of occupational safety accidents. The
   current behavior-based safety (BBS) practices in construction do not
   sufficiently take management behavior into consideration, which leads to
   superficial and nonpersistent intervention impacts on unsafe behavior.
   In academia, the relationship between management behavior and employees'
   individual behavior in construction has not been clearly studied and
   precisely depicted. This paper is aimed at discovering those management
   behaviors which can significantly impact worker safety behavior in
   construction projects and depict the exact impacting paths. Supervisors
   were on the focus because they interact with workers most profoundly and
   frequently among all levels of the management. Two dimensions of
   supervisory behavior were identified, namely (1) training and preventive
   action, and (2) reactive and supportive action. Group-level safety
   climate was used as the mediator along the influencing paths. A 3-month
   strictly controlled questionnaire survey was undertaken in the Hong Kong
   construction industry to collect empirical data. Results obtained from
   confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling showed
   that both direct and indirect impacts of supervisory behavior on worker
   safety behavior exist. Reactive and supportive action has a direct
   impact on worker safety behavior, but no impact on safety climate.
   Training and preventive action can influence different aspects of safety
   climate of the construction sites (like supervisory environment and
   workers' involvement), and thus improve safety conditions in a more
   profound (and comprehensive) manner than reactive and supportive action.
   This paper establishes the detailed empirical links among operational
   management behavior, group-level safety climate, and worker safety
   behavior in the construction settings, which can give significant
   insights into the development of safety management theories and
   practices. This can further help practitioners design enhanced BBS
   intervention approaches which can have a more sustainable and persistent
   impact on worker safety behavior. Specific recommendations and
   suggestions are provided for future BBS practices in construction. (C)

Abstract = {{Responses of compensatory growth to high temperature and feed
   restriction in juvenile tongue sole, Cynoglossus semilaevis (Guther,
   1873), were investigated during a 56-days experiment. Fish were divided
   into seven groups including three high-temperature treatments which were
   reared at 28 degrees C for 1, 2 and 3weeks, respectively, then returned
   to 22 degrees C (recorded as T1, T2 and T3), three feed-restricted
   treatments which were fed 25\% satiation for 1, 2 and 3weeks,
   respectively, then fed ad libitum (recorded as R1, R2 and R3) and a
   control (continuously reared at 22 degrees C). The results showed that
   juvenile tongue sole exposed to thermal stress for 1week exhibited
   overcompensatory growth. However, complete compensation occurred in T2,
   T3 and R1 fish, while partial compensation occurred in R2 and R3 fish.
   The body composition and energy content of fish were not significantly
   different among all treatments (P>0.05). The specific growth rate and
   feed efficiency of fish in T1 were significantly higher than other
   treatments during the whole experiment period (P<0.05). Higher feed
   efficiency and apparent digestion rate during recovery might account for
   the compensatory growth in tongue sole in the present study. Hyperphagia
   played an important role in compensatory growth for feed-restricted
   fish, but was not involved in the compensatory response in thermal
   stressed fish in the present study. The results from the present study
   suggested that a suitable thermal stress could be more feasible to
   elicit compensatory growth than feed restriction in juvenile tongue
   sole.}},

Abstract = {{Friction plays a critical role in the function and maintenance of
   small-scale structures, where the conventional Coulomb friction law
   often fails. To probe the friction at small scales, here we present a
   molecular dynamics study on the process of dragging graphene nanoribbons
   on waved graphene substrates. The simulation shows that the induced
   friction on graphene with zero waviness is ultra-low and closely related
   to the surface energy barrier. On waved graphenes, the friction
   generally increases with the amplitude of the wave at a fixed period,
   but anomalously increases and then decreases with the period at a fixed
   amplitude. These findings provide insights into the ultra-low friction
   at small scales, as well as some guidelines into the fabrication of
   graphene-based nano-composites with high performance. (C) 2015 The

Title = {{Comprehensive Interactome of Otx2 in the Adult Mouse Neural Retina}},
Journal = {{GENESIS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{53}},

Pages = {{685-694}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The Otx2 homeodomain transcription factor exerts multiple functions in
   specific developmental contexts, probably through the regulation of
   different sets of genes. Protein partners of Otx2 have been shown to
   modulate its activity. Therefore, the Otx2 interactome may play a key
   role in selecting a precise target-gene repertoire, hence determining
   its function in a specific tissue. To address the nature of Otx2
   interactome, we generated a new recombinant Otx2 CTAP-tag mouse line,
   designed for protein complexes purification. We validated this mouse
   line by establishing the Otx2 interactome in the adult neural retina. In
   this tissue, Otx2 is thought to have overlapping function with its
   paralog Crx. Our analysis revealed that, in contrary to Crx, Otx2 did
   not develop interactions with proteins that are known to regulate
   phototransduction genes but showed specific partnership with factors
   associated with retinal development. The relationship between Otx2 and
   Crx in the neural retina should therefore be considered as
   complementarity rather than redundancy. Furthermore, study of the Otx2
   interactome revealed strong associations with RNA processing and
   translation machineries, suggesting unexpected roles for Otx2 in the
   regulation of selected target genes all along the
   transcription/translation pathway. The Otx2 CTAP-tag line, therefore,
   appears suitable for a systematic approach to Otx2 protein-protein
   interactions. genesis 53: 685-694, 2015. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{Enterococcus is an important pathogen all around the world, known as an
   important nosocomial pathogen. This study determined the strains and
   antibiotics susceptibility of Enterococci isolated from clinical samples
   in Imam Ali Hospital in Kermanshah, Iran, from July 2014 to July 2015.
   This experimental study was performed on 58 Enterococci strains isolated
   from clinical samples in Imam Ali Hospital in Kermanshah, Iran.
   Patients' information was collected by a questionnaire. After isolating
   and identifying 58 strains of Enterococci from clinical samples,
   complimentary tests were carried out. Antibiogram test was performed by
   Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method and CLSI criteria. Statistical
   analysis was performed using the SPSS 16. The frequencies of the
   isolated Enterococci species included E. faecalis with 72.41\% (42
   cases), E. feacium with 13.79\% (8 cases), E. hirea with 6.9\% (4
   cases), E. avium with 3.44\% (2 cases), E. gallinarium with 1.73\% (1
   case), and E. mundtii with 1.73\% (1 case). Most of Enterococci strains
   were isolated from urine samples with 48.27\% (28 cases). The highest
   and lowest resistances were to penicillin (95\%) and linezolid (0\%),
   respectively. We found a significant statistical difference between
   Enterococcus and time of hospital stay (P = 0.03). Based on the results
   of the present study, E. faecalis was, by far, the most predominant
   isolate. This suggests that in order to prevent the antibiotic
   resistance and select an appropriate antibiotic before the treatment,
   antibiogram test should be done for each patient.}},

Abstract = {{Decreasing feed costs while maintaining broiler performance at a high
   level with minimal environmental pollution has become a major challenge
   for poultry nutritionists in recent years. In this regard, phosphorus
   (P) is a nutrient that is problematic. To overcome this, a comprehensive
   knowledge of the responses of broilers to P is needed and the factors
   that affect its utilization need better understanding. For this purpose,
   a meta-analysis was conducted using results published in the literature
   on the responses of broilers to different levels of nonphytate P (NPP),
   calcium (Ca), microbial phytase (MP), and vitamin D3 or its metabolites
   (VD). The effects of Ca, MP, and VD on NPP requirements were
   investigated. Results showed significant (P <= 0.0001) linear and
   quadratic effects of NPP on all the responses, viz. average daily gain
   (ADG), feed intake (FI), feed efficiency (FE), and tibia ash
   concentration (TA). Results showed the negative effect of high Ca levels
   on all investigated responses, although these deleterious effects were
   alleviated when levels of NPP were increased or MP and/or VD added.
   Synergistic effects of MP and VD on FI and TA were observed. Best
   performance for all responses was found when MP and VD were added to low
   or moderate levels of Ca and NPP. Optimization showed higher levels of
   NPP are required to maximize TA compared to ADG, FI, and FE. Based on
   our analysis, requirements for NPP were affected mostly by Ca
   (increased) and MP (decreased), and, to a lesser extent, VD
   (inconsistent).}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to measure the daily prevalence
   of adhesive product use and related skin injuries in adult patients in a
   non-intensive care unit setting.
   DESIGN: Prospective, descriptive study.
   SUBJECTS AND SETTING: The study sample consisted of patients cared for
   on 2 inpatient care units in a university-based acute care facility in
   the Midwestern United States. One was a 30-bed medical/surgical unit and
   the second was a 35-bed cardiac/telemetry unit. Their median age was 58
   years; the average daily proportion of males and females was 56\% and
   42\%, respectively.
   METHODS: Medical adhesive-related skin injury (MARSI) prevalence was
   calculated using 3 methods: (1) the proportion of subjects who had any
   MARSI injury (subject prevalence), (2) the prevalence of MARSI by injury
   type and severity (severity prevalence), and (3) the proportion of
   medical adhesive products that had any associated MARSI (product
   prevalence).
   RESULTS: The daily subject prevalence of any MARSI injury ranged from
   3.4\% to 25.0\% with a mean and median of 13.0\% and 12.7\%,
   respectively. The severity prevalence of MARSI injury ranged from 8 to
   149 per 1000 product-days with a mean and median of 63 and 56 MARSIs per
   1000 product-days, respectively. The median (range) product prevalence
   among all adhesive products varied from a high of 70 injuries per 1000
   product-days for surgical closure to a low of 0 injuries per 1000
   product-days for peripheral intravenous line dressing.
   CONCLUSIONS: Medical adhesive-related skin injury is a prevalent event
   in the acute care setting. Preventing skin injury has the potential to
   reduce complications, increase patient satisfaction, and improve
   clinical outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{In this research, a conventional steam methane reforming (SMR) reactor
   is modified to enhance CH4 conversion and decreasing pressure drop
   considering membrane and distributed feeding policy. In the proposed
   structure, some feeding points are considered along the membrane reactor
   and steam is injected to the reactor through feeding nodes. It is
   demonstrated that a suitable distributed feeding policy improves
   performance of SMR process. The modified membrane reactor is modeled
   based on the mass and energy conservation laws. In the optimization
   section, the optimal rate of steam injection at considered nodes are
   calculated to maximize CH4 conversion and minimize pressure drop based
   on the multi-objective optimization considering coke formation
   limitations. The elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm is
   employed to obtain the Pareto frontier in two objective spaces. The
   single optimal solution is selected from Pareto frontier by the
   decision-making methods including Shannon Entropy, LINMAP and TOPSIS.
   The results show that as well as lower pressure drop and higher methane
   conversion, hydrogen production is improved about 18.09\% in the
   optimized configuration based TOPSIS methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Objective: To evaluate changes in airway volumes and respiratory
   performance in patients undergoing rapid maxillary expansion and
   determine whether any correlations exist between the morphological and
   respiratory functional modifications induced by rapid maxillary
   expansion and pretreatment airway stenosis.
   Materials and methods: Fifteen patients (11 females and 4 males; mean
   age, 7.5 +/- 0.3 years) were enrolled in the study. Each patient
   underwent cone beam computed tomography and polysomnography examination
   before rapid maxillary expansion and after the removal of the maxillary
   expander 12 months later. The airway regions were segmented and the
   volumes were computed.
   Results: The upper, middle, and lower airway volumes were significantly
   increased 2305 mm(3), 1144 mm3, and 1915 mm3, respectively. Similarly,
   oxygen saturation was increased (+5.3\%) and the apnea/hypopnea index
   was improved (-4.2 events). All the observed modifications were
   statistically significant (P < .05). Baseline middle and lower airway
   volume showed a significant negative correlation with the oxygen
   saturation modification.
   Conclusions: The results of this study showed that when rapid maxillary
   expansion is performed in subjects having posterior crossbite, oxygen
   saturation is improved. The improvement is greater in subjects having
   more reduced middle and lower airway volumes.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies report that a very simple strategy to improve the corrosion
   resistance of aluminium is to promote the formation of a pseudo-boehmite
   (Al2O3 center dot H2O) layer by a hydrothermal process (i.e. immersion

   durations of a boiling water treatment was investigated. In particular,
   the work is focussed on the corrosion protection properties of a sol-gel
   layer further applied to the treated aluminium panels and its
   interaction with the underlying pseudo-bohemite layer. Films consisting
   of 1: 1 molar ratio of 3-glycidoxypropyltrime- thoxysilane (GLYMO) and
   methyltriethoxysilane (MTES) were applied on AA1050 plates. For this
   purpose, the effect of the different periods of immersion in boiling
   water was investigated in terms of morphology by means of scanning
   electron microscope, in terms of surface chemistry by means of FT-IR and
   in terms of electrochemical activity of the surface by exploiting

Abstract = {{Ankle ligament lesions are one of the most common injuries. In 20-30\%
   of cases ligament rupture can lead to chronic functional and/or

   ankle pain upon weight bearing leads to limitations regarding physical
   activity and work. The first-line treatment of chronic ankle instability
   is conservative to improve the range of motion, muscle control and
   proprioceptive function. If conservative treatment is inadequate,
   surgical intervention is necessary. Ankle arthroscopy should be
   performed prior to ligament reconstruction to detect and treat
   intraarticular lesions. Surgical techniques focus on the reconstruction
   of the lateral and medial ligament complex. Their aim is to restore
   ligament stability with suture anchors, transosseous fixation, or tendon

Abstract = {{Introduction: Researchers have increasingly used collateral informants
   to validate the reports provided by primary research subjects. We
   assessed the utility of collateral informants for college students in a
   study that incorporates biomarkers to validate student reports of recent
   drinking behavior.
   Methods: Students from a Midwestern university were randomly selected
   for a study in which they provided 90-day Timeline Followbacic data,
   hair and fingernail specimens for ethylglucuronide (EtG) testing, and
   information about collateral (friends or peers) informants who were
   familiar with their drinking behavior. We compared summary measures of
   recent drinking to collateral informant reports for the subset of 72
   students who were selected to participate in the collateral validation
   process who had complete measures. Kappa, weighted kappa, and McNemar
   tests were performed to evaluate levels of agreement. We compared levels
   of use indicated by each informant within the context of EtG findings.
   We also compared respondent and collateral reports with respect to heavy
   drinking directly to EtG test results.
   Results: There was considerable overlap between the reports provided by
   the student participants and their collateral informants. Within the
   context of EtG-informed analyses, collaterals rarely provided new
   information about heavy use beyond that provided by the study subjects.
   Conclusions: Collateral informants have limited utility in non-clinical
   studies of heavy drinking in randomly selected college students. (C)

Abstract = {{A spherical spiral groove gas bearing has the ability to not only
   support radial and axial loads simultaneously but also tolerate
   extensive misalignment. Thus, this bearing type is considered suitable
   as a supporting and lubrication component of inertial components such as
   gyroscopes in the fields of aerospace and navigation. In this study, we
   propose a numerical method for predicting static and dynamic
   characteristics and conduct a parametric analysis of an aerodynamic
   spherical bearing with rotating spiral grooves. The finite difference
   method and the perturbation method are used to calculate the Reynolds
   equation to obtain the force coefficients. Given the complicated groove
   distribution, as well as film discontinuity and compressibility, solving
   the equations numerically in the spherical coordinates system is
   difficult. Parameter transformation and oblique coordinate
   transformation are thus applied in this study to modify the Reynolds
   equation into the planar oblique coordinate system. An eight-point
   method is also utilized to deal with film thickness discontinuity. The
   predictions of this proposed method show good agreement with the
   available experimental data. Parametric studies on nominal clearance,
   eccentricity ratio, rotating speed, groove depth, groove angle, and
   perturbation frequency are then conducted to determine optimum design
   parameters. The results show that these factors significantly affect
   bearing characteristics in both the radial and axial directions.}},

Abstract = {{At three critical temperatures which were obtained by
   thermo-gravimetry-differential thermal analysis-differential scanning
   calorimetry (TG/DTG/DSC) curves of lanthanum nitrate crystal, the air
   thermal decomposition experiments and solid-liquid spray doping
   simulation procedures of lanthanum nitrate crystal were carried out, and
   their products were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Meanwhile, the
   spray doping processing of MoO2-50 wt\% La(NO3)(3) composite powder was
   undergone with lanthanum nitrate solution as the dopant, and doped MoO2
   powder was analyzed by XRD. The results demonstrate that during the
   traditional solid-liquid spray doping processing, lanthanum nitrate, in
   the form of either crystal or aqueous solution, would be converted into
   La(NO3)(3)center dot 4H(2)O by the dehydration reaction, rather than be
   decomposed to La2O3 and NO or NO2. Therefore, it is inferred that the
   oxynitride gas produced from the process is attributed to the
   decomposition of residual HNO3 in lanthanum nitrate crystal. The source
   of HNO3 is supported by the chemical composition of lanthanum nitrate
   crystal.}},

Abstract = {{Oxidation is an important factor for denaturing of whey protein isolate
   (WPI) during food processing. We studied the effects of chemical
   oxidation on physicochemical and structural changes along with in vitro
   digestibility of WPI in this work. Evaluation of physicochemical changes
   showed that carbonyl level and dityrosine content increased, whereas
   total and free thiol group levels decreased for oxidized WPI samples.
   For the structural changes, protein aggregation was measured by surface
   hydrophobicity, turbidity, and particle diameter, which was increased
   for oxidized WPI samples. The increase of the secondary structure
   beta-sheets and antiparallel beta-sheet also supported the aggregation
   of oxidized WPI. A direct quantitative relationship between
   physicochemical and structural changes and protein digestibility
   indicated that oxidation-related damage restricts the susceptibility of
   WPI to proteases. In conclusion, WPI had high susceptibility to
   oxidative stress, and both physicochemical and structural changes caused
   by severe oxidative stress could decrease the rate of in vitro
   digestibility of WPI.}},

Abstract = {{Distinguishing the sources, ages, and fate of various terrestrial
   organic carbon (OC) pools mobilized from heterogeneous Arctic landscapes
   is key to assessing climatic impacts on the fluvial release of carbon
   from permafrost. Through molecular C-14 measurements, including novel
   analyses of suberin- and/or cutin-derived diacids (DAs) and hydroxy
   fatty acids (FAs), we compared the radiocarbon characteristics of a
   comprehensive suite of terrestrial markers (including plant wax lipids,
   cutin, suberin, lignin, and hydroxy phenols) in the sedimentary
   particles from nine major arctic and subarctic rivers in order to
   establish a benchmark assessment of the mobilization patterns of
   terrestrial OC pools across the pan-Arctic. Terrestrial lipids,
   including suberin-derived longer-chain DAs (C-24,C-26,C-28), plant wax
   FAs (C(24,26,2)8), and n-alkanes (C-27,C-29,C-31), incorporated
   significant inputs of aged carbon, presumably from deeper soil horizons.
   Mobilization and translocation of these ``old{''} terrestrial carbon
   components was dependent on nonlinear processes associated with
   permafrost distributions. By contrast, shorter-chain (C-16,C-18) DAs and
   lignin phenols (as well as hydroxy phenols in rivers outside eastern
   Eurasian Arctic) were much more enriched in C-14, suggesting
   incorporation of relatively young carbon supplied by runoff processes
   from recent vegetation debris and surface layers. Furthermore, the
   radiocarbon content of terrestrial markers is heavily influenced by
   specific OC sources and degradation status. Overall, multitracer
   molecular C-14 analysis sheds new light on the mobilization of
   terrestrial OC from arctic watersheds. Our findings of distinct ages for
   various terrestrial carbon components may aid in elucidating fate of
   different terrestrial OC pools in the face of increasing arctic
   permafrost thaw.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: To explore the association between alcohol consumption and the
   severity of diabetic retinopathy (DR).
   Methods: In this cross-sectional study, patients with type 2 diabetes
   answered questions on consumption of low and full-strength beer, white
   wine/champagne, red wine, fortified wines, and spirits. Never, moderate
   and high consumption of each alcoholic beverage, and overall alcoholic
   beverage consumption, were defined as <1,1-14 and >14 standard
   drinks/week, respectively. DR was categorized into none; non
   vision-threatening DR (VTDR) and VTDR. Multivariable logistic regression
   determined the associations between alcohol consumption and DR.
   Results: Of the 395 participants (mean age +/- SD {[}standard deviation]
   65.9 +/- 10.4 years; males = 253), 188 (47.6\%) consumed alcohol and 235
   (59.5\%) had any DR. Compared to no alcohol consumption, moderate
   alcohol consumption (overall) was significantly associated with reduced
   odds of any DR (OR = 0.47,95\% CI {[}confidence interval] 0.26-0.85).
   Moderate consumption of white wine/champagne or fortified wine was also
   associated with reduced odds of any DR (OR = 0.48, 95\% CI 0.25-0.91,
   and OR = 0.15, 95\% CI 0.04-0.62, respectively). Similar results were
   observed for non-VTDR and VTDR.
   Conclusions: The amount and type of alcohol are associated with risk of
   DR in patients with type 2 diabetes. A longitudinal study is needed to
   assess the protective effect of alcohol consumption and DR. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Primary aldosteronism is the most common form of secondary hypertension.
   Somatic mutations in KCNJ5, ATP1A1, ATP2B3, and CACNA1D are found in
   aldosterone-producing adenoma. In addition, adrenals with
   aldosterone-producing adenomas show cortical remodeling and frequently
   multiple secondary nodules. Our aim was to investigate whether different
   aldosterone-producing nodules from the same adrenal share the same
   mutational status. Aldosterone synthase expression was assessed in
   multinodular adrenals from 27 patients. DNA of 37 aldosterone-producing
   secondary nodules was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
   tissues and genotyped for KCNJ5, ATP1A1, ATP2B3, and CACNA1D mutations.
   Among 17 adrenals with a somatic mutation in the principal nodule, 4
   showed the same mutation in a secondary nodule, whereas 10 had no
   mutation in any of the known genes. In 1 adrenal harboring the KCNJ5
   p.Gly151Arg mutation in the principal nodule, the same mutation was
   present in 2 secondary nodules, but no mutation was found in a third
   nodule. Finally, in 2 adrenals with a CACNA1D mutation in the principal
   nodule, a KCNJ5 mutation was identified in the secondary nodule. Among
   10 adrenals without mutations in the principal nodule, 1 carried a KCNJ5
   mutation in the secondary nodule. No mutations were detected in 7
   aldosterone-producing cell clusters from 6 adrenals. No association was
   observed between the presence of mutations in secondary nodules and
   clinical parameters. In conclusion, different mutations are found in
   different aldosterone-producing nodules from the same adrenal,
   suggesting that somatic mutations are independent events triggered by
   mechanisms that remain to be identified.}},

Abstract = {{Let G = (V, E) denote a simple graph of order n and size m. For a
   non-empty subset S subset of V, and a vertex v is an element of V, we
   denote by N-S (v) the set of neighbors v has in S. We denote the degree
   of v in S by degS(v) = vertical bar N-S(v)vertical bar. The boundary of
   a set S subset of V is defined as partial derivative S = boolean OR(v is
   an element of S) N-(S) over bar(v). (S) over bar denotes the complement
   of S, i.e. (S) over bar = V \textbackslash{} S.
   A set D subset of V is called dominating if, for each v is an element of
   (D) over bar, N-D(v) not equal empty set. In this paper, we consider
   several variants of dominating sets. Consider the following condition
   ({*}): deg(s)(v) >= deg((S) over bar)(v) + r, which states that a vertex
   v has at least r more neighbors in S than it has in (S) over bar. A
   non-empty set S subset of V that satisfies Condition ({*}) for every
   vertex v is an element of S is called a defensive r-alliance; if S not
   equal empty set satisfies Condition ({*}) for every vertex v is an
   element of partial derivative S, then S is called an offensive
   r-alliance. A set S subset of V is a powerful r-alliance in G if S is
   both a defensive r-alliance and an offensive (r + 2)-alliance in G. An
   alliance is called global if it is also a dominating set. The global
   powerful r -alliance number, denoted by gamma(r){*}(G), is defined as
   the minimum cardinality of a global powerful r-alliance in G. We show
   that the natural decision problem associated to computing gamma(r){*}(G)
   is NP-complete and we obtain tight bounds for this domination-related
   parameter.
   A set S subset of V is a total k-dominating set if deg(S)(v) >= k, for
   all v is an element of V. The total k-domination number gamma(kt) (G) is
   the minimum cardinality of a total k-dominating set. We show that the
   problem of computing gamma(kt) (C) is NP-complete and we obtain a tight
   bound for this parameter, as well. Finally, we exhibit close
   relationships between total k-dominating sets and global (defensive /
   offensive / powerful) r-alliances, with r and k tightly coupled.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundCognitive dysfunction is considered a core feature of
   schizophrenia, and impaired performances in episodic memory (EM) and
   executive function (EF) tasks are consistently reported in schizophrenia
   patients. Traditional fMRI and EEG studies have helped identifying brain
   areas, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), involved in these tasks.
   However, it is unclear whether intrinsic defects in prefrontal function
   per se contribute to poor performance in schizophrenia, given the
   presence of confounds like reduced motivation and psychotic symptoms.
   TMS/hd-EEG measurements are obtained without cognitive effort, and can
   be calculated in any cortical area.
   MethodsWe performed TMS/hd-EEG recordings in parietal, motor, premotor,
   and PFC in healthy individuals (N=20) and schizophrenia patients (N=20).
   Source modeling of TMS-evoked responses was performed, and measures of
   cortical activity (significant current density, SCD) and connectivity
   (significant current scattering, SCS) were computed. Patients with
   schizophrenia also performed Penn Word memory delayed (CPWd) and Penn
   Conditional Exclusion Test (PCET). CPWd evaluates EM and involves
   primarily PFC, whereas PCET reflects EF and implicates PFC with other
   brain regions.
   FindingsWe found no difference in SCD and SCS after TMS of
   parietal/motor cortices, whereas those parameters were reduced in
   premotor/prefrontal areas in schizophrenia patients. In PFC, where these
   measures were most defective, SCD was negatively correlated with
   performance in CPWd whereas higher SCS values were associated with more
   errors in PCET.
   ConclusionThese findings indicate that schizophrenia patients have
   intrinsic defects in both activity and connectivity of PFC, and that
   these defects are specifically associated with impairments in cognitive
   abilities. Hum Brain Mapp 36:4539-4552, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley

Abstract = {{Oral anticoagulant therapy is widely used to prevent and treat
   thromboembolic events. Traditionally, warfarin has been the drug of
   choice providing a significant reduction in stroke risk in patients with
   atrial fibrillation. However, warfarin has several drawbacks, such as a
   delayed onset of anticoagulant action, a narrow therapeutic index, an
   unpredictable and variable response. The new oral anticoagulants
   (NOACs), dabigatran (a reversible direct thrombin inhibitor) and the
   direct factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban offer
   fixed dosing, more predictable pharmacokinetics and fewer interactions
   with drugs and food. Moreover, these drugs seem to provide an improved
   benefit-risk ratio with respect to thromboembolic events and bleeding
   complications in a broad patient population. However, significant
   differences between the four NOACs in terms of pharmacokinetic and
   safety profile are observed and must be considered to personalize the
   therapy based on the pathophysiological conditions of the patient. In
   the present review the pharmacological characteristics of NOACs in
   relationship to their safety and efficacy profiles will be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The complement (C') system and redox status play important roles in the
   physiological functioning of the body, such as the defense system, but
   they are also involved in various pathological conditions, including
   hemolytic anemia. Herein, we review the interaction between the C and
   the redox systems in C'-mediated hemolytic anemias, paroxysmal nocturnal
   hemoglobinuria (PNH) and autoimmune hemolytic anemia, including acute
   hemolytic transfusion reaction. Blood cells in these diseases have been
   shown to have increased oxidative status, which was further elevated by
   interaction with activated C'. The results suggest that oxidative
   stress, in conjunction with activated C, may cause the underlying
   symptoms of these diseases, such as intra- and extravascular hemolysis
   and thrombotic complications. Antioxidants ameliorate oxidative stress
   by preventing generation of free radicals, by scavenging and preventing
   their accumulation, and by correcting their cellular damage.
   Antioxidants have been shown to reduce the oxidative stress and inhibit
   hemolysis as well as platelet activation mediated by activated C'. This
   raises the possibility that treatment with antioxidants might be
   considered as a potential therapeutic modality for C-mediated hemolytic
   anemias. Currently, eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that
   specifically targets the C' protein C5, is the main treatment modality
   for PNH. However, because antioxidants are well tolerated and relatively
   inexpensive, they might be considered as potential adjuvants or an
   alternative therapeutic modality for PNH and other C'-mediated hemolytic
   anemias. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Since the first prostate cancer center was certified by the German
   Cancer Society (DKG) in 2008, there are currently 94 centers at 95
   sites. During certification, data on the implementation of the
   requirements are collected. These data can be used for benchmarking
   purposes.
   This paper describes the development and monitoring of indicators and
   presents a selection of recent results.
   The descriptive results on 18,288 primary cases from 91 sites with
   complete data are presented.
   The prostate cancer center certification system has reached a plateau
   both in regard to the absolute number of centers and the total
   proportion of all primary cases treated in Germany. The implementation
   of the requirements is at a high level overall, although some centers

Abstract = {{Background A key skill for a practising clinician is being able to do
   research, understand the statistical analyses and interpret results in
   the medical literature. Basic statistics has become essential within
   medical education, but when, what and in which format is uncertain.
   Methods To inform curriculum design/development we undertook a
   quantitative survey of fifth year medical students and followed them up
   with a series of focus groups to obtain their opinions as to what
   statistics teaching they want, when and how.
   Results A total of 145 students undertook the survey and five focus
   groups were held with between 3 and 9 participants each. Previous
   statistical training varied and students recognised their knowledge was
   inadequate and keen to see additional training implemented. Students
   were aware of the importance of statistics to their future careers, but
   apprehensive about learning. Face-to-face teaching supported by online
   resources was popular. Focus groups indicated the need for statistical
   training early in their degree and highlighted their lack of confidence
   and inconsistencies in support.
   Conclusion The study found that the students see the importance of
   statistics training in the medical curriculum but that timing and mode
   of delivery are key. The findings have informed the design of a new
   course to be implemented in the third undergraduate year. Teaching will
   be based around published studies aiming to equip students with the
   basics required with additional resources available through a virtual
   learning environment.}},

Title = {{Red blood cell storage duration is not associated with clinical outcomes
   for acute chest syndrome in children with sickle cell disease}},
Journal = {{TRANSFUSION}},

Volume = {{55}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Providers commonly transfuse sickle cell disease (SCD)
   patients with fresh red blood cells (RBCs) as treatment for acute chest
   syndrome (ACS). The objective of this study was to determine if there is
   an association between the storage duration of RBCs and length of
   hospitalization and oxygen requirement after transfusion in pediatric
   SCD patients with ACS.
   STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS This is a retrospective cohort study of
   pediatric SCD patients with ACS treated with a simple RBC transfusion
   over 8.5 years at a single institution. Multivariate generalized
   estimation equation analysis was used to identify associations between
   storage duration of RBCs and outcome measures.
   RESULTS A total of 234 ACS episodes in 131 subjects were included. The
   median storage duration of the oldest unit of transfused RBCs was 17
   days (interquartile range, 11-26). The majority of ACS episodes, 77.4\%,
   were treated with 1 unit of transfused RBCs; 20.9\% received 2 units;
   and 1.7\% received 3 or more units of RBCs. There was no association
   between the storage duration of the oldest unit of transfused RBCs and
   either duration of hospitalization or supplemental oxygen requirement
   after transfusion in multivariate analyses.
   CONCLUSION This retrospective study is one of the first to investigate
   the role of the storage lesion in children with SCD and does not support
   the preferential transfusion of fresh RBCs for ACS. Ultimately, a
   randomized controlled trial is necessary to determine whether the
   storage age of RBCs affects outcomes for patients with SCD and ACS.}},

Title = {{Anhedonia in pigs? Effects of social stress and restraint stress on
   sucrose preference}},
Journal = {{PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{151}},
Pages = {{509-515}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{The fact that consumption of normally palatable foods is affected by
   stress in both humans and rats suggests a means to assess hedonic
   reaction in non-verbal animals. However, little is known about anhedonia
   and stress in productive animals such as pigs. Thus we examined the
   separate effects of social stress and restraint stress in 42-day old
   pigs on the preference for dilute sucrose solutions over water. Pigs in
   the social stress group (SS) were mixed with unfamiliar animals from
   separate pens for two 20 minute periods (Experiment 1). Pigs in the
   restraint stress group (RS) were immobilized three times a day, for
   3-min periods, on 3 consecutive days (Experiment 2). Consumption of
   dilute sucrose solutions and water was examined after these stress
   manipulations and in the unstressed control groups (CG). Pigs were
   tested in pairs (12 control and 12 experimental) with a choice between
   water and sucrose solutions (at either 0.5\% or 1\%) during 30 min
   sessions. In both experiments CG pigs showed higher intakes of 0.5\% and
   1\% sucrose solutions over water. Neither SS nor RS pigs consumed more
   0.5\% sucrose than water, but both groups did consume more 1\% sucrose
   than water. Both social stress and restraint stress reduced sucrose
   preference at low concentrations but not at higher concentrations
   suggesting that stress may limit food consumption in pigs unless a
   palatable feed is present. In addition, the results suggest that stress
   reduces the hedonic impact of dilute sucrose. Therefore, sucrose
   preference may be a useful test for the presence of stress and anhedonia
   in pigs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of 17 beta-oestradiol
   (E2) on cartilage thickness and cytokine levels in the temporomandibular
   joint (TMJ). Thirty rats (15 female, 15 male) were orchidectomized
   (ORX), ovariectomized (OVX), or sham-operated. After 21 days, animals
   were assigned to six groups: (1) sham-ORX; (2) ORX; (3) ORX+E2; (4)
   sham-OVX; (5) OVX; and (6) OVX+E2. Treatments were administered daily
   for 21 days. The thickness of cartilage layers (fibrous, proliferative,
   maturation, and hypertrophic) and cytokine levels (interleukins IL-1
   alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha))
   were measured by histomorphometry and ELISA, respectively.
   Kruskal-Wallis/Durm's tests were used (alpha = 5\%). Sham-ORX showed
   thicker layers than ORX+E2, but not thicker than ORX. All layers, except
   the hypertrophic layer, were thicker in sham-OVX than OVX or OVX+E2.
   Although IL-1 beta levels were higher in castrated animals, E2 did not
   affect the level of this cytokine. IL-1 alpha levels were higher in both
   ORX (P = 0.0010) and ORX+E2 (P = 0.0053) than in sham-ORX. However, E2
   decreased IL-1 alpha levels in OVX (P = 0.0129). When compared to
   sham-ORX/OVX, IL-6 levels were not affected by E2 in males but were
   reduced in OVX (P = 0.0079) and increased in OVX+E2 (P = 0.0434). Levels
   of TNF-alpha were reduced by E2 in both ORX+E2 and OVX+E2. E2 treatment
   caused gender- and layer-dependent changes in the cartilage. Castration
   increased all cytokine levels, except for IL-6, without respect to
   gender.}},

Abstract = {{A 3D gravity model was developed in the western Gulf of Mexico in the
   East Breaks and Alaminos Canyon protraction areas. This model integrated
   3D seismic, gravity, and well data; it was constructed in support of a
   proprietary seismic reprocessing project and was updated iteratively
   with seismic. The gravity model was built from seismic horizons of the
   bathymetry, salt layers, and the acoustic basement; however, the latter
   was only possible to map in seismic data during the latest iterations.
   In addition, a deep layer representing the Moho boundary was derived
   from gravity and constrained by public-domain refraction data. A 3D
   density distribution was derived from the seismic velocity volume using
   a modified Gardner equation. The modification comprised imposing a depth
   dependency on the Gardner coefficient, which is constant in the classic
   Gardner equation. The modified coefficient was derived from well data in
   the study area and public-domain velocity-density data sets. The
   forward-calculated gravity response of the composed density model was
   then compared with the observed gravity field, and the mismatch was
   analyzed jointly by a seismic interpreter and a gravity modeler.
   Adjustments were then made to the gravity model to ensure that the
   resultant salt model was geologically reasonable and supported by
   gravity, seismic, and well data sets. The output of the gravity modeling
   was subsequently applied to the next phase of seismic processing.
   Overall, this integration resulted in a more robust salt model, which
   has led to significant improvements in subsalt seismic imaging. The
   analysis of the regional trend in the observed gravity field suggested
   that a stretched continental crust underlay our seismic reprocessing
   area, with an oceanic-continental transition zone located to the
   southeast of our reprocessing region.}},

Abstract = {{The full impact of a maternal death includes consequences faced by
   orphaned children. This analysis adds evidence to a literature on the
   magnitude of the association between a woman's death during or shortly
   after childbirth, and survival outcomes for her children.
   The Ifakara and Rufiji Health and Demographic Surveillance Sites in
   rural Tanzania conduct longitudinal, frequent data collection of key
   demographic events at the household level. Using a subset of the data
   from these sites (1996-2012), this survival analysis compared outcomes
   for children who experienced a maternal death (42 and 365 days
   definitions) during or near birth to those children whose mothers
   survived.
   There were 111 maternal deaths (or 229 late maternal deaths) during the
   study period, and 46.28 \% of the index children also subsequently died
   (40.73 \% of children in the late maternal death group) before their
   tenth birthday-a much higher prevalence of child mortality than in the
   population of children whose mothers survived (7.88 \%, p value <
   0.001). Children orphaned by early maternal deaths had a 51.54 \% chance
   of surviving to their first birthday, compared to a 94.42 \% probability
   for children of surviving mothers. A significant, but lesser, child
   survival effect was also found for paternal deaths in this study period.
   The death of a mother compromises the survival of index children.
   Reducing maternal mortality through improved health care-especially
   provision of high-quality skilled birth attendance, emergency obstetric
   services and neonatal care-will also help save children's lives.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Across the U.S. Veterans Affairs health care system, there have been
   programmatic initiatives to implement evidence-based psychotherapies
   (EBPs) for posttraumatic stress disorder, such as Cognitive Processing
   Therapy (CPT) and Prolonged Exposure (PE) (Chard, Ricksecker, Healy,
   Karlin, \& Resick, 2012). Several thousand clinicians have been trained,
   which makes these manualized treatments some of the most widespread and
   influential clinical training tools in the country. This article
   contends that these approaches are inadequate in responding to what is
   arguably the most important impact of military trauma: an enduring sense
   of guilt, remorse, and regret. A dialogue from the CPT training manual
   is highlighted as an example of how a therapist's assumptions about,
   inattention to, or underestimation of clients' moral horizons can cause
   harm. The author situates this critique in a broader discussion of some
   of the ways that psychology in general has dismissed guilt by divorcing
   it from the traditional contexts and value systems that give it meaning.
   This includes the cognitive-behavioral propagation of guilt as the
   byproduct of an irrational and unhelpful cognitive style, and recent
   research on moral injury conceptualization and treatment.}},

   into the mechanisms of aflibercept's antiangiogenic action.
   Additionally, we predict the plasma and tissue concentrations of unbound

Abstract = {{There is increasing recognition in medicine of the importance of
   noncognitive factors, including personality, for performance, and for
   good medical practice. The personality domain of conscientiousness is a
   well-established predictor of performance in workplace and academic
   settings. This study investigates the relationships between the ``Big
   Five{''} personality domains, the facets of conscientiousness and
   performance in a practical anatomy examination. First- and second-year
   undergraduate medical students (n=85) completed a paper-based
   questionnaire, which included a 50-item measure of the Big Five
   personality domains (neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience,
   agreeableness, and conscientiousness) and a 60-item measure of the six
   conscientiousness facets (orderliness, dutifulness,
   achievement-striving, self-discipline, self-efficacy, and cautiousness)
   from the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP). In addition,
   routinely-collected academic performance scores from the end of semester
   anatomy practical examinations (spotters) were obtained. Anatomy
   examination performance correlated moderately with conscientiousness
   (r=0.24, P=0.03). Of the six facets of conscientiousness, a positive
   relationship was observed between anatomy examination performance and
   achievement striving (r=0.22, P=0.05). In conclusion, this study found
   that performance in an anatomy examination was related to higher levels
   of conscientiousness and, more specifically, to higher levels of
   achievement striving. The results have implications for selection and
   assessment in medicine. Anat Sci Educ 8: 547-554. (c) 2015 American

Abstract = {{For many membrane proteins, the determination of their topology remains
   a challenge for methods like X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic
   resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)
   spectroscopy has evolved as an alternative technique to study structure
   and dynamics of membrane proteins. The present study demonstrates the
   feasibility of membrane protein topology determination using limited EPR
   distance and accessibility measurements. The BCL::MP-Fold (BioChemical
   Library membrane protein fold) algorithm assembles secondary structure
   elements (SSEs) in the membrane using a Monte Carlo Metropolis (MCM)
   approach. Sampled models are evaluated using knowledge-based potential
   functions and agreement with the EPR data and a knowledge-based energy
   function. Twenty-nine membrane proteins of up to 696 residues are used
   to test the algorithm. The RMSD100 value of the most accurate model is
   better than 8 angstrom for 27, better than 6 angstrom for 22, and better
   than 4 angstrom for 15 of the 29 proteins, demonstrating the algorithms'
   ability to sample the native topology. The average enrichment could be
   improved from 1.3 to 2.5, showing the improved discrimination power by
   using EPR data. Proteins 2015; 83:1947-1962. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals,

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{860-863}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The original aim of prophylactic replacement therapy was to convert the
   bleeding pattern of severe hemophilia to that of moderate hemophilia
   through regular infusions of clotting factor concentrates. However,
   targeting prophylaxis on minimum trough levels does not prevent all
   bleeding. At the group level, there is a clear association of factor
   levels with bleeding and outcome. But bleeding phenotype in individual
   patients shows large variation, independent of trough levels maintained.
   The association of peak levels with bleeding on prophylaxis is not
   established. Experience with surgery suggests that certain peak levels
   need to be achieved during other hemostatic challenges, such as playing
   sports. Individualization of prophylaxis should include timing of
   infusion according to special activities. The clinical relevance of
   factor levels is even more urgent since the recent introduction of
   long-acting clotting factor concentrates with their different
   pharmacokinetic profiles and the prospect of gene therapy resulting in
   constant factor levels. It should be considered that the success of any
   prophylactic regimen is also dependent on other factors, such as the age
   at initiation of prophylaxis, adherence, lifestyle, cartilage
   susceptibility, and the other components of the clotting system. Factor
   levels are thus an important but quite small piece in the total picture
   of treating hemophilia and we currently cannot identify a specific
   trough or peak level to use for monitoring. At the same time, knowledge
   of a patients' level during the infusion intervals may help to
   individualize and adjust treatment according to the clinical symptoms.}},

   prevalence of anemia was 42.9\%. Poor compliance with iron
   supplementation was significantly associated with increased risk of
   anemia (OR=4.250; 95\%CI: 1.425-12.671). This study implies the
   importance of enhancing the quality of ANC counselling to improve
   utilization of iron supplements and prevent anemia among pregnant women.}},

Abstract = {{The General Medical Council encourages the integration of complementary
   and alternative medicine (CAM) teaching into basic medical education. We
   wished to explore the attitudes of medical students to CAM and its
   inclusion in their undergraduate curriculum. Medical students were
   invited to complete the validated Integrative Medicine Attitude
   Questionnaire (IMAQ) and to state whether they considered it appropriate
   for them to learn about CAM in medical school. The questionnaire was
   completed by 308 students (65.8\% response rate). CAM had been received
   by a majority of respondents and their families. Participants believed
   that doctors with knowledge of CAM provide better patient care and that
   it is desirable for physicians to exploit the placebo effect. Most
   students expressed the view that doctors should be able to answer
   patients' questions about herbal medicines. There was a belief that
   patients should be warned to avoid using supplements which have not
   undergone rigorous testing. Students who were current or previous users
   of CAM or whose family members used CAM had higher total IMAQ scores and
   openness subscale scores than those who did not report use of CAM.
   Two-hundred and nine (68\%) students expressed a desire to study CAM as
   part of their medical curriculum. This study reveals a positive attitude
   towards a holistic approach to patient care which embraces CAM. Medical
   students believe that integrative medicine should be taught in medical
   school.}},

Abstract = {{This article contextualizes the Old English term sundorhalgan,
   `Pharisees', in the lexical process of loan rendition, the proclivities
   of the school at Winchester, and their particular use of Isidore's
   Etymologies. After plotting all the various ways by which Old English
   authors translate the Latin pharisaei, I demonstrate the limited circle
   of texts which use the term sundorhalgan rather than adopting the Latin
   as a loanword. These sundorhalgan-texts-all from the end of the Old
   English period-are dominated by the anonymous West Saxon Gospels and the
   homilies of AElfric. Based on a close reading of AElfric's pointed use
   and suppression of this term in his homilies, combined with its
   Isidorian basis, I argue that AElfric, or more broadly the school of
   Winchester, is the likeliest origin for the popularisation this term.}},

Abstract = {{Fatty acid and retinol-binding proteins (FARs) comprise a family of
   unusual alpha-helix rich lipid-binding proteins found exclusively in
   nematodes. They are secreted into host tissues by parasites of plants,
   animals and humans. The structure of a FAR protein from the free-living
   nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is available, but this protein {[}C.
   elegans FAR-7 (Ce-FAR-7)] is from a subfamily of FARs that does not
   appear to be important at the host/parasite interface. We have therefore
   examined {[}Necator americanus FAR-1 (Na-FAR-1)] from the blood-feeding
   intestinal parasite of humans, N. americanus. The 3D structure of
   Na-FAR-1 in its ligand-free and ligand-bound forms, determined by
   NMR(nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography
   respectively, reveals an alpha-helical fold similar to Ce-FAR-7, but
   Na-FAR-1 possesses a larger and more complex internal ligand-binding
   cavity and an additional C-terminal alpha-helix. Titration of
   apo-Na-FAR-1 with oleic acid, analysed by NMR chemical shift
   perturbation, reveals that at least four distinct protein-ligand
   complexes can be formed. Na-FAR-1 and possibly other FARs may have a
   wider repertoire for hydrophobic ligand binding, as confirmed in the
   present study by our finding that a range of neutral and polar lipids
   co-purify with the bacterially expressed recombinant protein. Finally,
   we show by immunohistochemistry that Na-FAR-1 is present in adult worms
   with a tissue distribution indicative of possible roles in nutrient
   acquisition by the parasite and in reproduction in the male.}},

Abstract = {{Iron (Fe) deficiency remains a public health problem. Deficiency is
   often due to low iron intake and/or iron bioavailability. Seaweeds are
   known to be rich in iron, but its bioavailability is poorly understood.
   Our objective was to evaluate common, edible seaweeds from Asia, Hawaii,
   and Maine as sources of iron by comparing iron content and
   bioavailability to spinach. Ten of 13 seaweeds analyzed contained more
   iron than spinach. Iron content ranged from 73 to 3490 mu g/g dry matter
   (DM). Twenty percent of the Daily Value for iron could be obtained from
   just 4.3 g of dry sea lettuce, 5.1 g of dry rockweed, 9 g of dry wakame,
   or 13 g of dry non. However, in vitro bioavailability studies indicated
   that, due to low absorption efficiencies, not all seaweeds would provide
   greater amounts of bioavailable Fe than spinach. Notable exceptions were
   nori and sea lettuce which provided 3 and 5-fold more bioavailable Fe,
   respectively. In addition, bioavailability was significantly enhanced by
   vitamin C in these two seaweeds. We conclude that certain seaweeds could
   be good sources of bioavailable iron. However, many seaweeds contained
   high levels of arsenic or other minerals which could limit regular
   consumption as a safe source of iron. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The composition and concentration of substances in urban effluents are
   complex and difficult to measure. These contaminants elicit biological
   responses in the exposed organisms. Proteomic analysis is a powerful
   tool in environmental toxicology by evidencing alterations in protein
   expression due to exposure to contaminants and by providing a useful
   framework for the development of new potential biomarkers. The aim of
   this study was to determine changes in protein expression signatures
   (PES) in the digestive gland of oysters Crassostrea gigas transplanted
   to two farming areas (LIS and RIB) and to one area contaminated by
   sanitary sewage (BUC) after 14 days of exposure. This species is one of
   the most cultivated molluscs in the world. The identified proteins are
   related to the cytoskeleton (CKAP5 and ACT2), ubiquitination pathway
   conjugation (UBE3C), G protein-coupled receptor and signal transduction
   (SVEP1), and cell cycle/division (CCNB3). CKAP5 showed higher expression
   in oysters kept at BUC in comparison with those kept at the farming
   areas, while ACT2, UBE3C, SVEP1, and CCNB3 were suppressed. The results
   suggest that these changes might lead to DNA damage, apoptosis, and
   interference with the immune system in oyster C. gigas exposed to sewage
   and give initial information on PES of C. gigas exposed to sanitary
   sewage, which can subsequently be useful in the development of more
   sensitive tools for biomonitoring coastal areas, particularly those
   devoted mainly to oyster farming activities.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Serum creatinine (SCr) alone does not allow for the early
   diagnosis of delayed graft function (DGF) following kidney
   transplantation (KTx).
   Objective, design and methods: The diagnostic utility of urinary
   neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (uNGAL), serum leptin,
   malondialdehyde (MD.A), and cystatin C (CysC) for the early detection of
   DGF was previously evaluated by our group in a prospective cohort study
   of 40 consecutive adults undergoing KTx. Because no single biomarker
   achieved adequate sensitivity or specificity for practical purposes,
   this study was designed to evaluate the combined use of new markers with
   SCr. Urine and blood samples were collected 8-to-12 h after KTx (day-1).
   Logistic regression was used to combine the biomarkers, and receiver
   operating characteristic curves and areas under the curve (AUC-ROC) were
   generated.
   Results: Eighteen recipients developed DGF (dialysis requirement during
   the first post-transplant week). On day-1, the AUC for SCr to predict
   DGF was 0.73, 0.88 for uNGAL, 0.90 for MDA, 0.76 for leptin, and 0.91
   for CysC. Adding new biomarkers to SCr enhanced the performance of DGF
   prediction, and the best combination was achieved with SCr, MDA, and
   CysC (AUC = 0.96, sensitivity = 100\%; specificity = 86\%).
   Conclusion: A combination of graft damage biomarkers outperformed SCr in
   the early diagnosis of DGF, and the best performance was achieved by a
   triple-marker approach, using SCr, MDA, and CysC. (C) 2015 The Canadian

Abstract = {{Introduction: Sevoflurane and isoflurane are anesthetics that cause
   muscle relaxation and potentiate the effects of neuromuscular blocking
   agents. Their presynaptic mechanisms of action are not understood
   completely, especially at the motor nerve terminal. Methods: We compared
   the presynaptic effects of these anesthetics on the exocytosis of
   synaptic vesicles labeled with the dye FM1-43 at the mouse neuromuscular
   junction. Results: Neither anesthetic evoked spontaneous exocytosis of
   synaptic vesicles, but both significantly inhibited the depolarization
   evoked by 4-aminopyridine and veratridine, suggesting a putative action
   on sodium channels. Exocytosis evoked by veratridine was inhibited by
   tetrodotoxin alone or in conjunction with sevoflurane or isoflurane,
   indicating that both agents may target voltage-gated sodium channels.
   Conclusions: We suggest that sevoflurane and isoflurane inhibit
   exocytosis evoked by sodium-dependent depolarization and might act on
   tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium channels. These findings contribute to a
   better understanding of some clinical neuromuscular effects induced by
   these anesthetics. Muscle Nerve52: 876-884, 2015}},

   considered an inherently random process due to the complex inhomogeneous
   system composition and its sensitivity to changes in pressure,

   Mach-Zehnder interferometer was used to collect phase fluctuations in
   the temporal domain introduced to an optical beam propagating through
   the atmosphere. The recorded phase fluctuations were converted into bit
   streams that were further analyzed in order to search for evidence of
   randomness. Empirical data and results that characterize the degree of
   randomness produced in the temporal phase component of an optical wave
   propagating through the atmosphere are presented. (C) 2015 Optical

   the Kretschmann prism coupling configuration in which an input beam

Abstract = {{The Symptoms of Trauma Scale (SOTS) is a 12-item, interview-based,
   clinician-rated measure that assesses the severity of a range of
   trauma-related symptoms. This pilot study evaluated its use and
   psychometric properties in an outpatient setting that provides treatment
   to survivors of chronic interpersonal trauma. Thirty participants
   completed self-report measures of posttraumatic stress symptoms,
   depression, dissociation, self-esteem, and affect dysregulation; the
   participants also participated separately in a semistructured interview
   based on the SOTS conducted by 2 trained interviewers. SOTS composite
   severity scores for DSM-IV posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and
   complex PTSD (cPTSD), DSM-5 PTSD, and PTSD dissociative subtype, and
   total traumatic stress symptoms generally had acceptable internal
   consistency and interrater reliability. Evidence of convergent,
   discriminant, criterion, and construct validity was found for the SOTS
   composite PTSD scores, although potential limitations to validity that
   require further research and refinement of the measure were identified
   for the SOTS total and DSM-IV cPTSD scores and the hyperarousal, affect
   dysregulation, and dissociation items. Interviewers and interviewees
   described the interview as efficient, informative, and well tolerated.
   Implications for clinical practice and research to refine the SOTS are

   explore how research from other disciplines can inform our understanding

   less general and more applicable to areas experiencing conflict than
   those currently supported by the business and peace literature. Based on
   literature reviews in political science, economics, and peace and
   conflict studies, we find support for an alternative conceptualization
   to the conflict/post-conflict classification that we term the
   ``buffer{''} condition. We suggest that existing research supports the
   proposition that the private sector is the most effective actor in
   promoting peace in areas experiencing the buffer condition. And we
   encourage researchers to investigate the most effective ways for

Abstract = {{We present a new catalog of spectrophotometric distances and line of
   sight systemic velocities to 103 H II regions between 90 degrees <= l <=
   195 degrees (longitude quadrants II and part of III). Two new velocities
   for each region are independently measured using 1 arcmin resolution 21
   cm H I and 2.6 mm (CO)-C-12 line maps (from the Canadian Galactic Plane
   Survey and Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory Outer Galaxy
   Surveys) that show where gaseous shells are observed around the
   periphery of the ionized gas. Known and neighboring O-and B-type stars
   with published UBV photometry and MK classifications are overlaid onto
   21 cm continuum maps, and those stars observed within the boundary of
   the H II emission (and whose distance is not more than three times the
   standard deviation of the others) are used to calculate new mean stellar
   distances to each of the 103 nebulae. Using this approach of excluding
   distance outliers from the mean distance to a group of many stars in
   each H II region lessens the impact of anomalous reddening for certain
   individuals. The standard deviation of individual stellar distances in a
   cluster is typically 20\% per stellar distance, and the error in the
   mean distance to the cluster is typically +/- 10\%. Final mean distances
   of nine common objects with very long baseline interferometry parallax
   distances show a 1:1 correspondence. Further, comparison with previous
   catalogs of H II regions in these quadrants shows a 50\% reduction in
   scatter for the distance to Perseus spiral arm objects in the same
   region, and a reduction by similar to 1/root 2 in scatter around a
   common angular velocity relative to the Sun Omega - Omega(0)(km s(-1)
   kpc(-1)). The purpose of the catalog is to provide a foundation for more
   detailed large-scale Galactic spiral structure and dynamics (rotation
   curve, density wave streaming) studies in the 2nd and 3rd quadrants,
   which from the Sun's location is the most favorably viewed section of
   the Galaxy.}},

   and gang members danced. In the process, though, they also captured New
   York in the midst of urban renewal. The broad international distribution
   of the film spread an image of urban life that conveyed the abstract,
   aerial views of urban planners such as Robert Moses alongside the
   dynamic, street-level action of Jane Jacobs. While the filmmakers did
   not make pronouncements about urban theories, they visualized urban
   renewal in its grandeur and detail, animating cold concrete streets with
   dance and pitting vitality against human tragedy at the core of urban
   life.}},

Abstract = {{Lenalidomide is manageable and effective in multiple myeloma,
   particularly in elderly patients. Surprisingly, the combination of
   lenalidomide with rituximab produced clinically significant anemia at 25
   mg/day for 21/28 days, the highest possible dose, in Waldenstrom's
   Macroglobulinemia (WM). We aimed to determine the maximum tolerated dose
   (MTD) of single agent lenalidomide and determine its impact on WM.
   RV-WM-0426 is a multicenter dose escalation open label phase 1/2 study
   of lenalidomide in relapsed/refractory WM (RRWM). Lenalidomide was given
   orally 21/28 days per cycle for 1 year, at escalated dose of 15 to 20 mg
   during phase 1 to determine the MTD; the phase 2 part was conducted at
   the MTD. Seventeen RRWM patients were included. The MTD was established
   at 15 mg/day 21/28. By ITT analysis, the overall response rate was 29\%.
   With a median follow-up of 36 months, median TTP was 16 months (95\% CI
   5.5-26), the 5-year OS was 91\%. The most frequent adverse eventsgrade 3
   at 15 mg were 14\% anemia and 43\% neutropenia. The MTD of lenalidomide
   is 15 mg/day 21/28 days in RRWM. Lenalidomide is active in the treatment
   of RRWM and the safety profile appears manageable. Future studies may
   look into combinations of lenalidomide and continuous dosing. Am. J.

Abstract = {{Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the main risk factor of
   morbidity and mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients.
   Insulin resistance (IR) has been reported to be a strong risk factor for
   CVD. The purpose of this study was to examine the usefulness of IR as a
   predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and end-stage renal disease
   (ESRD).
   Methods: We followed during a period of 56 months 119 type 2 diabetic
   CKD patients (stages 2 to 4) without history of CVD at the beginning of
   the study. Several laboratory parameters and left ventricular mass index
   (LVMI) were analyzed. The degree of IR was estimated by the Homeostasis
   Model Assessment (HOMA-IR). Cardiovascular morbidity was assessed
   according to the presence of cardiovascular hospital admission during
   the study period, defined by admissions caused by coronary heart
   disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease and
   cerebrovascular disease. The population was divided in two groups: G-1
   with cardiovascular admission (n = 48) and G-2: without admission (n =
   71). The multiple logistic regression was used to assess predictors of
   cardiovascular morbidity and ESRD. The renal survival was evaluated by
   the Kaplan-Meier and long-rank test.
   Results: We found that G-1 patients showed significantly higher HOMA-IR
   (3.8 vs 0.77, p = 0.0001) and that HOMA-IR upper tercile showed
   significantly higher age, eGFR, LVMI, phosphorus, iPTH and IL-6. In a
   multivariate logistic regression model HOMA-IR and IL-6 were independent
   risk factors of cardiovascular morbidity (OR = 2.847 {[}95\% CI
   1.048-7.735, p = 0.012] and OR = 2.483 {[}95\% CI 1.221-5.049, p =
   0.04], respectively). In a univariate logistic regression model patients
   in the upper tercile presented significantly more cardiovascular
   admissions that in the lower tercile. CKD progression to ESRD was
   observed in 24 patients and those in the upper HOMA-IR tercile showed a
   higher CKD progression to ESRD than the rest of study patients. A
   multivariate logistic regression model showed that HOMA-IR (OR = 1.034,
   95\% Cl (1.005-1.650) p = 0.040) was an independent predictor of ESRD.
   Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a difference in renal survival in the
   HOMA-IR terciles (log rank = 8.093; p = 0.017).
   Conclusion: In our study IR is an important risk factor for
   cardiovascular morbidity and ESRD in a diabetic CKD population. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Kuikuro, a dialect of a Southern Karib language, shows a complex left
   periphery of the utterance (Rizzi, 1997), the layer of the syntactic
   structure in interface with the pragmatics of the utterance. In
   Franchetto \& Santos (2010), distinct functional projections in the
   Force-Finitude System (expanded Complementizer Phrase) have been
   described, including FocP (Focus Phrase). This article describes and
   analyses, specifically, the Kuikuro FocP in the realm of the syntax of
   the information structure. An active left periphery characterizes most
   of the Kuikuro utterances: just one constituents and no more than one,
   moves to FocP, followed by a deictic and a non-verbal copula. Focus
   constructions have the same structure of interrogative and relative
   constructions. The deictics have tense values showing the crucial
   interaction between Focus and Finitude in a language where the verb is
   inflected only for aspects without any distinction between finite and
   non-finite form. The conclusive analysis of Kuikuro Focus constructions
   follows that done by Puglielli e Frascarelli (n. d.) of the
   ForceFinitude System in Avar and Somali: an active FocP has a crucial
   role in the interpretation of other syntactic and pragmatic categories.
   I propose that in Kuikuro the Focus marker (MF) is a copular form, as in
   Avar and Somali, implying the presence of a Small Clause in Focus
   constructions.}},

   of the patient and their recovery. In contrast, some studies show that
   fasting abbreviation can improve the response to trauma and decrease the
   length of hospital stay. Aim: Investigate whether the prescribed
   perioperative fasting time and practiced by patients is in compliance
   with current multimodal protocols and identify the main factors
   associated. Methods: Crosssectional study with 65 patients undergoing
   elective surgery of the digestive tract or abdominal wall. We
   investigated the fasting time in the perioperative period, hunger and
   thirst reports, physical status, diabetes diagnosis, type of surgery and
   anesthesia. Results: The patients were between 19 and 87 years, mostly
   female (73.8\%). The most performed procedure was cholecystectomy
   (47.69\%) and general anesthesia the most used (89.23\%). The most
   common approach was to start fasting from midnight for liquids and
   solids, and most of the patients received grade II (64.6\%) to the
   physical state. The real fasting average time was 16 h (9.5-41.58) was
   higher than prescribed (11 h, 6.58 -26.75). The patients submitted to
   surgery in the afternoon were in more fasting time than those who did in
   the morning (p<0.001). The intensity of hunger and thirst increased in
   postoperative fasting period (p=0.010 and 0.027). The average period of
   postoperative fasting was 18.25 h (3.33-91.83) and only 23.07\%
   restarted feeding on the same day. Conclusion: Patients were fasted for
   prolonged time, higher even than the prescribed time and intensity of
   the signs of discomfort such as hunger and thirst increased over time.
   To better recovery and the patient's well-being, it is necessary to
   establish a preoperative fasting abbreviation protocol.}},

Abstract = {{ln this work we studied the optical band-gap and dielectric properties
   of nanoparticulate powders of Co-doped ZnO with x=0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, 5,
   7 and 9.0 at \%Co synthesized by the combustion reaction method. X-ray
   diffraction patterns (XRD) of each sample showed broad peaks consistent
   with the ZnO wurtzite structure. The absence of extra reflections in the
   diffraction patterns ensures the phase purity. The average crystallite
   size determined from the most prominent (101) peak of the diffraction
   using Scherrer's equation was in good agreement with those determined by
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), being similar to 16 nm for
   undoped-ZnO sample and similar to 21 nm for all Co-doped samples.
   Diffuse reflectance spectrum of each sample was obtained by using a
   UV/VIS/Near spectrometer and the optical band-gap E-g decreased with Co
   doping amount. The dielectric constant epsilon was determined using the
   Brus model (L.E. Brus, J. Chem. Phys. 80 (1984) 4403 {[}38]) increased
   with Co doping amount, reaching the maximum value of similar to 10 for
   x=1.0 at \%Co. These results were discussed in terms of the defects such
   as oxygen vacancies V-O or/and interstitial oxygen O-i(v) present in
   Co-doped ZnO nanoparticles, which may be introduced during sample
   preparation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Graves' disease is caused by stimulating autoantibodies against the
   thyrotropin receptor inducing uncontrolled overproduction of thyroid
   hormones. A Bridge Assay is presented for direct detection of these
   thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins using thyrotropin receptor chimeras.
   A capture receptor, formed by replacing aa residues 261-370 of the human
   thyrotropin receptor with residues 261-329 from rat
   lutropin/choriogonadotropin receptor and fixed to microtiter plates,
   binds one arm of the autoantibody. The second arm bridges to the signal
   receptor constructed from thyrotropin receptor (aa21-261) and secretory
   alkaline phosphatase (aa1-519) inducing chemiluminescence. The working
   range of the assay is from 0.3IU/l to 50IU/l with a cutoff of 0.54IU/l
   and functional sensitivity of 0.3IU/l. Sensitivity and specificity are
   99.8 and 99.1\%, respectively, with a diagnostic accuracy of 0.998. The
   low grey zone is from 0.3-0.54IU/l. The stimulatory character of the
   assayed antibodies is shown through a good correlation (r=0.7079,
   p<10(-7)) to serum T4 levels of untreated patients. In Graves' disease,
   titers are increased in associated eye disease. In 3 hypothyroid
   patients with sera positive in the thyrotropin receptor competition
   assay and in the blocking bioassay, antibodies are not detected by the
   Bridge Assay, while the monoclonal blocking antibody K1-70 was detected.
   In Hashimoto disease thyrotropin receptor autoantibodies are detected in
   some patients, but not in goiter. This Bridge Assay delivers good
   diagnostic accuracy for identification of Graves' disease patients. Its
   high sensitivity may facilitate early detection of onset, remission, or
   recurrence of Graves' disease enabling timely adaption of the treatment.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{168}},

Abstract = {{Background: Cogent evidence has shown that schizophrenia vulnerability
   is enhanced by psychosocial stress in adolescence, yet the underpinnings
   of this phenomenon remain elusive. One of the animal models that best
   capture the relationship between juvenile stress and schizophrenia is
   isolation rearing (IR). This manipulation, which consists in subjecting
   rats to social isolation from weaning through adulthood, results in
   neurobehavioral alterations akin to those observed in schizophrenia
   patients. In particular, IR-subjected rats display a marked reduction of
   the prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle reflex, which are posited
   to reflect imbalances in dopamine neurotransmission in the nucleus
   accumbens (NAcc). We recently documented that the key neurosteroidogenic
   enzyme 5 alpha-reductase (5 alpha R) plays an important role in the
   dopaminergic regulation of PPI; given that IR leads to a marked
   down-regulation of this enzyme in the NAcc, the present study was
   designed to further elucidate the functional role of 5aR in the
   regulation of PPI of IR-subjected rats.
   Methods: We studied the impact of the prototypical 5aR inhibitor
   finasteride (FIN) on the PPI deficits and NAcc steroid profile of
   IR-subjected male rats, in comparison with socially reared (SR)
   controls.
   Results: FIN (25-100 mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently countered IR-induced
   PPI reduction, without affecting gating integrity in SR rats. The NAcc
   and striatum of IR-subjected rats displayed several changes in
   neuroactive steroid profile, including a reduction in pregnenolone in
   both SR and IR-subjected groups, as well as a decrease in
   allopregnanolone content in the latter group; both effects were
   significantly opposed by FIN.
   Conclusions: These results show that 5aR inhibition counters the PPI
   deficits induced by IR, possibly through limbic changes in pregnenolone
   and/or allopregnanolone concentrations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This analysis of the Atlanta test-cheating scandal differs markedly from
   the version reported in the press. Using discourse analysis, I examined
   over 50 articles published in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC),
   the hometown newspaper at the center of the investigation. Because
   newspapers are a primary source of information, the AJC's discursive
   framing of test-tampering and systemic wrongdoing was a powerful voice
   in shaping how the public understood what happened. But failure to
   situate the scandal in a context of economic deprivation and residential
   segregation while omitting discussion of the damaging cognitive and
   academic effects that stem from living in distressed neighborhoods meant
   the AJC depicted a misleading version of events. Although the school
   district has recovered, the inequalities which fomented the crisis
   remain intact. I revisit the Atlanta Compromise of 1973 to conclude that
   as in the past, a policy of schools alone is an insufficient corrective
   for educational disadvantage.}},

Abstract = {{Background: High on treatment platelet reactivity (HTPR) is common in
   patients receiving clopidogrel following an acute coronary syndrome
   (ACS); it's also associated with increased morbidity and mortality. More
   potent and predictable antiplatelet drugs have addressed this issue at
   the expense of increased bleeding. Identification of HTPR and the
   targeted use of more potent antiplatelet drugs has, so far, broadly
   failed. We investigate this approach in terms of the timing of platelet
   function testing and how this can impact on the ability of these bedside
   tests to predict HTPR around the time of coronary intervention.
   Methods: High risk ACS patients treated with 5 days of clopidogrel had
   platelet function assessed using the multiple electrode aggregometry
   system (MEA) pre, post and 24 h following percutaneous coronary
   intervention (PCI). Simultaneous detailed analysis of platelet status
   was undertaken with quantification of platelet bound and soluble
   p-selectin and mass spectrometry quantification of the eicosanoid
   12-HETE.
   Results: As assessed by MEA 40.5\% of patients had HTPR pre-PCI; mean
   aggregation units (AU) in response to ADP were 499.1 +/- 46.3 pre-PCI,
   407.6 +/- 37.7 post-PCI and 269.1 +/- 24.6 AU 24 h post-PCI (pre to post
   PCI p > 0.05, pre to 24 h post-PCI p = 0.0002). This highly significant
   drop in platelet reactivity was contrasted with on-going expression of
   platelet bound p-selectin, increased soluble p-selectin and rising
   12-HETE concentrations.
   Conclusions: This study outlines significant changes in ex-vivo platelet
   aggregation that occur within 24 h of PCI in high risk NSTEMI patients
   using bedside PFT. Whilst there were no changes in antiplatelet therapy
   during the study period its clear that timing is crucial when assessing
   high on treatment residual platelet activity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland

Abstract = {{Background. Cannabis use is decreasing in England and Wales, while
   demand for cannabis treatment in addiction services continues to rise.
   This could be partly due to an increased availability of high-potency
   cannabis.
   Method. Adults residing in the UK were questioned about their drug use,
   including three types of cannabis (high potency: skunk; low potency:
   other grass, resin). Cannabis types were profiled and examined for
   possible associations between frequency of use and (i) cannabis
   dependence, (ii) cannabis-related concerns.
   Results. Frequent use of high-potency cannabis predicted a greater
   severity of dependence {[}days of skunk use per month: b = 0.254, 95\%
   confidence interval (CI) 0.161-0.357, p < 0.001] and this effect became
   stronger as age decreased (b = -0.006, 95\% CI -0.010 to -0.002, p =
   0.004). By contrast, use of low-potency cannabis was not associated with
   dependence (days of other grass use per month: b = 0.020, 95\% CI -0.029
   to 0.070, p = 0.436; days of resin use per month: b = 0.025, 95\% CI
   -0.019 to 0.067, p = 0.245). Frequency of cannabis use (all types) did
   not predict severity of cannabis-related concerns. High-potency cannabis
   was clearly distinct from low-potency varieties by its marked effects on
   memory and paranoia. It also produced the best high, was preferred, and
   most available.
   Conclusions. High-potency cannabis use is associated with an increased
   severity of dependence, especially in young people. Its profile is
   strongly defined by negative effects (memory, paranoia), but also
   positive characteristics (best high, preferred type), which may be
   important when considering clinical or public health interventions
   focusing on cannabis potency.}},

   On light of new regulations on CO2, SOx and NOx, the options for clean

Abstract = {{Background Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is frequently used,
   but there are no data about current frequency regarding specific tumor
   sites and equipment used for quality assurance (QA).
   Materials and methods An online survey about IMRT was executed from
   April to October 2014 by the collaborative IMRT working group (AK IMRT)
   of the German Association of Medical Physicists (DGMP).
   Results A total of 23 German institutions took part in the survey. Most
   reports came from users working with Elekta, Varian, and Siemens
   treatment machines, but also from TomoTherapy and BrainLab. Most
   frequent IMRT technology was volumetric modulated arc therapy (58.37 \%:
   VMAT/{''}rapid arc{''}), followed by step-and-shoot IMRT (14.66 \%),
   dynamic MLC (dMLC: 14.53 \%), TomoTherapy (9.25 \%), and 3.2 \% other
   techniques. Different commercial hard- and software solutions are
   available for QA, whereas many institutes still develop their own
   phantoms. Data of 26,779 patients were included in the survey; 44 \%
   were treated using IMRT techniques. IMRT was most frequently used for
   anal cancer, (whole) craniospinal irradiation, head and neck cancer,
   prostate cancer, other tumors in the pelvic region, gynecological tumors
   (except for breast cancer), and brain tumors.
   Discussion An estimated 10 \% of all patients treated in 2014 with
   radiation in Germany were included in the survey. It is representative
   for the members of the AK IMRT.
   Conclusion IMRT may be on the way to replace other treatment techniques.
   However, many scientific questions are still open. In particular, it is
   unclear when the IMRT technique should not be used.}},

Volume = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To differentiate PCA segments and cortical branches by means of
   transcranial colorcoded duplex sonography (TCCD) and to measure flow
   parameters at rest and during visual stimulation.
   Materials and Methods: 60 healthy subjects with a good acoustic temporal
   bone window were examined. The main stem of the PCA (P1, P2 and P3) and
   4 main cortical branches - the anterior temporal artery (ATA), the
   occipital temporal artery (OTA), the parietooccipital artery (POA) and
   the calcarine artery (CA) - were assessed using an axial transtemporal
   approach. Systolic and diastolic blood flow velocities (BFVs) were
   recorded at rest and during visual stimulation.
   Results: Identification of the P1 segment of the PCA was successful in
   97.5 \% (117/120) of cases. The P2 and P3 segments were visualized in
   all cases. The 4 main cortical branches could be identified to varying
   degrees: ATA in 88 \%, OTA in 96 \%, POA in 69 \% and CA in 62 \%. There
   was an evoked flow response in the P2 main stem and in all cortical
   branches. The most pronounced increase in diastolic/systolic BFV after
   visual stimulation test was seen in the CA (42 \%/35 \%), followed by P2
   (30 \%/24 \%), the POA (27 \%/27 \%), the OTA (16 \%/13 \%) and the ATA
   (9 \%/8 \%).
   Conclusion: Insonation through the temporal bone window with TCCD
   confidently allows the assessment of the P1 to P3 segments of the PCA as
   well as the 2 proximal branches, the ATA and the OTA. An ultrasound-
   based classification of PCA anatomy and its cortical branches may be
   used as a noninvasive method for the evaluation of posterior circulation
   pathology.}},

Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{The reliability of an expert is an important concept in multiple
   attribute group decision analysis (MAGDA). However, reliability is
   rarely considered in MAGDA, or it may. be simply assumed that all
   experts are fully reliable and thus their reliabilities do not need to
   be considered explicitly. In fact, any experts can Only be bounded
   rational and their various degrees of reliabilities may significantly
   influence MAGDA results. In this paper, we propose a new method based on
   the evidential reasoning rule to explicitly measure the reliability of
   each expert in a group and use expert weights and reliabilities to
   combine expert assessments. Two sets of assessments, i.e., original
   assessments and updated assessments provided after group analysis and
   discussion are taken into account to measure expert reliabilities. When
   the assessments of some experts are incomplete while global ignorance is
   incurred, pairs of optimization problems are constructed to decide
   interval-valued expert reliabilities. The resulting expert reliabilities
   are applied to combine the expert assessments of alternatives on each
   attribute and then to generate the aggregated assessments of
   alternatives. An industry evaluation problem in Wuhu, a city in Anhui
   Province of China is analyzed by using the proposed method as a real
   case study to demonstrate its detailed implementation process, validity,
   and applicability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. and Association of European

Title = {{The interaction between ALKBH2 DNA repair enzyme and PCNA is direct,
   mediated by the hydrophobic pocket of PCNA and perturbed in
   naturally-occurring ALKBH2 variants}},
Journal = {{DNA REPAIR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{35}},
Pages = {{13-18}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Human AlkB homolog 2 (ALKBH2) is a DNA repair enzyme that catalyzes the
   direct reversal of DNA methylation damage through oxidative
   demethylation. While ALKBH2 colocalizes with proliferating cell nuclear
   antigen (PCNA) in DNA replication foci, it remains unknown whether these
   two proteins alone form a complex or require additional components for
   interaction. Here, we demonstrate that ALKBH2 can directly interact with
   PCNA independent from other cellular factors, and we identify the
   hydrophobic pocket of PCNA as the key domain mediating this interaction.
   Moreover, we find that PCNA association with ALKBH2 increases
   significantly during DNA replication, suggesting that ALKBH2 forms a
   cell-cycle dependent complex with PCNA. Intriguingly, we show that an
   ALKBH2 germline variant, as well as a variant found in cancer, display

Abstract = {{The rapid development of social network theory provides a new
   perspective for the research on counter-terrorism, however, current
   research mostly relates to terrorists and terrorist organizations.
   Firstly, the ``six-element{''} analysis method for terrorist activities
   based on social network is proposed in this paper, namely, a variety of
   sub-networks are constructed according to the correlation among the six
   elements-people, organization, time, location, manner and event. These
   sub-networks are assessed through using centrality analysis, cohesive
   subgroup analysis, spatial correlation analysis, invulnerability
   analysis and descriptive statistic analysis; the characteristics and
   laws of terrorist activities are revealed from several different
   perspectives. Then, the ``six-element{''} analysis method is applied to
   conduct empirical research on ``East Turkistan{''} terrorist activities
   since the founding of the People's Republic of China, so as to
   effectively identify core people and key organizations of the ``East
   Turkistan{''} terrorist activity network, to assess the invulnerability
   of the ``East Turkistan{''} terrorist network and to reveal the temporal
   and spatial distribution rules as well as the characteristics of the
   means and manners adopted in all previous terrorist activities. Lastly,
   the analysis results are interpreted qualitatively. This research can
   provide a basis for decision making and an analysis method for the
   identification of core terrorists and key terrorist organizations,
   determination of the key alert period, location of counter-terrorism and
   the early warning of the means of major terrorist activities.}},

Abstract = {{This paper first presents a novel dual-layer permanent-magnet
   (PM)-excited (DPME) synchronous motor in which an extra set of iron
   teeth is employed in an inner stator between the PM rotor and the shaft.
   It can provide additional variation of magnetic reluctance along the
   circumferential direction of the air gap, and the strength of the flux
   modulation among the magnetic fields produced by the armature windings
   and the PMs is improved. The proposed motor has tactfully integrated the
   two pairs of flux-modulated motors inside one frame with one shared set
   of armature windings. The advantage of the proposed DPME motor is that
   it offers much higher torque capability than its conventional
   counterparts, making it more competitive for low-speed high-torque
   applications. In this paper, a novel triple-layer PM-excited (TPME)
   synchronous motor is further presented with the similar operating
   principle of the DPME, and it has three PM layers inside the frame.
   Finite-element method of magnetic field with mechanical motion coupled
   computation is employed to evaluate the electromagnetic torque
   precisely, showcasing that the proposed DPME motor can output an extra
   37.5\% more torque compared with a conventional synchronous motor, and
   the proposed TPME motor can output an additional 70\% more torque with a
   similar power efficiency compared with the conventional PM synchronous
   motor.}},

Abstract = {{The present study aimed to determine whether the mitogen-activated
   protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway is involved in the
   osteoprotegerin (OPG)-mediated inhibition of osteoclast differentiation
   and maturation. RAW264.7 cells were incubated with macrophage
   colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of nuclear
   factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL) to stimulate osteoclastogenesis and
   treated with various concentrations of OPG, an inhibitor of osteoclast
   differentiation. The differentiation and activation of osteoclasts were
   monitored by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining and bone
   resorption assays. The phosphorylation levels of p38-MAPK, c-Jun
   N-terminal kinase (JNK)-MAPK and extracellular signal-regulated kinase
   (ERK)-MAPK in the different treatment groups were determined by western
   blot analysis. The results confirmed that M-CSF + RANKL stimulated the
   differentiation and activation of osteoclasts as well as the
   phosphorylation of p38-MAPK, JNK-MAPK and ERK-MAPK in osteoclasts, which
   was attenuated by OPG treatment. These findings indicated that the MAPK
   signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of osteoclastogenesis

Journal = {{COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{196}},
Pages = {{166-178}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In its most widespread, classical formulation, the Nernst-Planck-Poisson
   system for ion transport in electrolytes fails to take into account
   finite ion sizes. As a consequence, it predicts unphysically high ion
   concentrations near electrode surfaces. Historical and recent approaches
   to an appropriate modification of the model are able to fix this
   problem. Several appropriate formulations are compared in this paper.
   The resulting equations are reformulated using absolute activities as
   basic variables describing the species amounts. This reformulation
   allows to introduce a straightforward generalisation of the
   Scharfetter-Gummel finite volume discretisation scheme for
   drift-diffusion equations. It is shown that it is thermodynamically
   consistent in the sense that the solution of the corresponding
   discretised generalised Poisson-Boltzmann system describing the
   thermodynamical equilibrium is a stationary state of the discretised
   time-dependent generalised Nernst-Planck system. Numerical examples
   demonstrate the improved physical correctness of the generalised models
   and the feasibility of the numerical approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{48}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, new approaches are taken to explore two new dimensions of
   the oil growth nexus that are relevant when focusing on oil producing
   countries. Based on panel regressions, we regress per capita income on
   the ratio of oil production to primary energy consumption and oil rents
   per capita, adding control variables and exploring a relationship
   analysis within a multivariate oil-growth nexus framework. The per
   capita oil consumption-economic growth nexus is examined in a panel of
   oil producing countries over a long time span (1970-2012), controlling
   for the exports of goods and services, the ratio of oil production to
   primary energy consumption, the oil rents, and international crude oil
   prices. The phenomenon of cross-sectional dependence that is present in
   the panel confirms that these countries share common spatial patterns,
   unobserved common factors, or both. The cointegration/long memory
   relationships, as well as the panel data estimators' appropriateness,
   are both analysed and discussed. A dynamic Driscoll-Kraay estimator,
   with fixed effects, is shown to be adequate to cope with the phenomena
   of heteroskedasticity, contemporaneous correlation, first order
   autocorrelation and cross-sectional dependence, present in the panel.
   Oil consumption drives economic growth, but only on the short-run. The
   ratio of oil production to primary energy consumption has exerted a
   positive impact on growth in both the short-and long-run. Oil prices
   only exert a positive effect on growth in the short-run. Oil rents
   depress growth in both the short-and long-run, suggesting that it is
   more a curse than a blessing for the economies.}},

Abstract = {{{[}Purpose] The purpose of this study was to examine changes in vagal
   tone during passive exercise while supine. {[}Subjects and Methods]
   Eleven healthy males lay supine for 5 min and then performed passive
   cycling for 10 min using a passive cycling machine. The lower legs moved
   through a range of motion defined by 90 degrees and 180 degrees knee
   joint angles at 60 rpm. Respiratory rates were maintained at 0.25 Hz to
   elicit respiratory sinus arrhythmia. Heart rate variability was analyzed
   using the time domain analysis, as the root mean squared standard
   differences between adjacent R-R intervals (rMSSD), and spectrum domain
   analysis of the high frequency (HF) component. {[}Results] Compared to
   rest, passive cycling decreased rMSSD (rest, 66.6 +/- 92.6 ms; passive
   exercise, 53.5 +/- 32.5 ms). However, no significant changes in HR or HF
   were observed (rest, 68.2 +/- 6.9 bpm, 65.6 +/- 12.0 n.u.; passive
   exercise, 70.2 +/- 7.2 bpm, 67.9 +/- 10.0 n.u.). {[}Conclusion] These
   results suggest that passive exercise decreases rMMSD through
   supine-stimulated mechanoreceptors with no effect on HR or HF.
   Therefore, rMSSD is not affected by hydrostatic pressure during passive
   cycling in the supine position.}},

Abstract = {{Leishamaniasis is a parasitic disease transmitted by sandfly Phlebotomus
   spp. and is seen in tropical and subtropical countries in which an
   estimated 12 million persons are infected. Among various types of
   leishmaniasis, zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (ZVL) caused by
   Leishmania infantum is an important amphixenosis shared by human and
   other animals. Although identifying the natural reservoir host would
   help better understand the transmission dynamics of Leishmania spp.,
   little effort has been made to quantitatively clarify the dynamics
   involving the reservoir host of ZVL. The present study investigated the
   reservoir potential of four wild animals in maintaining ZVL, using
   prevalence data from Latin American countries in Amazons and examining
   the role of crab-eating fox, spiny rat, common opossum and black rat in
   maintaining the transmission. Reflecting frequent reinfections, a
   susceptible-infected-susceptible model was employed, enabling us to
   estimate model parameters from endemic prevalence data. The next
   generation matrix of the multi-host system was computed, permitting us
   to theoretically examine the reservoir potential of each animal species.
   Our estimates indicated that there is no unique reservoir host
   consisting of single animal species. Crab eating fox was considered to
   play an important role in maintaining L. infantum transmission, but this
   was the case only in combination with other hosts. The present study
   indicates that animal species other than canine play important roles in
   maintaining transmission of Leishmania infantum, which is different from
   conventional wisdom that centered on the importance of canine only.
   Greater sample size with additional entomological and genetic insights
   into inter-specific contact would be required to implement more explicit
   assessments.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of supraliminal primes on product preference have been
   explained by two activation mechanisms, goal activation and trait
   activation. In this research, an additional activation mechanism not
   explained by goals or traits is identified. Using the implicit
   association test as a process measure, this article provides evidence
   that the effect of supraliminal primes on product preference is the
   result of conceptual fluency and the fluency heuristic. To provide
   evidence that this mechanism affects preference nonconsciously, this
   article proposes a dual-processing framework where conscious effects are
   mediated by explicit attitude and nonconscious effects are mediated by
   implicit attitude and moderated by the motivation and opportunity to
   process information. The experimental findings support the authors'
   propositions, which provide a number of theoretical, methodological, and

Abstract = {{Sustainability is probably the ultimate goal of any entrepreneur when
   initiating or developing a business. As it involves competitiveness,
   companies aim to produce differentiated economic offerings by reusing
   and sharing processes, components, information and knowledge - many
   times from different domains. However, to be effective, this should be
   envisaged already when developing the entrepreneurial plan or when
   assessing the opportunity of extending the business - therefore the need
   for planning / implementing / integrating several business lines (from
   various domains). As many of them may look attractive, an effective
   decision of starting one business line or another should be supported by
   some tool that allows a systematic assessment of the opportunity of
   implementing them.
   This paper proposes an algorithm that supports entrepreneurs in this
   respect. The opportunity of developing new business lines is assessed by
   estimating the mutual impact between them and existing business lines,
   their impact on organizational performance, and additional indicators
   such as financial effort, the estimated return on investment, technical
   and organizational difficulty, risk level or domain financing
   opportunities. An application example is presented in which an SME in an
   interdisciplinary domain (covering IT and life-sciences) assesses the
   opportunity of opening two new business lines.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: The finding that migrants to high-income countries have
   lower rates of morbidity and mortality than non-migrants, controlling
   for socioeconomic position, is often attributed to the ``healthy
   migrant{''} hypothesis, which suggests that only the healthiest
   individuals choose to migrate. This prospective study investigates the
   healthy migrant hypothesis in a cohort of British emigrants using
   pre-migration health indicators. We also investigate how early-life
   health characteristics relate to age at emigration and whether or not
   the emigrant returned home.
   METHODS: Data are from the Medical Research Council National Survey of
   Health and Development, a nationally representative cohort study of
   people born in England, Scotland or Wales in March 1946. Childhood
   socio-economic position, health and cognitive ability were compared
   between 4,378 non-emigrants and 984 emigrants. Of the emigrants, 427
   emigrated before age 20 and 557 after that age; 602 emigrants remained
   abroad and 382 returned home.
   RESULTS: Emigrants had better childhood health (especially greater
   height), higher childhood socio-economic position and better childhood
   cognitive ability at age 8 than non-emigrants. Return emigrants were
   very similar to emigrants who remained abroad.
   CONCLUSIONS: We found support for the healthy migrant hypothesis in a
   cohort of British emigrants. Our findings improve an understanding of
   how health is distributed within and across nations.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies show that immigrants to the United States married to
   natives earn higher wages than immigrants married to other immigrants.
   Using data from the 1980 to 2000 U.S. censuses and the 2005 to 2010
   American Community Surveys, we show that these wage premiums have
   increased over time. Our evidence suggests that the trends are unlikely
   to be explained by changes in the attributes of immigrants who tend to
   marry natives but might instead be a result of changes in how these
   attributes are rewarded in the labor market. Because immigrants married
   to natives tend to have more schooling, part of the increasing premium
   can be explained by increases in the value of a college education. We
   find, however, that even when allowing the value of education and
   English-speaking ability to vary, intermarriage wage premiums have
   increased over time. We believe these patterns might be driven by
   changes in technology and globalization, which have made communication
   and management skills more highly rewarded in the U.S. labor market.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity
   of palonosetron (PAL) and dexamethasone (DEX) on day 1 only in patients
   with gynecologic cancer receiving paclitaxel combined with carboplatin
   (TC). The primary endpoint was to evaluate the complete response (CR)
   rate in the delayed phase.
   This study was a randomized phase 2. Regardless of assignment to either
   study arm, all patients received an intravenous prophylactic regimen of
   DEX (20 mg) within 15 min and then an intravenous dose of PAL (0.75 mg)
   as a bolus given 30 min before initiation of TC on day 1. Patients in
   the DEX 1-day group received no additional DEX on days 2 and 3. Patients
   in the DEX 3-day group received DEX (8 mg) orally on days 2 and 3.
   Eighty-two patients had evaluable data on the primary outcome. The CR
   rates in the delayed phase between the two groups were not statistically
   significantly different (3-day group, 76.9 \% {[}30/39]; 1-day group
   69.8 \% {[}30/43]; p = 0.4652). The frequency of constipation and
   insomnia which were antiemetic treatment-related adverse events was
   similar between two groups, and no serious adverse events occurred.
   Administration of a combination of PAL and DEX 1 day may prevent
   chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in the delayed phase for
   TC as well as administration of DEX 3 days. Further evaluation of the
   antiemetic regimen of combination of PAL and DEX 1 day for TC is
   warranted in future phase 3 trials.}},

Abstract = {{In this contribution we examine the diversity, abundance and species
   richness of Calliphoridae in the Tijuca National Park, Rio de Janeiro,
   RJ. Specimens were collected monthly between September 2009 and August
   2010, using sardines as bait, in three points: A, on the forest edge (22
   degrees 56'846{''}S 43 degrees 17'496{''}W), B, 700m from it (22 degrees
   57'073{''}S 43 degrees 17'832{''}W) and C, 1,200m into the forest (22
   degrees 57'321{''}S 43 degrees 18'031{''}W), evaluating the indicator
   species at each point and the anthropogenic influences and abiotic
   factors that determine species distribution. A total of 16,364
   Calliphoridae were collected and 17 species were identified. Species
   abundance was strongly positively correlated with temperature. The
   greatest number of flies was collected at A, but in this point,
   diversity was lower and most individuals collected belonged to the
   dominant species. Point C, conversely, had the lower abundance and the
   highest diversity. Chrysomya megacephala, an urban and synanthropic
   species, was dominant at point A, whereas Laneela nigripes and
   Mesembrinella peregrina, typically forest species, were considered
   indicators at points B and C, respectively, showing that the
   anthropogenic influence is more intense at the forest edge.}},

Abstract = {{Respiratory insufficiency commonly develops in patients with Late Onset
   Pompe Disease (LOPD). It is conceivable that a timely starting of enzyme
   replacement therapy could avoid this life-threatening complication.
   Respiratory function in LOPD is commonly evaluated with standard
   pulmonary tests which do not extensively provide an accurate definition
   of the muscular pathophysiology. In eleven patients with LOPD and five
   healthy subjects, we compared pulmonary function results with MRI data,
   based on scans of the right lung acquired on maximum expiration and
   inspiration. We observed that variations in the cranio-caudal lung
   height and of lung areas in inspiration and expiration (lung delta) as
   well as the area of diaphragmatic movement strongly correlated with
   pulmonary function results. Moreover, Mill data confirmed that
   development of respiratory insufficiency in LOPD is mainly due to the
   diaphragmatic weakness with sparing of the antero-posterior chest
   expansion related to the activity of the intercostal muscles. These
   results suggest that respiratory muscle MRI is a quick, useful and
   reproducible tool for patient management as well as a reliable outcome
   measure for future LOPD therapeutic trials. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Objective: The objective of this study was to compare treatment
   persistence and rates of seizure-related events in patients who initiate
   antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy with a generic versus a brand-name
   product.
   Methods: We used linked electronic medical and pharmacy claims data to
   identify Medicare beneficiaries who initiated one of five AEDs
   (clonazepam, gabapentin, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, zonisamide). We
   matched initiators of generic versus brand-name versions of these drugs
   using a propensity score that accounted for demographic, clinical, and
   health service utilization variables. We used a Cox proportional hazards
   model to compare rates of seizure-related emergency room (ER) visit or
   hospitalization (primary outcome) and ER visit for bone fracture or head
   injury (secondary outcome) between the matched generic and brand-name
   initiators. We also compared treatment persistence, measured as time to
   first 14-day treatment gap, between generic and brand-name initiators.
   Results: We identified 19,760 AED initiators who met study eligibility
   criteria; 18,306 (93\%) initiated a generic AED. In the matched cohort,
   we observed 47 seizure-related hospitalizations and ER visits among
   brand-name initiators and 31 events among generic initiators,
   corresponding to a hazard ratio of 0.53 (95\% confidence interval, 0.30
   to 0.96). Similar results were observed for the secondary clinical
   endpoint and across sensitivity analyses. Mean time to first treatment
   gap was 124.2 days (standard deviation {[}sd], 125.8) for brand-name
   initiators and 137.9 (sd, 148.6) for generic initiators.
   Significance: Patients who initiated generic AEDs had fewer adverse
   seizure-related clinical outcomes and longer continuous treatment
   periods before experiencing a gap than those who initiated brand-name
   versions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Obesity is associated with systemic inflammation and elevated levels of
   TNF alpha, leading to impaired glucose tolerance. In humans, obesity is
   also associated with reduced nutrient-stimulated secretion of the
   intestinal incretin hormone, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). We
   hypothesized that TNF alpha plays a direct role in the impairment of
   GLP-1 secretion from the enteroendocrine L-cell and that blocking TNF
   alpha can restore both GLP-1 secretion and glucose homeostasis.
   Expression of the TNF alpha receptor subytpe-1 was detected in the human
   NCI-H716 and murine GLUTag L-cell models and in mouse ileal sections.
   Although TNF alpha acutely increased GLP-1 release from NCI-H716 cells
   (P < .05-.001), preincubation with TNF alpha for 24 hours reduced
   proglucagon mRNA (P < .05) and GLP-1 cellular (P < .05) levels without
   affecting cell viability. Furthermore, both NCI-H716 and GLUTag cells
   pretreated with TNF alpha for 24 hours no longer responded to known
   GLP-1 secretagogues, an effect that was reversed by coincubation with
   the Nuclear Factor Kappa B inhibitor, 5-aminosalicylic acid, in the
   NCI-H716 cells. Mice given a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks developed
   impaired glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinemia, and increased TNF alpha
   mRNA expression in fat and ileal tissue. Hyperglycemia and
   hyperinsulinemia were reduced in HFD mice treated with the anti-TNF
   alpha biological, etanercept, for 2 weeks. In primary intestinal
   cultures from these animals, HFD control mice had impaired GLP-1
   secretion, and this was not observed in the HFD etanercept-derived
   cultures (P < .05). In conclusion, chronic exposure to TNF alpha
   directly impairs GLP-1 secretion at the level of the intestinal L-cell,
   an effect that is reversed by anti-TNF alpha therapy in association with
   improved glucose tolerance.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Primary repair of Fallot tetralogy has been performed
   successfully for the last 45 years. It has low surgical mortality (<
   5\%), with excellent long-term results. However, there are delayed
   adverse effects: progressive right ventricular dilation and dysfunction,
   arrhythmia, and sudden death. In our centre, Fa Hot tetralogy is the
   most common form of cyanotic congenital heart disease (including
   transannular patch) and accounts for 7.5\% of all cardiovascular
   surgical procedures. The mid-term follow-up results are reported.
   Material and methods: Case series. The study included patients who had
   complete repair of Fallot tetralogy with transannular patch from January
   2000 to December 2009. An analysis was performed on the clinical
   variables, morbidity and mortality.
   Results: There were 52 patients in the study, with mean age 4 2 years.
   Perioperative mortality in 6 patients, with 5 associated with residual
   right ventricular obstruction and, 1 associated with further surgery.
   The survival rate was 88\% (46) patients, with a follow-up 75 26 months.
   Late morbidity occurred in 14, due to right ventricular dysfunction in
   11, recurrent distal obstruction in 2, and residual ventricular septal
   defect in 1. Associated risk factors were severe pulmonary insufficiency
   (p = 0.001); QRS > 160 ms, p = 0.001); cardiothoracic > 0.60 index, (p =
   0.048), and tricuspid regurgitation (p = 0.001).
   Conclusions: There was reasonable long-term survival and excellent
   quality of life after total correction of Fallot tetralogy; however,
   progressive right ventricular dysfunction requires continuous
   monitoring, as well as the choice of optimal timing of pulmonary valve
   replacement. (C) 2015 Academia Mexicana de Cirugia A.C. Published by

Abstract = {{Identifying preventable exposures that lead to asthma and associated
   allergies has proved challenging, partly because of the difficulty in
   differentiating phenotypes that define homogeneous disease groups.
   Understanding the socioeconomic patterns of disease phenotypes can help
   distinguish which exposures are preventable. In the present study, we
   identified disease phenotypes that are susceptible to socioeconomic
   variation, and we determined which life-course exposures were associated
   with these inequalities in a contemporary birth cohort. Participants
   included children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and
   Children, a population-based birth cohort in England, who were born in
   1991 and 1992 and attended the clinic at 7-8 years of age (n = 6,378).
   Disease phenotypes included asthma, atopy, wheezing, altered lung
   function, and bronchial reactivity phenotypes. Combining atopy with a
   diagnosis of asthma from a doctor captured the greatest socioeconomic
   variation, including opposing patterns between phenotype groups:
   Children with a low socioeconomic position (SEP) had more asthma alone
   (adjusted multinomial odds ratio = 1.50, 95\% confidence interval: 1.21,
   1.87) but less atopy alone (adjusted multinomial odds ratio = 0.80, 95\%
   confidence interval: 0.66, 0.98) than did children with high SEP.
   Adjustment for maternal exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy and
   childhood exposure to tobacco smoke reduced the odds of asthma alone in
   children with a low SEP. Current inequalities among children who have
   asthma but not atopy can be prevented by eliminating exposure to tobacco
   smoke. Other disease phenotypes were not socially patterned or had SEP
   patterns that were not related to smoke exposure.}},

Abstract = {{Even though polycrystalline graphene has shown a surprisingly high
   tensile strength, the influence of inherent grain boundaries on such
   property remains unclear. We study the fracture properties of a series
   of polycrystalline graphene models of increasing thermodynamic
   stability, as obtained from a long molecular dynamics simulation at an
   elevated temperature. All of the models show the typical and
   well-documented brittle fracture behavior of polycrystalline graphene;
   however, a clear decrease in all fracture properties is observed with
   increasing annealing time. The remarkably high fracture properties
   obtained for the most disordered (less annealed) structures arise from
   the formation of many nonpropagating prefracture cracks, significantly
   retarding failure. The stability of these reversible cracks is due to
   the nonlocal character of load transfer after a bond rupture in very
   disordered systems. It results in an insufficient strain level on
   neighboring bonds to promote fracture propagation. Although
   polycrystallinity seems to be an unavoidable feature of chemically
   synthesized graphenes, these results suggest that targeting highly
   disordered states might be a convenient way to obtain improved
   mechanical properties.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Chronic methamphetamine (METH) abuse could induce
   neurotoxicity due to reactive oxygen species generation and sympathetic
   activation. Both factors are associated with atherosclerosis, so we
   tested the hypothesis that chronic METH administration might also
   promote atherosclerosis formation in Apo E-/- knockout mice fed normal
   diet.
   Methods and Results: Male ApoE-/- mice (6 weeks-old) were treated with
   saline (NS) or METH {[}4 mg/kg/day (M4) or 8 mg/kg/day (M8) through
   intraperitoneal injection] for 24 weeks. Atherosclerotic lesion area on
   oil red O stained en face aorta was dose-dependently increased in M4 and
   M8 groups compared to NS group. Percentage of atherosclerotic lesion
   area was significantly higher in M8 group compared to NS and M4 groups.
   Plasma CRP was increased and inflammatory cytokine (ICAM-1, VCAM-1,
   TNF-alpha, and INF-gamma) expression on aortic root was upregulated in
   METH groups compared to NS group. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) protein and mRNA
   expressions in aortic root and myocardial tissue were determined by
   Western blot and real time PCR, which were significantly upregulated in
   M4 and M8 groups. Moreover, mRNA expressions of NPY1R, NPY2R and NPY5R
   in aortic and myocardial tissue were also significantly upregulated in
   M4 and M8 groups. Raw264.7 cells were treated with NPY, NPY receptor
   antagonists, METH (10 mu M or 100 mu M) with or without
   lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the expressions of TNF-alpha, CRP, MCP-1
   and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were significantly
   increased in METH and LPS + METH groups compared to control and LPS
   groups. Co-treatment with NPY1R antagonist decreased the expressions of
   TNF-alpha, CRP and MCP-1 in NPY and METH treated cells.
   Conclusions: Chronic METH administration can promote inflammation and
   atherosclerotic plague formation in ApoE-/- mice fed normal chow. NPY
   might be involved in the pathogenesis of METH-induced atherogenic
   effects through NPY Y1 receptor pathway. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of insulin
   growth factor-I (IGF-I) on the size of pig skeletal muscle satellite
   cells (SCs). Using microarray, real-time RT-PCR, radioimmunoassay
   analysis and western blot, we first showed that supplementation of
   low-dose of IGF-I in culture medium resulted in enlarged cell size of
   Lantang SCs, only Akt and S6K were up-regulated at both the mRNA and
   protein levels among almost all of the mTOR pathway key genes, but had
   no effect on cell number. To elucidate the signaling mechanisms
   responsible for regulating cell size under low-dose of IGF-I treatment,
   we blocked Akt and S6K activity with the specific inhibitors MK2206 and
   PF4708671, respectively. Both inhibitors caused a decrease in cell size.
   In addition, MK2206 lowered the protein level of p-Akt (Ser473), p-S6K
   (Thr389), and p-rpS6 (Ser235/236), whereas PF4708671 lowered the protein
   level of p-S6K (Thr389) and p-rpS6 (Ser235/236). However, low dose of
   IGF-I didn't affect the protein level of p-mTOR (Ser2448) and p-mTOR
   (Ser2481). When both inhibitors were applied simultaneously, the effect
   was the same as that of the Akt inhibition alone. Taken together, we
   report for the first time that low-dose of IGF-I treatment increases

Abstract = {{Objective
   To discover the relationship between computed tomography (CT) parameters
   of retroperitoneal soft tissue of untreated retroperitoneal fibrosis
   patients and the variation of renal function after treatment.
   Methods
   Data were collected retrospectively from 42 patients with established
   diagnosis of retroperitoneal fibrosis, at the Department of Rheumatology
   in Peking University First Hospital from May 2009 to April 2015. The
   demographic information, clinical characteristics, laboratory data,
   treatment and general therapeutic response were collected. The CT
   parameters such as radial lines, Hounsfield unit values, radiographic
   classification at baseline before the initiation of therapy were
   measured. Then the correlations between baseline CT parameters and
   clinical data were analysed.
   Results
   The Hounsfield unit values of venous phase and delayed phase at baseline
   were negatively correlated with the change of estimated glomerular
   filtration rate (Delta eGFR) at the 12th month after the initiation of
   medications. The baseline transverse diameters of the retroperitoneal
   soft tissue were larger in the group of eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)
   compared with the group of eGFR >= 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) at the 12th
   month, while the vertical diameters and maximum cross-section thickness
   were not. The baseline transverse diameters were also significantly
   correlated with the duration of intubation.
   Conclusion
   The baseline Hounsfield unit values and baseline transverse diameters of
   soft tissue of untreated retroperitoneal fibrosis patients may be used
   to predict the renal function after 12 months of therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Desalination by freezing is of great prospect due to its low energy
   consumption, little pollution, freedom of corrosion and ease of scaling.
   A novel freezing desalination method driven by humidity difference
   between air flow and liquid surface is proposed and verified in this
   paper. In order to reveal its mechanism, an unsteady-state
   thermodynamics model was established to simulate icing movement on
   liquid surface according to heat and mass balance. Effects of humidity
   difference, airflow velocity and mass diffusion coefficient on icing
   development were analyzed through theory analysis and experiments. It
   was found that the larger humidity difference and larger airflow
   velocity had evident effects on the liquid evaporation-freezing.
   Meanwhile, fast mass diffusion between mediums was also beneficial to
   this freezing process.}},

Abstract = {{Kindler syndrome (KS; OMIM 173650) is a rare autosomal recessive skin
   disorder, which results in symptoms including blistering, epidermal
   atrophy, increased risk of cancer, and poor wound healing. The majority
   of mutations of the disease-determining gene (FERMT1 gene) are single
   nucleotide substitutions, including missense mutations, nonsense
   mutations, etc. Large deletion mutations are seldom reported. To
   determine the mutation in the FERMT1 gene associated with a 7-year-old
   Chinese patient who presented clinical manifestation of KS, we performed
   direct sequencing of all the exons of FERMT1 gene. For the exons 2-6
   without amplicons, we analyzed the copy numbers using quantitative
   real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) with specific primers. The
   deletion breakpoints were sublocalized and the range of deletion was
   confirmed by PCR and direct sequencing. In this study, we identified a
   new 17-kb deletion mutation spanning the introns 1-6 of FERMT1 gene in a
   Chinese patient with severe KS phenotypes. Her parents were carriers of
   the same mutation. Our study reported a newly identified large deletion
   mutation of FERMT1 gene involved in KS, which further enriched the
   mutation spectrum of the FERMT1 gene.}},

Title = {{Economic Impact of Smoke-Free Legislation: Did the Spanish Tobacco
   Control Law Affect the Economic Activity of Bars and Restaurants?}},

Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{11}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: The potential of smoke-free bans to negatively impact the
   hospitality business has been an argument of the hospitality and tobacco
   industry against such legislation. A partial smoke-free legislation was
   introduced in Spain in 2006 allowing smoking in most bars and
   restaurants due to the pressure of the hospitality sector. However, this
   partial ban was later amended in 2011 to include all the hospitality
   premises without exceptions. The stepped Spanish process permits to
   evaluate whether the entry into force of the smoke-free legislation had
   any effect on the economic activity of the hospitality sector.
   Methods: We employed a pooled time series cross-sectional design, with
   national data over 6 years (2006-2011). The dependent variable used was
   the total number of bars and restaurants per 100,000 inhabitants. The
   explanatory variables used were the average amount of spending per
   household in bars and restaurants, and the total unemployment rate in
   Spain by regions.
   Results: For every 1\% increase in the unemployment rate there was a
   0.05\% decrease in the number of bars and restaurants. In 2007, the
   number of bars and restaurants was significantly reduced by 13.06\% (all
   others factors being held constant), 4.87\% in 2008, and 10.42\% in
   2009. No statistically significant effect of the smoke-free legislation
   emerged from 2010 (6.76\%) to 2011 (7.69\%).
   Conclusion: The new Spanish smoke-free legislation had no effect on the
   number of bars and restaurants.}},

Title = {{Pelagic early life stages promote connectivity in the demersal labrid
   Choerodon rubescens}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{472}},
Pages = {{142-150}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Population connectivity has profound ecological and evolutionary
   implications. In marine species with complex life cycles, the nature of
   these implications depends on both the amount of dispersal and the
   life-cycle stage(s) through which dispersal occurs. For demersal fishes
   with such life cycles, the pelagic early life stages (ELS) are generally
   considered the main dispersive phase, though this assumption has rarely
   been tested. This research investigates genetic connectivity in the
   reef-dwelling labrid Choerodon rubescens, which is a prized eating fish
   endemic to ca 1200 km of the west coast of Australia. This species has
   demersal juveniles and adults, and pelagic ELS that are predicted to
   last about 25-30 days. The aim of the study was to use patterns of
   variation at 12 microsatellite loci to test the hypothesis that C.
   rubescens is genetically homogeneous across its main distribution. The
   genetic analyses were based on samples of 26-40 individuals from six
   locations, which collectively span all of the areas where C rubescens is
   common. The values of global F-ST (0.0019) and D-EST (0.0010) were not
   significantly different from zero and Bayesian clustering indicated that
   all individuals belonged to a single genetic group. In addition, Mantel
   tests showed no evidence of isolation by distance. These results support
   the view that C. rubescens is genetically homogeneous over all or most
   of its geographic range. Since published otolith microchemistry evidence
   indicates that the juveniles and adults of C rubescens are relatively
   sedentary, these results also imply that the pelagic ELS are the main
   avenue of dispersal in this species. This study highlights the value of
   combining the results of complementary methods for assessing the
   relative importance of the different life-cycle stages in dispersing a
   fish species. The results also have implications for the management of C
   rubescens, which has shown signs of localised overfishing. Specifically,
   the dispersal of the ELS provides a mechanism for the recruitment of C
   rubescens to non-natal reefs. Such connectivity could help this species
   to recover from localised depletions in abundance and ameliorate the
   potential evolutionary consequences of any localised overfishing, such
   as reductions in genetic diversity or selective responses to harvesting.

Abstract = {{Purpose To evaluate the stages of completion and approaches to scoring
   the PGI for reliability, validity and responsiveness.
   Methods Participants of inpatient rehabilitation or self-management
   programmes completed the closed PGI with the same areas at 1 year as
   baseline. Test-retest reliability, validity and responsiveness were
   assessed for area scores (stage one), points (stage two) and methods of
   scoring the PGI.
   Results One hundred and forty-five patients participated, and 118 (81
   \%) completed the PGI correctly. Test-retest intraclass correlations
   were over 0.90 for area scores (stage two) and were 0.87 and 0.86 for
   final PGI scores with and without the sixth ``rest of life{''} box.
   Individual area scores had the highest correlations with those for
   instruments assessing similar constructs; those for the area ``rest of
   life{''} were lower. Compared to scores based on the sum of the stage
   two areas, PGI scores had higher correlations of a moderate level with
   those for patient-reported instruments widely used within rheumatology.
   Correlations were of a similar level with and without the sixth ``rest
   of life{''} area, and those based on baseline points at follow-up were
   highest. The PGI had higher SRMs than the other instruments at 1 year,
   the highest being for PGI scores based on baseline points.
   Conclusions The fully closed version of the PGI, which uses baseline
   areas and baseline stage three points at follow-up, is most appropriate
   for assessing outcomes within healthcare evaluation. The sixth ``rest of
   life{''} area has poorer measurement properties, and its removal does
   not adversely affect the measurement properties of the PGI.}},

Abstract = {{The focus of my article is a unique place, the Yiddish Book Center in
   Amherst, Massachusetts, which connects Yiddish culture with the American
   one, the experience of the Holocaust with the descendants of the
   survivors, and a modern idea of Jewishness with the context of American
   postmodernity. Created in the 1980s, in the mind of a young and
   enthusiastic student Aaron Lansky, the Yiddish Book Center throughout
   the years has become a unique place on the American cultural map.
   Traversing the continents and crossing borders, Lansky and his
   co-workers for over thirty years have been saving Yiddish language books
   from extinction. The Center, however, has long stopped to be merely a
   storage house for the collection, but instead has grown into a vibrant
   hub of Yiddishkeit in the United States. Its employees do not only
   collect, distribute, digitalize and post online the forgotten volumes,
   but also engage in diverse activities, scholarly and cultural, that
   promote the survival of the tradition connected with Yiddish culture.
   They educate, offering internships and fellowships to students
   interested in learning Yiddish from across the world, translate,
   publish, and exhibit Yiddish language materials, in this way finding new
   users for the language whose speakers were virtually annihilated by the
   Holocaust. To honour their legacy, a separate project is aimed at
   conducting video interviews that record life testimonies of the speakers
   of Yiddish. Aaron Lansky's 2004 memoir, Outwitting History, provides an
   interesting insight into the complexities of his arduous life mission.
   Today, the Center lives its own unique life, serving the world of
   academia and Yiddishkeit enthusiasts alike.}},

Title = {{The role of prominence in Spanish sentence comprehension: An ERP study}},
Journal = {{BRAIN AND LANGUAGE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{150}},
Pages = {{22-35}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Prominence is the hierarchical relation among arguments that allows us
   to understand `Who did what to whom' in a sentence. The present study
   aimed to provide evidence about the role of prominence information for
   the incremental interpretation of arguments in Spanish. We investigated
   the time course of neural correlates associated to the comprehension of
   sentences that require a reversal of argument prominence
   hierarchization. We also studied how the amount of available prominence
   information may affect the incremental build-up of verbal expectations.
   Results of the ERP data revealed that at the disambiguating verb region,
   object-initial sentences (only one argument available) elicited a
   centro-parietal negativity with a peak at 400 ms post-onset.
   Subject-initial sentences (two arguments available) yielded a broadly
   distributed positivity at around 650 ms. This dissociation suggests that
   argument interpretation may depend on their morphosyntactic features,
   and also on the amount of prominence information available before the
   verb is encountered. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: This study determined whether the NYU Caregiver Intervention
   for Adult Children (the NYUCI-AC) significantly reduced depressive
   symptoms and improved quality of life for adult child caregivers of
   persons with dementia. Methods: The NYUCI-AC was evaluated within a
   single-blinded randomized controlled trial. The sample included 107
   adult child caregivers of persons with dementia (N = 54 assigned to the
   multi-component treatment group; N = 53 assigned to a contact control
   group). Participants completed comprehensive assessments every 4 months
   during the first year and every 6 months thereafter for at least 2 years
   and up to 3.79 years. Results: Individual growth curve models found that
   caregivers in the NYUCI-AC treatment condition indicated statistically
   significant (p < 0.05) curvilinear decreases in symptoms of depression
   indicating withdrawal, apathy, and lack of vigor and increases in
   perceptions of overall quality of life over a 3-year period in
   comparison to control caregivers. Conclusions: The NYUCI-AC offered
   adult child caregivers the capacity, via individual and family
   counseling as well as ongoing support, to enhance their quality of life
   and overcome their social withdrawal and apathy over time. These
   findings lend additional support to the NYUCI as an evidence-based
   approach to support family caregivers of persons with dementia.}},

Abstract = {{Let GA be a hereditary family of graphs and Ha hereditary family of

   graph if it can be obtained from a graph GA(V, D) is an element of GA by
   deleting the edges of an edge subgraph H(V, E') is an element of H. The
   GA-H reduced graphs are a generalization of the complements of the
   H-mixed graphs. Examples of such families of GA-H reduced graphs are the
   interval filament graphs, the subtree filament graphs, the circular-arc
   filament graphs, the cactus subtree filament graphs, the
   3D-interval-filament graphs and the subgraph overlap graphs.
   We describe polynomial time algorithms for various problems on GA-H
   reduced graphs, when the families GA and H have specific properties. The
   algorithms are to find maximum independent sets, maximum K-packings,
   maximum cliques, maximum induced complete bipartite subgraphs, maximum
   weight holes of a given parity and antiholes of a given parity. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Predicted increases in the frequency and duration of drought are
   expected to negatively affect tree vitality, but we know little about
   how water shortage will influence needle anatomy and thereby the trees'
   photosynthetic and hydraulic capacity. In this study, we evaluated
   anatomical changes in sun and shade needles of 20-year-old Norway spruce
   trees exposed to artificial drought stress. Canopy position was found to
   be important for needle structure, as sun needles had significantly
   higher values than shade needles for all anatomical traits (i.e.,
   cross-sectional needle area, number of tracheids in needle, needle
   hydraulic conductivity, and tracheid lumen area), except proportion of
   xylem area per cross-sectional needle area. In sun needles, drought
   reduced all trait values by 10-40\%, whereas in shade needles, only
   tracheid maximum diameter was reduced by drought. Due to the relatively
   weaker response of shade needles than sun needles in drought-stressed
   trees, the difference between the two needle types was reduced by 25\%
   in the drought-stressed trees compared to the control trees. The
   observed changes in needle anatomy provide new understanding of how
   Norway spruce adapts to drought stress and may improve predictions of
   how forests will respond to global climate change.}},

Abstract = {{During a loss of vacuum accident (LOVA), dusts that will be present in
   the future tokamak ITER are likely to be re-suspended. Such aerosols
   formed may present a risk for explosion and airborne contamination. This
   article presents parameters that govern the forces affecting particles
   deposited on a wall and subject to airflow. It is shown the influence of
   three parameters in the dust mobilization mechanism, i.e.: the particles
   diameter, the fluid density and the friction velocity. From numerical
   simulations, it is determined the evolution of wall friction velocities
   in the vacuum vessel (VV) of ITER during a LOVA. The numerical
   calculations performed with ANSYS CFX code provide average friction
   velocities in the lower part of the tokamak between 12 ms(-1) at a

Pages = {{18-28}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{This article proposes a variational approach to describe the evolution
   of organization of complex systems from first principles, as increased
   efficiency of physical action. Most simply stated, physical action is
   the product of the energy and time necessary for motion. When complex
   systems are modeled as flow networks, this efficiency is defined as a
   decrease of action for one element to cross between two nodes, or
   endpoints of motiona principle of least unit action. We find a
   connection with another principle, that of most total action, or a
   tendency for increase of the total action of a system. This increase
   provides more energy and time for minimization of the constraints to
   motion to decrease unit action, and therefore, to increase organization.
   Also, with the decrease of unit action in a system, its capacity for
   total amount of action increases. We present a model of positive
   feedback between action efficiency and the total amount of action in a
   complex system, based on a system of ordinary differential equations,
   which leads to an exponential growth with time of each and a power law
   relation between the two. We present an agreement of our model with data
   for core processing units of computers. This approach can help to
   describe, measure, manage, design, and predict future behavior of
   complex systems to achieve the highest rates of self-organization and
   robustness. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Model calculations for commensurability oscillations of the low-field
   magnetoresistance of two-dimensional electron systems (2DES) in lateral
   superlattices, consisting of unit cells with an internal structure, are
   compared with recent experiments. The relevant harmonics of the
   effective modulation potential depend not only on the geometrical
   structure of the modulated unit cell, but also strongly on the nature of
   the modulation. While higher harmonics of an electrostatically generated
   surface modulation are exponentially damped at the position of the 2DES
   about 90 nm below the surface, no such damping appears for strain
   induced modulation generated, e.g., by the deposition of stripes of
   calixarene resist on the surface before cooling clown the sample. (C)

Abstract = {{Background: The patent protection of low-molecular-weight heparins
   (LMWHs) expired, so the definition of criteria for the biological
   similarity between LMWH copies and the original product is a real need.
   Aim: The present in vitro study compared copies and branded enoxaparin
   using the specific anti-Xa activity and the calibrated automated
   thrombogram assay.
   Methods: Samples of platelet-poor plasma (PPP) and platelet-rich plasma
   (PRP) from 15 healthy volunteers were spiked with branded enoxaparin
   (Lovenox) or its copies (Cutenox, Dilutol, Enoxa, Fibrinox, Loparin,
   Lupenox, Novex, Noxprin, and Versa). The specific anti-Xa activity was
   measured in PPP, and thrombin generation was assessed in PPP and PRP in
   the presence of tissue factor or pancreatic cancer cells BXPC3.
   Results: The anti-Xa activity of enoxaparin copies ranged from 0.072 to
   0.088 IU/g, being lower as compared to the branded enoxaparin (0.095
   anti-Xa IU/g). The potency of each copy to inhibit thrombin generation
   varied in the 3 experimental systems. The presence of platelets or
   pancreatic cancer cells BXPC3 in human plasma induced significant
   modifications in the inhibitory efficiency of enoxaparin copies on
   thrombin generation, which distinguished them from the branded product.
   Conclusion: Enoxaparin copies showed significant variability regarding
   their inhibitory potency on thrombin generation. Platelets and cancer
   cells significantly increased the variability of the antithrombotic
   efficiency of the copies as compared to the branded enoxaparin. The
   present study underlines the need for the elaboration of additional
   functional criteria to evaluate the global antithrombotic capacity of
   enoxaparin copies in order to evaluate their potential sameness with the
   branded drug.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveTo assess the performance of RDTs against nested polymerase
   chain reaction (nPCR) for the diagnosis of malaria in public health
   facilities in north-western Ethiopia.
   MethodsCross-sectional study at public health facilities in North
   Gondar, Ethiopia, of 359 febrile patients with signs and symptoms
   consistent with malaria. Finger prick blood samples were collected for
   testing in a P.falciparum/pan-malaria RDTs and for molecular analysis.
   Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were determined for the
   RDTs using nPCR as reference diagnostic method. Kappa value was
   determined to demonstrate the consistency of the results between the
   diagnostic tools.
   ResultsBy RDTs, 22.28\% (80/359) of patients tested positive for
   malaria, and by nPCR, 27.02\% (97/359) did. In nPCR, 1.67\% (6/359) and
   0.28\% (1/359) samples were positive for P.ovale and P.malariae, which
   had almost all tested negative in the RDTs. The sensitivity,
   specificity, positive and negative predictive values of RDTs for the
   diagnosis of malaria were 62.9\%, 92.7\%, 76.3\% and 87.1\%,
   respectively, with 0.589 measurement agreement between RDTs and nPCR.
   The sensitivity and specificity of RDTs for P.falciparum identification
   only were 70.8\% and 95.2\%, and 65.2\% and 93.1\% for P.vivax.
   ConclusionAlthough RDTs are commonly used at health posts in
   resource-limited environments, their sensitivity and specificity for the
   detection and species identification of Plasmodium parasites were poor
   compared to nPCR, suggesting caution in interpreting RDTs results.
   Particularly, in the light of expanded efforts to eliminate malaria in
   the country, more sensitive diagnostic procedures will be needed.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we have investigated how to control the net flux of water
   molecules transported through a CNT using an orthogonal and axial
   electric field. The flow of water molecules through CNT decrease as the
   orthogonal electric field strength (E) increased from 1 to 3 V nm(-1).
   When E increases over 3 V nm(-1), the flow of water molecules through
   the CNT was turned off and zero water flow was observed. Both the number
   of water molecules in tube and free energy values was influenced by
   water flow. A reverse behavior was observed in the case of axial
   electric field by constantly maintaining electric field direction in the
   direction of the water flow. Increase of water flow with E of axial
   electric field was revealed and it can be concluded that water
   permeation through CNT is much sensitive to the axial electric field
   strength than the orthogonal electric field.}},

Abstract = {{One of the vital components of a successful private legal practice is
   good account management. Legal firms have a unique business process and
   specific rules on how accounting records should be kept and recorded. At
   present, there are many software packages for legal account management
   systems such as the MyCase web-based legal practice management software
   and the QuickBooks legal accounting software. However, for small-and
   medium-size legal firms in Malaysia, the software designed for
   international use might not be suitable. The majority of local law firms
   are SMEs and most of the time, their account management is done by the
   lawyers themselves. With limited knowledge of accounting and business
   management, it is not a surprise that many legal practitioners face
   difficulties in managing their accounts. LAFAMS (Law Firm Account
   Management System) was developed to assist legal firms to manage their
   financial transactions, monitor their performance, record cash inflow
   and outflow and facilitate the auditing process. The system requires
   only the basic Windows operating system and is easy to operate. The
   report produced by LAFAMS should be sufficient for submission to the Bar
   Council as evidence of proper account-keeping by legal firms.}},

Abstract = {{Combustion dynamics of a V-flame in an afterburner-type configuration
   are investigated using high-order compressible large eddy simulations
   (LES) and compared to experimental results. Both self-excited
   longitudinal (100 Hz) and transverse (1400 Hz) modes observed in the
   experiments are captured by LES and instability mechanisms are
   discussed. LES results for all modes are compared to a Helmholtz solver
   output, showing that the transverse mode appearing in the LES is the
   1Lx-2Ty-OTz eigenmode of the chamber, affecting the velocity field
   symmetrically. The 1Lx fluctuation causes a symmetric flame roll-up
   which increases heat release rate fluctuations, closing the feedback
   loop. The 2Ty component of the mode is active along the flame holder
   axis and causes not only transverse fluctuations but also a
   reorganization of the mean flame along two main zones located on both
   sides of the zero acoustic velocity plane, a feature that has not been
   reported before. Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is used to extract the
   structure of the transverse mode from LES snapshots which is found to
   match the Helmholtz solver prediction. This study confirms the capacity
   of high-order LES to capture not only low-frequency oscillations but
   also high-order frequency transverse modes in combustion chambers. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper examines how Muslim Iranian women who work in broadcast media
   position themselves in relation to motherhood and work. It argues that
   these women assert their agency by refusing to conform to two
   stereotypical images that are ascribed to women by different ideological
   discourses in Iranian society: `the traditional woman' who is merely
   devoted to family roles and the domestic space; and `the liberated
   woman' who is active in the society and disregards family roles. Based
   on data from 30 semi-structured interviews, the paper argues that most
   of these highly educated and active women, maintain that the mother's
   role is still a very important aspect of their life. Overall the paper
   contends that after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iranian middle-class
   Muslim women have constructed a new identity that values higher
   education and endorses professional involvement in the society, while
   remaining loyal to the family and idealizing motherhood. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Mesoporous silica nanoparticles with a hexagonal structure (SBA-15) were
   synthesized and modified with (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES),
   and their performance as a carrier for drug delivery system was studied.
   Chemical structure and morphology of the synthesized and modified SBA-15
   were characterized by SEM, BET, TEM, FT-IR and CHN technique.
   Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate (BSP) as a water soluble drug was loaded
   on the mesoporous silica particle for the first time. The response
   surface method was employed to obtain the optimum conditions for the
   drug/silica nanoparticle preparation, by using Design-Expert software.
   The effect of time, pH of preparative media, and drug/silica ratio on
   the drug loading efficiency was investigated by the software. The
   maximum loading (33.69\%) was achieved under optimized condition (pH:
   1.8, time: 3.54 (h) and drug/silica ratio: 1.7). The in vitro release
   behavior of drug loaded particles under various pH values was evaluated.
   Finally, the release kinetic of the drug was investigated using the
   Higuchi and Korsmeyer-Peppas models. Cell culture and cytotoxicity
   assays revealed the synthesized product doesn't have any cytotoxicity
   against human bladder cell line 5637. Accordingly, the produced
   drug-loaded nanostructures can be applied via different routes, such as
   implantation and topical or oral administration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{A multiscale Lagrangian particle solver introduced in our previous work
   is extended to model physiologically realistic near-wall cell dynamics.
   Three-dimensional simulation of particle trajectories is combined with
   realistic receptor-ligand adhesion behaviour to cover full cell
   interactions in the vicinity of the endothelium. The selected stochastic
   adhesion model, which is based on a Monte Carlo acceptance-rejection
   method, fits in our Lagrangian framework and does not compromise
   performance. Additionally, appropriate inflow/outflow boundary
   conditions are implemented for our SPH solver to enable realistic
   pulsatile flow simulation. The model is tested against in-vitro data
   from a 3D geometry with a stenosis and sudden expansion. In both steady
   and pulsatile flow conditions, results show close agreement with the
   experimental ones. Furthermore we demonstrate, in agreement with
   experimental observations, that haemodynamics alone does not account for
   adhesion of white blood cells, in this case U937 monocytic human cells.
   Our findings suggest that the current framework is fully capable of
   modelling cell dynamics in large arteries in a realistic and efficient

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new methodology to monitor the fermentation
   process and detect the optimum fermentation time of crush tear curl
   black tea with a voltammetric electronic tongue. An electronic tongue
   with an array of five noble metal working electrodes has been developed
   for this purpose. A suitable large amplitude pulse voltammetric waveform
   has been employed for probing the chemical changes in tea samples under
   fermentation. Good correlation between the electronic tongue responses
   and the biochemical changes has been obtained by principal component
   analysis (PCA) during various stages of fermentation. The electronic
   tongue fermentation profile has been derived from PCA analysis and it is
   observed that such a profile enables detection of optimum fermentation
   times. Finally, a model based on partial least squares regression
   technique has been developed for real-time indication of fermentation
   level. The optimum fermentation times observed from the electronic
   tongue fermentation profiles derived from PCA and partial least squares
   regression correlate by a factor of 0.97 and 0.96, respectively, with
   the reference values obtained from an ultraviolet-visible
   spectrophotometer-based instrumental analysis.}},

Abstract = {{In spite of the importance of music to many people and its ubiquitous
   presence, its symbolic function has been explored by psychoanalysis and
   analytical psychology far less than that of language, visual images,
   symptoms and dreams. In the first part of this paper, the relation
   between psychoanalysis and music is considered with reference to
   Freudian, Jungian and Lacanian approaches. An argument is then developed
   for the aptness of instrumental music to represent archaic, pre-symbolic
   unconscious processes, thanks to its inherent properties of being rooted
   in the physiology of the body and affects and its happening in time. The
   development of instrumental music in the first half of the 20th century
   is then traced, following the meltdown of conventional harmonic, melodic
   and rhythmic structures, which led music to turn inward and further
   develop a capacity to represent aspects of the unrepressed unconscious
   such as coalescence of opposites, symmetry, repetition, lack of
   development, erasure of the subject. This expands the possibilities for
   music to convey the experience of the sublime as a breakthrough towards
   the ineffable, as exemplified through a detailed analysis of Messiaen's
   techniques' for the sublime with particular reference to his 1941 work
   Quartet for the End of Time.}},

   do not support such a model of the E'-Ge{*}, nor the latter can be
   simply regarded as an E'-Ge center with a distorted geometry. A fair
   agreement with the experimental EPR parameters supports the assignment
   of the Ge(2) center in a-GeO2 to GeFO configurations. Furthermore we
   show that electronic levels induced in the bandgap by GeFO
   configurations are considerably deeper (similar to 1 eV) with respect to
   those related to the E'-Ge centers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Decision making is the foundation of any sphere of activity. Its
   effectiveness depends on the quality of management decisions. In modern
   management conditions, new opportunities appear in the sphere of
   decision making. They presuppose the carrying out of a wide variety of
   calculations, justification of criteria for evaluating various
   alternatives and their priorities, and determining actions in conditions
   of risk and uncertainty. Moreover, non-standard decisions, the
   consequences of which are difficult to predict and to quantitatively
   measure, are particularly difficult in management practice. Classical
   management techniques view personnel decisions as a process of three
   main stages: preparing a decision, making a decision, implementing a
   decision. In academic literature, there exists a large number of
   detailed schemes for making personnel decisions. They have much in
   common, although the number and content of separate stages may differ
   considerably. In practice, separate steps are united or are altogether
   absent. In the authors' opinion, personnel management decision making
   can be schematically described in the following seven interconnected
   stages: 1. Diagnosis of the personnel problem. 2. Deciding on the
   criteria for evaluating the decision. 3. Determining the priorities
   (significance of criteria). 4. Identifying possible alternatives in
   problem solving. 5. Evaluating alternatives. 6. Final decision. 7.
   Implementation of the decision and evaluation of its results. A
   successful management decision must fulfill the following requirements:
   complete justification, reality, timeliness, economy. The effectiveness
   of a personnel decision is a resource result, gained based on the
   results of preparation and implementation of a personnel decision in the
   organization. It follows that one must distinguish between
   organizational, economic, psychological, legal, ethical, technological
   and social effectiveness of management decisions. Only due to links and
   interconnections of all types of effectiveness one can speak about
   strategically considered personnel management decision.}},

   technology with GPS and compass functionality, this paper demonstrates
   two methods for on-demand dissemination of existing virtual 3D landscape
   models using: (1) a touch based interface with integrated mapping; (2) a
   standard web browser interface on mobile phones. The latter method
   demonstrates the potential to reduce the complexity of accessing an
   existing 3D landscape model on-site to simply pointing a smartphone in a
   particular direction, loading a web page and seeing the relevant view of
   the model as an image. A prototype system was developed to demonstrate
   both methods successfully, but it was also ascertained that the accuracy
   of GPS positional data can have a negative effect on the browser based
   method.
   Finally, potential developments are presented exploring the future of
   the technology underpinning the method and possible extensions to the
   prototype as a technique for increasing public participation in planning
   and design. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the possibility of links between the biological
   immobilization of uranium (U) and ammonium oxidation under iron (Fe)
   reducing conditions. The recently-identified Acidimicrobiaceae bacterium
   A6 (ATCC, PTA-122488) derives energy from ammonium oxidation coupled
   with Fe reduction. This bacterium has been found in various soil and
   wetland environments, including U-contaminated wetland sediments.
   Incubations of Acidimicrobiaceae bacteria A6 with nontronite, an
   Fe(III)-rich clay, and approximately 10 A mu M U indicate that these
   bacteria can use U(VI) in addition to Fe(III) as an electron acceptor in
   the presence of ammonium. Measurements of Fe(II) production and ammonium
   oxidation support this interpretation. Concentrations of approximately
   100 A mu M U were found to entirely inhibit Acidimicrobiaceae bacteria
   A6 activity. These results suggest that natural sites of active ammonium
   oxidation under Fe reducing conditions by Acidimicrobiaceae bacteria A6
   could be hotspots of U immobilization by bioreduction. This is the first
   report of biological U reduction that is not coupled to carbon
   oxidation.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to test a simplified optical prototype for a
   rapid estimation of the ripening parameters of white grape for
   Franciacorta wine directly in field.
   Spectral acquisition based on reflectance at four wavelengths (630, 690,
   750 and 850 nm) was proposed. The integration of a simple processing
   algorithm in the microcontroller software would allow to visualize real
   time values of spectral reflectance.
   Non-destructive analyses were carried out on 95 grape bunches for a
   total of 475 berries. Samplings were performed weekly during the last
   ripening stages. Optical measurements were carried out both using the
   simplified system and a portable commercial vis/NIR spectrophotometer,
   as reference instrument for performance comparison. Chemometric analyses
   were performed in order to extract the maximum useful information from
   optical data. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed for a
   preliminary evaluation of the data. Correlations between the optical
   data matrix and ripening parameters (total soluble solids content, SSC;
   titratable acidity, TA) were carried out using partial least square
   (PLS) regression for spectra and using multiple linear regression (MLR)
   for data from the simplified device. Classification analysis were also
   performed with the aim of discriminate ripe and unripe samples. PCA, MLR
   and classification analyses show the effectiveness of the simplified
   system in separating samples among different sampling dates and in
   discriminating ripe from unripe samples. Finally, simple equations for
   SSC and TA prediction were calculated. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This article addresses the role of world oil price hike of 2007-08 in
   serving to transform the financial and banking crisis into what is
   commonly referred to the Great Recession. Existing literature on the

   mechanisms and market dynamics in transforming the banking crisis of
   2007-08 into the economic recession of 2008-12/13 Although often
   attributing the global meltdown to wider phenomenon of financialisation,
   rarely do existing perspectives delve into the role of the commodity
   sector in the global credit crunch. In this paper, we aim to fill this

Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{93}},
Pages = {{14-16}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The concept ``treat to target{''} in rheumatology was first developed
   for rheumatoid arthritis. A similar attempt to develop such an approach
   for spondyloarthritis was unsuccessful because the assessment tools and
   target of therapy had not been developed. In psoriatic arthritis (PsA),
   composite indices to assess disease activity, disease state, and
   responsiveness have been developed and can be used as targets. There are
   a number of definitions for remission, but none are widely accepted.
   However, a state of minimal disease activity has been defined. There is
   evidence now that the treat-to-target approach is feasible, using the
   minimal disease activity state as a target and devising a tight control
   approach, which is superior to standard of care. Further work will
   determine the best target and the best approach to reach it.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives:We quantify patterns in prescription opioid dispensations to
   individuals who suffered a prescription opioid-related death. In
   addition, we examine the relationship between opioid dispensations and
   prescription opioid-related deaths in geographic regions of British
   Columbia (BC).Methods:We used population-based administrative data on
   prescription drug dispensations to identify patterns in prescription
   opioid dispensations to individuals who suffered a prescription
   opioid-related death. We also computed the quantity of prescription
   opioids dispensed (morphine equivalents) in small geographic regions in
   BC from 2004 to 2013. We identified prescription opioid-related deaths
   in these small geographic areas using mortality data from BC Vital
   Statistics and investigated the relationship between rates of
   prescription opioid dispensing and rates of prescription opioid death in
   small geographic areas in BC by sex. We examined differences in our
   results when limiting opioid dispensations to strong opioids and weak
   opioids.Results:Many individuals who suffered a prescription
   opioid-related death did not have an active opioid prescription in the
   60 days before death (46\% of women and 71\% of men). Rates of
   prescription opioid dispensing and opioid-related deaths vary
   substantially across geographic regions in BC. The area-level
   relationship between rate of prescription opioid dispensing and rate of
   unintentional prescription opioid-related death is positive and
   statistically significant for both men and women (P<0.001). This
   relationship holds when opioid prescribing is limited to strong
   opioids.Conclusion:Targeted efforts to reduce high levels of opioid
   prescribing in BC, particularly dispensations of strong opioids and
   codeine, may substantially reduce opioid-related harms.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Altitude above sea level and body mass index are
   well-recognized determinants of oxygen saturation in adult populations;
   however, the contribution of these factors to oxygen saturation in
   children is less clear. Objective: To explore the contribution of
   altitude above sea level and body mass index to oxygen saturation in
   children. Methods: A multi-center, cross-sectional study conducted in
   nine cities in Mexico. Parents signed informed consent forms and
   completed a health status questionnaire. Height, weight, and pulse
   oximetry were recorded. Results: We studied 2,200 subjects (52\% girls)
   aged 8.7 +/- 3.0 years. Mean body mass index, z-body mass index, and
   oxygen saturation were 18.1 +/- 3.6 kg.m(-2), 0.58 +/- 1.3, and 95.5 +/-
   2.4\%, respectively. By multiple regression analysis, altitude proved to
   be the main predictor of oxygen saturation, with non-significant
   contributions of age, gender, and body mass index. According to quantile
   regression, the median estimate of oxygen saturation was 98.7 minus
   1.7\% per km of altitude above sea level, and the oxygen saturation
   fifth percentile 97.4 minus 2.7\% per km of altitude. Conclusions:
   Altitude was the main determinant of oxygen saturation, which on average
   decreased 1.7\% per km of elevation from a percentage of 98.7 at sea
   level. In contrast with adults, this study in children found no
   association between oxygen saturation and obesity or age.}},

Abstract = {{To date, substances such as Mildronate (Meldonium) are not on the radar
   of anti-doping laboratories as the compound is not explicitly classified
   as prohibited. However, the anti-ischemic drug Mildronate demonstrates
   an increase in endurance performance of athletes, improved
   rehabilitation after exercise, protection against stress, and enhanced
   activations of central nervous system (CNS) functions.
   In the present study, the existing evidence of Mildronate's usage in
   sport, which is arguably not (exclusively) based on medicinal reasons,
   is corroborated by unequivocal analytical data allowing the estimation
   of the prevalence and extent of misuse in professional sports. Such data
   are vital to support decision-making processes, particularly regarding
   the ban on drugs in sport. Due to the growing body of evidence (black
   market products and athlete statements) concerning its misuse in sport,
   adequate test methods for the reliable identification of Mildronate are
   required, especially since the substance has been added to the 2015
   World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) monitoring program.
   In the present study, two approaches were established using an in-house
   synthesized labelled internal standard (Mildronate-D-3). One aimed at
   the implementation of the analyte into routine doping control screening
   methods to enable its monitoring at the lowest possible additional
   workload for the laboratory, and another that is appropriate for the
   peculiar specifics of the analyte, allowing the unequivocal confirmation
   of findings using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-high
   resolution/high accuracy mass spectrometry (HILIC-HRMS). Here, according
   to applicable regulations in sports drug testing, a full qualitative
   validation was conducted. The assay demonstrated good specificity,
   robustness (rRT=0.3\%), precision (intra-day: 7.0-8.4\%; inter-day:
   9.9-12.9\%), excellent linearity (R>0.99) and an adequate lower limit of
   detection (<10 ng/mL). Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The acquisition of Pseudonzonas aeruginosa in cystic
   fibrosis (CF) is associated with lower survival, decreased lung
   function, worse radiological scores, increased exacerbations and reduced
   nutritional status. Open water is a known reservoir and a potential
   source of exposure to P. aeruginosa.
   Methods: Twenty eight adult CF patients who had no history of P.
   aeruginosa and had negative P. aeruginosa IgG antibody levels, were
   matched by age and sex with 28 CF patients with chronic P. aeruginosa
   colonization. Straight line and closest walking distance from patient's
   residence to the nearest ``blue space{''}, i.e. surface water as
   determined by Google Earth, were compared between the two groups, and
   odds ratios (OR) were estimated using conditional logistic regression.
   Results: Patients who were never infected with P. aeruginosa lived
   significantly further away from a natural water source than P.
   aeruginosa colonized patients, both when considering shortest walking
   distance (mean 487 m vs 308 m, p = 0.014) and beeline (mean 324 m vs 202
   m, p = 0.021). Conditional logistic regression (correcting for FEV1\%)
   revealed ORs for chronic P. aeruginosa colonization of 0.35 (95\% CI
   0.13-0.98; p = 0.045) and 0.12 (95\% CI 0.02-0.81; p = 0.028) for each
   doubling in the beeline or walking distance, respectively, between
   residence and open water.
   Conclusion: We discovered that adult CF patients without P. aeruginosa
   infection live significantly further from blue space than CF patients
   with chronic P. aeruginosa colonization. Within the limitations of a
   case control study, this may indicate that natural open water represents
   a source of infection by P. aeruginosa in CF.

Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Nhumirim virus (NHUV) is an insect-specific virus that phylogenetically
   affiliates with dual-host mosquito-borne flaviviruses. Previous in vitro
   co-infection experiments demonstrated prior or concurrent infection of
   Aedes albopictus C6/36 mosquito cells with NHUV resulted in a
   10,000-fold reduction in viral production of West Nile virus (WNV). This
   interference between WNV and NHUV was observed herein in an additional
   Ae. albopictus mosquito cell line, C7-10. A WNV 2K peptide (V9M) mutant
   capable of superinfection with a pre-established WNV infection
   demonstrated a comparable level of interference from NHUV as the
   parental WNV strain in C6/36 and C7-10 cells. Culex quinquefasciatus and
   Culex pipiens mosquitoes intrathoracically inoculated with NHUV and WNV,
   or solely with WNV as a control, were allowed to extrinsically incubate
   the viruses up to nine and 14 days, respectively, and transmissibility
   and replication of WNV was determined. The proportion of Cx.
   quinquefasciatus mosquitoes capable of transmitting WNV was
   significantly lower for the WNV/NHUV group than the WNV control at seven
   and nine days post inoculation (dpi), while no differences were observed
   in the Cx. pipiens inoculation group. By dpi nine, a 40\% reduction in
   transmissibility in mosquitoes from the dual inoculation group was
   observed compared to the WNV-only control. These data indicate the
   potential that infection of some Culex spp. vectors with NHUV could
   serve as a barrier for efficient transmissibility of flaviviruses
   associated with human disease.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND PURPOSETo characterize relations between configurations
   of the posterior part of the Circle of Willis (CoW) and the occurrence
   of unilateral thalamic infarction.
   METHODSFrom a magnetic resonance imaging report database, we identified
   and analyzed 111 patients with acute isolated unilateral thalamic
   infarction on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Vascular pathologies
   were noted on magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and the diameter of
   the posterior communicating artery (PComA) and the P1 and P2 segments of
   the posterior cerebral artery determined.
   RESULTSMost infarctions were observed in the territory of the
   inferolateral arteries (70.2\%), followed by the paramedian (16.3\%),
   tuberothalamic (8.7\%), and posterior choroidal arteries (4.8\%).
   Relevant vascular pathologies included stenosis of the basilar artery
   (4.5\%), P1 segment stenosis (4.5\%)/occlusion (.9\%), and P2 segment
   stenosis (14.4\%)/occlusion (4.5\%). Paramedian thalamic infarction was
   associated with ipsilateral P1 segment hypoplasia/absence (P < .001);
   tuberothalamic infarction with ipsilateral PComA hypoplasia/absence (P =
   .08). Furthermore, the diameter of the relevant CoW segment was smaller
   in patients with ipsilateral thalamic infarction.
   CONCLUSIONSAssessment of CoW configuration on MRA may be helpful to
   understand the appearance of unilateral thalamic stroke independent from
   stroke etiology. A smaller diameter of the relevant CoW segment might be
   a risk factor for ipsilateral thalamic stroke in the corresponding
   thalamic vascular territory.}},

Abstract = {{With recent technological advances and cost reductions, automated
   embedding systems are rapidly becoming routine in the processing of skin
   biopsy specimens. The efficiency advantages of this technique are due in
   part to the use of patented sectionable cassettes that hold
   formalin-fixed tissue from the time of grossing through tissue
   sectioning. In this process, the final paraffin block contains both the
   tissue and the cassette, which are sectioned and stained in unison.
   Here, we report the multiple tissue and slide artifacts commonly seen
   with automated embedding systems that are unique to this method of
   tissue processing. The most frequently observed tissue changes are
   patterned molding of the biopsy specimen around the cassette material.
   The most common slide artifacts are due to the presence of geometrically
   shaped polarizable cassette material adjacent to or overlying the
   stained tissue. As many of these artifacts strongly resemble the shapes
   seen in the classic 1980s video game, Tetris, we propose the term of
   Tetris-like artifacts for these findings. Although we remain confident
   that use of an automated embedding system does not decrease diagnostic
   reliability, increased familiarity with the standard appearance of
   slides processed using this technique will help avoid confusion when
   evaluating these cases.}},

   bilinear models considering several error process distributions, which
   are chosen according to the kurtosis value. For each one of these error
   process distributions, the class of parameterizations for the
   corresponding bilinear model satisfying Taylor property is obtained. The
   analysis of the relationship between the Taylor property and
   leptokurtosis in these bilinear processes allows to conclude that this
   property is a consequence of heavy tailed model distributions.
   With the goal of extending this research to real valued bilinear models,
   a simulation study is developed in a class of such models with
   symmetrical innovations.}},

Abstract = {{The existing standard enchytraeid reproduction test (ERT) concerns the
   assessment of effects on survival and reproduction. In the present study
   we optimized and propose an embryotoxicity test using Enchytraeus
   crypticus. Cadmium (Cd) was used as a test substance. Endpoints
   evaluated were embryo development, number of embryonic structures,
   Calcium (Ca) channels quantification and hatching success with
   macroscopic monitoring, histological and immunohistochemistry analysis.
   Results showed that Cd is embryotoxic for this species, causing a
   decrease in the hatching success (EC50 = 3.1 mg/kg), a delay or
   disruption in formation of embryonic structures depending on
   concentrations (<5 mg Cd/kg or >= 16 mg Cd/kg). Results from
   immunohistochemistry suggest a competitive binding between Cd and Ca for
   Ca channels, resulting in changes in Ca homeostasis. The use of the E.
   crypticus embryotoxicity test with the combination of histological and
   immunohistological tools provided a good option towards mechanistic
   information enhancing the importance of these tests to evaluate the
   hazard of chemicals and possible use in risk assessment. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel and simple method for the sensitive determination
   of endocrine disrupter compounds octylphenol (OP) and nonylphenol (NP)
   in environmental water samples has been developed using solid-phase
   microextraction (SPME) coupled with gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry. Carboxylated carbon nano-spheres (CNSs-COOH) are used as a
   novel SPME coating via physical adhesion. The CNSs-COOH fiber possessed
   higher adsorption efficiency than 100 mu m polydimethysiloxane (PDMS)
   fiber and was similar to 85 mu m polyacrylate (PA) fiber for the two
   analytes. Important parameters, such as extraction time, pH, agitation
   speed, ionic strength, and desorption temperature and time, were
   investigated and optimized in detail. Under the optimal parameters, the
   developed method achieved low limits of detection of 0.13 similar to
   0.14 ng center dot L-1 and a wide linear range of 1 similar to 1000 ng
   center dot(-1) for OP and NP. The novel method was validated with
   several real environmental water samples, and satisfactory results were

Abstract = {{WRKY comprises a large family of transcription factors in plants, but
   most WRKY members are still poorly understood. In this study, we report
   functional characterization of a Group III WRKY gene (FcWRKY70) from
   Fortunella crassifolia. FcWRKY70 was greatly induced by drought and
   abscisic acid, but slightly or negligibly by salt and cold.
   Overexpression of FcWRKY70 in tobacco (Nicotiana nudicaulis) and lemon
   (Citrus lemon) conferred enhanced tolerance to dehydration and drought
   stresses. Transgenic tobacco and lemon exhibited higher expression
   levels of ADC (arginine decarboxylase), and accumulated larger amount of
   putrescine in comparison with wild type (WT). Treatment with D-arginine,
   an inhibitor of ADC, caused transgenic tobacco plants more sensitive to
   dehydration. Knock-down of FcWRKY70 in kumquat down-regulated ADC
   abundance and decreased putrescine level, accompanied by compromised
   dehydration tolerance. The promoter region of FcADC contained two W-box
   elements, which were shown to be interacted with FcWRKY70. Taken
   together, our data demonstrated that FcWRKY70 functions in drought
   tolerance by, at least partly, promoting production of putrescine via
   regulating ADC expression.}},

Title = {{Association Between Dental Student-Developed Exam Questions and Learning

Abstract = {{New dental accreditation standards emphasize that graduates must be
   competent in the use of critical thinking (a high cognitive-level skill)
   Despite this new standard, most written assessments in dental school
   courses are still based on low cognitive-level questions. The aim of
   this study was to determine if an exercise that allows students to
   collaboratively write exam questions would help cultivate higher
   cognitive levels of learning. To evaluate this exercise at one U.S.
   dental school, the cognitive level (according to Bloom's taxonomy) of
   multiple-choice exam questions and students' scores across two cohorts
   in a cariology course were compared. This evaluation took place using a
   control group in which questions were instructor-generated and an
   intervention group in which students worked in groups to develop
   questions. All students in one first-year class participated in the
   intervention group (n=104); all students in the first-year class two
   years earlier served as the control group (n=106). Among students in the
   intervention group, the response rate to a post-intervention survey
   measuring students' attitudes about the experience was 70\% (N=73). The
   results showed that the students generating their own assessments
   developed higher cognitive-level exam questions than the
   instructor-generated assessments. The intervention group (with
   student-generated assessments) also performed as well or better on tests
   compared to the control group (with instructor-generated assessments).
   In the intervention group survey, the vast majority of students agreed
   that the exercise was helpful for their overall learning experience, but
   working in teams was said to be the least valuable component of the
   activity for their learning. This study suggests that student-driven,
   collaborative assessments can be an important tool for building critical
   thinking skills in dental classrooms and that it may be worthwhile to
   expand this type of exercise into other courses.}},

   acuity (CDVA) after laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) or insertion of
   a posterior chamber Implantable Col lamer Lens phakic intraocular lens
   (pIOL).
   SETTING: Clinica Baviera, Institut Oftalmologico Europeo, Torrevieja
   Hospital, Madrid, Spain.
   DESIGN: Retrospective study.
   METHODS: The study sample included 1310 eyes that had LASIK and 94 that
   had insertion of a pIOL from July 2002 to September 2013. Suboptimal
   preoperative CDVA was defined as equal to logMAR 0.15 or below and
   moderate myopia as a spherical equivalent of -5.0 to -10.0 diopters (D).
   RESULTS: The preoperative mean CDVA was 0.22 logMAR +/- 0.09 (SD) in the
   LASIK group and 0.23 +/- 0.09 logMAR in the pIOL group. Postoperative
   uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) was 0.13 +/- 0.12 logMAR in
   the laser group and 0.12 +/- 0.09 logMAR in the pIOL group, with a
   postoperative CDVA of 0.11 +/- 0.10 logMAR and 0.08 +/- 0.07 logMAR,
   respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Compared with preoperative values, amblyopic eyes with
   moderate myopia having LASIK or implantation of a pIOL demonstrated a
   statistically significant improvement in UDVA and CDVA (P<.001). The
   pIOL group performed significantly better than the LASIK group in terms
   of safety and efficiency. (C) 2015 ASCRS and ESCRS}},

Abstract = {{T-type Ca2+ channels are expressed in the ventricular myocytes of the
   fetal and perinatal heart, but are normally downregulated as development
   progresses. Interestingly, however, these channels are re-expressed in
   adult cardiomyocytes under pathological conditions. We investigated low
   voltage-activated T-type Ca2+ channel regulation in hypoxia in rat
   cardiomyocytes. Molecular studies revealed that hypoxia induces the
   upregulation of Ca(v)3.2mRNA, whereas Ca(v)3.1 mRNA is not significantly
   altered. The effect of hypoxia on Ca(v)3.2mRNA was time- and
   dose-dependent, and required hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1)
   stabilization. Patch-clamp recordings confirmed that T-type Ca2+ channel
   currents were upregulated in hypoxic conditions, and the addition of 50m
   NiCl2 (a T-type channel blocker) demonstrated that the Ca(v)3.2 channel
   is responsible for this upregulation. This increase in current density
   was not accompanied by significant changes in the Ca(v)3.2 channel
   electrophysiological properties. The small monomeric G-protein RhoA and
   its effector Rho-associated kinase I (ROCKI), which are known to play
   important roles in cardiovascular physiology, were also upregulated in
   neonatal rat ventricular myocytes subjected to hypoxia. Pharmacological
   experiments indicated that both proteins were involved in the observed
   upregulation of the Ca(v)3.2 channel and the stabilization of HIF-1 that
   occurred in response to hypoxia. These results suggest a possible role
   for Ca(v)3.2 channels in the increased probability of developing
   arrhythmias observed in ischaemic situations, and in the pathogenesis of
   diseases associated with hypoxic Ca2+ overload.}},

Title = {{Optimal Lifestyle Components in Young Adulthood Are Associated With
   Maintaining the Ideal Cardiovascular Health Profile Into Middle Age}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background-Middle-aged adults with ideal blood pressure, cholesterol,
   and glucose levels exhibit substantially lower cardiovascular mortality
   than those with unfavorable levels. Four healthy lifestyle
   components-optimal body weight, diet, physical activity, and not
   smoking-are recommended for cardiovascular health (CVH). This study
   quantified associations between combinations of healthy lifestyle
   components measured in young adulthood and loss of the ideal CVH profile
   into middle age.
   Methods and Results-Analyses included 2164 young adults in the Coronary
   Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study with the ideal CVH profile
   (defined as untreated blood pressure <120/80 mm Hg, total cholesterol
   <200 mg/dL, fasting blood glucose <100 mg/dL, and absence of
   cardiovascular disease) at baseline. Cox proportional hazards regression
   models estimated hazard ratios for loss of the ideal CVH profile over 25
   years according to 4 individual and 16 combinations of optimal healthy
   lifestyle components measured in young adulthood: body mass index,
   physical activity, nonsmoking status, and diet quality. Models were
   adjusted for age, sex, race, education, study center, and baseline blood
   pressure, cholesterol, and glucose. Eighty percent (n=1737) of
   participants lost the ideal CVH profile by middle age; loss was greatest
   for young adults with no optimal healthy lifestyle components at
   baseline. Relative to young adults with no optimal healthy lifestyle
   components, those with all 4 were less likely to lose the ideal CVH
   profile (hazard ratio 0.59, 95\% CI 0.44-0.80). Combinations that
   included optimal body mass index and nonsmoking status were each
   associated with lower risk.
   Conclusions-Optimal body mass index and not smoking in young adulthood
   were protective against loss of the ideal CVH profile through middle
   age. Importance of diet and physical activity may be included through
   their effects on healthy weight.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) system is a contactless automatic
   identification system using small, low-cost RFID tag to an animate or
   inanimate object. Because of the advantage of simultaneous recognition
   of massive amounts of information, it is expected to replace the
   traditional bar-code system. However, two major issues with an RFID
   system are: i) an adversary can access the tag information, which may
   cause privacy and forgery problems; the computational capability of the
   RFID tags is very limited. Although, to deal with these issues,
   impressive efforts have been made by designing anonymous authentication
   schemes with the help of lightweight cryptographic primitives such as
   one way hash function, symmetric key encryption/decryption,
   exclusive-OR. However, to the best of our knowledge none has succeeded
   so far. In this article, we take an initial step to shed light on the
   rationale underlying this prominent issue. In order to do that, we will
   first demonstrate that the existing lightweight cryptographic primitive
   based anonymous authentication protocols in RFID systems are
   impractical. Subsequently, we propose a realistic lightweight
   authentication protocol for RFID system, which can ensure various
   imperative security properties such as anonymity of the RFID tag,
   untraceability, forward security etc. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The current level of pooling and sharing between fixed and mobile
   infrastructures is not sufficient to allow the most efficient use of
   network resources, whether fixed, mobile, or Wi-Fi. In the perspective
   of 5G networks, efficient resource sharing of fixed and mobile
   infrastructures, called structural convergence, will be essential in the
   path toward an integrated fixed and mobile network. This structural
   convergence is being triggered by different architecture trends, e.g.,
   baseband unit hostelling and mobile fronthaul technologies,
   heterogeneous radio access networks, and, most importantly, a unified
   optical access and aggregation network. The COMBO European project is
   studying architectural options for structural convergence leveraging on
   the aforementioned technological triggers and in particular on the
   evolution of optical access and aggregation technologies. These
   architectural options are described and analyzed with respect to
   anticipated needs for integrated fixed and mobile networks.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a pricingmodel for corporate securities issued by a levered

   While equity holders can default the firm when the earnings become
   insufficient, they may liquidate it by repaying the face value of debt
   when the value of collaterals becomes sufficiently high. Unlike the
   existing models, the bivariate structure enables us to distinguish
   strategic default, liquidity default and ordinary liquidation, which
   makes the contribution of strategic debt service to credit spreads lower

Abstract = {{Selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3 (NH3-SCR) has been widely
   investigated to reduce NOx emissions from combustion processes, which
   cause environmental challenges. However, most of the current work on NOx
   reduction has focused on using feed gas without CO2 or containing small
   amounts of CO2. In the future, oxy-fuel combustion will play an
   important role for power generation, and this process generates high
   concentrations of CO2 in flue gas. Therefore, studies on the SCR process
   under concentrated CO2 atmosphere conditions are important for future
   SCR deployment in oxy-fuel combustion processes. In this work, Mn- and
   Ce-based catalysts using activated carbon as support were used to
   investigate the effect of CO2 on NO conversion. A N-2 atmosphere was
   used for comparison. Different process conditions such as temperature,
   SO2 concentration, H2O content in the feed gas and space velocity were
   studied. Under Mn-Ce/AC conditions, the results suggested that Mn metal
   could reduce the inhibition effect of CO2 on the NO conversion, while Ce
   metal increased the inhibition effect of CO2. High space velocity also
   resulted in a reduction of CO2 inhibition on the NO conversion, although
   the overall performance of SCR was greatly reduced at high space
   velocity. Future investigations to design novel Mn-based catalysts are
   suggested to enhance the SCR performance under concentrated CO2
   atmosphere conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Aim. There is concern over the effect of training on heart function of
   athletes as recorded by 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG). Although ECG
   abnormalities with respect to ethnic origin of black athletes from the
   Caribbean, West Africa and East Africa have been reported, black
   athletes from southern Africa, specifically participating in different
   sports, have never been investigated before. The purpose of this study
   was to analyze the ECG patterns in South African students of Zulu
   descent, who represented our university in boxing (endurance modality)
   and body building (resistance modality) at a regional level.
   Methods. Fifteen subjects each were assigned to an endurance (E),
   resistance (R) or control (C) group, respectively. ECG patterns were
   recorded with a 12-lead ECG.
   Results. Our subjects indicated no significant differences in ECG
   patterns in relation to whether they participate in strength or
   endurance related sport. However, 80\% of the endurance group and 67\%
   of the resistance displayed ECG criteria indicative of left ventricular
   hypertrophy (LVH), group E displays higher R5/S1-wave voltages (E=43.3
   mm; R=36.8 mm; C=37.1 mm) as well distinctly abnormal ECG patterns (E=87
   \%; R=73 \%; C=53 \%), raising clinical suspicion of structural heart
   disease. Our cohort presented with non-significant, marked ST-segment
   elevation (53\% of both the E and R groups) and inverted T-waves in 27\%
   of the E group.
   Conclusion. Similar to findings in other ethnic Africans, a large
   proportion of our Zulu study population displayed ECG criteria
   indicative of LVH on the evidence of a marked increase of R5/S1-wave
   voltage and ST/T-segment changes with no differences in relation to
   whether they participate in strength or endurance related sport.}},

Title = {{Changes in Lateral Comitance After Asymmetric Horizontal Strabismus
   Surgery}},
Journal = {{JAMA OPHTHALMOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{133}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1241-1246}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Asymmetric horizontal strabismus surgery is often performed
   to correct primary gaze alignment without considering the symptoms that
   may result from misalignment in the patient's side gaze. Surgical
   choices influence alignment in side gaze and may contribute to
   functional and social deficits.
   OBJECTIVE To identify the surgical procedures associated with changes of
   alignment in side gaze to help inform surgical planning for patients
   with horizontal strabismus.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The medical records of 1081 horizontal
   strabismus surgical procedures that were performed at Boston Children's
   Hospital during a 2-year period were retrospectively reviewed. Only
   records with strabismus measurements recorded in the right and left gaze
   before and after surgery were included. Data analysis was conducted from
   September 1, 2012, through June 7, 2015.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Change in comitance (CIC), determined by
   measuring the horizontal comitance (the difference between right- and
   left-gaze strabismus measurements) before and after surgery.
   RESULTS The review identified 569 patients who met the inclusion
   criteria. Of the 491 patients with comitant preoperative alignment, 59
   developed postoperative incomitance, of whom 53 (89.9\%) had asymmetric
   surgery. Of the 78 patients with incomitant preoperative alignment, 36
   patients' (46.2\%) deviation had improved to comitance after surgery; 32
   (88.9\%) of these patients had asymmetric surgery. Asymmetric 2-muscle
   surgery had a median CIC of 4.0 while symmetric 2-muscle surgery had a
   median CIC of 1.5 (difference in CIC, 2.5; 95\% CI, 2.0-3.0; P < .001).
   A CIC of 25 prism diopters or more was observed in 6 patients who
   underwent asymmetric surgery (0 with symmetric surgery). New
   postoperative incomitance was symptomatic in at least 17 patients
   (28.8\%).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Asymmetric strabismus surgery can treat
   incomitant deviations, but it can also create symptomatic incomitant
   deviations in patients who were previously comitant. Surgical planning
   should include consideration of the potential for CIC, including the
   potential for unsatisfactory appearance in side gaze. Patients with
   binocular vision will be sensitive to diplopia in any gaze direction; in
   such cases, the consequences of asymmetric surgery should be considered
   with particular care.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents application of satellite interferometric methods
   (persistent scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PSInSAR
   (TM)) and differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar
   (DInSAR)) for observation of ground deformation in the Upper Silesian
   Coal Basin (USCB) in Southern Poland. The presented results were
   obtained during the DORIS project (EC FP 7, Grant Agreement n. 242212,
   www.doris-project.euRefTarget
   Address={''}http://www.doris-project.eu{''} TargetType={''}URL{''}/).
   Several InSAR datasets for this area were analysed. Most of them were
   processed by Tele-Rilevamento Europa - T.R.E. s.r.l. Italy. Datasets
   came from different SAR satellites (ERS 1 and 2, Envisat, ALOS- PALSAR
   and TerraSAR-X) and cover three different SAR bands (L, C and X). They
   were processed using both InSAR techniques: DInSAR, where deformations
   are presented as interferometric fringes on the raster image, and
   PSInSAR, where motion is indentified on irregular set of persistent
   scatterer (PS) points. Archival data from the C-band European Space
   Agency satellites ERS and ENVISAT provided information about ground
   movement since 1992 until 2010 in two separate datasets (1992-2000 and
   2003-2010). Two coal mines were selected as examples of ground motion
   within inactive mining areas: Sosnowiec and Saturn, where mining ceased
   in 1995 and 1997, respectively. Despite well pumping after closure of
   the mines, groundwater rose several dozen meters, returning to its
   natural horizon. Small surface uplift clearly indicated on satellite
   interferometric data is related to high permeability of the
   hydrogeological subregion and insufficient water withdrawal from
   abandoned mines. The older 1992-2000 PSInSAR dataset indicates values of
   ground motion ranging from -40.0 to 0.0 mm. The newer 2003-2010 dataset
   shows values ranging from -2.0 to +7.0 mm. This means that during this
   period of time subsidence was less and uplift greater in comparison to
   the older dataset. This is even more evident in the time series of
   randomly selected PS points from both coal mines. The presence of
   bentonite deposits in the Saturn coal mine can also have influence on
   the ground surface uplift. Analysis of interferometric L and X-band data
   in Upper Silesia has enabled observation and monitoring of the
   underground mining front for several months. It was indicated by the
   example from the Halemba-Wirek coal mine. Analysis of the TerraSAR-X
   dataset processed by SqueeSAR algorithms proved to be the most effective
   for this purpose. X-band persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) time
   series can help to indentify small seemingly negligible movements and
   are successfully supplemented by fringes when displacement becomes
   significant. Differential interferograms from the L-band dataset detect
   similar displacement values but, thanks to longer wavelength, are
   characterized by better coherence, especially in the middle of the
   subsidence trough. Results on ground deformation proved that ground
   motion above abandoned mines continues long after their closure.
   Therefore, existing regulations stating that abandoned mines are
   considered fully safe five years after mine closure should change.
   Moreover, it should be emphasised that construction in these areas
   should be avoided due to existing potential risks.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate whether expectations that are not fully rational have the
   potential to explain the evolution of house prices and the price-to-rent
   ratio in the United States. First, a stylized asset-pricing model solved
   under rational expectations is used to derive a fundamental value for
   house prices and the price-rent ratio. Although the model can explain
   the sample average of the price-rent ratio, it does not generate the
   large and persistent fluctuations observed in the data. Then, we
   consider a rational bubble solution, an extrapolative expectations
   solution and a near rational bubble solution. In this last solution
   agents extrapolate the future from the latest realizations and the
   degree of extrapolation is stronger in good times than in bad times,
   generating waves of over-optimism. We show that under this solution the
   model not only is able to match key moments of the data but can also
   replicate the run up in the US. house prices observed over the 2000-2006

Abstract = {{This study investigates the conformance quality benefits of colocating

   from a panel data set of U.S.-based pharmaceutical plants over a 13-year

   better conformance quality, on average, across the entire sample. We
   find that these benefits of colocation persist throughout the time
   period we study (1994-2007), which is surprising, given the rapid
   development of information and communication technologies during that
   time. These benefits are particularly enhanced for manufacturing plants
   operating with processes that involve a high level of tacit process
   knowledge and that belong to large firms. Our findings highlight the
   importance of matching organizational design with process and firm
   characteristics in settings involving knowledge interdependence. They
   also highlight the continued value of physical proximity through

Abstract = {{Antibiotic misuse and overuse in both the healthcare and agricultural
   fields have dramatically increased the prevalence of antibiotic
   resistance in human pathogens. Two strains of methicillin-resistant
   Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (ATCC 43330 and a wild-type) and 1 strain
   of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (ATCC 25923) were challenged (9
   runs in triplicate) in a preliminary study with ultraviolet germicidal
   irradiation (UVGI) doses ranging from 0.25 to 3.00 mJ/cm(2). The mean
   percent kill was calculated for each strain when compared with the
   control plates (no exposure to UVGI). Then, each strain was challenged
   (22 runs in triplicate) with UVGI doses of 2.00, 2.50, and 3.00
   mJ/cm(2). The results suggest a difference between the doses required to
   disinfect surfaces with each strain. Assuming a standard error rate of

Abstract = {{Mesospheric bores have been observed and measured in the mesopause
   region near 100-km altitude, where they propagate horizontally along a
   duct of relatively strong density stratification. Here, a weakly
   nonlinear theory is developed for the description of these mesospheric
   bores. It extends previous theories by allowing internal gravity wave
   radiation from the duct into the surrounding stratified regions, which
   are formally assumed to be weakly stratified. The radiation away from
   the duct is expected to be important for bore energetics. The theory is
   compared with a numerical simulation of the full Navier-Stokes equations
   in the Boussinesq approximation. Two initial conditions are considered.
   The first is a solitary wave solution that would propagate without
   change of form if the region outside the duct were unstratified. The
   second is a sinusoid that evolves into an undular bore. The main
   conclusion is that, while solitary waves and undular bores decay by
   radiation from the duct, they can survive as significant structures over
   sufficiently long periods (similar to 100 min) to be observable.}},

Journal = {{RESTORATION ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Community assembly filters, which in theory determine the suite of
   species that arrive at and establish in a community, have tremendous
   conceptual relevance to restoration. However, the concept has remained
   largely theoretical, with a paucity of empirical tests. As such, the
   applicability of assembly filters theory to ecological restoration
   remains incompletely known. We tested the relative strengths of
   dispersal and establishment filters by comparing the plant species
   composition, measured by species' presence/absence, in 29 restored
   prairies with the seed mixes used to restore each prairie. We found that
   both establishment and dispersal filters limited prairie similarity to
   the seed mix. Sown species responded differentially to filters, with a
   few species limited only by dispersal (seed density), many others
   limited only by establishment conditions (i.e. organic matter and sand
   content of soils, land use history, and fire frequency), and others
   limited by both dispersal and establishment filters. A few species,
   typically those sown most often, were not restricted by dispersal or
   establishment filters, likely because they were sown in high enough
   densities and all sites had suitable environmental conditions. Finally,
   one group of species established poorly, but we could not attribute this
   to either dispersal or establishment filters. This information can help
   land managers select species likely to establish in restorations when
   sown at sufficient densities. These results illustrate that dispersal
   and establishment filters limit the establishment of species in restored
   communities and these filters are species-dependent. Identifying the
   most limiting filter(s) for species will inform strategies to increase
   their establishment success.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The way a construct is measured can differ across cohort
   study visits, complicating longitudinal comparisons. We demonstrated the
   use of factor analysis to link differing cognitive test batteries over
   visits to common metrics representing general cognitive performance,
   memory, executive functioning, and language.
   Methods: We used data from three visits (over 26 years) of the
   Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Neurocognitive Study (N = 14,252).
   We allowed individual tests to contribute information differentially by
   race, an important factor to consider in cognitive aging. Using
   generalized estimating equations, we compared associations of diabetes
   with cognitive change using general and domain-specific factor scores
   versus averages of equally weighted standardized test scores.
   Results: Factor scores provided stronger associations with diabetes at
   the expense of greater variability around estimates (e.g., for general
   cognitive performance, -0.064 standard deviation units/year, standard
   error = 0.015, vs. -0.041 standard deviation units/year, standard error
   = 0.014), which is consistent with the notion that factor scores more
   explicitly address error in measuring assessed traits than averages of
   standardized tests.
   Conclusions: Factor analysis facilitates use of all available data when
   measures change over time, and further, it allows objective evaluation
   and correction for differential item functioning.}},

Abstract = {{Moist irregular wood chips or wood bark are used in packed beds for
   reducing odour and other gaseous emissions from waste gases. Moisture
   control of packing materials is essential for effective waste gas
   treatment. Therefore, simple experiments have been carried out to
   determine the influence of moisture content in a biofiltration bed made
   up of a mixture of irregular wood chips and wood bark in proportion
   50:50 by mass on the pressure drop of air flowing through that bed. Nine
   moisture content levels varying from 8.1\% to 64.5\% (w.b.) were tested.
   The limiting empty bed residence time (EBRT) has been determined for
   each level. The influence of moisture content on true density, porosity
   and specific surface of the bed was determined. Above the moisture
   content of 28.3\% (w.b.) there was a drastic change in the physical
   parameters of the biofilter packing. For moisture contents <= 28.3\%
   (w.b.) the pressure drop increased slightly, while at values greater
   than 28.3\% (w.b.) the opposite trend was observed. The Ergun equation
   was used to describe the relationship between the pressure drop through
   the bed and the superficial air velocity. For moisture contents <=
   28.3\% (w.b.) an approximate Ergun-type equation was proposed to
   describe pressure drop through the bed and the superficial air velocity.

Abstract = {{One promising avenue toward a better understanding of the
   pathophysiology of positive emotional disturbances is to examine
   high-frequency heart rate variability (HRV-HF), which has been
   implicated as a potential physiological index of disturbances in
   positive emotional functioning. To date, only a few psychopathology
   relevant studies have systematically quantified HRV-HF profiles using
   more ecologically valid methods in everyday life. Using an
   experience-sampling approach, the present study examined both mean
   levels and intra-individual variability of HRV-HF - as well as
   comparison measures of cardiovascular arousal, sympathetic activity, and
   gross somatic movement - in everyday life, using ambulatory
   psychophysiological measurement across a six-day consecutive period
   among a spectrum of community adult participants with varying degrees of
   positive valence system disturbance, including adults with bipolar I
   disorder (BD; n = 21), major depressive disorder (MDD; n = 17), and
   healthy non-psychiatric controls (CTL; n = 28). Groups did not differ in
   mean HRV-HF, but greater HRV-HF instability (i.e., intra-individual
   variation in HRV-HF) was found in the BD compared to both MDD and CTL
   groups. Subsequent analyses suggested that group differences in HRV-HF
   variability were largely accounted for by variations in clinician-rated
   manic symptoms. However, no association was found between HRV-HF
   variability and dimensional measures of positive affectivity. This work
   provides evidence consistent with a quadratic relationship between
   HRV-HF and positive emotional disturbance and represents a valuable step
   toward developing a more ecologically valid model of positive valence
   system disturbances and their underlying psychophysiological mechanisms
   within an RDoC framework. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{11}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Recent advances in planning techniques for partially observable Markov
   decision processes (POMDPs) have focused on online search techniques and
   offline point-based value iteration. While these techniques allow
   practitioners to obtain policies for fairly large problems, they assume
   that a nonnegligible amount of computation can be done between each
   decision point. In contrast, the recent proliferation of mobile and
   embedded devices has lead to a surge of applications that could benefit
   from state-of-the-art planning techniques if they can operate under
   severe constraints on computational resources. To that effect, we
   describe two techniques to compile policies into controllers that can be
   executed by a mere table lookup at each decision point. The first
   approach compiles policies induced by a set of alpha vectors (such as
   those obtained by point-based techniques) into approximately equivalent
   controllers, while the second approach performs a simulation to compile
   arbitrary policies into approximately equivalent controllers. We also
   describe an approach to compress controllers by removing redundant and
   dominated nodes, often yielding smaller and yet better controllers.
   Further compression and higher value can sometimes be obtained by
   considering stochastic controllers. The compilation and compression
   techniques are demonstrated on benchmark problems as well as a mobile
   application to help persons with Alzheimer's to way-find. The battery
   consumption of several POMDP policies is compared against finite-state
   controllers learned using methods introduced in this paper. Experiments
   performed on the Nexus 4 phone show that finite-state controllers are
   the least battery consuming POMDP policies.}},

Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Optimizing the photochemistry in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) photoresists
   due to EUV exposures may enable faster, more efficient resists, leading
   to a greater throughput in manufacturing. Since the fundamental reaction
   mechanisms in EUV resists are believed to be due to electron
   interactions after incident 92 eV photons (13.5 nm) generate
   photoelectrons during ionization events, understanding how these
   photoelectrons interact with resist components is critical for
   optimizing the performance of EUV resists and EUV lithography as a
   whole. The authors will present an experimental method to measure the
   cross section of incident electron induced decomposition of three
   different photoacid generators (PAGs). To study the photoelectrons
   generated by the EUV absorption and measure their effect within resists,
   photoresists were exposed to electron beams at electron energies between
   80 and 250 eV. The reactions between PAG molecules and electrons were
   measured by using a mass spectrometer to monitor the levels of small
   molecules produced by PAG decomposition that outgassed from the
   photoresist. This methodology allowed us to determine the number of PAG
   molecules decomposed per incident electron. By combining this result
   with the average penetration depth of an electron at a given energy, the
   cross sections of PAG molecules were determined for energies ranging
   between 80 and 250 eV. Comparing the cross sections of PAG molecules can
   provide insight into the relationship between chemical structure,
   reactivity to the electrons, and trends in cross section versus electron
   energy. This research is a part of a larger SEMATECH research program to
   understand the fundamentals of resist exposures to help in the
   development of new, better performing EUV resists. (C) 2015 American

Abstract = {{We introduce efficient approaches to construct high order finite
   difference discretizations for solving partial differential equations,
   based on a composite grid hierarchy. We introduce a modification of the
   traditional point clustering algorithm, obtained by adding restrictive
   parameters that control the minimal patch length and the size of the
   buffer zone. As a result, a reduction in the number of interfacial cells
   is observed. Based on a reasonable geometric grid setting, we discuss a
   general approach for the construction of stencils in a composite grid
   environment. The straightforward approach leads to an ill-posed problem.
   In our approach we regularize this problem, and transform it into
   solving a symmetric system of linear of equations. Finally, a stencil
   repository has been designed to further reduce computational overhead.
   The effectiveness of the discretizations is illustrated by numerical
   experiments on second order elliptic differential equations.}},

Abstract = {{This study uses local maximum likelihood (LML) methods recently proposed
   by Kumbhakar et al. (2007) to assess the technical efficiency of arable
   crop Kansas farms. LML techniques overcome the most relevant limitations
   associated to mainstream parametric stochastic and nonparametric
   frontier models. LML allows deriving farm-level frontier parameter
   estimates. The relevance of using localized estimates is evidenced by
   the observed heterogeneity in production technologies. Technical
   efficiency scores derived from the LML approach {[}0.905] are higher
   than those of the DEA model under CRS {[}0.808] and SFA {[}0.804] and
   close to DEA-VRS {[}0.917] ratings. Deriving reliable information about
   farm efficiency performance is relevant to identify inefficient farms
   and define adequate policy and management strategies. The use of refined
   methods has thus important implications.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF DESIGN HISTORY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{28}},

Pages = {{405-426}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This article studies the surfaces and shapes of coin-op arcade video
   game machine cabinets produced within the USA between 1971 and 1979 to
   demonstrate how design played a constitutive role in defining `the
   game'. Such a focus highlights how the cabinet designs of Nutting
   Associate's Computer Space (1971) and Atari's Pong (1972) differentiated
   the nascent medium from presiding forms of public amusement, namely
   pinball and electromechanical games, to expand the market for coin-op
   machines. In addition, restricting the article's interest to a period
   before the arcade video game `craze' hit full swing with its major
   `stars' on the near horizon and with the design paradigms of older games
   still prevalent, provides a look into machines for which cabinets played
   a much larger role in `filling in the gaps' when color monitors and
   multicolored graphics were not standard. My disassembly of Boot Hill
   (Midway, 1977) and Warrior (Vectorbeam, 1979) offers concrete examples
   of the cabinet's role in shaping the game when the modified televisions
   behind the bezel still radiated in black and white. The article closes
   by drawing a brief parallel between disciplinary debates that have
   shaped Design History with those that are currently forming the emergent
   area of Game History.}},

Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{310-322}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The Talampaya Formation is the basal unit of the Ischigualasto-Villa
   Union rift system and has been traditionally assigned to the Triassic
   based on stratigraphic relationships. A median U-Pb age of 25238
   (+1-0.091-0.22) Ma was obtained from volcanic zircons collected from a
   tuff bed close to the top of this unit at the Bordo Atravesado locality
   in the Cuesta de Miranda area (La Rioja, Argentina). This radiometric
   age is very close to the accepted Permian Triassic boundary indicating
   that, at least in this locality, sedimentation occurred during the Late
   Permian but may have extended into the earliest Triassic. This new
   evidence indicates that the onset of the extensional event that gave
   rise to the rift basins in western Argentina started during the Permian.
   Detailed sedimentological studies of the 260 m thick Talampaya Formation
   allowed subdividing the succession into seven fades associations grouped
   into three evolutionary stages indicating that sedimentary environments
   initially evolved from alluvial fans to a braided river system.
   Subsequent intrabasinal volcanism associated with sediment deposition by
   low-to moderate-sinuosity rivers is recorded in the lower third of the
   column. The middle and upper part of the unit captures the evolution
   from ephemeral fluvial systems with an eolian interval to an ephemeral
   clastic lake with intermittent volcanic ash deposits. These changes
   indicate a progressive lowering of the landscape and a transition
   towards arid or semiarid conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: The number of patients with end-stage cardiac failure who
   are waiting for transplant has been increasing, although number of heart
   donations stays limited. This has resulted in an increased use of left
   ventricular assist devices. Here, we present results of patients who
   received left ventricular assist device implants at Baskent University
   Ankara Hospital.
   Materials and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 24 patients who
   received a HeartWare left ventricular assist device (HeartWare Inc,
   Framingham, MA, USA) between April 2012 and February 2015; 2 patients
   (8.33\%) were female.
   Results: Patients had end-stage heart failure as a result of the
   following causes: 11 patients (45\%) had ischemic cardiomyopathy, 12
   patients (50\%) had dilated cardiomyopathy, and 1 patient (4.1\%) had
   acute myocarditis. Regarding use of the left ventricular assist device,
   10 patients (41.6\%) had the device as destination therapy, and the
   remaining 14 patients (48.6\%) had it as bridge to transplant. The
   Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support
   Profile was 1 for 3 patients (12.5\%), 2 for 9 patients (37.5\%), and 3
   for 12 patients (50\%). Mean follow-up was 239.8 days, and the mortality
   rate was 33.3\% (8 patients died). During follow-up, we found that 3
   patients (12.5\%) had received a heart transplant and 1 patient (4.1\%)
   eventually recovered, with the device extracted. Six patients had
   driveline infections, and 3 patients had cerebrovascular events.
   Conclusions: With the insufficient number of cardiac donors, use of a
   left ventricular assist device for patients with end-stage cardiac
   failure who are awaiting transplant may be the best option.}},

Abstract = {{The assessment of sub-lethal effects is important to interpret the
   overall insecticide efficacy in controlling insect pest populations. In
   addition to the lethal effect, sub-lethal effects may also occur in
   exposed insects. Vegetative insecticidal proteins (Vips) have shown a
   broad spectrum of insecticidal activity against many insect pest
   species. In this study the sub-lethal effects of the Bacillus
   thuringiensis vegetative insecticidal toxin Vip3A on the development and
   reproduction of Heliothis virescens F. and Plutella xylostella L. were
   evaluated in the laboratory. The results indicated that the sub-lethal
   concentration of Vip3A increased the duration of the larval and pupal
   stages as compared with the control treatment for both species. The
   percent pupation and percent adult emergence were significantly lower
   for Vip3A-treated insects. The proportion of pairs that produced eggs
   and the longevity of adults were not significantly different between
   treatments. H. virescens and P. xylostella treated with Vip3A showed an
   11 and 17 \% decrease in their intrinsic rate of increase (r(m))
   respectively compared with untreated insects. The results from this
   study will be helpful to develop the strategy to incorporate Vip 3A
   containing crops in an integrated pest management programme.}},

Abstract = {{Compression properties in three orthotropic directions for some
   important Turkish wood species, including Calabrian pine (Pinus brutia
   Ten.), Taurus cedar (Cedrus libani), Oriental beech (Fagus orientalis),
   and sessile oak degrees (Quercus petraea), were studied using non-
   destructive and destructive techniques. The materials used in the study
   consisted of 720 small clear specimens of nominal dimensions of 20 x 20
   x 60 mm. The influence of equilibrium moisture content (EMC) was studied
   over four batches of 15 specimens each, conditioned for six to eight
   weeks before testing at a temperature of 20 +/- 2 degrees C and at four
   different relative humidity conditions (50\%, 65\%, 85\%, and 95\%).
   Time of flight values were measured with a commercial ultrasonic tester.
   Using the time results from the ultrasound device, the wave velocities
   (length/time) and E-dyn values were calculated. Samples were also tested
   in uniaxial compression to determine the Young's modulus and compression
   strength values in three orthotropic directions. The E-dyn correlated
   well with the Young's modulus and compression strength of the specimens;
   coefficients of determination ranged between 0.75 and 0.96. Moisture
   content seems to have more influence than density on sound velocities.

Abstract = {{Unlike previous research based on structural or reduced-form models, we
   investigate the importance of a non-default factor for credit default
   swap (CDS) valuation by conducting non-parametric local linear
   regression analyses using corporate CDS data from 2002 to 2011. We find
   that a model with an additional non-default factor significantly
   outperforms a model with only a default factor, both in-sample and
   out-of-sample, particularly for low credit rating CDS spreads. This
   improvement is robust to both credit rating and maturity. Our findings
   support the idea that non-default risk is priced in CDS spreads and help
   explain CDS valuation. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Jrl Fut Mark

   reaction time, and reaction temperature on the phase composition,
   static, and millimeter (mm)-wave magnetic properties of BaFe12O19 were
   studied. Phase composition analysis shows that non-stoichiometric and

   high purity under the optimized synthesis condition. Otherwise, the
   products should contain the trace of either alpha-Fe2O3 impurity phase
   or Fe3O4 transitional phase. It is found that the saturation
   magnetization (30-50 emu/g) and the coercivity values (300-600 Oe) of
   all the samples lie in the range of bulk BaM hexaferrite. The frequency
   dependence of the complex permeability of BaM composites has been
   studied in the Ka-band (26.5-40 GHz). With ferromagnetic resonance

Abstract = {{The putative Co-type nitrile hydratase (NHaseK, consisting of alpha- and
   beta-subunits) genes and the putative activator (17K) gene adjacent to
   the beta subunit region were cloned from Klebsiella oxytoca KCTC 1686.
   17K is essential for the functional expression of recombinant NHaseK in
   Escherichia coli; however, the expression level of 17K was very low when
   the 17K gene and NHaseK structural genes were expressed as a gene
   cluster in E. coli BL21(DE3). To improve the 17K expression level and
   NHaseK activity, the expression cassette was redesigned by placing the
   17K gene and NHaseK structural genes under the control of different
   promoters in the pETDuet-1 expression vector, co-expressing the 17K gene
   with the gene cluster in a double plasmid or a single plasmid with a
   double promoter, and introducing an efficient Shine- Dalgarno sequence
   5' to the17K gene. The specific activity of NHaseK was improved when 17K
   was co-expressed with the gene cluster, whereas the production of NHaseK
   protein decreased. The maximum activity was achieved when an efficient
   Shine-Dalgarno sequence was introduced 5' to the 17K gene: the
   expression level of 17K was significantly improved and the expression
   level of NHaseK did not decrease significantly. The maximum activity was
   about 63,480 +/- 1915.6 U/L broth towards 3-Cyanopyridine. Recombinant
   NHaseK could hydrolyze a wide range of aliphatic, aromatic, and
   heterocyclic nitriles, and convert racemic nitriles to the corresponding
   S-amides, with E values ranging from 9 to 17. The enzyme had a
   temperature optimum of 35A degrees C and exhibited remarkably stability
   below 35A degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{Potentials of alkaline-thermal (ALT) pre-treated sludge as a
   bioflocculant were studied in sludge dewatering and swine wastewater
   pretreatment. When incubated with this ALT pre-treated sludge, dry
   solids (DS) and specific resistance to filtration (SRF) of typical
   wastewater activated sludge reached 22.5\% and 3.4 x 10(12) m/kg,
   respectively, which were much better than that obtained with
   conventional chemical flocculants. Sludge dewatering was further
   improved when both the bioflocculant and conventional polyaluminum
   chloride (PAC) were used simultaneously. Charge neutralization and
   inter-particle bridging were proposed as the reasons for the enhanced
   performance in the case of the combined use. With swine wastewater, the
   bioflocculant could remove COD, ammonium and turbidity by 45.2\%, 41.8\%
   and 74.6\% when incubated with 20 mg/L at pH 8.0. This study suggested
   that the ALT pre-treated sludge has a great potential as an alternative

Abstract = {{Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and the receptor, GHRHR,
   constitute important components of the hypothalamus-pituitary growth
   axis and act on the downstream growth hormone (GH). PACAP-related
   peptide/pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PRP-PACAP)
   is a paralog of GHRH. These genes all play key roles in development and
   growth patterns. To improve the quality of cultured fish strains,
   natural genetic variation must be examined and understood. A mixed
   linear model has been widely used in association mapping, taking the
   population structures and pairwise kinship patterns into consideration.
   In this study, a mass cross population of orange-spotted grouper
   (Epinephelus coioides) was examined. These candidate genes were found to
   harbor low nucleotide diversity ((w) from 0.00154 to 0.00388) and
   linkage disequilibrium levels (delay of 50\% within 2 kbp). Association
   mapping was employed, and two single-nucleotide polymorphisms
   (KR269823.1:g.475A>C and KR269823.1:g.2143T>C) were found to be
   associated with growth (false discovery rate Q < 0.05), explaining
   9.0\%-17.0\% of the phenotypic variance. The association of
   KR269823.1:g.2143T>C was also found via haplotype-based association (p <
   0.05). The identified associations offer new insights into gene
   functions, and the associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may
   be used for breeding purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Aberrant methylation of the breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1)
   promoter is a mechanism for its functional inactivation. It may
   potentially be used as a prognostic marker in studies for patients with
   breast cancer and plays an important role in tumorigenesis. Numerous
   studies have suggested that the methylation of the BRCA1 promoter is
   associated with the prognosis of breast cancer. However, the prognosis
   of BRCA1 promoter methylation in breast cancer patients of different
   ethnicities remains ambiguous. The present meta-analysis was performed
   to adjust and augment a previously published study, which estimated the
   correlations between promoter methylation of BRCA1 and the clinical
   outcomes of breast cancer patients. These results indicated that BRCA1
   methylation was significantly correlated with a poor prognosis of breast
   cancer, particularly for Asian patients, but the correlation was
   over-estimated in the previous study. The combined hazard ratios (HRs)
   in the present study were 1.76 (1.15-2.68) and 1.97 (1.12-3.44) for
   univariate and multivariate analysis of overall survival, which were
   different from 2.02 (1.35-3.03) and 1.38 (1.04-1.84) in the previous
   study. For studies of disease-free survival, the univariate and
   multivariate analyses also have different pooled HRs: 2.89 (1.73-4.83)
   and 3.92 (1.49-10.32) in the previously published study and 1.28
   (0.68-2.43) and 1.64 (0.64-4.19) in the present study. In addition, the
   BRCA1 promoter regions used to detect the hypermethylation were
   different. All the studies using the Baldwin's primer reported that
   breast cancer patients with BRCA1 promoter methylation had a better
   prognosis. There were also correlations between BRCA1 promoter
   methylation and receptor-negativity of the estrogen receptors,
   progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and a
   triple-negative status. Patients with the estrogen, progesterone and
   epidermal growth factor-related receptor-negative status were more
   likely to be negative for the BRCA1 protein.}},

Abstract = {{This research investigated application of tap water prepared by the
   electrochemical method with the PbO2 electrode in air-conditioner
   ex-situ disinfection. Influences of different factors on disinfection
   effects were analyzed. Results show chloride concentration,
   electro-conductivity, voltage and bacteria species affected disinfection
   performance conspicuously but pH and the time after electrolysis
   presented little effects on it. Total bacteria elimination with the
   method was quick and could be achieved, under specific conditions, in 50
   s and 60 s for Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus
   (SA), respectively. In addition, erosion was not observed on air
   conditioner surface. This method was found to possess the anti bacteria
   re-growth ability after disinfection. Overall energy consumption was
   evaluated as 1.336 kWh.m-(3) and considered economic in application.
   This method presents a promising approach for air-conditioner
   disinfection.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundTo investigate the asymmetry of quantitative cerebral blood
   flow (CBF) values in interictal temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients
   with (TLE-MTS) and without (TLE-no) mesial temporal sclerosis.
   MethodsTwenty-six TLE patients (14 TLE-MTS/12 TLE-no) and 22 controls
   were studied with a three-dimensional whole-brain pseudocontinuous
   arterial spin-labeling technique at 3.0 Tesla. Regions of interest were
   placed at the bilateral hippocampal heads, amygdalas and temporal lobes
   to get the average regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and calculate
   asymmetry indices (AIs). Statistical parametric mapping detected the
   whole-brain CBF changes of the two subgroups (right-sided).
   ResultsAIs of the hippocampus and amygdala in TLE-MTS and AIs of
   hippocampus in TLE-no were significantly different versus controls
   (P<0.001, P=0.001, and P=0.013). The lateralizing sensitivity increased
   to 96.154\% by combining structural MRI and AIs of rCBF with optimal
   cutoff values. Hypoperfusion regions in the right TLE-MTS mainly
   clustered in the bilateral temporal lobes, frontal lobes, insular lobes,
   and left caudate nucleus. The right TLE-no showed hypoperfusion in the
   bilateral temporal lobes, frontal lobes, right insular lobe, parietal
   lobe, occipital lobe, and caudate nucleus.
   ConclusionAsymmetry of CBF in the TLE-MTS and TLE-no is different and
   improves MRI performance in lateralizing the TLE. J. Magn. Reson.

Abstract = {{Tungsten disulfide (WS2) is a two-dimensional transition metal
   dichalcogenide, which is of particular interest because it has highly
   anisotropic bonding, which leads to strongly anisotropic electrical and
   mechanical properties. Thus, in this work, a simple hydrothermal process
   was developed to produce photoluminescence from WS2 dots. This was
   achieved in the presence of sodium tungstate and reduced L-glutathione;
   the emitted fluorescence produced a quantum yield as high as 0.066. The
   WS2 dots and the associated fluorescence were investigated with the use
   of transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared and UV-vis
   spectroscopies. The WS2 dots were used as a fluorescent probe to analyze
   nitrofurazone (NFZ). The associated fluorescence resonance energy
   transfer (FRET) mechanism was also investigated and the emitted
   fluorescence was found to be linear in the range of 0.17-166 mu mol L-1
   with a detection limit of 0.055 mu mol L-1. The proposed method was
   successfully applied for analysis of NFZ in nasal drops and water
   samples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To reduce power consumption of wireless transmitters, the transmission
   power level of RF power amplifiers (PAs) may dynamically change
   according to real-time data traffic. This leads that the existing
   digital predistortion (DPD) techniques cannot be directly employed
   because they are mainly suitable for eliminating distortion induced by
   the PAs operated at a relatively stable condition, e.g., at a constant
   average power level. To resolve this problem, a power adaptive DPD is
   proposed in this paper. By accurately modeling the behavior change
   pattern of the PA with the input power adjustments and embedding it into
   the DPD model, the proposed DPD system is able to adjust its
   coefficients to adapt to the behavior variation of the PA induced by the
   power adjustments without real-time recalibration. A low-complexity
   online coefficients updating method is also proposed to track the
   behavior change of the PA caused by other factors, such as bias shifting
   or temperature variation, during real-time operation. Measurements with
   a high power LDMOS Doherty PA have been used to validate the proposed
   approach. Results show that the proposed DPD and its coefficients
   updating approach can produce excellent performance with very low
   complexity compared to the conventional approaches.}},

   article and the difficulties in getting it published; the relationship
   of the article to postcolonial scholarship, subaltern studies, feminist
   studies, and the then emerging literature on globalization; its
   relationship with other theorists of the state through themes such as
   Eurocentrism, reification, fantasy, fetishism, and the role of culture
   in the analysis of the state; and future directions in research on the
   state, among them, examining emotion and affect, studying the most

Abstract = {{When we make errors, we tend to experience a negative emotional state.
   In addition, if our errors are witnessed by other people, we might
   expect those observers to respond negatively. However, little is known
   about how implicit social feedback like facial expressions influences
   error processing. We explored this using the cognitive control
   phenomenon of post-error slowing: the tendency to slow the response
   immediately following an error. Adult participants performed a difficult
   perceptual task: estimating which of two lines (horizontal or vertical)
   was longer. The background showed an irrelevant distractor face with a
   happy, sad, or neutral expression. Participants slowed after errors only
   when the subsequent distractor face was happy, but not when the
   subsequent distractor was sad or neutral nor when a happy face followed
   a correct response. This suggests that information about others' affect,
   even non-interactive, task-irrelevant information, has performance- and
   valence-dependent effects on adaptive cognitive control.}},

Abstract = {{We propose that the alteration of oxidative events due to perturbation
   in steady-state level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), resultant of
   irradiation under lights of specific wavelength(s) generated by
   light-emitting diodes (LEDs), regulates shoot regeneration potential of
   Curculigo orchioides. The changes in the oxidative response induced by
   LEDs were studied, using red (630 nm), blue (470 nm) and their
   combination (1: 1) as light sources, by estimating the changes in
   endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content, the level of lipid
   peroxidation and the activities of antioxidative enzymes during shoot
   organogenesis. After irradiating for 28 days, cultures illuminated under
   blue (BL) LED displayed significant (p<0.05) improvements in the
   percentage of shoot organogenesis and mean number of shoot buds per
   responding explants compared to other treatments including control
   (fluorescent light, 40 W, 300-700 nm). Red LED treatment was found to be
   inhibitory on shoot organogenesis. A detrimental influence of LED light
   radiation on shoot organogenesis and concomitant changes in the levels
   of ROS and antioxidative enzyme activities were observed. Acquisition of
   organogenic competence and the initiation of shoot buds under BL-LED
   appeared to be associated with the increased level of superoxide
   dismutase activity.}},

Abstract = {{19 August 1966 Varto earthquake (Ms = 6.8; lo = IX) was sourced from
   Varto Fault Zone (VFZ) that caused 2529 deaths in the Varto region. Just
   after the occurrence of the event, some researchers have different ideas
   related to the source fault and mechanism of the earthquake. The Varto
   Fault Zone is a major NW-SE trending tectonic feature in Eastern Turkey.
   New geological mapping and description of structures have been used to
   constrain the geometry, surface deformations and geological history of
   the fault zone. According to this extensive research, the VFZ consists
   of left-lateral strike-slip faults with minor amount of reverse
   component and has been divided into three fault segments Varto,
   Leylekdag and caycati regarding as geological and morphological
   characteristics. Hence, palaeostress configurations of the segments are
   reliable with the regional similar to N-S compression direction. Lastly,
   the Varto segment northern branch of VFZ has been defined as the source
   of 19 August 1966 Varto earthquake. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Occurrence and removal of frequently prescribed pharmaceuticals and

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{532}},
Pages = {{762-770}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{The present study determines removal rates (RR) of 56 pharmaceuticals
   and metabolites, respectively, in an urban sewage treatment plant using
   mass flow analysis by comparing influent and effluent loads over a
   consecutive ten-day monitoring period. Besides well investigated
   compounds like carbamazepine and metoprolol, less researched targets,
   such as topiramate, pregabalin, telmisartan, and human metabolites of
   pharmaceuticals were included. Another aim was to determine the ratio of
   pharmaceuticals and corresponding metabolites in raw wastewater.
   Valsartan and gabapentin were detected at the highest average
   concentrations in influent (c(val) = 29.7 (+/- 8.1) mu g/L, c(gab)= 13.2
   (+/- 3.3) mu g/L) and effluent (c(val)= 22.1 (+/- 5.1) mu g/L, c(gab)=
   12.1 (+/- 2.6) mu g/L) samples. The comparison of mass loads in influent
   and effluent showed a significant removal (p < 0.1) for 20 compounds but
   only enalapril, eprosartan, losartan, pregabalin, and quetiapine were
   removed from the aqueous phase by more than 50\%. Another 20 compounds
   were determined without significant difference and for five compounds
   (clindamycin, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, O-desmethyl venlafaxine,
   triamterene), a significant higher mass load in the effluent than in the
   influent was observed.
   It has to be noticed that metabolites like 10,11-dihydro-10-hydroxy
   carbamazepine (MHD) are found in higher mass loads than the
   corresponding parent compound in the sewage samples. Furthermore,
   metabolites and parent compound behave differently in the sewage
   treatment process. While MHD (RR= 15.1\%) was detected with lower mass
   load in the effluent than in the influent, oxcarbazepine (RR=-73.2\%)
   showed the contrary pattern. When comparing expected and measured ratios
   of parent compound and metabolite in raw sewage, citalopram/N-desmethyl
   citalopram for example, showed good results. However, a major problem
   exists due to insufficient data regarding metabolism and excretion of
   many pharmaceuticals. This complicates the prediction of relevant
   metabolites and further efforts are needed to overcome this problem. (c)

Title = {{Rationale for more consistent choice of surgical approaches for
   acetabular fractures}},
Journal = {{INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{46}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: All acetabular fractures are difficult to treat surgically,
   but there are four types involving two columns that are particularly
   challenging. The choice of surgical approach is crucial. The purpose of
   the study was to determine and evaluate the factors influencing the
   choice of surgical approach for two-column acetabular fractures. We
   hypothesised that more accurate preoperative planning, sophisticated
   technical capabilities, and evolution of surgeon experience will result
   in more consistent use of nonextensile single surgical approaches. We
   also evaluated the outcomes of surgical treatment and the correlation
   with the surgical approach used.
   Design: Retrospective cohort study.
   Patients and methods: A total of 156 patients with 157 acetabular
   fractures involving two columns (Letournel T-types and both-column)
   treated surgically in a 25-year period (1988-2013) were included in the
   study. The acetabular fractures in this study were divided into two
   groups according to the date of surgery: 81 in Group 1 (1998-2002) and
   76 in Group 2 (2003-2013). All fractures were classified preoperatively
   according to the Judet and Letournel classification system and Matta's
   categorisation of surgical approach. Four surgical approaches were used:
   single Kocher-Langenbeck (KL), single ilioinguinal (II), combined
   Kocher-Langenbeck and ilioinguinal (KL + II), and extended iliofemoral
   (EIF). The efficacy of the surgical approach utilised was assessed using
   three parameters: anatomical reduction, surgical time and intraoperative
   complications.
   Results: There was no statistical difference between Group 1 and Group 2
   in the distribution of T-type (p = 0.424) and both-column (p = 0.425)
   fractures. In Group 2 more acetabular fractures were treated through
   single non-extensile approaches compared with Group 1 (90.8\% vs.
   54.3\%, p < 0.001). Increase in single approach surgery resulted in
   shorter mean surgical time (p < 0.001) and significant increase in
   anatomical reduction (p = 0.039). The frequency of intraoperative
   complications was not statistically different (p = 0.07) between the two
   groups, but there was a trend to fewer complications in Group 2.
   Conclusions: The surgical approaches chosen for acetabular fractures
   that involve two columns (Letournel T-types and both-column) should
   become more consistent. The results of this study indicate that the
   majority of such acetabular fractures can be treated successfully
   through single surgical approaches. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   An algebraic and three semi-analytical models are used here to study the

   qualitative agreement as well as reasonable quantitative agreement is
   found which allows us to validate the models for describing TJ-II radial
   electric fields. Furthermore, a simple algebraic formulation (2005
   Plasma Phys. Rep. 31 14) provides physical insight for the
   interpretation of experimental data from the TJ-II heliac in spite of
   its complicated geometry, like the place of the transition from the
   electron to the ion root of the radial electric field, which occurs at
   the maximum value of collisionality, for example.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The boundary between bipolar disorder (BD) and borderline
   personality disorder is a controversial one. Despite the importance of
   the topic, few studies have directly compared these patient groups. The
   aim of the study was to compare the executive functioning profile of BD
   and BPD patients.
   Method: Executive functioning (sustained attention, problem-solving,
   planning, strategy formation, cognitive flexibility and working memory)
   was assessed in BD (n = 30) and BPD outpatients (n = 32) using a
   computerized assessment battery (Cambridge Neuropsychological Test
   Automated Battery, CANTAB). The groups were compared to one another as
   well as to healthy controls.
   Results: BD patients showed deficits in strategy formation and in
   planning (indicated by longer execution time in the ToL task) in
   comparison to BPD patients and healthy controls. BPD patients showed
   deficits in planning (short deliberation time in the ToL task) in
   comparison to BD patients and in comparison to healthy controls. In
   comparison to healthy controls, BPD patients displayed deficits in
   problem-solving.
   Conclusions: Differences in executive dysfunction between BD and BPD
   patients suggest that this cognitive dimension may be relevant for the
   clarification of the boundary between the disorders. (C) 2015 Published

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The paper focuses on the adaptive relational association rule mining
   problem. Relational association rules represent a particular type of
   association rules which describe frequent relations that occur between
   the features characterizing the instances within a data set. We aim at
   re-mining an object set, previously mined, when the feature set
   characterizing the objects increases. An adaptive relational association
   rule method, based on the discovery of interesting relational
   association rules, is proposed. This method, called ARARM (Adaptive
   Relational Association Rule Mining) adapts the set of rules that was
   established by mining the data before the feature set changed,
   preserving the completeness. We aim to reach the result more efficiently
   than running the mining algorithm again from scratch on the
   feature-extended object set. Experiments testing the method's
   performance on several case studies are also reported. The obtained
   results highlight the efficiency of the ARARM method and confirm the
   potential of our proposal. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{With the shift from an industry-based society to a knowledge-based one,
   there has been a gradual increase in the importance of intangible assets
   such as technologies and information. Patents are a representative
   intellectual outcome of intangible assets and can be used as an
   objective measure of the level of technology or innovation of
   individuals, firms, and countries. In addition, patents can be regarded
   as a rich source of data for the provision of technological and
   commercial information. Patent data facilitate research on technological
   advances and innovation; hence, an analysis of this data can provide
   important insights into innovation activity and technology management
   strategies. This paper presents a method for extracting core
   technologies from core fuel cell vehicle (FCV) patents registered with
   the United States Patent and Trademark Office by using a data mining
   technique. Core patents are determined by analyzing patent citations,
   and the data mining technique identifies those firms with core FCV
   technologies and reveals the overall research focus of the firms by
   deriving patent portfolios and and technology recommendations
   considering the extracted core technologies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All

   ecology of a narrowly distributed Kenyan endemic bird species}},

Abstract = {{Conflicts between human needs and nature conservation are exceptionally
   pronounced along rivers in tropical Kenya, where riparian ecosystems
   create important retreats for many endangered species, but also provide
   important ecosystem services for the local human population. This
   situation has led to a landscape mosaic consisting of dense thickets and
   agricultural plots. We assessed the occurrence of the Kenyan endemic
   riparian bird species HindesA ` Babbler Turdoides hindei along three
   rivers in south-east Kenya. We analysed the landscape coverage within
   habitat circles of 220 m radius, which are occupied and unoccupied (the
   latter randomly selected along the rivers) by our targeted bird species.
   Based on these data we calculated habitat preferences and population
   structure of T. hindei. Our data reveal that its occurrence probability
   increased with coverage of thickets. Furthermore, geographic distances
   among local populations of T. hindei decreased with thicket coverage and
   vice versa. These data reveal the relevance of thicket coverage as a key
   factor for the occurrence of T. hindei, influencing its population
   structure. However, most of the thicket patches mapped along the three
   rivers are small and geographically isolated from each other. Further
   deforestation might lead to additional reduction of the population size
   and abundance of T. hindei, and may ultimately lead to local extinction
   of this, and other endangered species adapted on riparian thickets. This
   example underlines the need to extend nature conservation to areas being
   densely populated by humans-beyond prime areas of nature conservation in
   East Africa.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet provides its users with a variety of services, and these
   services include free online machine translators, which translate free
   of charge between many of the world's languages such as Arabic, English,
   Chinese, German, Spanish, French, Russian, etc. Machine translators
   facilitate the transfer of information between different languages, thus
   eliminating the language barrier, since the amount of information and
   knowledge available varies from one language to another, Arabic content
   on the internet, for example, accounts 1\% of the total internet
   content, while Arabs constitute 5\% of the population of the earth,
   which means that the intellectual productivity of the Arabs is low
   because within internet use Internet's Arabic content represents 20\% of
   their natural proportion, which in turn encouraged some Arab parties to
   improve Arabic content within the internet. So, many of those interested
   specialists rely on machine translators to bridge the knowledge gap
   between the information available in the Arabic language and those in
   other living languages such as English.
   This empirical study aims to identify the best Arabic to English Machine
   translation system, in order to help the developers of these systems to
   enhance the effectiveness of these systems. Furthermore, such studies
   help the users to choose the best. This study involves the construction
   of a system for Automatic Machine Translation Evaluation System of the
   Arabic language into language. This study includes assessing the
   accuracy of the translation by the two known machine translators, Google
   Translate, and the second, which bears the name of Babylon machine
   translation from Arabic into English. BLEU and METEOR methods are used
   the MT quality, and to identify the closer method to human judgments.
   The authors conclude that BLEU is closer to human judgments METEOR
   method.}},

Abstract = {{Acrylic artist paints are viscoelastic composites containing a high
   molecular weight copolymer, pigment and a variety of additives. The
   glass transition temperature of the latex binder is typically slightly
   below ambient conditions, giving mechanical properties that are strongly
   dependent on strain rate and temperature. In previous work, the
   viscoelastic behaviour of custom-formulated latex artist paints was
   reported for films with known volume fractions of pigment using data
   from uniaxial tensile tests at different strain rates and temperatures.
   Secant Young's modulus and failure strain master curves were constructed
   for each film through time-temperature superposition, allowing
   predictions beyond the experimental timescale at a selected reference
   temperature. A similar analysis is now presented for a small set of
   commercial artist paints tested at ages of 1 and 27 years. Experimental
   shift factor values are reported with fits to the Arrhenius, WLF and
   Vogel Fulcher equations, along with a comparison with published data for
   acrylic polymers. The tensile results highlight a spectrum of properties
   that acrylic paints may exhibit-brittle glass to hyperelastic-depending
   on the conditions during deformation. Strong similarities are shown
   between products from different manufacturers, and the findings suggest
   a high degree of stability with age. A method for predicting failure as
   a function of strain rate and temperature is also presented, and the
   methodology gives a framework for investigating other artist materials
   and the factors influencing their mechanical properties.}},

Abstract = {{{[}Purpose] This research was conducted to investigate the effects of
   modified trampoline training on the balance, gait, and falls efficacy of
   stroke patients. {[}Subjects] Twenty-four stroke patients participated
   in this study. The subjects were randomly allocated to one of two
   groups: the trampoline group (n=12) or the control group (n=12).
   {[}Methods] Both groups participated in conventional physical therapy
   for thirty minutes per day, three times a week for six weeks. The
   trampoline group also took part in trampoline training for thirty
   minutes per day, three times a week for six weeks. We evaluated balance
   (Berg balance scale, timed up and go test), gait (dynamic gait index),
   and falls efficacy (falls efficacy scale-K) to confirm the effects of
   the intervention. {[}Results] Both the trampoline and the control group
   showed significant improvements in balance, gait, and falls efficacy
   compared to before the intervention, and the improvements were
   significantly greater in the trampoline group than in the control group.
   {[}Conclusion] Modified trampoline training resulted in significantly
   improved balance, dynamic gait, and falls efficacy of stroke patients
   compared to the control group. These results suggest that modified
   trampoline training is feasible and effective at improving balance,
   dynamic gait, and falls efficacy after stroke.}},

Abstract = {{The existence of interactions between the immune and the sympathetic
   nervous systems is well established. Noradrenaline can promote or
   inhibit the immune response, and conversely, the immune response itself
   can affect noradrenaline concentration in lymphoid organs, such as the
   spleen. It is also well known that acetylcholine released by
   pre-ganglionic neurons can modulate noradrenaline release by the
   postsynaptic neuron. The spleen does not receive cholinergic
   innervation, but it has been reported that lymphocytes themselves can
   produce acetylcholine, and express acetylcholine receptors and
   acetylcholinesterase. We found that the spleen of not overtly immunized
   mice in which muscarinic type 1 acetylcholine receptors have been
   knocked out (M1KO) has higher noradrenaline concentrations than that of
   the wildtype mice, without comparable alterations in the heart, in
   parallel to a decreased number of IgG-producing B cells. Splenic
   lymphocytes from M1KO mice displayed increased in vitro-induced
   cytotoxicity, and this was observed only when CD4(+) T cells were
   present. In contrast, heterozygous acetylcholinesterase (AChE+/-) mice,
   had no alterations in splenic noradrenaline concentration, but the in
   vitro proliferation of AChE+/- CD4(+) T cells was increased. It is
   theoretically conceivable that reciprocal effects between neuronally and
   non-neuronally derived acetylcholine and noradrenaline might contribute
   to the results reported. Our results emphasize the need to consider the
   balance between the effects of these mediators for the final
   immunoregulatory outcome. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Piezoceramic materials (such as PZT) have excellent piezoelectric
   properties and have been extensively used in vibration energy
   harvesting. Conventional piezoceramic-based energy harvesters (SDOF
   systems) are only efficient near their 1st resonance, and their 2nd
   resonance is generally ignored due to the higher frequency and
   comparatively lower response level. A properly designed dynamic
   magnifier can be used in a 2-DOF system to increase the effective
   bandwidth of the device by reducing the frequency gap between the 1st
   and 2nd resonances. The output is therefore improved by increasing the
   strain produced in the piezoelectric cantilever. Nevertheless, such a
   device cannot effectively harvest energy from vibrations at a frequency
   below 30 Hz. We present a piezoceramic-based wideband low-frequency
   vibration energy harvester that exploits the mechanical impact of the
   mass of a flexible dynamic magnifier on a harvester base stopper. This
   mechanical impact delivers a large secondary force to a piezoceramic
   cantilevered secondary beam, resulting in an increased strain and also
   triggering a non-linear frequency up-conversion mechanism that increases
   both the output power and the bandwidth of the operating frequency. A
   prototype energy harvester with a mass ratio of mu=5.8 and a stopper
   distance of d=0.5 mm generated a peak power with a maximum of 449 mu W
   delivered to an optimal load of 30 k Omega at a frequency of 17 Hz, and
   the half-power bandwidth was found to be 15 Hz (from 9 Hz to 24 Hz) at 1
   g of acceleration, indicating that the device is capable of efficiently
   harvesting energy from a broad range of low-frequency random vibrations
   as well as shocks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. All

Abstract = {{There is a risk of dissemination of uterine malignancies during
   minimally invasive hysterectomies when morcellation is used. Although
   the technique of uterine power morcellation allows timely removal of

   diagnostic tools for preoperative assessment of uterine tumors, and
   summarizes the current recommendations of the Society of Gynecologic
   Oncologists, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,
   and the American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists.
   Recommendations include informed consent of the risk of disseminating an

Title = {{Thermal changes during healing of distal radius fractures-Preliminary
   findings}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The bone healing process is very complex. In simple terms,
   bone healing comprises three basic steps, the inflammation phase, the
   repair phase and the remodelling phase. The increase in blood flow
   around the fracture during the healing process increases the temperature
   of the surrounding tissue. Infrared thermography is a method of
   measuring body temperature that can detect temperature changes during
   bone healing. Studies on the application of thermography in traumatology
   are scarce, and there are no studies of thermal changes during normal
   bone healing. The authors have tried to determine the dynamics of
   thermal changes during bone healing.
   Material and methods: The Flir ThermaCam B2 (FLIR Systems, Inc., Oregon,
   USA) was used for all measurements. Thermographic recordings were made
   one, three, five, 11 and 23 weeks after fracture. The contralateral,
   healthy, forearm was used for comparison.
   Results: A total of 25 patients of mean age 65.9 +/- 10.4 years (range
   50-80 years) with fracture of the distal radius were examined in this
   study. The mean temperature difference between healthy and fractured
   distal forearm one week after fracture was 1.20 +/- 0.48 degrees C,
   three weeks after fracture was 1.42 +/- 0.54 degrees C, five weeks after
   fracture was 1.04 +/- 0.53 8C, 11 weeks after fracture was 0.50 +/- 0.30
   degrees C, and 23 weeks after fracture was 0.22 +/- 0.25 degrees C.
   Conclusion: Preliminary findings during this research showed significant
   temperature changes during healing of distal radius fractures. Infrared
   thermography is a simple and reliable method in clinical practice that
   could be used as a good follow-up method in traumatology, but further
   investigations on more patients are needed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Wide band gap semiconductors are more and more used, especially to
   design high voltage devices. However, some devices show lower breakdown
   voltages than those predicted in theory. These early breakdown are in
   general due to imperfections in the peripheral protections of the active
   junction. The aim of these protections is to reduce electric field peaks
   at the periphery of the junction. Thus, it is important to study the
   electric field distribution on the device periphery to detect any
   protection weakness. This paper presents a 2D electric field imagery
   using OBIC (optical beam induced current) technique. 2D cartographies
   are realized on JTE (junction termination extension) protected diodes in
   order to display electric field on diode peripheries. Other measurements
   are also performed on circular avalanche diodes protected with a MESA
   etching and provided with optical window. In both cases, OBIC techniques
   is demonstrated to be an efficient method to obtain electric field
   distribution within the device and to locate defects.}},

Abstract = {{Background and study aims: Severe bleeding is a potentially lethal
   complication after endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) and endoscopic
   papillary balloon dilation (EPBD) for choledocholithiasis. This study
   aimed to evaluate the impact of antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants
   on this complication.
   Patients and methods: Patients who underwent EST and EPBD were
   identified in a Japanese nationwide administrative database covering
   1090 hospitals. Adjusting for other potential risk factors, we evaluated
   the association between oral administration of antiplatelet agents
   and/or anticoagulants (continuation, discontinuation, and non-use) and
   clinically significant bleeding within 3 days of the procedure.
   Results: In total, 61002 patients were analyzed (EST, 54493 patients;
   EPBD, 6509). The rate of severe bleeding was 0.8\% in both groups, but
   EPBD was performed more frequently than EST in patients with chronic
   renal failure, liver cirrhosis, and in those receiving antiplatelet
   agents or anticoagulants. The impact of continuation/discontinuation of
   antiplatelet agents on severe bleeding was not statistically significant
   in the EST or EPBD groups. The use of anticoagulants was associated with
   a statistically significant increase in severe bleeding compared with
   non-use for EST (1.6\% 27 of 1688 patients vs. 0.8\% 429 of 52 805
   patients; adjusted odds ratio {[}OR] 1.70; 95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI] 1.10-2.63) and for EPBD (3.0\% {[}8 of 263 patients] vs. 0.7\% 46
   of 6246 patients; adjusted OR 2.91; 95\% CI 1.36-6.24).
   Conclusions: EST and EPBD can be safely performed in patients receiving
   antiplatelet agents. Users of anticoagulants are at high risk of
   bleeding, and the periprocedural management of these should be further
   investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Plant cell wall represents an important source of fermentable sugars for

   deconstruction, as their enzymes present unique features compatible with
   current industrial process conditions. The present study was carried out
   to evaluate the use of different agro-industrial wastes as suitable
   carbon sources for growth and enzyme secretion by a strain of
   Clostridium thermocellum isolated from goat rumen. C thermocellum BS was
   able to grow on/degrade microcrystalline cellulose, Sugar cane
   bagasse/Straw and Cotton waste, and produced different sets of
   cellulases and hemicellulases in their presence. The enzymatic mixtures
   produced by C. thermocellum (BS) showed activities over a broad range of
   temperatures (50-70 degrees C). Highest values were obtained between 60
   and 70 degrees C, at a pH range from 5 to 7, decreasing at alkaline pH
   values. In addition, enzymes displayed thermostability, with CMCase and
   xylanase activities maintaining maximum values over 12 days at 50

Abstract = {{Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a medical emergency that can be life
   threatening or lead to severe disability even if recognized and managed
   early. Majority of spontaneous SAHs arise from a ruptured saccular
   aneurysm. However, up to 15\% of SAHs do not have a bleeding source and
   are termed nonaneurysmal SAHs. Although sudden, severe headache is
   classically associated with aneurysmal SAHs, nonaneurysmal SAHs tend to
   have a more gradual onset headache and can even present with transient
   amnesia in about one-third of patients. Here, we report a case of
   prolonged transientamnesia secondary to SAH with acute hydrocephalus in
   a postpartum 38-year-old woman with a history of essential
   thrombocytosis on aspirin.}},

Abstract = {{New generations of hydrophobic composite geomaterials intended to sorb
   certain hazardous wastes are assembled by mixing surfactant-modified
   aluminum-pillared montmorillonite (Al-SMPM) with activated carbon (AC).
   The sorption of 4-nitrophenol (4NP) and 2-nitrophenol (2NP) on these
   sorbents was studied in both single and binary component systems from
   aqueous solutions using batch tests. Results showed the efficiency of
   these composite sorbents relative to the two phenolic compounds, with a
   dominant contribution from Al-SMPM. In single-component systems,
   sorption isotherms of 4NP and 2NP as a function of pH were analyzed with
   the Freundlich equation, whose statistical interpretation was also
   developed. Sorption capacities sharply decreased when the solution pH
   value was raised from 3 to 9. In binary-component systems, the fit
   between measured and predicted simultaneous sorption capacities of both
   4NP and 2NP indicated that the Sheindorf-Rebhun-Sheintuch model, an
   extended Freundlich model, is fully applicable. The 2NP favorably
   influences the sorption of 4NP. The synergistic effect between these two
   nitrophenol compounds has been confirmed by the higher competition
   coefficients, which increase with increasing pH. A number of hypotheses,
   based on the Abraham's salvation parameters model, have been advanced to
   discuss this mechanism. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The irrigation sector constitutes the backbone of Uzbekistan's economy,
   providing social and economic stability in the region. The sector
   collapsed with the fall of the Soviet Union, due to worsening of
   infrastructure conditions causing tensions among resource users.
   Subsequent irrigation management reforms were implemented in a top-down
   manner. More than a decade after the initial reforms - which established
   local Water Consumers Association (WCA) and transferred operation and
   maintenance responsibilities for on-farm irrigation canals - the poor
   performance of these associations is still apparent, illustrating the
   heritage of the strong role of state agencies in Uzbek water management
   that still affects collective irrigation management today. This paper
   identifies the necessary and sufficient conditions for successfully
   managing common pool resources (CPRs) and, more specifically, irrigation
   canal maintenance in the rural Bukhara region of Uzbekistan. Fifteen
   WCAs were examined regarding conditions that may facilitate successful
   irrigation canal maintenance. Methods involved focus group discussions
   and in-depth interviews with the associations concerned. Data gathered
   was analyzed using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. The
   results indicate that two paths of local factors can lead to
   well-maintained irrigation canals: (1) the combination of appropriate
   chairmanship skills with sustainable resource appropriation or (2) the
   combination of appropriate chairmanship skills with the presence of
   effective participatory governance. The results also illustrate the role
   of path-dependence and traditional co-production of irrigation
   management in Uzbekistan. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Elucidating the growth responses of roots to water status will reveal
   physiological mechanisms underlying drought tolerance and water
   conservation in plants. Hydroponic experiments were conducted using two
   winter wheat cultivars, Wangshuibai (drought-sensitive) and Luohan 7
   (drought-tolerant), and a water deficit was induced using a 20 \% (m/v)
   aqueous solution of polyethylene glycol 6000 (-0.6 MPa). The lack of
   water significantly reduced the plant dry weight, leaf area, total root
   length (TRL) and surface area in seminal (SRs) and nodal roots (NRs),
   but the effects were less pronounced in Luohan 7 than in Wangshuibai.
   After re-watering, leaf area, TRL and surface area of Luohan 7 increased
   significantly, as compared to the controls, due to rapid compensatory
   growth of SRs, while those of Wangshuibai were still significantly
   reduced. Under water-deficit conditions, the concentrations of
   indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and cytokinin (CTK) and their ratio (IAA/CTK)
   in SRs and NRs of both cultivars were significantly lower than those of
   controls, but increased after re-watering. However, Luohan 7 showed
   significantly increases in IAA/CTK of SRs as compared to the control.
   Net photosynthetic rate was much lower during water deficit in both
   cultivars, but it was enhanced significantly after re-watering,
   especially for Luohan 7. Moreover, sucrose content was significantly
   increased in leaves while reduced in roots under water-deficit
   conditions. After re-watering, sucrose content in leaves of both
   cultivars and in roots of Wangshuibai was severely reduced, while the
   values in roots of Luohan 7 were significantly increased as compared to
   the control. These results indicate that the drought-tolerant cultivar
   has a greater ability to maintain plant growth under water deficit and
   greater compensatory growth in SRs associated with higher IAA/CTK and
   photosynthetic products supply after re-watering.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, ground columns, such as vibro-concrete columns and
   geosynthetic-reinforced stone columns, have been increasingly used to
   support superstructures and embankments when they are constructed on
   soft foundations. Several new column technologies have emerged,
   including different shapes of concrete columns and composite columns.
   The column technologies have also been combined with other technologies
   to create more effective and/or economic solutions. However, the
   composite columns and the combined technologies have presented
   complicated geotechnical problems in design and construction. This paper
   summarises different types of column technologies and their functions,
   installation and applications, addresses design issues, and reviews
   recent research and development related to the column technologies to
   improve soft foundations, including failure modes, load transfer
   mechanisms, bearing capacity, settlement, consolidation and stability.
   Recent research has indicated that lateral deformation and yielding of
   columns should be considered in a unit cell model for the analyses of
   load transfer, deformation and consolidation. Several theoretical
   solutions have been proposed for the rate of consolidation of
   column-reinforced soft foundations. Different failure modes should be
   evaluated for the stability of column-supported embankments. Limit
   equilibrium methods based on shear failure overestimate the factors of
   safety of embankments on rigid or semi-rigid columns in soft soil.}},

Abstract = {{Vasopressin secretion from the posterior pituitary gland is determined
   by action potential discharge of hypothalamic magnocellular
   neurosecretory cells. Vasopressin is a potent vasoconstrictor, but
   vasopressin levels are paradoxically elevated in some patients with
   established hypertension. To determine whether vasopressin neurons are
   excited in hypertension, extracellular single-unit recordings of
   vasopressin neurons from urethane-anaesthetized Cyp1a1-Ren2 rats with
   inducible angiotensin-dependent hypertension were made. The basal firing
   rate of vasopressin neurons was higher in hypertensive Cyp1a1-Ren2 rats
   than in non-hypertensive Cyp1a1-Ren2 rats. The increase in firing rate
   was specific to vasopressin neurons because oxytocin neuron firing
   ratewas unaffected by the induction of hypertension. Intravenous
   injection of the (1)-adrenoreceptor agonist, phenylephrine (2.5g/kg),
   transiently increased mean arterial blood pressure to cause a
   baroreflex-induced inhibition of heart rate and vasopressin neuron
   firing rate (by 52 +/- 9\%) in non-hypertensive rats. By contrast,
   intravenous phenylephrine did not inhibit vasopressin neurons in
   hypertensive rats, despite a similar increase in mean arterial blood
   pressure and inhibition of heart rate. Circulating angiotensin II can
   excite vasopressin neurons via activation of afferent inputs from the
   subfornical organ. However, the increase in vasopressin neuron firing
   rate and the loss of inhibition by intravenous phenylephrine were not
   blocked by intra-subfornical organ infusion of the angiotensin AT1
   receptor antagonist, losartan. It can be concluded that increased
   vasopressin neuron activity at the onset of hypertension is driven, at
   least in part, by reduced baroreflex inhibition of vasopressin neurons
   and that this might exacerbate the increase in blood pressure at the
   onset of hypertension.}},

Abstract = {{Two cold rolled hot-dip galvanizing dual phase (DP) 450 steels with
   different amounts of chromium were designed and the effects of the
   chromium concentration and galvanizing processes on the microstructure
   and mechanical properties were also investigated. The results show that
   the experimental steels exhibit typical dual phase microstructure
   character. However, the ferrite phase of steel with higher chromium is
   more regular and its boundaries are clearer. Meanwhile, martensite
   austenite (MA) island in steel No. 2 is diffused and no longer
   distributes along the grain boundary as net or chain shape. More MA
   islands enriched with Cr element can be found in the ferrite grains, and
   the increment of Cr element improves the stablity of the austenite so
   that the austenite has been reserved in MA islands. In addition, the
   experimental steel with higher chromium exhibits better elongation,
   lower yield ratio and better formability. The mean hole expanding ratio
   of steels No. 1 and No. 2 is 161.70\% and 192.70\%, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Cannabinoids produce analgesia in several pain models, but
   the undesirable side effects from high doses of cannabinoid drugs limit
   their clinic use. Our recent results indicate that cannabinoid-induced
   antinociception was enhanced by neuropeptide VF (NPVF). Here, we
   investigate whether low-dose cannabinoid agonists combined with NPVF can
   produce effective antinociception with limited side effects.
   METHODS: The in vivo properties of
   (R)-(-1)-{[}2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-(4-morpholinylmethyl)pyrrolo{[}1,2,3-
   de]-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl]-1-napthalenylmethanone (WIN55,212-2) given
   alone and its combination with NPVF were evaluated in nociceptive
   modulation, locomotor activity, gastrointestinal transit, and tolerance
   development assays after intracerebroventricular administration in mice.
   RESULTS: In the radiant tail-flick test, the antinociception of
   combination of WIN55,212-2 and NPVF was more potent than that of
   cannabinoid agonist given alone, with an ED50 shift from 3.51 to 0.69
   nmol; 9 nmol WIN55,212-2 alone and 3 nmol WIN55,212-2 combined with NPVF
   induced equivalent antinociception after supraspinal administration. The
   cannabinoid-potentiating effects of NPVF were reduced by both the
   cannabinoid receptor type 1 and the neuropeptide FF receptor
   antagonists. In the formalin assay, WIN55,212-2 combined with NPVF also
   significantly reduced pain-related behaviors. However, the combination
   of WIN55,212-2 with NPVF exerted significant hypoactivity in a manner
   similar to high doses of WIN55,212-2. It was important to note that the
   combination of WIN55,212-2 with NPVF produced nontolerance-forming
   antinociception and weaker inhibition of gastrointestinal transit
   compared with high dose of WIN55,212-2.
   CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the cannabinoid agonist combined
   with NPVF produces effective antinociception-lacking tolerance via both
   cannabinoid receptor type 1 and neuropeptide FF receptors in the brain.}},

Abstract = {{The Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni, Norman) is a large
   notothenioid fish that supports valuable fisheries around the Antarctic
   continent. The Ross Sea fishery, which started in 1997, is managed by
   the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources
   (CCAMLR). Whilst a large amount of research into the biology of this
   species has been carried out over the past decade, much of this work has
   been presented in CCAMLR working group papers and has not been published
   in the primary literature. In this paper, we bring together and
   summarise the extensive published and unpublished literature on the
   biology and ecology of Antarctic toothfish in the Ross Sea region
   including distribution, stock structure, reproduction, age and growth,
   and trophic ecology in a single document for the first time. We also
   review and further develop testable hypotheses surrounding its life
   cycle and identify gaps in our knowledge including spawning behaviour
   and early life history which need to be addressed.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction of organic compounds with clay minerals can change the
   size of crystals. However, in soils this effect is still unclear because
   of limitations in separation of pure mineral phases for conducting
   dissolution experiments. In this study, the relationship between soil
   organic matter (SOM) and mean crystallite size (MCS) of clay minerals
   from surface and subsurface horizons of soils from a toposequence in
   Southern Brazil was evaluated. Soil C and N contents were determined and
   the nature of the SOM functional groups were evaluated by FTIR
   spectroscopy. The MCS of minerals was assessed by X ray diffraction
   performed on Fe-oxide free samples and on Fe-concentrated samples. The C
   and N content and the relative intensities of the FTIR spectra were
   considered as predictor variables, and the MCS of hematite, goethite,
   kaolinite, and gibbsite as predicated variables. The C and N content and
   carboxylic and C-O-alkyl groups showed significant effects on the
   variation of MCS. The crystallite dimension of the Fe-oxides and
   kaolinite was inversely affected by these SOM properties. In contrast,
   the MCS of gibbsite was not affected by the SOM properties. The SOM
   influence on the MCS of Fe-oxides was attributed to surface complexation
   reactions and to surface redox reactions that promote a continuous
   dissolution-precipitation process.}},

Volume = {{194}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objective: It is well documented that an imbalance in immune tolerance
   at the maternal-fetal interface is likely to play an essential role in
   the etiology of preeclampsia. However, the mechanisms underlying immune
   tolerance during preeclampsia are still poorly understood. Tim-3, a
   Th1-specific cell surface molecule, is a relatively newly described
   molecule with important immunological functions. It can regulate Th1
   responses with its ligand galectin-9 (Gal-9), and has become an
   attractive candidate for exploring the pathogenesis of preeclampsia.
   Study design: Twenty normal pregnancies and 20 preeclamptic pregnancies
   were enrolled in the present study. We examined the expression and
   function of Tim-3/Gal-9 in decidual tissue at the RNA and protein
   levels. In order to analyze their correlation with the development of
   preeclampsia, we measured the expression of Tim-3 on peripheral blood
   leukocytes using flow cytometry. IFN-gamma, IL-10, and IL-17 in the
   peripheral blood plasma were measured by ELISA.
   Results: Tim-3/Gal-9 was upregulated in decidual tissue of preeclamptic
   vs. normotensive pregnancies. There was a significantly increased Th1
   and Th17 response in PE as demonstrated by the upregulated levels of
   IFN-gamma/IL-17, whereas IL-10 secreted by Th2 cells was sharply
   reduced.
   Conclusions: The present study showed that an abnormal Tim-3/Gal-9
   pathway was able to facilitate the development of preeclampsia. Our data
   uncovered a novel mechanism by which the Tim-3/Gal-9 pathway regulates
   immune responses, and we now identify this pathway as a potential
   therapeutic target in preeclampsia. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In the current study, we developed a stable isotope labeling strategy
   for the absolute quantification of gibberellins (GAs) by high
   performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry
   (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS). N,N-dimethyl ethylenediamine (DMED) and its deuterated
   counterpart d(4)-DMED were used to derivatize GAs extracted from plant
   tissue samples and GA standards respectively. The both derivatives of
   GAs were mixed and then subjected to HPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. The
   absolute quantification of GAs in plant tissues could be achieved by
   calculating the peak area ratios of DMED labeled GAs/d(4)-DMED labeled
   GAs. In the proposed strategy, the derivatization reaction of the
   labeling reagents with GAs could be completed rapidly (within 5 min)
   with high efficiency ( > 99\%) under mild conditions. The resulting
   derivatives could produce specific fragments in collision induced
   dissociation (CID), leading to high selectivity in multiple-reaction
   monitoring (MRM) mode, thus enhanced the reliability of the LC-MS/MS
   method. Furthermore, the limits of quantitation (LOQs) of GAs were
   considerably decreased (2-32 folds) due to incorporating easily ionized
   moieties into GAs, and the quantification of GAs in plant tissue could
   be achieved without isotopically labeled GA standards. Good linearity
   was obtained with correlation coefficients R-2 values of >0.99. The
   limits of detection (LODs) and quantitation (LOQs) ranged from 0.02 to

   dimerization}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Mitotic spindle assembly requires the regulated activities of protein
   kinases such as Nek7 and Nek9. Nek7 is autoinhibited by the protrusion
   of Tyr97 into the active site and activated by the Nek9 non-catalytic
   C-terminal domain (CTD). CTD binding apparently releases autoinhibition
   because mutation of Tyr97 to phenylalanine increases Nek7 activity
   independently of Nek9. Here we find that self-association of the
   Nek9-CTD is needed for Nek7 activation. We map the minimal Nek7 binding
   region of Nek9 to residues 810-828. A crystal structure of Nek7(Y97F)
   bound to Nek9(810-828) reveals a binding site on the C-lobe of the Nek7
   kinase domain. Nek7(Y97F) crystallizes as a back-to-back dimer between
   kinase domain N-lobes, in which the specific contacts within the
   interface are coupled to the conformation of residue 97. Hence, we
   propose that the Nek9-CTD activates Nek7 through promoting back-to-back
   dimerization that releases the autoinhibitory tyrosine residue, a
   mechanism conserved in unrelated kinase families.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines whether a Salvadoran alternative newspaper
   maintained its critical, independent, and alternative position after the
   country's first leftist president was elected and the newspaper no
   longer was in opposition to the government. Via a content analysis and
   in-depth interviews that drove the content analysis, this study improves
   our understanding of alternativeness' in a non-US context. Using a
   theoretical lens founded on alternative media scholarship and
   sociology's displacement theory to examine the newspaper's radical
   purpose, the study found that once the left came into power after
   decades of rightist and authoritarian rule, the newspaper's alternative
   mission and goals were displaced, becoming less radical and more
   propagandistic. Pro-government coverage increased and coverage of social
   movements, civil society, and other traditionally alternative' topics
   decreased. Journalists at the newspaper acknowledged the shift in goals
   and lessening of radical purpose, but clung to the newspaper's
   alternativeness'.}},

Abstract = {{Virus populations, mixtures of viral strains or species, are a common
   feature of viral infection, and influence many viral processes including
   infection, transmission, and the induction of disease. Yet, little is
   known of the rules that define the composition and structure of these
   populations. In this study, we used three distinct strains of Citrus
   tristeza virus (CTV) to examine the effect of inoculum composition,
   titer, and order, on the virus population. We found that CTV populations
   stabilized at the same equilibrium irrespective of how that population
   was introduced into a host. In addition, both field and experimental
   observations showed that these equilibria were relatively uniform
   between individual hosts of the same species and under the same
   conditions. We observed that the structure of the equilibria reached is
   determined primarily by the host, with the same inoculum reaching
   different equilibria in different species, and by the fitness of
   individual virus variants. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Context: There is lack of information related to quadriceps and
   hamstring strength recovery during the early period of rehabilitation
   after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) using
   hamstring-tendon graft (HTG). Objective: To investigate quadriceps and
   hamstring isometric strength at 4-, 8-, and 12-wk time points after ACLR
   and to document the strength changes of these muscles over time. Design:
   Longitudinal study. Participants: 24 patients (age 28.1 +/- 8.1 y) who
   underwent unilateral single-bundle anatomic ACLR with 4-strand
   semitendinosus and gracilis tendon graft. Main Outcome Measures: The
   isometric strength of quadriceps and hamstring muscles was measured on
   an isokinetic dynamometer at a 60 degrees knee-flexion angle 4, 8, and
   12 wk after surgery. Results: Quadriceps and hamstring strength
   significantly increased over time for both the involved limb (quadriceps
   F-2,F-46 = 58.3, P < .001; hamstring F-2,F-46 = 35.7, P < .001) and
   uninvolved limb (quadriceps F-2,F-46 = 17.9, P < .001; hamstring
   F-2,F-46 = 56.9, P = .001). Quadriceps and hamstring indexes
   significantly changed from 4 wk (QI 57.9, HI 54.4) to 8 wk (QI 78.8, HI
   69.9) and from 8 wk to 12 wk (QI 82, HI 75.7) (P < .001); however, there
   was no difference between indexes at the 12-wk time point (P = .17).
   Conclusions: The results of this study serve as a reference for
   clinicians while directing a rehabilitation protocol for HTG ACLR
   patients to better appreciate expected strength changes of the muscles
   in the early phase of recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a -herpesvirus that is linked to the
   development of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in
   solid organ recipients. We previously demonstrated that EBV+ B cell
   lymphoma cell lines isolated from patients with PTLD produce human IL-10
   as an autocrine growth factor. However, little is known regarding IL-10
   regulation in B cells. Here we show that EBV infection markedly alters
   the expression of host B cell microRNA, a class of small noncoding RNA
   that is an important regulator of transcriptional and
   posttranscriptional gene expression. Gene arrays reveal unique microRNA
   profiles in EBV+ B cell lymphoma lines from patients with PTLD, compared
   to normal B cells or in vitro generated EBV+ lymphoblastoid cell lines.
   We show that microRNA-194 expression is uniquely suppressed in EBV+ B
   cell lines from PTLD patients and that the 3'untranslated region of
   IL-10 is targeted by microRNA-194. Overexpression of microRNA-194
   attenuates IL-10 production and increases apoptosis of EBV+ B cell
   lymphoma lines. Together, these data indicate that EBV co-opts the host
   B cell microRNA network and specifically suppresses microRNA-194 to
   override control of IL-10 expression. Thus, modulation of microRNA-194
   may constitute a novel approach to inhibiting proliferation of EBV+ B
   cell lymphomas in PTLD.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the application of a static Var compensator (SVC)
   to improve the damping of interarea oscillations. Optimal location and
   size of SVC are defined using bifurcation and modal analysis to satisfy
   its primary application. Furthermore, the best-input signal for damping
   controller is selected using Hankel singular values and right half
   plane-zeros. The proposed approach is aimed to design a robust PI
   controller based on interval plants and Kharitonov's theorem. The
   objective here is to determine the stability region to attain robust
   stability, the desired phase margin, gain margin, and bandwidth. The
   intersection of the resulting stability regions yields the set of
   k(p)-k(i) parameters. In addition, optimal multiobjective design of PI
   controller using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is
   presented. The effectiveness of the suggested controllers in damping of
   local and interarea oscillation modes of a multimachine power system,
   over a wide range of loading conditions and system configurations, is
   confirmed through eigenvalue analysis and nonlinear time domain
   simulation. (C) 2015 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Hypertension is the persisted elevation of blood pressure above the
   normal rates. About 40\% of adults in glob suffered from hypertension
   which Estimated to cause about 12.8\% of total annual deaths. This high
   mortality can be explained because of its major role in the development
   of cerebrovascular and coronary heart diseases. All hypertensive cases,
   that do not have an explained etiology are called essential hypertension
   (EH), this consists about 95\% of the total diagnosed hypertension
   cases. otherwise, it is called secondary hypertension. The recent
   studies implicate many genes to have an effect on the development and
   the susceptibility of essential hypertension. genes variants such as;
   rs653178 of Ataxin-2 (ATX2N) gene and rs1530440 of chromosome 10 open
   reading frame 107 (C10orf107) gene, represent the top hit variants that
   found to be significantly associated with essential hypertension in
   several populations. We aimed by this project, to conduct a case-control
   association study to evaluate the association of rs653178 and rs1530440
   genetic variants with essential hypertension, in one of Iraqi provinces
   (Babylon) by enrolling individuals from Arab ancestry. The study
   enrolled 100 unrelated cases of well diagnosed essential hypertensive
   patients and a 70 unrelated controls of carefully selected normotensive
   individuals. For genotyping; we designed and optimized a polymerase
   chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP)
   method with the presence of internal splicing sites. Concerning ATX2N
   rs653178, there was no significant allelic or genotypic association
   achieved, both patients and control groups did not deviate from
   Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium distribution, furthermore, the same results
   were achieved when the samples segregated into male and females.
   Concerning C10orf107 rs1530440, there was no significant allelic
   association achieved, but there was a significant difference in the
   distribution of TT genotype between patient and control groups (p =
   0.032), the T allele represent a protective recessive allele which when
   present as homozygote (TT) it will confer a resistant to the carrier
   individual, all TT genotype carriers individual (N= 4) were
   normotensive. Furthermore, There were no significance association
   recorded when the samples segregated into males and females, and both
   patients and control groups did not deviated from Hardy-Weinberg
   equilibrium distribution in all studied groups. We conclude that
   C10orf107 genes variants represent a genetic factors which can modulate
   the essential hypertension susceptibility in Arab population of Babylon
   province.}},

Title = {{Correction Factors for Photocell Sprint Timing With Flying Start}},

Volume = {{10}},

Pages = {{1055-1057}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: A review of published studies monitoring sprint performance
   reveals considerable variation in start distance behind the initial
   timing gate. The aim of the current study was to generate correction
   factors across varying flying-start distances used in sprint testing
   with photocells. Methods: Forty-four well-trained junior soccer players
   (age 18.2 +/- 1.0 y, height 175 +/- 8 cm, body mass 68.4 +/- 8.9 kg)
   performed sprint testing on an indoor sprint track. They were allocated
   to 3 groups based on sprint-performance level. Times for 10- and 200-m
   sprint with foot placement ranging from 0.5 to 15 m back from the
   initial timing gate were recorded twice for each athlete. Results:
   Correction-factor equation coefficients were generated for each of the 3
   analyzed groups derived from the phase-decay equation y = (y(0) - PL) x
   exp(-k x x) + PL, where y = time difference (0.5-m flying start as
   reference), x = flying-start distance, y(0) is the y value when time is
   zero, PL (plateau) is the y value at infinite times, and k is the rate
   constant, expressed in reciprocal of the x-axis time units; if x is in
   seconds, then k is expressed in inverse seconds. R-2 was >= 998 across
   all athlete groups and sprint distances, demonstrating excellent
   goodness of fit. Within-group time differences were significant (P <
   .05) across all flying-start distance checkpoints for all groups.
   Between-groups time-saving differences up to 0.04 s were observed
   between the fastest and the slowest groups (P < .05). Conclusions: Small
   changes in flying-start distances can cause time differences larger than
   the typical gains made from specific training, or even the difference
   between the fastest and slowest elite team-sport athletes. The presented
   correction factors should facilitate more meaningful comparisons of
   published sprint-performance results.}},

Abstract = {{Transcriptomics is often used to investigate changes in an organism's
   genetic response to environmental contamination. Data noise can mask the
   effects of contaminants making it difficult to detect responding genes.
   Because the number of genes which are found differentially expressed in
   transcriptome data is often very large, algorithms are needed to reduce
   the number down to a few robust discriminative genes. We present an
   algorithm for aggregated analysis of transcriptome data which uses
   multiple fold-change thresholds (threshold screening) and p values from
   Bayesian generalized linear model in order to assess the robustness of a
   gene as a potential indicator for the treatments tested. The algorithm
   provides a robustness indicator (ROBI) as well as a significance
   profile, which can be used to assess the statistical significance of a
   given gene for different fold-change thresholds. Using ROBI, eight
   discriminative genes were identified from an exemplary dataset (Danio
   rerio FET treated with chlorpyrifos, methylmercury, and PCB) which could
   be potential indicators for a given substance. Significance profiles
   uncovered genetic effects and revealed appropriate fold-change
   thresholds for single genes or gene clusters. Fold-change threshold
   screening is a powerful tool for dimensionality reduction and feature
   selection in transcriptome data, as it effectively reduces the number of
   detected genes suitable for environmental monitoring. In addition, it is
   able to unmask patterns in altered genetic expression hidden by data
   noise and reduces the chance of type II errors, e.g., in environmental
   screening.}},

Abstract = {{New Caledonia is a global biodiversity hotspot and an epicentre for
   Gondwanan conifers, many of which are threatened by mining and by
   altered fire regimes. We studied the distribution, abundance and
   demography of the endangered Callitris sulcata. The largest populations
   are restricted to one river system in the south-east of the island, with
   satellite populations in adjoining rivers. The local distribution is
   controlled by the fire protection afforded by terrain features such as
   scree slopes, creeklines and small cliffs. Adult trees, which have
   comparatively thick bark, are able to tolerate and recover from
   infrequent surface fires, but severe fires kill trees and the seeds they
   store, a pattern similar to that in many Australian Callitris species.
   Radiocarbon dating revealed the species is slower growing than
   Australian Callitris species, possibly due to the extreme infertility of
   the ultramafic soils. The species is of high cultural value to the
   indigenous population who also prizes the durable and aromatic timber,
   and harvests have been traditionally regulated. Illegal cutting of trees
   has become a problem, but uncontrolled fires, which have caused
   substantial population declines, dwarf this threat. Given these threats,
   conservation of the species hinges on ensuring some populations remain
   remote and rarely visited by humans. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In geophysical inversion, inferences of Earth's properties from sparse
   data involve a trade-off between model complexity and the spatial
   resolving power. A recent Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC) technique
   formalized by Green, the so-called trans-dimensional samplers, allows us
   to sample between these trade-offs and to parsimoniously arbitrate
   between the varying complexity of candidate models. Here we present a
   novel framework using transdimensional sampling over tree structures.
   This new class of McMC sampler can be applied to 1-D, 2-D and 3-D
   Cartesian and spherical geometries. In addition, the basis functions
   used by the algorithm are flexible and can include more advanced
   parametrizations such as wavelets, both in Cartesian and Spherical
   geometries, to permit Bayesian multiscale analysis. This new framework
   offers greater flexibility, performance and efficiency for geophysical
   imaging problems than previous sampling algorithms. Thereby increasing
   the range of applications and in particular allowing extension to
   trans-dimensional imaging in 3-D. Examples are presented of its
   application to 2-D seismic and 3-D teleseismic tomography including
   estimation of uncertainty.}},

Title = {{Laminar burning velocity and Markstein length of ammonia/air premixed
   flames at various pressures}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},

Abstract = {{Ammonia is expected to be useful not only as a hydrogen-energy carrier
   but also as a carbon-free fuel. In order to design an ammonia fueled
   combustor, fundamental flame characteristics of ammonia must be
   understood. However, knowledge of the characteristics of ammonia/air
   flames, especially at the high pressures, has been insufficient. In this
   study, the unstretched laminar burning velocity and the Markstein length
   of ammonia/air premixed flames at various pressures up to 0.5 MPa were
   experimentally clarified for the first time. Spherically propagating
   premixed flames, which propagate in a constant volume combustion
   chamber, were observed using high-speed schlieren photography. Results
   indicate that the maximum value of unstretched laminar burning
   velocities is less than 7 cm/s within the examined conditions and is
   lower than those of hydrocarbon flames. The unstretched laminar burning
   velocity decreases with the increase in the initial mixture pressure,
   tendency being the same as that of hydrocarbon flames. The burned gas
   Markstein length increases with the increase in the equivalence ratio,
   the tendency being the same as that of hydrogen/air flames and
   methane/air flames. The burned gas Markstein lengths at 0.1 MPa are
   higher than those at 0.3 MPa and 0.5 MPa. However, the values of burned
   gas Markstein length at 0.3 MPa and 0.5 MPa are almost the same. In
   addition, numerical simulations using CHEMKIN-PRO with five detailed
   reaction mechanisms which are presently applicable for the ammonia/ air
   combustion were also conducted. However, qualitative predictions of
   unstretched laminar burning velocity using those reaction mechanisms are
   inaccurate. Thus, further improvements of reaction mechanisms are
   essential for application of ammonia/air premixed flames. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A ``Shikake{''} is an embodied trigger for the person to lead a
   behavioral change. We can say methods of creation are combinations of
   Shikakes, designed to encourage participants to find issues and create
   solutions. Innovators market game is a method for creating new ideas by
   combining existent ideas. We propose a new method for creating ideas,
   Role-based Innovators Market Game. In the game, players take part in the
   role selected from the real world, e.g., journalists, government, and
   doctors. Players create ideas based on their own roles through
   communications with other players. The rules, acting roles, and
   communication make players more creative and imaginative. Players can
   discover and solve practical problems, and improve their creative and
   imaginative skills through this activity. The result suggests that
   combining low relative information may be high evaluated in the
   situation of creating ideas. The low relative information is calculated
   by the algorithm Relativeness. In this study, we design Role-based
   Innovators Market Game and show the functions and the relations of
   factors worked as Shikake, and propose the evaluation method of ideas,

Abstract = {{The purpose of the study was to prepare and characterize curcumin (Cur)
   solid lipid nanoparticles (CurSLN) with a high-loading capacity and
   chemical stability for the treatment of oral mucosal infection. CurSLN
   were formulated using different lipids, namely, Gelucire 39/01, Gelucire
   50/13, Precirol, Compritol, and poloxamer 407 as a surfactant. Formulae
   were evaluated for their entrapment efficiency, particle size, and ex
   vivo mucoadhesion test. Microbiological evaluation was carried out on
   six microorganisms, five of which are the most commonly affecting oral
   cavity in terms of determination of minimum inhibitory concentration
   (MIC), and minimum bactericidal concentration. Transmission electron
   microscopy was conducted for ultrathin section for Candida
   albicans-treated with formulated Cur. The results showed high entrapment
   efficiency and stability enhancement for Cur powder. Significant amount
   of Cur was retained onto the mucosal tissue indicating preferential
   mucosal uptake. CurSLN showed higher antimicrobial activity as compared
   with Cur raw material and chemically stabilized Cur where it showed MIC
   (0.185, 0.09375, 0.75, 3, 1.5, and 0.1875 mg/mL) against Staphylococcus
   aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Viridansstrept, Escherichia coli,
   Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Candida albicans, respectively. The
   prepared lipid nanoparticles maintained Cur chemical stability and
   microbiological activity. The lack of local antimicrobial therapeutics
   with minimum side effects augments the importance of studying natural
   products for this purpose. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the

   diversification of a fruit tree crop}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Date palms (Phoenix dactylifera) are the most significant perennial crop
   in arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. Here, we present a
   comprehensive catalogue of approximately seven million single nucleotide
   polymorphisms in date palms based on whole genome re-sequencing of a
   collection of 62 cultivars. Population structure analysis indicates a
   major genetic divide between North Africa and the Middle East/South
   Asian date palms, with evidence of admixture in cultivars from Egypt and
   Sudan. Genome-wide scans for selection suggest at least 56 genomic
   regions associated with selective sweeps that may underlie geographic
   adaptation. We report candidate mutations for trait variation, including
   nonsense polymorphisms and presence/absence variation in gene content in
   pathways for key agronomic traits. We also identify a copia-like
   retrotransposon insertion polymorphism in the R2R3 myb-like orthologue
   of the oil palm virescens gene associated with fruit colour variation.
   This analysis documents patterns of post-domestication diversification
   and provides a genomic resource for this economically important
   perennial tree crop.}},

Abstract = {{YAG:Ce glass-ceramic was fabricated by combustion synthesis under high
   gravity. The phase composition, microstructure and photoluminescence
   properties of the prepared YAG:Ce glass-ceramic were determined by X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), micro-Raman
   spectrometer (Raman) and spectrophotometer, respectively. It is found
   that the metallic and ceramic products of the combustion reaction are
   separated from each other, and high purity YAG glass-ceramic is obtained
   with the application of high gravity field. Morphology of YAG crystals
   changes gradually from dendritic to polygonal, and finally to columnar
   shape along high gravity direction. The Raman spectra and compositions
   of residual glasses were analyzed along high gravity direction. The
   formation of graded microstructure in YAG glass-ceramic may be caused by
   the compositional sedimentation and thermal diffusion along high gravity
   direction. The density and hardness of the polygons layer are 4.0 g
   cm(-3) and 9.0 GPa, respectively. The photoluminescence spectrum of
   YAG:Ce glass-ceramic suggests that it can be considered as a candidate

Abstract = {{Human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) is a well-known amyloid protein
   that is associated with type II diabetes. Inhibitors of this peptide
   include aromatic organic molecules, short peptides, and metal complexes,
   such as zinc, ruthenium and vanadium compounds. Various metal ions and
   their complexes affect the fibrillization of hIAPP in different action
   modes. However, the assembly mechanism of the peptide remains unclear.
   This study evaluated the inhibitory effects of three gold complexes with
   different nitrogen-containing aromatic ligands, namely,
   {[}Au(bipy)Cl-2]{[}PF6] (1), {[}Au(Ph(2)bpy)Cl-2]Cl (2), and
   {[}Au(phen)Cl-2]Cl (3), on the amyloid fibrillization of hIAPP. The
   complexes interacted with the peptide mainly through hydrophobic
   interaction and metal coordination. The concentration dependence of
   hIAPP aggregation on gold complex indicated that the assembly behavior
   of hIAPP is significantly affected by these compounds. The gold
   complexes inhibited peptide aggregation through dimerization and
   stabilized the peptide to monomers. Gold ion was found to be a key
   influencing factor of the binding mode and assembly behavior of hIAPP.
   The different effects of the complexes on peptide aggregation might be
   attributed to their special ligands. This study provided insights into
   the inhibitory mechanism of gold complexes against hIAPP fibrillization.

Abstract = {{We present a new algorithm to measure time-lapse vertical traveltime
   shifts in seismic pre-stack shot and CMP gathers by tracking traces
   having constant horizontal slowness in tau-p space. Unlike other methods
   for measuring these attributes from stacked volumes, our use of
   pre-stack data avoids errors and uncertainties inevitably introduced in
   conventional time-lapse processing, such as choosing a suitable
   migration velocity model and cross-correlation time-window size. Results
   are localised to a given interval and thus free from overburden effects.
   This approach is used to estimate layer vertical traveltime shifts, a
   reservoir compaction-dilation coefficient, and hence calculate both
   velocity and thickness changes within a reservoir and the overburden. We
   demonstrate the method using synthetic reflection data generated using
   both a ray-based and a finite-difference full-waveform algorithms on two
   suites of models: a simple four-layer reservoir model; and a
   hydro-mechanical simulation model. We compare our estimates of layer
   interval vertical time-lapse traveltime shifts and velocity and
   thickness changes with those of the input model. The results indicate
   that the new tau-p time-lapse method produces sufficiently accurate
   results compared to conventional methods.}},

Abstract = {{Level-of-detail (LOD) rendering is a key optimization used by modern
   video game engines to achieve high-quality rendering with fast
   performance. These LOD systems require simplified shaders, but
   generating simplified shaders remains largely a manual optimization task
   for game developers. Prior efforts to automate this process have taken
   hours to generate simplified shader candidates, making them impractical
   for use in modern shader authoring workflows for complex scenes. We
   present an end-to-end system for automatically generating a LOD policy
   for an input shader. The system operates on shaders used in both forward
   and deferred rendering pipelines, requires no additional semantic
   information beyond input shader source code, and in only seconds to
   minutes generates LOD policies ( consisting of simplified shader, the
   desired LOD distance set, and transition generation) with performance
   and quality characteristics comparable to custom hand-authored
   solutions. Our design contributes new shader simplification transforms
   such as approximate common subexpression elimination and movement of GPU
   logic to parameter bind-time processing on the CPU, and it uses a greedy
   search algorithm that employs extensive caching and up-front collection
   of input shader statistics to rapidly identify simplified shaders with
   desirable performance-quality trade-offs.}},

Abstract = {{An integrated grounding system (IGS) plays a significant role in
   reliable operations of a high-speed railway (HSR). The defect problems
   of grounding conductors have been frequently occurring due to the
   long-time service of an IGS and the large current from a traction
   system. Therefore, defect diagnosis should be conducted. Considering the
   topology of an IGS and the distribution feature of the surface
   potential, a method is proposed here to diagnose and locate the defect
   of the IGS. The grounding conductors can be classified into two main
   categories, i.e., the grounding grid in a traction substation and the
   integrated grounding line along a track. The surface potentials, which
   resulted from the IGS, can be investigated through the electromagnetic
   calculation of the grounding conductors. Thus, the relationship between
   the surface potentials and the levels of conductor corrosion can be
   quantified. As a result, the breakpoint location and the levels of the
   conductor corrosion of the grounding conductors can be determined by the
   surface potentials calculated. Finally, the IGS model is simulated in
   the current distribution, electromagnetic fields, grounding, and soil
   structure (CDEGS) analysis software, and the results verify the accuracy
   of the proposed model.}},

Abstract = {{In December 2013 BexseroA (R) became available in Germany for
   vaccination against serogroup B meningococci (MenB). In August 2015 the
   German Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) endorsed a
   recommendation for use of this vaccine in persons at increased risk of
   invasive meningococcal disease (IMD). This background paper summarizes
   the evidence underlying the recommendation. BexseroA (R) is based on
   surface protein antigens expressed by about 80 \% of circulating
   serogroup B meningococci in Germany. The paper reviews available data on
   immunogenicity and safety of BexseroA (R) in healthy children and
   adolescents; data in persons with underlying illness and on the
   effectiveness in preventing clinical outcomes are thus far unavailable.
   STIKO recommends MenB vaccination for the following persons based on an
   individual risk assessment: (1) Persons with congenital or acquired
   immune deficiency or suppression. Among these, persons with terminal
   complement defects and properdin deficiency, including those under
   eculizumab therapy, are at highest risk with reported invasive
   meningococcal disease (IMD) incidences up 10,000-fold higher than in the
   general population. Persons with asplenia were estimated to have a
   similar to 20-30-fold increased risk of IMD, while the risk in
   individuals with other immune defects such as HIV infection or
   hypogammaglobulinaemia was estimated at no more than 5-10-fold higher
   than the background risk. (2) Laboratory staff with a risk of exposure
   to N. meningitidis aerosols, for whom an up to 271-fold increased risk
   for IMD has been reported. (3) Unvaccinated household (-like) contacts
   of a MenB IMD index case, who have a roughly 100-200-fold increased IMD
   risk in the year after the contact despite chemoprophylaxis. Because the
   risk is highest in the first 3 months and full protective immunity
   requires more than one dose (particularly in infants and toddlers), MenB
   vaccine should be administered as soon as possible following
   identification of the serogroup of the index case.}},

Title = {{Age impact on human papillomavirus vaccination in France in 2014: A
   study from the National Health Insurance Database}},

Abstract = {{Introduction > Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the main cause of cervical
   cancer. In France, since March 2007, HPV vaccination has been
   recommended for girls aged 14, in addition to a catch-up program for
   girls aged 15 to 23. In October 2012, the target population was changed
   to 11-to 14-year-old girls. The main objective of the present study was
   to evaluate the impact of the recommendation change on HPV vaccination
   coverage and compliance.
   Methods > We conducted a descriptive study of the Echantillon eneraliste
   des Beneficiaires (EGB), which is a random 1/97 permanent sample from
   the French National Health Insurance Database. We focused our analyses
   on girls aged 11 to 17 years who were covered by the main insurance
   scheme (which covers 77\% of the French population).
   Results > We included 16,195 girls in this analysis. At the last update
   of the database (06/15/2014), 42\% of 17-year-old girls had been
   vaccinated, with more than 50\% of them having been vaccinated at age
   14. Between January 2012 and June 2014, patients were reimbursed for a
   total of 7698 doses of the HPV vaccine. During the first trimester of
   2013, the number of vaccinated 11- to 13-year-old girls increased,
   growing by more than 20-fold between the last trimester of 2012 (n = 8)
   and the last trimester of 2013 (n = 178). Less than 60\% of the
   vaccinated patients received 3 injections.
   Discussion > Implementation of the new recommendations was rapid but had
   only a slight impact on vaccination coverage.}},

Title = {{Breast dose in mammography is about 30\% lower when realistic
   heterogeneous glandular distributions are considered}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{6337-6348}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Current dosimetry methods in mammography assume that the breast
   is comprised of a homogeneous mixture of glandular and adipose tissues.
   Three-dimensional (3D) dedicated breast CT (bCT) data sets were used
   previously to assess the complex anatomical structure within the breast,
   characterizing the statistical distribution of glandular tissue in the
   breast. The purpose of this work was to investigate the effect of
   bCT-derived heterogeneous glandular distributions on dosimetry in
   mammography.
   Methods: bCT-derived breast diameters, volumes, and 3D fibroglandular
   distributions were used to design realistic compressed breast models
   comprised of heterogeneous distributions of glandular tissue. The
   bCT-derived glandular distributions were fit to biGaussian functions and
   used as probability density maps to assign the density distributions
   within compressed breast models. The MCNPX 2.6.0 Monte Carlo code was
   used to estimate monoenergetic normalized mean glandular dose
   ``DgN(E){''} values in mammography geometry. The DgN(E) values were then
   weighted by typical mammography x-ray spectra to determine polyenergetic
   DgN (pDgN) coefficients for heterogeneous (pDgN(hetero)) and homogeneous
   (pDgN(homo)) cases. The dependence of estimated pDgN values on phantom
   size, volumetric glandular fraction (VGF), x-ray technique factors, and
   location of the heterogeneous glandular distributions was investigated.
   Results: The pDgNhetero coefficients were on average 35.3\% (SD, 4.1)
   and 24.2\% (SD, 3.0) lower than the pDgN(homo) coefficients for the
   Mo-Mo and W-Rh x-ray spectra, respectively, across all phantom sizes and
   VGFs when the glandular distributions were centered within the breast
   phantom in the coronal plane. At constant breast size, increasing VGF
   from 7.3\% to 19.1\% lead to a reduction in pDgN(hetero) relative to
   pDgN(homo) of 23.6\%-27.4\% for a W-Rh spectrum. Displacement of the
   glandular distribution, at a distance equal to 10\% of the compressed
   breast width in the superior and inferior directions, resulted in a
   37.3\% and a -26.6\% change in the pDgN(hetero) coefficient,
   respectively, relative to the centered distribution for the Mo-Mo
   spectrum. Lateral displacement of the glandular distribution, at a
   distance equal to 10\% of the compressed breast width, resulted in a
   1.5\% change in the pDgN(hetero) coefficient relative to the centered
   distribution for the W-Rh spectrum.
   Conclusions: Introducing bCT-derived heterogeneous glandular
   distributions into mammography phantom design resulted in decreased
   glandular dose relative to the widely used homogeneous assumption. A
   homogeneous distribution overestimates the amount of glandular tissue
   near the entrant surface of the breast, where dose deposition is
   exponentially higher. While these findings are based on clinically
   measured distributions of glandular tissue using a large cohort of
   women, future work is required to improve the classification of
   glandular distributions based on breast size and overall glandular
   fraction. (C) 2015 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.}},

Abstract = {{A series of new hybrid peralkylated amine-guanidine ligands based on a
   1,3-propanediamine backbone and their Cu-O-2 chemistry is reported. The
   copper(I) complexes react readily with O-2 at low temperatures in
   aprotic solvents with weakly coordinating anions to form exclusively
   bis(mu-oxo) dicopper species (O). Variation of the substituents on each
   side of the hybrid bidentate ligand reveal that less sterically
   demanding amine and guanidine substituents increase not only the thermal
   stability of the formed O cores but also enhance innersphere phenolate
   hydroxylation pathways. TD-DFT analysis on selected guanidine-amine O
   species suggest that the additional visible-wavelength feature observed
   is a guanidine pi{*} -> Cu2O2 LMCT, which appears along with the classic
   oxo-sigma(u){*} -> Cu-III and pi(sigma){*} -> Cu-III LMCT transitions.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to address facilitators for successful
   interprofessional collaboration (IPC) between social workers (SWs) and
   teachers. Individual interviews were carried out with seven SWs employed
   in municipal child welfare services and six teachers from primary and
   secondary schools. The informants had at least two years' experience
   within multidisciplinary teams. The transcripts were analysed using an
   inductive thematic approach and the NVIVO9 computer software package for
   qualitative data analysis. Thematic analysis revealed three themes:
   personal commitments', creating a positive atmosphere for IPC' and
   pulling together towards future goals'. Results are discussed in
   relation to the Norwegian context concerning IPC in multidisciplinary
   teams for children at risk.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: We examined the effect of combined vitamin D and calcium
   supplementation (VDCS) on urinary calcium excretion and de novo stone
   formation in vitamin D inadequate (VDI) urolithiasis patients.
   Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the data of VDI patients (serum
   25-hydroxyvitamin D < 75 nmol/L) followed at a tertiary stone centre
   between September 2009 and December 2014. VDI patients with history of
   urolithiasis, who were placed on VDCS for abnormal bone mineral density
   or hyperoxaluria, were included. Hypercalciuric patients and patients on
   thiazide diuretics were excluded. Metabolic stone workup and two 24-hour
   urine collections were performed before and after VDCS.
   Results: In total, we included 34 patients, with a mean age of 54.8
   years and a mean body mass index of 25.7 kg/m(2). After VDCS, there was
   a significant increase in the mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (52.0 vs.
   66.4 nmol/L, p < 0.001) and the mean urinary calcium excretion (3.80 vs.
   5.64 mmol/d, p < 0.001). Eight (23.5\%) patients developed de novo
   hypercalciuria. After a median followup of 39 (range: 7-60) months, 50\%
   of hypercalciuric patients developed stones compared with 11.5\% of
   non-hypercalciuric patients (p = 0.038).
   Conclusion: This study showed a significant effect of combined VDCS on
   mean urinary calcium excretion, de novo hypercalciuria, and stone
   development in VDI patients with history of urolithiasis. Therefore, VDI
   urolithiasis patients receiving VDCS are advised to have monitoring with
   24-hour urine collections and imaging studies. Although small, our
   sample size was good enough to validate the statistical outcomes.
   Prospective studies are needed to confirm these results.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To identify and report on the relative importance of factors
   influencing nurse managers' intentions to stay in or leave their current
   position.
   Background Effective nurse managers play an important role in staff
   nurse retention and in the quality of patient care. The advancing age of
   nurse managers, multiple job opportunities within nursing and the
   generally negative perceptions of the manager role can contribute to
   difficulties in retaining nurse managers.
   Methods Ninety-five Canadian nurse managers participated in a web
   survey. Respondents rated the importance of factors related to their
   intent to leave or stay in their current position for another 2 years.
   Descriptive, t-test and MANCOVA statistics were used to assess
   differences between managers intending to stay or leave.
   Results For managers intending to leave (n = 28), the most important
   factors were work overload, inability to ensure quality patient care,
   insufficient resources, and lack of empowerment and recognition.
   Managers intending to leave reported significantly lower job
   satisfaction, perceptions of their supervisor's resonant leadership and
   higher burnout levels.
   Implications for nursing management Organisations wishing to retain
   existing nurse managers and to attract front-line staff into leadership
   positions must create and foster an environment that supports nurse
   managers.}},

Abstract = {{Transposable elements (TEs) constitute a substantial fraction of the
   eukaryotic genome and, as a result, have a complex relationship with
   their host that is both adversarial and dependent. To minimize damage to
   cellular genes, TEs possess mechanisms that target integration to
   sequences of low importance. However, the retrotransposon Tf1 of
   Schizosaccharomyces pombe integrates with a surprising bias for promoter
   sequences of stress-response genes. The clustering of integration in
   specific promoters suggests that Tf1 possesses a targeting mechanism
   that is important for evolutionary adaptation to changes in environment.
   We report here that Sap1, an essential DNA-binding protein, plays an
   important role in Tf1 integration. A mutation in Sap1 resulted in a
   10-fold drop in Tf1 transposition, and measures of transposon
   intermediates support the argument that the defect occurred in the
   process of integration. Published ChIP-Seq data on Sap1 binding combined
   with high-density maps of Tf1 integration that measure independent
   insertions at single-nucleotide positions show that 73.4\% of all
   integration occurs at genomic sequences bound by Sap1. This represents
   high selectivity because Sap1 binds just 6.8\% of the genome. A
   genome-wide analysis of promoter sequences revealed that Sap1 binding
   and amounts of integration correlate strongly. More important, an
   alignment of the DNA-binding motif of Sap1 revealed integration
   clustered on both sides of the motif and showed high levels specifically
   at positions +19 and -9. These data indicate that Sap1 contributes to
   the efficiency and position of Tf1 integration.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Motor control therapeutic exercise (MCTE) for the neck is a
   motor relearning program that emphasizes the coordination and
   contraction of specific neck flexor, extensor, and shoulder girdle
   muscles. Because motor imagery (MI) improves sensorimotor function and
   it improves several motor aspects, such as motor learning, neuromotor
   control, and acquisition of motor skills, the authors hypothesized that
   a combination of MCTE and MI would improve the sensorimotor function of
   the cervical spine more effectively than a MCTE program alone.
   Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of
   MI combined with a MCTE program on sensorimotor function of the
   craniocervical region in asymptomatic subjects.
   Study Design: This study was a single-blinded randomized controlled
   trial.
   Methods: Forty asymptomatic subjects were assigned to a MCTE group or a
   MCTE+ MI group. Both groups received the same MCTE program for the
   cervical region (60 minutes), but the MCTE + MI group received an
   additional intervention based on MI (15 minutes). The primary outcomes
   assessed were craniocervical neuromotor control (activation pressure
   value and highest pressure value), cervical kinesthetic sense (joint
   position error {[}JPE]), and the subjective perception of fatigue after
   effort.
   Results: Intra-group significant differences were obtained between
   pre-and post interventions for all evaluated variables (p<0.01) in the
   MCTE + MI and MCTE groups, except for craniocervical neuromotor control
   and the subjective perception of fatigue after effort in the MCTE group.
   In the MCTE + MI group a large effect size was found for craniocervical
   neuromotor control (d between -0.94 and -1.41), cervical kinesthetic
   sense (d between 0.97 and 2.14), neck flexor muscle endurance test (d =
   -1.50), and subjective perception of fatigue after effort (d = 0.79).
   There were significant intergroup differences for the highest pressure
   value, joint position error (JPE) extension, JPE left rotation, and
   subjective perception of fatigue after effort.
   Conclusion: The combined MI and MCTE intervention produced statistically
   significant changes in sensorimotor function variables of the
   craniocervical region (highest pressure value, JPE extension and JPE
   left rotation) and the perception of subjective fatigue compared to MCTE
   alone. Both groups showed statistically significant changes in all
   variables measured, except for craniocervical neuromotor control and the
   subjective perception of fatigue after effort in the MCTE group}},

Abstract = {{When pathogens invade the insect hemocoel (body cavity) they immediately
   confront two major forces: immune-responses and circulatory currents.
   The immune response is mediated by circulating and sessile hemocytes,
   the fat body, the midgut, and the salivary glands. These tissues drive
   cellular and humoral immune processes that kill pathogens via
   phagocytosis, melanization, lysis, encapsulation, and nodulation.
   Moreover, immune-responses take place within a three-dimensional and
   dynamic space that is governed by the forces of the circulatory system.
   The circulation of hemolymph (insect blood) is primarily controlled by
   the wave-like contraction of a dorsal vessel, which is a muscular tube
   that extends the length of the insect and is divided into a thoracic
   aorta and an abdominal heart. Distributed along the heart are valves,
   called ostia, that allow hemolymph to enter the vessel. Once inside the
   heart, hemolymph is sequentially propelled to the anterior and to the
   posterior of the body. During an infection, circulatory currents sweep
   small pathogens to all regions of the body. As they circulate, pathogens
   encounter immune factors of the insect that range from soluble cytotoxic
   peptides to phagocytic hemocytes. A prominent location for these
   encounters is the surface of the heart. Specifically, periostial
   hemocytes aggregate in the extracardiac regions that flank the heart's
   ostia (the periostial regions) and phagocytoze pathogens in areas of
   high flow of hemolymph. This review summarizes the biology of the immune
   and circulatory systems of insects, including how these two systems have
   co-adapted to fight infection. This review also compares the immune and
   circulatory systems of insects to that of crustaceans, and details how
   attachment of hemocytes to cardiac tissues and the biology of the
   lymphoid organ demonstrate that dynamic interactions between the immune
   and circulatory systems also occur in lineages of crustaceans.}},

Abstract = {{Bone loss in multiple myeloma (MM) is caused by an uncoupling of bone
   formation to resorption trigged by malignant plasma cells. Increasing
   evidence indicates that the bone remodelling compartment (BRC) canopy,
   which normally covers the remodelling sites, is important for coupled
   bone remodelling. Loss of this canopy has been associated with bone
   loss. This study addresses whether the bone remodelling in MM is
   improved by high-dose therapy. Bone marrow biopsies obtained from 20 MM
   patients, before and after first-line treatment with high-dose melphalan
   followed by autologous stem cell transplantation, and from 20 control
   patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance were
   histomorphometrically investigated. This investigation confirmed that MM
   patients exhibited uncoupled bone formation to resorption and reduced
   canopy coverage. More importantly, this study revealed that a good
   response to anti-myeloma treatment increased the extent of formative
   bone surfaces with canopy, and reduced the extent of eroded surfaces
   without canopy, reverting the uncoupled bone remodelling, while
   improving canopy coverage. The association between improved coupling and
   the canopy coverage supports the notion that canopies are critical for
   the coupling of bone formation to resorption. Furthermore, this study
   supports the observation that systemic bone disease in MM can be
   reversed in MM patients responding to antimyeloma treatment.}},

Abstract = {{To prospectively compare patellofemoral and femorotibial alignment in
   supine non-weight-bearing computed tomography (NWBCT) and upright
   weight-bearing CT (WBCT) and assess the differences in joint alignment.
   NWBCT and WBCT images of the knee were obtained in 26 patients (mean
   age, 57.0 +/- 15.9 years; range, 21-81) using multiple detector CT for
   NWBCT and cone-beam extremity CT for WBCT. Two musculoskeletal
   radiologists independently quantified joint alignment by measuring
   femorotibial rotation, tibial tuberosity-trochlear groove distance
   (TTTG), lateral patellar tilt angle, lateral patellar shift, and medial
   and lateral femorotibial joint space widths. Significant differences
   between NWBCT and WBCT were sought using Wilcoxon signed-rank test
   (P-value < 0.05).
   Significant differences were found for femorotibial rotation (the NWBCT
   mean changed from 2.7A degrees A +/- 5.1 (reader 1)/2.6A degrees A +/-
   5.6 (reader 2) external rotation to WBCT 0.4A degrees A +/- 7.7/0.2A

Abstract = {{The geochemistry of interstitial waters associated with active marine
   hydrocarbon seepage provides insight into the source and ongoing
   dynamics of such systems. In this investigation of interstitial waters
   obtained from sediments in a gas hydrate region of the Sea of Japan, we
   compare carbon isotopic composition (delta C-13) of dissolved inorganic
   carbon (DIC) at the sulfate-methane transition (SMT) with delta C-13 of
   deeply sourced methane (as inferred from the deepest samples obtained
   beneath the SMT). Based on this comparison, we distinguish two causes
   for lower values of delta C-13(DIC) at the SMT. In Group A (17 piston
   cores), delta C-13(DIC) values at the SMT (-30.0 to -9.7 parts per
   thousand VPDB) correlate positively with delta C-13 of deep methane
   (-90.7 to -61.4 parts per thousand VPDB). Lowering of these delta
   C-13(DIC) values was independent of methane flux, which controls the
   generation rate of methane-derived bicarbonate by anaerobic oxidation of
   methane, owing to the influence of a high alkalinity flux from depth. In
   the Group B core samples, delta C-13(DIC) at the SMT (-41.6 to - 14.2
   parts per thousand VPDB) relative to delta C-13 of deep methane (-68.2
   to -40.5 parts per thousand VPDB) is lower than that of Group A,
   implying a greater contribution of methane-derived HCO3-. With only two
   exceptions, the Group B core sites were located at areas of active gas
   seepage. The admixture of methane from migrating methane bubbles with
   deep methane in the interstitial waters of sediments has the potential
   to significantly increase the overall methane flux at gas seep sites.
   Although the admixture may reflect higher delta C-13 values of deep
   methane, the increase in methane flux results in a higher proportion of
   methane-derived HCO3- and lower delta C-13(DIC) at the SMT. Recovery of
   two group B cores adjacent a dormant pockmark suggests that the
   depression with seismic blanking beneath it, similar to that of the gas
   seep sites, is a previous gas seepage site. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Human enteric viruses constitute a public health concern due to their
   low infectious dose and their resistance to environmental factors and to
   inactivation processes. We aimed at assessing the performance of a
   laboratory scale Submerged membrane bioreactor (SMBR) treating abattoir
   wastewaters for Rotavirus (RV) and total coliphages removal. We also
   aimed at evaluating removal efficiency of enteric viruses through
   conventional activated sludge treatment by measuring concentrations of
   total coliphages, considered as fecal and viral contamination
   indicators, with double-layer agar technique. The Log(10) reduction
   values of bacteriophages ranged from 1.06 to 1.47. Effluents were
   analyzed to investigate and quantify RV, hepatitis A virus (HAV),
   Hepatitis E virus (HEV), Noroviruses genogroup I (NoV GI) and genogroup
   II (NoVGII), and Enterovirus (EV) by real-time PCR, using standardized
   detection kits (ceeramTools detection kits(A (R))). All effluent samples
   were positive for RV; concentrations ranged from 5.2 x 10(5) to 1.3 x
   10(7) genome copies/L. These results highlight the inefficiency of
   conventional biological process for viral removal. A complete removal of
   RV during Membrane Bioreactor treatment was obtained. To the best of our
   knowledge, this is the first study providing an evidence of removal of
   RV simultaneously with total coliphages by SMBR.}},

Abstract = {{Distinguishing between invasive urothelial carcinoma from other
   genitourinary lesions such as prostatic and renal carcinomas can be
   difficult, and may require highly sensitive immunohistochemical markers.
   GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA3) has been reported in a high percentage of
   urothelial and breast carcinomas. Mouse monoclonal uroplakin II (UPII)
   and p40 antibodies have recently been developed and demonstrated high
   specificity in urothelial carcinoma. This study evaluated the
   immunohistochemical staining sensitivities of UPII, GATA3, p40, and p63
   in the detection of invasive urothelial carcinoma. UPII, GATA3, and p40
   were further tested for specificity in lung, breast, colon, kidney, and
   prostate cancers. In all invasive urothelial carcinoma cases, UPII,
   GATA3, p40, and p63 exhibited sensitivities of 77.7\%, 83.5\%, 85.4\%,
   and 80.6\%, respectively. The combination of UPII, GATA3, and p40
   antibodies stained 94.2\% (97/103) of all invasive urothelial carcinoma
   cases, including 92.2\% (71/77) of grade 2-3 urothelial carcinomas. In
   addition, GATA3 and UPII showed negative staining in lung squamous cell
   carcinomas and p40 showed negative staining in breast infiltrating
   ductal carcinomas. The combination of UPII, GATA3, and p40 showed
   negative staining in lung adenocarcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, and
   renal carcinomas. In conclusion, UPII, GATA3, and p40, when used in
   combination, are highly sensitive in the differential diagnosis of
   invasive urothelial carcinoma.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the methodology to create multiple frequency
   modes in a multiresonator system of one transmitter and multiple
   receivers based on the circuit theory. The multiple frequencies from
   natural responses of magnetic couplings could be obtained by determining
   the eigenvalues of a matrix equation. This potentially allows us to
   diversify transmissions to and from devices. Theoretical calculations
   and experiments show similar results of the multiple frequencies at
   given coupling conditions. Models of two, three, and four coils in
   straight line demonstrate the splitting mode in the spectral domain,
   which are validated by envelopes of signals. In measurements, three
   frequencies of 525, 625, and 695 kHz, and four frequencies of 495, 590,
   670, and 755 kHz are achieved at the receiver for three-and four-coil
   models, respectively, when coils are equally distanced by 2 cm. When
   coupling coefficient of every adjacent coil in three-coil model is 0.2,
   aggregating the peak power at two and three splitting modes result in
   28\% and 71\%, respectively, more power than that at resonance
   frequency. Similarly, with two, three, and four modes in four-coil
   model, the increases are 43\%, 23\%, and 33\% with two, three, and four
   modes, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale baroclinic instability is investigated as a potential source
   of Rossby waves and large-scale variability in the ocean. This
   baroclinic instability is first reviewed in a 2.5-layer model. As
   already noticed by several authors, the instability arises in westward
   surface mean flow when the phase velocities of the two vertical modes
   are made equal by mean flow influence. This large-scale instability is
   stronger at low latitudes and thus is likely to happen in the westward
   return flow of the subtropical gyres. Further investigations with a
   continuous stratification quasigeostrophic model show that the
   instability is stronger where the mean flow projects negatively on the
   second baroclinic mode (imposing positive vertical modes at the
   surface). The linear stability calculation is then performed on
   Argo-derived mean flow along with mean stratification data. The results
   show that the unstable regions are situated at low latitudes in every
   oceanic basin, in western boundary currents, and in some part of the
   Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The location of these unstable regions is
   well correlated with the region of negative projection of the mean flow
   on the second baroclinic mode. Given that the unstable mode growth times
   are generally smaller than 6 months at low latitudes, these unstable
   modes are likely to be observable in satellite altimetry. Therefore,
   results of the present article suggest that the large-scale instability
   is indeed a source of large-scale variability at low latitudes.}},

Abstract = {{Russian dandelion (Taraxacum kok-sagyz Rodin; TKS) is a promising
   candidate for introducing natural rubber production into North America;
   however, a comprehensive analysis of factors that influence flowering is
   essential for efficient breeding and crop development. The objectives of
   this study were to determine the effects of fall harvest date (early
   September, October and November), post-harvest vernalization (0, 4 and 8
   wk at 4 degrees C), and greenhouse regrowth temperature {[}15/13 degrees
   C or 21/18 degrees C (day/night)] on flower induction. The vernalization
   requirements (0, 4, 8 and 12 wk at 4 degrees C) to reflower TKS plants
   were also examined in controlled environments at 21/18 degrees C. Plants
   harvested in September or October required 4 wk of vernalization and
   growth at 15/13 degrees C to maximize the percentage of plants with
   flower buds and minimize the time for flower bud appearance. Those
   harvested in November flowered quickly and at high frequency with no
   vernalization and regrowth at 21/18 degrees C. Vernalization was not
   essential to re-induce flowering; 80-100\% of plants flowered regardless
   of treatment. Various combinations of harvest dates, vernalization
   periods and regrowth temperatures can be used to maximize flowering in
   TKS and have a positive impact on germplasm development.}},

   regularization of the quantale of all join preserving self-maps of the

   identified with strong homomorphisms taking their values in the
   quantisation of 2. A quantale is spatial iff strong homomorphisms with
   values in the quantisation of 2 separate elements. Since the adjunction
   between locales and topological spaces has a non-commutative extension
   to an adjunction between quantales and many valued topological spaces,
   every spatial semiunital quantale can be identified with a many-valued
   sober space. This result is applied to the topologization of spectra of

Abstract = {{The endocannabinoid system (ECS) comprises the cannabinoid receptors CB1
   and CB2 and their endogenous arachidonic acid-derived agonists
   2-arachidonoyl glycerol and anandamide, which play important
   neuromodulatory roles. Recently, a novel class of negative allosteric
   CB1 receptor peptide ligands, hemopressin-like peptides derived from
   alpha hemoglobin, has been described, with yet unknown origin and
   function in the CNS. Using monoclonal antibodies we now identified the
   localization of RVD-hemopressin (pepcan-12) and N-terminally extended
   peptide endocannabinoids (pepcans) in the CNS and determined their
   neuronal origin. Immunohistochemical analyses in rodents revealed
   distinctive and specific staining in major groups of noradrenergic
   neurons, including the locus coeruleus (LC), A1, A5 and A7 neurons,
   which appear to be major sites of production/release in the CNS. No
   staining was detected in dopaminergic neurons. Peptidergic axons were
   seen throughout the brain (notably hippocampus and cerebral cortex) and
   spinal cord, indicative of anterograde axonal transport of pepcans.
   Intriguingly, the chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla were also
   strongly stained for pepcans. We found specific co-expression of pepcans
   with galanin, both in the LC and adrenal gland. Using LC-MS/MS,
   pepcan-12 was only detected in non-perfused brain (similar to 40
   pmol/g), suggesting that in the CNS it is secreted and present in
   extracellular compartments. In adrenal glands, significantly more
   pepcan-12 (400-700 pmol/g) was measured in both non-perfused and
   perfused tissues. Thus, chromaffin cells may be a major production site
   of pepcan-12 found in blood. These data uncover important areas of
   peptide endocannabinoid occurrence with exclusive noradrenergic
   immunohistochemical staining, opening new doors to investigate their
   potential physiological function in the ECS.

Abstract = {{Red-naped sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus nuchalis) are functionally important
   because they create sapwells and cavities that other species use for
   food and nesting. Red-naped sapsucker ecology within aspen (Populus
   tremuloides) has been well studied, but relatively little is known about
   red-naped sapsuckers in conifer forests. We used light detection and
   ranging (LiDAR) data to examine occupancy patterns of red-naped
   sapsuckers in a conifer-dominated system. We surveyed for sapsuckers at
   162 sites in northern Idaho, USA, during 2009 and 2010. We used
   occupancy models and an information-theoretic approach to model
   sapsucker occupancy as a function of four LiDAR-based metrics that
   characterized vegetation structure and tree harvest, and one non-LiDAR
   metric that characterized distance to major roads. We evaluated model
   support across a range of territory sizes using Akaike's information
   criterion. Top model support was highest at the 4-ha extent, which
   suggested that 4ha was the most relevant scale describing sapsucker
   occupancy. Sapsuckers were positively associated with variation of
   canopy height and harvested area, and negatively associated with shrub
   and large tree density. These results suggest that harvest regimes and
   structural diversity of vegetation at moderate extents (e.g., 4ha)
   largely influence occurrence of red-naped sapsuckers in conifer forests.
   Given the current and projected declines of aspen populations, it will
   be increasingly important to assess habitat relationships, as well as
   demographic characteristics, of aspen-associated species such as
   red-naped sapsuckers within conifer-dominated systems to meet future
   management and conservation goals.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we report the epidemiology and risk factors for humeral
   fractures (proximal humerus and shaft) among men and women residing in
   south-eastern Australia. Incident fractures during 2006 and 2007 were
   identified using X-ray reports (Geelong Osteoporosis Study Fracture
   Grid). Risk factors were identified using data from case-control studies
   conducted as part of the Geelong Osteoporosis Study. Median age of
   fracture was lower in males than females for proximal humerus (33.0 vs
   71.2 years), but not for humeral shaft (8.9 vs 8.5 years). For females,
   proximal humerus fractures occurred mainly in the 70-79 and 80+ years
   age groups, whereas humeral shaft fractures followed a U-shaped pattern.
   Males showed a U-shaped pattern for both proximal humerus and humeral
   shaft fractures. Overall age-standardised incidence rates for proximal
   humerus fractures in males and females were 40.6 (95 \% CI 32.7, 48.5)
   and 73.2 (95 \% CI 62.2, 84.1) per 100,000 person years, respectively.
   For humeral shaft fractures, the age-standardised rate was 69.3 (95 \%
   CI 59.0, 79.6) for males and 61.5 (95 \% CI 51.9, 71.0) for females.
   There was an increase in risk of proximal humerus fractures in men with
   a lower femoral neck BMD, younger age, prior fracture and higher milk
   consumption. In pre-menopausal women, increased height and falls were
   both risk factors for proximal humerus fractures. For post-menopausal
   women, risk factors associated with proximal humerus fractures included
   a lower non-milk dairy consumption and sustaining a prior fracture.
   Humeral shaft fractures in both sexes were sustained mainly in
   childhood, while proximal humerus fractures were sustained in older
   adulthood. The overall age-standardised rates of proximal humerus
   fractures were nearly twice as high in females compared to males,
   whereas the incidence rates of humeral shaft fractures were similar.}},

Abstract = {{Calculations of the principal components of magnetic-shielding tensors
   in crystalline solids require the inclusion of the effects of lattice
   structure on the local electronic environment to obtain significant
   agreement with experimental NMR measurements. We assess periodic (GIPAW)
   and GIAO/symmetry-adapted cluster (SAC) models for computing
   magnetic-shielding tensors by calculations on a test set containing 72
   insulating molecular solids, with a total of 393 principal components of
   chemical-shift tensors from C-13, N-15, F-19, and P-31 sites. When
   clusters are carefully designed to represent the local solid-state
   environment and when periodic calculations include sufficient
   variability, both methods predict magnetic-shielding tensors that agree
   well with experimental chemical-shift values, demonstrating the
   correspondence of the two computational techniques. At the basis-set
   limit, we find that the small differences in the computed values have no
   statistical significance for three of the four nuclides considered.
   Subsequently, we explore the effects of additional DFT methods available
   only with the GIAO/duster approach, particularly the use of hybrid-GGA
   functionals, meta-GGA functionals, and hybrid meta-GGA functionals that
   demonstrate improved agreement in calculations on symmetry-adapted
   clusters. We demonstrate that meta-GGA functionals improve computed NMR
   parameters over those obtained by GGA functionals in all cases, and that
   hybrid functionals improve computed results over the respective pure DFT
   functional for all nuclides except N-15.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. Little is known about how physicians present diagnosis and
   treatment planning in routine practice in preference-sensitive treatment
   decisions. We evaluated completeness and quality of informed decision
   making in localized prostate cancer post biopsy encounters. Methods. We
   analyzed audio-recorded office visits of 252 men with presumed localized
   prostate cancer (Gleason 6 and Gleason 7 scores) who were seeing 45
   physicians at 4 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. Data were collected
   between September 2008 and May 2012 in a trial of 2 decision aids (DAs).
   Braddock's previously validated Informed Decision Making (IDM) system
   was used to measure quality. Latent variable models for ordinal data
   examined the relationship of IDM score to treatment received. Results.
   Mean IDM score showed modest quality (7.61 +/- 2.45 out of 18) and high
   variability. Treatment choice and risks and benefits were discussed in
   approximately 95\% of encounters. However, in more than one-third of
   encounters, physicians provided a partial set of treatment options and
   omitted surveillance as a choice. Informing quality was greater in
   patients treated with surveillance ( = 1.1, p = .04). Gleason score (7
   vs 6) and lower age were often cited as reasons to exclude surveillance.
   Patient preferences were elicited in the majority of cases, but not used
   to guide treatment planning. Encounter time was modestly correlated with
   IDM score (r = 0.237, p = .01). DA type was not associated with IDM
   score. Discussion. Physicians informed patients of options and risks and
   benefits, but infrequently engaged patients in core shared
   decision-making processes. Despite patients having received DAs,
   physicians rarely provided an opportunity for preference-driven decision
   making. More attention to the underused patient decision-making and
   engagement elements could result in improved shared decision making.}},

Abstract = {{Ligands that selectively inhibit human alpha 3 beta 2 and alpha 6 beta 2
   nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChRs) and not the closely related
   alpha 3 beta 4 and alpha 6 beta 4 subtypes are lacking. Current
   alpha-conotoxins (alpha-Ctxs) that discriminate among these nAChR
   subtypes in rat fail to discriminate among the human receptor homologs.
   In this study, we describe the development of alpha-Ctx LvIA(N9R, V10A)
   that is 3000-fold more potent on oocyte-expressed human alpha 3 beta 2
   than alpha 3 beta 4 and 165-fold more potent on human alpha 6/alpha 3
   beta 2 beta 3 than alpha 6/alpha 3 beta 4 nAChRs. This analog was used
   in conjuction with three other alpha-Ctx analogs and patch-clamp
   electrophysiology to characterize the nAChR subtypes expressed by human
   adrenal chromaffin cells. LvIA(N9R, V10A) showed little effect on the
   acetylcholine-evoked currents in these cells at concentrations expected
   to inhibit nAChRs with beta 2 ligand-binding sites. In contrast, the
   beta 4-selective alpha-Ctx BuIA(T5A, P6O) inhibited >98\% of the
   acetylcholine-evoked current, indicating that most of the heteromeric
   receptors contained beta 4 ligand-binding sites. Additional studies
   using the alpha 6-selective alpha-Ctx PeIA(A7V, S9H, V10A, N11R, E14A)
   indicated that the predominant heteromeric nAChR expressed by human
   adrenal chromaffin cells is the alpha 3 beta 4{*} subtype (asterisk
   indicates the possible presence of additional subunits). This conclusion
   was supported by polymerase chain reaction experiments of human adrenal
   medulla gland and of cultured human adrenal chromaffin cells that
   demonstrated prominent expression of RNAs for alpha 3, alpha 5, alpha 7,
   beta 2, and beta 4 subunits and a low abundance of RNAs for alpha 2,
   alpha 4, alpha 6, and alpha 10 subunits.}},

   free corrosion potential, potentiodynamic polarization curves and
   electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in comparison with
   stainless steel 1Cr18Ni9Ti. The results showed that cavitation erosion
   strongly enhanced the cathodic current density, shifted the free
   corrosion potential in the anodic direction, and reduced the magnitude
   of impedance of the coating. The impedance of the coating decreased more
   slowly under cavitation conditions than that of the stainless steel
   1Cr18Ni9Ti, suggesting that corrosion behavior of the coating was less
   affected by cavitation erosion than that of the stainless steel. (C)

Abstract = {{Context: Familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHBL) is a codominant
   disorder of lipoprotein metabolism characterized by decreased plasma
   concentrations of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and
   apolipoprotein B (apoB).
   Objective: The objective was to examine the effect of heterozygous APOB
   L343V FHBL on postprandial triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (TRL) and
   fasting lipoprotein metabolism.
   Methods: Plasma incremental area under the curve apoB-48 and apoB-48
   kinetics were determined after ingestion of a standardized oral fat load
   using compartmental modeling. Very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-,
   intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL)-, and LDL-apoB kinetics were
   determined in the fasting state using stable isotope methods and
   compartmental modeling.
   Results: The postprandial incremental area under the curve (0-10 h) in
   FHBL subjects (n = 3) was lower for large TRL-triglyceride (-77\%; P <
   .0001), small TRL-cholesterol (-83\%; P < .001), small TRL-triglyceride
   (-88\%; P < .001), and for plasma triglyceride (-70\%; P < .01) and apoB
   (-63\%; P < .0001) compared with controls. Compartmental analysis showed
   that apoB-48 production was lower (-91\%; P < .05) compared with
   controls. VLDL-apoB concentrations in FHBL subjects (n = 2) were lower
   by more than 75\% compared with healthy, normolipidemic control subjects
   (P < .01). The VLDL-apoB fractional catabolic rate (FCR) was more than
   5-fold higher in the FHBL subjects (P = .07). ApoB production rates and
   IDL- and LDL-apoB FCRs were not different between FHBL subjects and
   controls.
   Conclusions: We conclude that when compared to controls, APOBL343V FHBL
   heterozygotes show lower TRL production with normal postprandial TRL
   particle clearance. In contrast, VLDL-apoB production was normal,
   whereas the FCR was higher in heterozygotes compared with lean control
   subjects. These mechanisms account for the marked hypolipidemic state
   observed in these FHBL subjects.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Military personnel and first responders (police and
   firefighters) often carry large amounts of gear. This increased load can
   negatively affect posture and lead to back pain. The ability to
   quantitatively measure muscle thickness under loading would be valuable
   to clinicians to assess the effectiveness of core stabilization
   treatment programs and could aid in return to work decisions. Ultrasound
   imaging (USI) has the potential to provide such a measure, but to be
   useful it must be reliable.
   Purpose: To assess the intrarater and interrater reliability of
   measurements of transversus abdominis (TrA) and internal oblique (IO)
   muscle thickness conducted by novice examiners using USI in supine,
   standing, and with an axial load.
   Study Design: Prospective, test-retest study
   Methods: Healthy, active duty military (N=33) personnel were examined by
   two physical therapy doctoral students (primary and secondary ultrasound
   technicians) without prior experience in USI. Thickness measurements of
   the TrA and IO muscles were performed at rest and during a contraction
   to preferentially activate the TrA in three positions (hook-lying,
   standing, and standing with body armor). Percent thickness changes and
   intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated.
   Results: Using the mean of three measurements for each of the three
   positions in resting and contracted muscle states, the intrarater ICC
   (3,3) values ranged from 0.90 to 0.98. The interrater ICC (2,1) values
   ranged from 0.39 to 0.79. The ICC values of percent thickness changes
   were lower than the individual ICC values for all positions and muscle
   states.
   Conclusion: There is excellent intrarater reliability of novice
   ultrasound technicians measuring abdominal muscle thickness using USI in
   three positions during the resting and contracted muscle states.
   However, interrater reliability of two novice technicians was poor to
   fair, so additional training and experience may be necessary to improve
   reliability.}},

Abstract = {{Studies dealing with the reconstruction of Holocene climate change of
   tropical areas are scarce. Of these, multi-proxy investigations using
   peatlands are still absent. In this paper, we present the Holocene
   record of environmental changes in central-eastern Brazil reconstructed
   from a core sampled in Pau de Fruta mire (Serra do Espinhaco Meridional,
   Brazil). We combined palynological and geochemical analyses, supported
   by core stratigraphy,C-14 dating and multivariate statistics. The
   location of the mire is ideal because it is in an area which is directly
   associated with the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ). Six main
   phases of change suggested by vegetation and local and regional
   landscape dynamics were described. In phase I (similar to 10,000-7360
   cal. yr BP) the climate was very wet and cold and was accompanied by
   soil instability in the mire catchment (severe local erosion) and the
   8.2 ka event was easily recognizable by a large increase in the
   deposition of regional dust. Phase II (similar to 7360-4200 cal. yr BP)
   was characterized by wet and warm conditions, catchment soil stability
   and enhanced deposition of regional dust. In phase III (similar to
   4200-2200 cal. yr BP), climate was dry and warm and soil erosion in the
   catchment increased again. In phase IV (similar to 2200-1160 cal. yr BP)
   dry and punctuated cooling was reconstructed, together with enhanced
   deposition of regional dust. Phase V (similar to 1160-400 cal. yr BP)
   reflects sub-humid climatic conditions (like the current climate), the
   lowest inputs of local and regional dust and the largest accumulation of
   peat in the mire. While in phase VI (<similar to 400 cal. yr BP)
   sub-humid conditions continued but both local and regional erosion
   significantly increased. Our results demonstrate that the tropical
   peatlands of Serra do Espinhaco Meridional contain relevant records of
   Holocene climate changes, and that a multi-proxy approach offers good
   opportunities for a detailed reconstruction of palaeoenvironments. (C)

Abstract = {{This article proposes that, in line with moral-cosmopolitan theorists,
   affluent nations have an obligation, founded in justice and not merely
   altruism or beneficence, to share the responsibility of the burden of
   public health implementation in low-income contexts. The current Ebola
   epidemic highlights the fact that countries with under-developed health
   systems and limited resources cannot cope with a significant and sudden
   health threat. The link between burden of disease, adverse factors in
   the social environment and poverty is well established and confirmed by
   the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO)'s Social Determinants of Health
   Commission report. Well-resourced nations generally consider that they
   have some humanitarian obligation to assist where possible, but this
   obligation is limited. The following questions are considered: Is
   reliance on the principle of beneficence to address the global
   disparities in the social determinants of health and life expectancy at
   birth good enough? Do well-resourced nations have some obligation from
   justice, which is stronger than from beneficence, and which cannot be as
   easily cast aside or diminished, to address these issues? In a
   globalised world, shaped by centuries of historical injustice and where
   first-world economies are now so intertwined and reliant on third-world
   labour, beneficence is not a strong enough principle on which to base an
   obligation to achieve the WHO vision of `health equity through action on
   the social determinants of health'.}},

Abstract = {{Aims and objectivesTo explore nurse perceptions of the feasibility of
   integrating the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale into practice within
   the inpatient palliative care setting.
   BackgroundDelirium occurs frequently in palliative care inpatient
   populations, yet is under-recognised. Exploring feasibility of delirium
   screening tools in this setting can provide insights into how
   recognition can be improved.
   DesignThis was a qualitative study using a focus group methodology.
   MethodFour semi-structured focus groups were conducted with 21 nurses
   working in two Australian palliative care units. Focus groups were
   digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic content analysis
   was used to analyse the data.
   ResultsThree major themes were identified: (1) Delirium screening using
   the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale is feasible, but then what? (2)
   Nuances, ambiguity and clinical complexity; and (3) Implementing
   structured processes requires firmer foundations. Themes describe how
   nurses perceived the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale to be an easy and
   brief screening tool which raised their awareness of delirium. They were
   largely willing to adopt it into practice, yet had uncertainty and
   misunderstandings of the tool specifically and delirium screening
   generally, application in a palliative care context, interventions for
   delirium and impact of screening on medical practice.
   ConclusionThe Nursing Delirium Screening Scale is feasible for use in a
   palliative care inpatient setting, but requires investigation of its
   psychometric properties before routine use in this patient population.
   Relevance to clinical practiceNurses require understanding of delirium,
   tailored guidance and a united approach with doctors to support their
   effective use of a delirium screening tool in the palliative care unit.
   Delirium practice change in this setting will also require nurses to
   become more active leaders and collaborators within their
   interdisciplinary teams.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work is to implement recently developed modeling
   approaches to predict the mechanical behavior of a
   precipitation-hardened Al-Mg-Si-Cu-Zn alloy. Assuming that precipitates
   act as weak or strong obstacles to dislocation motion, a yield strength
   model, originally introduced for AA6111 alloy, is used to derive the
   precipitate strengthening formulations. The application of the model
   provides accurate predictions for the evolution of yield strength of the
   alloy during artificial aging. The transition point, at which shearable
   precipitates become non-shearable ones, has been identified directly
   from the result of tensile tests of AA6011((m)) samples at different
   stages of artificial aging using work-hardening rate model. The
   linear/non-linear behavior of work-hardening rate of AA6011((m)) samples
   at different stages of artificial aging is also studied. It is explained
   that high dynamic recovery rate in presence of non-shearable
   precipitates causes the non-linear work-hardening behavior of massively
   overaged sample. The modeling results for underaged samples show better
   agreement with measured values of yield strength when the weak obstacle
   model has been implemented, while strong obstacle model shows relatively
   good agreement between the experimental and calculated results for the
   peak-aged and overaged samples. (C) The Minerals, Metals \& Materials

Abstract = {{Water quality degradation affects socio-economic development
   inappropriately and has dire effects on human health too. Water quality
   indexes (WQIs) are the methods widely used for modelling water quality
   status. However, using these indexes is limited by some constraints like
   deficiency of necessary database or uncertainty of decision-making.
   Throughout the ongoing research, fuzzy water quality indexes (FWQIs)
   were developed based on the Mamdani fuzzy inference system (FIS) to
   overcome the above-mentioned limitations. In other words, seven FWQIs
   models with different water quality parameters have been developed based
   on triangular and trapezoidal membership functions. Later, the developed
   indexes were employed to evaluate the water quality of 17 wells in Saveh
   Plain, Iran. Compared to the conventional WQI, the results showed that
   the elimination of some needed parameters in development of FWQI did not
   decrease the accuracy of water quality classification. However, omitting
   some other parameters with undesirable values made the classification of
   water quality unreliable. According to the results, some 35 \% of wells
   benefitted from proper drinking water quality, while approximately 30
   and 35 \% of them suffered from unsuitable and very poor drinking water
   quality, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{This article is devoted to an extension of boundary elements method
   (BEM) for solving elliptic partial differential equations of general
   type with constant coefficients. As the fundamental solution of these
   equations was not available in the literature, BEM was not able to
   handle them, directly. So the dual reciprocity method (DRM) has been
   applied to tackle these problems. In this work, a fundamental solution
   for these equations is obtained and a new formulation is derived to
   solve them. Besides, we show that the rate of convergence of the new
   scheme is quadratic when singular (boundary and domain) integrals are
   calculated, accurately. The new scheme is applicable on complex domains,
   without needing internal nodes, just same as conventional BEM. So the
   CPU time of the new scheme is much less than that of the DRM. Numerical
   examples presented in the article show ability and efficiency of the new
   scheme in solving two-dimensional nonhomogenous elliptic boundary value
   problems, clearly. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

   diverticulitis (CD) is the most common complication of caecal

   rare condition in the western world. The incidence of colonic
   diverticular disease can vary according to national origin, cultural

   it is an important situation because of its clinical similarity with the
   commonly seen acute right side abdominal diseases like acute
   appendicitis. Preoperative diagnosis is difficult, and hence, the actual
   frequency is not known. The treatment of CD can vary from medical
   therapy to right hemi colectomy. In this study, we presented ten CD
   cases on whom surgical resection was performed in our surgery unit
   during the last 8 years. Our purpose was to increase the awareness of

Abstract = {{In traditional visual secret sharing (VSS) schemes, every transparency
   has the same capability for recovery of the secret image. This means
   that managers are unable to assign an appropriate privilege to

   this study, we propose a novel secret sharing method, the
   privilege-based visual secret sharing model (PVSSM), which allows
   participants with different privileges. It is assumed that participants
   having a higher privilege will have a higher ability to recover the
   secret image. The proposed PVSSM has the following advantages: (1) Each
   share has an appropriate capability to reveal the secret information
   corresponding to the privilege of the share holder. (2) The restored
   image has a better contrast than the traditional VSS method can achieve.
   (3) The share has the same size as the secret image. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Morphometric MRI analysis enhances visualization of cortical tubers in
   tuberous sclerosis}},
Journal = {{EPILEPSY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{117}},
Pages = {{29-34}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Focal cortical dysplasias (FCD) type lib and cortical tubers in
   tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) are histopathologically similar and are
   both epileptogenic lesions frequently causing pharmacoresistant
   epilepsies. Morphometric analysis of T1- and T2-weighted MRI volume data
   sets can enhance visualization of FCD. Here, we retrospectively
   investigated whether morphometric MRI analysis is of equal benefit for
   visualizing cortical tubers.
   Materials and methods: Morphometric analysis was applied to TI- and
   partly also T2-weighted 1.5 T or 3 T MRI volume data sets of 15 TSC
   patients using a fully automated MATLAB (R) script (i.e. MAP07) commonly
   used for FCD detection. In this study, focus was on the most sensitive
   of the resulting morphometric feature maps (i.e. the `junction image')
   which highlights blurring of the gray-white matter junction in
   comparison to a normal database. The visualization of tubers in these
   `junction images' was quantitatively compared with that in conventional
   MR sequences.
   Results: In all patients, morphometric analysis visualized almost all
   tubers detected in the normal MRI, and additionally highlighted on
   average 23\% (range 3-50\%) more tubers which were not detected by
   visual analysis of the conventional MR sequences. When T2 volume data
   sets from a 3 T scanner were available for postprocessing, the rate of
   additionally detected tubers increased to 29\% on average. These
   formerly overlooked tubers were usually smaller than the tubers already
   found in the conventional MRI.
   Conclusion: Morphometric analysis of MRIs in TSC can highlight cortical
   tubers which are likely to be overlooked in conventional MRI sequences
   alone. Additionally detected tubers may be of potential importance for
   both presurgical evaluation and initial diagnosis of TSC. (C) 2015

Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{Background: Secondary aortoduodenal fistula (SADF) is a rare,
   life-threatening complication of abdominal aortic reconstruction.
   Clinical presentation varies and treatment requires complex surgical
   repair associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. This
   retrospective study examines the contemporary management of SADF at a
   tertiary vascular surgical practice.
   Methods: Thirteen patients were managed for SADF between 2004 and 2014.
   Vascular and duodenal reconstructions were considered. Primary end
   points included bile leak, major complications, and mortality.
   Results: Of the 13 patients presenting with SADF, 6 presented with
   luminal blood loss. During mean follow-up (632 days), the rate of major
   complication was 77\%. Overall, 38\% developed duodenal leak. All leaks
   occurred after graft explantation with extra-anatomic bypass, and the
   majority of these patients (80\%) had no preceding history of acute
   gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. There were no leaks identified after
   duodenal exclusion with gastrojejunostomy. Patients that developed
   duodenal leak had longer mean intensive care unit length of stay (LOS;
   7.0 vs. 2.3 days, P = 0.004), longer mean overall hospital LOS (36.6 vs.
   18.5 days, P = 0.012), and greater late mortality (40\% vs. 13\%). There
   were 2 SADF-related deaths. Overall mortality trended higher in females
   (67\% vs. 20\%, P = 0.125) and those that presented without acute GI
   bleed (43\% vs. 17\%, P = 0.308).
   Conclusions: Surgical reconstruction for SADF results in major
   morbidity. Those presenting with acute GI bleed trended toward better
   outcomes than those without. Duodenal leak remains a serious
   complication. Duodenal exclusion may represent a more appropriate and
   conservative approach for management of the duodenal defect in select
   patients.}},

Title = {{Reclaiming Lost Territory: the Response of Owyhee Harvester Ants to

Abstract = {{Neighboring colonies of the Owyhee harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex salinus,
   often share non-overlapping foraging boundaries in the areas between
   their nests. We found that interactions between neighbors along these
   foraging boundaries were infrequent but peaceful, and usually resulted
   in one or both individuals becoming agitated and scurrying away in
   opposite directions. Interactions between neighbors were necessary to
   maintain the foraging ranges of their respective colonies. An exclusion
   experiment showed that when one colony of a pair situated 5-7 m apart
   was denied access to its foraging range, individuals from the other
   colony would usually (i.e., in 7 out of 10 cases) enter the unoccupied
   space within 1 day. In 6 of 7 of those cases the occupiers set up
   foraging trails in the newly acquired area in 5 to 39 days (median = 13
   days). When foragers from the excluded colony were subsequently allowed
   access to their original foraging area, they reclaimed the entire area
   within 11 days but did not extend their advances beyond the original
   foraging boundaries. In contrast to the earlier encounters between
   neighbors, encounters during the reacquisition period were always
   aggressive, and in 14 of 57 encounters one or both of the individual
   combatants was killed. Non-lethal contests were shorter duration than
   lethal contests (19 +/- A 2 s versus 422 +/- A 65 s, respectively). Our
   results show that competition for foraging space in Owyhee harvester
   ants is intense despite the seemingly peaceful relationship between
   neighboring colonies prior to perturbation of their foraging boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{To examine the magnitude and speed of knee extensor torque production at
   the initiation of advanced anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)
   reconstruction rehabilitation and the associations with self-reported
   knee function.
   Twenty-eight subjects who were 12 weeks post-ACL reconstruction and 28
   age- and sex-matched physically active controls participated in this
   study. Knee extensor torque was assessed bilaterally with an isokinetic
   dynamometer at 60A degrees/s. The variables of interest were peak
   torque, average rate of torque development, time to peak torque and
   quadriceps symmetry index. Knee function was assessed with the
   International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form
   (IKDC-SKF).
   Peak torque and average rate of torque development were lower on the
   surgical side compared to the non-surgical side and controls. Quadriceps
   symmetry index was lower in subjects with ACL reconstruction compared to
   controls. On the surgical side, average rate of torque development was
   positively correlated with IKDC-SKF score (r = 0.379) while time to peak
   torque was negatively correlated with IKDC-SKF score (r = -0.407).
   At the initiation of advanced ACL reconstruction rehabilitation, the
   surgical side displayed deficits in peak torque and average rate of
   torque development. A higher rate of torque development and shorter time
   to peak torque were associated with better self-reported knee function.
   The results suggest that the rate of torque development should be
   addressed during advanced ACL reconstruction rehabilitation and faster
   knee extensor torque generation may lead to better knee function.

Abstract = {{Objective: To compare the oncologic outcomes and prognostic factors
   between metastatic upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) and UC of the
   bladder (UCB) after cisplatin-based chemotherapy.
   Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed patients with
   metastatic UTUC and UCB after
   methotrexate/vinblastine/doxorubicin/cisplatin (MVAC) or
   gemcitabine/cisplatin chemotherapy between 1997 and 2014 at Kaohsiung
   Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Progression-free survival (PFS) and
   overall survival (OS) were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.
   Univariate and multivariate analyses with Cox proportional hazard models
   were also performed to assess the effect of prognostic factors.
   Results: Totally, 203 patients were enrolled into our study, including
   120 patients with UTUC and 83 patients with UCB. For patients with UTUC,
   the median PFS was 7.3 months vs. 4.0 months (P < 0.001), and the median
   OS was 17.0 months vs. 10.5 months (P < 0.001) for MVAC and
   gemcitabine/cisplatin, respectively. For patients with UCB, the median
   PFS (P = 0.35) and OS (P = 0.06) of the 2 groups were insignificant. In
   multivariate analyses, number of metastatic sites was the identical
   prognostic factor for OS between UTUC (hazard ratio {[}HR] = 2.74; 95\%
   CI: 1.63-4.62; P < 0.001) and UCB (HR = 3.12; 95\% CI: 1.52-6.39; P =
   0.002). Presence of liver metastasis (HR = 1.84; 95\% CI: 1.05-123; P =
   0.03) and MVAC chemotherapy (HR = 0.54; 95\% CI: 0.35-0.83; P < 0.001)
   were significantly correlated to survival only for UTUC, not for UCB.
   Conclusion: Our study suggests discordant oncologic outcomes and
   prognostic factors between metastatic UTUC and UCB after cisplatin-based
   chemotherapy. A prospective study is warranted to validate our results.

Abstract = {{In this work, we leverage graphene's unique tunable Seebeck coefficient
   for the demonstration of a graphene-based thermal imaging system. By
   integrating graphene based photothermo-electric detectors with
   micromachined silicon nitride membranes, we are able to achieve room
   temperature responsivities on the order of similar to 7-9 V/W (at lambda
   = 10.6 mu m), with a time constant of similar to 23 ms. The large
   responsivities, due to the combination of thermal isolation and
   broadband infrared absorption from the underlying SiN membrane, have
   enabled detection as well as stand-off imaging of an incoherent
   blackbody target (300-500 K). By comparing the fundamental achievable
   performance of these graphene-based thermopiles with standard
   thermocouple materials, we extrapolate that graphene's high carrier
   mobility can enable improved performances with respect to two main
   figures of merit for infrared detectors: detectivity (>8 X 10(8) cm
   Hz(1/2)W(-1)) and noise equivalent temperature difference (<100 mK).
   Furthermore, even average graphene carrier mobility (<1000 cm(2) V-1
   s(-1)) is still sufficient to detect the emitted thermal radiation from
   a human target.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Gout is a deposition disease with an inflammatory response
   that can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Gout is stressful
   for affected individuals, and can cause erectile dysfunction (ED). The
   objective of this study was to identify the association between gout and
   psychogenic ED (PED) and organic ED (OED).
   Method: We analyzed 35,265 patients from the National Health Insurance
   Research Database who had been diagnosed with gout between 2000 and
   2011. A total of 70,529 matched controls were included in the study as a
   comparison. Patients with a history of PED and OED occurring before the
   index date, aged less than 20 years, orwith incomplete demographic
   informationwere excluded. Control patientswere selected fromthe
   population of people without a history of gout, PED, or OED. The
   following risk factors for PED and OEDwere included as covariates in
   themultivariable models: age, comorbidities of coronary artery disease
   (CAD), peripheral arterial disease, chronic kidney disease (CKD),
   hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, depression and anxiety.
   Result: Men with gout were more likely to have an increased risk (1.21
   times) of ED than were those without gout. Patients with gout were 1.52
   times more likely to develop OED and 1.18 times more likely to develop
   PED than patients in the control group. The risk of developing ED was
   greater for patients with comorbidities of CKD, diabetes,
   hyperlipidemia, depression and anxiety.
   Conclusion: Gout is associated with organic and psychogenic ED. Clinical
   physicians should consider this association when treating patients with
   gout. (C) 2015 European Federation of Internal Medicine. Published by

Title = {{Optically initialized robust valley-polarized holes in monolayer WSe2}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A robust valley polarization is a key prerequisite for exploiting valley
   pseudospin to carry information in next-generation electronics and
   optoelectronics. Although monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides
   with inherent spin-valley coupling offer a unique platform to develop
   such valleytronic devices, the anticipated long-lived valley pseudospin
   has not been observed yet. Here we demonstrate that robust
   valley-polarized holes in monolayer WSe2 can be initialized by optical
   pumping. Using time-resolved Kerr rotation spectroscopy, we observe a
   long-lived valley polarization for positive trion with a lifetime
   approaching 1 ns at low temperatures, which is much longer than the
   trion recombination lifetime (similar to 10-20 ps). The long-lived
   valley polarization arises from the transfer of valley pseudospin from
   photocarriers to resident holes in a specific valley. The optically
   initialized valley pseudospin of holes remains robust even at room
   temperature, which opens up the possibility to realize room-temperature
   valleytronics based on transition metal dichalcogenides.}},

Title = {{A new wind turbine fault diagnosis method based on ensemble intrinsic

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{83}},

Abstract = {{In this paper an ensemble intrinsic time-scale decomposition (EITD)
   method based on the cubic spline interpolation and linear transformation
   of intrinsic time-scale decomposition (ITD) was proposed, which can
   restrain the end effect and avoid the signal distortion. Combining
   ensemble intrinsic time-scale decomposition (EITD) with wavelet packet
   transform (WPT) and correlation dimension (CD), a novel method for
   decomposing nonstationary vibration signal and diagnosing wind turbine
   faults is presented. In implementation of the method, wavelet packet
   transform is employed to denoise raw vibration signals. Some important
   influencing factors relating directly to the computational precision of
   correlation dimension are discussed. The advantage of combining EITD and
   fractal dimension is that it does recognize the wind turbine gearbox
   fault types, and can solve the difficulty of recognizing fault
   conditions when two or more fractal dimensions are close to each other.
   To verify the effectiveness of the EITD-WPT-CD in detecting the faults,
   their induced vibrations are collected from high speed shaft gear under
   normal and faulty conditions through acceleration measurement. The
   results show that this method is capable of extracting the signal
   features and identifying the working conditions. The fault diagnosis
   application in a wind turbine gearbox indicates that the proposed method
   improved the accuracy of fault diagnosis. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Raman spectral changes of Artemisinin-induced Raji cells apoptosis}},
Journal = {{VIBRATIONAL SPECTROSCOPY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{83-89}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Though it has been reported that Artemisinin (ART), a traditional
   Chinese herb extract medicine, might inhibit the transferrin receptor of
   tumor cells to transfer iron and induce cell apoptosis, it remains
   controversial about the mechanism of ART-induced cell apoptosis. In this
   study, the single-cell Raman spectral data during ART-induced Raji cells
   apoptosis were acquired by Micro-Raman spectroscopy. Correspondingly,
   Raman spectral data during Dexamethasone (DEX)-induced Raji cells
   apoptosis were also presented. The obtained result revealed that peaks
   at 1303 and 1655 cm(-1) assigned to proteins and the peak at 785 cm(-1)
   assigned to the symmetric stretching vibration mode of O-P-O of DNA were
   changed in intensity in ART-treated cells relative to untreated cells.
   One possible reason was that ART played a role to inhibit the receptors
   generation of Rail cells during apoptosis. Moreover, by combining Raman
   spectral differences and principal component analysis (PCA), it was
   presented that the main biochemical changes of ART-induced cell
   apoptosis were come from the content and structure changes of proteins
   and nucleic acids, which were different from DEX-induced DNA changes,
   indicating that the mechanism of ART-induced cell apoptosis might be
   different with DEX-induced DNA damaging cell apoptosis. Importantly,
   these results also showed that PCA based Raman spectral analysis should
   be a better approach to exhibit the drugs-induced cell apoptosis.
   Moreover, this method will provide a useful tool to construct a
   biological model of cell apoptosis in vitro for the clinical treatment
   and anticancer drug research. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of TiO2 additives on microstructure and microwave dielectric
   properties of alpha-CaSiO3-2 wt\%Al2O3 ceramics have been investigated
   in detail. Specifically, the TiO2 addition results in the presence of
   two distinct phases, e.g. CaTiO3 and CaTiSiO5, which can inhibit the
   growth of alpha-CaSiO3 grains by surrounding their boundaries and also
   improve the bulk density of alpha-CaSiO3-2 wt\%Al2O3 ceramics. However,
   the TiO2 addition undermines the microwave dielectric properties of the
   title ceramics because the derived phases of CaTiO3 and CaTiSiO5 have
   poor quality factor. The tau(f) value is strongly correlated to the
   compositions and can be controlled through the compositional ratio. The
   alpha-CaSiO3-2 wt\% Al2O3 ceramics containing 2.5 wt\% of TiO2 sintered
   at 1250 degrees C showed excellent microwave dielectric properties

Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{999-1007}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A novel synthetic strategy has been developed for facile, green and
   low-cost fabrication of highly photoluminescent carbon dots (C-dots) by
   hydrothermal treatment of ethanol in aqueous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
   solution. Noticeably, the synthesized C-dots present an unexpectedly
   large quantum yield of 38.7\% without any post-treatments. In contrast
   to the most amorphous C-dots, the ethanol-derived C-dots possess an
   essentially crystalline nature as evidenced by the high-resolution
   transmission electron microscopy and selected-area electron diffraction.
   It is found that the C-dots can serve as multifunctional fluorescence
   nanosensors to detect pH, temperature, and the concentration of
   hypochlorite ion (ClO-). The PL intensity of C-dots decreases
   dramatically as pH increases from 3 to 11. Based on this feature, a
   C-dots coated fluorescent paper for visual detection of pH by naked eyes
   has been successfully prepared. The C-dots reveals a linear and
   reversible PL response toward the temperature in the range of 10-80
   degrees C, suggesting the great potential for design of
   temperature-sensitive devices. The selective quantification of ClO-
   concentration from 0.1 to 10 mu M with a detection limit as low as 0.08
   mu M is achieved by ClO--induced PL quenching of C-dots. Moreover, the
   C-dots applied for ClO- assay in real water samples with satisfactory
   recovery is demonstrated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Compared to LC resonance, LCL resonance has distinct advantages such as
   a large resonant capability, low voltage and current stresses of the
   power device, constant voltage or current output characteristics, and
   fault-tolerance capability. Thus, LCL resonant compensation is employed
   for a movable Inductive Contactless Power Transfer (ICPT) system with a
   multi-load in this paper, which achieves constant current output
   characteristics. Peculiarly, the primary side adopts a much larger
   compensation inductor than the primary leakage inductor to lower the
   reactive power, reduce the input current ripple, generate a large
   current in the primary side, and realize soft-switching. Furthermore,
   this paper proposes an approximate resonant point for large
   inductor-ratio LCL resonant compensation through fundamental wave
   analysis. In addition, the PWM control strategy is used for this system
   to achieve constant current output characteristics. Finally, an
   experimental platform is built, whose secondary E-Type coils can ride
   and move on a primary rail. Simulations and experiments are conducted to
   verify the effectiveness and accuracy of both the theory and the design
   method.}},

Abstract = {{The interfacial reactions of continuous SiC fiber reinforced Ti-6Al-4V
   matrix composite (SiCf/fi-6Al-4V composite) and continuous SiC fiber
   coated by C reinforced Ti-6Al-4V matrix composite (SiCf/C/Ti-6Al-4V
   composite) were investigated by using micro-beam electron diffraction
   (MBED) and energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS) on transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM). The sequence of the interfacial reactions in the
   as-processed and exposed at 900 degrees C for 50h SiCf/Ti-6Al-4V
   composites can be described as SiC parallel to TiC parallel to Ti5Si3 +
   TiC parallel to Ti-6Al-4V and SiC parallel to TiC parallel to Ti5Si3
   parallel to TiC parallel to Ti5Si3 parallel to TiC parallel to Ti5Si3
   parallel to Ti-6Al-4V, respectively. Additionally, both in as-processed
   and exposed composites, Ti3SiC2 and Ti3Si are absent at the interfaces.
   For the SiCf/C/Ti-6Al-4V composite exposed at 900 C for 50 h, the
   sequence of the interfacial reaction can be described as SiC parallel to
   C parallel to TiCF parallel to TiCC parallel to Ti-6Al-4V before C
   coating is completely consumed by interfacial reaction. When interfacial
   reaction consumes C coating completely, the sequence of the interfacial
   reaction can be described as SiC parallel to TiC parallel to Ti5Si3
   parallel to TiC parallel to Ti-6Al-4V. Furthermore, in SiCf/C/Ti-6Al-4V
   composite, C coating can absolutely prevent Si diffusion from SiC fiber
   to matrix. Basing on these results, the model of formation process of
   the interfacial reaction products in the composites was proposed. (C)

Abstract = {{Geotechnical centrifuge modeling, which can effectively simulate the
   stress field of soil in the prototype, was adopted to help investigate
   the effects of the uplifting of pipes buried at different depths within
   a medium dense sand under (1) a static state and (2) a dynamic state. To
   acquire the displacement vector fields and strain contours in the soil
   around pipes, particle image velocimetry technology was applied. The
   study focused on the deformation mechanisms of soil surrounding the
   pipes and ground surface. Two different deformation triggers, external
   forces and soil liquefaction, were considered. When uplifting was caused
   by an external force, the relationship between the soil deformation and
   uplift resistance was similar to the typical ground load-deformation
   characteristic relationships. There was little displacement of soil
   during the elastic stage. Along with the uplifting of the pipe, a
   plastic zone within the range of one pipe diameter (1D) above the pipe
   appeared in the soil at peak resistance. During the post-peak period, a
   shear failure plane extended upwards to the ground surface, at an
   inclined angle forming a trumpet-like shape. The ground surface
   deformation range expanded according to the buried depth of the pipe.
   Meanwhile, in a liquefied field, the soil flowed within a heart-shaped
   region around the pipe. The soil deformation region surrounding a
   shallow buried pipe, with a width of 5D-6D, was far larger than that
   found for a pipe buried at the same depth in a static field. Both heave
   and settlement could be observed on the ground surface.}},

Title = {{Direct construction of predictive models for describing growth of
   Salmonella Enteritidis in liquid eggs - A one-step approach}},
Journal = {{FOOD CONTROL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{57}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to develop a new approach using a
   one-step approach to directly construct predictive models for describing
   the growth of Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) in liquid egg white (LEW) and
   egg yolk (LEY). A five-strain cocktail of SE, induced to resist
   rifampicin at 100 mg/L, was used to inoculate LEW and LEY. Kinetic
   studies were conducted isothermally at different temperatures between 8
   and 43 degrees C to generate growth curves at each temperature.
   This study first solved an inverse problem globally, using the growth
   curves to estimate the temperature-dependent kinetic parameters, and
   then applied the parameters to predict growth (a forward problem). Once
   the growth curves were generated, they were assembled and analyzed using
   nonlinear regression to determine kinetic parameters of both primary and
   secondary models in one step, with an objective to minimize the global
   residual sum of squares (RSS) for the entire data set. For growth in
   LEW, a three-parameter logistic model was used. For growth in LEY, the
   Huang model was used as the primary model. The Ratkowsky square-root
   model was used to evaluate the growth rates.
   The results showed that the one-step approach resulted in accurate
   estimation of the kinetic parameters that were used later to
   successfully predict the growth of SE in LEY and LEW. The estimated
   nominal minimum growth temperatures of SE were 7.4 degrees C and 9.9
   degrees C, while the estimated maximum growth temperatures were 45.2
   degrees C and 46.8 degrees C, respectively, in LEW and LEY. As a
   validation, the predictive models were tested with independent growth
   curves of SE in LEY and LEW at 37 degrees C. The root mean square error
   (RMSE) was only 0.36 and 0.28 log CFU/ml over a total scale of 8.4 and
   7.8 log CFU/ml, respectively, for the growth models of SE in LEY and
   LEW, suggesting that the one-step approach can generate accurate models
   for predicting the growth of SE in LEY and LEW. The results from this
   study can be used to predict the growth of SE and evaluate the safety of
   LEY and LEW. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Prostate cancer (PCa) remains the second leading cause of cancer

   the diagnostic value of resistive index (RI) measurement using color
   Doppler ultrasound in patients with PCa. Electronic literature databases
   were exhaustively searched for relevant studies published prior to May
   31, 2014. Nine studies met our predetermined inclusion criteria for the
   present meta -analysis. The methodologic quality of the selected studies
   was independently assessed by 2 reviewers based on Quality Assessment of
   Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool. Our meta -analysis results showed that
   RI values were significantly higher in malignant prostate tissues
   compared to normal prostate tissues (standardized mean difference
   {[}SMD] 0.42, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] 0.12-0.73, p = 0.007) and
   benign prostate tissues (SMD 0.41, 95\% CI 0.26-0.56, p<0.001). Subgroup
   analysis based on the diagnostic instruments used revealed that RI
   values were accurate in diagnosis of PCa when compared between malignant
   tissue vs normal tissue and malignant tissue vs benign tissue (all
   p<0.05). Taken together, our findings support the potential clinical
   applications of RI values in diagnosis of PCa.}},

Abstract = {{The water-gas shift (WGS) reaction is an important process for the
   production of H-2 either for industrial use as, e.g., an ammonia
   precursor or to produce low-CO concentration H-2 gas streams for use in
   fuel cells. Hybrid metal/metal oxide catalysts have permitted
   low-temperature WGS reaction by promoting associative reaction
   mechanisms in which -OH groups adsorbed at the metal oxide surface
   combine with reactant CO to form metastable intermediates. Here we show
   that sufficiently small, hydroxylated ceria nanopartides (CNPs) can
   directly catalyze the WGS reaction without requiring the presence of a
   metal cocatalyst. Hydroxyl groups intrinsically present at the surfaces
   of such CNPs allow associative mechanisms with activation barriers on
   the order of 0.5 eV, low enough to allow metal-free low-temperature
   catalysis of the WGS reaction.}},

Abstract = {{With Nb-Ti-stabilized 430 ferritic stainless steel (NTS430FSS) and SUS
   430 ferritic stainless steel (SUS430FSS) as experimental materials, the
   influence of precipitation on intergranular corrosion resistance was
   investigated. A series of aging treatment were carried out. The
   free-exposure corrosion test and double loop electrochemical
   potentiokinetic reactivation (DL-EPR) test with a scan rate of 1.67 mV/s
   at 26 degrees C were applied to evaluate the intergranular corrosion
   (IGC) resistance. Metallographic observation, scanning electron
   microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM) with energy
   dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis were
   conducted. The results show that IGC occurred in SUS430FSS aged above
   700 degrees C, while it occurred in NTS430FSS as the temperature was
   improved to 1 050 degrees C. The critical degree of sensitization
   I-r/I-a reaches 0.305 in SUS430FSS, which is higher than that of
   NTS430FSS, i.e. 0.010, aged at 950 degrees C for 2 h. The TEM, EDS and
   XRD results show that a large amount of Cr23C6 precipitates with size of
   60 nmx22 nm are located at the SUS430FSS grain boundaries as chains.
   With the addition of Nb and Ti and reduction of C, the amount of
   precipitates reduces significantly in NTS430FSS. A majority of Cr23C6
   were replaced by TiC and NbC. Only a small amount of spherical TiC
   (R=186 nm) and square TiN (312 nmx192 nm) with Nb and Cr adsorbed are
   left along grain boundaries. Due to the dual stabilization of Nb and Ti,
   the precipitation of Cr23C6 is restrained, the chromium depleted region
   is avoided and accordingly the resistance to the intergranular corrosion
   is improved.}},

Abstract = {{Suprachoroidal hemorrhage is a rare complication of all types of
   intraocular surgery and is always associated with poor visual outcome or
   even eye enucleation. Better understanding of SCH during various types
   of intraocular surgery can help surgeons to avoid this devastating
   complication and to optimally treat patients. We encountered three cases
   of SCH in vitrectomized eyes and found that there were some common
   characteristics compared to SCH developed in other intraocular
   surgeries. We hypothesized that SCH in vitrectomized eye might be
   localized, not severe and ended up comparably good without surgical
   intervention. Then we analyzed the risk factors and incidence,
   characteristics and severity, management and prognosis of SCH in
   vitrectomized eye to evaluate the hypothesis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Characterisation of the role of an alkaline protease from Vibrio midae
   SY9 in enhancing the growth rate of cultured abalone fed a
   probiotic-supplemented feed}},
Journal = {{AQUACULTURE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{448}},

Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{South Africa has a rapidly developing abalone aquaculture industry based
   largely on the cultivation of Haliotis midae. The prophylactic use of
   probiotic microorganisms has been shown to enhance the health, growth
   and nutritional status of a variety of cultured aquaculture species.
   Furthermore, research has shown that H. midae fed a high protein
   artificial diet supplemented with the proteolytic marine bacterium
   Vibrio midae SY9 have enhanced digestive protease activity levels,
   protein digestion and absorption, and growth. The predominant V. midae
   SY9 extracellular alkaline protease, VmproA, has been previously shown
   to be present in the crop/stomach and intestinal regions of H. midae fed
   a diet supplemented with V. midae SY9. Therefore, VmproA may be
   responsible for the probiotic properties of the bacterium in farmed
   abalone. In this study, the role of VmproA on abalone growth was
   investigated using the mutant strain V. midae SY9Mut2, which is unable
   to produce VmproA. Over the course of a 180 day laboratory-based growth
   trial the growth rate of small ( 28 mm) abalone improved by 6.5 and
   14.5\% following dietary supplementation with V. midae SY9 and V. midae
   SY9Mut2, respectively, in comparison to abalone fed a basal diet. In
   situ protease activity within the H. midae digestive tract was
   significantly increased in animals fed the V. midae SY9 supplemented
   diet compared to abalone fed either the basal feed or the V. midae
   SY9Mut2 supplemented diet. Thus, VmproA does not appear to be the factor
   responsible for increased growth of probiotic-supplemented abalone.
   Statement of relevance: The manuscript addresses the mechanism of how
   probiotics function in a farmed abalone species. This is important since
   probiotic supplementation of feed is proving successful in increasing
   the growth of these molluscs, and yet very little is known regarding the
   underlying relationship between the host animal and the probiont. (C)

Abstract = {{PURPOSE Although case management (CM) is increasingly being implemented
   to address the complex needs of vulnerable clienteles, few studies have
   examined the patient experience of CM. This study aimed to examine the
   experience of patients and their family members with care integration as
   part of a primary care CM intervention. Patients in the study were
   frequent users of health care services who had chronic diseases.
   METHODS A descriptive, qualitative approach was conducted involving 25
   patients and 8 of their family members. Data were collected through
   in-depth interviews of the patients and 2 focus groups of family members
   and were analyzed thematically.
   RESULTS While some participants did not fully understand the CM
   intervention and a few believed that it involved too many appointments,
   the CM nurses were patients' preferred contact with primary care. The
   nurses actively involved the patients in developing and carrying out
   their individualized services plans (ISPs) with other health care
   partners. Patients felt that their needs were taken into consideration,
   especially regarding access to the health care system. The case manager
   facilitated access to information as well as communication and
   coordination among health care and community partners. This improved
   communication comforted the patients and nurtured a relationship of
   trust. Participants were actively involved in decision-making. Their
   ISPs helped them know where they were going and improved transitions
   between services.
   CONCLUSIONS The experience of patients and family members was overall
   very positive regarding care integration. They reported improved access,
   communication, coordination, and involvement in decision-making as well
   as better health care transitions.}},

Abstract = {{Reggies/flotillins are implicated in trafficking of membrane proteins to
   their target sites and in the regulation of the Rab11a-dependent
   targeted recycling of E-cadherin to adherens junctions (AJs). Here we
   demonstrate a function of reggies in focal adhesion (FA) formation and
   alpha 5- and beta 1-integrin recycling to FAs. Downregulation of
   reggie-1 in HeLa and A431 cells by siRNA and shRNA increased the number
   of FAs, impaired their distribution and modified FA turnover. This was
   coupled to enhanced focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Rac1 signaling and
   gain in plasma membrane motility. Wild type and constitutively-active
   (CA) Rab11a rescued the phenotype (normal number of FAs) whereas
   dominant-negative (DN) Rab11a mimicked the loss-of-reggie phenotype in
   control cells. That reggie-1 affects integrin trafficking emerged from
   the faster loss of internalized antibody-labeled beta 1-integrin in
   reggie-deficient cells. Moreover, live imaging using TIRF microscopy
   revealed vesicles containing reggie-1 and alpha 5- or beta 1-integrin,
   trafficking close to the substrate near membrane and making kiss-and-run
   contacts with FAs. Thus, reggie-1 in interaction with Rab11a controls
   Rac1 and FAK activation and coordinates the targeted recycling of alpha
   5- and beta 1-integrins to FAs to regulate FA formation and membrane
   dynamics. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Collections of images and 3D models hide in them many interesting
   aspects of our surroundings. Significant efforts have been devoted to
   organize and explore such data repositories. Most such efforts, however,
   process the two data modalities separately, and do not take full
   advantage of the complementary information that exist in different
   domains, which can help to solve difficult problems in one by exploiting
   the structure in the other. Beyond the obvious difference in data
   representations, a key difficulty in such joint analysis lies in the
   significant variability in the structure and inherent properties of the
   2D and 3D data collections, which hinders cross-domain analysis and
   exploration. We introduce CROSSLINK, a system for joint image-3D model
   processing that uses the complementary strengths of each data modality
   to facilitate analysis and exploration. We first show how our system
   significantly improves the quality of text-based 3D model search by
   using side information coming from an image database. We then
   demonstrate how to consistently align the filtered 3D model collections,
   and then use them to re-sort image collections based on pose and shape
   attributes. We evaluate our framework both quantitatively and
   qualitatively on 20 object categories of 2D image and 3D model
   collections, and quantitatively demonstrate how a wide variety of tasks
   in each data modality can strongly benefit from the complementary
   information present in the other, paving the way to a richer 2D and 3D
   processing toolbox.}},

Abstract = {{Malrotation is a cause of persistent pain and poor functioning
   postoperatively in those who undergo a total knee replacement (TKR). The
   accurate measurement of malrotation is not routinely available in most
   hospital settings due to an absence of three-dimensional computed
   tomography (CT) software. An accessible, uncomplicated technique to
   demonstrate TKR prosthesis malrotation would be of benefit to
   orthopaedic surgeons worldwide. A patient was reviewed with persistent
   postoperative pain, having undergone a right TKR 3 years previously for
   progressive osteoarthritis. Postoperative prosthetic infection,
   instability, loosening, and fracture were ruled out as causes for the
   persistent pain. A two-dimensional CT scan was obtained of the patient's
   affected right knee. Adhesive pieces of paper (Post-it notes) were used
   to highlight the posterior tibial prosthesis axis, the tibial tuberosity
   axis, the posterior condylar axis of the femoral prosthesis and the
   femoral surgical transepicondylar axis, as per the technique described
   by Berger et al. A protractor was used to assess the degree of
   malrotation of the tibial and femoral prostheses. Allowing for human
   error and that of parallax, an immediate assessment was made of the
   patient's prosthesis using a readily available imaging modality, and
   malrotation was quickly identified using accessible, affordable everyday
   stationary equipment.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This article explores the idea of Howard S. Becker as organisational
   theorist. It examines some of the principal conceptual imagery in
   Becker's work and considers the significance of this imagery for how
   organisations are seen' (conceptualised) and looked at' (analysed). To
   this end, a critical comparison of Becker's concept of world and
   Bourdieu's concept of field is undertaken. By his own admission, Becker
   recognises that some of his key studiesof art worlds, jazz musicians,
   educational environments and so forthmight be recast as centrally about
   organisations'. However, it is argued that Becker is something of an
   unwilling' organisational theorist; not in the sense that he avoids or
   is ignorant of the conceptual debates invoked by that term, but in as
   much as formal theory without object is profoundly at odds with key
   aspects of his sociological practice. Accordingly, this article
   centrally considers how Becker has consistently looked elsewhere' in
   much of his work. Looking elsewhere', it is proposed, involves reframing
   key conceptual and methodological problems such that they are amenable
   to research. It also involves an often radical rejection of the framing
   of certain kinds of problem, points towards alternative modes of
   analysis and investigation and entails the development of conceptual
   imagery expressly intended to avoid the restrictions and confinement of
   now dominant forms of analytical convention.}},

Abstract = {{Spanish speaking populations in the USA have long been categorised under
   the umbrella term `Hispanic', which is a cultural construct. The term
   Hispanic ignores the unique ethnohistories and biological variation
   among Hispanic groups with various European, African and
   indigenousAmerican influences. Considerable heterogeneity has been
   identified in pre-contact America and has continued to influence the
   cultural and biological compositions of various regions today. The
   purpose of this research is to examine biological variation in Mexico,
   which was influenced by indigenous migration patterns and the Old World
   conquests of the Americans. Usingmultivariate statistics, this paper
   compares 16 three-dimensional craniometric landmarks of samples from
   northern Central Mexico, northern Yucatan and western Mexico to examine
   the regional biological variation present in Mexico in both prehistoric
   and historic groups and also compares Mexican, Spanish and African
   American groups to examine patterns ofOld World conquests. Multivariate
   statistics detected significant group differences for both size and
   shape (centroid size, p < 0.0001; shape, p < 0.0001) and showed that
   while significantly different, all the Mexican groups are more similar
   to one another except for one prehistoric inland-western Mexican group,
   which ismorphologically distinct from the other Mexican groups. Previous
   mtDNA research in these areas shows a low prevalence of African American
   admixture and a high indigenous component in the northern Mexican
   groups, which is consistent with the findings of this paper. The
   prehistoric and historic Mexican groups were themost similar indicating
   the retention of indigenous admixture after contact. The results from
   this analysis demonstrate that all groups are significantly different
   fromone another supporting other findings that have shown that the
   indigenous populations of the NewWorld are heterogeneous and that this
   variationmay also contribute to the heterogeneity of contemporary
   populations. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In response to the rapid growth of information in recent decades,
   knowledge-based systems have become an essential tool for organizational
   learning. The application of electronic performance-support systems in
   learning activities has attracted considerable attention from
   researchers. Nevertheless, the vast, ever-increasing amount of
   information is creating management problems regarding the efficiency and
   accuracy of knowledge retrieval. This study aims to develop a dynamic
   inference expert system (DIES) to solve these problems. DIES integrates
   web technology, knowledge management, Extensible Markup Language (XML)
   and C Language Integrated Production System (CLIPS) to facilitate the
   convenience of knowledge retrieval and the efficiency of learning at
   work. The advantages of XML include scalability, sharing, easy
   readability and the ability to enhance the efficient management of
   knowledge-based systems. In DIES, organizational knowledge is
   automatically generated as machine-readable language and knowledge
   description, using CLIPS as a rule-conduction tool to develop specific
   organizational knowledge bases. A data source consisting of 22
   participants from different industries was employed to examine the
   effectiveness of DIES. Results indicate that participants intend to
   apply DIES within their industries, with a 95\% probability of attaining
   above-average satisfaction.}},

Abstract = {{To understand and predict the response of explosive materials, numerical
   models are utilized to simulate various scenarios. Various hazard and
   vulnerability scenarios for explosives involve multiple shock
   compression. In the present study, a kind of mesoscopic model for shock
   ignition of solid heterogeneous explosives is examined in order to
   demonstrate its availability to account for the desensitization caused
   by multiple shocks in explosives. Since the mesoscopic model is based on
   the assumption of the elastic viscoplastic pore collapse mechanism, and
   on the other hand the desensitization mechanism is also usually
   described in connection with the closure of pores, the ability of the
   mesoscopic model to predict the desensitization effects must be
   analyzed. For this purpose, the mesoscopic model has been implemented in
   a hydrodynamic code (LS-DYNA) as a user-defined equation of state. For
   verification, the double shock, reflected shock and detonation-quenching
   experiments have been modeled and simulated. The data show that the
   model can reproduce various features of some of the previously reported
   experiments involving the preshock desensitization of solid explosives.}},

Abstract = {{People often view their sociopolitical systems as fair and natural
   despite indisputable biases in their structure. Current theories of this
   phenomenon trace its roots to a motivation to alleviate anxiety and
   uncertainty. Here, we propose a complementary cognitive pathway for
   these system-endorsing attitudes. Specifically, we propose that the
   fundamental mechanisms through which people explain the world around
   them may also be a source of such attitudes. These explanatory processes
   are inadvertently biased to yield inherent or internal facts as
   explanations for a wide variety of social and natural phenomena,
   including sociopolitical patterns (e.g., Why are some people rich?
   Because they are really smart). In turn, this bias toward inherent
   attributions makes it seem that the observations being explained (such
   as the societal status quo) are legitimate and thus worthy of support.
   Four studies with participants as young as 4 years of age provided
   correlational and experimental evidence for the hypothesized link
   between explanatory processes and support for the status quo. These
   findings suggest that the tendency to endorse existing sociopolitical
   arrangements emerges partly on a foundation laid early in life by a
   basic component of human cognition.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial gas lift technology is widely used in oil production to
   sustain oil flow from the well to the surface when reservoir pressure
   drops. Dynamic model that describes artificial gas lift system is highly
   nonlinear, which makes the controller design for this system not an easy
   task. A dynamic model of this system is further detailed with respect to
   the models available in the literature to account for the depth of the
   well. Two approaches to controller design are implemented: the first one
   is based on the local linearization in a number of operating
   (equilibrium) points that are characterized by different gas flow set
   points; the other approach is based on the use of the modified relay
   feedback test (MRFT) applied incrementally in different operating
   points. In both approaches, the controller is designed as a
   gain-scheduled PI controller. (C) 2015 The Franklin Institute. Published

Abstract = {{Radio resource allocation in WiMAX is the major functionality of radio
   resource management (RRM) to support the Quality of Service (QoS) based
   on radio transmission characteristics in wireless communication systems.
   To allocate the slots seemly is an important issue and is regarded as
   Binary Integer Programming (BIP) problem that is one of NP-hard
   problems. This paper proposes a novel dynamic ant colony slot assignment
   (DACSA) algorithm including construct solution, local search, pheromone
   update and termination. Our algorithm achieves highly efficient resource
   utilization and fairness on the basis of specific channel conditions
   while guaranteeing the QoS requirements. Additionally, we propose two
   schemes for DACSA algorithm in the construct solution phase, namely
   Schemel and Scheme2. The Schemel is the original scheme, that is, the
   scheme that DACSA allocates slots to the RT-VR MSs based on proportional
   fairness indexes until the bandwidth requirements are satisfied. In the
   Scheme2, the DACSA only allocates portion of remaining slots to RT-VR
   MSs at the step 2 of construct solution when minimum QoS requirement is
   met. Therefore, the system throughput can be improved if some slots with
   bad channel condition for the MS are allocated to other MSs to get
   better capacity. The proposed DACSA algorithm is compared with PA
   (proportional allocation) and RCS (rate-guaranteed competitive
   scheduling) in terms of the packet delay, jitter, dropping rate,
   throughput, waste rate and fairness.}},

Abstract = {{Arctic zooplankton ascend to shallow depths during spring to graze on
   the yearly occurring phytoplankton bloom. However, in surface waters
   they are exposed to detrimental ultraviolet radiation (UVR) levels.
   Here, we quantified concentrations of substances known to have
   UVR-protective functions, namely mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) and
   the carotenoid astaxanthin, from March to May in Calanus finmarchicus,
   Calanus glacialis and Calanus hyperboreus. Ice cover was 100\% in the
   beginning of March, started to break up during April and was gone by the
   end of May. UVR-exposure in the water column was tightly linked to the
   ice conditions and water UVR-transparency was up to 6 m (depth where 1\%
   radiation remains). Concentrations of MAAs in C. finmarchicus and C.
   glacialis increased sharply during ice break-up and peaked concurrently
   with maximum chlorophyll a (Chl a) levels. MAA-concentrations in C.
   hyperboreus increased later in accordance with its later arrival to the
   surface. The concentration of astaxanthin increased in all three species
   over time but there was no synchrony with ice conditions or the
   phytoplankton bloom. Even though only the upper 6 m of the water column
   was affected by UV-radiation, MAAs in the copepods were tightly
   correlated to the UV-threat. Hence, changes in ice cover are projected
   to have a large impact on the UVR-exposure of zooplankton emphasizing
   the importance of the timing of zooplankton ascent from deep waters in
   relation to the phytoplankton bloom and the ice break-up.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, we have reported a systematic comparison of molecular
   preparation protocols (using MOE or Maestro) in combination with two
   docking tools (GOLD or Glide), employing our DEKOIS 2.0 benchmark sets.
   Herein, we demonstrate how comparable settings of data preparation
   protocols can affect the profile and AUG of pROC curves based on
   variations in chemotype enrichment. We show how the recognition of
   different classes of chemotypes can affect the docking performance,
   particularly in the early enrichment, and monitor changes in this
   recognition behavior based on score normalization and rescoring
   strategies. For this, we have developed ``pROC-Chemotype{''}, which is
   an automated protocol that matches and visualizes ligand chemotype
   information together with potency classes in the pROC profiles obtained
   by docking. This tool enhances the understanding of the influence of
   chemotype recognition in early enrichment, but also reveals trends of
   impaired recognition of chemotype classes at the end of the
   score-ordered rank. Identifying such issues helps to devise
   score-normalization strategies to overcome this potential bias in an
   intuitive manner. Furthermore, strong perturbations in chemotype ranking
   between different methods can help to identify the underlying reasons
   (e.g., changes in the protonation/tautomerization state). It also
   assists in the selection of appropriate scoring functions that are
   capable to retrieve more potent and diverse hits. In summary, we
   demonstrate how this new tool can be utilized to identify and highlight
   chemotype-specific behavior, e.g., in dataset preparation. This can help
   to overcome some chemistry-related bias in virtual screening campaigns.

   using the sodium starch glycolate, crosscarmellose sodium for IR layer.
   Eudragit L100, pectin, acacia as sustained release polymers in different
   ratios for SR metoprolol tartrate layer and sodium bicarbonate, citric
   acid as gas generating agents for the floating extended release layer.
   The floating bilayer tablets of lisinopril maleate and metoprolol
   tartrate were designed to overcome the various problems associated with
   conventional oral dosage form. Floating tablets were evaluated for
   floating lag time, drug contents and in-vitro dissolution profile and
   different kinetic release models were applied. It was clear that the
   different ratios of polymers affected the drug release and floating
   time. L2 and M4 showed good drug release profile and floating behavior.
   The linear regression and model fitting showed that all formulation
   followed Higuchi model of drug release model except M4 that followed
   zero order kinetic. From the study it is evident that a promising
   controlled release by floating bilyer tablets of lisinopril maleate and

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: This study was designed to investigate the diagnostic
   efficacy of computed tomography (CT) for the detection diaphragmatic
   injury in cases undergoing diagnostic and therapeutic laparoscopy in
   left thoracoabdominal penetrating injuries.
   METHODS: Demographic properties, stabbed body region, additional
   injuries, hemodynamic parameters, time to admission, diagnostic
   examinations, and type of treatment were retrospectively reviewed in one
   hundred and eight patients presenting with left thoracoabdominal injury
   after penetrating sharp object injury between April 2010 and December
   2014. Preoperative CT scans of all patients were reviewed blind to the
   results of surgical evaluation. The relationship between diaphragmatic
   injury and hemothorax, pneumothorax, abdominal free fluid, and solid
   organ injuries were analyzed. All patients underwent physical
   examination, complete blood count monitoring, and hemodynamic assessment
   prior to surgery.
   RESULTS: The most common finding on physical examination was anterior
   left thoracoabdominal injury. The injury was detected surgically in 36\%
   of twenty-five cases with lateral injury. Diaphragmatic injury was
   present in twenty-five (23.1\%) of all cases, all of whom were treated
   with laparoscopic repair. An analysis of all CT findings in relation to
   surgical results revealed that CT had a sensitivity of 80\%, a
   specificity of 95\%, a PPV of 83\%, and a NPV of 94\% for the detection
   of diaphragmatic injuries. Mean duration of hospital stay was 5.4 days
   (range, 1-16 days) in the entire study population.
   CONCLUSION: CT is still associated with diagnostic challenges in
   penetrating diaphragmatic injuries. Nevertheless, CT showed a high
   specificity and a negative predictive value in our study. Detection of a
   diaphragmatic defect and fatty tissue herniation makes the definitive
   diagnosis of diaphragmatic injury in penetrating thoracoabdominal
   injuries. Prospective studies with a larger sample size are necessary to
   further clarify the role of CT in detection of diaphragmatic injuries in
   thoracoabdominal sharp penetrating object injuries.}},

Abstract = {{We determined the prevalence of osteosarcopenic obesity (loss of bone
   and muscle coexistent with increased adiposity) in overweight/obese
   postmenopausal women and compared their functionality to obese-only
   women. Results showed that osteosarcopenic obese women were outperformed
   by obese-only women in handgrip strength and walking/balance abilities
   indicating their higher risk for mobility impairments.
   Introduction Osteosarcopenic obesity (OSO) is a recently defined triad
   of osteopenia/osteoporosis, sarcopenia, and adiposity. We identified
   women with OSO in overweight/obese postmenopausal women and evaluated
   their functionality comparing them with obese-only (OB) women.
   Additionally, women with osteopenic/osteoporotic obesity (OO), but no
   sarcopenia, and those with sarcopenic obesity (SO), but no
   osteopenia/osteoporosis, were identified and compared. We hypothesized
   that OSO women will have the lowest scores for each of the functionality
   measures.
   Methods Participants (n = 258; \% body fat a parts per thousand yen35)
   were assessed using a Lunar iDXA instrument for bone and body
   composition. Sarcopenia was determined from negative residuals of linear
   regression modeled on appendicular lean mass, height, and body fat,
   using 20th percentile as a cutoff. Participants with T-scores of L-1-L-4
   vertebrae and/or total femur <-1, but without sarcopenia, were
   identified as OO (n = 99) and those with normal T-scores, but with
   sarcopenia, as SO (n = 28). OSO (n = 32) included women with both
   osteopenia/osteoporosis and sarcopenia, while those with normal bone and
   no sarcopenia were classified as OB (n = 99). Functionality measures
   such as handgrip strength, normal/brisk walking speed, and right/left
   leg stance were evaluated and compared among groups.
   Results Women with OSO presented with the lowest handgrip scores,
   slowest normal and brisk walking speed, and shortest time for each leg
   stance, but these results were statistically significantly different
   only from the OB group.
   Conclusion These findings indicate a poorer functionality in women
   presenting with OSO, particularly compared to OB women, increasing the
   risk for bone fractures and immobility from the combined decline in bone
   and muscle mass, and increased fat mass.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents the first systematic study on the synthesis of
   nitrogen-rich nanoporous activated carbons by chitosan carbonization in
   the presence of a hard template (activator), i.e. Na2CO3. Carbonization
   process was carried out in the range of 600-900 degrees C under a flow
   of nitrogen. The effect of the addition of different volumes of
   activator and the temperature of carbonization on the development of
   specific surface area and pore structure (pore volume and median pore
   diameter) of the activated carbons was investigated. Additionally, the
   nitrogen content and nitrogen-containing surface species were determined
   by means of XPS and combustion elemental analysis. The nitrogen content
   was placed in the range of 2.4-13.1 wt.\%. On the grounds of the
   low-temperature adsorption of nitrogen, it was found that obtained
   adsorption isotherms were of type-I, based on the IUPAC classification,
   which is typical for microporous materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Objectives:The aim of the study was to identify predictive factors of
   failure of 2-stage hepatectomy (TSH) forthe selection of patients with
   extensive bilobar colorectal liver metastases (CRLM), who are candidates
   for TSH.Background:The main weakness of TSH is the risk of failure to
   complete both the sequential procedures.Methods:Between 2000 and 2012,
   from a total cohort of 845 patients resected for CRLM, 125 patients
   (14.8\%) with extensive CRLM were planned for TSH. All factors related
   to the failure of TSH were analyzed, and a predictive model was built
   utilizing the independent predictive factors of
   failure.Results:Forty-four patients (35.2\%) could not proceed to the
   second stage, and their overall survival (OS) was significantly worse
   than that of those who completed the TSH (5-year OS: 0\% vs 44.2\%;
   P<0.0001). Multivariate analysis revealed that carcinoembryonic antigen
   >30ng/mL {[}relative risk (RR) 2.73, P=0.03], tumor size >40mm (RR 2.89,
   P=0.04), chemotherapy cycles >12 (RR 3.46, P=0.01), and tumor
   progression during first-line chemotherapy (RR 6.56, P=0.01) were
   independent predictive factors of failure. For patients not presenting
   any factors, the probability of failure was 10.5\%, with a 5-year OS
   rate of 41.9\%. The addition of each subsequent factor increased the
   risk to 43.5\%, 72.7\%, 88.5\%, and 95.5\%, and decreased the 5-year OS
   to 38.8\%, 29.2\%, 0\%, and 0\%, respectively, for 1, 2, 3, and 4
   factors.Conclusions:TSH should not be recommended in patients with more
   than 2 risk factors. Avoidance of these factors significantly reduces
   the risk of failure and is crucial for long-term survival.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{In low-temperature combustion concepts such as partially premixed
   combustion, the ignition delay should be large enough in order to ensure
   sufficient fuel and air mixing before the start of combustion. It is
   also necessary that the combustion timing is sufficiently well phased
   for high thermal efficiency.
   Since the ignition delay and combustion timing are intimately coupled,
   the decoupling of these two quantities gives rise to an interesting
   multiple input, multiple output control problem where the control of the
   air system and the fuel injection system have to be combined. In a
   multi-cylinder engine this problem becomes underdetermined or
   uncontrollable with more outputs than inputs.
   This article investigates model-based cycle-to-cycle cylinder-individual
   closed-loop control of the ignition delay and the combustion phasing in
   a multi-cylinder heavy-duty DI engine running on a gasoline fuel
   mixture. The controller design of choice was model predictive control
   (MPC) which is a suitable design for multiple input/output systems with
   actuator constraints. Ignition delay and combustion phasing were
   extracted from cooled in-cylinder pressure sensors and controlled by
   manipulating injection timings, the gas mixture temperature and
   exhaust-gas recirculation (EGR) ratio using a dual EGR-path system and a
   fast thermal-management (FTM) system.}},

Abstract = {{Emissions of gaseous and particulate pollutants from burning of wheat
   straw, rice straw, cotton straw, and bagasse were studied for the two
   agricultural-activity-dominated provinces of Pakistan: the Punjab and
   Sindh. Emission estimates, inventory, and allocation maps indicated
   distinct patterns of pollutant emissions in the two provinces.
   Comparative pollutant emission analysis revealed that the Punjab
   province produced higher pollutants from agricultural biomass burning
   than Sindh province. Total emissions from these two provinces were
   estimated to be 16,084.04 Gg (16.08 Tg) for the year 2006/2007. Wheat
   straw was found to be the dominant source of CO, CO2, SO2, NOx, and EC
   emissions in the both provinces. However, for the emissions of CH4, NH3,
   EC, and OC, the Punjab and Sindh provinces differed markedly for the
   crop residue share in these pollutant emissions. Rice straw was found to
   be the largest contributor of CH4 (51 \%) and NH3 (65 \%) in Sindh
   province. When total emissions from biomass burning were considered at
   provincial level, wheat straw and bagasse were the major crop residues
   which accounted for 72 and 14 \% of pollutant emissions, respectively,
   in the Punjab province, whereas, in Sindh province, the order of crop
   residue contribution in total emission was as follows: wheat (59 \%) >
   bagasse (19 \%) > rice (14 \%) > cotton (7 \%). Emission inventory data
   of total pollutants per unit area under cultivation (Mg ha(-1)) revealed
   that Sindh province produced higher emissions per hectare for wheat
   straw, rice straw, and bagasse than the Punjab province.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of partial substitution of cement particles with nanoclay on
   the expansive potential of cement mortar due to alkali-silica reaction
   (ASR) was investigated. Portland cement was replaced by 0.5\%, 1\%, and
   2\% montmorillonite nanoclay. The effect of ASR on compressive strength,
   chemical composition, and microstructure of nanoclay-cement composites
   was evaluated. The accelerated mortar-bar method was followed to perform
   the ASR test according to ASTM C1567. The experimental results showed
   that the expansion of cement mortar due to ASR can be reduced by the
   addition of nanoclay. Two percent nanoclay was the only dosage among
   others used in this study that can mitigate the expansion. Furthermore,
   the ASR caused a marginal enhancement in compressive strength of mortar
   compared to the specimens cured in water. The gain in strength reached
   up to 10\% for mortars contacting 2\% nanoclay. The X-ray diffraction
   (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis did not detect the
   formation of any secondary products due to the ASR, revealing the
   similarity between ASR and the pozzolanic reaction for the first 14 days
   of the reaction. However, the microstructure of the mortars became
   denser and more homogeneous when apart of cement was replaced by
   nanoclay.}},

Abstract = {{The quantitative analysis of channel networks plays an important role in
   river studies. To provide a quantitative representation of channel
   networks, we propose a newmethod that extracts channels from remotely
   sensed images and estimates their widths. Our fully automated method is
   based on a recently proposed multiscale singularity index that strongly
   responds to curvilinear structures but weakly responds to edges. The
   algorithm produces a channel map using a single image where water and
   nonwater pixels have contrast, such as a Landsat near-infrared band
   image or a water index defined on multiple bands. The proposed method
   provides a robust alternative to the procedures that are used in the
   remote sensing of fluvial geomorphology and makes the classification and
   analysis of channel networks easier. The source code of the algorithm is
   available at http://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/cne/.}},

Abstract = {{A semiotic framework {[}Semiotic Interface sign Design and Evaluation
   (SIDE)] was developed to help designers to deal with user-intuitive
   interface signs. Examples of signs are small images, navigational links,
   buttons and thumbnails, which users make use of when interacting with
   Web UIs. This paper assesses the SIDE framework on the quality of the
   evaluation of interface signs, and the contributions of the framework as
   perceived by evaluators. Two empirical user studies were carried out,
   involving 23 participants. Data were collected via interviews,
   problem-solving assignments and feedback questionnaires, and analyzed
   quantitatively and qualitatively. The study shows that the evaluation of
   using the SIDE framework leads to acceptable score on quality metrics;
   and the subjects evaluate the framework's ease-of-use, contribution, and
   usage in practice positively. The SIDE framework is applicable to design
   and evaluate interface signs and contributes to the improvement in
   understanding the intuitive nature of interface signs.}},

Title = {{Transfer of humoural immunity over two generations in urban pigeons}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Maternal antibodies (MatAb) are known to provide passive protection
   early in life for young vertebrates but their effects on the development
   of offspring immune response across generations are still unknown. Here,
   we investigated the effects of antigen exposure (keyhole limpet
   haemocyanin, KLH) experienced by urban pigeon (Columba livia) females on
   the amount of antigen-specific antibodies (Abs) transferred into the egg
   yolk of their daughters and on the humoural immune response towards this
   same antigen in their grandchildren. We found that chicks from
   KLH-injected maternal grandmothers had a higher humoural response than
   chicks from sham-injected grandmothers. However, we did not detect a
   significant effect of female KLH exposure on the ability of their
   daughters to transmit anti-KLH Abs into their eggs. These results
   suggest that antigen exposure at one generation may shape the immune
   profile of offspring over two next generations, although the underlying
   mechanisms remain to be investigated.}},

   correlation coefficients between PASE with physical and psychosocial
   measures. Test-retest reliability was determined by the intraclass
   correlation coefficient (ICC). The mean PASE-M scores at baseline and
   follow-up were 94.96 (SD 62.82) and 92.19 (SD 64.02). Fair to moderate
   correlation were found between PASE-M and physical function scale, IADL

Abstract = {{Background. Across Europe, transplant centers vary in the content of the
   psychosocial evaluation for eligible living organ donors. To identify
   whether a common framework underlies this variation in this evaluation,
   we studied which psychosocial screening items are most commonly used and
   considered as most important in current psychosocial screening programs
   of living organ donors. Methods. A multivariate analytic method, concept
   mapping, was used to generate a visual representation of the
   ``psychosocial{''} screening items of living kidney and liver donors. A
   list of 75 potential screening items was derived from a systematic
   literature review and sorted and rated for their importance and
   commonness by multidisciplinary affiliated health care professionals
   from across Europe. Results were discussed and fine-tuned during a
   consensus meeting. Results. The analyses resulted in a 6-cluster
   solution. The following clusters on psychosocial screening items were
   identified, listed from most to least important: (1) personal resources,
   (2) motivation and decision making, (3) psychopathology, (4) social
   resources, (5) ethical and legal factors, and (6) information and risk
   processing. Conclusions. We provided a conceptual framework of the
   essential elements in psychosocial evaluation of living donors which can
   serve as a uniform basis for the selection of relevant psychosocial
   evaluation tools, which can be further tested in prospective studies.}},

Abstract = {{Typical covered call strategies collect the equity and volatility risk
   premiums but also embed exposure to a naive equity reversal strategy
   that is uncompensated. This article presents a novel risk and
   performance attribution methodology that deconstructs the strategy into
   these three exposures. Historically, the equity exposure contributed
   most of the risk and return. The short volatility exposure realized a
   Sharpe ratio of nearly 1.0 but contributed only 10\% of the risk. The
   equity reversal exposure contributed approximately 25\% of the risk but
   provided little return in exchange. The authors propose a risk-managed
   covered call strategy that eliminates the uncompensated equity reversal
   exposure. This modified covered call strategy has a superior Sharpe
   ratio, reduced volatility, and reduced downside equity beta.}},

Volume = {{73-74}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A third-order Refined Zigzag Theory for multilayered composite and
   sandwich beams is developed based on the Reissner Mixed Variational
   Theorem. The assumed kinematics enriches the Timoshenko's beam Theory: a
   second- and a third-order smeared polynomial terms along with a
   piece-wise linear contributions are added to the axial displacement,
   whereas the transverse displacement is approximated with a power-series
   expansion up to the second-order term. Transverse shear and normal
   stress, continuous and able to satisfy the boundary stress conditions on
   the outer beam surfaces, are assumed by the model: the transverse shear
   stress is derived with the aid of the Elasticity equations, whereas a
   third-order power-series expansion is adopted for the transverse normal
   stress. Based on the proposed model, an efficient C-0-continuous beam
   element is formulated by adopting the anisoparametric interpolation
   strategy to avoid the shear locking phenomenon. The accuracy of the
   proposed model and the finite element implementation is assessed by
   solving problems concerning the elasto-static behavior of generally
   laminated beams, both simply supported and clamped at the ends.
   Comparison with reference solution (Elasticity or high-fidelity FE
   model) demonstrates the remarkable accuracy of the proposed model, both
   in terms of displacements and stresses distributions, as well as the
   finite element implementation efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A series of Ca2-xLi2xGeO4 specimens with 0 < 2x < 2, were synthesized by
   the classical solid state method. X-ray analysis revealed that for 0 <
   2x < 0.6 only Ca2-xLi2xGeO4 solid solutions of Ca2GeO4 structure
   crystallized. The cell parameters of these solid solutions linearly
   decreased upon increasing the lithium concentration, which means that
   the solutions are in accordance with the Vegard's law. For 2x > 0.6 the
   specimens contained two phases: (i) Ca2-xLi2xGeO4 solid solutions with
   maximum lithium concentration approximately equal to that for 2x = 0.6
   and minimum values of the cell parameters and (ii) Li2CaGeO4 phase. Li2O
   center dot MoO3-Ca2GeO4 high-temperature solutions were used to grow
   Ca2-xLi2xGeO4 solid solutions and Li2CaGeO4 single crystals by the high

Abstract = {{Bismuth titanates of different composition and 3D nanocomposites based
   on opal matrices and bismuth titanates of different structure types have
   been synthesized by sol-gel and alkoxide methods with the use of
   polyhydric alcohols. The suggested procedure for synthesis of bismuth
   titanates Bi12TiO20 with a sillenite structure and Bi2Ti2O7 with a
   pyrochlore structure and layered titanates Bi4Ti3O12 makes it possible
   to decrease the temperature of the onset of formation of a target
   product in powders and a 3D nanocomposite based on opal matrices and to
   reduce the synthesis time. It has been revealed that the aging of the
   initial sol has an effect on the phase composition of bismuth titanates.
   It has been found that formation of the bismuth dititanate phase with a
   pyrochlore structure in the pores of opal matrices (nanoreactors)
   becomes dominating whatever the Bi2O3/TiO2 ratio is (2 : 3 or 1 : 2),
   which is associated with the effect of the size factor on the stability
   of the forming phases. It has been shown that the existence range of
   metastable Bi2Ti2O7 and Bi2SiO5 forming as nanoparticles can be extended
   from 20 to 1000A degrees C through confinement of the reaction zone of
   the sol-gel synthesis in the pores of the opal matrix.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we present technological issues in the deposition of
   polycrystalline diamond films as a backside heat spreader for GaN
   membranes. We compared three nucleation techniques, including standard
   ultrasonic seeding by diamond powder (DP) in deionized water, drop-off
   technique with DP in solution and polymer based nucleation by polyvinyl
   alcohol (PVA) polymer composite containing fine grained DP. The diamond
   growth was performed in a hot filament or microwave plasma chemical
   vapor deposition system. We found that standard nucleation techniques
   (ultrasonic seeding or immersing in diamond powder solution) resulted in
   damaging or cracking of GaN membranes, or low nucleation efficiency in
   the Z-depth of the structures. Implementation of a novel nucleation
   technique with PVA polymer composite containing diamond powder led to
   coating of both bottom and top parts of the membrane including side
   walls. The coverage homogeneity was evaluated by scanning electron
   microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The obtained results indicate that
   the efficiency (and/or nucleation density) of the polymer-based
   technique is comparable with standard ultrasonic seeding and could be
   used in preference for nucleation of soft and fragile substrates. (C)

Abstract = {{The ability to control growth is essential for fundamental studies of
   bacterial physiology and biotechnological applications. We have
   engineered an Escherichia coli strain in which the transcription of a
   key component of the gene expression machinery, RNA polymerase, is under
   the control of an inducible promoter. By changing the inducer
   concentration in the medium, we can adjust the RNA polymerase
   concentration and thereby switch bacterial growth between zero and the
   maximal growth rate supported by the medium. We show that our synthetic
   growth switch functions in a medium-independent and reversible way, and
   we provide evidence that the switching phenotype arises from the
   ultrasensitive response of the growth rate to the concentration of RNA
   polymerase. We present an application of the growth switch in which both
   the wild-type E.coli strain and our modified strain are endowed with the
   capacity to produce glycerol when growing on glucose. Cells in which
   growth has been switched off continue to be metabolically active and
   harness the energy gain to produce glycerol at a twofold higher yield
   than in cells with natural control of RNA polymerase expression.
   Remarkably, without any further optimization, the improved yield is
   close to the theoretical maximum computed from a flux balance model of
   E.coli metabolism. The proposed synthetic growth switch is a promising
   tool for gaining a better understanding of bacterial physiology and for
   applications in synthetic biology and biotechnology.}},

   on a study of children's services in the United Kingdom, the article
   identifies three inter-related tensions experienced by voluntary sector
   participants - tensions between agency and dependency, values and
   pragmatism, and distinctiveness and incorporation. While these can be
   seen to relate to the inherent unity/diversity tension identified in the
   literature (Ospina and Saz-Carranza, 2010), the article argues that they

   is an excerpt from a book length inquiry into, and engagement with, the
   song and dance of 19th-century African American women, as a source of
   self-authored social, literary, and historical text. The inquiry takes
   off from an interdisciplinary exploration of the narratives embedded in
   the cultural performance of early African and African American women. It
   explores continuities and improvisations, discursive strategies,
   articulations of agency, and constructions of identity in a lineage of
   diaspora articulation characterized by ancestral circles, acts of
   historical documentation and witness, and the communal creation of
   liminal space. Weaving together a range of study, including biography
   and anthropology, ethnography and musicology, poetics, art, and cultural
   history, on the loom of storytelling, the work also explores the
   symbolic range of performance inscription by reference to West African,
   ancient Egyptian, and San traditions, proposing an expansion of our
   sources and reading of diaspora literature based on the creative and

Abstract = {{Coarse Grained Reconfigurable Architectures (CGRAs) are emerging as
   enabling platforms to meet the high performance demanded by modern
   applications (e.g. 4G, CDMA, etc.). Recently proposed CGRAs offer
   time-multiplexing and dynamic applications parallelism to enhance device
   utilization and reduce energy consumption at the cost of additional
   memory (up to 50\% area of the overall platform). To reduce the memory
   overheads, novel CGRAs employ either statistical compression,
   intermediate compact representation, or multicasting. Each compaction
   technique has different properties (i.e. compression ratio,
   decompression time and decompression energy) and is best suited for a
   particular class of applications. However, existing research only deals
   with these methods separately. Moreover, they only analyze the
   compaction ratio and do not evaluate the associated energy overheads. To
   tackle these issues, we propose a polymorphic compression architecture
   that interleaves these techniques in a unique platform. The proposed
   architecture allows each application to take advantage of a separate
   compression/decompression hierarchy (consisting of various types and
   implementations of hardware/software decoders) tailored to its needs.
   Simulation results, using different applications (FFT, Matrix
   multiplication, and WLAN), reveal that the choice of compression
   hierarchy has a significant impact on compression ratio (up to 52\%),
   decompression energy (up to 4 orders of magnitude), and configuration
   time (from 33 n to 1.5 s) for the tested applications. Synthesis results
   reveal that introducing adaptivity incurs negligible additional
   overheads (1\%) compared to the overall platform area. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   two-leg ladders are connected with antiferromagnetic (AFM) inter-ladder

   transition occurs in the ground state magnetic phase diagram. In fact a
   jump in the magnetization curve is observed. We found that, coupled
   spin-1/2 FM two-leg ladders are in a nonmagnetic phase at zero

Abstract = {{Increased frequency of drought and shortage of irrigation water has
   challenged forage production in arid and semiarid regions. Farmers have
   shifted from corn (Zea mays L.), as their primary source of forage, to
   more drought-tolerant species such as millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.);
   however, protein content of millet may be too low to meet the needs of
   high-producing animals. A 2-yr field experiment was conducted to
   determine if mixtures of millet with soybean (Glycine max L.) could
   produce acceptable forage and protein yield and at the same time
   maintain farmers' profit level. Main plots consisted of nitrogen (N)
   rates of 0, 37, and 74 kg N ha(-1), and subplots were assigned to
   intercropping ratios (50: 50, 60: 40, and 40: 60 millet-soybean) along
   with sole crops. Nitrogen application increased total dry matter yield,
   and millet sole crop had the highest yield (13.6 t ha(-1)) followed by
   60: 40 millet-soybean (13.1 t ha(-1)). The land equivalent ratio (LER)
   was highest (1.17) in 60: 40 millet-soybean intercrops, indicating 17\%
   more efficient use of land than sole crops. On the basis of the results
   from LER, relative crowding coefficient, and monetary advantage index,
   60: 40 millet-soybean was superior to the other intercropping ratios and

   from 60: 40 millet-soybean intercrops. Considering both yield and
   nitrogen use efficiency, 60: 40 millet-soybean intercropping ratio,

Title = {{A feasibility study of behavioural activation for depressive symptoms in
   adults with intellectual disabilities}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundImportant work has been carried out adapting cognitive
   behavioural therapy for people with intellectual disabilities. However,
   there is a lack of alternative psychological therapies available for
   people with intellectual disabilities and emotional difficulties.
   Behavioural activation for depression is less reliant on verbal
   communication and focuses on increasing purposeful activity and reducing
   avoidance.
   MethodThis feasibility study involved the development and piloting of an
   adapted manual of behavioural activation for people with intellectual
   disabilities. The intervention consisted of 10-12 sessions and a key
   adaptation was that the therapist worked with the clients alongside a
   significant other in their life, either a paid carer or family member.
   Baseline, post-intervention (3 months after entering the study) and
   6-month quantitative follow-up data were obtained. Primary outcome data
   were gathered, concerning depressive symptoms, participants' levels of
   activity and general well-being.
   ResultsTwenty-three adults with intellectual disabilities with symptoms
   of depression were recruited from specialist health services. In terms
   of acceptability, the behavioural activation intervention was well
   received and only two individuals dropped out, with a further two lost
   to follow-up. The main measures of depression appeared to be sensitive
   to change. Pre- to post-intervention data showed a significant reduction
   in self-report of depressive symptoms with a strong effect size
   (r=0.78), that was maintained at follow-up (r=0.86). Positive change was
   also obtained for informant reports of depressive symptoms from pre- to
   post-intervention, with a strong effect size (r=0.7). Once again, this
   positive change was maintained at follow-up (r=0.72).
   ConclusionsThe study suggested that behavioural activation may be a
   feasible and worthwhile approach to tackling depression in people with
   intellectual disabilities. However, a randomised controlled trial would
   be required to establish its effectiveness, with more sensitive
   measurement of change in activity.}},

Abstract = {{Comorbidity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and history of
   traumatic brain injury (TBI) is high among Veterans of Operation Iraqi
   Freedom/Enduring Freedom/New Dawn (OIF/OEF/OND). Cognitive processing
   therapy (CPT) is empirically supported for the treatment of PTSD, but it
   is not specifically designed to accommodate the memory, attention, or
   problem solving deficits that are experienced by many Veterans with
   comorbid PTSD and TBI. Compensatory cognitive rehabilitation, including
   cognitive symptom management and rehabilitation therapy (CogSMART), is
   effective for cognitive deficits stemming from a variety of etiologies,
   including TBI. We have integrated components of CogSMART into CPT in
   order to address the unique challenges faced by Veterans with ongoing
   cognitive complaints related to PTSD and a history of mild TBI. Here we
   describe an ongoing randomized controlled trial investigating the
   efficacy of our novel hybrid treatment, SMART-CPT, as compared to
   standard CPT, for OIF/OEF/OND Veterans with PTSD and a history of mild
   to moderate TBI. We describe the development of this hybrid treatment as

Abstract = {{Tea tree fibres as underutilised fibres were investigated physically,
   chemically and mechanically. From this study, it was found that the tea
   tree leaf (TTL) had the highest density - 0.42 g/cm(3), and the highest
   percentage of water absorption - 69.9\%. From the tensile strength, the
   tea tree trunk (TTT) gave the highest value - 65.44 MPa, followed by the
   tea tree branch (TTB) - 48.43 MPa and tea tree leaf (TTL) - 47.47 MPa.
   The chemical composition of fibres showed TTT had the highest cellulose
   content, which is 33.9\%, followed by TTB - 27.2\%, and TTL - 13.5\%.
   Meanwhile TTL had the highest extractive value - 16.4\%, almost 3 times
   higher than TTB and TTT due to the existence of tea tree oil in TTL.
   From the FTIR result, TTL, TTB and TTT had similar spectra and no major
   differences. This paper aims to rationalise the potential of
   underutilised tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia) waste as a novel source
   of natural fibre, to become a potential reinforcement or filler in the

Abstract = {{Plastics draw a paramount amount of fossil fuel reaching nearly 300
   million tons annually and continue to enter every production sector of
   our lives (automotive, aerospace, packaging, building, toys, furniture,
   clothing, medical etc.). While different from polyolefin, Poly Vinyl
   Chloride (PVC), along with many halogenated polymers, all belong to the
   same thermo-plastic group. Rigid plasticized PVC is commonly used in
   pipes, window framing, floor coverings, roofing sheets, and cables;
   thereby it is discarded at a high rate. Adopting an appropriate
   recycling pathway is of both an economic value and an environmental
   benefit. The high hydrogen chloride content and the concern of dioxins
   and furans emission deter its thermochemical conversion. Re-compounding,
   particularly, when it is generated at a substantial amount and at low
   variation in composition, is the ultimate recycling strategy. In this
   work, analysis of the composition of PVC waste stream from the cable
   industry is carried out. Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) was
   conducted to infer the moisture, volatile, and inorganic filler
   fractions and the extent of thermal stability. These data are important
   to design the proper re-compounding, extrusion and injection conditions
   for the postconsumer PVC. Standard tensile and dynamic stress samples
   were produced and subjected to successive aging, extrusion and molding.
   Thermal properties were insignificantly altered, whereas mechanical
   properties lost some but tolerable flexibility. The results suggesting
   that PVC cable polymer can be reutilized in a close sustainable
   manufacturing which warrants ecological and economic benefit. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In two experiments we tested how explicitly including the cultural
   majority group in an organization's diversity approach (all-inclusive
   multiculturalism) affects the extent to which majority members feel
   included in the organization and support organizational diversity
   efforts. In Study 1 we focused on prospective employees. We found that
   an all-inclusive diversity approach, compared with the standard
   multicultural approach in which the majority group is not explicitly
   made part of organizational diversity, led to higher levels of
   anticipated inclusion for those with a high need to belong. In Study 2
   we turned to sitting organizational members. Here, we again found that
   an all-inclusive multicultural approach increased perceptions of
   inclusion, but now the effect was present regardless of individual
   levels of need to belong. Perceived inclusion, in turn, was positively
   related to majority members' support for organizational diversity
   efforts. Together, these findings underline the effectiveness of an
   all-inclusive multicultural approach towards diversity.}},

Abstract = {{The implementation of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) has
   resulted in inevitable changes in the educational structure of many
   countries. In fact, nowadays public expenditure on higher education is a
   current and vital issue in a complex economic environment with increased
   demands for economic information. This article captures the need to
   establish the impact of some economic and academic variables (observed
   and latent) which determine public expenditure on higher education.
   Through structural equation models applied in a general model over
   thirty European countries along a time series of fourteen years, an
   invariant and stable structure factor can be assumed. From the
   perspective of prediction, statistically significant results indicate
   that it is possible to confirm a general longitudinal model proposed and
   which can be extrapolated to other countries to analyze this level of
   expenditure with the aim of developing improvement proposals.}},

Abstract = {{Influential theories of brain-viscera interactions propose a central
   role for interoception in basic motivational and affective feeling
   states. Recent neuroimaging studies have underlined the insula, anterior
   cingulate, and ventral prefrontal cortices as the neural correlates of
   interoception. However, the relationships between these distributed
   brain regions remain unclear. In this study, we used spatial independent
   component analysis (ICA) and functional network connectivity (FNC)
   approaches to investigate time course correlations across the brain
   regions during visceral interoception. Functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) was performed in thirteen healthy females who underwent
   viscerosensory stimulation of bladder as a representative internal organ
   at different prefill levels, i.e., no prefill, low prefill (100 ml
   saline), and high prefill (individually adapted to the sensations of
   persistent strong desire to void), and with different infusion
   temperatures, i.e., body warm (approximate to 37 degrees C) or ice cold
   (4-8 degrees C) saline solution. During Increased distention pressure on
   the viscera, the insula, striatum, anterior cingulate, ventromedial
   prefrontal cortex, amygdalo-hippocampus, thalamus, brainstem, and
   cerebellar components showed increased activation. A second group of
   components encompassing the insula and anterior cingulate, dorsolateral
   prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices and temporal-parietal
   junction showed increased activity with innocuous temperature
   stimulation of bladder mucosa. Significant differences in the FNC were
   found between the insula and amygdalo-hippocampus, the insula and
   ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex
   and temporal-parietal junction as the distention pressure on the viscera
   increased. These results provide new insight into the supraspinal
   processing of visceral interoception originating from an internal organ.

Title = {{Amino acid composition of the bushcricket spermatophore and the function
   of courtship feeding: Variable composition suggests a dynamic role of
   the nuptial gift}},
Journal = {{PHYSIOLOGY \& BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{151}},
Pages = {{463-468}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Nuptial gifts are packages of non-gametic material transferred by males
   to females at mating. These gifts are common in bushcrickets, where
   males produce a complex spermatophore consisting in a sperm-containing
   ampulla and an edible sperm-free spermatophylax. Two non-mutually
   exclusive hypotheses have been suggested to explain the function of the
   spermatophylax: the paternal investment hypothesis proposes that it
   represents a male nutritional investment in offspring; the mating effort
   hypothesis proposes that the spermatophylax maximizes the male's sperm
   transfer. Because gift production may represent significant energy
   expenditure, males are expected to adjust their investment relative to
   the perceived quality of the female. In this study, we first examined
   the free amino acid composition and protein-bound amino acid composition
   of the nuptial gift in the bushcricket, Ephippiger diurnus (Orthoptera:
   Tettigoniidae). Second, we investigated whether this composition was
   altered according to female age and body weight. Our study represents
   the first investigation of both free and protein-bound amino acid
   fractions of a bushcricket spermatophylax. We found that composition of
   the nuptial gift varied both qualitatively and quantitatively with
   respect to traits of the receiving female: older females received larger
   amounts of protein-bound amino acids (both essential and non-essential),
   less water and less free glycine. This result suggests that gift
   composition is highly labile in E. diurnus, and we propose that gift
   allocation might represent a form of cryptic male mate choice, allowing
   males to maximize their chances of paternity according to the risk of
   sperm competition that is associated with mate quality. (C) 2015

   find various explanations. To improve the knowledge on the thermal
   decomposition of nesquehonite, new thermal data are presented and X-ray
   diffraction was used to follow the evolution of the solid products of
   decomposition. During thermal decomposition, nesquehonite loses its
   water below 300-350 A degrees C whereas CO2 is lost above 300-350 A
   degrees C, but the mechanism of thermal decomposition process is
   influenced by the choice of experimental conditions. The first loss of
   water, between similar to 55 and similar to 135 A degrees C, results in
   a partial collapse of the nesquehonite structure and in the formation of
   a crystalline phase which is referred to as ``phase X{''} (approximately
   MgCO3 center dot 2H(2)O) and this gradually converts into an amorphous
   phase upon further heating and water loss. The regeneration of
   nesquehonite upon rehydration of either ``phase X{''} or the amorphous
   phase suggests that sufficient structural elements persist throughout
   the initial stages of decomposition to reconstitute nesquehonite.}},

Title = {{Introducing Dendrosomal Nanocurcumin as a Compound Capable of in vitro

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{123}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{One of the major obstacles needed to be overcome before using cell
   therapy for clinical purposes is the high probability of tumor formation
   in patients who receive the transplants, as undifferentiated stem cells
   (SCs) have the potential to form teratomas/teratocarcinoma in
   xenotransplants. In this study the ability of dendrosomal nanocurcumin
   (solublized curcumin using a biodegradable non-toxic nano-carrier) to
   affect undifferentiated/hazardous cell, and hence increasing the safety
   of cell therapy (particularly in diabetes type I) by mesenchymal stem
   cells (MSCs) was examined. The results showed that after completion of
   differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) into insulin
   producing cells (IPCs), the expression level of insulin increases,
   although there remains a minority of undifferentiated cells which still
   express nestin (gene which is expressed in progenitor stem cells of
   IPCs). It indicates the emergence of a heterogeneous population
   containing undifferentiated and differentiated cells. Furthermore our
   data demonstrated that the expression level of p53 decreases during
   differentiation of hMSCs into IPCs which implies a more favorable
   microenvironment for tumor formation -following the transplantation of
   such a heterogeneous population. After treatment with dendrosomal
   nanocurcumin, nestin expression eliminated, however no significant
   effect on the expression and secretion of insulin was observed. Together
   our data shows that dendrosomal nanocurcumin have the ability to affect
   residual undifferentiated stem cells after the completion of
   differentiation of MSCs induced to differentiate into IPCs; while it
   exerts no significant harmful effect on the survival and function of
   differentiated cells. With regard to the obtained results in this study,
   exploiting dendrosomal nanocurcumin, after completion of induced
   differentiation of stem cells and prior to the transplantation step, can
   be suggested as a very efficient, safe and cost-effective method to
   eliminate the residual undifferentiated stem cells in cell therapy
   practices in order to considerably decrease the risk of tumor
   development following transplantation.}},

   rs731236 SNPs in 205 RLS patients and 445 healthy controls using a
   TaqMan essay.The frequencies of the rs731236AA genotype and the allelic
   variant rs731236A were significantly lower in RLS patients than in
   controls (P<0.005 and<0.01, respectively). Restless legs syndrome
   patients carrying the allelic variant rs731236G had an earlier age at
   onset, and those carrying the rs731236GG genotype had higher severity of
   RLS, although these data disappeared after multivariate analyses. None
   of the SNPs studied was related with the positivity of family history of

Abstract = {{The intricate interrelationships between environment and society result
   in unique landscapes, each with its own development patterns and rates.
   While many studies have focused on how development impacts the
   environment; this study quantifies the influence of the environment,
   relative to human historical factors, on long-term (1857-2030) and
   large-scale (10,000 km(2)) development patterns in a region with diverse
   physiography. A major component of this paper is the development of a
   Magnitude of Relative Change (MRC) equation to empirically measure
   long-term development trends and rates at regional scale in relation to
   multiple physiographic factors. We simulated past urban development
   trends and forecasted future patterns for the central Arkansas (USA)
   region using a modified SLEUTH-3r urban growth model. In doing this, we
   investigated the relationships and feedbacks between physiographic
   settings of the study area and past and future development patterns.
   Another vital component of this research is the adoption of an
   environmental historical approach to examine and evaluate development
   dynamics within and among ecoregions. Our analytical approach emphasizes
   the potential of environmental forces to influence land development
   transitions and at the same time appreciates the role of human
   advancements on shaping those dynamics. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Water dispersed polypyrrole was chemically synthesized with
   Dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid (DBSA) as dopant and Poly

   coating technique at various spin rates of 1000 rpm, 2000 rpm and 3000
   rpm. The paper reports on effect of spin coating rate, thickness,
   surface roughness, and photoluminescence of water dispersed DBSA / PSS
   /PPY composite thin films. The transmittance is found to be decreased
   with increasing spin rates. Surface roughness of the films were analyzed
   by atomic force microscopy. The Root Mean Square (RMS) and Roughness
   (R-a) values were found as (22.5 nm, 89 nm), (135 nm and 18 nm), and (70
   nm and 113 nm) values. The super hydrophilic nature of the composite
   films was studied by water contact angle measurements. The contact angle
   values were found to be 8.6, 94 and 10 for different spin rates.
   Photoluminescence (PL) of DBSA/PSS/PPY composite films reveals the

   gear train (PGT) with three rotating shafts and a simple control system
   consisting of a few sensors and a control motor controlled by a
   microprocessor. One of the PGT shafts is the input, another is the
   output, and the third is coupled to the control motor as second input.
   The optimal tip-speed ratio is kept constant at low wind speeds by
   controlling the speed of the control motor, maximising the capture of
   energy from the wind. The wind-rotor speed continues to vary above the
   rated wind speed zone, but the rotor shaft power is kept constant by
   using the same control system. In this way, a constant electrical power
   output is achieved without altering the blade pitch, i.e., with the
   rotor in a fixed geometry. A frame design procedure for the transmission
   is proposed, efficiency expressions are derived, an example transmission
   operation is presented and efficiency comparisons to a mainstream
   variable speed wind turbine are carried out. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Introduction: Pediatric pain is a common presenting symptomin the
   prehospital setting; however, there is a lack of data identifying
   factors associated with effective pain management in this population. We
   sought to identify the factors associated with clinically meaningful
   pain reduction in children.
   Methods: An analysis of electronic patient care records of all patients
   younger than 15 years presenting with pain to the emergency medical
   service of Victoria, Australia, over a 4-year period (2008-2011). Data
   were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multivariate regression
   to assess predictors of clinically meaningful pain reduction. Clinically
   meaningful pain reduction was defined as a reduction of 2 or more points
   on an 11-point scale.
   Results: A total of 92378 children were transported, of whom 15016
   (16.3\%) met the inclusion criteria. The median agewas 11 (interquartile
   range, 9-13) years, and 59.2\% were male. Patients older than 9 years
   were less likely (adjusted odds ratio {[}AOR], 0.5; 95\% confidence
   interval {[}CI], 0.4-0.6) and boys were more likely (adjusted odds
   ratio, 1.1; 95\% CI, 1.0-1.3) to have a clinically meaningful reduction
   in pain. Patients with pain classified as musculoskeletal were more
   likely to achieve a reduction in pain score of 2 or more when compared
   with pain due to other medical causes (AOR, 1.7; 95\% CI, 1.5-1.9).
   Conclusions: Factors other than the type of analgesia are important
   determinants of prehospital pain relief and are likely to impact on
   clinical care and research. Clinical audit and research projects should
   stratify patients according to patient as well as management factors to
   maximize service improvement. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   analysis of a class of medium/large nonlinear finite element models

   performed over the space of system parameters. A component mode
   synthesis technique is implemented to carry out the sensitivity analysis
   in a reduced space of generalized coordinates. The reliability
   sensitivity analysis is performed by an approach based on a simple
   post-processing of an advanced sampling-based reliability analysis. The

Abstract = {{Purpose: Estirriation of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) with
   99MTc-HSA equilibrium radionuclide angiography (RA) is frequently used
   for assessing cardiac function. The purpose of this study was to
   investigate the interstudy repeat ability of left (LV) and right (RV)
   ventricular volume and ejection fraction estimations, using a cadmium
   zinc telluride (CZT) SPECT camera.
   Materials and methods: Forty six patients were scanned twice,
   interrupted by repostioning. Each acquisition was analysed twice by two
   experienced technologists. In Interstudy and interobserver variations
   were calculated as the coefficient of variation (CV) and the 95\%
   confidence interval (CI) for limits of agreement (LOA) between each
   sequence of analyses for each of the two acquisitions.
   Results: The Interstudy variations and 95\% CI for LVEF, LV end systolic
   (LVESV) and end diastolic: (LVEDV) volumes were 4.6\% (-5.4 to 6.4),
   9.3\% (-6.90 to 5.20) and 7.0\% (-13.9 to 11.1), respectively. For the
   right ventricle, the corresponding values were 11.9\% (-9.40 to 10.8),
   9.8\% (-14.9 to 10.8) and 8.1\% (-20.7 to 16.3).
   Discussion: The CZT detector camera has excellent reproducibility with
   regard to interstudy variation when assessing LV volumes and EF.
   Interstudy variation is considerably higher for RV volumes and EF,
   indicating a lack of consistency in tracing the boarders of the right
   ventricle.}},

   lock-in amplification. In a Bayesian framework, we investigate the
   correlation between wavelength calibration errors and resulting radial
   velocity errors. We construct an end-to-end simulation of this approach
   to address the feasibility of achieving 10 cm s(-1) radial velocity
   precision on a typical Sun-like star using existing, 5 m-class

Abstract = {{This paper presents a circular microfluidic centrifuge with two inlets
   and two outlets to separate mixed microparticles with a specially
   designed sample injection hole. To separate the mixed particles, it uses
   a rotational flow, generated in a chamber by counter primary flows in
   the microchannels. The shape and sizes of the circular microfluidic
   centrifuge have been designed through numerical evaluation to have a
   large relative centrifugal force. The difference of centrifuge times of
   the mixed particles of 1 mu m and 6 mu m was determined to be 8.2 s at
   an inlet Reynolds number of 500 and a sample Reynolds number of 20. In
   the experiment, this was measured to be about 10 s. From the separation
   of the two polymer particles analogous to the representative sizes of
   platelets and red blood cells, the circular microfluidic centrifuge
   shows a potential to separate human blood cells size-selectively by
   using the difference of centrifuge times.}},

   Foot pain, cavovarus feet, tibialis anterior atrophy, absent reflexes,
   and inability to walk were found when the patient was age 6 years. Nerve
   conduction studies showed evidence of a sensorimotor polyneuropathy and
   compressive mononeuropathies of bilateral median nerves at the wrist and
   ulnar nerves at the elbow. Genetic testing revealed deletion of a PMP22
   allele and T118M PMP22 mutation in the remaining allele. Conclusions:
   The severe sensorimotor polyneuropathy and hereditary neuropathy with
   liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) in this patient was likely a
   consequence of both decreased expression of PMP22 causing features
   consistent with HNPP and unopposed expression of the T118M mutant form
   of PMP22 that is relatively benign in the heterozygous state. The T118M
   mutant form of PMP22 can be disease-modifying in the appropriate
   circumstances. Muscle Nerve52: 905-908, 2015}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Ocular vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (oVEMPs)
   represent extraocular muscle activity in response to vestibular
   stimulation. The authors sought to investigate whether posture-induced
   increase of the intracranial pressure (ICP) modulated oVEMP frequency
   tuning, that is, the amplitude ratio between 500-Hz and 1000-Hz stimuli.
   Design: Ten healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. The subjects
   were positioned in the horizontal plane (0 degree) and in a 30-degree
   head-downwards position to elevate the ICP. In both positions, oVEMPs
   were recorded using 500-Hz and 1000-Hz air-conducted tone bursts.
   Results: When tilting the subject from the horizontal plane to the
   30-degree head-down position, oVEMP amplitudes in response to 500-Hz
   tone bursts distinctly decreased (3.40 V versus 2.06 V; p < 0.001),
   whereas amplitudes to 1000 Hz were only slightly diminished (2.74 V
   versus 2.48 V; p = 0.251). Correspondingly, the 500/1000-Hz amplitude
   ratio significantly decreased when tilting the subjects from 0- to
   30-degree inclination (1.59 versus 1.05; p = 0.029). Latencies were not
   modulated by head-down position.
   Conclusions: Increasing ICP systematically alters oVEMPs in terms of
   absolute amplitudes and frequency tuning characteristics. oVEMPs are
   therefore in principle suited for noninvasive ICP monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{The surgical Apgar score predicts major 30-day postoperative
   complications using data assessed at the end of surgery. We hypothesized
   that evaluating the surgical Apgar score continuously during surgery may
   identify patients at high risk for postoperative complications. We
   retrospectively identified general, vascular, and general oncology
   patients at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Logistic regression
   methods were used to construct a series of predictive models in order to
   continuously estimate the risk of major postoperative complications, and
   to alert care providers during surgery should the risk exceed a given
   threshold. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
   (AUROC) was used to evaluate the discriminative ability of a model
   utilizing a continuously measured surgical Apgar score relative to
   models that use only preoperative clinical factors or continuously
   monitored individual constituents of the surgical Apgar score (i.e.
   heart rate, blood pressure, and blood loss). AUROC estimates were
   validated internally using a bootstrap method. 4,728 patients were
   included. Combining the ASA PS classification with continuously measured
   surgical Apgar score demonstrated improved discriminative ability (AUROC
   0.80) in the pooled cohort compared to ASA (0.73) and the surgical Apgar
   score alone (0.74). To optimize the tradeoff between inadequate and
   excessive alerting with future real-time notifications, we recommend a
   threshold probability of 0.24. Continuous assessment of the surgical
   Apgar score is predictive for major postoperative complications. In the
   future, real-time notifications might allow for detection and mitigation
   of changes in a patient's accumulating risk of complications during a
   surgical procedure.}},

Abstract = {{Background: All ceramics are the material of choice for aesthetic tooth
   replacements. The success of all ceramic restoration depends on the bond
   between the ceramic and the tooth surface hence this study was done to
   evaluate the shear bond strength of Feldspathic CAD/CAM ceramic with
   <5\% hydrofluoric acid and hydrofluoric acid combined with silane
   coupling agent.
   Aim: To evaluate the shear bond strength of Feldspathic CAD/CAM ceramic
   with Dentin using bonding agents Prime \& Bond NT, XenoIII and surface
   treatments <5\% hydrofluric acid, hydrofluric acid combined with silane
   coupling agent.
   Materials and Methods: Forty cylinders with 6mm diameter and 5mm height
   were milled from CEREC Blocs through CAD/CAM technology. Cerec blocks
   were bonded to etch freshly extracted tooth surface using a self etch
   and total etch bonding agent. The samples were divided into 4 groups.
   Group A1-Ceramic cylinders were treated with <5\% HF and bonded using
   Prime \& Bond NT and Variolink II. Group A2-treated with <5\% HF and
   silane coupling agent and bonded same as group A1. Group B1-treated with
   <5\% HF and bonded using Xeno III and Variolink II. Group B2-treated
   with <5\% HF and silane coupling agent, and bonded same as Group A3. The
   shear bond strength was evaluated after 24 hours by Storing in distilled
   water in Instron 3385 universal testing machine with 10-KN force.
   Results: Statistical analysis was done using student's t-test and
   Lavene's test. The p-value < 0.05 shows significant difference in bond
   strength between A1 and A2 \& B1 and B2.
   Conclusion: The application of a silane coupling agent to the ceramic
   surface after etching with hydrofluoric acid increased the adhesion
   strength with both bonding agents. Student's t-test revealed a
   significant effect of silanization.}},

Abstract = {{Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) remains to be a major global health problem
   despite many decades of parenteral use of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)
   vaccine. Developing safe and effective respiratory mucosal TB vaccines
   represents a unique challenge. Over the past decade or so, the human
   serotype 5 adenovirus (AdHu5)-based TB vaccine has emerged as one of the
   most promising candidates based on a plethora of preclinical and early
   clinical studies. However, anti-AdHu5 immunity widely present in the
   lung of humans poses a serious gap and limitation to its real-world
   applications. In this study we have developed a novel chimpanzee
   adenovirus 68 (AdCh68)-vectored TB vaccine amenable to the respiratory
   route of vaccination. We have evaluated AdCh68-based TB vaccine for its
   safety, T-cell immunogenicity, and protective efficacy in relevant
   animal models of human pulmonary TB with or without parenteral BCG
   priming. We have also compared AdCh68-based TB vaccine with its AdHu5
   counterpart in both naive animals and those with preexisting anti-AdHu5
   immunity in the lung. We provide compelling evidence that AdCh68-based
   TB vaccine is not only safe when delivered to the respiratory tract but,
   importantly, is also superior to its AdHu5 counterpart in induction of
   T-cell responses and immune protection, and limiting lung
   immunopathology in the presence of preexisting anti-AdHu5 immunity in
   the lung. Our findings thus suggest AdCh68-based TB vaccine to be an
   ideal candidate for respiratory mucosal immunization, endorsing its
   further clinical development in humans.}},

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE The selective BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib have
   shown significant improvement in patient survival compared with standard
   therapy in BRAF V600-mutant metastatic melanoma.
   OBSERVATIONS We reviewed Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event
   Reporting System (FAERS) data for both agents for renal toxic effects.
   From July 2011 through June 2014, 132 cases of acute kidney injury in
   patients receiving vemurafenib therapy were reported. Renal injury was
   more common in men (85 men vs 47 women; P < .001). From April 2013
   through June 2014, 13 cases of renal injury in patients receiving
   dabrafenib therapy were reported (12 men and 1 woman). Hypokalemia (6
   cases in patients receiving vemurafenib and 2 cases in patients
   receiving dabrafenib) and hyponatremia (8 and 6 cases, respectively)
   were also reported.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Vemurafenib seems to be more nephrotoxic than
   dabrafenib. This renal toxicity seems to be more prevalent among male
   patients with melanoma. On the basis of the few published case reports,
   the mode of injury seems to be tubular interstitial injury. Our findings
   suggest a need to monitor renal function and electrolyte levels in all
   patients who receive these drugs. Dermatologists, oncologists, and
   nephrologists need to be aware of this potential hazard.}},

Abstract = {{The binding of transcription coactivator Yes-associated protein (YAP) to
   Smad transcription factors is an important event in activating
   transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling pathway, which is
   involved in the tumorigenicity and metastasis of bone tumor. Design of
   peptide aptamers to disrupt YAP-Smad interaction has been established as
   a promising approach for bone tumor therapy. Here, an evolution strategy
   was used to optimize Smad-derived peptides for high potency binding to
   YAP WW2 domain, resulting in an improved peptide population, from which
   those high-scoring candidates were characterized rigorously using
   molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and interaction free energy
   calculations. With the computational protocol we were able to generate a
   number of potential domain binders, which were then substantiated by
   using fluorescence spectroscopy assay. Subsequently, the complex
   structure of YAP WW2 domain with a high-affinity peptide was modeled and
   examined in detail, which was then used to guide structure-based peptide
   optimization to obtain several strong domain binders. Structural and
   energetic analysis revealed that electrostatic complementarity is
   primarily responsible for domain-peptide recognition, while other
   nonbonded interactions such as hydrogen bonding and salt bridges can
   contribute significantly to the recognition specificity.}},

   magnets increases by 11.81 kOe, while the remanence keeps almost
   invariant. investigation shows that Dy is preferentially enriched as
   (Nd,Dy)(2)Fe14B phase in the surface region of the Nd2Fe14B matrix

   magneto-crystalline anisotropy field of the magnet. As a result, the
   magnet diffused with a small amount of DyH3 nano-particles possesses
   enhanced coercivity without remarkably sacrificing its magnetization.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we learn a Contrastive Feature Distribution Model (CFDM)
   for interaction recognition. Our contributions are three-folded. First
   of all, we introduce an intra-inter-frame skeleton feature for
   interaction description. Secondly, we learn CFDM for a discriminative
   representation of interactions. In this step, we mine contrastive
   features to create a dictionary, and learn the probability distribution
   of dictionary words to construct CFDM in positive and negative training
   samples. With CFDM, we represent interactions in a discriminative way
   for recognition. Since there is few skeleton based interaction databases
   now, we capture a new database, CR-UESTC, which is the third
   contribution. We evaluate the proposed CFDM approach on CR-UESTC and SBU
   interaction databases, and compare the result of CFDM with the CM and
   the BoW approach. The comparison indicates that the recognition accuracy
   of three approaches is: CFDM > CM > BoW. Compared with Yun et al.
   (2012), the proposed CFDM also obtain a better result on SBU database.

   combining both delay constraints and path length to destination nodes.
   By taking advantage of the delay parameter and the queue management

Abstract = {{We have investigated three-dimensional (3D) spin configurations of a
   one-dimensional (1D) array composed of three ferromagnetic nanocubes by
   means of micromagnetic simulations. In order to modulate the
   magnetostatic interaction between adjacent nanocuboids, the magnetic
   field was applied as a controllable external magnetostatic environment.
   Without any external field, the spin configurations of the asymmetric 3D
   magnetic vortex structures in each nanocube exhibit identical magnetic
   chirality. With the increase of the external field, the magnetostatic
   environment was gradually dominated by the external field, and enhanced
   the component along field direction of the magnetostatic interaction
   between nanocuboids, and even accelerated the formation of the
   cylindrical 3D vortex spin structure at the center of each cuboid lying
   in the field direction. Interestingly, under a 100 mT field less than
   the saturation field, the ferromagnetic array exhibited negative
   magnetic energy, with the three vortex structures occasionally
   exhibiting opposing chiralities. There was a competitive relationship
   amongst the shape anisotropy, magnetic energy minimization, and
   magnetostatic interaction between ferromagnetic nanocuboids, leading to
   the complex spin configuration and the negative energy phenomenon of the

Abstract = {{Web search query suggestion is an important functionality that
   facilitates information seeking of search engine users. In existing
   work, the concepts of diversification and personalization have been
   individually introduced to query suggestion systems. In this paper, we
   propose a new query suggestion paradigm, Query Suggestion With
   Diversification and Personalization (QS-DP) to effectively integrate
   diversification and personalization into one unified framework. In the
   QS-DP, the suggested queries are effectively diversified to cover
   different facets of the input query while the ranking of the suggested
   queries are personalized to ensure that the top ones are those that
   align with a user's personal preferences. We evaluate QS-DP on a
   commercial search engine query log against several existing query
   suggestion methods. The experimental results verify our hypothesis that
   diversification and personalization can be effectively integrated and
   they are able to enhance each other within the QS-DP framework, which
   significantly outperforms several strong baselines with respect to a
   series of metrics. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aluminum production relies on the smelting process which consumes huge
   amounts of electrical energy. One possible solution to reduce the fossil
   fuel consumption by aluminum production is the integration of wind
   power. Based on this background, this paper studies an isolated power
   system for aluminum smelting production with a high penetration of wind
   power. A dynamic model of the aluminum smelter load (ASL) is introduced
   in this paper using the field experiment data. Based on this model, the
   dynamic model of the isolated system considering demand side
   participation is proposed. The MPC-based frequency controller is
   proposed to keep the frequency deviation within a proper range (0.1 Hz)
   under wind power fluctuation as well as to recover the system frequency
   after a large disturbance (such as one generator trip). Finally,
   simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MPC
   based frequency controller.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate how changes in alcohol price and affordability are
   related to aggregate level alcohol consumption in Australia to help to
   inform effective price and tax policy to influence consumption.
   Annual time series data between 1974 and 2012 on price and per-capita
   consumption for beer, wine and spirits and average weekly income were
   collected from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Using a Vector
   Autoregressive model and impulse response analysis, the dynamic
   responses of alcohol consumption to changes in alcohol prices and
   affordability were estimated.
   Alcohol consumption in Australia was negatively associated with alcohol
   price and positively associated with the affordability of alcohol. The
   results of the impulse response analysis suggest that a 10\% increase in
   the alcohol price was associated with a 2\% decrease in the
   population-level alcohol consumption in the following year, with
   further, diminishing, effects up to year 8, leading to an overall 6\%
   reduction in total consumption. In contrast, when alcohol affordability
   increased, per-capita alcohol consumption increased over the following 6
   years.
   Our findings suggest that increasing alcohol prices or taxes can help to
   reduce alcohol consumption at the population level in Australia.
   However, the impact of affordability in our findings highlights that
   pricing policies need to consider increases in income to ensure
   effectiveness. Alcohol price policy should only cautiously focus on
   individual beverage types, because increasing the price of one beverage
   generally leads to an increase in consumption of substitutes.}},

Abstract = {{The coupling effect between ship motion response and internal sloshing
   flow is analyzed in this paper. The viscous two-phase flow model in
   OpenFOAM based on the Volume Of Fluid (VOF) interface capturing
   technique is adopted for solving the internal sloshing flow, while an
   impulse response function (IRF) method is employed for external ship
   response. A three-dimensional simplified LNG-FPSO ship with two
   partially-filled prismatic tanks is considered. Numerical simulations
   show that the coupling effect is significant at low-filling conditions
   in Beam Sea and the typical anti-rolling characteristics can be observed
   in such cases. The ship motion response shows strong sensitivity to
   incident wave steepness, especially around the natural frequencies for
   ship motion and sloshing motion respectively. Besides, no impact
   behavior in sloshing pressure and moment signals is observed when the
   incident wave is close to natural frequency of ship motion. Instead,
   impact phenomena can be observed only when the incident wave is close to
   sloshing natural frequency. However, the steady-state ship motion
   response is still found to be almost linear and sinusoidal at that wave
   frequency. The high-erorder harmonics of the sloshing moment are
   filtered out by the system. The sloshing impact loading has no
   significant coupling effect on global ship response. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Purpose: To examine the relationship between the relative load in full
   squats and the height achieved in jump-squat (JS) exercises and to
   determine the load that maximizes the power output of high-level
   athletes. Method: Fifty-one male high-level track-and-field athletes
   (age 25.2 +/- 4.4 y, weight 77. +/- 6.2 kg, height 179.9 +/- 5.6 cm) who
   competed in sprinting and jumping events took part in the study.
   Full-squat 1-repetition-maximum (1-RM) and JS height (JH) with loads
   from 17 to 97 kg were measured in 2 sessions separated by 48 h. Results:
   Individual regression analyses showed that JH (R-2 = .992 +/- .005) and
   the jump decrease (JD) that each load produced with respect to the
   unloaded countermovement jump (CMJ) (R-2 = .992 +/- 0.007) are highly
   correlated with the full-squat \%1-RM, which means that training
   intensities can be prescribed using JH and JD values. The authors also
   found that the load that maximizes JS's power output was 0\%RM (ie,
   unloaded CMJ). Conclusions: These results highlight the close
   relationship between JS performance and relative training intensity in
   terms of \%1-RM. The authors also observed that the load that maximizes
   power output was 0\%1-RM. Monitoring jump height during JS training
   could help coaches and athletes determine and optimize their training
   loads.}},

Abstract = {{Our daily driving experience and empirical observations suggest that
   traffic patterns in a road network are relatively stationary during peak
   periods. In numerous transportation network studies, there has been an
   implicit conjecture that stationary states exist in a network when
   origin demands, route choice proportions, and destination supplies are
   constant. In this study, we first rigorously formulate the conjecture
   within the framework of a network kinematic wave theory with an
   invariant junction model. After defining stationary states, we derive a
   system of algebraic equations in 3-tuples of stationary link flow-rates,
   demands, and supplies. We then introduce a new definition of junction
   critical demand levels based on effective demands and supplies. With a
   map in critical demand levels, we show that its fixed points and,
   therefore, stationary states exist with the help of Brouwer's fixed
   point theorem. For two simple road networks, we show that the map is
   well-defined and can be used to solve stationary states with a
   brute-force method. Finally we summarize the study and present some
   future extensions and applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The MET receptor tyrosine kinase, the receptor for hepatocyte growth
   factor (HGF), has been implicated in cancer growth, invasion, migration,
   angiogenesis, and metastasis in a broad variety of human cancers,
   including human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recently, MET was
   suggested to be a potential target for the personalized treatment of HCC
   with an active HGF-MET signaling pathway. However, the mechanisms of
   resistance to MET inhibitors need to be elucidated to provide effective
   treatment. Here, we show that HCC cells exhibit different sensitivities
   to the MET inhibitor PHA665752, depending on the phosphorylation status
   of FGFR. Treatment of cells expressing both phospho-FGFR and phospho-MET
   with the inhibitor PHA665752 did not cause growth inhibition and cell
   death, whereas treatment with AZD4547, a pan-FGFR inhibitor, resulted in
   decreased colony formation and cleavage of caspase-3. Moreover,
   silencing of endogenous FGFR1 and FGFR2 by RNAi of HCC cells expressing
   phospho-FGFR, phospho-FGFR2, and phospho-MET overcame the resistance to
   PHA665752 treatment. Treatment of primary cancer cells from patients
   with HCC expressing both phospho-FGFR and phospho-MET with PHA665752 did
   not induce cell death, whereas AZD4547 treatment induced cell death
   through the cleavage of caspase-3. In addition, treatment of cells
   resistant to PHA665752 with AZD4547 abrogated the activation of
   downstream effectors of cell growth, proliferation, and survival. On the
   basis of these results, we conclude that the FGFR pathway is critical
   for HCC survival, and that targeting this pathway with AZD4547 may be
   beneficial for the treatment of patients with HCC-expressing
   phospho-FGFR and phospho-MET. (C) 2015 AACR.}},

   polyhydroxy butyrate-co-valerate (PHBV) have been prepared by melt

   make the blends. The effects of three different types of clay
   (montmorillonite, bentonite, and chemically modified bentonite) on the
   mechanical and thermal properties of the blends were studied. The ratio
   of PLA and PHBV (w/w) was maintained at 70:30 while the weight of clay
   was fixed at 1\%. The addition of clay was found to result in a slight
   increase in tensile strength and modulus. Viscoelastic studies revealed
   that the damping property of the blends decreased with the addition of
   clay. This was attributed to the decreased segmental motion in the
   molecular chains. The morphology of the blends has been investigated by
   environmental scanning electron microscopy and a homogenous surface was
   observed for the blend containing montmorillonite. (c) 2014 Society of

Abstract = {{Frustration is an everyday experience for many users of game media.
   Distinct from related sensations such as difficulty, frustration is
   perhaps best characterized as when the agency of the player becomes
   obstructed. This can lead to the feeling of an ambivalent, uncooperative
   relationship with the game machine. This article will focus on two
   examples to demonstrate some of the possible manifestations of
   frustration in game media. The first, Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor, will
   deal with motion control gestures that are misinterpreted by the game in
   a way that obstructs the player's ability to interact with the game. The
   second, Papers, Please, will consider repetitive gameplay that limits
   the player's actions. Drawing on recent scholarship in animation
   studies, both cases will be approached as a form of what Sianne Ngai
   describes as animatedness, the feeling of becoming an automaton and of
   having one's agency frustrated by technology.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The problem of defining `critical thinking' needs a fresh approach. When
   one takes into consideration the sheer quantity of definitions and their
   obvious differences, an onlooker might be tempted to conclude that there
   is no inherent meaning to the term: that each author seems to consider
   that he or she is free to offer a definition that suits them. And, with
   a few exceptions, there has not been much discussion among proposers
   about the strength and weaknesses of the attempted definitions.
   Therefore, the approach we will argue for here is a `meta-level
   approach': proposers of new definitions of `critical thinking' should
   begin by arguing that none of the current crop of definitions is viable.
   They should then state what kind of definition they will offer; then
   provide the definition and show that it satisfies the criteria stated.
   Our position is that new definitions should follow this meta-level
   approach, in addition to avoiding some common pitfalls.}},

Journal = {{ARCHIV FUR RELIGIONSGESCHICHTE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{51-65}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{I begin by summarizing work that has been done concerning a persistent
   question in the study of ancient magic: how did practitioners balance
   empirical reality against their own imaginations? I go on to suggest
   that my recent work on Greek myths, which uses ideas developed in media
   studies and social psychology, can help. This work suggests that myths'
   authority rested in large part on their effectiveness as lively,
   cognitively-engaging narrations, which in turn enabled audience members
   to build strong relationships with the myths' characters, who were the
   gods and heroes worshipped in cult. For purposes of the present article,
   the most important point to emerge from my work is that each name of a
   mythic character instantly evokes for the audience a large, vivid
   history of that character and of his or her interactions with other
   characters. I then go on to examine what amounts to `Greek myth' in many
   magical papyri of later antiquity-not stories per se, but the listing of
   characters' names. Extending my earlier observations, I suggest that the
   vivid story-world that these names created for each person who spoke,
   read or heard the spells, gave those spells enormous authority by
   evoking larger narratives or complexes of narratives. To illustrate
   this, I examine PGM IV. 1390-1495, a spell that lists a large number of
   Underworld divinities. I offer variations of my approach by examining
   PGM IV. 3209-54, a `Saucer Divination of Aphrodite,' and PGM
   IV.2891-2942, a `Love Spell of Attraction.'}},

Title = {{Questioning short-term memory and its measurement: Why digit span

Abstract = {{Traditional accounts of verbal short-term memory explain differences in
   performance for different types of verbal material by reference to
   inherent characteristics of the verbal items making up memory sequences.
   The role of previous experience with sequences of different types is
   ostensibly controlled for either by deliberate exclusion or by
   presenting multiple trials constructed from different random
   permutations. We cast doubt on this general approach in a detailed
   analysis of the basis for the robust finding that short-term memory for
   digit sequences is superior to that for other sequences of verbal
   material. Specifically, we show across four experiments that this
   advantage is not due to inherent characteristics of digits as verbal
   items, nor are individual digits within sequences better remembered than
   other types of individual verbal items. Rather, the advantage for digit
   sequences stems from the increased frequency, compared to other verbal
   material, with which digits appear in random sequences in natural
   language, and furthermore, relatively frequent digit sequences support
   better short-term serial recall than less frequent ones. We also provide
   corpus-based computational support for the argument that performance in
   a short-term memory setting is a function of basic associative learning
   processes operating on the linguistic experience of the rememberer. The
   experimental and computational results raise questions not only about
   the role played by measurement of digit span in cognition generally, but
   also about the way in which long-term memory processes impact on
   short-term memory functioning. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{A popular PT-symmetric optical potential (variation of the refractive
   index) that supports a variety of interesting and unusual phenomena is
   the imaginary exponential, the limiting case of the potential as lambda
   -> 1, the symmetry-breaking point. For lambda < 1, when the spectrum is
   entirely real, there is a well-known mapping by a similarity
   transformation to an equivalent Hermitian potential. However, as lambda
   -> 1, the spectrum, while remaining real, contains Jordan blocks in
   which eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions coincide. In this
   limit the similarity transformation becomes singular. Nonetheless, we
   show that the mapping from the original potential to its Hermitian
   counterpart can still be implemented; however, the inverse mapping
   breaks down. We also illuminate the role of Jordan associated functions
   in the original problem, showing that they map onto eigenfunctions in
   the associated Hermitian problem.}},

Abstract = {{This article critically examines the consequences of the neoliberal
   reorganisation of the welfare state for social work in Sweden in a time
   of increasing poverty, marginalisation and social problems. The retreat
   of the welfare state from its traditional obligations has resulted in
   the emergence of many voluntary and private actors in the Swedish `care
   market', driving social work to authoritative action of social control
   and engagement in charitable activities. Based on a review of recent
   events indicating that municipal social work is in crisis, it is shown
   that critical voices are reacting against the increasing shortcomings of
   the welfare state, including municipal social work practices. It is
   argued that the pursuit of rights-based social work is urgent and that
   social work should be engaged in raising critical questions influencing
   public debate in order to counteract the increasing neoliberal
   dissolution of the Swedish welfare state and social work, which has led
   to increasing inequalities and injustices.}},

Abstract = {{Proliferation, integration, and neurite extension of PC12 cells, a
   widely used culture model for cholinergic neurons, were studied in
   nanocellulose scaffolds biosynthesized by Gluconacetobacter xylinus to
   allow a three-dimensional (3D) extension of neurites better mimicking
   neuronal networks in tissue. The interaction with control scaffolds was
   compared with cationized nanocellulose (trimethyl ammonium betahydroxy
   propyl {[}TMAHP] cellulose) to investigate the impact of surface charges
   on the cell interaction mechanisms. Furthermore, coatings with
   extracellular matrix proteins (collagen, fibronectin, and laminin) were
   investigated to determine the importance of integrin-mediated cell
   attachment. Cell proliferation was evaluated by a cellular proliferation
   assay, while cell integration and neurite propagation were studied by
   simultaneous label-free Coherent anti-Stokes Raman Scattering and second
   harmonic generation microscopy, providing 3D images of PC12 cells and
   arrangement of nanocellulose fibrils, respectively. Cell attachment and
   proliferation were enhanced by TMAHP modification, but not by protein
   coating. Protein coating instead promoted active interaction between the
   cells and the scaffold, hence lateral cell migration and integration.
   Irrespective of surface modification, deepest cell integration measured
   was one to two cell layers, whereas neurites have a capacity to
   integrate deeper than the cell bodies in the scaffold due to their fine
   dimensions and amoeba-like migration pattern. Neurites with lengths of
   >50m were observed, successfully connecting individual cells and cell
   clusters. In conclusion, TMAHP-modified nanocellulose scaffolds promote
   initial cellular scaffold adhesion, which combined with additional
   cell-scaffold treatments enables further formation of 3D neuronal
   networks.}},

Abstract = {{Biofilm research is growing more diverse and dependent on
   high-throughput technologies, and the large-scale production of results
   aggravates data substantiation. In particular, experimental protocols
   are often adapted to meet the needs of a particular laboratory, and no
   statistical validation of the modified method is provided. This paper
   discusses the impact of intralaboratory adaptation and non-rigorous
   documentation of experimental protocols on biofilm data interchange and
   validation. The case study is a non-standard, but widely used, workflow
   for Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm development considering three
   analysis assays: the crystal violet (CV) assay for biomass
   quantification, the
   2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide
   inner salt (XTT) assay for respiratory activity assessment, and the
   colony forming units (CFU) assay for determination of cell viability.
   The ruggedness of the protocol was assessed by introducing small changes
   in the biofilm growth conditions, which simulate minor protocol
   adaptations and non-rigorous protocol documentation. Results show that
   even minor variations in the biofilm growth conditions may affect the
   results considerably, and that the biofilm analysis assays lack
   repeatability. Intralaboratory validation of non-standard protocols is
   found critical to ensure data quality and enable the comparison of
   results within and among laboratories.}},

Abstract = {{Thyroid cancer is a rapidly increasing endocrine cancer. Since
   interleukin-4 receptor (IL4R) is overexpressed in human solid cancer, we
   examined expression of IL-4R in 50 cases of anaplastic thyroid cancer
   (ATC), 37 well-differentiated papillary cancer (WDPC), 35
   well-differentiated follicular cancer of thyroid (WDFC), and 37 normal
   thyroid specimens by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in-situ
   hybridization (ISH) techniques. We demonstrated that IL-4R alpha was
   overexpressed in 36/50 (72\%) ATC, 20/35 (57\%) WDFC, and 11/37 (30\%)
   WDPC tumors. Other two subunits of IL-4R, interleukin-13 receptor alpha
   1 (IL-13R alpha 1) and interleukin-2 receptor gamma (IL-2R gamma C),
   were either weakly expressed or absent. As ATC is a highly aggressive
   cancer with higher incidence of IL-4R alpha expression, we characterized
   IL-4R in 3 ATC cell lines. RT-qPCR and IFA results showed that IL-4R
   alpha is overexpressed while IL-13R alpha 1 is weakly expressed. Control
   human umbilical vein endothelial cell line (HUVEC) showed weak
   expression of IL-4R alpha. Binding and competition studies with
   125I-IL-4 in ATC cell lines demonstrated that IL-4 specifically bound to
   IL-4R alpha on cell surface. ATC cell lines were highly sensitive to a
   chimeric fusion cytotoxin consisting of circularly permuted IL-4 and
   truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin (IL-4-PE), which killed them in a
   concentration dependent manner. IL-4-PE also blocked colony formation of
   ATC cell lines in clonogenic assays. IL-4-PE mediated a significant
   antitumor activity in mouse models of ATC. Intratumoral administration
   of IL-4-PE caused significant regression of established tumors in a dose
   dependent manner and increased the overall survival without any visible
   toxicity. Thus, IL-4R alpha in ATC may represent a novel therapeutic
   target and IL-4-PE may serve as an investigational therapeutic option
   for ATC.}},

Abstract = {{Between 1733 and 1736, Edward Cave offered a series of eight poetry
   contests in his newly founded Gentleman's Magazine. These competitions
   varied widely in theme and scale, ranging from an offer of free back
   issues for the best set of epigrams to a substantial A 50 pound prize
   for the best poem, in English or Latin, on a weighty devotional topic.
   Taken as a whole, Cave's contests were an attempt to appropriate and
   supplant incumbent sources of literary prestige, particularly the
   traditional model of courtly and aristocratic patronage. Just as Richard
   Savage set himself up in the 1730s as a `volunteer laureate', the
   Gentleman's Magazine offered itself to English elites as a volunteer
   patron and would-be tastemaker. This attempt to assert the magazine's
   critical authority by adapting traditional patronage models and
   appealing to the Whiggish Hanoverian court was a failure; even today,
   the critical judgements and canonical consecrations of opposition
   figures like Pope are dominant. I close by suggesting that Cave's
   contests may have a further legacy as an influence on the career of the
   young Samuel Johnson.}},

Abstract = {{A Cr/SBA-16 catalyst was prepared using Cr(NO3)(3) as a precursor and
   mesoporous silica SBA-16 as a support via a simple impregnation method.
   The catalyst was characterized using wide-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD),
   low-angle XRD, N-2 adsorption-desorption, transmission electron
   microscopy, and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. The catalyst activity
   was investigated in the direct hydroxylation of benzene to phenol using
   H2O2 as the oxidant. Various operating variables, namely reaction
   temperature, reaction time, amount of H2O2, and catalyst dosage, were
   optimized using central composite design combined with response surface
   methodology (RSM). The results showed that the correlation between the
   independent parameters and phenol yield was represented by a
   second-order polynomial model. The high correlation coefficient (R-2),
   i.e., 0.985, showed that the data predicted using RSM were in good
   agreement with the experimental results. The optimization results also
   showed that high selectivity for phenol was achieved at the optimized
   values of the operating variables: reaction temperature 324 K, reaction
   time 8 h, H2O2 content 3.28 mL, and catalyst dosage 0.09 g. This study
   showed that RSM was a reliable method for optimizing process variables
   for benzene hydroxylation to phenol. (C) 2015, Dalian Institute of

Abstract = {{Objective: Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic that has been used
   off-label for the treatment of intensive care unit (ICU) delirium in the
   adult population, with studies demonstrating both efficacy and a
   favorable safety profile. Although there is a potential role for
   quetiapine in the treatment of pediatric ICU delirium, there has been no
   systematic reporting to date of safety in this patient population.
   Methods: Pharmacy records were used to identify 55 consecutive pediatric
   ICU patients who were diagnosed with delirium and received quetiapine. A
   comprehensive retrospective medical chart review was performed to
   collect data on demographics, dosing, and side effects. Results: Fifty
   patients treated between January 2013 and November 2014 were included,
   and five patients were excluded from the study. Subjects ranged in age
   from 2 months to 20 years. Median daily dose was 1.3mg/kg/day, and
   median duration of treatment was 12 days. There were three episodes of
   QTc prolongation that were clinically nonsignificant with no associated
   dysrhythmia: Two resolved over time without intervention, and one
   resolved with decrease in quetiapine dosage. There were no episodes of
   extrapyramidal symptoms or neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Conclusions:
   In this population of critically ill youth, short-term use of quetiapine
   as treatment for delirium appears to be safe, without serious adverse
   events. Further research is required to assess efficacy and evaluate for
   long-term effects. A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study
   of quetiapine in managing pediatric delirium is necessary.}},

Abstract = {{The imaging finding of omental cake has been demonstrated in other
   modalities, such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and
   ultrasonography. However, to the best of our knowledge, the image
   presentation of omental cake on a routine kidney-ureter-bladder film has
   not been reported before in the literature.We presented a unique case of
   a 61-year-old woman, with known advanced cecal colon mucinous
   adenocarcinoma, presented to our institution with abdominal fullness,
   poor appetite, and decreased stool passage for 20 days. Physical
   examination was unremarkable, except distended abdomen. Subsequent study
   revealed massive post-pigtail catheter drainage ascites with a prominent
   soft-tissue mass-causing centralization and tethering of focally
   distended small bowel gas, suggestive of omental cake on plain
   radiograph. The imaging finding in plain radiograph corresponds to the
   findings in other imaging modalities, including abdominal sonography and
   computed tomography. The patient underwent subtotal colectomy and
   ileostomy during later courses of chemotherapy due to adhesion ileus and
   possible intraabdominal abscess, and pathologic study confirmed the
   diagnosis of cecal mucinous adenocarcinoma and peritoneal
   carcinomatosis.Although the image finding of omental cake on plain
   radiograph has never been described, this image finding is unique and
   should be recognized, as it may suggest the presence of omental cake
   when first identified in the emergency department from patients with
   abdominal distension and warrant further evaluation to evaluate the
   underlying cause.}},

Abstract = {{Shutdown dose rates for planned maintenance purposes is an active
   research field in ITER. In this work the radiation (neutron and gamma)
   cross-talk between ports in the most conservative case foreseen in ITER
   is investigated: the presence of a torus cryopump lower port, mostly
   empty for pumping efficiency reasons.
   There will be six of those ports: \#4, \#6, \#10, \#12, \#16 and \#18.
   The equatorial ports placed above them will receive a significant amount
   of additional radiation affecting the shutdown dose rates during in situ
   maintenance activities inside the cryostat, and particularly in the port
   interspace area. In this study a general situation to all the equatorial
   ports placed above torus cryopump lower ports is considered: a generic
   diagnostics equatorial port placed above the torus cryopump lower port
   (LP\#4). In terms of shutdown dose rates at equatorial port interspace
   after 10(6) s of cooling time, 405 mu Sv/h has been obtained, of which
   160 mu Sv/h (40\%) are exclusively due to radiation cross-talk from a
   torus cryopump lower port. Equatorial port activation due to only
   ``local neutrons{''} contributes 166 mu Sv/h at port interspace, showing
   that radiation cross-talk from such a lower port is a phenomenon
   comparable in magnitude to the neutron leakage though the equatorial
   port plug. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) to protect enzymatic
   peroxidase activity was determined for horseradish peroxidase (HRP),
   versatile peroxidase (VP), commercial Coprinus peroxidase (BP), and
   chloroperoxidase (CPO). The operational stability measured as the total
   turnover number was determined for the four peroxidases. The presence of
   PEG significantly increased the operational stability of VP and HRP up
   to 123 and 195 \%, respectively, and dramatically increased the total
   turnover number of BP up to 597 \%. Chloroperoxidase was not protected
   by PEG, which may be due to the different oxidation mechanism, in which
   the oxidation is mediated by hypochlorous ion instead of free radicals
   as in the other peroxidases. The presence of PEG does not protect the
   enzyme when incubated only in the presence of H2O2 without reducing
   substrate. The catalytic constants (k (cat)) are insensitive to the
   presence of PEG, suggesting that the protection mechanism is not due to
   a competition between the PEG and the substrate as electron donors. On
   the other hand, PEG showed to have a significant antioxidant capacity.
   Thus, we conclude that the protection mechanism for peroxidases of PEG
   is based in its antioxidant capacity with which it is able scavenge or
   drain radicals that are harmful to the protein.}},

   total scale had high , .95. The factors found for the Icelandic FAD were
   not as reliable as the original FAD. The discriminant validity showed
   that the clinical group scored higher (more dysfunctional) than the
   nonclinical group in most dimensions of both original FAD and the
   Icelandic FAD. The eight factors extracted in an EFA were different from
   the original factors.
   Discussion: The Icelandic FAD possesses good psychometric properties,
   although its factor structure differs from the original FAD. The results
   are promising and merit continued application.}},

Abstract = {{The shape of catalysts has been regarded as a crucial physical factor to
   determine its catalytic activity in various applications. However, very
   little is known about the catalyst shape dependent activities for oxygen
   reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the
   cathode of Li-O-2 battery. Hence, we synthesized Pt3Co nanocube (NC) for
   the comparison with Pt3Co nanoparticle (NP) by regulating the ratio of
   reducer (hexadecanediol; HDD) amount. Consequently, we could report on
   very high capacity (10,000 mA h g(carbon)(-1)), superb rate capability
   (3500 mA h g(caribon)(-1) at 2000 mA g(caribon)(-1)) and high
   reversibility of Lithium-O-2 batteries using Pt3Co NC catalysts.
   Particularly, the Pt3Co NCs catalyst exhibited a low OER potential of
   3.1 V, providing the highest round trip efficiency of similar to 86.5\%
   at a current density of 200 mA g(caribon)(-1) which is much superior to
   NPs catalyst. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The selective oxidation of cyclooctene with tert-butylhydroperoxide
   (TBHP) was studied over Cu-containing MOFs at 348 K in liquid toluene.
   With Cu-3(BTC)(2), complete conversion was achieved after 120 h. The
   epoxide selectivity steadily increases to >80\%. The conversion is
   accelerated by a radical initiator and decelerated by a radical
   inhibitor. A radical-based mechanism is proposed with alkoxy- or
   polyperoxides being formed as intermediates to the epoxide. The
   comparison of the cyclooctene conversion with TBHP over Cu-3(BTC)(2)
   with FeBTC, the ion-exchanged zeolites Na,Cu-Y and Na,Fe-Y and TS-1
   proves that Cu-3(BTC)(2) is active for radicals generation from TBHP,
   but less suitable for catalyzing alkene epoxidation. The two recently
   reported Cu-MOFs 3(infinity){[}Cu (Me - 4py - trz - ia)] and
   3(infinity){[}Cu-4(mu(4) - O)(mu(2) - OH)(2) (Me(2)trz - pba)(4)] are up
   to four times more active for cyclooctene oxidation than Cu-3(BTC)(2).
   This was attributed to the specific coordination geometry of the
   catalytically active Cu sites within these materials. Moreover, the
   liquid-phase conversion of cyclooctene with TBHP is shown to be a
   sensitive test reaction to evaluate the potential of new solid oxidation
   catalysts, especially of transition metal-containing MOFs. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Background and objective: In Lithuania, hospitalization was planned to
   be reduced with the approval of the national healthcare restructuring
   program. The aim of this study was to describe regional inequalities of
   hospitalization and hospital morbidity in Lithuania and to associate
   them with mortality in the regions.
   Materials and methods: Routine hospital discharge data of Lithuanian
   hospitals, reimbursed by the Compulsory Health Insurance Fund and
   registered in database SVEIDRA, was used. Age-adjusted general
   hospitalization and hospital morbidity rates (per 1000 population) due
   to cardiovascular diseases (CVD), malignant neoplasms and external
   causes were calculated. Contribution of diseases, causing major public
   health problems, to general hospitalization was evaluated by analysis of
   components. Association of general hospitalization or hospital morbidity
   and mortality of respective causes was evaluated using non-parametric
   Spearman correlation.
   Results: General hospitalization and hospital morbidity of CVD,
   malignant neoplasms and external causes had increased from 2005 to 2011.
   Inequalities of hospitalization and hospital morbidity existed between
   regions of Lithuania. In Siauliai, Klaipeda, Utena and Panevezys
   regions, general hospitalization remained higher than national level. In
   Marijampole, Alytus and Kaunas regions, general hospitalization became
   lower than Lithuanian average. There was no statistically significant
   correlation between variation in hospitalization and mortality rates in
   the regions.
   Conclusions: Despite national efforts to decrease hospital care, our
   study detected the failure of hospitalization reduction and revealed an
   increase of hospitalization with the existing regional inequalities in
   Lithuania. (C) 2015 Lithuanian University of Health Sciences. Production

   hydrodistillation. They were examined by capillary GC and GC-MS. The
   chemical constituents were identified by comparison of their mass
   spectral data with those from the Wiley library, their retention indices
   and co-injection with the authentic samples. A total of 50 compounds
   representing 89.5\% of the essential oil content were identified from
   the fresh stem bark of G. ridleyi. The fresh stem bark oil was dominated
   by linalool (15.2\%) and citronellal (10.9\%). A total of 47 compounds
   representing 90.1\% of the total oil were identified from fresh stem of
   G. ridleyi, with the major compounds identified as beta-eudesmol
   (27.1\%) and gamma-eudesmol (20.8\%). The fruit oil contain 49
   identified compounds representing 89.8\% of total oil with the major
   constituents identified as beta-cubebene (20.7\%) and elemol (20.2\%).
   The chemical constituent in the fresh sample were similar to the

Journal = {{WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{226}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The aim of the research was to compare the effects of various petroleum
   products, biodiesel, diesel oil, fuel oil and unleaded petrol on soil
   dehydrogenases, and to evaluate biostimulation with compost and urea in
   the restoration of homeostasis of the soil contaminated with these
   products. The obtained results allowed for defining the weight of
   dehydrogenases in monitoring of the environment subjected to pressure
   from petroleum hydrocarbons. The studies were carried out under
   laboratory conditions for 180 days, and loamy sand was the soil
   formation used in the experiment. The petroleum products were used in
   the following amounts: 0, 2, 4, 8 and 16 g kg(-1) DM of soil. Indices of
   the influence of the petroleum product and the stimulating substance on
   the activity of dehydrogenases were calculated. It was proved that the
   petroleum products affect soil dehydrogenases in various ways.
   Biodiesel, diesel oil and fuel oil stimulate these enzymes, while petrol
   acts as an inhibitor. Among the substances tested regarding
   biostimulation of soils contaminated with petroleum products, compost is
   definitely more useful than urea, and therefore, the former should be
   used for the remediation of such soils. Stimulation of dehydrogenases by
   compost, both in contaminated and non-contaminated soils, proves that it
   may accelerate microbiological degradation of petroleum-derived
   contaminants.}},

   depends on the handwriting word level, and it does not need for
   character segmentation stage. An Arabic handwriting dataset AHDB,
   dataset used for train and test the proposed system. Besides, the system
   achieved the best recognition accuracy 96.317\% based on several feature
   extraction methods and SVM classifier. Experimental results show that
   the polynomial kernel of SVM is convergent and more accurate for
   recognition than other SVM kernels.}},

Abstract = {{Preformed plasma channels with parabolic radial density profiles enable
   the extended and stable optical guiding of high-intensity laser pulses.
   High-voltage discharge capillaries, commonly used for channel formation,
   have limited guiding length and opaque walls, complicating the diagnosis
   of the plasma within. This paper proposes a free-space gas channel
   produced by the collision of several gas flows. The collision of the gas
   flows forms an on-axis density depression surrounded by higher density
   walls. By offsetting the flows, we demonstrated the creation of what we
   believe is a novel vortex structure that exhibits a long-lived parabolic
   density profile. Once ionized, the resulting plasma density profile has
   a near-parabolic dependence appropriate for guiding. We then performed
   detailed two-dimensional (2D) fluid dynamics simulations to examine the
   properties and stability of the guiding structure. (C) 2015 Optical

Abstract = {{Though the WTO agreement of safeguards prohibits VERs, INTO members can
   still use VERs without formal intergovernmental agreements. Our
   theoretical analysis shows that the fear of invoking a safeguard measure
   by an importing country on a good can induce a disruptive exporter of
   the good to enforce such a VER under certain conditions (for example, if
   the number of exporting country is not large). Our empirical analysis,
   using Japan's first safeguard actions as a case study, suggests that if
   producers of an exporting country capture an export market and if there
   is a large drop in their export price, the producers seeing a growing
   threat of safeguards will enforce such VERs. Our results highlight the
   need for amendments to the INTO Agreement on Safeguards. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Three kinds of alkylamide amine oxides having one, two, and three amides
   were synthesized, and their solution properties such as the surface
   tension and the viscosity were examined. The effects of the spacer group
   length n between amide and dimethyamine oxide group as well as the
   number of amide groups were examined with respect to the aggregation
   behavior. For short spacer lengths, amide groups join the hydrophilic
   head group, while for long spacer lengths, amide groups and a part of
   the spacer groups are suggested to reside in the micelle palisade layer.
   In a series of amphiphile having three amide groups, gels formed at a
   high concentration of 50 mM were tentatively grouped into two types: A
   and B, depending on the spacer length n. For Gel-A, the gelling
   temperature T (gel) increased linearly with n but it was scarcely
   affected by the protonation of amine oxide (AO) group. For Gel-A,
   fiber-like aggregates were observed in cryo-TEM images. For Gel-B,
   values of T (gel) were higher by 18 +/- 2 K than those of Gel-A for a
   given n. Cryo-TEM images of Gel-B showed wide ribbon-like aggregates. On
   ionization of AO group, Gel-B transformed into Gel-A.}},

   views that by their very nature make sincere communication impossible.
   The second paradox belongs to a family of paradoxes in which an act of

Abstract = {{This study of perceived stress and communication networks fills 2
   theoretical gaps in the literature: First, drawing predominantly on
   conservation of resource theory and faultline theory, we demonstrate the
   role of stress as an `` engine of action{''} in network evolution.
   Second, we extend the stress literature to the interpersonal domain by
   arguing that others' levels of stress influence the individual's
   communication network, and this, in turn, changes his or her stress
   level. At 3 time points, we evaluated the communication ties and
   perceived stress in a unique field setting comprising 115 male
   participants (in 6 groups) performing group-based tasks. We introduce
   stochastic actor-based models for the coevolution of network ties and
   actor attributes, statistical models that enable causal inferences to be
   drawn regarding the interplay between dynamic networks and individual
   attributes. Using these models, we find that over time, individuals
   experiencing higher levels of perceived stress were less likely to
   create new communication ties and were more likely to maintain existing
   ties to others. Participants also tended to communicate with similarly
   stressed others. Such communication network dynamics further increased
   individuals' levels of perceived stress over time, leading to
   stress-related vicious cycles. We discuss organizational implications
   that relate to stress and network-related interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases (PPIases) catalyze the
   rate-limiting protein folding step at peptidyl bonds preceding proline
   residues and were found to be involved in several biological processes,
   including gene expression, signal transduction, and protein secretion.
   Representative enzymes were found in almost all sequenced genomes,
   including Corynebacterium glutamicum, a facultative anaerobic
   Gram-positive and industrial workhorse for the production of amino
   acids. In C. glutamicum, a predicted single-domain FK-506 (tacrolimus)
   binding protein (FKBP)-type PPIase (FkpA) is encoded directly downstream
   of gltA, which encodes citrate synthase (CS). This gene cluster is also
   present in other Actinobacteria. Here we carried out in vitro and in
   vivo experiments to study the function and influence of predicted FkpA
   in C. glutamicum. In vitro, FkpA indeed shows typical PPIase activity
   with artificial substrates and is inhibited by FK-506. Furthermore, FkpA
   delays the aggregation of CS, which is also inhibited by FK-506.
   Surprisingly, FkpA has a positive effect on the activity and temperature
   range of CS in vitro. Deletion of fkpA causes a 50\% reduced biomass
   yield compared to that of the wild type when grown at 37 degrees C,
   whereas there is only a 10\% reduced biomass yield at the optimal growth
   temperature of 30 degrees C accompanied by accumulation of 7
   mML-glutamate and 22 mM 2-oxoglutarate. Thus, FkpA may be exploited for
   improved product formation in biotechnical processes. Comparative
   transcriptome analysis revealed 69 genes which exhibit >= 2-fold mRNA
   level changes in C. glutamicum Delta fkpA, giving insight into the
   transcriptional response upon mild heat stress when FkpA is absent.}},

Abstract = {{Intermediate couplers have been shown to increase the coupling from
   primary to secondary pads in inductive power transfer (IPT) systems.
   This paper investigates embedding a coplanar intermediate coupler coil
   with the primary coil inside the primary pad to boost the coupling to
   the secondary pad and improve the efficiency of the system. Several coil
   designs are simulated and a mathematical model is developed to evaluate
   the efficiency of parallel-parallel and series-series tuned systems. As
   shown a coplanar, independently tuned intermediate coupler coil improves
   the efficiency of a series-series-tuned system since it reduces source
   losses. However, there appears to be no benefit to having an
   intermediate coupler with a parallel-parallel-tuned system. Furthermore,
   boosts in coupling are a result of adding extra current carrying
   windings to the primary pad and simulations show that operating the
   system as a traditional two coil IPT system may be simpler and more
   effective based on tuning topology. An experimental system was
   constructed to validate the simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus) is an aerobic
   gram-positive coccus that causes infections ranging from non-invasive
   pharyngitis to severely invasive necrotizing fasciitis. Mutations in
   csrS/csrR and rgg, negative regulator genes of group A streptococcus,
   are crucial factors in the pathogenesis of streptococcal toxic shock
   syndrome, which is a severe, invasive infection characterized by sudden
   onset of shock and multiorgan failure, resulting in a high mortality
   rate. Here we present a case of group A streptococcal bacteremia in a
   28-year-old Japanese woman with no relevant previous medical history.
   The patient developed progressive abdominal symptoms that may have been
   due to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, followed by a state of shock,
   which did not fulfill the proposed criteria for streptococcal toxic
   shock. The isolate was found to harbor a mutation in the negative
   regulator csrS gene, whereas the csrR and rgg genes were intact. It was
   noteworthy that this strain carrying a csrS mutation had caused group A
   streptococcal bacteremia characterized by acute abdomen as the
   presenting symptom in a young individual who had been previously
   healthy. This case indicates that group A streptococcus with csrS
   mutations has potential virulence factors that are associated with the
   onset of group A streptococcal bacteremia that does not meet the
   diagnostic criteria for streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. (C) 2015,
