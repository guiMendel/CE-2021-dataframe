Abstract = {{The intramolecular zirconocene coupling of
   4,4-bis(hexyloxymethyl)-1,7-bis-p-halophenyl-1,6-heptadiynes provides
   2,5-bis-p-halophenylzirconocyclopentadienes (bromo and chloro
   derivatives), which undergo efficient transmetalation reactions with
   GeBr(4). Methylation of the resulting dihalogermoles with MeLi provided
   bis-p-halophenyl-2,5-germole monomers. These functionalized germoles
   were polymerized via nickel coupling to give oligo- and
   poly(2,5-diphenylgermole) materials (7). Investigations of optical
   properties reveal that the monomers and a model 2,5-bisphenylgermole are
   somewhat photoluminescent (Phi = 0.018-0.12), while the high molecular
   weight polymer (M(n) approximate to 20 000) exhibits very efficient
   photoemission (Phi = 0.79). Electrochemical studies indicate that
   delocalization in 7 is accompanied by a modest lowering of the LUMO
   level relative to that of the monomer.}},

Abstract = {{The GTPase dynamin is essential for receptor-mediated endocytosis, but
   its function remains controversial,A domain of dynamin, termed the
   GTPase effector domain (GED), controls dynamin's high stimulated rates
   of GTP hydrolysis by functioning as an assembly-dependent GAP.
   Dyn(K694A) and dyn(R725A) carry point mutations within GED resulting in
   reduced assembly stimulated GTPase activity Biotinylated transferrin is
   more rapidly sequestered from avidin in cells transiently overexpressing
   either of these two activating mutants (Sever, S.,A.B. Muhlberg, and
   S.L. Schmid. 1999. Nature. 398:481-486), suggesting that early events in
   receptor-mediated endocytosis are accelerated. Using stage-specific
   assays and morphological analyses of stably transformed cells, we have
   identified which events in clathrin-coated vesicle formation are
   accelerated by the overexpression of dyn(K694A) and dyn(R725A). Both
   mutants accelerate the formation of constricted coated pits, which we
   identify as the rate limiting step in endocytosis. Surprisingly,
   overexpression of dyn(R725A), whose primary defect is in stimulated GTP
   hydrolysis, but not dyn(K694A), whose primary defect is in
   self-assembly, inhibited membrane fission leading to coated vesicle
   release. Together, our data support a model in which dynamin functions
   like a classical GTPase as a key regulator of clathrin-mediated
   endocytosis.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a key role for the CD44 transmembrane glycoprotein in
   Schwann cell-neuron interactions. CD44 proteins have been implicated in
   cell adhesion and in the presentation of growth factors to high affinity
   receptors. We observed high CD44 expression in early rat neonatal nerves
   at times when Schwann cells proliferate but low expression in adult
   nerves, where CD44 was found in some nonmyelinating Schwann cells and to
   varying extents in some myelinating fibers. CD44 constitutively
   associated with erbB2 and erbB3, receptor tyrosine kinases that
   heterodimerize and signal in Schwann cells in response to neuregulins.
   Moreover, CD44 significantly enhanced neuregulin-induced erbB2
   phosphorylation and erbB2-erbB3 heterodimerization. Reduction of CD44
   expression in vitro resulted in loss of Schwann cell-neurite adhesion
   and Schwann cell apoptosis, CD44 is therefore crucial for maintaining
   neuron-Schwann cell interactions at least partly by facilitating
   neuregulin-induced erbB2-erbB3 activation.}},

Abstract = {{The role played by the ceramides (Cer) in the interaction of Triton
   X-100 (TX-100) with liposomes modeling the stratum corneum (SC) lipid
   composition was studied. The surfactant/lipid molar ratios (Re) and the
   bilayer/aqueous phase partition coefficients (K) were determined at
   sublytic level by monitoring the changes in the fluorescence intensity
   of liposomes due to the 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (CF) released from the
   interior of vesicles. Higher and lower Cer proportions than those
   existing in the SC (40\%) led respectively to a fall and to a rise in
   the surfactant ability to alter these liposomes. However, the surfactant
   partitioning between bilayers and water (bilayer affinity with vesicles)
   exhibited a maximum for 40\% Cer. Thus, at low Cer proportions the
   ability of TX-100 molecules to alter these bilayers was maximum despite
   their reduced partitioning into bilayers, in line with the reported
   interaction of the anionic surfactant model sodium dodecyl sulfate with
   these vesicles. These findings underline the fragility of these bilayers
   as an effective barrier and could explain in part the reported
   dependencies of low level of Cer in skin lipids and function barrier
   abnormalities. The fact that the free surfactant concentration needed to
   achieve the two interaction levels investigated was lower than the
   surfactant CMC indicates that permeability alterations were mainly ruled
   by the action of surfactant monomers, regardless of Cer proportion in
   bilayers. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{NMR imaging has been used to study the release behavior of two model
   drugs, triflupromazine-HCl and 5-fluorouracil, from swelling
   hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) tablets. Preliminary experiments
   were performed on equilibrium mixtures of drug, polymer and water to
   determine how properties such as NMR relaxation parameters and
   self-diffusion were affected by the drug and polymer concentrations. The
   tablet swelling was restricted to one dimension and distributions of the
   water and model drugs were obtained by H-1 and F-19 imaging,
   respectively. The HPMC distribution at each time in the swelling process
   was determined indirectly from its effect on the relaxation parameters
   of the water and the drugs. In the one-dimensional swelling tablet,
   distributions of drug and polymer were compared to determine what
   factors influenced the release of drug from the swelling tablet. The
   distributions for triflupromazine-HCl and HPMC paralleled each other and
   the drug was only released at the eroding edge of the tablet where the
   HPMC concentration dropped below 10\%. In contrast, 5-fluorouracil was
   released much more rapidly from the tablet and appeared to escape by
   diffusion from regions as high as 30\% HPMC. An empirical measure of the
   rate of tablet edge movement can be obtained from plots of the edge
   position as a function of the square root of time. For HPMC, the rate of
   tablet expansion was determined in this way to be (2.4+/-0.8)x10(-6)
   cm(2) s(-1). The self-diffusion of triflupromazine-HCl in equilibrated
   mixtures of similar composition to the eroding tablet edge is similar to
   3x10(-6) cm(2) s(-1) while the self-diffusion coefficient of
   5-fluorouracil remained higher than this value until the HPMC
   concentration reached about 30\%. This comparison of `diffusion'
   properties may be useful in predicting the mechanism of drug release
   from other swelling hydrophilic matrix systems. (C) 2000 Elsevier

   performed with ions from a precursor gas mixture of nitrogen and
   methane. IBAD has permitted to cover a wide range of compositions as a
   function of deposition parameters. The film growth rate presents a
   voltage threshold for the CNx films and a current threshold for the BCN
   films. The stoichiometry of the BCN films seems to be confined to two
   regions, depending of whether methane is included or not in the gas
   feed. The film composition turns towards the more stable arrangement,
   i.e. BN and B4C, as the gas mixture is enriched in nitrogen or methane,
   respectively. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In situ Reflectance Difference Spectroscopy (RDS) was performed during
   p-type of nitrogen-doped ZnTe thin films grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy
   (MBE). The MBE system is equipped with an electron cyclotron resonance
   (ECR) cell for N-plasma generation. The RDS system is attached via a
   strain-free fused silica viewport mounted for normal incidence. This
   allows us to take RD spectra during the doping process in the range from
   1.5 to 5.5 eV. The doping level of the ZnTe:N films was determined in
   situ by evaluating the RD spectra in the vicinity of the E-1 and E-1 +
   Delta (1) transitions. This spectral range was used to get the optimum
   conditions in the online doping performance of the plasma cell. We
   varied cell parameters like N-pressure and input r.f. power.
   Furthermore, we investigated doping-induced surface processes, like
   surface saturation with activated N-species. Finally, ex situ measured
   spectra are compared with in situ acquired data, in order to study the
   surface Fermi level pinning at ambient pressures. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background Air pollution contributes to mortality and morbidity. We
   estimated the impact of outdoor (total) and traffic-related air
   pollution on public health in Austria, France, and Switzerland.
   Attributable cases of morbidity and mortality were estimated.
   Methods Epidemiology-based exposure-response functions for a 10 mu
   g/m(3) increase in particulate matter (PM10) were used to quantify the
   effects of air pollution. Cases attributable to air pollution were
   estimated for mortality (adults greater than or equal to 30 years),
   respiratory and cardiovascular hospital admissions tall ages), incidence
   of chronic bronchitis (adults greater than or equal to 25 years),
   bronchitis episodes in children (<15 years), restricted activity days
   (adults greater than or equal to 20 years), and asthma attacks in adults
   and children. Population exposure (PM10) was modelled for each km(2).
   The traffic-related fraction was estimated based on PM10 emission
   inventories.
   Findings Air pollution caused 6\% of total mortality or more than 40 000
   attributable cases per year. About half of all mortality caused by air
   pollution was attributed to motorised traffic, accounting also for: more
   than 25 000 new cases of chronic bronchitis (adults); more than 290 000
   episodes of bronchitis (children); more than 0.5 million asthma attacks;
   and more than 16 million person-days of restricted activities.
   Interpretation This assessment estimates the public-health impacts of
   current patterns of air pollution. Although individual health risks of
   air pollution are relatively small, the public-health consequences are
   considerable. Traffic-related air pollution remains a key target for
   public-health action in Europe. Our results, which have also been used
   for economic valuation, should guide decisions on the assessment of
   environmental health-policy options.}},

Abstract = {{The structure of N-2-fixing nodules of faba bean (Vicia faba L.) was
   investigated by means of light and electron microscopy to determine
   possible pathways for metabolite movement. The central infected zone is
   enclosed by a cortex, which is composed of a loosely arranged outer part
   and a densely packed inner part. Both are separated by the nodule
   endodermis, which borders on the root endodermis and continuously
   envelopes the entire nodule interior, with the exception of the apical
   meristematic region. Vascular bundles, located peripherally within the
   inner cortex, are surrounded by another endodermal layer. Radial cell
   wails of both nodule and vascular endodermis are incrusted and form
   Casparian bands. Additionally all endodermal cells are coated by suberin
   lamellae. These modifications may prevent an apoplastic loss of solutes
   from the enclosed tissues, and require a symplastic metabolite passage,
   This is supported by high plasmodesmatal frequencies found between
   vascular endodermis and inner cortex. Within vascular bundles, transfer
   cells adjacent to xylem elements may play a role in xylem loading. The
   central infected tissue contains uninfected cells, possibly representing
   a symplastic continuity, These cells may form a preferred metabolite
   pathway since plasmodesmata are extremely sparse between infected cells.
   The low number of uninfected cells in the central tissue of L! faba
   nodules favors an additional apoplastic pathway.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The objective of this study was to assess different smoking
   patterns during and after pregnancy and relate these patterns to
   socioeconomic conditions and different health issues such as symptoms,
   drug consumption and health care use. Methods: The study group included
   337 pregnant women from a district in south Sweden. A questionnaire was
   filled in during the first part of pregnancy and an interview was
   conducted after the baby was born. The women were categorised according
   to their smoking habits. Results: The categories defined were
   continuers, relapsers, decreasers, quitters and non-smokers. Among
   relapsers three symptoms, difficulty in relaxing (OR 4.48), restlessness
   (OR 9.59) and dysphoria (OR 3.98), were more common than among
   non-smokers. All three musculoskeletal symptoms were most common among
   continuers. Among quitters the OR for backache was 2.05, for numbness in
   the arms and legs 2.76 and for tearfulness 2.92. Educational level was
   relatively high among quitters and few had a smoking partner. Among
   smokers (decreasers, relapsers and continuers) 24\% used drugs
   regularly, compared to 5\% among non-smokers. Conclusions: To prevent
   smoking during pregnancy awareness of the relations between different
   smoking categories and symptoms could make it easier for health
   personnel to individualise support. A possible starting point is to
   discuss how to cope with different symptoms occurring during smoking
   cessation. Women with predictors for continued smoking during pregnancy,
   such as low education, unemployment, a smoking partner and multiparous,
   should be focused on more intensively and preventive strategies suitable
   for their special needs should be developed.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of dosing time on the anticoagulant activity of
   unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin (nadroparin) and
   danaproid were investigated. The chrono pharmacological comparisons of
   the drugs were done on the anti-Xa, anti-IIa activities and activated
   partial thromboplastin time assays. Several dosing times were considered
   and an analysis based on a population approach was adopted. Under
   unfractionated heparin, the pharmacological activities did not exhibit
   significant daily variations. In contrast, significant daily profiles
   were observed in all the biological assays performed with low molecular
   weight heparin. Anti-Xa and anti-IIa activities showed some fluctuations
   over a 24-hour period with a peak at noon. As for the variations of the
   activated partial thromboplastin time, two peaks were noted early in the
   morning and at the beginning of nightfall. As for danaproid, only a
   daytime maximum of anti-Xa activity could be found. Copyright (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Optical gap solitons refer to nonlinear waves propagating in optical
   fibers whose linear refractive index has a periodic variation.
   Stationary gap solitons came to light first in 1987 {[}Chen and Mills,

   Christodoulides and Joseph {[}Phys. Rev. Lett. 62, 1746 (1989)] and are
   first extended to a more general traveling wave form in Aceves and
   Wabnitz {[}Phys. Lett. A 141, 37 (1989)]. But it was not until seven
   years later, that the first experimental demonstration {[}Eggleton ,
   Phys. Rev. Lett. 76, 1627 (1996); J. Opt. Soc. Am. B 14, 2980 (1997)]
   was reported. Since then, there has been an increase in the study of the

Abstract = {{Objective: To assess which mental health therapists use bibliotherapy,
   their reasons for doing so, and rationale for recommending specific
   titles. To review the book selected most often in several categories,
   using prepublished criteria for reviewers of self-help hooks.
   Method: We sent a survey to all therapists in a Northern Ontario
   community requesting information on therapist demographics, the
   respondent's practice, the use of bibliotherapy and derails of the book
   most often prescribed in various categories.
   Results: Of 112 surveys, 62 were returned for a response rate of 55\%.
   Sixty-eight percent of respondents indicated that they used
   bibliotherapy. The most common reason for recommending books was to
   encourage self-help. There was a significant relation between greater
   counselling experience and increased the of bibliotherapy. Three of the
   5 books reviewed were based on empirical theory; only 1 met all the
   guidelines.
   Conclusion: Most thearapists recommend books to their clients, but there
   is little empirical evidence of efficacy. Counsellors should review the
   books recommended and discuss them with the client. Client opinion
   should be solicited and effectiveness measured.}},

Abstract = {{Denitrification rates in aquatic sediments from three sites upland of
   high salinity estuaries were measured to compare nitrate (NO3-) removal
   by sediment bacteria. The study sites included two blackwater creeks
   that drain to coastal inlets tone in an undeveloped coastal forest and
   the second in a suburban residential development) and a drainage pond on
   a golf course. Two to 20 mmol NO3- kg(-1) soil was added to microcosms
   and the acetylene block technique was used to estimate denitrification.
   Nitrate, nitrous oxide (N2O) and ammonium (NH4+) concentrations were
   monitored over time. The rate and efficiency of denitrification was low
   at the 2 mmol NO3- kg(-1) addition and increased proportionally with
   NO3- added. Across all treatments, the golf course sediment that
   received consistent N inputs in situ had the most rapid and greatest N2O
   production, while the salt marsh in the undeveloped area had the least.
   The NH4+ concentrations remained constant and low (2 mmol N kg(-1))
   except at the undeveloped, forested Oyster Creek (8 mmol NH4+-N kg(-1)).
   In most cases, the majority of NO3- removal did not occur until 24 to 48
   h of incubation, regardless of N2O production. During typical low- and
   no-now periods, this time frame may be adequate for slow diffusion of
   nutrients and removal of NO3- prior to transport to coastal estuaries or
   ground water, particularly at the gulf course site. However, this time
   frame may not be adequate during rapid water and nutrient transport due
   to severe storm events typical of this region.}},

Abstract = {{Three decades of feminist academic work have led to claims about its
   maturity and ``coming of age{''}. This article offers a critical
   evaluation of feminism's success, particularly in the context of
   ``race{''} and ethnicity awareness. Feminism has challenged mainstream
   thought by making women and gender central concerns, by opening up new
   fields for study and by breaking down disciplinary barriers. However,
   the global hegemony of Western feminism means that the range of women's
   issues tends to be narrowly and parochially conceived. Women of
   different ethnicities have had an uphill struggle to redefine feminist
   terms, benchmarks and understandings. One particular difficulty involves
   the use of ideas and concepts which are not easily translated into
   English. Drawing on debates between Western women and Islamist
   feminists, the article explores some of the problems in understanding
   terminologies and deciphering definitions about cultures and languages.
   It argues that the views of non-Western and ethnic minority women must
   be moved from margin to centre stage.}},

Abstract = {{The temporal overlap of 1.69-1.55 Ga westward growth of the Baltic
   Shield and voluminous, episodic, 1.65-1.50 Ga rapakivi magmatism in the
   Svecofennian domain to the east has long been recognized. New U-Pb data
   from southwest Sweden indicate that this westward growth occurred in at
   least three distinct stages involving convergent-margin magmatism
   (Gothian orogenesis) at 1.69-1.65, 1.62-1.58, and 1.56-1.55 Ga. This
   improved resolution along the margin reveals an interesting temporal
   correlation between these events and the intracratonic rapakivi
   magmatism. Each stage of convergent-margin magmatism was echoed by a
   phase of bimodal rapakivi magmatism at 1.65-1.62, 1.58-1.56, and
   1.55-1.50 Ga. In addition to this temporal correlation, rapakivi suites
   form distinct north-trending arrays that are subparallel to, but
   500-1500 km east of, the active margin. These temporal and spatial links
   suggest that recurring subduction along oceanward-stepping zones
   provided first-order control(s) on episodic mantle melting and
   consequent bimodal rapakivi magmatism in distal, inboard settings. At
   the very least, emerging constraints from Baltica do not support
   previous, purely anorogenic models for the 1.65-1.50 Ga rapakivi
   magmatism or models that singularly implicate lingering effects from the
   preceding Svecofennian orogeny.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of aging on the microstructure and shear strength of
   62Sn36Pb2Ag/ Ni-P/Cu and SnAg/Ni-P/Cu surface mount solder joints was
   investigated. An intermetallic (IMC) layer of Ni,Sn, forms at the
   interface between both solders and the Ni-P barrier layer and it
   thickens with aging time, with a decrease in the thickness of remaining
   Ni-P layer. The SnAg solder joint initially has a greater shear force
   than that of SnPbAg, but it drops dramatically after 250 h aging, and
   fracture occurs at the Ni-P/Cu interface afterwards, although it
   initiates in the solder in the initial stage of aging. The fracture in
   SnAg solder joint may arise from the excessive depletion of Ni
   characterized by a rapid accumulation of P in the remaining Ni-P layer,
   which results in a poor adhesion between the Ni-P layer and the Cu
   substrate. However, for the SnPbAg solder joint, the shear force
   initially decreases rapidly then asymptotically approaches a minimum,
   and fracture occurs from inside solder toward the solder/Ni-P interface.
   SnPbAg solder joint keeps relatively higher shear strength compared to
   SnAg solder joint after long term aging even though it decreases with
   aging time.}},

Abstract = {{Igf2 and H19 are closely linked and reciprocally expressed genes on
   distal chromosome 7 in the mouse. We have previously shown that a 130 kb
   YAC transgene contains multiple tissue-specific enhancers for expression
   of both genes during embryogenesis. The YAC also contains all the
   crucial elements responsible for initiating and maintaining appropriate
   parent-of-origin-specific expression of these genes at ectopic sites,
   with expression of Igf2 after paternal inheritance and of H19 after
   maternal inheritance. Located centrally between Igf2 and H19 are two
   prominent DNaseI hypersensitive sites, and two stretches of sequence
   that are conserved between mouse and human. In this study, we have
   deleted, from the transgene, a one kb part of the intergenic region that
   contains the hypersensitive sites and one of the homologous stretches.
   We demonstrate that this deletion results in loss of maternal Igf2
   repression in skeletal muscle cells, most strikingly in the tongue, late
   in embryogenesis. We propose that the intergenic region functions as a
   tissue-specific repressor element, forming an integral part of the
   complex regulatory mechanism that controls monoallelic gene expression
   in this domain.}},

Abstract = {{Recombinant Autographa californica multiple nuclear polyhedrosis viruses
   (AcMNPV) have recently been shown to transduce mammalian cells in vitro.
   Since baculoviruses offer many advantages over viruses currently used in
   gene therapy we have tested them for in vivo gene transfer by
   constructing a baculovirus bearing a nuclear targeted beta-galactosidase
   marker gene (LacZ) under a CMV promoter. Both rabbit aortic smooth
   muscle cells (RAASMC) and human EGV-304 cells were susceptible to
   LacZ-baculovirus transduction. Transgene expression was evaluated in
   vivo by applying 1 x 10(9) p.f.u. of LacZ-baculoviruses or
   LacZ-adenoviruses in a silastic collar placed around rabbit carotid
   arteries in the absence of contact with blood components. As a result,
   baculoviruses led to transgene expression in adventitial cells in rabbit
   carotid arteries with efficiency comparable to adenoviruses. The
   beta-galactosidase gene expression was transient staying at a high level
   for 1 week but disappearing at the 14 day time-point. The arterial
   structure and endothelium remained intact in the baculovirus-transduced
   arteries, but macrophage-specific immunostaining defected signs of
   inflammation comparable to adenoviruses. Baculoviruses are thus able to
   mediate transient gene transfer in vive and may become useful tools for
   gene therapy.}},

Abstract = {{A novel thermal-management system that incorporates phase-change
   material (PCM) is proposed and investigated for electric vehicle (EV)
   applications. A commercial finite-element (FE) software, PDEase2D(TM),
   was used to simulate the thermal behavior of EV battery modules with a
   PCM thermal management system. Simulation results show that the
   temperature profile of the cells integrated in the module design was
   substantially more uniform during discharge at different rates than
   without PCM. The PCM system is effective in thermally sensitive
   batteries such as Li-ion and most Li-polymer batteries with a
   significant reversible heat effect. The heat generated during discharge
   and stored as latent heat is then largely utilized during charge, and a
   smaller part of it is transferred to the surroundings. The stored heat
   will be rejected to the module when the battery is left to relax or when
   its temperature drops below the melting point of the PCM. This is an
   important advantage for EV operation under cold conditions or in space
   applications where the battery temperature drops significantly when an
   orbiting satellite moves from the light to the dark side of the earth.

Title = {{Geologic hazards of an embankment dam constructed across a major, active
   plate boundary fault}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL \& ENGINEERING GEOSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{353-382}},

Abstract = {{The geological structures associated with the site of the 55 million
   m(3) Karameh embankment dam constructed in the Jordan Valley and the
   tectonic effects on dam foundation and reservoir margins were reviewed.
   The dam crosses the strike-slip fault of the Jordan Valley Rift Zone.
   Trace evidence of the fault indicates a displacement of 8 to 15 m over a
   rupture length of some 130 km, which probably took place several
   centuries ago. Earthquakes with Richter magnitudes as great as 7.8 have
   occurred along the Jordan Valley Fault. Deterministic studies by
   Tapponnier (1992) indicated that the dam design should incorporate the
   possibility of a 7.8 event, a maximum horizontal rupture displacement on
   the fault of 10 m and a design peak ground acceleration (PGA) of 0.74 g
   at the site of the dam. These values are consistent with those which
   would be used in the USA for a similar case. However, the dam was
   actually designed by a consultant and constructed for a PGA of about a
   quarter of this value, based on seismic hazard analysis following
   guidelines of the International Committee on Large Dams (ICOLD) (1989).
   Moreover, the dam was designed for displacements of 6 m horizontal and 2
   m vertically Liquefiable sand layers were found in the dam foundation. A
   PGA of 0.50 g will trigger liquefaction of the sand layers in the dam
   foundation which would be expected to result in a crest settlement of
   4.4 m. Slope stability analysis indicated deep failure planes in the
   foundation zone. The excavation of loose materials from under the dam
   foundation has not precluded the possibility of liquefaction occurring
   under the expected earthquake. Field mapping of geological features
   during the dam foundation excavation and construction revealed that: a)
   the most likely location of the Jordan Valley Fault is in the area where
   the Wadi Mallaha stream crosses the dam axis, b) zones of en echelon
   type open fissures have been defined in the laminates sub-parallel to
   the Jordan Valley Fault Zone, c) at the Wadi Mallaha stream bed a
   parallel zone of faulting and warping of the Lisan Formation was
   identified, and d) the alignment is clearly confirmed by the exposure
   immediately upstream of the core at Ch 1375.
   The main wrench fault zone crosses the embankment footprint (upstream to
   downstream approximately) and reaches the surface around Ch 1375. The
   critical safety elements of the embankment are the core, the downstream
   fine filter, the chimney drain and the drainage blanket. To resist large
   earthquake events safely, the following safety measures should be
   implemented:
   1. A freeboard of 7.0 m instead of the 5.0 m constructed.
   2. The foundation of the dam should be stabilized against liquefaction.
   3. The embankment internal zoning should be designed to accommodate
   damage resulting from earthquake events,vith a magnitude of 7.8.
   4. The foundation needs relief measures downstream to lower the pore
   pressure.
   This paper describes the measures taken during construction as overall
   defense against future fault movements through a,vide plastic core, an
   extensive upstream blanket, a 5.0-m thick downstream chimney filter and
   drain zones, a 5-m freeboard and an upstream crack stopper zone which
   mag be critical for normal faults with a lateral extension component.
   The geological determination of the main wrench fault alignment resulted
   in the addition of an extra 2-m width to each of the already wide
   chimney filter and drain zones. In order to reduce potential seepage,
   local cut-off trenches or slush grouting were used for treatment of any
   open fissures at the upstream edge of the external blanket and the right
   bank ridge.
   The scale and scope of this dam and inherent engineering geological
   hazards are unprecedented. The design is considered deficient. This
   paper documents serious safety issues with the dam. The constructed dam
   presents serious safety risks and represents a case history of a
   disaster waiting to happen.}},

   patterns and rates of adrenocorticotropic hormone and its secretagogues
   in the horse}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Alpha-2-adrenoceptor activation may lower adrenocorticotropic hormone
   (ACTH) by reducing secretagogue input and/or increasing the release of
   an inhibitory factor (CIF). To investigate this, we gave clonidine, an
   alpha-2-agonist, to seven horses, and collected pituitary venous blood
   every minute for 20 min before treatment and 40 min after treatment. Six
   horses were given saline vehicle. Mean secretion rates of
   corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), arginine vasopressin (AVP) and
   ACTH were calculated before and during four 5-min then two 10-min
   periods after clonidine or saline. Reduction in ACTH secretion without
   corresponding changes in CRH and/or AVP would imply the presence of CIF.
   Secretion rates of ACTH (P = 0.008) and AVP (P = 0.0005) fell after
   clonidine and remained lower than baseline values for 20 min and 10 min,
   respectively. The CRH secretion rate decreased slightly but not
   significantly after clonidine. In controls, hormone secretion rates did
   not alter during the experiment. Multiple linear regression showed that
   CRH and AVP secretion accounted for 69\% (treated) or 45\% (controls) of
   the variation in ACTH secretion (P < 0.0001 for each). CRH alone
   contributed 80\% (treated) or 76\% (controls) of the fit to this model,
   which is consistent with the concept that CRH `sets the gain' of the
   response of corticotrophs to fluctuations in AVP. Accordingly,
   minute-to-minute changes in pituitary concentrations of AVP and ACTH
   were synchronous when all data were considered (\% concordant changes:
   controls, 68\%, P < 0.0001; treated, 76\%, P < 0.0001) and the
   percentage of concordant movement was unaffected by clonidine (before
   72\%; after 73\%; P = 0.80). In treated horses but not controls, the
   ratio between the secretion rates of ACTH and AVP fell (P = 0.009),
   while the ACTH : CRH ratio tended to fall after clonidine, implying
   reduced responsiveness to stimulation. Moreover, one horse showed a drop
   in ACTH and a rise in CRH and AVP secretion after clonidine. We conclude
   that in horses alpha-2-adrenoceptor activation lowers ACTH secretion
   primarily by reducing the secretion of AVP and possibly CRH. While there
   was some evidence that a CIF may participate in the clonidine-induced
   suppression of ACTH, the subtlety of the discordance between ACTH and
   its secretagogues in most horses and the rarity of complete dissociation
   indicate that it does not play a major role.}},

Abstract = {{This payer documents a series of methodological innovations that are
   relevant to macroevolutionary studies. The new methods are applied to
   updated faunal and body mass data sets for North American fossil
   mammals, documenting several key trends across the late Cretaceous and
   Cenozoic. The methods are (1) A maximum likelihood formulation of
   appearance event ordination. The reformulated criterion involves
   generating a maximally likely hypothesized relative ordering of first
   and last appearances (i.e., an age range chart). The criterion takes
   faunal occurrences, stratigraphic relationships, and the sampling
   probability of individual genera and species into account. (2) A
   nonparametric temporal interpolation method called ``shrink-wrapping{''}
   that makes it possible to employ the greatest possible number of tie
   points without violating monotonicity or allowing abrupt changes in
   slopes. The new calibration method is used in computing pro visional
   definitions of boundaries among North American land mammal ages. (3)
   Additional methods for randomized subsampling of faunal lists, one
   weighting the number of lists that have been drawn by the sum of the
   square of the number of occurrences in each list, and one further
   modifying this approach to account for long-term changes in average
   local species richness. (4) Foote's new equations for instantaneous
   speciation and extinction rates. The equations are rederived and used to
   generate time series, confirm that logistic dynamics result from the
   diversity dependence of speciation but not extinction, and define the
   median duration of species (i.e., 2.6 m.y, for Eocene-Pleistocene
   mammals). (5) A method employing the G likelihood ratio statistic that
   is used to quantify the volatility of changes in the relative proportion
   of species falling in each of several major taxonomic groups. (6)
   Univariate measures of body mass distributions based on ordinary moment
   statistics (mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis). These
   measures are favored over the method of cenogram analysis. Data are
   presented showing that even diverse individual fossil collections merely
   yield a noisy version of the same pattern seen in the overall
   continental data set. peaks in speciation rates, extinction rates,
   proportional volatility and shifts in body mass distributions occur at
   different times, suggesting that environmental perturbations do not have
   simple effects on the biota.}},

Abstract = {{The reaction of ethyl(Z)-N-(2-amino-1,2-dicyanovinyl)formimidate 6 with
   carbonyl compounds in the presence of triethylamine occurs with
   formation of the Schiffs base and intramolecular hydrolysis of the
   adjacent cyano group to give the alkylideneamino derivatives 8a-f. When
   the alpha -carbon of the ketone has at least one proton, the prolonged
   contact of 8a-f with triethylamine causes intramolecular cyclization
   between this carbon and the imidate carbon atom to form a seven membered
   ring. This is followed by cyclization of the cyano and amido groups,
   leading to the pyrrolo{[}4,3-b]{[}1,4]diazepines 9. If a strong base is
   used the first ring to be formed is the pyrrole ring as evidenced in the
   reaction of 8a with 1,8-diazabicyclo{[}5.4.0]undee-7-ene leading to 14.
   The subsequent addition of methyl amine to the reaction mixture, caused
   cleavage of the alkylideneamino unit and formation of the amidine
   function from the imidate (15). The addition of acid to the imidates 8a
   and 8f led to the diazepine compounds 10a and 10f respectively. A
   suspension of compound 8e in ethanol and triethylamine evolved to a
   pyrazinone structure 12 under kinetic conditions (4 hours, room
   temperature) and to the pyrrolo{[}4,3-b]{[}1,4]diazepine 9e under
   thermodynamic conditions (48 hours, room temperature).}},

Abstract = {{The influence of fasting prior to treatment on plasma availability and

   oral gel formulation of moxidectin at the manufacturers recommended

   the fasted animals compared to those fed their usual rations, It is
   suggested that fasting decreases intestinal transit time, and may have
   prolonged time for absorption of moxidectin. Since, biliary excretion
   and intestinal secretion are major routes of moxidectin elimination,
   fasting may have reduced bile flow and intestinal secretion, Easting
   before treatment may be a useful tool for improved anthelmintic
   treatment in horses.}},

Abstract = {{During the late Paleozoic Oslo rifting event, the SW part of the Baltic
   Shield was penetrated by mantle-derived magmas from a depleted
   lithospheric or sublithospheric source. Along the way to their final
   emplacement, these magmas may have interacted with a heterogeneous
   continental crust, consisting of a mosaic of continental terranes, each
   with its unique composition and internal crustal history. Information on
   radiogenic isotope ratios and trace element distributions in the
   Precambrian terranes surrounding the rift can be used to define
   characteristic crustal components. These components may be used as
   endmembers in petrogenetic modelling of the Oslo Rift magmatic system.
   Based on available data, six endmember components can be identified, and
   (semi) quantitatively characterized in terms of Sr, Nd and Pb isotopes
   and selected trace elements. Data on the distribution of rock-types
   along the rift flanks allow estimates to be made of the relative
   importance of the components in different parts of the rift. Combining
   these data with petrological information may allow a realistic
   understanding of crust-magma interaction in the Oslo Rift magmatic
   system. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Children and youth with emotional and behavioral disabilities often have
   multiple needs that can require the simultaneous Involvement of several
   child-serving agencies (e.g., child welfare, special education, juvenile
   justice, and mental health), Unfortunately, disparate definitions and
   eligibility criteria that are used to identify these disabilities have
   prevented agencies from collaborating or even communicating about the
   children with whom they work, resulting in a pervasive lack of
   coordination among service providers. During the past 15 years, however,
   there has been an increase in the number of multiagency, community-based
   programs for children and youth with emotional and behavioral
   disabilities, sometimes referred to as ``systems of care.{''} In this
   paper, information about commonly used federal definitions of emotional
   and behavioral disabilities and a description of how variance in
   definitions and eligibility criteria contributes to the inability of
   agencies to work together to meet the needs of children and families are
   presented. Additionally, methods for developing community-level,

Journal = {{ANATOMICAL RECORD}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{260}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{81-91}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{There have been suggestions made recently that our understanding of the
   atrioventricular junctions of the heart is less than adequate, with
   claims for several new findings concerning the arrangement of the
   ordinary working myocardium and the specialised pathways for
   atrioventricular conduction. In reality, these claims are grossly
   exaggerated. The structure and architecture of the pathways for
   conduction between the atrial and ventricular myocardium are exactly as
   described by Tawara nearly 100 years ago. The recent claims stem from a
   failure to assess histological findings in the light of criterions
   established by Monckeberg and Aschoff following a similar controversy in
   1910. The atrioventricular junctions are the areas where the atrial
   myocardium inserts into, and is separated from, the base of the
   ventricular mass, apart from at the site of penetration of the
   specialised axis for atrioventricular conduction. There are two such
   junctions in the normal heart, surrounding the orifices of the mitral
   and tricuspid valves. The true sept;al area between the junctions is of
   very limited extent, being formed by the membranous septum. Posterior
   and inferior to this septal area, the atrial myocardium overlies the
   crest of the ventricular septum, with the atrial component being
   demarcated by the landmarks of the triangle of Koch. The adjacent
   structures, and in particular the so-called inferior pyramidal space,
   were accurately described by McAlpine (Heart and Coronary Arteries,
   1975). Thus, again there is no need for revision of our understanding.
   The key to unravelling much of the alleged controversy is the
   recognition that, as indicated by Tawara, the atrioventricular node
   becomes the atrioventricular bundle at the point where the overall axis
   for conduction penetrates into the central fibrous body. There are also
   marked differences in arrangement, also described by Tawara, between the
   disposition of the conduction axis in man as compared to the dog. Anat

Abstract = {{PURPOSE
   this qualitative study explored the issues, concerns, and needs of
   low-income, southern African Americans in managing type 2 diabetes over
   time.
   METHODS
   Two focus groups (N=22) were conducted with the target population to
   collect data. Group sessions were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim.
   Content analysis was used to analyze the data.
   RESULTS
   The data revealed an overall theme of learning to live with diabetes,
   which consisted of 3 processes (1) symptom management, (2) making
   healthy choices, and (3) emotional adjustment. This article focuses on
   the processes of symptom management and making healthy choices. Findings
   suggest that the sequential processes of symptom management and making
   healthy choices occurred over time primarily through experiential
   learning in this population and were influenced by social support,
   caring and collaborative provider-client relationships, and access to
   resources and culturally sensitive supportive services.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Experiential educational methods that incorporate social support and
   access to resources may be more appropriate than the traditional
   didactic method of teaching diabetes self-care.}},

Abstract = {{The membrane complex alpha(IIb)beta(3) is the major receptor for
   fibrinogen and is involved in platelet adhesion and aggregation.
   Evidence has been presented that the Pl(A2) allele of the beta(3)
   Pl(A1/A2) gene polymorphism might be an independent risk factor for
   coronary thrombosis, but the matter is still controversial. We
   investigated the relationship between this polymorphism and possible
   alterations of platelet functions in vitro. The platelet adhesion to
   fibrinogen-coated microplate wells and the aggregation induced by
   several different agonists were tested in 63 healthy volunteers, among
   them, 49 subjects with Pl(A1/A1) polymorphism, 12 subjects with
   Pl(A1/A2) polymorphism and two subjects with Pl(A2/A2) polymorphism.
   Subjects with Pl(A1/A2) polymorphism or with Pl(A2/A2) polymorphism
   showed significantly lower platelet responses as compared with Pl(A1/A1)
   subjects when either arachidonic acid or the thromboxane A(2) analogue,
   U46619, were used as agonists. In resting condition and after thrombin
   or ADP stimulation, platelet function was normal in all the subjects. An
   increased sensitivity to the anti-aggregatory effect of acetylsalicylic
   acid was observed in platelets from subjects with the Pl(A2) allele.
   Finally, using a flow-cytometric evaluation and determining the
   beta-thromboglobulin plasma levels, we did not find any evidence of a
   Pl(A2) platelet hyper-reactivity ex vivo. Our findings are not
   consistent with the hypothesis that the purported increase of
   cardiovascular risk in these subjects may be as a result of platelet
   hyperactivation. On the contrary, the Pl(A2) allele is associated with a
   platelet functional deficiency, specifically linked to the activation of
   the fibrinogen receptor by thromboxane A(2).}},

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{78}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2344-2352}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The effects of the physical form of feed on water disappearance and the
   effects of buffered water on proximal stomach pH in swine were
   determined in two experiments. In Exp. 1, 32 barrows were used to
   evaluate the water disappearance in pigs fed a finely ground and
   pelleted diet vs those fed a coarsely ground and mashed diet for ad
   libitum consumption over a 2-wk interval. There were four replicates
   with eight pigs per replicate. Average daily water and feed
   disappearance did not differ (P = 0.06 and P = 0.10, respectively).
   However, average daily water to feed ratio was higher for pigs on the
   pelleted diet (4.21 +/- 0,31 L/kg vs 3.04 +/- 0.33 L/kg; P = 0.02). The
   higher ratio for the pelleted diet indicated that this may be the cause
   of a more fluid digesta allowing reflux of irritants from the distal
   stomach to damage the pars esophageal region of the proximal stomach. In
   Exp. 2, four barrows (25 +/- 2 kg) had gastric cannulas surgically
   implanted into the proximal region of the stomach. Pigs were given ad
   libitum access to a finely ground and pelleted diet. The experimental
   design was a Latin square. Water treatments included water (control),
   200 mOsm NaHCO3, 250 mOsm NaHCO3, and 250 mOsm mono-dibasic sodium
   phosphate. Pigs were given a 4-d adjustment period, and pH measurements
   began on the morning of the 5th d and continued for 24 h under normal
   feeding conditions. Feed was removed and measurements were continued for
   16 h. Buffered water raised the pH of the proximal region of the stomach
   compared to the control (P < 0.001). Average pR while consuming the
   water treatments was 3.65 +/- 0.11 (n = 4) for water control, 4.86 +/-
   0.11 (n = 4) for the 200 mOsm NaHCO3, 4.63 +/- 0.11 (n = 4) for the 250
   mOsm NaHCO3, and 4.59 +/- 0.14 (n = 3) for the 250 mOsm mono-dibasic
   sodium phosphate. Buffers also raised the pH of the proximal region of
   the stomach for the fed (P < 0.001) and the feed restriction (P < 0.01)
   phases of the trial. Water disappearance rates in pigs given NaHCO3 were
   higher than in the control (P < 0.01). Average daily water disappearance
   for the treatments was 9.13 +/- 0.74 L for the control, 13.56 +/- 0.74 L
   for 200 mOsm NaHCO3, 13.77 +/- 0.74 L for the 250 mOsm NaHCO3, and 10.33
   +/- 0.95 L for the phosphate buffer. The proximal pH of the stomach was
   increased by adding buffers to the water supply. Addition of NaHCO3
   buffers also caused increased water disappearance.}},

Abstract = {{The bispectral index (BIS) of the electroencephalogram has recently been
   used to monitor the depth of anaesthesia in humans. The BIS is a
   dimensionless number that varies between 0 and 100. We hypothesized that
   the BIS could also be used to monitor depth of isoflurane anaesthesia in
   goats. Needle electrodes were placed over the frontal region of the
   scalp of goats and 5\% isoflurane was administered via a mask. The BIS
   number was determined at clinically relevant end-points. The BIS number
   did not change when the animals became recumbent (95 +/- 5 to 94 +/- 7,
   n = 15), but decreased to 65 +/- 13 and 64 +/- 15 when the corneal
   reflex and withdrawal response to a noxious stimulus, respectively, were
   lost (p < 0.001, n = 12). Direct laryngoscopy and intubation increased
   the BIS (56 +/- 7 to 83 +/- 11; p < 0.05, n = 10), as did a noxious
   pinch to the dew-claw (57 +/- 9 to 76 +/- 9; p < 0.05, n = 10). The
   spectral edge (frequency below which 95\% of the total power resided)
   paralleled the change in BIS. We conclude that the depth of isoflurane
   anaesthesia in goats can be monitored using the BIS, although further
   work is needed to determine its sensitivity and specificity.}},

   characteristics of the HDV genome that was isolated. Among the 4728

   positive. Antibody to HDV (anti-HDV) was present in 32 (8.5\%) of these
   375 subjects, and liver function tests were normal in most subjects. The
   presence of HDV RNA was analysed by nested polymerase chain reaction
   (PCR). Thirteen out of the 32 anti-HDV antibody-positive subjects were
   HDV RNA positive. Thus, 3.5\% of HBsAg-positive subjects on Miyako
   Island were HDV RNA positive. Among the HDV RNA-positive subjects, liver
   function tests were within normal limits or were mildly abnormal.
   Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the HDV genomes on Miyako
   Island were similar to the Japanese and Taiwan isolates of HDV genotype
   II. Taiwan is geographically close to Miyako Island. Even though the

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative receptor autoradiography was used to examine the sequential
   patterns of changes in dopaminergic and glutamatergic receptors in the
   brain of rats lesioned with 6-hydroxydopamine. The animals were
   unilaterally lesioned in the medial forebrain bundle and the brains were
   analyzed at 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks of postlesion. Degeneration of the
   nigrostriatal pathway caused a significant increase in dopamine D-2
   receptors in the ipsilateral striatum from 1 to 8 weeks of postlesion.
   In the ipsilateral substantia nigra (SN), a significant decrease in
   dopamine D-2 receptors was also observed from 1 to 8 weeks of
   postlesion. On the other hand, dopamine D-1, receptors were increased in
   the ipsilateral ventromedial striatum from 3 to 4 weeks of postlesion.
   In the ipsilateral SN, a transient increase in dopamine D-1 receptors
   was observed only 1 week after lesioning. However, other regions in both
   ipsilateral and contralateral sides showed no significant change in
   dopamine D-1, and D-2, receptors during postlesion except for a
   transient change in a few regions. N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors
   showed no significant changes in all brain regions studied during the
   postlesion. In contrast, a transient increase in excitatory amino acid
   transport sites was observed only in the frontal cortex and ventromedial
   striatum of the ipsilateral side at 2 weeks of postlesion. However,
   glycine receptors showed a significant change in any brain areas of both
   ipsilateral and contralateral sides after lesioning. The change in the
   brain areas of contralateral side was more pronounced than that of
   ipsilateral side for glycine receptors. In addition, dopamine uptake
   sites showed a severe damage in the ipsilateral striatum from 1 to 8
   weeks after lesioning. In the contralateral side, in contrast, no
   significant change in dopamine uptake sites was found in the striatum
   during the postlesion. These results indicate that unilateral injection
   of 6-hydroxydopamine in the medial forebrain bundle can cause a
   significant increase in dopamine D-1 and D-2 receptors in the striatum.
   The increase in dopamine D-2, receptors was more pronounced than that in
   dopamine D-1 receptors in the striatum after 6-hydroxydopamine
   treatment. In contrast, dopamine uptake sites showed a severe damage in
   the striatum during the postlesion, Furthermore, our results support the
   existence of dopamine D-2 receptors on the neurons of SN, but not
   dopamine D-1 receptors. For glutamatergic receptor system, the present
   study suggests that the changes in glycine receptors may be more
   susceptible to degeneration of nigrostriatal pathway than NMDA receptors
   and excitatory amino acid transport sites. Thus, our findings are of
   interest in relation of degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway that
   occurs in Parkinson's disease (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

   Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted on a convenience sample
   from a cohort of children older than 5 years of age at the pediatric HIV
   outpatient clinic of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. Those
   patients were interviewed and examined systematically for peripheral
   nerve symptoms and signs.
   Results. A total of 39 patients were clinically evaluated. Their ages
   ranged from 5 to 14 years, and 13 patients (34\%) had symptoms and signs
   of peripheral nerve involvement. Distal paresthesia and/or pain plus
   diminished ankle jerks and/or diminished vibration sense were the most
   common clinical findings. Symptoms were chronic and fluctuating, and
   pain was, in general, not severe. Nerve conduction studies primarily
   revealed axonal changes.

Abstract = {{The Lena River Delta, largest in the Arctic, occupies 32,000 km(2). It
   has a complicated structure caused by neoitectonic block-movements,
   which formed an island archipelago with elevation differences as large
   as 60 m of distinct geological units. The modern active delta occupies
   spaces between older islands of the archipelago, and is just beginning
   to protrude into the open sea. The hydrologic pattern in the delta also
   shows the influence of tectonism. Numerous earthquakes during last
   century with magnitudes as large as 6 suggest that tectonic movement is
   continuing. Radiocarbon dating shows that the modern delta has been
   built during the second half of the Holocene. The total advance of the
   delta during this time was 120-150 km. The Lena River is considered the
   main sediment source for the Laptev Sea. The latest investigations give
   the suspended sediment load in the lower Lena River at 21 Mt/y, but only
   < 30\% of this load is thought to reach the sea. The bed load transport
   is considerable but its value is unknown. The active sub-aerial delta is
   bordered by a shallow platform as wide as 18 km, which turns into a
   relatively steep slope at the 2 m isobath. This feature, corresponding
   in depth to the thickness of the seasonal ice cover, is observed only
   off Arctic rivers and is not understood. Some sections of the modern
   delta have morphological features characteristic for advancing shores,
   others show signs of retreat. However no measurements of delta shore
   dynamics are available. Thus the general direction of the process is
   disputable. The western part of the Lena Delta is formed by a large,
   20-m-high sand island fringed by a unique lace coast formed by narrow
   estuary-like bays deeply penetrating the land. This unique coast
   undergoes intensive erosion not only on promontories but also inside of
   estuaries due to storm surges reaching to >2 m height. The sand island
   is characterized by typical lake-thermokarst relief, but no volumes of
   underground ice large enough to explain this relief are known. The
   elongated lake depressions and lakes are oriented about 2-8 degrees
   True. In the middle of generally 1- to a-m-deep lakes are equally
   oriented hollows as deep as 25 m. The lakes are degrading because of
   erosion by stream channels draining them. The lake-thermokarst relief on
   the north slope of the island is partly or totally destroyed by erosion
   processes. Thus the Lena Delta is characterized by several unique
   features that are either poorly understood or unexplained.}},

Abstract = {{To test the hypothesis that variation in photosynthesis can cause
   differences in fitness, we compared wild-type (WT) Amaranthus hybridus
   genotypes to those having a single-gene mutation (R) that affects
   photosynthetic rate. By using light and water treatments, we generated a
   range of differences between WT and R genotypes in photosynthetic rate,
   growth and reproduction at three developmental stages. In two cases
   photosynthetic differences were in the expected direction (WT > R), they
   did not differ in others, and in one case the R genotype had a higher
   rate than the WT. Across light and water treatments, higher rates of
   photosynthesis were related to increases in specific leaf area, leaf
   nitrogen content and stomatal conductance relative to the other
   genotype. Differences between genotypes in growth and allocation
   paralleled those in photosynthesis; in treatments where photosynthetic
   rate differed between the genotypes (high light), growth and
   reproduction did as well. In high light, the effects of genotype on
   fitness were indirect with high-water availability, but were direct with
   low-water availability. When photosynthetic rate did not differ between
   genotypes (low light), neither did growth and reproduction. These
   results demonstrate that variation in photosynthesis can cause
   differences in growth and reproduction. Furthermore, resource
   availability can moderate the ways in which selection operates on
   photosynthetic traits.}},

Abstract = {{Current pediatric and psychiatric studies on encopresis and its
   treatment are heavily influenced by mechanical, physiological, and
   behavioral considerations. Although psychodynamic treatment has
   generally been considered to be of little benefit, and its findings
   suspect, the authors suggest that a psychodynamic approach adds
   substantially to the understanding of some cases of encopresis; that the
   anal sensations and anal erotic feelings reported by a number of
   encopretic children are intense, and that the encopretic symptom,
   soiling, in these children is the result of a conscious form of anal
   masturbation in which the fecal mass is used for stimulation; and that
   any study of encopresis is incomplete that does not include what
   encopretic children, engaged in a sound therapeutic relationship, know
   and say about their soiling. The authors further suggest that physical
   treatments of those children whose encopresis is psychologically driven
   may be contraindicated. The presence of a large stool does not in itself
   substantiate a physical illness. Further research is needed to elucidate
   the prevalence of anal masturbation in encopretic children.}},

Journal = {{GENES TO CELLS}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{711-723}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Nuclear receptors are essential players in the development
   of all metazoans. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans possesses more
   than 200 putative nuclear receptor genes, several times more than the
   number known in any other organism. Very few of these transcription
   factors are conserved with components of the steroid response pathways
   in vertebrates and arthropods. Ftz-F1, one of the evolutionarily oldest
   nuclear receptor types, is required for steroidogenesis and sexual
   differentiation in mice and for segmentation and metamorphosis in
   Drosophila.
   Results: We employed two complementary approaches, direct mutagenesis
   and RNA interference, to explore the role of nhr-25, a C. elegans
   ortholog of Ftz-F1. Deletion mutants show that nhr-25 is essential for
   embryogenesis. RNA interference reveals additional requirements
   throughout the postembryonic life, namely in moulting and
   differentiation of the gonad and vulva. All these defects are consistent
   with the nhr-25 expression pattern, determined by in situ hybridization
   and GFP reporter activity.
   Conclusions: Our data link the C. elegans Ftz-F1 ortholog with a number
   of developmental processes. Significantly, its role in the periodical
   replacement of cuticle (moulting) appears to be evolutionarily shared
   with insects and thus supports the monophyletic origin of moulting.}},

   Both kinds of samples, stressed and unstressed thin films, present a
   weak perpendicular anisotropy. For identical composition of the
   multilayers, an increase of the magnetization component perpendicular to
   the sample plane has been observed in stressed samples compared to their
   unstressed counterparts. In addition, the effect of the stress on the

Abstract = {{Objective:To investigate the effect of 4\% succinylated modified fluid
   gelatin (MFG) versus mean weight, highly substituted 6\% hydroxyethyl
   starch (HES) on hemodynamic and gastric mucosal acidosis variables, in
   septic hypovolemic patients.
   Design: Prospective, randomized, clinical investigation.
   Setting: University hospital intensive care unit.
   Patients: Thirty-four septic hypovolemic ventilated and hemodynamically
   controlled patients.
   Interventions: Invasive hemodynamic and gastric tonometric measurements.
   Measurements and results: Hemodynamic and tonometric parameters were
   recorded at baseline and 60 min after infusion of 500 ml of each
   colloid. In all patients central venous pressure, pulmonary artery
   occlusion pressure, cardiac index and mean arterial pressure increased
   significantly with both colloids, and hemoglobin concentration decreased
   by the same amount while oxygen delivery remained stable. Gastric
   intramucosal pH increased from 7.27 +/- 0.08 to 7.31 +/- 0.07 (p <
   0.001) with MFG and decreased non-significantly from 7.26 +/- 0.11 to
   7.22 +/- 0.08 (ns) with HES. Carbon dioxide gastric mucosal arterial
   gradient decreased from 18 +/- 9 to 13 +/- 9 mmHg (p < 0.0005) in the
   MFG group and rose non-significantly from 18 +/- 11 to 21 +/- 11 mmHg
   with HES.
   Conclusions: Although MFG and 6\% HES have the same hemodynamic effects,
   their physicochemical properties induce different responses on gastric
   mucosal acidosis in septic, hypovolemic and ventilated patients. These
   effects of MFG and HES on gastric mucosa need to be considered in

Abstract = {{The management of electronic document collections is fundamentally
   different from the management of paper documents. The ephemeral nature
   of some electronic documents means that the document address (i.e.,
   reference details of the document) can become incorrect some time after
   coming into use, resulting in references, such as index entries and
   hypertext links, failing to correctly address the document they
   describe. A classic case of invalidated references is on the World Wide
   Web-links that point to a named resource fail when the domain name, file
   name, or any other aspect of the addressed resource is changed,
   resulting in the well-known Error 404. Additionally, there are other
   errors which arise from changes to document collections.
   This paper surveys the strategies used both in World Wide Web software
   and other hypertext systems for managing the integrity of references and
   hence the integrity of links. Some strategies are preventative, not
   permitting errors to occur; others are corrective, discovering reference
   errors and sometimes attempting to correct them; while the last strategy
   is adaptive, because references are calculated on a just-in-time basis,
   according the current state of the document collection.}},

   system to phase equations on a torus. We consider example applications

Abstract = {{We have developed a method for measuring the temperature and relative
   humidity of air prior to and after nasal conditioning and used it to
   study the effect of treatment with ipratropium bromide on the ability of
   the nose to condition cold, dry air. We performed randomized,
   double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-way crossover studies and an open
   study in nonallergic subjects. The subjects were treated with
   ipratropium bromide (84 mu g) or normal saline solution sprayed into the
   nasal cavity 15 min before the measurement of nasal conditioning
   capacity. Cold, dry air was delivered to the nose via a nasal mask, and
   the temperature and humidity of air were measured before entering and
   after exiting the nasal cavity. The total water gradient across the nose
   was calculated and represents nasal conditioning capacity. Ipratropium
   bromide treatment significantly increased nasal conditioning capacity
   when compared with saline. Ipratropium bromide led to less reduction in
   the cold, dry air-induced decrease in the nasal volume (p <0.05) without
   affecting the decrease in nasal surface temperature during cold, dry air
   exposure (p = 0.3). Our data show that ipratropium bromide increases the
   ability of the nose to condition cold, dry air. Thus, treating rhinitis
   with ipratropium bromide should not increase the burden for inspired air
   conditioning on the conducting pulmonary airways.}},

Abstract = {{A simulator based on the coupling of mode (COM) theory, previously
   developed for modelling the bulk substrate surface acoustic wave (SAW)
   devices, was modified to be adapted for layered structures. The
   frequency response of ZnO/diamond/Si-SAW filter was calculated and the
   results were compared with experimental ones extracted from the
   literature. A good agreement is obtained for the frequencies within and
   close to the pass-band of the filter. Outside of this pass-band, the
   experimental frequency response exhibits an asymmetry, which is not
   reproduced by the simulation. This asymmetry is attributed to the
   dispersion, as a function of frequency, of SAW velocity (V-P) and
   electromechanical coupling coefficient (K-2), which cannot be neglected
   in the case of layered structures. In the original program developed for
   bulk structures, K-2 and V were assumed to be constant. To take into
   account the effect of dispersion, the program was modified by the
   introduction of a dispersive model. The confrontation between the
   results obtained by simulation, including the dispersive model, and by
   experimental measurements shows a good agreement. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background. The purpose of this study was to detect the fraction of peak
   oxygen consumption ((V) over dot O-2peak) that elicits maximal rates of
   fat oxidation during submaximal treadmill exercise. It was hypothesized
   that this point would appear at a work rate just below the ventilatory
   threshold.
   Methods. Experimental design: subjects completed a protocol requiring
   them to exercise for 15 min on a treadmill at six different workloads,
   25, 40, 55, 65, 75, and 85\% (V) over dot O-2speak, over two separate
   visits. Participants: nine healthy, moderately-trained eumenorrheic
   females (age = 28.8+/-5.99 yrs, (V) over dot O-2peak = 47.20 +/-2.57
   ml.kg(-1).min(-1)) volunteered for the study. Measures: a one-way ANOVA
   with repeated measures was used to test for differences across exercise
   intensities in the metabolic variables (i.e. substrate oxidation, blood
   lactate concentration ({[}La-]), RER, and the contribution of fat to
   total energy expenditure). Following significant F ratios, post-hoc
   tests were used to detect differences between the means for various
   exercise intensities.
   Results. Exercise at 75\% (V) over dot O-2peak elicited the greatest
   rate of fat oxidation (4.75+/-0.49 kcal.min(-1)), and this intensity was
   coincident with the ventilatory threshold (76+/-7.41\% (V) over dot
   O-2peak). Moreover, a significant difference (t(8) = -3.98, p<0.01) was
   noted between the mean ventilatory threshold and lactate threshold.
   Conclusions. The finding that a relatively heavy work rate elicits the
   highest rate of fat oxidation in an active, female population has
   application in exercise prescription and refutes the belief that
   low-intensity exercise is preferred for fat metabolism.}},

   elicits a hypersensitive response (HR) in leaves of Lycopersicon
   esculentum near-isogenic line (NIL) 216 and pepper genotypes, One cosmid
   clone (35 kb) selected from a genomic library of a T3 strain induced an
   HR in all resistant plants. A 1.5-kb active subclone containing the
   putative avirulence (avr) gene, designated avrXv3, was sequenced. The
   avrXv3 gene encodes a 654-bp open reading frame (ORF) with no homology
   to any known gene. Expression studies with a fusion of this gene and
   uidA indicated that avrXv3 is plant inducible and controlled by the
   hypersensitivity and pathogenicity (hrp) regulatory system. Mutational
   analysis and transcription activation assays revealed that AvrXv3 has
   transcription activation activity in yeast, and that the putative domain
   responsible for that activity is located at the C terminus of the AvrXv3
   protein. Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transient expression
   confirmed the direct role of AvrXv3 in eliciting the HR in tomato NIL
   216 and supported the hypothesis that Avr proteins must be present
   inside the plant host cell to trigger the HR.}},

   K (nBE), 146 K (iBE) and 150 K (tBE). We were successful in
   crystallizing nBE and tBE, and determined thermodynamic functions for
   Fusion for the first time. The temperatures of fusion and their enthalpy
   changes are 199.53 K, 11.8 kJ mol(-1) for nBE and 223.09 K, 11.4 kJ
   mol(-1) for tBE. Where possible, we calculated thermodynamic functions.
   The total entropy in the liquid state at fusion is almost the same,
   within 1\%, between nBE and tBE. However, the values of the liquid heat
   capacity are about 10\% different at the melting point. This indicates
   that the entropy fluctuation is different while the global average of
   the entropy remains the same. We measured the density of the liquid and

Abstract = {{Vermicomposts, which are produced by the fragmentation of organic wastes
   by earthworms, have a fine particulate structure and contain nutrients
   in forms that are readily available for plant uptake. In greenhouse
   trials, the growth of marigold and tomato seedlings, in a commercial
   horticultural potting medium (Metro-Mix 360), was enhanced significantly
   upon substitution of Metro-Mix 360 with 10 \% or 20 \% vermicomposted
   pig solids or vermicomposted food wastes, when all required nutrients
   were supplied. Same enhancement in marigold and tomato seedlings' growth
   occurred also upon substitution of Metro-Mix 360 with composted
   biosolids, but not with leaf compost. The shoot dry weights of raspberry
   plants, grown in a mineral soil mixed with vermicomposted pig wastes
   weighed more than those grown in unfertilized control soil, and were as
   great as those in soil receiving a complete fertilizer treatment. By
   comparison, raspberry shoot growth in soils amended with yard, leaf or
   bark composts, was poorer than that in the unfertilized control soil.
   Amending the soil with 4 \% chicken manure compost killed most of the
   raspberry plants. However, plant mortality was reduced and growth
   restored when the chicken manure compost was mixed with vermicomposted
   pig solids, but not with bark or yard composts. Plant growth in soils
   containing a mixture of chicken manure compost with 20\% vermicomposted
   pig wastes was similar to that of plants grown in the unfertilized
   control. Our results showed that vermicomposts have the potential for
   improving plant growth when added to greenhouse container media or soil.
   However, there seem to be distinct differences between specific
   vermicomposts and composts in terms of their nutrient contents, the
   nature of their microbial communities, and their effects on plant
   growth.}},

Abstract = {{Spindle cell lipoma demonstrates a distinctive histologic appearance and
   characteristic clinical presentation. We recently observed two cases of
   solitary subcutaneous neoplasm of the foot with histologic features of
   spindle cell lipoma that in one case includes a minor component of the
   overlapping tumor, pleomorphic lipoma. Because the foot is an unusual
   location for these neoplasms, immunoperoxidase and cytogenetic studies
   were performed. In both cases, staining was strongly positive for CD34
   and negative for smooth muscle actin. Cytogenetic studies from the tumor
   with a pleomorphic component revealed features consistent with a
   lipomatous neoplasm, but are otherwise diagnostically nonspecific. An
   analysis of the literature reveals that although CD34 immunoreactivity
   is characteristic of spindle cell lipoma and helps exclude nonlipomatous
   neoplasms, it does not clearly eliminate other well-differentiated
   lipomatous tumors. Accordingly, without the aid of classic tumor
   location, the diagnosis of the spindle cell/pleomorphic lipoma group
   relies primarily on histologic features, with supportive but not
   definitive information provided by immunoperoxidase and cytogenetic
   studies. Obscuring this issue, however, are the imprecise histologic
   distinction between these tumors and those of the atypical
   lipoma/atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma group
   and the nomenclature controversy that surrounds the latter group of
   neoplasms. Despite these obstacles, both groups of well-differentiated
   lipomatous tumors are clinically benign when subcutaneously located.}},

Title = {{Are household firearms stored safely? It depends on whom you ask}},
Journal = {{PEDIATRICS}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To determine gun storage practices in gun-owning households
   with children.
   Design. National random digit-dial telephone survey of 2521 households
   conducted in March 1999 through July 1999. This study uses a subsample
   of 434 households with children <18 years old in which a respondent
   reported either: 1) personally owning a gun, or 2) living in a
   gun-owning household but not owning a gun themselves. Respondents were
   asked whether any household gun was currently stored loaded, and, if
   yes, whether any gun was currently stored loaded and unlocked.
   Results. Twenty-one percent of gun owners compared with 7\% of nonowners
   reported that a household gun was stored loaded, while 9\% and 2\%,
   respectively, reported that a household gun was stored loaded and
   unlocked. Nongun owners were significantly more likely than were gun
   owners to be female (87\% vs 22\%) and to report that they lived in a
   house with only 1 gun (70\% vs 57\%) and no handguns (51\% vs 31\%).
   Based on the reports of actual gun owners (n = 252), households with
   children <13 years old were significantly less likely to store a gun
   loaded and unlocked (multivariate odds ratio: .1;95\% confidence
   interval:.0,.4) than were households with teenagers only.
   Conclusions. We find that among gun-owning households with children,
   nongun owners report significantly lower rates of guns stored loaded and
   unlocked than do gun owners. These findings are consistent with recent
   studies that have found that married men are far more likely to report
   household gun ownership than are married women, and that gun users are
   far more likely to report that a gun is stored loaded or loaded and
   unlocked than are never users. Our findings suggest that nongun owners,
   the vast majority of whom are women (87\%), may be unaware that guns in
   their homes are stored in a manner that experts agree is unsafe.
   Our findings reinforce the importance of many pediatricians' current
   efforts to offer anticipatory guidance about firearms to gun-owning
   families, and, in addition, suggest that this guidance can be adapted
   depending on whether the physician is speaking with a gun-owning or
   nongun-owning parent. In particular, because gun owners (mostly fathers)
   are less likely to bring children to the pediatrician's office than are
   nonowners (mostly mothers), physicians should take advantage of any
   opportunities that they have to address gun-related issues with parents
   who personally own guns. More commonly, physicians can encourage nongun
   owners to participate more fully in household decision-making about gun
   storage by letting them know not only about recommended storage
   practices, but also that many nonowners may not know how guns are
   actually stored in their own homes.}},

Abstract = {{. BACKGROUND Interactions between the pharmaceutical industry and
   physicians have been discussed in numerous publications; however, most
   articles are limited to surveys and self-report data and often focus on
   academic or training contexts. We describe the role of pharmaceutical
   representatives and the use of samples in community-based family
   practices, using data obtained by directly observing clinical
   encounter's.
   . METHODS We collected detailed descriptive field notes of the direct
   observations of 53 primary care clinicians and 1588 patient encounters
   in 18 purposefully selected Nebraska family practices. We used a
   comparative case study design, that used depth interviews of clinicians
   and office staff, and included details of the interactions with
   pharmaceutical representatives and the use of samples in clinical
   encounters.
   . RESULTS Individual providers and practices displayed noticeable
   variation in their approaches to drug representatives and samples. We
   found formal strategies and policies in 3 minority of practices.
   Generally there was little structure in the organization and
   distribution of sample medications at the office level, and detailed
   patient education regarding these: drugs was rarely observed in patient
   encounters, Nevertheless, samples were used in almost 20\% of observed
   encounters, at times as starter dosages, but often as complete courses
   of treatment, The benefits derived from contact with the pharmaceutical
   industry varied substantially, but most often included free medication
   samples, meals, and patient education materials.
   . CONCLUSIONS Clinicians have a complex symbiosis with the
   pharmaceutical industry and need to critically evaluate their handling
   of samples and their contact with pharmaceutical representatives to
   optimize this relationship and ensure quality patient care. Clinics with
   specific policies for interactions with drug companies appear to derive
   more satisfaction from their encounters.}},

Abstract = {{Porous pavements are widely used for local disposal of storm water. This
   paper presents the results of a full-scale study of ground temperatures
   in porous pavement during periods with prolonged freezing conditions and
   during snowmelt. The pavement construction was situated in a housing
   area in Lulea in northern Sweden, and it consisted of porous asphalt
   over an aggregate base of macadam. It was found that the cooling of the
   porous pavement was governed by variations in ambient air temperature
   and that freezing of the soil below the subgrade was related to the
   freezing index. The porous pavement was more resistant to freezing than
   a conventional impermeable pavement due to higher water content in the
   underlying soil, which increased the latent heat in the ground. Thawing
   of the porous pavement was a rapid process, which depended on meltwater
   infiltration. The thawing process in a comparable impermeable pavement
   was slower.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Nitrogen (N-2) microbubbles activate the blood platelets and
   coagulation system. Hypothesis: Breathing nitrox rather than air may
   reduce the level of platelet activation associated with decompression.
   Methods: We tested platelet counts and the expression of functional
   membrane molecules on platelets in 10 divers subjected to saturated
   compression in nitrox at 4 ATA and in 9 divers subjected to compression
   in air at 2.8 ATA. Blood samples were taken before and immediately after
   the test. We measured the percentages of microplatelets, platelet
   aggregates and platelets bearing the activation marker CD62P, and
   bearing molecules forming receptors for fibrinogen (CD61) and for von
   Willebrand factor (CD42b) using flow cytometry and specific monoclonal
   antibodies. Symptoms for DCS were also evaluated. Results: DCS symptoms
   were not noted in either the nitrox or air group. In both groups we
   observed a marked increase in the percentage of activated platelets
   bearing CD62P molecules and an enhanced number of microplatelets and a
   marked drop in the platelets count in the blood of divers in the air
   group. Conclusion: In all divers we observed certain changes in the
   platelet system, nevertheless decompression in nitrox resulted in a
   lesser degree of platelet activation. Though this study cannot exclude
   platelet activation as an etiological factor in DCS, the findings
   suggest platelet activation can occur in the absence of observable sign
   of DCS. Thus, platelet activation may be too sensitive a marker to serve
   as a predictor of DCS.}},

Abstract = {{The N-end rule is one ubiquitin-proteolytic pathway that relates the in

   recognized, ubiquitylated by UBR1/E3 alpha, and subsequently degraded by
   26S proteasomes. Previous research showed that NTAN1-deficient mice
   exhibited impaired long-term memory in the Lashley III maze. Therefore,
   a series of studies, designed to assess the role of NTAN1 in short- and

Abstract = {{Background. Small intestinal canine submucosa has been used in previous
   studies as a large diameter arterial graft and has shown acceptable
   patency rates. The aim of our experimental study was to assess its
   effectiveness when it is used as an autogenous medium-sized diameter
   arterial graft (5-7 mm).
   Methods. Fifteen mongrel dogs were included and underwent laparotomy
   under general anaesthesia. The mucosa, tunica muscularis and serosa were
   removed from a resected intestinal segment. The remaining tube, which
   consisted of the submucosa and the basilar tunica mucosa, represented
   the experimental graft which was used to replace a proportional gap of
   the canine infrarenal aorta. Ascertainment of peripheral pulses,
   measurement of the intra-aortic pressures, aortography and in vivo/in
   situ observation before the sacrifice of the animals, were the
   procedures used for verification of the graft's patency.
   Results. The resistance to thrombogenicity of the graft was considered
   satisfactory: nine out of 10 grafts remained patent for postoperative
   intervals ranging from one day to one year; one graft showed partial
   obstruction due to a technical perioperative error. The grafts showed
   also excellent physical characteristics (ease of handling and suturing,
   blood impermeability and durability), resistance to infection and showed
   no tendency to develop myointimal hyperplasia.
   Conclusions. Small intestinal canine submucosa showed satisfactory
   haemodynamic properties, long-term patency and resistance to
   infection,when used as a medium-diameter arterial substitute.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, optometrists have started to work in some clinical
   roles in hospital medical clinics. This paper outlines the current
   working practice in a typical glaucoma clinic at Moorfields Eye Hospital
   NHS Trust and goes on to establish the ability of an optometrist working
   with a team of ophthalmologists.
   In this study, 54 patients (n = 108 eyes) were recruited and clinically
   assessed by an optometrist. Subsequently, a research fellow (i.e.
   ophthalmologist) assessed the same patients independently. The results
   were compared in order to determine the accuracy of the optometrist's
   evaluation and proposed management.
   This paper considers the costs of employing personnel by reviewing the
   salaries of optometrists and medical assistants. Although nurses have
   started to work alongside ophthalmologists, and orthoptists may be
   considering such work, it is not within the scope of this paper to
   consider either of these groups. If optometrists are to become an
   accepted part of a glaucoma clinical team, consideration needs to be
   given to the training and experience they receive. (C) 2000 The College

Abstract = {{The choice of a given propagation model has a major impact on the
   accuracy and effectiveness of cellular planning, especially in urban
   environment, where a higher degree of detail is required. Rigorous
   models, such as those based on ray optics, are generally heavily
   time-consuming; furthermore, they are accurate only if high-resolution
   databases (of buildings, land usage, etc.) are available, and the cost
   of these databases is increasingly affecting the operators' budget.
   Therefore, one should use them only in their ``validity domain,{''}
   i.e., the area where they are both reliable and necessary: using complex
   tools where it's not needed implies an overhead in terms of computation
   time and, above all, database cost. For this reason, increasing interest
   and effort are being devoted by operators, manufacturers, and system
   planners in general to determine the validity domains of propagation
   models in urban environment. In this paper, we introduce a new
   methodology, based on objective indicators related to field strength
   statistics, to determine these domains.}},

Abstract = {{Normal channel catfish leukocytes readily undergo spontaneous in vitro
   immortalization yielding functionally active diploid cell lines. Since
   telomerase activation appears to be a critical step in the establishment
   of immortal mammalian cells, studies were undertaken to determine if and
   when telomerase expression occurs during the in vitro immortalization
   process of channel catfish leukocytes. To this end, freshly isolated
   peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) from normal fish were shown to exhibit
   low to undetectable levels of telomerase activity and within four days
   after culture initiation showed dramatic increases in telomerase
   activity which typically remained high for at least four weeks. This
   activity then declined, concomitant with decreases in cellular
   proliferation and increases in cell death. Cells which escaped this
   culture ``crisis{''} re-expressed high levels of telomerase activity
   indefinitely. Although telomerase activity was expressed early in the
   immortalization process, clonal cell lines derived from these cultures
   had relatively short telomeres. These results suggest that telomerase
   expression in catfish leukocytes is activation-induced, and its
   expression does not necessarily stabilize telomere length until a
   critically, albeit ill-defined, short length is reached. (C) 2000

Journal = {{LAIT}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{80}},

Abstract = {{Strains of bifidobacteria of human origin (Bifidobacterium bifidum, B.
   breve, B. infantis and B. longum) were inoculated simultaneously with
   mixed cultures of lactococci, citrate-fermenting lactococci and
   leuconostocs to determine their impact on biochemical characteristics of
   fermented dairy products. Fermentations were carried out under different
   conditions of temperature, milk protein concentration and ratio of
   acidifying/aromatic lactic acid bacteria. The survival or growth of
   bifidobacteria during production of fermented milk was not affected by
   the presence of lactic starters. On the other hand, the presence of
   bifidobacteria during the production of fermented milk did not influence
   the growth of total lactococci, citrate-fermenting lactococci and
   leuconostoes. The variation of the milk protein content did not modify
   the growth of bifidobacteria and mixed-cultures of lactic starters.
   However, the presence of bifidobacteria changed the final characteristic
   of the fermented milk. Residual lactose in fermented milks containing B.
   breve, B. bifidum and B. infantis was lower than that found in fermented
   milks without bifidobacteria and those containing B. longum. The
   fermented milks without bifidobacteria contained less acetaldehyde than
   those containing bifidobacteria whereas the concentration of diacetyl
   was less important in the presence of bifidobacteria. However, the
   ethanol concentration increased when bifidobacteria were used with mixed
   cultures of lactococci, citrate-fermenting lactococci and leuconostocs.
   A temperature of 35 degreesC seems to be desirable because it allows the
   growth of bifidobacteria without affecting in a drastic way the growth
   and activity of leuconostocs and other lactic starters.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the impaired lexical access and semantic

   Action Naming Test (ANT) were analyzed across three test sessions for 39

   before and after cues were classified as either impaired access if
   failures occurred at an earlier test session followed by successful
   naming at a later test session or semantic degradation if naming was
   successful at an earlier test session followed by failures at a later
   test session. The results indicated that on both the BNT and ANT all age
   groups produced more naming failures attributed to impaired access than
   to semantic degradation. However, for object naming, the failures showed
   significantly more semantic degradation for people in their 70s compared
   to the younger age groups. By contrast, fur action naming, semantic
   degradation was negligible, possibly masked by a ceiling effect, and the
   only age-difference result that approached significance indicated that

   conclusion is that migrant income earned in the tomato fields and
   packing plants, is fundamental for the bare survival in villages in
   poverty-stricken regions. However, this does not provide a solution to
   poverty alleviation because migrant income is not sufficient to
   contribute to capital formation in the migrating communities, or the to

Title = {{A comparison of risk-based capital standards under the expected

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RISK AND INSURANCE}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{67}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{397-413}},

Abstract = {{Two competing approaches to setting risk-based capital (RBC) parameters
   are the traditional probability of ruin approach and the more recent
   expected policyholder deficit (EPD) ratio approach. The probability of
   ruin approach develops capital standards based on a fixed maximum
   probability of insolvency regardless of risk. The EPD ratio approach
   allows tradeoffs between the risk of insolvency and the average cost of
   insolvency so as to force the product of these two numbers, the EPD, to
   some fixed value. After an explanation of the underlying mathematics,
   the author develops risk-based capital parameters for private passenger
   auto liability reserve risk using both methods. The author shows that
   capital standards developed using the EPD approach increase the risk of
   insolvency for larger insurers that pose the greatest potential indirect
   costs to the insurance market through market disruptions in the wake of
   a major insolvency. These findings have important public policy
   implications because the EPD approach currently forms the basis for both
   the Standard \& Poor's capital adequacy model and the A.M. Best
   Company's Best's Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR), and it is also used by
   the American Academy of Actuaries' Risk-Based Capital Task Force as a
   basis for recommendations to the National Association of Insurance
   Commissioners (NAIC) on parameters in the regulatory RBC model.}},

Abstract = {{In the area surrounding the Altbach/Deizisau power station, an
   environmental monitoring programme was installed in 1983 for a period of
   5 years, using biological indicators and augmented by immission
   measurements and soil analyses. The approximate cause was the granting
   of approval in 1981 under immission-control law for the building on the
   Altbach/Deizisau site of a new heat and power station. The programme
   continued on voluntary basis until 1998, always adjusted to current
   questions in air pollution control strategy. For the biomonitoring of
   air pollutants in the surroundings of a powerplant, lichen mapping and
   standardised lichen exposure as the best suitable methods are available.
   The evaluations of these observations are compared with the results of
   the immission measurements of SO2 and NO2. Since lichen mapping is
   particularly important for a long time observation of air pollution the
   evaluation of the lichen mappings was compared with the results of
   regional studies in Baden-Wurttemberg and in several Hessian observation
   areas. The programme has definitely proved that emissions of the power
   plant have caused no increase of the air pollution level in the
   Esslingen/Altbach area. There are no measurable effects due to
   immissions attributable to the power plant station. It could also be
   proved that the plant operates in an environmentally acceptable manner.
   Overall an improvement of air quality was observed since 1983 in
   accordance with the country-wide trend.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes E-DEVICE, an extensible active knowledge base
   system (KBS) that supports the processing of event-driven, production,
   and deductive rules into the same active OODB system. E-DEVICE provides
   the infrastructure for the smooth integration of various declarative
   rule types, such as production and deductive rules, into an active OODB
   system that supports low-level event-driven rules only by: I) mapping
   each declarative rule into one event-driven rule, offering centralized
   rule selection control for correct run-time behavior and conflict
   resolution, and 2) using complex events to map the conditions of
   declarative rules and monitor the database to incrementally match those
   conditions. E-DEVICE provides the infrastructure for easily extending
   the system by adding: 1) new rule types as subtypes of existing ones,
   and 2) transparent optimizations to the rule matching network. The
   resulting system is a flexible, yet efficient, KBS that gives the user
   the ability to express knowledge in a variety of high-level forms for
   advanced problem solving in data intensive applications.}},

Abstract = {{To examine the effects of intrauterine growth restriction and acute
   severe oxygen deprivation on renal blood flow (RBF), renovascular
   resistance (RVR), and renal excretory functions in newborns, studies
   were conducted on 1-day-old anesthetized piglets divided into groups of
   normal weight (NW, n = 14) and intrauterine growth-restricted (IUGR, n =
   14) animals. Physiological parameters, RBF, RVR, and urinary flow, were
   similar in NW and IUGR piglets, but glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and
   filtration fraction were significantly less in IUGR animals (P< 0.05).
   An induced 1-h severe hypoxia (arterial PO2 = 19 +/- 4 mmHg) resulted
   in, for both groups, a pronounced metabolic acidosis, strongly reduced
   RBF, and increased fractional sodium excretion (FSE; P< 0.05) with a
   less-pronounced increase of RVR and arterial catecolamines in IUGR
   piglets. Of significance was a smaller decrease in RBF for IUGR piglets
   (P< 0.05). Early recovery showed a transient period of diuresis with
   increased osmotic clearance and elevated FSE in both groups (P< 0.05).
   However, GFR and renal O-2 delivery remained reduced in NW piglets (P<
   0.05). We conclude that, in newborn IUGR piglets, RBF is maintained,
   although GFR is compromised. Severe hypoxemia induces similar
   alterations of renal excretion in newborn piglets. However, the
   less-pronounced RBF reduction during hypoxemia indicates an improved
   adaptation of newborn IUGR piglets on periods of severely disturbed
   oxygenation. Furthermore, newborn piglets reestablish the ability for
   urine concentration and adequate sodium reabsorption early after
   reoxygenation so that a sustained acute renal failure was prevented.}},

Abstract = {{The formulation of the microplane model for concrete and development of
   model M4 in the three preceding companion papers in this study is here
   extended to large strains. After giving examples of certain difficulties
   with the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor in the modeling of
   strength and frictional limits on weak planes within the material, the
   back-rotated Cauchy (true) tensor is introduced as the stress measure.
   The strain tensor conjugate to the back-rotated Cauchy (or Kirchhoff)
   stress tensor is unsuitable because it is non-holonomic (i.e.,
   path-dependent) and because its microplane components do not
   characterize meaningful deformation measures. Therefore Green's
   Lagrangian tensor is adopted, even though it is not conjugate. Only for
   this strain measure do the microplane components of the strain tensor
   suffice to characterize the normal stretch and shear angle on that
   microplane. Using such nonconjugate strain and stress tensors is
   admissible because, for concrete, the elastic parts of strains as well
   as the total volumetric strains are always small, and because the
   algorithm used guarantees the energy dissipation by large inelastic
   strains to be nonnegative. Examples of dynamic structural analysis are
   given.}},

   assemblies (constructs) of previously optimized building blocks.
   Optimized at each level of assembly are the external shape of the
   construct and the relative thickness of each duct for fluid flow. It is
   shown that in the end the fluid channels form a tree network that cools
   every point of the given volume. Length scales smaller than the
   thickness of the elemental volume are reached by conduction through the
   solid beat-generating material. Two fluid channel geometries are

Abstract = {{Aim. To investigate the effects of combined hormone replacement therapy
   (HRT) on the vascular impedance of the uterine, inferior vesicle, and

   Methods. Thirty-five postmenopausal patients were divided in two groups:
   21 patients with 1-5 years of menopause and 14 patients with greater
   than or equal to 6 years of menopause. Each group was examined in basal
   condition and after 1, 3, and 6 months of HRT. The blood flow impedances
   of the uterine, inferior vesicle, and ophthalmic arteries were analyzed
   by color Doppler, Estradiol plasma concentrations were assayed on the
   day of Doppler examination.
   Results. The analysis of uterine and inferior vesicle artery flow
   velocities showed a significant positive correlation between the
   resistance index (RT) and years of menopause. Higher impedance values
   were found in patients with longer interval from last menstrual bleeding
   (p <0.05). In patients with greater than or equal to 6 years of
   menopause, the impedances of uterine and inferior vesicle arteries were
   0.94+/-0.03 and 0.91+/-0.04, respectively, whereas in patients with 1-5
   years of menopause the impedances were 0.89+/-0.04 and 0.98+/-0.02,
   respectively. We noticed no significant correlation between baseline RT
   and duration of menopause at the level of ophthalmic artery in either
   group (0.72 vs. 0.73, respectively; p<0.05). After six months-of HRT,
   plasma estradiol concentrations inversely correlated with RI of uterine
   (r=0.2556; p =0.021), inferior vesicle (r=0.2653; p=0.023) and
   ophthalmic (r=-0.2211; p=0.017) arteries.
   Conclusion. Doppler studies of uterine, inferior vesicle, and ophthalmic
   arteries can provide specific and precise pathophysiological information
   to assess blood flow variations in correlation with combined HRT.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Kawasaki syndrome (KS) causes an acute vasculitis of unknown
   etiology. It is a leading cause of acquired heart disease of children in
   Japan and the United States.
   Methods, We examined the incidence of KS in a well-defined population
   group of children less than or equal to 6 years of age, using data
   collected through the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) project. The VSD
   database contains information on >1 million children enrolled in four
   West Coast health maintenance organizations (HMOs).
   Results. During 1993 through 1996 a total of 234 physician-diagnosed KS
   patients were reported in the 4 HMOs; 152 (65.0\%) were boys and 195
   (83.3\%) were <5 years of age. The incidence of KS among children <5
   years of age in the HMOs ranged from 9.0 to 19.1 per 100 000 person
   years. KS incidence was higher among boys in 3 of the sites. In the 2
   sites with the highest number of KS patients, a seasonal occurrence of
   KS in winter and early spring was observed. Overall 226 (96.6\%) of the
   KS patients were reported to have been hospitalized; hospitalization
   rates for children <5 years of age ranged from 9.0 to 16.8 per 100 000
   person years.
   Conclusions. The incidence of KS in the HMOs as similar to that reported
   in other population-based studies in the United States and higher than
   estimates for Australia and several European countries.}},

Title = {{Role of the cerebellar flocculus region in cancellation of the VOR
   during passive whole body rotation}},

Abstract = {{A series of studies were carried out to investigate the role of the
   cerebellar flocculus and ventral paraflocculus in the ability to
   voluntarily cancel the vestibuloocular reflex (VOR). Squirrel monkeys
   were trained to pursue moving visual targets and to fixate a head
   stationary or earth stationary target during passive whole body rotation
   (WBR). The firing behavior of 187 horizontal eye movement-related
   Purkinje (Pk) cells in the flocculus region was recorded during smooth
   pursuit eye movements and during WBR. Half of the Pk cells encountered
   were eye velocity Pk cells whose firing rates were related to eye
   movements during smooth pursuit and WBR. Their sensitivity to eye
   velocity during WBR was reduced when a visual target was not present,
   and their response to unpredictable steps in WBR was delayed by 80-100
   ms, which suggests that eye movement sensitivity depended on visual
   feedback. They were insensitive to WBR when the VOR was canceled. The
   other half of the Purkinje cells encountered were sensitive to eye
   velocity during pursuit and to head velocity during VOR cancellation.
   They resembled the gaze velocity Pk cells previously described in rhesus
   monkeys. The head velocity signal tended to be less than half as large
   as the eye velocity-related signal and was observable at a short
   (approximate to 40 ms) latency when the head was unpredictably
   accelerated during ongoing VOR cancellation. Gaze and eye velocity type
   Pk cells were found to be intermixed throughout the ventral
   paraflocculus and flocculus. Most gaze velocity Pk cells (76\%) were
   sensitive to ipsilateral eye and head velocity, but nearly half (48\%)
   of the eye velocity Pk cells were sensitive to contralateral eye
   velocity. Thus the output of flocculus region is modified in two ways
   during cancellation of the VOR. Signals related to both ipsilateral and
   contralateral eye velocity are removed, and in approximately half of the
   cells a relatively weak head velocity signal is added. Unilateral
   injections of muscimol into the flocculus region had little effect on
   the gain of the VOR evoked either in the presence or absence of visual
   targets. However, ocular pursuit velocity and the ability to suppress
   the VOR by fixating a head stationary target were reduced by
   approximately 50\%. These observations suggest that the flocculus region
   is an essential part of the neural substrate for both visual
   feedback-dependent and nonvisual mechanisms for canceling the VOR during
   passive head movements.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce the notion of weakly approaching sequences of

   weak convergence of distributions. The main difference is that the
   suggested notion does not demand the existence of a limit distribution.
   A similar definition for conditional (random) distributions is
   presented. Several properties of weakly approaching sequences are given.
   The tightness of some of them is essential. The Cramer-Levy continuity
   theorem for weak convergence is generalized to weakly approaching
   sequences of (random) distributions. It has several applications in
   statistics and probability. A few examples of applications to resampling
   are given.}},

Abstract = {{Statement of problem. The low resistance to corrosion is the major
   problem related to the use of copper-aluminum alloys.
   Purpose. This in vitro and in vivo study evaluated the corrosion of 2
   copper-aluminum alloys (Cu-Al and Cu-Al-Zn) compared with a
   nickel-chromium alloy.
   Material and methods. For the in vitro test, specimens were immersed in
   the following 3 corrosion solutions: artificial saliva, 0.9\% sodium
   chloride, and 1.0\% sodium sulfide. For the in vivo test, specimens were
   embedded in complete dentures, so that one surface was left exposed. The
   3 testing sites were (1) close to the oral mucosa (partial self-cleaning
   site), (2) surface exposed to the oral cavity (self-cleaning site), and
   (3) specimen bottom surface exposed to the saliva by means of a
   tunnel-shaped perforation (non-self-cleaning sire).
   Results. Almost no corrosion occurred with the nickel-chromium alloy,
   fur either the in vitro or in vivo test. On the other hand, the 2
   copper-aluminum-based alloys exhibited high corrosion in the sulfide
   solution. These same alloys also underwent. high corrosion in
   non-self-cleaning sites for the in vivo test, although minimal attack
   was observed in self-cleaning sites.
   Conclusion, The nickel-chromium alloy presented high resistance to
   corrosion. Both copper-aluminum alloys showed considerable corrosion in
   the sulfide solution and clinically in the non-self-cleaning site.
   However, in self-cleaning sites these 2 alloys slid not show substantial
   corrosion.}},

Abstract = {{The job exposure matrix (JEM) has been employed to assign cumulative
   exposure to workers in many epidemiological studies. In these studies,
   where quantitative data are available, all workers with the same job
   title and duration are usually assigned similar cumulative exposures,
   expressed in mg m(-3) x years, However, if the job is composed of
   multiple tasks, each with its own specific exposure profile, then
   assigning all workers within a job the same mean exposure can lead to
   misclassification of exposure, This variability of exposure within job
   titles is one of the major weaknesses of JEMs. A method is presented for
   reducing the variability in the JEM methodology, which has been called
   the task exposure matrix (TEM), By summing the cumulative exposures of a
   worrier over all the tasks worked within a job title, it is possible to
   address the variability of exposure within the job title, and reduce
   possible exposure misclassification. The construction of a TEM is
   outlined and its application in the context of a study in the primary
   aluminium industry is described. The TEM was found to assign
   significantly different cumulative exposures to the majority of workers
   in the study, compared,vith the JEM and the degree of difference in
   cumulative exposure between the JEM and the TEM varied greatly between
   contaminants. (C) 2000 British Occupational Hygiene Society, Published

   account for a high proportion of the low-latitude vegetation change

Abstract = {{Background: The administration of salbutamol is permitted only by
   inhalation by the international Olympic Committee (IOC) for the
   management of asthma and exercise-induced asthma in athletes. The
   establishment of criteria to distinguish between the IOC authorized use
   (inhaled) and the IOC prohibited use (oral) of salbutamol appeared
   possible using simultaneous evaluation of variables based on the
   concentration of nonconjugated enantiomers of salbutamol excreted in
   urine.
   Methods: Urine was collected from asthmatic and nonasthmatic swimmers
   who had received various preexercise doses of oral (five doses of 4 mg)
   or inhaled (two doses of 100 mu g) salbutamol. Urine was also obtained
   from subjects who had received the maximum dosage of inhaled salbutamol
   advisable for competing athletes to provide protection from
   exercise-induced asthma and treatment of asthma (1600 mu g in 24 h, 800
   mu g being in the last 4 h), All samples were analyzed to determine the
   total amount of unchanged salbutamol excreted in urine and the ratio
   between the S and R enantiomers.
   Results: The discriminant function D = -3.776 + 1.46 x 10(-3) \{{[}S(+)]
   + {[}R(-)]\} + 1.012 \{{[}S(+)]/{[}R(-)]\} can be used to classify data
   into two groups, inhaled and oral. The confirmatory criterion suggested
   (cutoff at D = 1.06, 4 SD from the mean D value of the inhaled
   distribution) has been verified in different sets of samples showing
   suspicious concentrations by conventional screening procedures in doping
   control. An 11.8\% false-negative (oral classified as inhaled) rate is
   assumed with the confirmatory criterion proposed, but virtually no false
   positives (inhaled classified as oral) are obtained (<1 in 33 000).
   Conclusions: The overall procedure recommended is to screen all samples
   and to apply the confirmation criterion proposed to samples showing free
   racemic salbutamol concentrations >500 9 mu g/L by gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry or free + conjugated racemic salbutamol
   concentrations >1400 mu g/L by ELISA. (C) 2000 American Association for

   packet radio systems in terms of increased throughput and battery

   constitutive expression of crmA did not diminish the extent of
   resveratrol-induced apoptosis, Furthermore, a caspase-8-negative,
   Fas-resistant Jurkat cell line was sensitive to resveratrol-induced
   apoptosis which could be strongly inhibited in the Jurkat as well as in
   the CEM cell line by z-VAD-fmk and z-IETD-fmk. The almost complete
   inhibition by z-IETD-fmk and the lack of inhibition by crmA suggested
   caspase-6 to be the essential initiator caspase, Western blots revealed

Abstract = {{When designing wheelchairs for use as motor vehicle seats, special

   computer simulation techniques. A previously validated simulation model
   consisting of a powerbase wheelchair and a seated 50th-percentile male
   test dummy subjected to a 20g/30mph frontal impact were used for the
   study. Since such a wide range of seating systems are available,
   parametric analyses were conducted to evaluate the influence of surface
   stiffness and seat-back angle on wheelchair seat and back loading. Seat
   loading varied with stiffness, ranging from 819-3,273 lb., while
   seat-back loading was found to be between 1,427-2,691 lb., depending
   upon back stiffness and recline angle.}},

Volume = {{48}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the problem of localizing a source by means
   of a sensor array when the received signal is corrupted by
   multiplicative noise. This scenario is encountered, for example, in
   communications, owing to the presence of local scatterers in the
   vicinity of the mobile or due to wavefronts that propagate through
   random inhomogeneous media. Since the exact maximum likelihood (ML)
   estimator is computationally intensive, two approximate solutions are
   proposed, originating from the analysis of the high and low
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) cases? respectively First, starting with the
   no additive noise case, a very simple approximate hit (AML(1)) estimator
   is derived. The performance of the AML(1) estimator in the presence of
   additive noise is studied, and a theoretical expression for its
   asymptotic variance is derived. Its performance is shown to be close to
   the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for moderate to high SNR, Next, the low SNR
   case is considered, and the corresponding AML(2) solution is derived. It
   is shown that the approximate ML criterion can be concentrated with
   respect to both the multiplicative and additive noise powers, leaving
   out a two-dimensional (2-D) minimization problem instead of a
   four-dimensional (4-D) problem required by the exact ML. Numerical
   results illustrate the performance of the estimators and confirm the
   validity of the theoretical analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Most CNS pathologies are accompanied by the occurrence of activated,
   phagocytic microglial cells. We intended to investigate whether (1)
   isolated microglial cells removed from the CNS cytokine network sustain
   their capacity to acquire an activated phenotype when challenged with
   cellular or noncellular debris; and (2) different substrates lead to
   different patterns of microglial activation. It; was observed that
   although removed from their usual surroundings microglial cells preserve
   their ability to transform to an amoeboid morphology, form
   multinucleated giant cells, and enhance their expression of MHC class II
   when exposed to membranes of neuronal or glial origin. Furthermore,
   cellular substrates derived from primary hippocampal neuronal cultures,
   neuroblastic cells (B50), or glial cells were all able to induce similar
   morphological changes and enhanced expression of MHC, class II. In
   contrast, phagocytosis of Latex beads induced an amoeboid morphology but
   no increase in the expression of immunologically relevant molecules.
   Interferon-p (IFN-p), a substance clinically used in the treatment of
   the relapsing-remitting form of multiple sclerosis, was shown to inhibit
   the phagocytosis-induced upregulation of MHC-class II. In summary,
   phagocytic microglial cells are independent from the CNS cytokine
   network in their transition from a resting to an activated phenotype;
   and different cellular substrates, regardless whether they are of
   neuronal, glial, or even malignant origin, result in similar
   morphological and functional changes. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Postvitellogenic follicles of freshwater perch Anabas testudineus
   incubated with {[}H-3]pregnenolone as exogenous precursor produced
   several metabolites, including 17 alpha,20
   beta-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (DHP) and 5 beta-pregnane-3 alpha,17
   alpha,20 beta-triol (5 beta-3 alpha,17 alpha,20 beta-P). These were
   identified by chromatography, microchemical reactions, and
   crystallization to constant specific activity. Following stimulation
   with fish (perch) pituitary extract (FPE) there was significant high
   production of DHP and 5 beta-3 alpha,17 alpha,20 beta-P, concomitant
   with a high percentage of germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD). Inhibitor
   of steroidogenesis (trilostane) and inhibitors of protein synthesis
   (cycloheximide and actinomycin-D) completely blocked FPE-induced
   pregnenolone metabolism and oocyte maturation. The effectiveness of
   various C-21 steroids in inducing GVBD was examined. Results indicate
   that DHP was the mast potent inducer of GVBD than other structurally
   related C-21 steroids. In intact follicles, FPE-stimulated production of
   DHP was shown to be mediated through the adenylate cyclase-cAMP pathway.
   Addition of IBMX or forskolin, which increases the endogenous cAMP
   level, as well as directly supplementing dbcAMP to the incubation
   medium, had no inhibitory effect on DHP-induced GVBD in the intact
   follicles. But all these agents were shown to inhibit GVBD in fully
   denuded oocytes. This study provides evidence that DHP, produced by
   postvitellogenic follicles through the adenylate cyclase-cAMP pathway,
   is the maturation-inducing steroid in freshwater perch and that the role
   played by cAMP in the induction of GVBD in intact follicles is different
   from that in the denuded oocytes. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{This study was undertaken to characterize the antigenic determinants
   recognized by the autoantibodies of patients with ocular cicatricial
   pemphigoid (OCP), OCP is a subepithelial, blistering, autoimmune disease
   that mainly affects the conjunctiva and other mucous membranes. We
   previously demonstrated that a cDNA clone, isolated from a keratinocyte
   expression library by using immunoaffinity-purified OCP autoantibody,
   encoded the cytoplasmic domain of beta (4) integrin subunit, Our
   subsequent studies showed that sera from all the OCP patients that were
   tested recognize the human beta (4) integrin subunit, To identify the
   prevalent epitopes of the anti-beta (4) autoantibodies of OCP, we have
   used cell lines transfected with vectors encoding a wild-type beta (4)
   subunit, a tailless beta (4) subunit, or a beta (4) subunit lacking the
   extracellular domain. Nontransfected cell lines were used as controls.
   Lysates from these cell lines were analyzed with OCP sera, IgG fractions
   from OCP sera, and immunoaffinity-purified OCP autoantibodies. Abs to
   extracellular and cytoplasmic domains of human beta (4) integrin were
   used as positive controls, whereas normal human sera and normal human
   IgG fractions were used as negative controls. The reactivity of OCP Abs
   was determined by using immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and FAGS
   analysis. The results of this study indicate that OCP sera, OCP Ige
   fractions, and immunoaffinity-purified OCP autoantibodies react with the
   intracellular and not the extracellular domain of human beta (4)
   integrin subunit. In vitro cell culture experiments demonstrated that
   OCP autoantibody binds to the cytoplasm of the cells. The relevance of
   these findings to the pathogenesis of OCP is discussed.}},

Volume = {{79}},

Abstract = {{Time-diary data from representative samples of American adults show that
   the number of overall hours of domestic labor (excluding child care and
   shopping) has continued to decline steadily and predictably since 1965.
   This finding is mainly due to dramatic declines among women (both in and
   out of the pain labor market), who have net their housework hours almost
   in half since the 1960s: about half of women's 12-hour-per-week decline
   can be accounted for by compositional shifts - such as increased labor
   force participation, later marriage, and fewer children. In contrast,
   men's housework time has almost doubled during this period (to the point
   where men were responsible for a third of housework in the 1990s), and
   only about 15\% of their five-hour-per-week increase can be attributed
   to compositional factors. Parallel results on gender differences in
   housework were obtained from the National Survey of Families and
   Households estimate data, even though these produce figures 50\% higher
   than diary data. Regression results examining factors related to wives'
   and husbands' housework hours show more support for the
   time-availability and relative-resource models of household production
   than for the gender perspective, although there is some support for the
   latter perspective as well.}},

Abstract = {{Several isolates of the entomopathogenic Metarhizium anisopliae that

   The isolates were also characterised genetically by RAPD and VCG.
   Similarly sized dsRNA, as visualised by electrophoresis, were not always

   electrophoretic banding patterns is an unreliable method of dsRNA
   characterisation. Several isolates, but not all, harbouring multiple
   dsRNA patterns, including a 1.8 and 2.0 kbp doubler, also showed
   homologies to strains harbouring only the dsRNA banding doubler. This
   suggests that mixed infections of different dsRNA elements are found in
   M. anisopliae. Genetically similar fungi, based on RAPD banding patterns
   and vegetative compatibility, were more likely to harbour genetically
   related dsRNA. The findings suggested that dsRNA elements in M.

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to identify any rheological effects that
   are consistent with the presence of sparse levels of long chain
   branching (LCB) in three commercial metallocene-catalyzed polyethylenes
   (MCPE) all of the same melt flow index of 1.0. Two Dow INSITE MCPEs with
   apparently varying levels of LCB of approximately 0.17 and 0.57/10 000
   carbon atoms and one Exxon EXXPOL MCPE with no LCB were studied. The
   breadth of distribution as determined by M (w) / M (n) of the three
   samples was 2.11 for the Exxon and one of the Dow samples, and 2.42 for
   the other Dow sample that had the highest degree of LCB. The MCPE with
   the highest branching seemed to have a slightly higher molecular weight
   tail in the distribution. Both the Dow samples had significantly higher
   how activation energies than the Exxon sample, consistent with the
   presence of LCB, but this method could not distinguish between the two
   branched polymers. The differences in M (w) could also not account for
   the appreciably higher zero-shear viscosities of the branched samples
   relative to the linear sample. Despite the differences in M (w) and LCB
   content in the two Dow samples, they exhibited almost identical shear
   how curves at temperatures between 120 and 170 degrees C. They also
   exhibited very similar shear stress growth behavior. Under constant
   extension rate deformation, the two samples with LCB showed a
   significant degree of strain hardening relative to the linear sample.
   Comparison between the two Dow samples revealed that the sample with the
   higher degree of LCB showed a greater degree of strain-hardening
   behavior. The extensional behavior is consistent with the LCB content
   determined by means of solution light scattering. (C) 2000 The Society

Abstract = {{The surgical treatment of thoracic kyphosis frequently requires an
   anterior release, which can be carried out by an open or endoscopic
   technique. This study concerns the reference points which are essential
   from the anatomic view for minimizing the operative risks. Furthermore
   we wanted to find the most convenient video-assisted thoracoscopic
   surgery (VATS) technique for transection of the anterior longitudinal
   ligament (ALL). Transection of the ALL, as well as discectomy, was
   performed using this technique. The extensive anatomic dissection of 12
   fresh cadavers was performed to define possible technical errors and
   surgical complications. The development of new instruments has made the
   VATS approach to the ALL a viable alternative to open procedures. With
   the help of a standardized technique, the isolated thoracoscopic
   ligamentous transection required less time than the comparable open
   procedure. The anatomic study showed, that in no case was a ligation of
   the intercostal or segmental vessels necessary as part of the approach
   to the spine, once an adequate mobilization of the esophagus and azygos
   vein had been carried out. The risk of an ischemic lesion of the spinal
   cord was thereby reduced. The thoracoscopic, limited anterior release
   consisting of a multilevel transection of the ALL proved to be a rapid
   and reliable procedure. Our anatomic studies provides suitable the

   Mean (SD) intubation time for the video-optical stylet was 20.4 (7.7) s
   and for the malleable stylet 10.2 (3.3) s (p < 0.01). With the
   video-optical stylet the trachea was correctly intubated in all 225
   attempts; with the malleable stylet 14 (19.6\%) oesophageal and 44
   (19.6\%) endobronchial intubations occurred (p < 0.01). The

Abstract = {{This study tests the reliability and validity of the European
   Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) head and neck
   cancer module (QLQ-H\&N35) and version 3.0 of the EORTC Core
   Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) in 622 head and neck cancer patients from 12
   countries. The patients completed the QLQ-C30, the QLQ-H\&N35 and a
   debriefing questionnaire before antineoplastic treatment or at a
   follow-up. 232 patients receiving treatment completed a second
   questionnaire after treatment. Compliance was high and the questionnaire
   was well accepted by the patients. Multitrait scaling analysis confirmed
   the proposed scale structure of the QLQ-H\&N35. The QLQ-H\&N35 was
   responsive to differences between disease status, site and patients with
   different Karnofsky performance status, and to changes over time. The
   new physical functioning scale (with a four-point response format) of
   version 3.0 of the QLQ-C30 was shown to be more reliable than previous
   versions. Thus, the QLQ-H\&N35, in conjunction with the VLQ-C30, appears
   to be reliable, valid and applicable to broad multicultural samples of
   head and neck cancer patients. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this article, we analyse whether Zimbabwe's structural adjustment
   programme (ESAP), implemented from 1991 to 1995, contributed to an
   increase in total factor productivity in the manufacturing sector. To
   evaluate productivity we first estimate indexes of total factor
   productivity for 31 manufacturing sub-sectors for the period 1980-1995.
   We then use econometric methods to rest for the effects of trade reform
   and other variables related to ESAP. In general the growth rates vary
   greatly both over time and across sectors. The overall impression is
   that there was no growth in total factor productivity on average during
   the whole period of ESAP, although during the last two years most
   sub-sectors experienced increases in total factor productivity. The main
   result of the econometric analysis is that none of the variables used as
   direct measures of trade liberalisation influenced productivity growth,
   but import growth had some influence. An interesting finding is that
   foreign aid inflows had a strong, positive impact on productivity
   growth.}},

Volume = {{48}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: Prescriptions of sedatives, hypnotics, and antianxiety
   medications have decreased over the past 15 years. However, racial
   differences have not been well investigated in controlled analyses.
   DESIGN: A prospective cohort study.
   SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: The authors analyzed data from a
   community-based, biracial cohort of older adults (n = 4000 at baseline)
   followed for 10 years to determine sociodemographic and health
   characteristics associated with the use of these medications between
   1986 and 1996.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Information about sedative, hypnotic, and
   antianxiety medication use and demographic and health characteristics
   was obtained from a race-stratified, probability-based sample of black
   and white community-dwelling older adults in the Piedmont region of
   North Carolina during four in-person interviews spanning 10 years.
   Descriptive statistics were calculated. Logistic regression was used for
   the final models.
   RESULTS: A total of 13.3\% of the subjects were taking these medications
   in 1986, with the frequency of use declining only to 11.8\% in 1996
   despite the cohort aging 10 years. Correlates of use at baseline were
   female gender, white race, depressive symptoms, poor self-rated health,
   impaired physical function, and health services use. These correlates
   persisted for each of the three follow-up waves of the survey. In 1996,
   the odds for being white and using these medications was 4.70 in
   controlled analyses.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite the overall decline in the use of sedative,
   hypnotics, and antianxiety agents in the general population in recent
   years, over the 10 years of this survey, an aging cohort continued to
   use these medications at a frequency greater than the general population
   and did not demonstrate a significant decline in use. Factors unrelated
   to health status, specifically being white, were among the strongest
   correlates of use throughout the years of follow-up.}},

Abstract = {{Allergic responses to Aspergillus species exacerbate asthma and cystic
   fibrosis, The natural defense against live Aspergillus fumigatus spores
   or conidia depends on the recruitment and activation of mononuclear and
   polymorphonuclear leukocytes, events that are dependent on chemotactic
   cytokines, in this study, we explored the relative contribution of the
   monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 receptor, CCR2, in the pulmonary
   response to A, fumigatus conidia, Following sensitization to soluble A,
   fumigatus Ags, mire larking CCR2 due to targeted deletion were markedly
   more susceptible to the injurious effects of an intrapulmonary challenge
   with live conidia compared with mice that expressed CCR2 or CCR2(+/+).
   CCR2(-/-) mice exhibited a major defect in the recruitment of
   polymorphonuclear cells, but these mice also had significantly more
   eosinophils and lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage samples. CCR2(-/)-
   mice also had significant increases in serum levels of total IgE and
   whole lung levels of IL-5, IL-13, eotaxin, and RANTES compared with
   CCR2(+/+) mice, Airway inflammation, hyper-responsiveness to spasmogens,
   and subepithelial fibrosis were significantly enhanced in CCR2(-/-) mice
   compared with CCR2(+/+) mice after the conidia challenge. Thus, these
   findings demonstrate that CCR2 plays an important role in the immune
   response against A. fumigatus, thereby limiting the allergic airway
   inflammatory and remodeling responses to this fungus.}},

Abstract = {{Permeable reactive barriers are an emerging alternative to traditional
   pump and treat systems for groundwater remediation. This technique has
   progressed rapidly over the past decade from laboratory bench-scale
   studies to full-scale implementation. Laboratory studies indicate the
   potential for treatment of a large number of inorganic contaminants,
   including As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Se, Tc, U, V, NO3, PO4
   and SO4. Small-scale field studies have demonstrated treatment of Cd,
   Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, NO3, PO4 and SO4. Permeable reactive barriers
   composed of zero-valent iron have been used in fill-scale installations
   for the treatment of Cr, U, and Tc. Solid-phase organic carbon in the
   form of municipal compost has been used to remove dissolved constituents
   associated with acid-mine drainage, including SO4, Fe, Ni, Co and Zn.
   Dissolved nutrients, including NO3 and PO4, have been removed from

Abstract = {{Aim. Analysis of fiber type composition and fiber size of extensor
   digitorum. longus (EDL) muscle in rats during 30 days of denervation.
   Methods. Fiber types were defined immunohistochemically using monoclonal
   antibodies specific for slow (type I) and fast fibers (type IIA, IIX,
   and IIB). Antibodies were applied on transverse sections of denervated
   extensor digitorum longus muscles 6, 12, and 30 days after denervation.
   Cross sectional area of muscle fibers was analyzed morphometrically by
   computerized image analysis.
   Results. Control EDL muscle was composed of 41\% of type IIB, 32\% of
   IIA, 23\% of IIX, and 4\% of type I muscle fibers. The most profound
   effect of denervation was observed 30 days after the transection of the
   sciatic nerve. Denervation decreased the percentage of both type IIB and
   type IIX muscle fibers to 36\% and 13\% of the control muscle,
   respectively (p<0.001 for both), and increased the percentage of types
   IIA and type I muscle fibers to 42\% and 9\% of the control,
   respectively (p<0.001 for both). Morphometric analysis revealed
   progressive atrophy of all fast muscle fibers, which started 6 days
   after denervation (p<0.001). Thirty days after the sciatic nerve
   transection, a strong reduction in fiber size of type TIA, IIX, and IIB
   muscle fibers was observed (p<0.001 for each type). Type I muscle fibers
   initially showed the reduction in fiber size (p < 0.001) but regained
   the size of control fibers until day 30.
   Conclusion. Denervation decreased the percentage of type IIX and IIB
   muscle fibers, with concomitant increase in type IIA and type I muscle
   fibers. The reduction in fiber size was observed in type IIA, IIX, and
   IIB muscle fibers.}},

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{177}},

Abstract = {{Swelling-activated Cl- currents (I-Cl.swell) have been characterized in
   a mouse renal inner medullary collecting duct cell line (mIMCD-K2).
   Currents activated by exposing the cells to hypotonicity exhibited
   characteristic outward rectification and time- and voltage dependent
   inactivation at positive potentials and showed an anion selectivity of
   I- > Br- > Cl- > Asp(-). NPPB (100 mu M) inhibited the current in a
   voltage independent manner, as did exposure to 10 mu M tamoxifen and 500
   mu M niflumic acid (NFA), In contrast, DIDS (100 mu M) blocked the
   current with a characteristic voltage dependency. These characteristics
   of I-Cl.swell in mIMCD-K2 cells are essentially identical to those of
   heterologously expressed cardiac CLC-3,
   A defining feature of CLC-3 is that activation of PKC by PDBu inhibits
   the conductance. In mIMCD-K2 cells preincubation with PDBu (100 nM)
   prevented the activation of I-Cl.swell by hypotonicity, However, PDBu
   inhibition of I-Cl.swell was reversed after PDBu withdrawal, but this
   was refractory to subsequent PDBu inhibition. Activation of either the
   cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) or Ca2+
   activated Cl- conductance (CaCC), which are coexpressed in mIMCD-K2
   cells prior to PDBu treatment, abolished the PDBu inhibition of
   I-CI.swell. Control of I-CI.swell by PKC therefore depends on the
   physiological status of the cell.
   In intact mIMCD-K2 layers in Ussing chambers, forskolin stimulation of
   an inward short-circuit current (due to transepithelial Cl- secretion
   via apical CFTR) was inhibited by cell swelling upon hypotonic exposure
   at the basolateral surface. Activation of I-Cl.swell is therefore
   capable of regulating transepithelial Cl- secretion and suggests that
   I-Cl.swell is located at the basolateral membrane. PDBu exposure prior
   to or during hypotonic challenge was ineffective in reversing the
   swelling-activated inhibition of Cl- secretion, but tamoxifen (100 mu M)
   abolished the hypotonic inhibition of forskolin-stimulated short-circuit
   current (I-sc).
   RT-PCR analysis confirmed expression of mRNA for members of the CLC
   family, including both CLC-2 and 3, in the mIMCD-K2 cell line.}},

Abstract = {{A complete screening of the CFTR gene by DGGE and DNA sequencing was
   performed in patients with sarcoidosis. In 8/26 cases, missense and
   splicing CFTR gene mutations were found, a significant difference over
   controls (9/89) from the same population (P = 0.014). The odds ratio for
   a person with a CFTR gene mutation to develop the disease is 3.95 (1.18
   < OR < 13.26). Seven different CFTR gene mutations were observed: R75Q,
   R347P, 621 + 3 A/G, 1898 + 3 A/G, L997F, G1069R, and a novel mutation
   which was detected in this study, 1991V. R75Q mutation was present in
   3/26 patients, a significant increase (P = 0.01) in cases over controls,
   indicating its preferential association with sarcoidosis. A trend
   towards disease progression was observed in patients with CFTR gene
   mutations compared to patients without mutations. These data suggest
   that CFTR gene mutations predispose to the development of sarcoidosis.}},

Abstract = {{Premature loss of radiomarkers is a problem in many telemetry studies.
   We describe and report retention rates for 4 radiocollar designs used on
   eastern cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus), January 1997 to

   These 4 designs are modifications of a collar developed by Advanced
   Telemetry Systems, Inc., and include a nylon collar with a single
   fastener (NSF), nylon collar with a double fastener (NDF), neoprene
   collar with a double fastener (NPDF), and modified neoprene collar with
   a double fastener (MNPDF). We estimated 90-day retention rates in a
   failure-time context to evaluate collar loss. Retention rate differed
   among collar designs (P<0.001) and was influenced by collar material
   (P<0.001) but not number of fasteners (P>0.05). Neoprene collars had
   greater 90-day retention rates (NPDF=86.15\%, MNPDF=100.0\%) than nylon
   collars (NSF=29.4\%, NDF=25.5\%). Reasons for collar loss were chewed,
   slipped, fastener pulled through collar, or collar-related mortality and
   injury. We recommend the MNPDF as the best design because of the high
   retention rate and well-positioned antenna.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the behavior of medullary respiratory neurons in cats
   under pentobarbitone anesthesia, vagotomized, paralysed, and
   artificially ventilated to elucidate neural mechanisms underlying apnea
   and poststimulatory respiratory depression induced by superior laryngeal
   nerve (SLN) stimulation Inspiratory neurons were completely inhibited
   during SLN stimulation and poststimulatory apnea. During recovery of
   inspiratory activity, augmenting inspiratory neurons were depressed,
   decrementing inspiratory neurons were excited, and late inspiratory
   neurons displayed unchanged bursts closely locked to the end of the
   inspiratory phase. Augmenting expiratory neurons were either silenced or
   displayed different levels of tonic activity during SLN stimulation;
   some of them were clearly activated. These expiratory neurons displayed
   activity during poststimulatory apnea, before the onset of the first
   recovery phrenic burst. Postinspiratory or decrementing expiratory
   neurons were activated during SLN stimulation; their discharge continued
   with a decreasing trend during poststimulatory apnea. The results
   support the three-phase theory of rhythm generation and the view that
   SLN stimulation provokes a postinspiratory apnea that could represent
   the inhibitory component of respiratory reflexes of laryngeal origin,
   such as swallowing. In addition, because a subpopulation of augmenting
   expiratory neurons displays activation during SLN stimulation, the
   hypothesis can be advanced that not only postinspiratory, or
   decrementing expiratory neurons, but also augmenting expiratory neurons
   may be involved in the genesis of apnea and poststimulatory phenomena.
   Finally, the increase in the activity of decrementing inspiratory
   neurons after the end of SLN stimulation may contribute to the
   generation of poststimulatory respiratory depression by providing an
   inhibitory input to bulbospinal augmenting inspiratory neurons.}},

Abstract = {{1. The present study was designed to assess the participation of
   extrarenal tissue renin-angiotensin systems (RAS) in pressure
   homeostasis in sheep.
   2. The effect of the administration of an angiotensin II type 1 receptor
   antagonist (losartan; 30 mg/kg, i.v.) on mean arterial blood pressure
   (MABP) was investigated in tight intact (controls) and 10
   binephrectomized sheep haemodialysed every 2 days for 10 days.
   3. In control sheep, losartan decreased blood pressure and this decrease
   was significantly more marked after furosemide-induced water and salt
   depletion. After nephrectomy and throughout the anephric period,
   losartan lost its hypotensive effect, while the plasma renin
   concentration fell to undetectable levels, Baseline MABP became
   significantly lower than at the beginning of the anephric period after 7
   days. The inability to maintain blood pressure after several
   volume-depleting haemodialysis sessions proved that an efficient system
   for blood pressure regulation was lacking after nephrectomy,
   4. Renin gene expression measured by reverse transcription-polymerase
   chain reaction was found in liver, adrenal and arterial wall tissue.
   Neither nephrectomy nor sodium depletion enhanced this tissue renin gene
   expression.
   5. In conclusion, the present work allows us to exclude an active role
   of extrarenal RAS in the maintenance of blood pressure. In addition,
   haemodialysis technology in nephrectomized sheep can he used as a good
   model for the study of extrarenal control of blood pressure.}},

Abstract = {{Some of the estuaries of the Basque Country (Northern Spain) have been
   areas of exploitation of clam populations, both by professional and
   illegal fishermen. There is a real possibility of overfishing, therefore
   the Department of Fisheries of the Basque Government needs to: (a)
   understand the situation relating to these populations; and (b) provide
   a tool to establish the most adequate management for the exploitation of
   clams.
   In order to simulate different alternatives for the exploitation, based
   upon scientific data on the population, the best tool available is a
   system dynamics model. Here the VENSIM(R) model was employed, utilising
   data on clam populations: summer stock in the Plentzia estuary, in 1998;
   winter stock in 1999; biomass in summer and winter; area occupied by the
   species; length and weight class distribution; number of fishermen; mean
   of biomass captured by the fishermen; natural mortality, by length
   class; maturation; fertility rate; etc. There exist previous experiences
   in modelling clam exploitation in the Mundaka estuary (1). These
   experiences have been improved in this paper.
   Following validation of the model, after running it for 1 and 10 years,
   some cases were simulated. This analysis was undertaken in order to
   establish the effect of modifying the number of fishermens, the
   aperture-close season of captures, and the minimum sustainable biomass.
   This approach is an initial proposal, which tries to establish the
   sustainable exploitation of the clam populations in the Basque Country.}},

Abstract = {{Bill measurement is important in many feeding studies. Traditionally,
   two alternative bill measures have been proposed: bill length measured
   from the tip to skull (i.e., total culmen), mainly used in Europe, and
   bill length measured from the tip to the anterior edge of nostrils, used
   both in Europe and America. However, the correlation between both
   measures as well as the analysis of what they are in fact measuring have
   not been explored yet. The aim of this paper is to test in the Citril
   Finch (Serinus citrinella) whether measurement of bill length from the
   tip to the anterior edge of nostrils and total culmen are measuring
   different components of bill length (e.g., ramphotheca vs. premaxilla),
   and to assess which is the best measure in relation to their measurement
   error. This is specially relevant in granivorous birds for which total
   culmen length differs from ramphotheca length. The correlation between
   bill length to nostrils and total culmen was moderate (r = 0.75).
   Multiple regression of total culmen (dependent variable) on the bill
   components included ramphotheca length (R-2 = 52\%) and marginally
   premaxilla length to nostrils (R-2 change = 6\%, P = 0.06). When using
   bill length to nostrils as dependent variable it also included
   ramphotheca length (R-2 = 60\%) and premaxilla length to nostrils (R-2
   change = 16\%, P 0.001). Measurement error was low for bill length to
   nostrils (ME = 1.6\%) but high for total culmen (ME = 26.3\%), making
   the latter measure not reliable. The replicability of total culmen is
   probably decreased in granivorous birds, compared to other passerines,
   by the fact that in these species the abrupt edge of the ramphotheca
   differs from the point at which the culmen meets the skull, which
   hinders the location of the end of culmen. All of this highly recommends
   that, specially in granivorous birds, the length of bill should be
   measured from nostril. Our results also show that both bill length
   measures are mainly measuring ramphotheca.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose-We observed that the second application of
   cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients
   onto cerebral arterial segments in vitro produces a greater contraction
   than does the initial application. It was hypothesized that the
   difference between the first and second applications of SAH CSF was due
   to the activity of thrombin.
   Methods-Canine vertebrobasilar artery was removed under general
   anesthesia, cut into rings, and suspended in tissue culture baths so as
   to measure isometric tension. CSF was taken from patients 1 to 3 days
   after SAH via ventricular drains. CSF was administered in 10(-5) to
   10(-1) dilutions. The thrombin antagonist hirudin (5 U) was administered
   before CSF in some experiments. The arterial tension response to pure
   oxyhemoglobin (10(-4) to 3.2 g/dL) and thrombin (10(-4) to 3.2 U/mL),
   administered alone or in combination, was also examined.
   Results-Hirudin increased arterial tension generated on the initial
   application of SAH CSF but had no effect on the tension generated by the
   second application of the SAH CSF, suggesting that thrombin limits the
   tension generated by vasoconstrictive agents in the CSF. Thrombin and
   pure oxyhemoglobin administered together produced less tension than that
   generated in response to oxyhemoglobin administered alone; no additive
   response was observed by coadministering the 2 vasoconstrictive agents.
   Conclusions-In the presence of oxyhemoglobin, thrombin acts to reduce
   cerebral arterial tension. This interaction between thrombin and
   hemoglobin may account for the observation that the second application
   of CSF from SAH patients onto cerebral arterial segments in vitro
   produces a greater contraction than does the initial application.}},

Abstract = {{Forecasting the geomagnetic effects to technological systems on the
   ground requires rapid calculations of the electric and magnetic fields
   produced by the auroral electrojet. The electrojet is often modelled as
   a line current at a height of 100 km, but in reality it has a finite
   width and is typically spread over 5 degrees or 6 degrees of latitude.
   We show that the width of the electrojet can easily be included in
   electric and magnetic field calculations by assuming that the
   ionospheric current density has a Cauchy distribution with a half-width
   a, j(x)=(I/pi )a/(chi (2) + a(2)), at a height h. It is shown that the
   electric and magnetic fields produced at the surface of a layered earth
   by such a current are equivalent to the fields produced by a line
   current I at a height h + a. This equivalence, combined with the complex
   image method, leads to simple formulas that provide a method for fast
   calculation of the electric and magnetic fields that can affect
   ground-based systems. Crown Copyright (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Estimates of colonic transit times (CTT) through the three colonic
   segments, right colon, left colon, and rectosigmoid, are commonly based
   on radiopaque markers. For a given segment, CTT is usually calculated
   from just the number of markers visible in that segment on abdominal
   X-rays. This procedure is only strictly valid for the theoretical, but
   unrealistic, case of continuous marker ingestion (i.e., not for a single
   or once-daily ingestion). CTT was analyzed using the usual estimate of
   the mean CTT of one marker and also using a new, more realistic estimate
   based on the kinetic coefficients of a three-compartment colonic model.
   We directly compared our compartmental approach to classic CTT estimates
   by double-marker studies in six patients. We also retrospectively
   studied CTT in 148 healthy control subjects (83 males, 65 females) and
   1,309 subjects with functional bowel disorders (irritable bowel syndrome
   or constipation). Compared with the compartmental estimates, the classic
   approach systematically underestimates CTT in both populations, i.e., in
   patients and in healthy control subjects. The relative error could
   easily reach 100\% independent of the site of colonic transit delay. The
   normal values of total CTT are then 44.3 +/- 29.3 instead of 30.1 +/-
   23.6 h for males and 68.2 +/- 54.4 instead of 47.1 +/- 28.2 h for

   It was a novel pentaglycosylceramide of the neolactoseries terminated
   with the Gal(beta 1-4)Gal determinant which is not expressed in

Abstract = {{Dietary protein deficiency, common in elderly, is associated with
   decreased areal bone mineral density and plasma insulin-like growth
   factor I (IGF-I). To investigate the early adaptation of bone cells to
   protein restriction, B-month-old female rats were pair-fed with
   isocaloric 15\% (control) or 2.5\% casein diets for 14 days. Animals
   were then treated daily with rhIGF-I/IGFBP-3 (1:4, 2.5 mg IGF-I/kg BW)
   or with vehicle for 10 days. After double-labeling, proximal metaphysis
   and mid-diaphysis of the tibia were analyzed histomorphometrically.
   Plasma ostcocalcin, IGF-I, and urinary deoxypyridinoline were
   quantified. After 14 days of protein restriction, significant drops in
   plasma osteocalcin (13\%) and IGF-I (37\%), in periosteal formation
   (83\%) and mineral apposition (49\%) rates are observed, indicating a
   decreased osteoblast recruitment and activity. In cancellous bone, a
   significant decrease in active eroded surfaces (27\%) and osteoclast
   number (24\%) indicates a transient depression of resorption. In rats
   fed the 15\% casein diet, rhIGF-I/IGFBP-3 increases cancellous (42\%)
   and periosteal (600\%) formation rates, indicating an increased
   osteoblast recruitment. In protein-restricted rats, rhIGF-I/IGFBP-3
   fails to increase cancellous or periosteal bone formation and plasma
   osteocalcin is significantly lower than in 15\% casein+rhIGF-I/IGFBP-3
   rats. Protein restriction induces osteoblast resistance to
   rhIGF-I/IGFBP-3 in both bone envelopes. Low plasma IGF-I and osteoblast
   resistance to IGF-I, may contribute to the impaired periosteal
   formation.}},

Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{9}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The p53 tumour-suppressor protein is negatively regulated by HDM2.
   Recent reports indicate that the leucine-rich nuclear-export sequence
   (NES) of HDM2 enables it to shuttle to the cytoplasm, and that this
   activity is required for degradation of p53. However, it is unclear
   whether HDM2 is involved in nuclear export of p53, partly because p53
   has itself been shown to contain a functional NES within its
   tetramerization domain. Here we show that co-expression of HDM2 with
   green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged p53 causes redistribution of p53
   from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of the cell. This activity is
   dependent on binding of p53 to HDM2, and requires an intact p53 NES, but
   is independent of the HDM2 NES. A mutant of the HDM2 RING-finger domain
   that is unable to ubiquitinate p53 does not cause relocalization of p53,
   indicating that ubiquitin ligation or other activities of this region of
   HDM2 may be necessary for its regulation of p53 localization.}},

Title = {{Proportion of type 2 diabetes cases resulting from impaired fetal growth}},
Journal = {{DIABETES CARE}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1260-1264}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE - During the past decade, several researchers have
   demonstrated a higher risk of type 2 diabetes in relation to lower birth
   weight. This theory, referred to as the ``thrifty phenotype''
   hypothesis, postulates that impaired fetal growth predisposes
   individuals to the development of diabetes and other metabolic
   abnormalities. This article examines the importance of fetal growth in
   the etiology of diabetes by estimating the proportion of diabetes cases
   associated with this exposure.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - The importance of an exposure or its
   correlate as a potential cause of a disease can be assessed by
   estimating the proportion of cases that could he prevented if the
   exposure was eliminated from a defined population. This proportion is
   referred to as the population-attributable fraction (PAF). Published
   studies of the association between diabetes and birth weight were
   reviewed and selected for further analysis if data were presented that
   enabled PAP calculation. In addition, PAFs were calculated for higher
   birth weight cutoffs because researchers have postulated that the lowest
   birth weight category may not capture all cases of fetal growth
   retardation. Studies have shown that exposure classified in this broader
   manner can produce unbiased PAP estimates, even if many subjects are
   falsely classified as exposed.
   RESULTS - PAFs for the lowest birth weight category ranged from 0.01 to
   0.25. In this analysis, PAFs for diabetes did not exceed 0.35. In
   contrast, >50\% of diabetes cases in the First National Health and
   Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic Follow-Up Study were
   attributable to excess adiposity as reflected by a BMI of greater than
   or equal to 26 kg/m(2) (PAF >0.50).
   CONCLUSIONS - Impaired fetal growth or its correlates account for a
   minority (<0.50) of type 2 diabetes cases.}},

Abstract = {{This study is aimed at optimizing the design of surface facilities of an
   early production scheme for an onshore Abu Dhabi oil field. The current
   design of separation facilities is modular, and thus improvements in
   performance are possible with a better understanding of PVT properties
   of the oil produced. This is performed by optimizing the multistage
   separator process for the range of properties of oil processed by the
   facilities.
   This paper describes the characterization of the crude oil processed by
   the facility using the S-parameter Peng-Robinson Equations of state to
   describe the phase behavior and fluid properties using reservoir fluid
   data and an analysis of production data. After characterizing the fluids
   from each production well in the reservoir, the streams are mixed and
   the overall characterization of the total reservoir crude oil is used to
   optimize the design of the current facilities, This overall
   characterization of the crude oil is checked and compared to field
   analysis from the current operating facility.
   Current production facilities consist of one production separator
   followed by a free water knockout tank. Results show that optimum
   separation requires a multi-stage scheme versus the two-stage scheme
   being used now. Up to 2-3\% increase in oil volumes produced may be
   achieved by using an optimized 3-stage separator design consisting of
   high and medium pressure production separators followed by the free
   water knockout tank.}},

Volume = {{78}},

Abstract = {{Ultrasound estimates of marbling score were collected on 144 calves that
   averaged 219 d of age and 219 kg. Those estimates were correlated (r(2)
   =.32, P < .001) with carcass marbling at slaughter 252 d later. Receiver
   operating characteristic (ROC) analysis provides a method to determine
   critical operating points for selecting outcome groups with specified
   percentages of the desired quality grades. When an apriori estimate of
   the prevalence of Choice or premium choice can be made, the ROC
   procedures incorporate error rates to estimate the percentage of the
   herd that will be selected in an outcome group. A unique feature of the
   ROC output is the ability to conduct a cost/benefit analysis. The ROC
   analysis indicated that the initial marbling estimates were 78 +/- 4\%
   accurate in classifying future quality grade and predicting whether an
   animal would grade USDA Choice, A similar accuracy (76 +/- 4\%) was
   observed in predicting whether an animal would attain USDA Average
   Choice or higher (premium choice). A decision matrix was also examined
   in which sensitivity and specificity in predicting Choice were 90\% and
   46\%,, respectively. Relative values of those diagnostic measures were
   reversed in predicting premium choice (39\% and 86\%, respectively).
   Evaluation of the different methods indicated that ROC analysis may have
   advantages over either traditional regression analysis or contingency
   tables for evaluating ultrasound procedures.}},

Abstract = {{The paper attempts to develop a non-reductionistic and transdisciplinary
   view on human knowing in the light of the growing development of
   transdisciplinary practices and sciences. Medicine is one of the oldest;
   ecology and information science are some of the newer examples of
   radical transdisciplinarity. I discuss the lack of a recognized place
   and value of phenomenological knowledge in relation to the general
   mechanistic scientific ontology that still seems to be the only
   generally accepted background for the transdisciplinary areas to build
   on. Ontologically we cannot say much about reality except that it is
   very complex and dynamic, but still has structures and causal relations
   of a certain stability, which can be modelled mathematically. We further
   have to admit that there are aspects of reality that are beyond
   measuring. I suggest that the dualistic idea of transcendental and
   eternal mathematical natural laws and an algorithmic programme behind
   intelligence and language is rejected for its lack of ability to include
   the phenomenological and existential perspective of science and the
   practical knowledge beyond words. Instead I am promoting an
   epistemology, which sees science as only one aspect of our knowledge and
   sees human knowledge as going beyond language. An opening for the
   phenomenological aspect is then created in our modern scientistic and
   mechanistic metaphysics. I suggest a view of knowledge seen as
   self-organized signification systems based on metaphysical frameworks in
   social practice. The interpretation of sign in a systematized knowledge
   framework is actually where the medical sciences started in the
   classical Creek tradition of Hippocrates. This non-reductionistic
   framework promises to open towards a non-Cartesian transdisciplinary
   understanding of the basis for the generation and communication of
   knowledge in society without giving up what we have gained through the
   rigour and the methods of the sciences and the logic of philosophical
   analysis. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The irreversible mu-opioid antagonists beta-funaltrexamine (beta-FNA)
   and beta-chlornaltrexamine (beta-CNA) are important pharmacological
   tools but have a kappa-agonist activity and, in the latter case, low
   selectivity. This work examines whether clocinnamox (C-CAM) and the
   newer analog, methocinnamox (M-CAM), represent improved long-lasting
   antagonists for examining mu-opioid-mediated effects in vivo. beta-FNA,
   beta-CNA, C-CAM, and M-CAM were compared after systemic administration
   in mice and in vitro. beta-FNA and beta-CNA were effective agonists in
   the writhing assay, reversible by the kappa-antagonist
   norbinaltorphimine. Neither C-CAM nor M-CAM had agonist activity in
   vivo. M-CAM was devoid of agonist action at cloned opioid receptors. All
   four compounds depressed the dose-effect curve for the mu-agonist
   morphine in the warm-water tail-withdrawal test 1 h after
   administration; at 48 h, recovery was evident. In the writhing assay,
   the dose-effect curve for morphine was shifted in a parallel fashion in
   the order M-CAM >> C-CAM > beta-CNA greater than or equal to beta-FNA.
   In comparison with their ability to shift the dose-effect curve for
   bremazocine (kappa) and BW373U86 (delta), beta-CNA was the least
   mu-selective, followed by C-CAM < beta-FNA < M-CAM. M-CAM (1.8 mg/kg)
   produced a 74-fold increase in the ED50 of morphine while showing no
   effect on bremazocine or BW373U86 dose-response curves. In binding
   assays, C-CAM and M-CAM were 8-fold selective for mu- over
   kappa-receptors, whereas beta-FNA and beta-CNA were mu/delta-, but not
   mu/kappa selective. However, ex vivo binding assays confirmed the
   mu-receptor selectivity of M-CAM. M-CAM is thus a potent, long-lasting,
   and specific antagonist at mu-receptors in vivo that lacks confounding
   agonist actions.}},

Title = {{Effect of cultivar of white clover on plant morphology during the

Volume = {{43}},

Abstract = {{The establishment of white clover from seed is characterised by two
   distinct morphological growth forms, a seminal tap-rooted stage with
   radiating stolen systems lasting 1-2 years, followed by a clonal growth
   form. Transition of a plant from tap-rooted to clonal form occurs when
   the tap root and primary stem axis die, releasing a variable number of
   stolen systems as independent clonal plants. The purpose of this study
   was to investigate any effect different cultivars of white clover may
   have on the morphology of plants during the transition of populations
   from tap-rooted to clonal growth form when establishing in mixed
   pastures based on either perennial ryegrass or tall fescue. Cultivars
   studied ranged from small-leafed to large-leafed cultivars in the order
   of Prop, Prestige, Demand, Huia, Sustain, Le Bons, Kopu, and Aran.
   During the tap-rooted phase there were no differences between cultivars
   in shoot growth apart from the small-leafed cultivars (Prop, Prestige,
   Demand, and Huia) having a higher plant branching order and lower
   partitioning to leaf than the large-leafed cultivars (Sustain, Le Bons,
   Kopu, and Aran). After one year, tap-rooted plants were 4-5 times larger
   than plants in the subsequently formed clonal populations. Tap root
   death and fragmentation to form clonal plants commenced one year after
   sowing and initially occurred at a faster rate in small-leafed than in
   larger-leafed cultivars. By 15-18 months later, loss of all tap-rooted
   plants in all cultivars was complete. The mean characteristics of clonal
   plants and populations were similar for all cultivars, and similar to
   those reported in other studies. It took two years of differential
   grazing management to achieve the balance in plant DW structure reported
   in older pastures. The possible role of changes in plant form in
   cultivar performance is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{White matter lesions (WMLs) and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction
   are common in dementia. Both conditions may be a consequence of
   small-vessel disease, in which case the BBB damage would be suspected to
   be located to the WMLs. To further evaluate the nature of WMLs in
   dementia we examined 10 demented patients with WMLs, including 5 cases
   with elevated CSF/serum albumin ratios as an indication of BBB damage.
   An optimised gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced MRI technique was used including a
   double dose of Gd, a 30-min scan time after injection and analysis of
   the MR signal in the WMLs as a function overtime. Results showed no
   significant changes in MR signal in the WMLs after contrast
   administration. We conclude that WMLs are not connected to BBB damage to
   such a degree that is detectable with this method and that the elevated
   CSF albumin might have another origin. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger AG,

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: In vitro generation of dendritic cells (DCs) from human
   monocytes represents a promising tool in immunotherapy. However, it is
   not known whether the separation of DCs from monocytes induces tissue
   factor expression and therefore may trigger coagulation in patients
   receiving these DC preparations. The aim of this study is thus to
   analyze tissue factor expression on monocyte-derived DCs and to compare
   their ability to trigger thrombin generation to that of macrophages
   obtained from the same monocytes.
   STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Human monocytes are separated by leukapheresis
   and washed by using counterflow centrifugation in sterile,
   endotoxin-free conditions. Macrophages are grown from human monocytes in
   the presence of GM-CSF alone and immature DCs are grown in the presence
   of GM-CSF plus IL-4 for 5 days with fetal calf serum (IDC-FCS). Immature
   DCs are also grown from human monocytes for 7 days in the presence of
   GM-CSF plus IL-4 with human group AB serum (IDC-HS). The addition of
   prostaglandin E-2 and TNF alpha in this culture medium at Day 5 leads to
   mature DCs (MDC-HS). Tissue factor mRNA expression is studied by RT-PCR
   analysis. Tissue factor antigen is measured by ELISA in cell lysates and
   by direct flow cytometry. The procoagulant activity of intact cells is
   assessed by using an amidolytic assay or a chronometric assay.
   RESULTS: IDC-FCS express tissue factor mRNA and antigen and trigger
   thrombin generation. Procoagulant activity of IDC-FCS is dependent on
   both tissue factor expression and exposure to anionic phospholipid.
   Monocyte-derived macrophages cultured for 5 days with GM-CSF alone
   express lower levels of tissue factor mRNA, tissue factor antigen, and
   procoagulant activity than IDC-FCS. IDC-HS and MDC-HS also express high
   levels of tissue factor mRNA and antigen and support procoagulant
   activity.
   CONCLUSION: Monocyte-derived DCs express a high level of functional
   tissue factor and support procoagulant activity. This finding should be
   taken into account in clinical trials.}},

Abstract = {{We formulate a statistical model of the human core-temperature circadian
   rhythm in which the circadian signal is modeled as a van der Pol
   oscillator, the thermoregulatory response is represented as a
   first-order autoregressive process, and the evoked effect of activity is
   modeled with a function specific for each circadian protocol. The new
   model directly links differential equation-based simulation models and
   harmonic regression analysis methods and permits statistical analysis of
   both static and dynamical properties of the circadian pacemaker from
   experimental data. We estimate the model parameters by using numerically
   efficient maximum likelihood algorithms and analyze human
   core-temperature data from forced desynchrony, free-run, and
   constant-routine protocols. By representing explicitly the dynamical
   effects of ambient light input to the human circadian pacemaker, the new
   model can estimate with high precision the correct intrinsic period of
   this oscillator (similar to 24 h) from both free-run and forced
   desynchrony studies. Although the van der Pol model approximates well
   the dynamical features of the circadian pacemaker, the optimal dynamical
   model of the human biological clock may have a harmonic structure
   different from that of the van der Pol oscillator.}},

   Fluency measures included initial and excluded letter fluency and the

   mediator of age-related variance in incidental recall, and Uses for
   Objects Test performance added to the variance after controlling for

Abstract = {{Pseudomonas syringae pv, glycinea PG4180 causes bacterial blight of
   soybean and produces the phytotoxin coronatine (COR) in a
   temperature-dependent manner. COR consists of a polyketide, coronafacic
   acid (CFA), and an amino acid derivative, coronamic acid, and is
   produced optimally at 18 degrees C whereas no detectable synthesis
   occurs at 28 degrees C. We investigated the impact of temperature on
   PG4180 during compatible and incompatible interactions with soybean and
   tobacco plants, respectively. After spray inoculation, PG4180 caused
   typical bacterial blight symptoms on soybean plants when the bacteria
   were grown at 18 degrees C prior to inoculation but not when derived
   from cultures grown at 28 degrees C. The disease outcome was quantified
   by determination of bacterial populations in planta, The temperature
   effect was not observed when PG4180 was artificially infiltrated into
   soybean leaves, indicating that the pre-inoculation temperature and
   phytotoxin synthesis were important for bacterial invasion via natural
   plant openings, In the incompatible interaction, PG4180 elicited the
   hypersensitive response (HR) on tobacco plants regardless of the
   bacterial pre-inoculation temperature. However the HR was significantly
   delayed when tobacco plants were treated with cells of the
   CFA-overproducing derivative, PG4180,N9, which were derived from
   cultures grown at 18 degrees C, compared with parallels incubated at 28
   degrees C, CFA biosynthesis by PG4180,N9 was optimal at 18 degrees C and
   negligible at 28 degrees C. The impact of CFA synthesis on the HR was
   studied with different growth media, mutants, and transconjugants of
   PG4180, indicating that the amount of synthesized CFA but not that of
   COR influenced the outcome of the HR, Feeding experiments with purified
   coronafacoyl compounds suggested that the observed delay of the HR was
   mediated by CFA, shedding further light on CFA's putative role as a
   molecular mimic of the plant signaling molecule, jasmonic acid.}},

   specifically for neonatal hearing screening with transitory evoked
   otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE). In a second step, this system was
   investigated for its suitability to classify emissions, regardless of
   patient age. For the comparison measurements in 252 mainly adult
   patients, some with an acquired hearing impairment, were used. To adapt
   the pass/fail decision to the extended evaluation criteria, the false
   classifications from a first run with the new data were used for
   training. Thereafter the expert system, working with a wider data basis,
   classified the new data with a sensitivity that was increased by 4.8 \%
   to 97.2 \%, and a 2.0 \% improvement in specificity to 95.5 \% when
   classifying new data. These results, together with those of 97.3 \% and
   94.3 \% achieved with exclusively neonatal TEOAE: classification,

   constituted of alkali-reactive aggregates. These aggregates have quartz
   phases with internal flaws called silanols. AAR development within
   aggregate involve an increase of internal silanols number. To study this
   structural transformation, we have followed the evolution of X-ray
   diffraction peaks of quartz phase as a function to reaction degree.
   The flint aggregate shows high ray width at half medium which traduces
   the presence of internal silanols. As the reaction progress we observe a
   decrease of ray width at half medium and surface of diffraction peaks.
   We interpret this result like the transition of zones with internal
   flaws in amorphous zones. The best crystallized zones are progressively

Abstract = {{High-resolution medium-energy ion scattering (MEIS) has been used to
   investigate the segregation of arsenic and sulfur on the (100) oriented
   surface of a body-centered cubic Fe-9\% W(100) single crystal containing
   53 wt-ppm As and 10 wt-ppm S. The sensitivities of Auger electron
   spectroscopy (AES), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and MEIS to
   the presence of As on Fe or Fe-base alloy surfaces are discussed. At
   temperatures ranging from 800 to 1100 degrees C, both segregants compete
   for the available surface sites. Arsenic segregation dominates at
   temperatures around 800 degrees C, while S segregation is most
   pronounced at temperatures around 1000 degrees C. The total S and As
   coverage was found to be near 0.45 ML over the entire temperature range.
   Thermodynamic parameters, such as segregation free energies and
   interaction energies, have been determined utilizing the regular
   solution model proposed by Guttmann and McLean. Strong repulsive
   interactions between the segregants are found. MEIS structure analysis
   shows the segregated As and S atoms to be arranged 1.22-1.27 Angstrom
   above the topmost metal layer (depending on surface composition). The
   metal-to-metal layer distances show an oscillatory relaxation behavior
   with an expansion of the first-to-second metal layer (+ 0.05 Angstrom).
   With As and S on the surface, there is a strong depletion of W in the
   topmost two metal layers. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Objective: To examine intermanual differences in performing a clinical,
   visuoconstructional task. While many examiners have their hemiparetic
   patients complete visuospatial tasks with their nondominant hand,
   normative data have only been available based on dominant band
   performance. This study sought to determine normal differences in
   intermanual visuoconstructional performance.
   Design: A group of individuals with no history of neurologic disorder
   completed a visuoconstruction task with their dominant and nondominant
   hands. Intermanual differences were compared.
   Setting: General metropolitan community.
   Participants: Forty-four individuals with no history of psychiatric,
   neurologic, visual, or motor impairment. Mean age was 29 years. Mean
   education level was 16 years.
   Main Outcome Measure: Free-drawn clock drawings.
   Results: The intermanual difference was not significant (t(43) = 1.95, p
   = .06). Ninety-three percent scored within normal limits with their
   nondominant band.
   Conclusions: Use of the nondominant hand for clock drawing appears to be
   a reasonable alternative for those who are unable to use their dominant
   hand.}},

Abstract = {{The aerobic biodegradation of high concentrations of l-propanol and
   2-propanol (IPA) by a mixed microbial consortium was investigated.
   Solvent concentrations were one order of magnitude greater than any
   previously reported in the literature. The consortium utilized these
   solvents as their sole carbon source to a maximum cell density of 2.4 x
   10(9) cells ml(-1). Enrichment experiments with propanol or IPA as
   carbon sources were carried out in batch culture and maximum specific
   growth rates (mu(max)) calculated. At 20 degrees C, mu(max) values were
   calculated to be 0.0305 h(-1) and 0.1093 h(-1) on 1\% (v/v) IPA and
   l-propanol, respectively. Growth on propanol and IPA was carried out
   between temperatures of 10 degrees C and 45 degrees C. Temperature shock
   responses by the microbial consortium at temperatures above 45 degrees C
   were demonstrated by considerable cell flocculation. An increase in
   propanol substrate concentration from 1\% (v/v) to 2\% (v/v) decreased
   the mu(max) from 0.1093 h(-1) to 0.0715 h(-1). Maximum achievable
   biodegradation rates of propanol and IPA were 6.11 x 10(-3)\% (v/v)
   h(-1) and 2.72 x 10(-3)\% (v/v) h(-1), respectively. Generation of
   acetone during IPA commenced at 264 h and reached a maximum
   concentration of 0.4\% (v/v). The results demonstrate the potential of
   mixed microbial consortia in the bioremediation of solvent-containing
   waste streams.}},

Abstract = {{1. The aims of the present study were to assess: (i) the temporal
   relationships between hepatic lipid peroxidation, changes in the
   glutathione detoxification system and the onset/development of cirrhosis
   in CCl4-treated rats; and (ii) the effects of oral zinc administration
   on these parameters,
   2. Cirrhosis was induced in 120 rats by intraperitoneal injections of
   CCl4 twice a week over 9 weeks, One hundred and twenty additional
   animals were used as controls. Both groups were further subdivided to
   receive either a standard diet or one supplemented with zinc. Subsets of
   10 animals each were killed at weeks 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 9 from the start
   of the study.
   3. Induction of cirrhosis produced a decrease in the components of the
   hepatic glutathione anti-oxidant system: glutathione transferase
   activity decreased from Meek 1, the concentration of reduced glutathione
   (GSH) decreased from week 5 and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity
   decreased from week 7, This impairment was chronologically related to an
   increase in fret radical generation, Hepatic lipid peroxidation was
   significantly correlated with GPx activity (r = -0.47; P < 0.001) in
   CCl4-treated rats. Zinc administration did not produce any significant
   improvement of the hepatic glutathione system,
   4. In conclusion, cirrhosis induction in rats by CCl4 administration
   produced a decrease in the hepatic glutathione antioxidant system that
   was related to an increase in free radical production. Furthermore, zinc
   supplementation produced a reduction in the degree of hepatic injury and
   a normalization of lipid peroxidation, but not an improvement of the
   hepatic GSH anti-oxidant system.}},

Abstract = {{Nova Scotia has struggled with the funding of its universities ever
   since it introduced provincial grants in 1963. This is because some of
   its rather large number of universities and colleges are in very
   different situations as compared with others. How is an equitable
   distribution to be achieved under such circumstances? The longstanding
   solution has been to combine Bred grants based on a historically
   determined base allocation, with a variable component based on
   enrolment. But this grew increasingly problematic as the original
   institutional patterns evolved and, especially, when the province
   adopted a formula of fixed shares combined with actual reductions in
   funding. A new formula was required and this article tells the story of
   its development by the Nova Scotia Council on Higher Education. This
   article explores both the issues that had to be addressed and resolved
   and the institutional dynamics and personalities that shaped their
   resolution. In the end, it became apparent that an equitable
   redistribution of grants to Nova Scotia's universities could be achieved
   through this process only if additional resources were forthcoming.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a powerful and non-invasive technique
   for measuring human brain activity with a high temporal resolution. The
   motivation for studying MEG data analysis is to extract the essential
   features from measured data and represent them corresponding to the
   human brain functions. In this paper a novel MEG data analysis method
   based on independent component analysis (ICA) approach with
   pre-processing: and post-processing multistage procedures is proposed.
   Moreover, several kinds of ICA algorithms are investigated for analyzing
   MEG; tingle-trial data which is recorded in the experiment of phantom.
   The analyzed results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and
   high performance both in source decomposition by IC:A approaches and
   source localization by equivalent current dipoles fitting method.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling ground-penetrating radar (GPR) waves requires simulation of the
   3-D full wavefield and the correct description of the electromagnetic
   (EM) properties. Magnetic and dielectric relaxations are described by
   relaxation functions associated with each principal component of the
   respective tensorial property. Anisotropy is modeled up to orthorhombic
   symmetry, i.e., the principal coordinate systems of the three EM
   material tensors coincide, and each property is described by three
   different principal components.
   The algorithm uses the pseudospectral method for computing the spatial
   derivatives and a second-order finite difference in time. A complete
   plane-wave analysis, including energy balance, gives the expressions of
   measurable quantities such as the EM-wave velocity and the quality
   factor as a function of frequency and propagation direction. The
   algorithm reproduces the wavefront shape and attenuation predicted by
   the plane-wave analysis. In addition, the results are in excellent
   agreement with an analytical 3-D transient solution. The modeling is
   applied to evaluation of the EM response of two pipes buried in an
   anisotropic sand overlying a clay layer. The results demonstrate that
   anisotropy and loss mechanisms cause significant amplitude and phase
   distortions.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Considerable evidence exists that payer status influences
   the type and cost of services provided. If payer status influences care.
   consumers may receive differential care secondary to presence and type
   of payer. This study examines the effect of payer status on certified
   nurse-midwives (CNMs) and obstetricians (OBs), correcting for
   methodologic problems that have been noted in previous studies.
   Methods/findings: Participants were 715 low-risk pregnant women seen in
   the CNM or OB practice in a university hospital service. All billed
   charges from the initial prenatal visit through two months postpartum
   were compared by payer. Charges by provider were also examined to
   determine the presence of differential payer effect. Unexpectedly,
   charges by payer did not show significant variance, nor did payer
   differently affect providers. Charges by provider type varied
   significantly, with CNMs having lower mean charges than OBs.
   Conclusions: Differences in practice by payer source were not found for
   either provider group. This may reflect a lack of financial incentives
   to alter practice based on the payer, the homogeneity of the
   participants, or the large number of payers. The findings indicate that
   provider decision-making styles are likely due to non-payer factors in a
   system that lacks clear incentives to alter care patterns. (C) 2000 by

Abstract = {{Objective: Since excessive fibrinolysis during cardiac surgery is
   frequently associated with abnormal perioperative bleeding, many authors
   have advocated prophylactic use of antifibrinolytic drugs to prevent
   hemorrhagic disorders. We compared the effects of tranexamic acid (a
   synthetic antifibrinolytic drug) with aprotinin (a natural derivative
   product with antifibrinolytic properties) on perioperative bleeding and
   the need for allogeneic transfusions.
   Methods: In a single-center prospective randomized unblinded trial, 1040
   consecutive patients undergoing primary, elective cardiac operations
   with cardiopulmonary bypass received either high-dose aprotinin or
   tranexamic acid. The aprotinin group (518 patients) received 280 mg in
   20 minutes before the skin incision, 280 mg in the priming solution of
   the extracorporeal circuit, and a continuous infusion of 70 mg/h
   throughout the operation. The tranexamic acid group (522 patients)
   received 1 g in 20 minutes before the skin incision, 500 mg in the
   priming solution of the extracorporeal circuit, and a continuous
   infusion of 400 mg/h during the operation. Postoperative bleeding,
   perioperative transfusions, and hematologic variables were evaluated at
   fixed times. Postoperative thrombotic complications. intubation time,
   intensive care unit stay, and hospital stay were recorded.
   Results: Postoperative bleeding was similar in the 2 groups: aprotinin
   250 mt (150-400 mt) versus tranexamic acid 300 mt (200-450 mt) (median
   and 25th-75th quartiles), median difference of 50 mt (95\% confidence
   intervals, 0-50 mt). The number of transfusions and the outcome did not
   differ,
   Conclusions: Tranexamic acid and aprotinin show similar clinical effects
   on bleeding and allogeneic transfusion in patients undergoing primary
   elective heart operations. Since tranexamic acid is about 100 times
   cheaper than aprotinin, its use is preferable in this type of patient.}},

Abstract = {{We present a computer simulator of semiconductor optical amplifiers, The
   nonlinear input-output response of the device is characterized in terms
   of a complex gain, representing the accumulated gain and wavevector
   change of the propagating field across the active waveguide. We account
   for the gain saturation induced by stimulated recombination and by the
   perturbation of the carrier quasi-equilibrium distribution within the
   bands. A rigorous elimination of the spatial coordinate allows us to
   reduce the description of the amplifier dynamics to the solution of a
   set of ordinary differential equation for the complex gain. If the
   waveguide internal loss is negligible, the spatial inhomogeneity of the
   complex gain is implicitly yet exactly taken into account by the reduced
   model. The accuracy of the reduced model is the same for models based on
   the direct solution of the set of partial differential equations
   describing the interaction between the optical held and the active
   semiconductor waveguide, but the model is computationally much simpler.
   To preserve the input-output characteristics of the model, we include
   the amplified spontaneous emission noise in the device description by an
   equivalent signal applied to the device input and amplified by the
   saturated gain. At the expense of a minor increase of the program
   complexity, the waveguide internal loss may also be included. We report
   on the comparison between the output of the simulator and the results of
   four-wave mixing experiments in various pump-signal configurations. Good
   agreement is obtained.}},

   other means. Postmodern war, like all other parts of the Spectacle, can
   no longer be understood as ``politics by other means.{''} Such conflicts
   do make sense, but only at another level of explanation - that of their
   consumption. They stand in a line of development that goes back to the
   earliest dramatic rituals and comes to us through tragedy, opera, film
   and TV drama. Like soap opera, they need no end, for their characters
   are equally plastic and universal. Only for the people whose homes,

   interfaces in turbulence are analyzed and compared. For mixed-fluid

Abstract = {{A 7-year-old girl presented with a history of wine-colored tumoral
   lesions on her leg, right foot, abdomen, and back, present since birth.
   They bled easily on touch or on minimal trauma. Soft, skin-colored
   tumors were also present on the pectoral and left axillary regions. All
   the lesions had increased in size gradually. Also, since birth, she had
   suffered from progressive enlargement of the feet, in the form of edema.
   The edema was soft and cold and did not decrease with rest. Over the
   last 5 years, the feet had been painful while walking. The lesions were
   pruritic on the legs. She had presented with pain, local heat, erythema,
   and an odiferous secretion on the periungual margins of both feet over
   the last year. Her mother reported that the patient presented occasional
   blood streaks in her stools. The patient was born by cesarean section,
   due to polyhydramnios. Her psychomotor development and school life were
   normal, except for a delay in walking (2 years). At the age of 2 years,
   tumors were excised from the right popliteal and axillary regions. She
   received blood transfusions six times, because of a persistent anemia.
   There was no family history of similar tumoral lesions.
   On physical examination at the first evaluation, she had violet-red
   maculae, with scattered small papules inside, located on the abdomen,
   left flank, and right leg (Fig. 1). A 12 x 6 x 4-cm tumor, which was
   soft, mobile, and slightly painful on palpation, was located on the
   right side of the back (Fig. 2). Another verrucous tumor with an
   irregular surface was located on the distal third portion of the left
   leg. Papillomatous and exophytic lesions with an irregular surface were
   found on the left axilla (Fig. 3) and perianal region. There were brown
   plaques with a rough surface distributed in longitudinal bands from the
   left hand, through the left arm to the left anterior-posterior side of
   the trunk, and on the left leg (Fig. 1). A keloid scar was located on
   the right popliteal region. Multiple skin-colored papules with a rough
   surface, were scattered over the thighs. On the fingernails of the left
   hand, the first four fingers had dystrophic nails, inversion of distal
   curvature, longitudinal streaks, and grayish pigmentation. On the feet,
   there was soft, white, cold, and depressible edema, with toes that were
   hypertrophic and increased in length. The first toes had periungual
   swollen and painful margins. Diminished muscular trophism prevailed on
   the arms. She had syndactyly of the second and third toes of the right
   foot, and third and fourth toes of the left foot (Fig. 4). On the
   external genitals, there was a wine-colored exophytic lesion on the
   labia minor. There was dorsal-lumbar scoliosis and varicose veins on the
   right leg.
   The clinical examination did not show any other significant findings.
   The ophthalmologic evaluation and coagulation profile were normal.
   Computerized cerebral tomography showed no pathologic findings.
   Echocardiography was normal. X-Ray of the feet showed a marked increase
   in volume of the soft parts, with elongated deformation of the osseous
   metaphysis and phalanges, and fusion of the third and fourth toes on the
   left foot. X-Ray of the spine showed dorsal-lumbar scoliosis, bifid
   spine on L4-L5 and S1. X-Ray of the skull showed normal sellae.
   Abdominal sonogram showed no alteration. Doppler of the legs showed
   multiple aberrant vessels in areas of angiomas. A sonogram of the right
   dorsal tumor showed multiple cystic formations, some with anecogenic
   contents. A Doppler of these areas showed absence of vascular flow,
   leading to the conclusion of a lymphangioma. Thoraco-abdominal magnetic
   resonance showed thickening of the right posterior-lateral area at the
   expense of subcutaneous cellular tissue. Between the skin and costal
   wall, with a thickness of 2.5 cm and a diameter of approximate to 15 cm,
   this area was composed of multiple cystic structures, suggesting a
   lymphangiolipomatous component. Neither the intraabdominal organs nor
   the retroperitoneal organs were involved. Radionuclear phlebography
   showed a large irregularity in the deep veined system, with the
   prevalence of collaterals and a dilation area on the thigh and left leg;
   on the right lower leg, there was a flow stoppage, with the appearance
   of collateral circulation, probably due to agenesis of the femorals.
   Pulmonary perfusion gammagraphy was normal. The biopsies taken showed
   lymphangioma on the right leg, angiokeratoma on the left axilla, and
   verrucous nevus on the left leg.}},

Abstract = {{We have analysed the expression of cadherin/catenin complex molecules in
   PC C13 rat thyroid cells transformed in vitro with different oncogenes,
   No significant downregulation of either E-cadherin, alpha-, beta- and
   gamma-catenin was detected following the introduction of activated forms
   of myc, adenovirus E1A, ras, raf, myc + ras, EIA + raf, However, ras-
   and raf-transformed PC C13 cells showed altered adherens junctions. An
   altered distribution of cadherin/catenin complexes characterized by
   radially oriented membrane spikes perpendicular to cell edges was the
   most prominent feature evidenced by immunofluorescence. No beta 1
   integrin localization was observed in areas where this altered pattern
   of E-cadherin expression was detected. However, beta 1 integrin submit
   expression was detected at areas of cell-cell contact where E-cadherin
   showed a normal pattern of expression. Furthermore, ras- and
   raf-transformed PC C13 cells showed the ability to migrate in collagen
   gels, in contrast to their normal untransformed counterpart,
   Overexpression of beta 1 integrin was found to restore normal E-cadherin
   localization at cell-cell contacts and to partially inhibit the ability
   to migrate in collagen gels. Finally, two cell lines obtained by ras
   transformation in vivo, and derived from a rat primary thyroid carcinoma
   (TK6) and its lung metastasis (MPTK6), were found to have lost
   gamma-catenin expression. TK6 lost also E-cadherin expression and
   membrane localization of alpha-catenin, These results suggest that: i)
   in vitro thyroid cell transformation is associated to a change in
   cadherin/catenin complexes distribution rather than to a decrease in
   expression; ii) in vivo transformation is associated to the loss of
   expression of some of these molecules likely due to tumor progression;
   iii) alterations in beta 1 integrin subunit expression can result in
   changes in cadherin/catenin function thus implying that an
   integrin-cadherin synergy may exist in thyroid cells.}},

   anastomosis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VASCULAR SURGERY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{524-530}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: We describe a technique for end-to-end sleeve anastomosis that
   may enable minimally invasive bypass grafting and characterize the
   tensile strength, stenosis rate, durability, and healing of the
   anastomosis.
   Method: An anastomotic device assembly consisting of a cable tie-type
   band with mobile teeth elements is mounted on the outer surface of a
   polytetrafluoroethylene graft. The graft is drawn over the artery
   resulting in a sleeve of vessel within the graft. As the band is
   tightened over an intraluminal obturator, the independently mobile
   anchoring teeth are driven through the graft into the artery. The
   tensile strength of the anastomosis was compared with sutured
   anastomosis during in vitro studies using cadaveric human femoral
   arteries. For in vivo studies on pigs and goats, we used a proximal
   exovascular sleeve anastomosis along with a distal sutured aortic
   anastomosis. Survival animals were studied by angiogram postoperatively
   and at the time of explantation.
   Results: In vitro studies showed no difference in maximal tensile
   strength between sutured and exovascular anastomoses (10.5 +/- 2.7 lb vs
   10.2 +/- 3.0 lb, P = .83). However, loss of continuous graft to artery
   interface occurred at lower loads in the sutured anastomoses (6.5 +/-
   0.6 lb, P < .05). In total, all 24 pigs tested in nonsurvival or
   survival settings sustained a successful and leakproof anastomosis. Of
   the 13 nonsurvival cases, maximal epinephrine-induced hypertension
   sustained over 15 minutes (peak systolic blood pressure > 210-250 mm Hg)
   was tolerated without leakage in a subgroup of five animals (100\%). All
   11 survival pigs had no pseudoaneurysms or stenosis relative to sutured
   control anastomoses at 6 week explantation (8.2 +/- 1.25 mm vs 8.5 +/-
   1.6 mm, P = .21). The three long-term survival goats had no
   pseudoaneurysm or stenosis after 40 weeks. Histologic examination
   confirmed healing of the aorta to graft with minimal neointimal
   hyperplasia.
   Conclusion: Exovascular sutureless anastomosis appears comparable to
   sutured anastomosis in stenosis rate, healing, and durability, with some
   advantages in tensile strength and rapidity of application.}},

Abstract = {{A fullerene-cryptand-22-coated piezoelectric (PZ) quartz crystal
   membrane glucose sensor with a homemade computer interface for signal
   acquisition and data processing was prepared. The
   fullerene-cryptand-coated sensor was employed to detect gluconic acid, a
   product of glucose oxidation by glucose oxidase in glucose aqueous
   solutions. The oscillating frequency of the quartz crystal decreased due
   to the adsorption of gluconic acid on fullerene-cryptand-22. The
   low-cost PZ glucose sensor exhibited a linear frequency response to the
   log concentration of glucose with a slope of 1.54 X 10(2) Hz decade(-1)
   (Delta Hz/Delta log M) and a good lower limit of linearity (LLL) of
   approximately 1.0 X 10(-5) M fur glucose in aqueous solutions. The
   interference of various common species in the human blood, e.g. ascorbic
   acid, cystein, galactose, tyrosine, uric acid and the metal ions, to the
   PZ glucose sensor was also investigated. These species showed nearly no
   interference with the PZ glucose sensor. Effects of solvents,
   temperature, coating load, glucose concentration and pH on the frequency
   response of the fullerene-cryptand-22-coated PZ glucose sensor were
   studied and discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a programmable high-performance architecture of
   datapath in the merged DRAM logic (MDL) for video signal processing. A
   model of a datapath in the programmable MDL is generated, and two basic
   parameters, total reguired clock cycles (TRCC) and DRAM access rate
   (DAR), are defined by analysis of the model. Design guidelines are
   suggested for the optimized video signal processor based on the modeling
   and analysis of the MDL, The inverse discrete cosine transform (IDCT)
   and motion compensation (MC) of the video signal processing are analyzed
   in the MDL architecture. Two measures, TRCC and DAR, are determined such
   that the data bandwidth between DRAM and logic is not a bottleneck in
   the MDL architecture. The efficient datapath is designed based on these
   design guidelines. The datapath has processing units (ALU, MAC, and
   Barrel Shifter) with splittabilities of data and multi-port SRAM, The
   maximum performance of the proposed datapath with 200-MHz clock
   frequency is 3.2 GOPS for 8-bit video signals, which can deal with
   decoding high-level (1920 x 1080) in MPEG, The proposed MDL architecture
   has 2.1-4.8 times higher performance compared with conventional
   dedicated hardware chips. It can also be used for other multimedia
   signal processing due to its programmability.}},

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Ultrafine zeolite NaY was hydrothermally crystallized with silica sol
   and Al-2(SO4)(2) as source materials via optimizing synthesis conditions
   and adding light rare earth ions (Ln(3+)) to the synthesis batch. The
   crystallization performance of NaY could be affected by the aging time
   of nucleation Si-Al gel and the crystallization temperature of reaction
   Si-Al gel. With increasing the aging time (2-7 d) of nucleation gel, the
   crystallization rate of zeolite NaY increased whereas the average
   crystal size of zeolite NaY decreased. When elevating the
   crystallization temperature (363-383 K) of reaction gel, both the
   crystallization rate and the average crystal size of zeolite NaY
   increased. Nevertheless, the crystallization performance of zeolite NaY
   was more remarkably affected by the addition of Ln(3+) ions in the
   synthesis batch. The crystallization rate and the n (SiO2)/n(Al2O3)
   ratio obviously increased while the average crystal size greatly reduced
   when zeolite NaY was crystallized in the presence of Ln(3+) ions,
   comparing with that in the absence of Ln(3+) ions, It was found that,
   with the amount of the added Ln(3+) ions increasing, the average crystal
   size of zeolite NaY decreased followed by increasing, while the
   crystallization rate and the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio in framework changed in
   the opposite direction. The optimal amount of Ln(3+) additive appears to
   be in the range of n(Ln(3+)) : n(Al3+) = 0.05 : 1-0.1 : 1 in mole. In
   the case, the as-synthesized NaY zeolites had the smallest average
   crystal sizes (<100 nm), the highest n(SiO2)/n(Al2O3) ratio (>5.7) and
   the shortest crystallization time (<36 h), The role of the added Ln(3+)
   ions was proposed to be that there formed the micro-crystalline
   Ln(OH)(3) under the synthesis conditions, which may present additional
   area to initiate the nucleation of zeolite NaY.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental pollution impacts the ecology of the earth and the quality

   the EPA of any industrial nations announce some regulations of pollution

Abstract = {{AIM: To investigate the effect of protein kinase C (PKC) on the guinea
   pig sperm acrosome reaction (AR) induced by progesterone (P-4) METHODS:
   Guinea pig spermatozoa were preincubated in MCM-Ca2+ DF medium at 38.5
   degrees C under 5 \% CO2/air for 6-6.5 h for capacitation, and were then
   washed through a three-step gradient Percoll, resuspended in MCM-Ca2+ DF
   and adjusted to 5 x 10(9) cells/L. The AR was assessed by means of
   phase-contrast microscopy (expressed as percent of AR) 15 min after
   different reagents were added. RESULTS: In the presence of Ca2+ 2
   mmol/L, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDB) or the permanent synthetic
   diacylglycerol, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG) initiated the AR of
   spermatozoa in a concentration-related manner, whereas staurosporine
   (STA) exhibited an inhibition of the AR. PDB and OAG significantly
   enhanced P-4-induced AR that was greater than that treated with either
   agonist separately. STA markedly inhibited the P-4-induced AR. The AR
   induced by PDS was completely antagonized by inclusion of egtazic acid.
   Also, both egtazic acid and nifedipine antagonized the AR induced by P-4
   and PDB + P-4. In addition, neomycin also prevented the P-4-induced AR.
   This effect could be partly reversed by PDB. CONCLUSION: Activation or
   inhibition of PKC significantly plays an important role in the signal
   transduction pathway for the physiological AR.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we report on a high etch rate GaAs via hole processes
   in an electron cyclotron resonance system using a Cl-2/Ar plasma. The
   effects of process parameters on the GaAs etch rate were investigated.
   The influences of process parameters on the resultant profiles were also
   studied. The GaAs etch rate was found to increase as the Cl-2 percentage
   in the Cl-2/Ar plasma, process pressure, and rf power or the microwave
   power increased. A maximum etch rate of 6.7 mum/min has been obtained
   from a sample etched using a microwave power, rf power, and process
   pressure of 800 W, 150 W, and 50 mTorr, respectively. The degree of
   anisotropy of the etched profile was controlled by varying the process
   pressure and rf power. (C) 2000 American Vacuum Society.

   very difficult to differentiate between two photopolymer replicate seal

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE - A drastic difference is evident in the prevalence of type 2
   diabetes among ethnic groups. We examined the role of beta-cell function
   and insulin sensitivity in this disparity among 4 ethnic groups.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - beta-Cell function and insulin sensitivity
   were assessed in 77 healthy glucose-tolerant subjects using a
   hyperglycemic clamp (18 Asian-Americans, 9 African-Americans, 34
   Caucasians, and 16 Mexican-Americans).
   RESULTS - A wide range of variation was evident in clinical features of
   the studied subjects. Insulin sensitivity index and the second-phase
   insulin response differed among the 4 groups (P = 0.0023 and P = 0.0082,
   respectively), whereas the first-phase insulin response was marginally
   different (P = 0.1090). Stepwise regression analysis revealed that
   ethnicity was an independent determinant for the insulin sensitivity
   index (P = 0.0014) after adjusting for sex, age, diastolic blood
   pressure, waist-to-hip ratio, and BMI. Also, a compensatory response of
   beta-cell function was observed among the ethnic groups.
   CONCLUSIONS - In this study, we observed a drastic difference in insulin
   sensitivity among the different ethnic groups and observed that their
   beta-cell function compensates for the prevailing insulin sensitivity.
   The difference in the prevalence of abnormal glucose tolerance in
   different ethnic groups could be a result of differences in insulin
   sensitivity.}},

   controller consists of the proximate time optimal servomechanisms (PTOS)

   controller, DOB basically provides the chance to apply PTOS to nondouble
   integrator systems by drastically reducing disturbances as well as
   unwanted signals doe to difference between real system and the double
   integrator model. Brit, in DOB-based systems, if control input is
   saturated due to control input of PTOS and/or DOE, overall system
   stability cannot be guaranteed which is first found and analyzed in this
   paper. To solve this problem, robust stability and internal stability
   conditio,as of DOB-based sq:stern ave derived. IE is also shown that DOE
   could violate the internal stability: when the control input is
   saturated Eventually, a simple saturation handling element is inserted
   to maintain internal stability of overall system. Also, ne explain that
   our two saturation handling methods, i.e., Additional Saturation Element
   (ASE) and Self Adjusting, Saturation (SAS) are the equivalent solutions
   of saturation problem to maintain internal stability: The stability and

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an integration approach that extends a global
   operation model with the rules for integration of various information
   systems in an in formation-driven CIM (computer integrated
   manufacturing) environment. A declarative rule language, which follows
   the ECA (event, condition, and action) paradigm, is introduced. The rule
   language allows powerful event specifications and has rich rule
   execution semantics. Hence, active rules satisfying the needs of various
   applications such as business rules, integrity constraint management,
   access control, aler ting and configuration management in a HAD
   (heterogeneous, autonomous and distributed) environment will enable
   integration of applications without semantic loss. A rule management
   system (RMS) architecture that extends the Object Management Group (OMG)
   object model, which is selected as the underlying global operation
   model, with the proposed rule language and a prototype system based on
   the architecture are also described. With the proposed rule language and
   RMS, heterogeneous in formation systems can be integrated along with the
   application knowledge. Further, passive and isolated information systems
   can be changed to active and integrated information systems through the
   reactive behavior of the rules supported by the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Penile fracture is a rare but serious urologic condition that typically
   requires surgical repair. Because of its multiplanar capability and
   excellent tissue contrast, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging can be a
   useful diagnostic tool in the evaluation of patients with acute penile
   fracture. MR imaging can accurately depict the presence, location, and
   extent of tunical tear, which manifests as discontinuity of the tunica
   albuginea. Moreover, because the tunica albuginea is well demonstrated
   as a low-signal-intensity structure on both T1- and T2-weighted images,
   MR imaging is optimal for the evaluation of the integrity of this
   anatomic structure even in patients with severe pain and swelling of the
   penis. This capability makes MR imaging particularly helpful in
   determining the need for surgical intervention, which is largely based
   on the integrity of the tunica albuginea. Associated injuries to
   adjacent structures (eg, corpus spongiosum, urethra) can also be
   demonstrated. In patients with no penile fracture, MR imaging can
   demonstrate an intact tunica albuginea and the presence of
   intracavernosal or extra-tunical hematoma. It remains uncertain whether
   the routine use of contrast material-enhanced MR imaging is justified,
   and further study is needed to determine the role of this modality.}},

Abstract = {{We argue that existing approaches to development, including the women in
   development {[}WID] and gender and development {[}GAD] perspectives,
   fall short in their treatment of culture, and that a new paradigm, which
   we term `Women, Culture and Development' {[}WCD], represents a way
   forward. Linking the fields of feminist studies, cultural studies and
   critical development studies, a WCD framework highlights culture as
   lived experiences and structures of feeling, attends to the relationship
   between production and reproduction in women's lives, and centres
   women's agency and struggles. A multi-ethnic and multiracial feminist
   approach to development studies, and an explicit engagement with culture
   can shift economistic and overly structural analyses to highlight the
   experiences, identities, practices and representations of Third World
   women. We illustrate the potential of a WCD paradigm with discussions of
   the environment and sexuality, and conclude with a sketch of the future
   visions and political possibilities of this approach.}},

   Filipinos' self-concepts, (c) the structure of Filipino traits can be

Abstract = {{The insecticidal activity of 11 extracts from nine South American
   medicinal plants has been studied using the Aedes aegypti larvicidal
   assay. Eight of the 11 plant extracts studied showed toxicity against
   the A. aegypti larvae (LC50 < 500 mu g/ml). The dichloromethane extracts
   of Abuta grandifolia and Minthostachys serosa demonstrated high
   larvicidal activity, the most active being the dichloromethane extract
   of A. grandifolia, with an LC50 = 2.6 mu g/ml (LC100 = 8.1 mu g/ml),
   indicating an activity 2-fold higher than beta-asarone, a natural
   botanical insecticide used as a positive control (LC100 = 16 mu g/ml).
   On the other hand, the dichloromethane extract of M. setosa was quite
   potent against A. aegypti larvae showing an LC50 = 9.2 mu g/ml (LC100 =
   25.2 mu g/ml). The results obtained suggest that the extracts of A.
   grandifolia and M. setosa are promising as larvicides against A. aegypti
   larvae and could be useful in the search for new larvicidal natural
   compounds. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Ultra-lightweight metal foams are an emerging class of new engineering
   materials that can be tailored to have a very attractive combination of
   properties. Aluminum foams produced by Fraunhofer's powder metallurgy
   process show significant promise as multi-functional materials for a
   broad range of transportation applications. Their light weight and very
   high specific stiffness offer significant potential for vehicle weight
   reduction. The high energy absorption capabilities of aluminum foams can
   provide improved crash energy management. The range of materials
   properties that can be achieve using aluminum foams in various
   configurations and in combination with other structural materials are
   reviewed. Current and potential future applications of aluminum foams in
   automobiles, trucks, and military vehicles for weight reduction,
   increased fuel efficiency, and improved mobility are also described.}},

Abstract = {{The equation describing the radial transport of toroidal momentum in a
   collisional subsonic plasma with steep gradients has been obtained via a

   generates, in turn, a toroidal flow gradient, also in Ohmic discharges.
   Moreover, important modifications of the parallel momentum equation are
   found to arise if Lambda(1)equivalent to(nu(i)/Omega(i))(q(2)R(2)/rL(T))
   is greater than or equal to O(1/3); the poloidal rotation velocity is
   then no longer unique but obeys a cubic equation which may allow for
   bifurcated equilibria under certain conditions. The toroidal velocities

Title = {{Regulation of protein kinase C-delta and -epsilon isoforms by phorbol
   ester treatment of LLC-PK1 renal epithelia}},
Journal = {{KIDNEY INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1004-1015}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background. LLC-PK1 renal epithelia are a widely used model for proximal
   tubular physiology and differentiation. Protein kinase C (PKC) has been
   observed to play a role in both processes. This study examines the
   subcellular distribution and down-regulation of PKC-delta and
   PKC-epsilon isoforms in phorbol ester-treated LLC-PK1 epithelia.
   Methods. Cells were treated with 10(-7) mol/L 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol
   13-acetate (TPA) for up to seven days and were extracted as total cell
   lysates as well as cytosolic, membrane-associated (Triton-X soluble) and
   a third (Triton-X insoluble) fraction. The expression and cellular
   localization of PKC-delta and PKC-epsilon isoforms were then detected
   using Western immunoblot and immunofluorescence.
   Results. Based on the use of an anti-PKC-delta monoclonal antibody, TPA
   was observed to cause a rapid decrease in total PKC-delta content, which
   then returned to near control levels by seven days of treatment.
   Immunofluorescence indicated that PKC-delta had a cytoskeletal
   localization within the cells, and a subtle cytoskeletal rearrangement
   occurred upon exposure to TPA. Western immunoblots showed that PKC-delta
   did not undergo the expected membrane translocation upon activation by
   TPA, but simply disappeared immediately from the cytosolic compartment.
   Conventional cell fractionation procedures such as homogenization and
   Triton extraction prior to Western immunoblot will, however, fail to
   evaluate completely PKC-delta in LLC-PK1 epithelia because of the highly
   stringent measures necessary to extract PKC-delta from the cytoskeletal
   compartment of these cells. Furthermore, we observed that a second
   (polyclonal) PKC-delta antibody may recognize phosphorylated forms of
   PKC-delta, which went unrecognized by the other antibody. PKC-epsilon
   was present in the cytosol, membrane, and Triton-X-insoluble fractions
   of the cells. TPA treatment resulted in a partial translocation of
   PKC-epsilon to both the membrane and Triton-X-insoluble fractions of the
   cell, but total PKC-epsilon remained essentially unchanged.
   Conclusions. The present data indicate that the localization of
   PKC-delta and subsequent redistribution within the LLC-PK1 cells in
   response to TPA treatment is highly unique and distinct from that of
   PKC-E and PKC-ol. An important methodological finding is that one given
   antibody may not recognize all phosphoproteins of a given PKC isoform.}},

Abstract = {{Monte Carlo simulation is used to examine the utility of simple
   (homogeneous/isotropic) models for the delineation of wellhead
   protection areas (WHPAs) in heterogeneous, statistically anisotropic,
   unconfined aquifers, Capture zone geometry is investigated under two
   hydrologic conditions: regional gradient negligible compared to pumping
   and significant regional gradient compared to the local gradient due to
   pumping. Variability of capture zone geometry is quantified in terms of
   simple measurements (maximum transport distance and maximum width of the
   capture zone) and the probability of inclusion in the capture zone of a
   series of hypothetical contaminant soul ce locations. These results
   indicate that substantial uncertainty exists in the delineation of a
   wellhead capture zone. This uncertainty is related, principally, to flow
   that occurs along preferential pathways associated with zones of high
   hydraulic conductivity. It is suggested that these uncertainties can be
   accommodated in one of three fashions depending on the value of land,
   the benefit of wellhead protection, and the availability of funds to
   perform more thorough field assessment, The first option is to modify
   the estimated capture zone by a factor of safety. In the absence of
   significant regional flow, a factor of safety of approximately three
   applied to the calculated fixed radius estimate of the capture zone
   appears to be sufficient for the conditions simulated in this project,
   In the case of a capture zone within a significant regional gradient,
   uncertainty in the location of the real capture zone will require safety
   factors on the width of the estimated capture zone on the order of 30,
   with a safety factor of approximately three in the longitudinal
   direction. The second option reduces these factors of safety by
   increasing the risk that the estimated capture zone will not cover the
   entire area of the real capture zone. work available in the literature
   prow-ides insight into the trade-off between the size of the estimated
   capture zone and the risk endured. The third option is to reduce
   uncertainty in the vicinity of a wellhead through additional expenditure
   to allow the application of classic hydrologic techniques involving
   conditioning or inverse modeling.}},

Abstract = {{The 1'-hydroxylation of rac-bufuralol, which is catalyzed by polymorphic
   CYP2D6 in humans, was studied in brain microsomes from male and female
   Wistar rats and from the female Dark Agouti rat, a model of the CYP2D6
   poor metabolizer phenotype. The kinetics of the 1'-hydroxylation of
   bufuralol (1-1500 mu M) by brain microsomes were biphasic. The activity
   of the high-affinity site of metabolism was consistent with
   Michaelis-Menten kinetics (apparent K-m1 = 0.61-1.42 mu M, V-max1 =
   4.3-4.8 fmol/min/mg of protein), whereas the low-affinity activity was
   better described by a Hill function (K-50\%(2) = 253-258 mu M, V-max2 =
   817-843 fmol/min/mg of protein, n = 1.2-1.3). Values for kinetic
   constants were similar in all rat strains. Quinine was only a weak
   inhibitor of both the high- (apparent K-i = 90 mu M) and low-affinity
   (210 mu M) sites of metabolism. In contrast, the kinetics of
   1'-hydroxylation of bufuralol by rat liver microsomes were best
   described by a two-site Michaelis-Menten function. V-max values were 3
   to 5 orders of magnitude greater compared with those for brain
   microsomes (male and female Wistar), and liver microsomes from female
   Dark Agouti rats were significantly less active than those from Wistar
   rats. These data, together with the known potent inhibitory effect of
   quinine on bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation by rat liver microsomes, indicate
   tissue-specific differences in the enzymology of this reaction. The role
   of brain CYP2D enzymes remains to be clarified.}},

Abstract = {{The Sustainable Agriculture Farming Systems (SAFS) Project has studied
   the transition to low-input and organic alternatives in California's
   Sacramento Valley. This project compares a 4-5 yr rotation of tomato
   (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.), safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.),
   corn (Zea mays L.), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L,) followed by
   double-dropped bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L,) in the conventional system
   and oat (Avena sativa L.)-purple vetch (Vicia benghalensis L.) in the
   low-input and organic systems. A conventional 2-yr rotation
   (tomato-wheat) is also studied. In 1997 and 1998, we evaluated the
   transition to alternative systems on soil bulk density, water holding
   capacity, infiltration and storage, water use efficiency, and `Brigade'
   tomato yield and quality. No differences in laboratory determinations of
   soil bulk density and water holding capacity were found; however, in
   situ water holding capacity was highest in the organic system, lowest in
   the conventional 4-yr rotation and intermediate in the low-input and
   conventional 2-yr rotations. In 1998, infiltration during 3-h
   irrigations was 0.028 m(3) m(-1) for the conventional, and 0.062 m(3)
   m(-1) and 0.065 m(3) m(-1) for the low-input and organic systems,
   respectively. Similar results were observed in 1997, The alternative
   systems required more water per irrigation for uniform application,
   resulting in higher soil water content in the organic systems throughout
   1998, Evapotranspiration was higher in the conventional systems in both
   years relative to other systems. Tomato yields did not differ among
   systems in either year. Fruit quality was highest in the conventional
   4-yr system.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{194-204}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Secondary structure is evaluated for determining evolutionary
   relationships between catalytic RNA molecules that are so distantly
   related they are scarcely alignable. The ribonucleoproteins RNase P (P)
   and RNase MRP (MRP) have been suggested to be evolutionarily related
   because of similarities in both function and secondary structure.
   However, their RNA sequences cannot be aligned with any confidence, and
   this leads to uncertainty in any trees inferred from sequences. We
   report several approaches to using secondary structures for inferring
   evolutionary trees and emphasize quantitative tests to demonstrate that
   evolutionary information can be recovered. For P and MRP, three
   hypotheses for the relatedness are considered. The first is that MRP is
   derived from P in early eukaryotes. The next is that MRP is derived from
   P from an early endosymbiont. The third is that both P and MRP evolved
   in the RNA-world (and the need for MRP has since been lost in
   prokaryotes). Quantitative comparisons of the pRNA and mrpRNA secondary
   structures have found that the possibility of an organellar origin of
   MRP is unlikely. In addition, comparison of secondary structures support
   the identity of an RNase P-like sequence in the maize chloroplast
   genome. Overall, it is concluded that RNA secondary structure is useful
   for evaluating evolutionary relatedness, even with sequences that cannot
   be aligned with confidence.}},

Abstract = {{Allopolyploid hybridization serves as a major pathway for plant
   evolution, but in its early stages it is associated with phenotypic and
   genomic instabilities that are poorly understood. We have investigated
   allopolyploidization between Arabidopsis thaliana (2n = 2x = 10; n,
   gametic chromosome number; x, haploid chromosome number) and
   Cardaminopsis arenosa (2n = 4x = 32). The variable phenotype of the
   allotetraploids could not be explained by cytological abnormalities.
   However, we found suppression of 20 of the 700 genes examined by
   amplified fragment length polymorphism of cDNA. Independent reverse
   transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses of 10 of these 20 genes
   confirmed silencing in three of them, suggesting that similar to 0.4\%
   of the genes in the allotetraploids are silenced. These three silenced
   genes were characterized. One, called K7, is repeated and similar to
   transposons. Another is RAP2.1, a member of the large APETALA2 (AP2)
   gene family, and has a repeated element upstream of its 5' end. The
   last, L6, is an unknown gene close to ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE on
   chromosome 1. CNG DNA methylation of K7 was less in the allotetraploids
   than in the parents, and the element varied in copy number. That K7
   could be reactivated suggests epigenetic regulation. L6 was methylated
   in the C. arenosa genome. The present evidence that gene silencing
   accompanies allopolyploidization opens new avenues to this area of
   research.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Aims: Although coeliac disease is a common condition, the
   role of population screening is not clear. The aim of this study was to
   determine the prevalence and clinical significance of coeliac disease in
   the adult population of Christchurch, New Zealand.
   Methods: A total of 1064 adults randomly selected from the 1996
   Christchurch electoral rolls were enlisted. The subjects were screened
   for coeliac disease using the anti-endomysial antibody test (EMA), and
   all those with positive tests were reviewed and underwent a small bowel
   biopsy.
   Results: Twelve of the 1064 persons tested (1.1\%) were EMA positive and
   all had small bowel biopsy histology consistent with coeliac disease.
   Two of the 12 subjects were previously known to be EMA positive although
   neither had a small bowel biopsy. One additional subject with known and
   treated coeliac disease was also enrolled but was EMA negative. Thus,
   the overall prevalence of coeliac disease was 13 of 1064 subjects
   (1.2\%, or 1 : 82), 10 of whom were newly diagnosed (0.9\%, or 1 : 106)
   and three were previously known or suspected to have coeliac disease
   (0.3\%, or 1 : 355). The prevalence in both sexes was similar. Nine of
   the 12 EMA-positive coeliac disease subjects identified by the use of
   screening reported symptoms, of which tiredness and lethargy were the
   most common. The subjects were of normal stature, although females
   tended to be lean. None of the subjects were anaemic, but four were iron
   deficient and four folate deficient. Five of the 12 had sustained bone
   fractures. Bone mineral density was reduced in males but not in females.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of coeliac disease in the adult population
   of Christchurch, New Zealand, is 1.2\%. Unrecognized coeliac disease
   which was detected by population screening was three-fold more common
   than proven or suspected coeliac disease. Population screening may
   identify subjects who could benefit from treatment. (C) 2000 Blackwell

Abstract = {{Mapping and U-Pb geochronology have been used to examine the tectonic
   and depositional history of the Archean Island Lake greenstone belt in
   the northwestern Superior Province. The Island Lake greenstone belt
   comprises two main supracrustal successions, the older Hayes River Group
   and the younger Island Lake Group. Zircon data for two volcanic units
   from the Hayes River Group provide identical ages of 2852 +/- 1.5 Ma,
   whereas a turbidite of this group contains a detrital zircon population
   with ages between 2858 and 2847 Ma. Younger intrusive events include the
   emplacement of tonalite in the southern batholith at 2825 +/- 2 Ma and
   the Whiteway Island gabbro at 2807 +/- 1 Ma. A wacke at the base of the
   Island Lake Group is dominated by detrital zircon grains yielding ages
   between 2830 and 2821 Ma, the latter defining a maximum age of
   sedimentation. A relatively early time of deposition of the lower
   stratigraphic sections of the Island Lake Group is also supported by an
   age of 2744 +/- 2 Ma obtained for a crosscutting tonalite. By contrast,
   two turbidite horizons from higher stratigraphic levels of the Island
   Lake Group contain detrital zircon populations with ages mostly younger
   than 2730 Ma, the youngest zircon grains providing maximum ages of
   sedimentation at 2722 and 2712 Ma, respectively. Our results confirm the
   protracted evolution of the greenstone belt and show in particular that
   major sedimentary processes were active throughout the main stages of
   volcanism of the belt. This pattern of protracted sedimentation is
   comparable to that observed in other greenstone belts of the
   northwestern Superior Province, all of which developed on pre-Kenoran
   crust.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Recombinant human interferon alpha (rhIFN-alpha) is used
   therapeutically in malignant disorders and chronic hepatitis. The
   present study was assessed to study the effects of rhIFN-alpha on the
   hypo thalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) axis.
   Design and methods: We performed a saline-controlled cross-over study in
   six healthy men, sequentially measuring the serum concentrations of
   gonadotropins, testosterone, the free androgen index (FAI) and sex
   hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) after a bolus subcutaneous injection of
   rhIFN-alpha.
   Results: rhIFN-alpha induced a sustained decrease of both testosterone
   (from 19.5 +/- 1.88 to a nadir of 5.49 +/- 0.51 nmol/l at the end of the
   study) and FAI (from 98.7 +/- 14.7 to a nadir of 32.1 +/- 5.3 at the end
   of the study), whereas concentrations of LH, FSH and SHBG were not
   different between the two studies.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that rhlFN-alpha affects the HPT axis
   at the testicular level, either directly or indirectly and changes
   feedback relationships between the pituitary and the testis.}},

Title = {{Identification and spread of Fomitiporia punctata associated with wood

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{90}},

Abstract = {{A full understanding of the pathology of esca, a chronic disease of
   grapevines, has been problematic, in part because the identity of the
   pathogen (or pathogens) has been difficult to determine. The wood decay
   symptoms of esca have been most often associated with Phellinus
   igniarius or Fomitiporia punctata. However, Koch's postulates have not
   been completely fulfilled because symptoms take many years to develop.
   The goal of this study was to determine the identity and mode of spread
   of basidiomycetes associated with wood decay in vines showing esca
   symptoms in Italian vineyards. Vineyards were intensively studied for
   the presence of basidiocarps, and mycelium was isolated from symptomatic
   vines. Fruiting bodies were identified by morphology, while mycelial
   isolates were identified by restriction fragment length polymorphism
   analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region of the nuclear
   ribosomal RNA gene cluster. Fomitiporia punctata fruiting bodies and
   mycelium were associated with approximately 50\% of the vines showing
   esca symptoms in two vineyards; P. igniarius was not found in any
   samples. Fruiting bodies of F. punctata were found in five of six
   vineyards examined, but at low frequencies except in one vineyard. The
   diversity of somatic incompatibility types was very high; isolates from
   almost every vine had different somatic incompatibility types. With few
   exceptions, symptomatic and dead vines were not spatially aggregated
   within 12 vineyards. The combination of diverse somatic incompatibility
   types and lack of spatial aggregations are not consistent with the
   hypothesis that the disease is spread clonally through roots or by
   pruning tools. The correct identity of basidiomycetes associated with
   wood decay of vines with esca symptoms is important for understanding
   the epidemiology of this disease because F. punctata is found commonly
   on many woody hosts in Europe, which may represent a potential inoculum
   source for this disease.}},

Abstract = {{A paraHox gene cluster has been described recently in Amphioxus. We show

   of the duplication of an ancestral paraHox gene cluster, human paraHOX
   genes are located in four paralogous regions of the genome, on
   chromosomes 4, 5, 13 and X. By analogy with the four HOX gene clusters,
   we propose to designate the four paraHOX gene clusters as paraHOX-A to D
   clusters. We also propose a scenario for the evolution of HOX and
   paraHOX genes. Several chromosomal translocation breakpoints of
   hemopathies are located in the paralogous regions that contain the
   paraHOX genes. Two of the paraHOX genes are involved in these
   rearrangements.}},

Abstract = {{Abl-interactor (Abi) proteins are targets of Abl-family nonreceptor
   tyrosine kinases and are required for Rac-dependent cytoskeletal
   reorganization in response to growth factor stimulation. We asked if the
   expression, phosphorylation, and cellular localization of Abi-1 and
   Abi-2 supports a role for these proteins in Abl signaling in the
   developing and adult mouse nervous system. In mid- to late-gestation
   embryos, abi-2 message is elevated in the central and peripheral nervous
   systems (CNS and PNS). Abi-1 mRNA is present, but not enhanced, in the
   CNS, and is not observed in PNS structures. Abi proteins from brain
   lysates undergo changes in apparent molecular weight and phosphorylation
   with increasing age. In the postnatal brain, abi-1 and abi-2 are
   expressed most prominently in cortical layers populated by projection
   neurons. In cultured neurons, Abi-1 and Abi-2 are concentrated in puncta
   throughout the cell body and processes. Both Abi and Abl proteins are
   present in synaptosomes and growth cone particles. Therefore, the Abi
   adaptors exhibit proper expression patterns and subcellular localization
   to participate in Abl kinase signaling in the nervous system.}},

Abstract = {{Human CD83 is a cell surface protein expressed predominantly by
   dendritic cells (DC) and lymphoid cells. So far, there exists no
   information on the function and distribution of mCD83, Here we
   demonstrate that mCD83 is moderately expressed on resting T cells and
   DC, but strongly increases In its expression on T cells following
   activation with antigenic peptides or T cell receptor-specific mAb. When
   returning to the resting state, T cells down-regulate CD83 again. Ig
   fusion proteins which express the extracellular part of the mCD83
   molecule (mCD83-Ig) specifically inhibit antigen-specific T cell
   proliferation and IL-2 secretion in spleen cell cultures from DO11.10 T
   cell receptor transgenic mice. Staining of spleen cells from BALB/c, XID
   and mu MT (B cell) knockout mice with mCD83-Ig proteins reveals the
   presence of a CD83 ligand predominantly expressed most likely by B220(+)
   cells since spleen cells from mu MT knockout mice do not bind mCD83-Ig,
   CD83, besides its established expression on human dendritic cells, thus,
   also represents a new marker molecule on activated T cells which with
   its specific ligand is involved in the regulation of T cell responses.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated the nonlinear properties of the electromagnetic
   ion/ion cyclotron instability (EMIIC) by means of hybrid simulations
   (macroparticle ions, massless electron fluid). The instability is driven
   by the relative (super Alfvenic) streaming of two field-aligned ion
   beams in a low beta plasma (ion thermal pressure to magnetic field
   pressure) and may be of importance in the plasma sheet boundary layer.
   As shown in previously reported simulations the waves propagate
   obliquely to the magnetic field and heat the ions in the perpendicular
   direction as the relative beam velocity decreases. By running the
   simulation to large times it can be shown that the large temperature
   anisotropy leads to the ion cyclotron instability (IC) with parallel
   propagating Alfven ion cyclotron waves. This is confirmed by numerically
   solving the electromagnetic dispersion relation. An application of this
   property to the plasma sheet boundary layer is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Acetylcholine is important to hippocampal function,
   including the processes of learning and memory. Patients with
   schizophrenia show impaired learning and memory and hippocampal
   dysfunction. Thus, acetylcholinergic systems may be primarily or
   secondarily disrupted in the hippocampal formation of schizophrenic
   patients, The present study tested the hypothesis that
   {[}H-3]pirenzepine-labeled muscarinic cholinergic receptor levels are
   altered in the hippocampal formation of patients with schizophrenia,
   Methods: We have used quantitative autoradiography to measure
   {[}H-3]pirenzepine binding to M-1 and M-4 receptors in the hippocampal
   formation from 15 schizophrenic and IS nonschizophrenic subjects.
   Results: The mean density of {[}H-3]pirenzepine binding was reduced in
   all regions studied including the dentate gyrus, subdivisions of Ammon's
   Horn (CA1-CA4), subiculum, and the parahippocampal gyrus, of the
   schizophrenic cohort. Moreover, unlike controls, there was no
   significant variation between the mean levels of {[}H-3]pirenzepine
   binding across the subregions of the hippocampal formation from
   schizophrenic subjects,
   Conclusions: These findings provide support for a possible involvement
   of the muscarinic cholinergic system in the pathology and/or treatment
   of schizophrenia. (C) 2000 Society of Biological Psychiatry.}},

Abstract = {{The side chain of the antifungal antibiotic ansatrienin A from
   Streptomyces collinus contains a cyclohexanecarboxylic acid
   (CHC)-derived moiety. This moiety is also observed in trace amounts of
   omega-cyclohexyl fatty acids (typically less than 1\% of total fatty
   acids) produced by S. collinus. Coenzyme A-activated CHC (CHC-CoA) is
   derived from shikimic acid through a reductive pathway involving a
   minimum of nine catalytic steps. Five putative CHC-CoA biosynthetic
   genes in the ansatrienin biosynthetic gene cluster of S. collinus have
   been identified. Plasmid-based heterologous expression of these five
   genes in Streptomyces avermitilis or Streptomyces lividans allows for
   production of significant amounts of omega-cyclohexyl fatty acids (as
   high as 49\% of total fatty acids). In the absence of the plasmid these
   organisms are dependent on exogenously supplied CHC for omega-cyclohexyl
   fatty acid production. Doramectin is a commercial antiparasitic
   avermectin analog produced by fermenting a bkd mutant of S. avermitilis
   in the presence of CHC. introduction of the S. collinus CHC-CoA
   biosynthetic gene cassette into this organism resulted in an engineered
   strain able to produce doramectin without CHC supplementation. The
   CHC-CoA biosynthetic gene cluster represents an important genetic tool
   for precursor-directed biosynthesis of doramectin and has potential for
   directed biosynthesis in other important polyketide-producing organisms.}},

Abstract = {{Adrenergic and cholinergic tone on the cardiovascular system of
   embryonic chickens was determined during days 12, 15, 19, 20, and 21 of

   mg/kg) resulted in no significant change in heart rate or arterial
   pressure at any developmental age. In addition, the general
   cardiovascular depressive effects of hypoxia were unaltered by
   pretreatment with atropine. In addition, the ganglionic blocking agent
   hexamethonium (25 mg/kg) did not induce changes in heart rate. The
   beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (3 mg/kg) induced a bradycardia
   of similar magnitude on all days studied, with a transient hypertensive
   action on days 19-20, indicating the existence of an important cardiac
   and vascular beta-adrenergic tone. Injections of the alpha-adrenergic
   antagonists prazosin or phentolamine (1 mg/kg) reduced arterial pressure

Abstract = {{Belanolaimus longicaudatus has been reported as damaging both potato

   infested with B. longicaudatus. During the 1990s cotton was grown in a
   potato production region that was a suitable habitat for B,
   longicaudatus. It was not known how integrating the production of these
   two crops by rotation or double-cropping would affect the population
   densities of B. longicaudatus, other plant-parasitic nematodes common in
   the region, or crop yields. A 3-year field study evaluated the viability
   of both crops in monocropping, rotation, and double-cropping systems.
   Viability was evaluated using effects on population densities of
   plant-parasitic nematodes and yields. Rotation of cotton with potato was
   found to decrease population densities of B. longicaudatus and
   Meloidogyne incognita in comparison with continuous potato. Population
   densities of B. longicaudatus following double-cropping were greater

Abstract = {{By considering arbitrary source-receiver configurations, compressional
   primary reflections can be imaged into time or depth-migrated seismic
   sections so that the migrated wavefield amplitudes are a measure of
   angle-dependent reflection coefficients. Several migration algorithms
   were proposed in the recent past based on the Born or Kirchhoff
   approach. All of them are given in form of a weighted diffraction-stack
   integral operator that is applied to the input seismic data. The result
   is a migrated seismic section where at each reflection point the source
   wavelet is reconstructed with an amplitude proportional to the
   reflection coefficient at that point. Based on the Kirchhoff approach,
   we derive the weight function and the diffraction stack integral
   operator for a two and one-half (2.5-D) seismic model and apply it to a
   set of synthetic seismic data in noisy environment. The result shows the
   accuracy and stability of the 2.5-D migration method as a tool for
   obtaining important information about the reflectivity properties of the
   earth's subsurface, which is of great interest for amplitude vs. offset
   (angle) analysis. We also present a new application of the Double
   Diffraction Stack (DDS) inversion method to determine three important
   parameters along the normal ray path, i.e., the angle and point of
   emergence at the earth surface, and also the radius of curvature of the

Abstract = {{Time-resolved reflectance and transmittance spectroscopy was applied to
   measure in vivo the absorption and transport scattering spectra of the
   female breast from 610 to 1010 nm, Three measurement configurations were
   used to probe different breast regions, and data were collected two or
   three times in each of the five phases of the menstrual cycle, The
   absorption spectra were best-fitted with a linear combination of the
   spectra of the main tissue constituents (water, lipids, oxy- and
   deoxyhemoglobin), This allowed us to evaluate percentage contents of
   water and lipids, total hemoglobin content and hemoglobin oxygen
   saturation. The scattering spectra were interpreted with a function
   derived from Mie theory, providing information on the density and
   average size of the tissue scatterers. Significant changes in the
   estimated variables were observed with measurement geometry, reflecting
   the heterogeneous nature of the breast, and with time, in agreement with
   expected physiological changes over the menstrual cycle.}},

Abstract = {{The material and electrical characteristics of YBa2Cu3O7 (YBCO) thin
   Rims deposited by inverted cylindrical magnetron sputtering on (110)
   SrTiO3 (STO) were investigated. X-ray diffractometry shows the grain
   orientations to be predominantly the YBCO (110) and (103) with no
   evidence of c-axis grains. Electron micrographs show the film surface to
   consist of coupled elongated grains parallel to the (110) STO edge. The
   films were patterned into small 2.5 mm squares parallel to the substrate
   edges for electrical characterization. Transport currents parallel and
   perpendicular to the (110) substrate edge showed a 945:1 anisotropy in
   film resistance and a factor of two in critical current density for
   temperatures below 60\% of the transition temperature (T-c), The
   temperature dependence of the critical current near T-c was
   quadratic-like and strongly dependent on the value of T-c used in the
   analysis. For the two orientations, there was nearly a 6K difference in
   T-c as determined by the point at which the critical current became
   zero. The response of the critical current to small magnetic fields was
   greater for transport current along the c-axis direction and was
   observable over a temperature interval nearly four times greater than
   for current along the basal plain. These YBCO thin films have good
   response to small magnetic fields and are suitable for vortex flow
   device development. Index Terms-High-temperature superconductors,

Abstract = {{Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos, and Dvali have proposed that the fundamental
   gravitational scale is close to 1 TeV, and that the observed weakness of
   gravity at long distances is explained by the presence of large extra
   compact dimensions. If this scenario is realized in a string theory of
   quantum gravity, the string excited states of standard model particles
   will also have TeV masses. These states will be visible to experiment
   and in fact provide the first signatures of the presence of a low

   signatures due to real and virtual graviton emission. We study the
   effects of these states in a simple string model.}},

Abstract = {{Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based vectors are being tested in animal
   models as viable treatments for glioma and neurodegenerative disease and
   could potentially be employed to target a variety of central nervous
   system disorders. The relationship between dose of injected vector and
   its resulting distribution in brain tissue has not been previously
   reported nor has the most efficient method of delivery been determined.
   Hen we report that convection-enhanced delivery (CED) of 2.5 x 10(8),
   2.5 x 10(9), or 2.5 x 10(10) particles of AAV-thymidine kinase (AAV-TK)
   into rat brain revealed a clear dose response. In the high-dose group, a
   volume of 300 mm(3) of brain tissue was partially transduced. Results
   showed that infusion pump and subcutaneous osmotic pumps were both
   capable of delivering vector via CED and that total particle number was
   the most important determining factor in obtaining efficient expression.
   Results further showed differences in histopathology between the
   delivery groups. While administration of vector using. infusion pump had
   relatively benign effects, the use of osmotic pumps resulted in notable
   toxicity to the surrounding brain tissue. To determine tissue
   distribution of vector following intracranial delivery, PCR analysis was
   performed on tissues from rats that received high doses of AAV-TK. three
   weeks following CED, vector could be detected in both hemispheres of the
   brain, spinal cord, spleen, and kidney.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a model of the accretion flow onto a black hole consisting of
   the accretion disk with an accreting two-temperature corona. The model
   is based on assumptions about the radiative and conductive energy
   exchange between the two phases and the pressure equilibrium. The
   complete model is determined by the mass, the accretion rate, and the
   viscosity parameter. We present the radial dependencies of parameters of
   such a two-phase flow, with advection in the corona and the disk/corona
   mass exchange due to evaporation/condensation included, and we determine
   the transition radius from a two-phase disk/corona accretion to a
   single-phase optically thin flow (ADAF) in the innermost part of the
   disk as a function of accretion rate. We identify the NLS1 galaxies with
   objects accreting at a rate close to the Eddington accretion rate. The
   strong variability of these objects may be related to the limit cycle
   behaviour expected in this luminosity range, as the disk, unstable due
   to the dominance by the radiation pressure, oscillates between the two
   stable branches: the advection-dominated optically thick branch and the
   evaporation branch. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A simple measuring method for impact tensile strength of brittle
   materials is presented and discussed. It is based on the superposition
   and concentration of tensile stress waves reflected both from the free
   ends of a striking bar and a specimen bar. The experiment is conducted
   by means of a Hopkinson bar technique using an air-gun arrangement. The
   impact tensile experiment of concrete and mortar specimen bars was
   performed as well as static strength tests of splitting tension,
   bending, and compression. The experimental data in relation to those
   strengths were analyzed statistically by means of a Weibull
   distribution. The impact tensile strengths were significantly influenced
   by loading rates, and they were found to be from 1.5 to 2 times of the
   static values. For examining the adequacy and limit of the present
   measuring method, numerical simulations on the stress waves propagated
   in the specimen bars were carried out under the condition of
   two-dimensional axisymmetric model using the FEM code and some
   reasonable results were found.}},

Abstract = {{The historical emergence of a field devoted to the experimental
   investigation of effects identified as ``social{''} required a radical
   break with traditional conceptions of the social. Psychological
   experimentation was limited to the investigation of effects that were
   proximal, local, short-term, and decomposable. A viable accommodation to
   these constraints occurred in the closely related programs of Moede's
   experimental crowd psychology and Floyd Allport's experimental social
   psychology. Later, Kurt Lewin attempted to provide a different
   conceptual foundation for the field by drawing on certain precepts of
   Gestalt psychology and the philosophy of scientific experimentation
   developed by Ernst Cassirer. These ideas were poorly understood and were
   soon replaced by a methodological regime in which a new generation of
   statistical procedures and experimental design shaped implicit
   conceptions of the social in social psychological experiments through
   such procedures as randomization and the additive combination of
   variables. (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) in groundnut meal (GNM) was detoxified up to 97\%
   by a combination of enzymatic and physical processes. Finely-powdered
   defatted groundnut meal containing 1.2 mM AFB(1) per 100 g of meal was
   first detoxified up to 53\% with 10 IU of horseradish peroxidase enzyme
   in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and then the meal containing
   12-15\% (wb) moisture was treated with microwave radiation at 1 kwt for
   15 min to achieve a final 97\% detoxification. A comparison was made of
   the treated and untreated groundnut meal quality with respect to their
   nitrogen solubility, total nitrogen and protein nitrogen contents, and
   protein composition. Rat feeding experiments were performed to study the
   effect of detoxification processes on ground nut meal quality as
   indicated by the mortality, food efficiency ratio and food conversion
   rate. Mean weight gains of the rats receiving the treated meals were
   essentially comparable to those for animals receiving aflatoxin-free
   diets. Overall, nitrogen-solubility of the enzyme-treated meal increases
   in the pH 2-6 range. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic patterns of the
   protein did not show any notable changes. Amount of protein nitrogen in
   the meal increased after the enzymatic treatment. Mortality rates of the
   young animals were high when they were fed untreated meal containing
   aflatoxin. Resistance increased with age, which was evidenced by the
   relatively lower mortality rate of the rats after prolonged feeding of
   aflatoxin-infected meal. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The Tax protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-I) enhances
   viral gene expression through sequences in the U3 region of the viral
   long terminal repeat. These sequences consist of three imperfect 21-bp
   repeats (TRE-1s) and a region between the promoter-central and
   promoter-proximal 21-bp repeats (TRE-2). The TRE-1s contain a core
   cyclic AMP response element (CRE) motif and can be bound by CREB, ATF-1,
   ATF-2, and other members of the CREB-ATF superfamily of transcription
   factors. Tax enhances CREB binding to TRE-1 in vitro, and it promotes
   dimerization of CREB as well as other bZIP proteins. Using
   ligation-mediated PCR on in vivo dimethyl sulfate-treated
   HTLV-1-infected cell lines MT-2 and MT-4, we have compiled a profile of
   protein occupancy in the HTLV-1 enhancer sequences in the presence of
   high (MT-2) and low (MT-4) levels of biologically active Tax I. The in
   vivo footprinting showed that all three TRE-1s were bound by protein(s),
   but only in MT-2 cells. In MT-2 cells, all TRE-1s showed strong
   protection of the G residues in the central CRE, and the footprints
   extended to differing degrees into the GC-rich flanking sequences. This
   indicated Tax I-dependent loading of transcription factors onto the
   HTLV-1 TRE-1s in vivo. In vivo footprinting on TRE-2 indicated that this
   region was bound by proteins regardless of the Tax I status of the cell
   line. However, the presence of Tax I increased the extent and altered
   the profile of proteins binding TRE-2 in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Intertidal organisms are influenced by the tidal, daily, and seasonal
   environmental variability of their habitat. interannual variability,
   although often less severe than shorter-scale variability, may also be
   important in structuring intertidal systems. This study compares the
   magnitude of changes in a rocky intertidal fish guild occurring on a
   seasonal scale with those occurring during an El Nino Southern
   oscillation (ENSO). I examined tidepool fish assemblage structure and
   habitat use in two southern California sites approximately every 3
   months from 1996 to 2000, a period including non-ENSO conditions, the
   1997-1998 El Nino, and the 1998-1999 La Nina. During each sampling
   period, I censused fish abundance in 105 tidepools of differing
   intertidal height, depth, and surface area. Several aspects of habitat
   use varied seasonally for the four most common species: Clinocottus
   analis (woolly sculpin), Girella nigricans (opaleye), Gobiesox rhessodon
   (California clingfish), and Hypsoblennius gilberti (notch-brow blenny).
   All four species migrated vertically within the intertidal zone on a
   seasonal scale, corresponding to seasonal changes in sea level. The
   assemblage dominant, C. analis, occupied tidepools of different sizes
   depending on season. Although seasonality in habitat use suggests an
   influence of environmental variability on seasonal scales, fish habitat
   was generally not altered by temperature and sea level changes imposed
   by the El Nino. Species assemblage, however, differed among climate
   conditions. C. analis declined in abundance during the El Nino because
   of lack of recruitment but increased immediately after its conclusion.
   Paraclinus integripinnis (reef finspot), usually rare, was more abundant
   during the El Nino. Effect of the El Nino on the other four species was
   not detected. Assemblage changes suggest that although intertidal fishes
   regularly experience large tidal, daily, and seasonal environmental
   fluctuations, interannual changes in environmental factors, even when
   relatively small in magnitude, can perturb the system. Perturbations in
   the present system, however, did not persist beyond the end of the El
   Nino event as they often do in lower-latitude nearshore areas.}},

Abstract = {{The classical one-dimensional advection-diffusion equation (ADE) gives
   an inadequate description of tracer cloud evolution in the River Severn,
   U.K. A solute transport model incorporating the effects of tracer
   storage in dead zones is presented in which the channel is conceived as
   being divided into two parallel regions. The bulk flow region occurs in
   the central part. Its longitudinal dispersive properties are described
   by the ADE. Adjacent to this, an additional cross-sectional area is
   defined in which tracer can be stored temporarily in regions of slowly
   moving water called dead zones. Exchange between the two regions follows
   a first order rate equation. Applying the model to the River Severn
   shows that a dispersing cloud's evolution occurs in two distinct stags
   with a rapid transitional phase. Initially, shear-dispersion is dominant
   while the tracer particles mix fully over the bulk flow. Once this has
   occurred, dead zone storage accounts well for the non-Fickian evolution
   of the cloud. After the transitional phase the dead zone storage
   mechanism clearly dominates over shear-dispersion. Overall, the combined
   shear flow dispersion-dead zone model (D-DZM) provides a much better,
   physically consistent description of the tracer cloud's evolution than
   the simple classical ADE approach can do alone.}},

Abstract = {{This study tests several tenets of Wells' meta-cognitive theory of
   Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) by using the Meta-Cognitions
   Questionnaire (MCQ), which was designed to measure meta-cognition in
   GAD, The MCQ Cognitive Confidence subscale (MC-CC) predicted anxiety
   symptoms even after controlling for both trait anxiety and trait worry.
   In addition, the MCQ Uncontrollability and Danger (MCQ-UD) subscale had
   the highest correlation with a discriminant function that correctly
   classified 80.6\% of nonanxious, nonworried-anxious, and GAD
   participants. Finally, participants who met GAD criteria exhibited
   significantly higher levels of meta-worry than nonanxious and
   nonworried-anxious participants, and exhibited both positive and
   negative beliefs about worry. These results offer additional support for
   Wells' meta-cognitive theory of GAD, but also highlight some of its
   limitations with respect to predictive validity. (C) 2000 Elsevier

   pleomorphic adenoma, in the tubular type of basal cell adenoma, and
   seldom in the tubular type of adenoid cystic carcinoma. Modified
   myoepithelial cells of pleomorphic adenoma and myoepithelioma exhibited
   a variable immunoprofile. CKs 7 and 8 were also observed in acinar cell
   adenocarcinoma and polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma with vimentin

Abstract = {{Objective. To measure circulating levels of soluble E-selectin
   (sE-selectin), sP-selectin, and soluble intercellular adhesion
   molecule-1 (sICAM-1) in patients with active juvenile idiopathic
   arthritides (JIA), and to evaluate their correlation with disease
   activity variables and cytokine levels.
   Methods. Serum levels of sE-selectin, sP-selectin, and sICAM-1 were
   measured by ELISA in 42 patients with JIA and in 15 healthy controls.
   Results. Circulating levels of sE-selectin and sICAM-1, but not
   sP-selectin, were significantly elevated in patients with active
   systemic JIA. In patients with active polyarticular or pauciarticular
   JIA serum levels of sE-selectin, sP-selectin, and sICAM-1 were
   comparable to those of controls. In patients with systemic JIA, levels
   of sE-selectin and sICAM-1 were significantly correlated with levels of
   soluble turner necrosis factor receptor 2 (sTNFR2), but not with those
   of interleukin 6 (lL-6) or IL-1 beta.
   Conclusion. Patients with active systemic JIA have elevated circulating
   levels of sE-selectin and sICAM-1. The correlation with sTNFR2, together
   with previous data on the TNF system in systemic JIA, suggests that TNF
   activated endothelial cells are the source of sE-selectin and sICAM-1 in
   this disease.}},

Abstract = {{A large variety of natural products have been described as anti-HIV
   agents, and for a portion thereof the target of interaction has been
   identified. Cyanovirin-N, a 11-kDa protein from Cyanobacterium
   (blue-green alga) irreversibly inactivates HIV and also aborts
   cell-to-cell fusion and transmission of HIV, due to its high-affinity
   interaction with gp120. Various sulfated polysaccharides extracted from
   seaweeds (i.e., Nothogenia fastigiata, Aghardhiella tenera) inhibit the
   virus adsorption process. Ingenol derivatives may inhibit virus
   adsorption at least in part through down-regulation of CD4 molecules on
   the host cells. Inhibition of virus adsorption by flavanoids such as
   (-)epicatechin and its 3-O-gallate has been attributed to an
   irreversible interaction with gp120 (although these compounds are also
   known as reverse transcriptase inhibitors). For the triterpene
   glycyrrhizin (extracted from the licorice root Glycyrrhiza radix) the
   mode of anti-HIV action may at least in part be attributed to
   interference with virus-cell binding. The mannose-specific plant lectins
   from Galanthus, Hippeastrum, Narcissus, Epipactis helleborine, and
   Listera ovata, and the N-acetylglucosamine-specific lectin from Urtica
   dioica would primarily be targeted at the virus-cell fusion process.
   Various other natural products seem to qualify as HIV-cell fusion
   inhibitors: the siamycins {[}siamycin I(BMY-29304), siamycin II (RP
   71955, BMY 29303), and NP-06 (FR901724)] which are tricyclic
   21-amino-acid peptides isolated from Streptomyces spp that differ from
   one another only at position 4 or 17 (valine or isoleucine in each
   case); the betulinic acid derivative RPR 103611, and the peptides
   tachyplesin and polyphemusin which are highly abundant in hemocyte
   debris of the horseshoe crabs Tachypleus tridentatus and Limulus
   polyphemus, i.e., the 18-amino-acid peptide T22 from which T134 has been
   derived. Both T22 and T134 have been shown to block T-tropic X4 HIV-1
   strains through a specific antagonism with the HIV coreceptor CXCR4. A
   number of natural products have been reported to interact with the
   reverse transcriptase, i.e., baicalin, avarol, avarone, psychotrine,
   phloroglucinol derivatives, and, in particular, calanolides (from the
   tropical rainforest tree, Calophyllum lanigerum) and inophyllums (from
   the Malaysian tree, Calophyllum inophyllum). The natural marine
   substance illimaquinone would be targeted at the RNase H function of the
   reverse transcriptase. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane, from turmeric, the
   roots/rhizomes of Curcuma spp), dicaffeoylquinic and dicaffeoyltartaric
   acids, L-chicoric acid, and a number of fungal metabolites (equisetin,
   phomasetin, oteromycin, and integric acid) have all been proposed as
   HIV-1 integrase inhibitors. Yet, we have recently shown that L-chicoric
   acid owes its anti-HIV activity to a specific interaction with the viral
   envelope gp120 rather than integrase. A number of compounds would be
   able to inhibit HIV-1 gene expression at the transcription level: the
   flavonoid chrysin (through inhibition of casein kinase II, the
   antibacterial peptides melittin (from bee venom) and cecropin, and
   EM2487, a novel substance produced by Streptomyces. Alpha-Trichosanthin
   (from the root tubers of Trichosanthes kirilowii), MAP30 (from Momordica
   charantia), GAP31 (from Gelonium multiflorum), DAP30 and DAP32 (from
   Dianthus caryophyllus) would act as RIPs (ribosome-inactivating
   proteins), suppressing the translation process.
   As glycosylation inhibitors, castanospermine and 1-deoxynojirimycin
   would interfere with the infectivity and secondary spread of HIV-1. And
   so would bellenamine {[}(R)-3,6-diamino-N-((aminomethyl)hex anamide]
   (from Streptomyces nashvillensis), albeit by an unknown mechanism.
   Hypericin and pseudohypericin, two aromatic polycyclic diones from
   Hypericum triquetrifolium (St. Johnswort), could block HIV-1 infection
   through a variety of mechanisms (direct virucidal effect, inhibition of
   secondary virus spread, inhibition of virus budding, and inactivation of
   the preintegration complex). A number of miscellaneous compounds,
   including propolis, pokeweed antiviral protein, and michellamines
   inhibit HIV replication by mechanisms that still have to be resolved.
   Cyclosporins do so by preventing the interaction of cyclophilin A with
   the capsid gag proteins, thus blocking both a late event (assembly) and
   early event (nuclear localization of the preintegration complex) in the
   HIV replicative cycle. (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons. Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Follistatin is a secreted protein, which functions as an antagonist of
   different members of the TGF-beta superfamily, including activin and
   bone morphogenetic proteins. Expression of follistatin is tightly
   regulated during mouse development both spatially and temporally. In
   order to study the regulation of follistatin expression in the mouse
   embryo we have cloned and analyzed part of the 5' flanking region of the
   murine follistatin gene. Primer extension and RNase protection assays
   demonstrate that the murine follistatin promoter region has at least
   three distinct transcription initiation sites, which are each preceded
   by a TATA box. All of the transcription initiation sites are located
   within the first 500 bp upstream of the translational start site.
   Sequence analysis of this 500 bp region revealed several consensus
   binding sites for transcription factors including AP-1, Brachyury-T,
   CREB, Sp1, AP-2 and Tcf. To test whether the 5' region displays promoter
   activity, we transfected various 5' flanking region deletion constructs
   into F9 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells and into P19 EC cells. In these
   two cell lines a region of only 262 bp upstream of the translation start
   site could drive reporter expression in a manner that reflects
   endogenous mRNA expression.}},

Abstract = {{The immediate-early gene hzf-3, also known as nurr1, is a member of the
   inducible orphan nuclear receptor family and is one candidate in the
   search for genes associated with learning and memory processes. Here we
   report that acquisition of a spatial food search task; is accompanied by
   elevated levels of hzf-3 mRNA in the hippocampus. Adult male Long-Evans
   rats were handled, food-restricted, and allowed to habituate to the maze
   prior to training. During acquisition, rats were given one training
   session per day for 5 days. Each training session consisted of five
   trials in which animals searched the maze for food located in 3 of 16
   holes in the floor of the maze, Training resulted in spatial acquisition
   of the task. Northern blot analysis showed significant increases in
   hippocampal hzf-3 mRNA 3 h after training in the maze. Next, brains were
   obtained from Naive, Habituated, Day 1, Day 3, and Day 5 animals and
   processed for in situ hybridization. The results showed significant
   increases of hzf-3 mRNA in CA1 and CA3 subregions of the dorsal
   hippocampus during acquisition of the task. We conclude that expression
   of the hzf-3 gene in the brain is associated with long-term spatial
   memory processes, The present results are the first to implicate an
   orphan nuclear receptor in long-term information storage in the
   hippocampus. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{The flow in turbomachinery is strongly influenced by the rotor-stator
   interactions. It is known that the unsteadiness of the flow has for
   effect re advance the laminar-turbulent transition and to alter the heat

   studied experimentally by using a simplified geometrical configuration.
   The stator blade is simulated by a flat plate on which the development
   of the boundary layer disturbed by periodic wakes is observed. The wakes
   are generated by moving bars having a circular section, put upstream of
   the flat plate and running with a constant velocity in the wind of a
   low-speed tunnel. Numerical studies relating to the phenomenon of
   interaction are limited. Part of the experimental study has been carried
   out in a fully turbulent flow in order to avoid the problem of
   transition. These results are compared with those from a code solving

Abstract = {{The interaction of amino acids with the major constituents of natural
   waters has been studied potentiometrically by determining protonation
   constants at different ionic strengths (e.g., I less than or equal to
   5.6 mol (kg H(2)O)(-1) (NaCl)) and in artificial seawater (containing
   Na(+), K(+), Ca(2+), Mg(2+), Cl(-) and SO(4)(2-)) at different
   salinities. For glycine determinations in mixed NaCl-MgCl(2) electrolyte
   solutions were also performed. The data included in this work, together
   with some already published, make it possible to calculate parameters
   for dependence on ionic strength using different models, i.e. an
   extended Debye-Huckel type equation and Pitzer equations. The results
   can be interpreted both in terms of specific interaction and in terms of
   complex formation. The formation constants of Mg(2+)-glycine complexes
   have been calculated from protonation data in mixed Na(+)-Mg(2+)
   solutions at high ionic strength: a simple method for taking into
   account the different composition, at constant ionic strength, is
   reported. The overall complexing ability of major seawater components
   towards amino acids has been calculated from potentiometric data in
   artificial seawater using the single salt approximation. The relevance
   of the data reported in this work is discussed in connection with
   speciation problems. Particular attention has been paid to finding some

Abstract = {{Balloon dilatation of valvar and vascular stenoses has become routine
   therapy in pediatric cardiology, Repeated balloon inflations cause many
   episodes of low cerebral oxygen delivery. This study is a prospective
   study to assess the effects of balloon dilatation on cerebral perfusion
   and oxygenation. The study included 11 patients scheduled for elective
   catheterization and balloon dilatation at a university pediatric
   hospital. Blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (V-mca) and
   regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO(2)) were monitored by means of
   transcranial Doppler sonography and near infrared spectroscopy,
   respectively. In group 1, consisting of 6 patients without an
   intracardiac shunt, inflation of the balloon resulted in a decrease in
   V-mca followed by a minor decrease in rSO(2). In group 2, consisting of
   5 patients with an interatrial communication, inflation resulted in an
   increase in right-to-left shunt fraction, arterial desaturation, and a
   major decrease in rSO(2) with minor changes in V-mca. Balloon dilatation
   causes an important decrease in cerebral oxygen delivery by different
   mechanisms. This may lead to serious morbidity and even mortality.
   Neuromonitoring is a useful tool in assessing the cerebral effects of
   balloon dilatation and brain recovery.}},

   773] suggested that these findings might be accounted for, in part, by
   alterations in cerebral nitric oxide (NO) and its byproduct,
   peroxynitrite. The current experiment tested this hypothesis by altering
   NO levels via manipulations of dietary L-arginine (ARG), the dietary
   precursor of NO, in mice transgenic for HD. Seventy-one mice were
   assigned at 12 weeks of age to one of three isocaloric diets that varied
   in their content of ARG. These diets included: (a) 0\% ARG, (b) 1.2\%
   ARG (i.e. typical mouse chow), or (c) 5\% ARG. The 5\% ARG diets in HD
   mice accelerated the time of onset of body weight loss (P<0.05) and
   motor impairments (P<0.05), and increased resting CBF in HD relative to
   control (P<0.05). Conversely, the 0\% ARG diet demonstrated no loss of
   body weight and had no changes in CBF relative to controls. However, the
   0\% ARG HD group continued to show significant deficits on motor testing
   (P<0.05). The 1.2\% ARG HD group showed reduced body weight loss, better
   motor functioning, and fewer changes in CBF compared to the 5\% ARG HD
   group. Immunocytochemistry analysis found greater deposition of
   nitrotyrosine in the cortex, and vasculature, of HD+ mice, 58 and
   1.2\%>0\% arginine diets. When collapsed across all conditions, CBF
   inversely correlated (P<0.05) both with the body weight and motor
   changes suggesting that changes in CBF are associated with behavioral
   decline in HD mice. Collectively, these findings indicate that dietary
   consumption of the NO precursor ARG has a measurable, but complex,
   effect on symptom progression in HD transgenic mice, and implicates NO
   in the pathophysiology of HD. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science BN. All rights

Abstract = {{Designing synthetic vaccines from class I major histocompatibility
   complex (MHC)-binding antigenic peptides requires not only knowledge of
   the binding affinity of the designed peptide but also predicting the
   stability of the formed MHC-peptide complex. In order to better
   investigate structure-stability relationships, we have determined by
   circular dichroism spectroscopy the thermal stability of a class I MHC
   protein, HLA-B{*}2705, in complex with a set of 39 singly substituted
   peptide analogues. The influence of two anchoring side chains (P3 and
   P9) was studied by peptide mutation and appropriate site directed
   mutagenesis of the HLA-B{*}2705 binding groove. The side chain at P9 is
   clearly the one that contributes the most to the thermal stability of
   the MHC-peptide complexes, as destabilization up to 25 degrees C are
   obtained after P9 mutation. Interestingly, structure-stability
   relationships do not fully mirror structure-binding relationships. ks
   important as the C-terminal side chain are the terminal ammonium and
   carboxylate groups. Removal of a single II-bond between HLA-B27 and the
   terminal peptide moieties results in thermal destabilization up to 10
   degrees C. Depending on the bound peptide and the location of the
   deleted II-bond, the decrease in the thermal stability of the
   corresponding complex is quantitatively different. The present study
   suggests that any peptidic amino acid at positions 3 and 9 promotes
   refolding of the B27-peptide complex. Once the complex is formed, the
   C-terminal side chain seems to play an important role for maintaining a
   stable complex.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the molecular mechanism of resistance in herpes simplex
   Virus type 1 (HSV-1) thymidine kinase (TK) gene-transfected murine
   mammary carcinoma (FM3ATK(-)/HSV-1 TK+) cells, that were selected for
   resistance against (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (BVDU) and
   ganciclovir (GCV) by prolonged exposure of the cell cultures to
   dose-escalating concentrations of these compounds. Drug-resistant
   FM3ATK(-)/HSV-1 TK+ cells showed marked differences in their sensitivity
   spectrum to a series of antiherpetic nucleoside analogues.
   BVDU-resistant FM3ATK(-)/HSV-1 TK+ cells displayed the same sensitivity
   profile as wild-type FM3A/0 cells. In contrast, GCV-resistant
   FM3ATK(-)/HSV-1 TK+ cells were still sensitive to BVDU,
   (E)5-(2-iodovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (IVDU) and
   (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxycytidine (BVDC), a typical feature of
   FM3ATK(-) cells lacking cytosolic TK. Southern blot and PCR analysis
   revealed that HSV-1 TK genes were not deleted from the genome of the
   drug-resistant FM3ATK(-)/HSV-1 TK+ cells. However, the TK genes in
   drug-resistant FM3ATK(-)/HSV-1 TK+ cells were shown to be heavily
   methylated. Accordingly, RT-PCR demonstrated the complete abrogation of
   TK mRNA production resulting in a complete loss Of TK enzyme activity in

Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to assess quantitatively and qualitatively the
   ability of magnetization transfer imaging to follow in vivo
   remyelination. Demyelination lesions were induced in rats by the
   injection of L-alpha-lysophosphatidylcholine stearoyl into the corpus
   callosum and imaging was performed in vivo on a 4.7-Tesla system at
   different time points. The percentage of magnetization transfer ratio
   (MTR) decrease was calculated for each animal. To evaluate the MTR
   findings for remyelination, myelin was quantitated by histological
   analysis of the lesion size and counting the number of remyelinating
   axons. An MTR decrease was observed when demyelination was present at 7
   days after injection. During the remyelinating phase between day 30 and
   40 after injection, contralateral values almost complete returned to
   normal, thus indicating remyelination. Histologically, at days 30 and 40
   after injection, the lesion area was reduced in size and the axons were
   surrounded by a thin myelin sheath, indicating the remyelination
   process. Statistical analysis showed that the profile of MTR values was
   significantly correlated with the course of remyelination. All the MTR
   changes show a correlation with both myelin damage and repair. In
   conclusion, the study of the MTR profile in this myelin lesion model
   demonstrates in vivo the loss of myelin and the presence of spontaneous
   remyelination. This methodological approach which can also be applied to
   multiple sclerosis patients to show demyelination, should prove helpful
   to determine the degree of spontaneous and therapeutically induced
   remyelination in multiple sclerosis lesions, and thus to validate
   therapeutic treatments for myelin repair. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V,

   ulcerative colitis, acute ileitis, and controls. Immunohistochemical
   stainings for E-cadherin, alpha-catenin, beta-catenin and gamma-catenin
   were performed. E-cadherin messenger RNA (mRNA) was detected using
   riboprobes. In active inflammation, there was up-regulation of the
   complex. In particular; epithelium adjacent to ulcers showed increased
   expression of protein and mRNA, but in ulcer-associated cell lineage the
   intensity of staining was weak to negative In focal inflammation,
   up-regulation was found in affected areas. Reparative epithelium growing
   over denuded areas showed weaker expression.
   Since structural or functional perturbation in any of the molecules of
   the E-cadherin-catenin complex results in loss of intercellular
   adhesion, the preexistent epithelium may benefit from up-regulation to
   try to maintain its normal architecture under inflammatory conditions.

   living polymerization of NCAs. In these systems, polymer molecular
   weights are controlled by monomer-to-initiator stoichiometry,

   within the width is represented by a Lorentzian contour, and the line
   wings decay as (omega - omega (0))(-4). It is demonstrated that a
   similar contour is observed for the lines corresponding to the intrinsic
   vibrations of clusters with hinged bonds, which form the boson peak. The
   shape of the line at 806 cm(-1) for vitreous boron oxide, which is

Abstract = {{Laplace's law constrains how thin the ventricular wall may be without
   experiencing excessive stress. The present study investigated
   constraints, imposed by myocardial viscosity (resistance to internal
   rearrangement), on how thick the wall may be. The ventricle was modeled
   as a contracting, spherical shell. The analysis demonstrated that
   viscosity generates stress and energy dissipation with inverse fourth-
   and eighth-power dependence, respectively, on distance from the cavity
   center. This result derives from the combination of squared dependence
   of viscous forces on shearing velocity gradients and the greater shear
   rearrangement required for inner layers of a contracting sphere. These
   predictions are based solely on geometry and fundamentals of viscosity
   and are independent of material properties, cytoskeletal structure, and
   internal structural forces. Calculated values of energy and force
   required to overcome viscosity were clearly large enough to affect the
   extent of thickening of the left ventricle. It is concluded that
   load-independent viscous resistance to contraction is an important
   factor in cardiac mechanics, especially of the thickened ventricles of
   concentric hypertrophy.}},

Abstract = {{A series of 10 consecutive cases presenting an obstructive fibrinous
   tracheal pseudomembrane (OFTP) as a complication of endotracheal
   intubation is presented. The patients developed a thick tubular,

   firmly adhered to the tracheal wall at the site of the endotracheal
   cuff, Shortly after extubation, partial detachment of the proximal part
   of the pseudomembrane produced intermittent positional acute respiratory
   failure due to valve-manner tracheal obstruction. Immediate mechanical
   ablation was curative in nine patients, without secondary development of
   tracheal stenosis. One patient died from acute asphyxiation. The history
   and the pathological findings of these cases support the hypothesis that
   this lesion represents an early stage of ischemic tracheal wall injury
   related to the cuff pressure. Pulmonary physicians should be alerted on

Abstract = {{Over 200 distinct herbicide resistant weed biotypes have evolved
   worldwide. In most of these, resistance is conferred by an altered

   that target most major known sites of action, including those that
   inhibit photosynthetic electron transfer at photosystem II, acetyl-CoA
   carboxylase, acetolactate synthase, and tubulin polymerization. Patterns
   of cross-resistance to structurally similar herbicides and those from
   Ether chemical classes that target the same site vary, depending on the
   mutation and its effect on protein steric and electronic properties.
   Mechanisms of target site-based herbicide resistance are reviewed, with

Abstract = {{The radiation damage induced in Si(100) due to 1.5 MeV Sb ions has been
   studied as a function of fluence using the Rutherford
   backscattering/channeling (RBS/C) technique and Raman spectroscopy. The
   damage profiles have been extracted from the RBS/C spectra and the
   results compared with SRIM'97 code calculations. For a fluence of
   1x10(14) ions/cm(2), though the position of the damage profile is in
   agreement with the defect profile calculated using SRIM code, theory
   overestimates the damage in the surface region, suggesting dynamic
   self-beam annealing. The total amount of damage obtained as a function
   of implant dose exhibits two behaviors; a small net damage and a slow
   rate of damage accumulation for low fluences with a crossover to faster
   rates beyond a dose of 1 x 10(13) ions/cm(2). At this dose, a
   defected-amorphized zone of a critical size can form, which may easily
   enlarge by further accumulation of defects at higher fluences. The total
   damage has been compared with the results from Raman scattering and it
   is observed that the net damage as detected by Raman is slightly higher
   at the fluences where crystalline and amorphous zones coexist. The
   crystalline-to-amorphous (c/a) transition in Si as a function of fluence
   has been investigated by RBS/C and Raman scattering. The study
   demonstrates that Raman scattering is more effective in probing the
   small concentrations of defects produced during the early stages of c/a
   transition. (C) 2000 American Vacuum Society. {[}S0734-211X(00)00305-X].}},

Abstract = {{Nonlinear dynamic analysis was used to examine the chaotic behavior of
   renal sympathetic nerve activity in conscious rats subjected to either
   complete baroreceptor denervation (sinoaortic and cardiac baroreceptor
   denervation) or induction of congestive heart failure (CHF). The peak
   interval sequence of synchronized renal sympathetic nerve discharge was
   extracted and used for analysis. In control rats, this yielded a system
   whose correlation dimension converged to a low value over the embedding
   dimension range of 10-15 and whose greatest Lyapunov exponent was
   positive. Complete baroreceptor denervation was associated with a
   decrease in the correlation dimension of the system (before 2.65 +/-
   0.27, after 1.64 +/- 0.17; P < 0.01) and a reduction in chaotic behavior
   (greatest Lyapunov exponent: 0.201 +/- 0.008 bits/data point before,
   0.177 +/- 0.004 bits/data point after, P < 0.02). CHF, a state
   characterized by impaired sinoaortic and cardiac baroreceptor regulation
   of renal sympathetic nerve activity, was associated with a similar
   decrease in the correlation dimension (control 3.41 +/- 0.23, CHF 2.62

   Lyapunov exponent: 0.205 +/- 0.048 bits/data point control, 0.136 +/-
   0.033 bits/data point CHF, P < 0.02). These results indicate that
   removal of sinoaortic and cardiac baroreceptor regulation of renal

Abstract = {{We investigated the population consequences of multiple behavioral
   responses of grazers to a foraging return-predation risk trade-off in an
   open system consisting of primary producers, grazers, and predators.
   Using a dynamical model where grazers adjust their foraging activity and
   emigration rate to the densities of predators and producers, we explored
   how changes in control variables (predator density, grazer immigration,
   and producer immigration and carrying capacity) affect the dynamics of
   producers and grazers at temporal scales shorter than consumer and
   predator reproduction. The model predicts that producer biomass
   increases and that both the density of foraging grazers and the feeding
   rate of predators decrease with predator density. These predictions hold
   although total (foraging + nonforaging) grazer density may actually
   increase with predator density. The latter will occur whenever the
   benefit of higher resource density outweighs the increased risk of
   predation. In this case. per capita grazer emigration decreases with
   predator density, which might be misinterpreted as a direct
   ``freezing{''} response to predators. Increased grazer immigration is
   predicted to result in decreased producer density and increased
   densities of both foraging and total grazers, as well as increased
   grazer emigration and predator feeding rates. Increased producer
   immigration or carrying capacity should increase producer and grazer
   densities and predator feeding rate but decrease per capita grazer
   emigration. Manipulation of predator (trout) densities in a set of nine
   large (50 m(2)) stream channels produced results in broad agreement with
   model predictions. Most notably, a positive effect of trout on benthic
   algal biomass was mainly mediated through grazer behavior (changes in
   the use of epibenthic surfaces and in emigration rare) rather than
   through consumptive reductions of grazer numbers by trout.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the influence of dentin conditioning and
   contamination on the marginal adaptation of Class II sandwich
   restorations.
   Large butt-joint MOD cavities with cervical mm below the CEJ were cut
   into 72 extracted were filled using Z100 or a sandwich technique with
   either Vitremer or F2000 in combination with Z100. For all three
   material combinations three different pretreatments were compared: total
   etch, selective etch and dentin contamination with saliva and blood
   prior to primer/adhesive application. After water storage for 21 days
   and thermocycling (2000x, 5 - 55 degrees C) replicas were produced for
   quantitative marginal analysis in the SEM. Teeth were immersed in 0.5\%
   basic fuchsin for 24 hours and dried. Percent dye penetration over the
   total marginal length was analyzed in three layers using a sequential
   grinding techique. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-way
   ANOVA. Post-hoc analyses were carried out with univariate
   Mann-Whitney-U-tests adjusting for multiple comparisons by a
   sequentially rejective test procedure (Bonferroni-Holm) at p<0.05.
   Both F2000 and Vitremer sandwich restorations showed better marginal
   adaptation than Z100 total-bond restorations with all pretreatments.
   Acid etching of the dentin significantly influenced the marginal
   adaptation of Z100 total-bond restorations and Vitremer sandwich
   restorations. All types of restorations showed considerable
   microleakage. On contaminated dentin, sandwich restorations showed
   better marginal integrity than total-bond restorations. Marginal
   adaptation did not correspond with microleakage in all groups.
   In conclusion, F2000/Z100 and Vitremer/Z100 sandwich restorations show
   better marginal adaptation than Z100 total-bond restorations in large
   Class II cavities with cervical margins in dentin. Microleakage cannot
   predictably be prevented with the sandwich technique, Sandwich
   restorations seem to be less sensitive to contamination with saliva and
   blood.}},

Abstract = {{The pretherapeutic hemoglobin level (Hb) has been postulated to
   constitute a prognostic marker for outcome after primary chemoradiation
   of patients with advanced cancer of the head and neck. However, this
   hypothesis has not been tested systematically in large study samples.
   In the years 1992-1997, 125 patients with advanced head and neck cancer
   (stages III-IV UICC) were treated with primarychemoradiation in two
   different prospective multicentric trials, 62 patients in trial A (phase
   II,1992-1995), and 63 in trial B (phase III, 1995-1997). Beside initial
   Hb, other pretherapeutic parameters with potential prognostic relevance
   were assessed and correlated with clinical outcome after 43-months
   follow-up: total tumor volume (TTV; calculated in initial CT scans),
   tumor oxygenation (polarographic measurements with Eppendorf
   histography),TNM, tumor localization, age, and performance status.
   The evaluation of the clinical end points (progression-free and overall
   survival and local tumor control) revealed that Hb and TTV were
   independent parameters with strong predictive character of outcome after
   primary chemoradiation in both trials (n=125). Bivariate analysis showed
   < median (13.5 g/dl) a hazard ratio of 2.1 (P=0.002) for Hb: and >
   median (98 ml) a Hazard ratio of 2.0 (P=0.006) for TTV. Severe anemia
   (Hb<10 g/dl) was an adverse factor in three patients. Hypoxia was
   associated with poorer initial therapeutical response but was not
   predictive of clinical outcome. Furthermore, tumor oxygenation showed no
   correlation with Hb. The other parameters examined failed to show
   prognostic significance.
   Our results indicate a high prognostic value of initial Hb for outcome
   after primary chemoradiation in advanced head and neck cancer and imply
   a therapeutic benefit of Hb substitution or erythropoietin
   administration. We propose to test this in randomized clinical trials.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous methods have been described for the separation and purification

   potential use in radionuclide generator systems, the application of the
   technique to generator development has thus far been limited. Recent
   work directed at improved methods for the determination of radionuclides
   in biological and environmental samples has led to the development of a
   series of novel extraction chromatographic resins exhibiting enhanced
   metal ion retention from strongly acidic media and excellent
   selectivity, among them materials suitable for the isolation of Bi-212,
   Y-90, and Bi-213. These resins, along with extraction chromatographic
   materials employing functionalized supports to improve their physical
   stability or metal ion retention properties, are shown to offer promise

Abstract = {{Aims. The late reocclusion or restenosis rate of the infarct related
   artery is frequent after primary angioplasty. An implanted stent may be
   able to improve the coronary angioplasty results and long-term outcome
   of these patients. We present the clinical and angiographic outcome of a
   cohort of patients treated with primary stenting.
   Patients and methods. A group of 74 consecutive patients with acute
   myocardial infarction treated with primary angioplasty and stenting were
   followed for one year. An angiographic control was performed at the 6th
   month of follow-up in 91\% of patients to assess the restenosis and
   reocclusion rates of the infarct-related artery.
   Results. There were eight in-hospital deaths and three during follow-up
   (mortality rate 14.8\%) and one non-fatal reinfarction (1.5\%). The
   cumulative rate of recurrent ischemia was 6\% at 3 months and 15\% at 6
   months, without any further increment at one-year follow-up. A new
   angioplasty was performed in 7 patients and three patients underwent
   surgical revascularization. Thus 80\% of patients after discharge were
   free of events. The angiographic control showed only one reocclusion of
   the infarct related artery and a reestenosis rate of 27\%.
   Conclusions. These results show that primary stenting is an effective
   procedure in treating non-selected patients with acute myocardial
   infarction with a low long-term incidence of adverse events and a low
   restenosis rate.}},

   mass index, VO2 max, insulin, glucose, FFA, glycerol, and leptin were
   not affected by the season. Total cholesterol was higher in the winter
   than in the summer (157 +/- 5.5 vs. 148 +/- 4.2 mg/dL respectively; P =
   0.03). The ATLPL activity was also higher in the winter than in the
   summer (4.4 +/-: 0.8 vs. 2.3 +/- 0.6 nmol FFA/10(6) cells min; P =
   0.04). SMLPL activity trended to be higher in the winter than in the
   summer (1.9 +/- 0.5 vs. 1.0 +/- 0.1 nmol FFA/g min; P = 0.06).
   In summary, ATLPL is seasonally regulated. It appears that SMLPL is
   similarly regulated by season. For physically active lean subjects, this
   increase in SMLPL may be a compensatory mechanism to help protect from
   seasonal weight gain.}},

Abstract = {{Using a dark enclosed chamber technique, the fluxes of CO2, N2O and CH4
   from nature and disturbed grassland were measured on the spot in Inner
   Mongolian Temperate Grassland along the annual rainfall gradient section
   ranging from 450 to 200 mm. The results showed that the measured mean
   fluxes of CO2, N2O and CH4 were (1180.4 +/- 308,7), (0.010 +/- 0.004)
   and (-0.039 +/- 0.016) mg.m(-2)/h, respectively. The decrease of the
   fluxes of CO2, N2O and CH4 follows with that of annual rainfall gradient
   in the measurement area. Human activities, such as grazing and
   reclamation are also critical factors to affect the fluxes of these
   gases from grassland. Daily continuous measurement of CO2, N2O and CH4
   fluxes showed a strong diurnal variation with higher emission in the
   daytime. A good relationship between the fluxes of COB, N2O, CH4 and
   temperature was exposed in this study.}},

Abstract = {{Renal failure in humans is associated with electrocardiographic changes
   including altered QT interval dispersion, which suggests that cardiac
   myocyte repolarization is abnormal and which appears to correlate with
   cardiac prognosis. In this study, cardiac myocyte repolarizing currents
   have been studied in isolated cells from rats 8 wk after subtotal
   nephrectomy (SNx), using sham-operated animals as controls. In addition,
   monophasic cardiac action potentials were recorded from the epicardial
   surface of the left ventricle (LV) apex, LV base, and the right
   ventricle of isolated perfused hearts paced at 320/min. SNx was
   associated with cardiac hypertrophy and histologic evidence of
   myocardial fibrosis, but SNx rats were not hypertensive. Repolarizing K+
   currents were measured using whole-cell patch-clamp, and 4-aminopyridine
   (4-AP)-sensitive transient outward (I-to) and 4-AP-insensitive sustained
   outward (I-so) components were quantified. After SNx, I-to was increased
   by two to threefold at voltages from -30 to +60 mV and showed increased
   heterogeneity. For example, at 0 mV voltage clamp pulse, the median I-to
   was increased from 3.23 pA/pF in control myocytes (interquartile range
   3.20 pA/pF, n = 24) to 5.86 pA/pF in SNx myocytes (interquartile range
   7.32 pA/pF, n = 21, P < 0.005). The kinetics of inactivation of I-to
   were altered after SNx with slowing both of the onset and the recovery
   from inactivation. The mean time constant of inactivation at +30 mV
   after SNx was 14.2 +/- 1.6 ms (n = 20) compared with control values of
   9.8 +/- 0.6 ms (n = 23, P < 0.05). Neither I-so nor inward rectifier K+
   currents were altered after SNx. The action potential duration (APD(50))
   at the left ventricular base was approximately 20\% shorter (P < 0.02)
   in hearts from SNx rats compared with controls. 4-AP (2 mM) prolonged
   the APD(50) in all regions in hearts from both SNx and control rats and
   abolished the APD(50) shortening in SNx. These results indicate that
   abnormalities of the cardiac transient outward K+ current contribute to
   alterations in the cardiac action potential in renal failure and warrant
   further investigation because they may contribute to altered
   repolarization and arrythmogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{We present the results of a ship survey conducted from Italy to
   Antarctica and back during the 1996-1997 solar minimum measuring the
   latitude variation in the neutron component of cosmic radiation at sea
   level. High-energy atmospheric neutrons were detected by a 3NM-64 and
   thermalized atmospheric neutrons were detected by two bare BF3 counters.
   Discussions of the interval consistency of the data and the stability of
   the detectors, investigations of meteorological effects, and data
   corrections are presented in two companion papers. In this paper we
   compute updated vertical cutoff rigidities corrected for the penumbra
   effect, and we estimate apparent cutoff rigidities, which take into
   account the contribution of nonvertically incident particles to the
   counting rate. When comparing cosmic ray intensities observed in the
   same place, a small forward-backward effect is found and explained as
   the effect of an asymmetric shielding structure around the monitor.
   Latitude dependencies (i.e., neutron intensities versus cutoff rigidity)
   and associated coupling functions' are computed for both monitors and
   compared. The NM latitude dependence obtained for the 1996-1997 solar
   minimum is found to be almost identical to that obtained by other
   authors in the previous solar minimum. The absence of the so-called
   ``crossover{''} effect when comparing coupling functions of subsequent
   solar minima is discussed also on the basis of cosmic ray intensity
   changes observed by neutron monitor stations.}},

Abstract = {{Color constancy was investigated in behavioral training experiments on

   simultaneously on a black background. During training the tank in which
   the fish were swimming freely was illuminated with white light. Correct
   choices were rewarded with food. During the tests differently saturated
   yellow or blue illumination was used. The degree of color constancy was
   inferred from the choice behavior under these illuminations. Perfect
   color constancy was found up to a certain degree of saturation of the
   colored light. Beyond this level test fields other than the training
   test field were chosen, indicating imperfect color constancy. Color
   constancy was quantified by applying color metrics on the basis of the

Volume = {{56}},

Abstract = {{One of the recently described antigens broadly expressed on human
   leukocytes is CDw149, which was defined at the 6th Human Leukocyte
   Differentiation Antigen (HLDA) Workshop by means of 2 monoclonal
   antibodies (mAbs). Molecular characterization of this antigen has been
   lacking. In the present study we demonstrate that these anti-CDw149 mAbs
   actually recognize a clustered subset of a well-defined membrane
   protein, CD47, also known as integrin-associated protein (IAP). This
   clustered subset is present on leukocytes but not erythrocytes. The
   anti-CDw149 mAbs bind with only low affinity to a monomeric
   (unclustered) subset of CD47 but with high avidity to the CD47 clusters.
   A fraction of CD47 is associated with large complexes containing
   cytoplasmic signaling molecules (Src family kinases and heterotrimeric
   G-proteins) similar to glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains (GEMs),
   which may explain the previously described signaling capacity of CD47.
   The low-affinity anti-CD47 mAbs may be useful tools targeting specific
   receptor complexes involved in cell activation. Specific reactivity of
   low-affinity mAbs with clustered subsets of cell surface antigens may
   more generally explain the nature of poorly defined ``activation
   forms{''} or activation neoepitopes described previously for several
   cell surface molecules.}},

   and UPGMA (unweighted pair group method using average linkages) cluster
   analysis. All C, jejuni strains shelved highly heterogeneous
   fingerprints, and no fingerprints exclusive for chicken strains or for
   human strains were obtained. All strains were separated in two distinct
   genetic groups. In group A the percentage of human strains was
   significantly higher and may be an indication that genotypes of this

Abstract = {{Background Tetrabamate (Atrium(R)), widely used in the treatment of
   tremor and ethanol-withdrawal symptoms, has been incriminated as a
   potential cause of reversible acute hepatitis.
   Objective We report here on 11 patients who experienced
   tetrabamate-related liver injury, in order to evaluate their clinical,
   histopathological and evolutive features.
   Patients and methods Between 1987 and 1998, 34 cases of
   tetrabamate-associated acute hepatitis were spontaneously reported to
   the regional pharmacovigilance center of Lyon. Eleven cases were
   considered probably to be drug-induced.
   Results There were three males and eight females aged 31-82 years (mean,
   57 years). The duration of treatment ranged from 33 to 206 days, and
   indication for treatment was depressive disorders, tremor or prevention
   of alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Clinical symptoms were asthenia (n = 9),
   jaundice (n = 3) and/or diffuse rash (n = 3). The pattern of liver
   injury was cytolytic (n = 10) or cholestatic (n = 1). Three patients
   presented biological features of hepatic failure. A percutaneous liver
   biopsy was performed in six patients. Histological examination of the
   liver specimen showed a large spectrum of lesions: massive
   hepatocellular necrosis (n = 1), centrilobular and nonconfluent
   hepatocyte necrosis (n = 2), intracellular cholestasis (n = 3), and
   granulomatous hepatitis (n = 1), Tetrabamate was discontinued in all
   patients. In seven patients, a complete recovery was observed 3 weeks to
   3 months after drug withdrawal. Two patients, despite a rapid
   improvement of liver function tests, died from unrelated causes. The
   remaining two patients died from irreversible hepatic failure.
   Conclusions Our data strongly suggest that tetrabamate may induce acute
   liver injury, which may eventually result in life-threatening liver
   failure, (C) 2000 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.}},

Abstract = {{This case describes a 39-yr-old male, presenting with left hemiplegia
   after a road traffic accident involving frontal deceleration and airbag
   deployment. Brain computerized tomography (CT) scan revealed a right
   parietal lobe infarct. Contrast angiography demonstrated bilateral
   internal carotid artery dissection and fibromuscular dysplasia. The
   patient was treated with systemic heparinization. Neurological
   improvement, evidenced by full return of touch sensation, proprioception
   and nociception began 10 days after the injury. To our knowledge, this
   is the first case report of carotid artery dissection associated with
   airbag deployment. Forced neck extension in such settings may result in
   carotid artery dissection because of shear force injury at the junction
   of the extracranial and intrapetrous segments of the vessel. Clinicians
   should consider carotid artery injury when deterioration in neurological
   status occurs after airbag deployment, We propose that the risk of
   carotid artery dissection was increased by the presence of fibromuscular
   dysplasia.}},

   Design: Prospective, cross-sectional study open to medication and
   blinded to biochemical analyses. Participants: Healthy control subjects
   (n = 24) and 46 inpatients and outpatients meeting the DSM-IV criteria
   for schizophrenia; 20 were being treated with clozapine and 26 were
   taking typical antipsychotic drugs. Interventions: All psychotropic
   drugs other than clozapine or typical antipsychotic drugs were
   discontinued for at least 5 days and subjects fasted overnight before
   they were assessed. Outcome measures: Coccaro Impulsivity Scale scores,
   plasma 5-HT levels, 5-HIAA levels and 5-HT turnover. Results: Patients
   treated with clozapine and : those treated with typical antipsychotics
   had significantly higher impulsivity scores than the control group, and
   the mean impulsivity score of the typical antipsychotic group was
   significantly higher than that of patients treated with clozapine. The
   mean concentration of 5-HT of the typical antipsychotic group was
   significantly lower than that of the control group and patients treated
   with clozapine; however, mean plasma levels of 5-HIAA were significantly
   higher for the clozapine group than the other 2 groups. 5-HT turnover
   was significantly higher for the 2 drug-treatment groups than for the
   control group. Conclusions: These results suggest that treatment with
   clozapine should be considered for patients with schizophrenia who are
   impulsive and aggressive.}},

Abstract = {{This paper offers an antiessentialist, psychoanalytic account of gender
   by arguing against Butler's deconstructive critique of gender
   essentialism. We develop an alternative to Butler's conception of gender
   as performative by focusing on those aspects of gender that resist
   meaning and representation. Using Lacan's concept of the real, we argue
   that any viable theory of gender must account for the limit conditions
   of cultural discourses that constitute subjectivity and sociality. Once
   gender is understood in terms not of proliferating possibilities for
   meaning, but of a certain impossibility of meaning, then gender's
   bearing on human relationality requires reconceptualizing. Claiming that
   various cultural narratives about gender (including traditional
   psychoanalytic narratives) should be recognized as symptomatic attempts
   to come to terms with a fundamental impossibility at the heart of sexual
   difference, we conclude by suggesting ways in which psychoanalysis may
   productively illuminate the failures of meaning that structure human
   relationality.}},

   integration after the first year of clinical function. Implant failure
   can occur for other reasons, with implant fracture being one of the
   major reasons for late failure. The purpose of the present study was to
   determine the incidence of implant fracture in completely edentulous and
   partially edentulous arches and to determine what factors may predispose
   an implant to a higher fracture risk. A retrospective evaluation of
   4,937 implants was performed to determine the incidence of and factors
   common to fractured implants from a sample of implants placed and
   restored in one institutional setting. Based on the results of this
   study, the following observations were made: implants fracture at
   similar rates in the maxilla as in the mandible (0.6\%) implant
   fractures occur more frequently in partially edentulous restorations
   (1.5\%) than in restorations of completely edentulous arches (0.2\%),
   all observed fractures occurred with commercially pure 3.75-mm-diameter
   threaded implants, and prosthetic or abutment screw loosening preceded
   implant fracture for the majority of the implants. More studies would be
   helpful to further explore the relationship and progression of factors
   associated with implant fracture.}},

Abstract = {{Our goal was to determine and predict the effects of temperature, sheer
   rate, hematocrit, and different volume expanders on blood viscosity in
   conditions mimicking deep hypothermia for cardiac operations. Blood was
   obtained from six healthy adults. Dilutions were prepared to hematocrits
   of 35\%, 30\%, 22.5\%, and 15\% using plasma, 0.9\% NaCl, 5\% human
   albumin, and 6\% hydroxyethyl starch. Viscosity was measured over a
   range of shear rates (4.5-450 s(-1)) and temperature (0 degrees-37
   degrees C). A parametric expression for predicting blood viscosity based
   on the study variables was developed, and its agreement with measured
   values tested. Viscosity was higher at low shear rates and low
   temperatures, especially at temperatures less than 15 degrees C (P <
   0.016 for all conditions in comparison with 37 degrees C). Decreasing
   hematocrit, especially to less than 22.5\%, decreased viscosity.
   Hemodilution with albumin or 0.9\% NaCl decreased blood viscosity more
   than hemodilution with plasma or 6\% hydroxyethyl starch (P < 0.01 for
   all cases). The derived mathematical model for viscosity as a function
   of temperature, hematocrit, shear rate, and diluent predicted viscosity
   values that correlated well with the measured values in experimental
   samples (r(2) > 0.92, P < 0.001).}},

   was primarily the nucleation process that was inhibited by the
   {[}(bis)trifluoromethanesulfonate imide] (TFSI) anion. As a corollary,
   the ionic conductivity was strongly dependent on the thermal history of

Abstract = {{Background. Numerous studies have recently been conducted to investigate
   genetic mechanisms in cancer causes and pathogenesis. Some of these
   studies have shown that there were certain specific chromosomal defects
   in normal cells of cancer patients and in their first-degree relatives.
   It was suggested that these individuals were susceptible to cancer
   development when compared with people without these defects.
   Materials and Methods, Chromosomal anomalies, such as gaps, breaks, and
   acentric fragments, and fragile site expression rates were determined in
   peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures in 14 head and neck cancer
   patients, 17 first-degree relatives of these patients, and 20 healthy
   individuals as a control group in this study. RPMI 1640 medium, composed
   of aphidicolin, 5-bromodeoxyuridine, and caffeine were used for the
   induction of fragile sites.
   Results. In cytogenetic and statistical evaluation, it was observed that
   both chromosomal aberration rates and fragile site expression
   frequencies in head and neck cancer patients and in their first-degree
   relatives were significantly greater than the control group (p < .05).
   It was found that fragile site expression was site specific in head and
   neck cancer patients and in their first-degree relatives. These specific
   sites were determined to be 1p21-22, 1q21, 1q25, 2q21, 2q31-33, 3p14,
   16q22-23, 18q21, and 22q12 sites.
   Conclusions. These findings support studies showing that the fragile
   sites might be unstable factors in human genomes and their expression
   could be affected by some genetic factors, such as tumor suppressor
   genes acid mismatch repair genes, and by some environmental factors,
   such as benzo (a) pyrene, dimethylnitrosamine, and dimethylsulfate. In
   conclusion, fragile sites may be playing an important role in the
   genetic tendency to head and neck cancer. Overexpression of these sites
   in normal lymphocytes may be used as a reliable marker to determine the
   genetic susceptibility in head and neck cancer patients and in their
   first-degree relatives. (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The cell surface of the surface layer (S-layer)-carrying strain of
   Bacillus stearothermophilus ATCC 12980 is completely covered with an
   oblique lattice composed of the S-layer protein SbsC. In the
   S-layer-deficient strain, the S-layer gene sbsC was still present but
   was interrupted by a novel type of insertion sequence (IS) element
   designated ISBst12. The insertion site was found to be located within
   the coding region of the sbsC gene, 199 bp downstream from the
   translation start of SbsC. ISBst12 is 1612 bp long, bounded by 16 bp
   imperfect inverted repeats and flanked by a directly repeated 8 bp
   target sequence. ISBst12 contains an ORF of 1446 bp and is predicted to
   encode a putative transposase of 482 aa with a calculated theoretical
   molecular mass of 55 562 Da and an isoelectric point of 9.13. The
   putative transposase does not exhibit a typical DDE motif but displays a
   His-Arg-Tyr triad characteristic of the active site of integrases from
   the bacteriophage lambda Int family. Furthermore, two overlapping
   leucine-ripper motifs were identified at the N-terminal part of the
   putative transposase. As revealed by Southern blotting, ISBst12 was
   present in multiple copies in the Slayer-deficient strain as well as in
   the S-layer-carrying strain. Northern blotting indicated that S-layer
   gene expression is already inhibited at the transcriptional level, since
   no sbsC-specific transcript could be identified in the S-layer-deficient
   strain. By using PCR, ISBst12 was also detected in B. stearothermophilus
   PV72/p6, in its oxygen-induced strain variant PV72/p2 and in the
   S-layer-deficient strain PV72/T5.}},

   The maltase activity is maximal in the distal half of jejunum, while

   of lactase, as well as of other disaccharidases, is maximal in jejunum;

   maximal in jejunum in the one-day old piglings. With age it decreases,
   and its distribution along the small intestine becomes more uniform.
   Activity of these membrane enzymes is low in colon of piglings of all

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: This prospective study was conducted to gain experience as
   to whether it is technically possible to produce autologous RBCs in
   additive solution from cord blood (CB), to optimize the blood supply for
   preterm infants.
   STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: CB was collected from 47 infants with a mean
   (+/- SD) birth weight of 1717 (+/- 699) g. Whenever possible, RBC
   components were prepared by standard centrifugation using a six-bag
   system. Ail samples were put in sterility testing quarantine for 5 days,
   and a maximum storage of 14 days from collection to transfusion was
   specified. The babies were given either the autologous RBCs or standard
   allogeneic RBC concentrates, ii autologous blood was not available.
   RESULTS: In 81 percent of the samples, autologous RBC components could
   be processed (vol, 7-87 mt; Hct, 31-82\%). But within the group of
   extremely low birth weight infants (body weight <1000 g), a mean CB net
   volume of only 37 mt was collected, and the RBC preparation was
   successful only in exceptional cases. Three CB samples (8.6\%) tested
   positive in sterility testing. Of the 47 infants, 21 were treated with a
   total of 62 allogeneic and 4 autologous RBC transfusions. Most infants
   with a body weight over 1400 g did not need any RBC transfusion.
   CONCLUSION: The preparation of autologous RBCs from the CB of preterm
   infants is technically possible in principle. However, major concerns
   must be raised as to whether such preparations are of benefit in
   ensuring safe care of neonates with blood components, with respect to
   the high rate of bacterial contamination and the limited availability in
   babies with low birth weight.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to examine the moderating role of
   individual differences in negative emotionality in the relations of
   behavioral and attentional (emotional) regulation to externalizing
   problem behaviors. Teachers' and one parent's reports of children's
   regulation (attentional and behavioral), emotionality, and problem
   behavior were obtained when children were in kindergarten to grade 3 and
   two years later (N = 169; 146 in major analyses); children's behavioral
   regulation also was assessed with a measure of persistence. According to
   the best fitting structural equation model, at two ages behavioral
   dysregulation predicted externalizing behavior problems for children
   both high and low in negative emotionality, whereas prediction of
   problem behavior from attentional control was significant only for
   children prone to negative emotionality. There were unique, additive
   effects of behavioral and attentional regulation for predicting problem
   behavior as well as moderating effects of negative emotionality for
   attentional regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Aquaculture is considered as a viable source for providing high quality
   and cheap protein, particularly for developing countries with protein
   shortages. However, due to its complexities, aquaculture development
   planning can be difficult without the aid of modern decision-making
   technologies such as decision support systems (DSS). DSS are widely used
   in the business and manufacturing sectors, but their use in agriculture
   is limited and in aquaculture is almost nonexistent. This paper presents
   the design and implementation of an aquacultural development decision
   support system (ADDSS) that would systematically aid the planner in
   making choices regarding the development planning of the aquaculture
   industry for a given region. The system is composed of three main
   components: a model base containing all relevant models which are
   essentially multiple objective in nature, a database containing all
   relevant data, and a dialog component providing a user interface to the
   other two components of the system. The application of ADDSS is
   demonstrated through a case study from Northern Egypt where aquaculture
   appears as a viable industry for supplying cheap and good duality
   protein, balancing the foreign exchange deficits, improving the standard
   of living, and creating employment opportunities. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The gene encoding heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) G recently has
   been mapped to the X chromosome. All mammals have a Y chromosome-encoded
   homologue of HNRNP G called RBMY, which is implicated with a role in
   male fertility and is a candidate for the azoospermia factor gene. We
   have identified a new member of this gene family, HNRNP G-T, and have
   mapped it as a single-copy gene on chromosome 11, This gene contains an
   uninterrupted open reading frame and no introns, consistent with
   derivation from a retroposon, However, unlike many retroposon-derived
   genes, HNRNP G-Tis not a pseudogene. An antiserum raised to the
   conceptual reading frame of HNRNP G-T showed that it encodes a protein
   that is highly expressed in germ cells and in particular in the nuclei
   of meiotic spermatocytes, Surprisingly, although this antiserum was
   raised against human hnRNP G-T protein, it can also detect a similar
   protein in the testis of several mammals. This suggests that the protein
   is highly conserved and that the retrotransposition event generating the
   HNRNP G-T gene predated at least the common ancestor of mouse and man.
   The existence of an additional testis-specific hnRNP a family member
   provides evidence for the importance of these proteins in normal germ
   cell development.}},

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{78}},

Abstract = {{Objective. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility and
   safety of laparoscopic management of obese women with early stage
   endometrial cancer and to compare the surgical outcome, cost, hospital
   stay, recall of postoperative pain control, time to return to full
   activity and to work, and overall satisfaction among these women and
   those managed by laparotomy.
   Methods. We conducted a prospective study over 2 years applying
   laparoscopic surgery to all women with clinical stage I endometrial
   cancer and body mass indices (BMIs) between 28.0 and 60.0 who can
   tolerate such surgery. As a control, we used women with clinical stage I
   endometrial cancer and similar BMIs who underwent laparotomy in the
   previous 2 years. Both groups were compared in their characteristics,
   surgical outcome, cost, and hospital stay, and interviewed regarding
   time to recovery, recall of postoperative pain control, and overall
   satisfaction with their management.
   Results. Forty of 42 obese women who presented with clinical stage I
   endometrial cancer during the study period were offered laparoscopic
   surgery. The procedure was converted to laparotomy in 3 (7.5\%)
   patients. Laparoscopic surgery was thus successful in 88.1\% of all
   obese women. There was no significant difference between women who
   underwent laparoscopy and those who underwent laparotomy in patient
   characteristics, proportion of women who underwent lymphadenectomy,
   complications, total cost, patients' recall of postoperative pain, and
   patients' satisfaction with management. Women who underwent laparoscopy
   had a significantly longer operative time, more pelvic lymph nodes
   removed, a smaller drop in postoperative hematocrit, less pain
   medication, and a shorter hospital stay (194.8 versus 137.7 min, P
   <0.001; 11.3 versus 5.3, P < 0.001; 3.9 versus 5.4, P = 0.029; 32.3
   versus 124.1 mg, P < 0.001; and 2.5 versus 5.6 days, P < 0.001,
   respectively). There was a trend toward earlier resumption of full
   activity and return to work among women who underwent laparoscopy (23.2
   versus 45.0 days, P = 0.073, and 35.3 versus 67.0 days, P = 0.055,
   respectively).
   Conclusions. Most obese women with early stage endometrial cancer can be
   safely managed through laparoscopy with excellent surgical outcome,
   shorter hospitalization, and less postoperative pain than those managed
   through laparotomy. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of early diagenesis on trace element abundance in coral
   skeleton was studied in live coral heads (Porites) from the Nature
   Reserve Reef (NRR), flat, Gulf of Aqaba, northern Red Sea. Petrography
   of the corals shows diagenetic features of dissolution,
   recrystallization, and secondary aragonite precipitation (pore filling),
   which are most extensive in the oldest part of the coral. Coral
   porewaters were extracted with a special setup and were analyzed for
   chemical composition. The total alkalinity and Sr deficit in pore water
   as compared to reef water is consistent with both precipitation of
   secondary aragonite and recrystallization of primary skeleton. The
   present rate constant of pore filling by secondary aragonite was
   estimated by a water replacement experiment to be 0.0015 y(-1), which
   equals to pore filling rate of 1.5 +/- 0.3 kg aragonite per year. The
   corals show clear seasonal fluctuations in Sr/Ca ratios that: are
   interpreted as reflecting changes in sea surface temperature (SST). Yet,
   the secondary aragonite is characterized by a significantly higher Sr/Ca
   ratio than the average ratio in primary aragonite. Thus, measuring a
   mixed sample of pristine and secondary aragonite may produce erroneous
   (about 2 degrees C lower) SST estimates by the Sr/Ca thermometers.
   It appears that the Sr/Ca ratio, a major proxy for paleo-environmental
   marine studies, is sensitive to subtle pore-filling and replacement of
   the original coral matrix by secondary aragonite in the marine
   environment. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

   Prospective study of HIV-infected children (n = 27) shows that, in 8 of

   most striking in 6 of 8 children whose HIV coreceptor tropism changed

Title = {{Impact of endoscopic ultrasound on the management and outcome of

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Although endoscopic ultrasound and endoscopic
   ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration have been shown to aid in the
   diagnosis and staging of pancreatic carcinoma, whether the general use
   of these new techniques impacts the overall management and survival of
   pancreatic cancer, is less clear.
   METHODS: Clinical data on all patients diagnosed with pancreatic
   carcinoma were assessed for two equal time periods during which
   computerized tomography-guided fine needle aspiration and biopsy was
   used (1/93-5/95) and then during which endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine
   needle aspiration was used (8/95-12/97) for the primary diagnosis of
   these patients.
   RESULTS: Comparative data for the computerized tomography era versus the
   endosonography era showed that 1) pancreatic carcinomas diagnosed: 52
   versus 84 patients (stage I-III at diagnosis: 33\% vs 54\%; p < 0.05);
   2) diagnosis by aspiration or biopsy of a pancreatic mass, nodes, liver
   metastasis, or by operation: 46\%, 0\%, 19\%, 29\% versus 52\%, 8\% (p =
   0.02 nodes plus pancreatic masses), 20\%, 7\% (p = 0.002); 3) pancreatic
   resections: 13\% versus 14\%; 4) median survival without liver
   metastases: 102 versus 205 days (p < 0.02, log-rank test). Endoscopic
   ultra sound detected carcinomas that were either not seen or only
   possibly seen by computed tomography in 34\%.
   CONCLUSIONS: More patients (62\%) were diagnosed with pancreatic
   carcinoma when using endoscopic ultrasound and 75\% fewer required
   operations for diagnosis. The 3-month improvement in median survival is
   probably multifactorial but most likely represents lead bias because of
   the greater sensitivity of endoscopic ultrasound for pancreatic
   carcinoma. Using endoscopic ultrasound with endoscopic ultrasound-guided
   fine needle aspiration in patients with pancreatic carcinoma
   significantly affects their management and outcomes. (Am J Gastroenterol

Title = {{Robot hand preshaping and regrasping using genetic algorithms}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{857-874}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This paper contributes (1) to the development of the necessary formalism
   for the generation of task optimal fingertip trajectories for a
   multifingered robot hand of a predetermined preshape closing upon an
   object to be handled; (2) to the generation, in the case of a failing
   grasp, of an optimal sequence of hand preshapes, differing gradually
   from each other in terms of manipulability and stability. A ``look
   ahead{''} preshape control for a robot hand, either in the phase of
   impacting an object with a certain hand preshape or in the regrasp mode,
   necessitates the concept of giving the object the suitable motion
   readiness for a subsequent manipulation behavior; which is a perspective
   missing in the literature. This work provides a formalism for such a
   concept and defines the preshaping and the regrasping efficiencies of a
   robot hand by a performance measure based on both task properties in
   manipulating a grasped object and on object constraints. This measure is
   formulated using the dual criteria of manipulability and stability that
   are derived in terms of vortices, generated by a closing preshape, and
   hand divergences, respectively. These criteria together with candidate
   contact points from possible landing areas on an object to be grasped or
   to be regrasped are then applied to the generation of candidate grasping
   hand configurations or reshaping configurations using the optimal search
   mechanism of genetic algorithms (GA). The surviving configurations at
   the end of each generation, created by the GA-based processing,
   constitute, with optimal performance, the hand posture sequences closing
   on an object in a preshaped manner. This work also contributes to the
   increase in the performance of GAs applied to the generation of optimal
   hand preshapes, by modifying the classical GA operators and by
   introducing more disruptive effects to the directed search mechanism.
   These modifications are tested and sample results are provided and
   discussed in the paper.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose-Secondary prevention trials do not distinguish
   outcomes according to stroke cause. The purpose of the study was to
   determine whether trial efficacy of anticoagulation for secondary
   prevention could be replicated in clinical practice in strokes of
   different etiology.
   Methods-A 2-year observation study was undertaken in 288 stroke patients
   with atrial fibrillation (mean age 76 years; 55\% women) who were
   receiving anticoagulation therapy to maintain an international
   normalized ratio of 2.0 to 3.0. Comparisons were made of(1) patient
   characteristics, anticoagulation control, and annual stroke/hemorrhage
   rates with those of the European Atrial Fibrillation Trial and (2) cause
   of recurrent stroke by initial stroke subtype.
   Results-Subjects were 5 years older (95\% CI 3 to 7 years), and more
   patients had small-vessel stroke (26\% versus 14\%; 95\% CI 3\% to 17\%)
   compared with corresponding trial data. The duration spent in the target
   anticoagulation range (55\% versus 59\%), recurrent stroke rate (5.1\%
   versus 3.6\% per year), and major (2.3\% versus 2.2\% per year) or minor
   (9.5\% versus 11.8\% per year) hemorrhage races were comparable with
   those in patients receiving warfarin in the randomized study. Ten of 14
   (71\%) of embolic recurrences occurred in patients with a previous
   cardioembolic episode, and 8 of 11 (73\%) lacunar recurrences occurred
   in patients with previous lacunar stroke as the qualifying event for
   anticoagulation (P=0.025). Only 3 of 14 cardioembolic compared with 8 of
   11 lacunar recurrences occurred during adequate anticoagulation.
   Conclusions-Anticoagulation for secondary stroke prevention in clinical
   practice achieves outcomes comparable with those of randomized trials.
   Nearly 26\% of qualifying strokes and 40\% of recurrences were
   nonembolic; stroke subtype should be considered when making treatment
   decisions.}},

Abstract = {{PP2A is a central regulator of eukaryotic signal transduction. The human
   catalytic subunit PP2Ac alpha functionally replaces die endogenous yeast
   enzyme, Pph22p, indicating a conservation of function in vivo.
   Therefore, yeast cells were employed to explore the role of invariant
   PP2Ac residues. The PPPAc alpha Y127N substitution abolished essential
   PP2Ac function in vivo and impaired catalysis severely in vitro,
   consistent with the prediction from structural studies that Tyr-127
   mediates substrate binding and its side chain interacts with the key
   active site residues His-118 and Asp-88. The V159E substitution
   similarly impaired PP2Ac alpha catalysis profoundly and may cause global
   disruption of the active site. Two conditional mutations in the yeast
   Pph22p protein, F232S and P240H, were found to cause
   temperature-sensitive impairment of PP2Ac catalytic function in vitro.
   Thus, the mitotic and cell lysis defects conferred by these mutations
   result from a loss of PP2Ac enzyme activity. Substitution of the PP2Ac
   alpha C-terminal Tyr-307 residue by phenylalanine impaired protein
   function, whereas the Y307D and T304D substitutions abolished essential
   function in vivo. Nevertheless, Y307D did not reduce PP2Ac alpha
   catalytic activity significantly in vitro, consistent with an important
   role for the C terminus in mediating essential protein-protein
   interactions. Our results identify key residues important for PP2Ac
   function and characterize new reagents for the study of PP2A in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Standard approaches for computing population exposures due to specific
   sources of air pollutants are relatively complex. In many cases, more
   simple and approximate methods would be useful. This paper develops an
   approach, based on the concept of exposure efficiency, that may be used
   for estimating the impact of a source (or source class) on the
   integrated population exposure. The approach is illustrated by an
   example, which uses the concept of exposure efficiency to examine the
   impact of perchloroethylene emissions from dry cleaners in the United
   States. The paper explores the geographic variability of exposure
   efficiency by evaluating it for each of 100 randomly selected dry
   cleaners. For perchloroethylene, which has a long atmospheric residence
   time, the site-to-site variability in exposure efficiency is found to be
   relatively small. This suggests that simple exposure assessments, based
   on generic distributional characterizations of exposure efficiency, may
   be used in risk assessments without introducing appreciable uncertainty.
   For many compounds, like perchloroethylene, the uncertainty inherent in
   the estimation of cancer potency or source emissions would dominate
   these small errors.}},

Abstract = {{If X is a symmetric Levy process on the line, then there exists a
   non-decreasing, cadlag process H such that X(H(x)) = x: for all x
   greater than or equal to 0 if and only if X is recurrent and has a
   non-trivial Gaussian component. The minimal such H is a subordinator K.
   The law of K is identified and shown to be the same as that of a linear
   time change of the inverse local time at 0 of X. When X is Brownian
   motion, K is just the usual ladder times process and this result extends
   the classical result of Levy that the maximum process has the same law
   as the local time at 0. Write G(1) for last point in the range of K
   prior to t. In a parallel with classical fluctuation theory, the process
   Z := (X-t - X-Gt)(t greater than or equal to 0) is Markov with local
   time at 0 given by (X-Gt)(t greater than or equal to 0). The transition
   kernel and excursion measure of Z are identified. A similar programme is
   outlined for Levy processes on the circle. This leads to the
   construction of a stopping time such that the stopped local times
   constitute a stationary process indexed by the circle.}},

   fan-shaped. The classical Wilks theorem corresponds to the situations in
   which the likelihood contour sets are ellipsoidal. This provides a
   geometric understanding and a useful extension of the likelihood ratio
   theory. As a result, even if the MLEs are not asymptotically normal, the
   likelihood ratio statistics can still be asymptotically chi-square
   distributed. Our technical arguments are simple and easily understood.}},

   recognize specific MHC class I molecules on target cells and prevent the

   introducing a free cysteine at the C-terminal stem region of the

Abstract = {{This study included 87 consecutive patients with unexplained syncope or
   pre-syncope who had undergone the head-up tilt (HUT) test with
   concomitant isoproterenol infusion. A positive response was defined as
   development of syncope or pre-syncope in association with substantial
   hypotension (decline of systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to
   20 mmHg). Coronary artery spasm was suggested from the clinical symptoms
   and electrocardiographic findings in 1 patient (1 / 87 = 1.1\%).
   Intolerance to isoproterenol infusion was noted in 8 cases (8 / 87 =
   9\%). Of the 78 patients who completed the study, 73 showed positive
   responses (73 / 78 = 94\%). (baseline systolic blood pressure = 125 +/-
   23 mmHg vs endpoint systolic blood pressure = 76 +/- 11 mmHg, p < 0.05;
   baseline heart rate = 73 +/- 14 beats per minute vs endpoint HR = 80 +/-
   24 beats per minute, p < 0.05). In 73 patients who showed positive
   responses, the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (WR)
   returned to a safe level at 2 minutes when the patients were returned to
   a supine position (post-study 2 minutes SBP = 124 +/- 18 mmHg vs
   baseline SBP = 125 +/- 23 mmHg, p = NS; post-study 2 minutes HR = 82 +/-
   18 beats per minute vs baseline HR = 73 +/- 14 brats per minute, p <
   0.05). All 73 patients with a positive HUT test received Atenolol
   therapy (50 mg daily). Only 35 of these 73 patients took Atenolol
   regularly and had a repeat HUT test. After atenolol therapy, persistent
   positive responses were observed in 19 cases (19 / 35 = 54\%) and
   negative responses were noted in 16 cases (16 / 35 = 46\%). The mean
   dosage of isoproterenol needed to provoke a positive HUT test in 19
   patients who had received Atenolol therapy and had a positive repeat HUT
   test was 2.3 +/- 1.2 <mu>g / min at baseline and 3.5 +/- 0.9 mug / min
   for post-Atenolol therapy (p < 0.001). Sixteen patients with a negative
   repeat T-TUT test were treated continuously with Atenolol and followed
   for a mean period of 13 +/- 11 months (range, 1-34 months). All 16
   patients were free of syncope or pre-syncope during the period of follow
   up. In conclusion, the HUT test is mostly well tolerated and safe, even
   though the test has a low rate of adverse effects. Atenolol is effective
   for the prevention of provoked or spontaneous recurrent syncope or
   pre-syncope.}},

Abstract = {{The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) is an important mechanical
   property for thin film materials. There are several problems that arise
   from the thermal expansion effect; for example, the mismatch of thermal
   expansion between the thin films and the underlying substrate may lead
   to residual stresses in the thin films. On the other hand, the thermal
   expansion effect can be exploited to drive microactuators. The CTEs of
   Al and Ti thin films were determined in the present study using the
   bilayer microcatilever technique. The contribution of this paper is to
   demonstrate the variation of the thin film CTE with the film thickness.
   The CTE of the Al thin film changes from 18.23 x 10(-6)/degrees C to
   29.97 x 10(-6)/degrees C, when the film thickness increases from 0.3 to
   1.7 mu m. The CTE of the Ti thin film changes from 21.21 x
   10(-6)/degrees C to 9.04 x 10(-6)/degrees C, when the film thickness
   increases from 0.1 to 0.3 mu m. Further, the concept that thin film CTE
   may be influenced by the defects in thin film materials is proposed.
   Thus, a desired thin film CTE can be obtained by tuning the film
   thickness as well as the deposition conditions. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Purpose: In an attempt to evaluate the natural history of neonatal
   vesicoureteral reflux, patients with antenatal history of hydronephrosis
   and documented reflux in the first 30 days of life were analyzed.
   Materials and Methods: Between 1993 and 1998, 260 patients with a
   history of antenatal hydronephrosis were referred for evaluation. Of
   these patients 31 were diagnosed with unilateral or bilateral refluxing
   renal units (54 renal units). Patients were treated with a prospective
   plan of observational therapy and prophylactic antibiotics, and
   resolution rate was calculated in patients with adequate followup.
   Reflux grade was correlated with postnatal ultrasonographic findings,
   urinary tract infections and differential renal function. Outcome
   analysis of 34 high grade (III to V) refluxing renal units using the
   Kaplan-Meier survival curves was undertaken with the end point being
   complete resolution or improvement. Three patients with vesicostomy and
   2 who underwent ureteral reimplantation were excluded from analysis.
   Results: Reflux was grade I in 5\% (33\% males), II in 15\% (62\%
   males), III in 32\% (71\% males), IV in 18\% (90\% males) and V in 30\%
   (100\% males) of the patients. Postnatal ultrasound findings correlated
   poorly with the presence and degree of vesicoureteral reflux. Of 17
   patients followed for at least 14 months (average followup 20) there was
   complete resolution in 60\% with grade III, 50\% with grade IV and 28\%
   with grade V reflux. Using the Kaplan-Meier estimate there was a 50\%
   chance of improvement (decrease in reflux grade by at least 2 grades) in
   high grade reflux by age 16 months. Urinary tract infections developed
   in 8 patients (26\%) while on antibiotics. Of 46 renal. units in 23
   patients evaluated with a renal scan before urinary tract infection, 12
   had less than 35\% function.
   Conclusions: A normal postnatal ultrasound should not be a basis for
   excluding the use of cystography. Our Kaplan-Meier estimate shows that
   high grade reflux does improve and may resolve spontaneously. In
   addition, renal scarring may be seen with high and low grade reflux in
   the absence of urinary tract infection but high grade reflux is
   associated with a higher incidence of infection.}},

   is not compromised after laparoscopy for colorectal cancer. Furthermore,
   less pain, faster recovery of respiratory parameters, and better
   preservation of cell-mediated immune function have been associated with
   the laparoscopic technique. Laparoscopic surgery for early colorectal

Abstract = {{We present clear experimental evidence that the dissimilar magnetic

   nearest distances are responsible for the behavior of the Curie
   temperature. Both magnitudes increase with increasing the metalloid
   content for Fe-B and remain constant for Fe-P. The results from x-ray
   magnetic circular dichroism reveal that Fe-B behaves as a weak
   ferromagnet in all the composition range while Fe-P evolves from a weak
   to strong ferromagnetism character when P concentration increases. This
   fact determines the behavior of the magnetic moment with increasing
   metalloid content that displays a large decrease for Fe-P and a

Abstract = {{A longitudinal study was performed to investigate the content of human
   colostrum and milk of antibodies against endotoxins of Escherichia coli,
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella minnesota during the first 6 mo of
   lactation. The influence of the gestational age of the newborn and the
   prevalence of a systemic infection in the child on maternal antibody
   production were observed. Colostrum of mothers of term infants who had
   shown signs of systemic infection contained higher antibody
   concentrations compared to colostrum of mothers of healthy newborns.
   After the first week post partum, no difference in the milk's antibody
   content could be observed between these two groups. Antibody titres rose
   from 2 wk to 6 mo post partum (p < 0.001). Milk of mothers of preterm
   infants with signs of systemic infection contained higher antibody
   titres than milk of mothers of preterm infants without infection
   throughout the observation period. This difference reached statistical
   significance 3 wk after delivery (p < 0.05). The corrected endotoxin
   antibody levels against all tested antigens in milk of mothers of
   preterm infants with infection 6 mo post partum were 6 +/- 3.5 times as
   high as 2 wk post partum.
   Conclusions: Breast milk contains anti-endotoxin antibodies. The
   particularly high levels of anti-endotoxin antibodies in cases of
   neonatal infection may present a special maternal protection for
   premature infants.}},

Abstract = {{The molecular examination of pathologically altered cells and tissues at
   the DNA, RNA, and protein level has revolutionised research and
   diagnostics in pathology. However, the inherent heterogeneity of primary
   tissues with an admixture of various reactive cell populations can
   affect the outcome and interpretation of molecular studies. Recently,
   microdissection of tissue sections and cytological preparations has been
   used increasingly for the isolation of homogeneous, morphologically
   identified cell populations, thus overcoming the obstacle of tissue
   complexity. In conjunction with sensitive analytical techniques, such as
   the polymerase chain reaction, microdissection allows precise in vivo
   examination of cell populations, such as carcinoma in situ or the
   malignant cells of Hodgkin's disease, which are otherwise inaccessible
   for conventional molecular studies. However, most microdissection
   techniques are very time consuming and require a high degree of manual
   dexterity, which limits their practical use. Laser capture
   microdissection (LCM), a novel technique developed at the National
   Cancer Institute, is an important advance in terms of speed, ease of
   use, and versatility of microdissection. LCM is based on the adherence
   of visually selected cells to a thermoplastic membrane, which overlies
   the dehydrated tissue section and is focally melted by triggering of a
   low energy infrared laser pulse. The melted membrane forms a composite
   with the selected tissue area, which can be removed by simple lifting of
   the membrane. LCM can be applied to a wide range of cell and tissue
   preparations including paraffin wax embedded material. The use of
   immunohistochemical stains allows the selection of cells according to
   phenotypic and functional characteristics. Depending on the starting
   material, DNA, good quality mRNA, and proteins can be extracted
   successfully from captured tissue fragments, down to the single cell
   level. In combination with techniques Like expression library
   construction, cDNA array hybridisation and differential display, LCM
   will allow the establishment of ``genetic fingerprints{''} of specific
   pathological lesions, especially malignant neoplasms. In addition to the
   identification of new diagnostic and prognostic markers, this approach
   could help in establishing individualised treatments tailored to the
   molecular profile of a tumour. This review provides an overview of the
   technique of LCM, summarises current applications and new methodical
   approaches, and tries to give a perspective on future developments. In
   addition, LCM is compared with other recently developed laser
   microdissection techniques.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a novel method for edge feature detection of
   document images based on wavelet decomposition and reconstruction. By
   applying the wavelet decomposition technique, a document image becomes a
   wavelet representation, i.e. the image is decomposed into a set of
   wavelet approximation coefficients and wavelet detail coefficients.
   Discarding wavelet approximation, the edge extraction is implemented by
   means of the wavelet reconstruction technique. In consideration of the
   mutual frequency, overlapping will occur between wavelet approximation
   and wavelet details, a multiresolution-edge extraction with respect to
   an iterative reconstruction procedure is developed to ameliorate the
   quality of the reconstructed edges in this case. A novel combination of
   this multiresolution-edge results in clear final edges of the document
   images. This multiresolution reconstruction procedure follows a
   coarser-to-finer searching strategy. The edge feature extraction is
   accompanied by an energy distribution estimation from which the levels
   of wavelet decomposition are adaptively controlled. Compared with the
   scheme of wavelet transform, our method does not incur any redundant
   operation. Therefore, the computational time and the memory requirement
   are less than those in wavelet transform.}},

   0.4 kg,ha(1), respectively, at Barton Flats (BF). Deposition of N in
   throughfall in the four transects at CP ranged from 12.1 to 31.7
   kg,ha(1)year(1). Spatial variability was high because of heterogenous
   canopy cover and varying exposure to air pollution. Annual estimated
   stand-level deposition of N and S in fog were 10.9 and 1.9 kg,ha(1),
   respectively, at CP, and 0.6 and 0.2 kg,ha(1), respectively, at BF. We
   estimated that N deposition in fog contributed 35\% of the total annual
   N deposition at CP and 13\% at BF. Analogous values for S were 39\% at
   CP and 26\% at BF. Ammonium deposition in throughfall and fog at CP were
   72 and 122\% as high as NO3- deposition because of elevated NH3

Abstract = {{Peach fruit (Prunus persica L. cv. `Miraflores') harvested at the
   firm-ripe stage, treated or not with 2 g l(-1) iprodione, were cooled or
   not at 1 degrees C and ripened at 15 or 20 degrees C and 95\% RH for 10
   days. During ripening, weight loss, fungal development and changes in
   quality parameters (firmness, soluble solids content, titratable
   acidity, pH and ground and flesh color), and carbon dioxide and ethylene
   production were monitored. Cooling alone or combined with iprodione
   avoided Rhizopus nigricans decay during ripening at either ripening
   temperatures. A skin damage not previously reported on fungicide treated
   peach was observed at 20 degrees C. Cooled fruit ripened at 15 degrees C
   showed an anomalous respiration rate and ethylene production after the
   climacteric peak, a loss of firmness and a drop in titratable acidity
   after 7 days of storage, and reduced endo-polygalacturonase activity in
   presence of continuous pectinmethylesterase activity during the first
   week. Cooling before ripening at 20 degrees C led to the best flavor
   without excessive total losses. These results helped in the optimization
   of warming cycles during cold storage used to avoid chilling injuries

Abstract = {{Left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) following acute myocardial
   infarction (AMI), by decreasing renal blood flow, may interfere with
   renal (L)-DOPA availability and, consequently, dopamine synthesis.
   Dopamine of renal origin exerts local natriuretic effects. We studied 17
   post-AMI patients with asymptomatic LVSD (ejection fraction < 40\%) and
   14 without (ejection fraction greater than or equal to 40\%), measuring
   24-h urinary excretions of (L)-DOPA, dopamine and its metabolites, and
   plasma levels of the amines, amine derivatives and type-B natriuretic
   peptide (BNP). Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the
   two groups. No differences were observed in urinary volume and sodium
   and creatinine excretions. The group with asymptomatic LVSD presented
   lower urinary excretion of (L)-DOPA (66.8 +/- 10.1 versus 115.3 +/- 21.9
   nmol,day(-1), P = 0.04), whereas plasma levels of (L)-DOPA were
   identical in both groups. Urinary dopamine was similar in the two groups
   (1124.2 +/- 172.4 versus, 1049.0 +/- 146.4 nmol.day(-1), P = 0.86),
   resulting in higher urinary dopamine/(L)-DOPA ratios in patients with
   asymptomatic LVSD (20.4 +/- 3.0 versus 9.9 +/- 0.8, P < 0.001). Plasma
   levels of BNP were higher in the asymptomatic LVSD group (348.5 +/- 47.3
   versus 146.8 +/- 21.9 pg.ml(-1), P = 0.003). Ejection fraction was
   negatively correlated with both plasma levels of BNP and urinary
   dopamine/L-DOPA ratios. Renal dopamine production is well preserved in
   patients with asymptomatic LVSD and increased neurohumoral activation,
   despite reduced urinary excretion of its precursor. This suggests that
   renal uptake and/or decarboxylation of (L)-DOPA is enhanced in this
   condition, as a compensatory mechanism, contributing to preservation of
   urinary sodium excretion.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The Freiburger Personality Inventory (FPI-R) is a well
   established and proven instrument for the assessment of personality
   traits. Although personality is conceived as a stable trait, clinical
   experience indicates that impressive changes are found on personality
   scales during intensive treatment.
   Method A large sample of inpatients which were treated with
   cognitive-behavioral therapy for bulimia nervosa, tinnitus or anxiety
   disorder was evaluated concerning the question which items of the FPI-R
   were answered differently or identically before and after intensive
   therapy.
   Results: It could be found that items which cover aspects that are
   central to the therapy more often show changing answers. The use of
   conditional form and indefinite frequency adjuncts in the formulation of
   items evidently allowed a more differentiated weighting of pros and cons
   at the end of therapy. Effects of regression to the mean could be
   excluded as an explanation by empirical data.
   Conclusion: It can be concluded that changes in answering items before
   and after intensive therapy can be explained as specific effects of
   therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Background Prospective health impact assessment is a new approach to
   predicting potential health impacts of policies, programmes or projects.
   It has been widely recognized that public policies have important
   impacts on health. In 1997, the Liverpool Public Health Observatory was
   commissioned to carry out a health impact assessment of the Merseyside
   Integrated Transport Strategy (MerlTS). A secondary aim was to pilot a
   method for health impact assessment at the strategic level.
   Methods The methods used drew on previous health impact assessments of
   projects, on strategic environmental assessment, and on policy research.
   They included policy analysis, semi-structured interviews with key
   informants and literature searches.
   Results Four priority impact areas of MerlTS were identified:
   establishing road hierarchies, economic viability, air quality, and
   public transport. Potential health impacts in each of these areas were
   estimated, and recommendations were made to minimize the effects of
   negative impacts and to enhance positive ones.
   Conclusion This health impact assessment prospectively identified the
   key health impacts of a strategy on a defined population and made
   recommendations to maximize potential positive and minimize potential
   negative health impacts. The methods employed are generally applicable
   to prospective health impact assessments of public policies and
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Antenor Firmin published De l'Egalite des Races Humaines in 1885 in
   Paris as a response both to Arthur de Gobineau's racist tome L'Inegalite
   des Races (1853-55) and to the racialist anthropology of the nineteenth
   century. This pioneering work of anthropology has been translated for
   the first time into English by Asselin Charles as The Equality of the
   Human Races (Firmin {[} 1885]2000). In 662 pages of the original text,
   Firmin systematically critiqued the anthropometry and craniometry that
   dominated the anthropology of his day, while he envisioned a broad,
   synthetic discipline that would follow once this narrow approach to the
   study of man was abandoned. He challenged virtually every extant racial
   myth and laid a basis for the understanding of human variation as
   adaptation to climate and environment. Contrary to the polygenist
   doctrines of the infertility of interracial matings, Firmin extolled the
   value of racial mixture, especially in the vigorous New World hybrid
   populations. He developed a critical view of racial classifications and
   of race that foreshadowed much later social constructions of race. In
   the book he also articulated early Pan-Africanist ideas as well as an
   analytical framework for what would become postcolonial studies.
   The Equality of the Human Races is a text that lies historically at the
   foundations of the birth of the discipline of anthropology, yet it is
   unknown to the field. It is a pioneering work in critical anthropology
   that awaits recognition 115 years after it was first published.}},

Abstract = {{The assumptions of declining fertility with rising income and rising

   progress lowers the Smithian equilibrium population, while it raises the

   Smithian equilibrium income, but raises the Malthusian equilibrium
   income. Economic data show strong support for the hypotheses of
   increasing economic returns to population and declining fertility with

Abstract = {{Although the number of centenarians in our population is increasing,
   mortality rates following hip fracture in this group of patients has not

   centenarians with proximal femoral fractures who presented to the
   Derbyshire Royal Infirmary over a 20 year period were retrospectively
   reviewed. The majority of patients were female (M:F 2:11) and had
   suffered intertrochanteric fractures. The recorded incidence of surgical
   complications was low. The mortality at 30 days, 6 months and 1 year
   were 31\%, 50\% and 56\%, respectively representing a 20\% increase in
   mortality at 1 year when compared to the expected mortality rates among

   patients of all ages in previous prospective studies, the centenarians
   in this series were found to have a significantly higher mortality
   during hospital admission (p < 0.001) and at 1 year (p = 0.002). The
   treatment of hip fractures in centenarians poses a challenge. Optimal

   the extracellular spacer and alpha-helical coiled coil domains. These
   sequence polymorphisms are non-conservative and produce distinct
   receptor molecules that differ by four charged residues and alter
   recognition of the receptor by the monoclonal 2F8 antibody. The B6
   SR-AI/II haplotype appears unique, since most inbred strains analyzed
   show tilt: A/J-type haplotype. Interestingly, several of the B6
   polymorphic valiant residues are conserved in human and bovine
   receptors, suggesting a recent divergence of the A/J haplotype. Initial
   studies in CHO-derived cells expressing individual receptor isoforms
   indicate that the A/J and B6 receptors are stable and can mature into
   oligomers expressed in the membrane fractions of these cells. In these
   transfectants, no major functional differences were detected between
   receptors of the two haplotypes with respect to internalization and
   degradation of I-125-labeled acetylated LDL. However, since SR-AI/II
   recognizes a large number of structurally unrelated anionic molecules,
   the possibility that different haplotypes may affect either binding and
   release of other ligands, or receptor recycling, cannot be excluded.}},

Abstract = {{The use of laparoscopic surgery for acute appendicitis (AA) in children
   has increased over recent years. The aim of this study was to determine
   what effect the availability of laparoscopic appendicectomy (LA) has had
   on children admitted with suspected AA. A retrospective review of
   children admitted between January 1994 and June 1999 inclusive who
   underwent appendicectomy for suspected AA was conducted. Data recorded
   included standard demographic information, surgical approach,
   histopathology of the appendix, complications, and post-operative length
   of stay. After LA, children had a shorter post-operative stay, although
   the technique was used less frequently in advanced disease. The rate of
   normal histology was higher for LA. Laparoscopic surgery was performed
   in females in 69\% of whom 48\% had a normal appendix removed. The
   duration of surgery was longer for LA (59 vs 40 min). The rate of LA
   increased to 77\% in the first 6 months of 1999. There was a decrease in
   the proportion of laparoscopic procedures converted to open
   appendicectomy from 50 to 6\% during the period reviewed. The ready
   availability of laparoscopy and increased confidence in its use has
   resulted in more children, especially females, with suspected AA
   undergoing laparoscopy. There was a corresponding higher rate of normal
   appendix removal in this group, but the overall rate of normal histology
   has not changed, suggesting that the laparoscopic approach is more
   likely to be employed where the clinical diagnosis is less certain,
   particularly in older girls.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Most existing large-n cross-sectional analyses of ethnic conflict focus
   on the behavior of the ethnic minority rather than the behavior of the
   state. That is, they tend to attempt to predict or explain the level of
   protest or rebellion in which ethnic minorities engage at the expense of
   determining the causes for the behavior of the government of the state
   in which these minorities live. Previous studies have determined that
   discrimination against minority groups is one of the major causes of
   ethnic protest and rebellion. In addition, much of the literature on
   ethnic conflict does not sufficiently deal with the religious causes of
   that conflict. Accordingly this study focuses on the causes of
   discrimination with a particular emphasis on the religious causes. This
   study analyzes two populations from the Minorities at Risk dataset: the
   105 religiously differentiated minorities and the 163 minorities that
   are not religiously differentiated. The results show that religious
   factors influence the process that leads to discrimination and that the
   causes of religious discrimination are distinct from the causes of other
   types of discrimination. In addition, the dynamics of this process are
   markedly different between the two populations analyzed here. All of
   this, along with other factors, implies that religion is not merely a
   reflection of general cultural differences, but rather has a distinct
   and separate influence on ethnic conflict.}},

Abstract = {{A freeze-drying technique for cutting thin-sections of soft sediments

   structures. Sedimentary processes. which were previously poorly
   documented, have been identified, and others are better understood.
   Spheroidal lens-like pure aggregates of the diatom genus Synedra are
   found in hemipelagic sediments, providing a new insight into their
   traditional paleoecological interpretation. They are possibly related to
   a transportation mechanism from the littoral zone or to lacustrine snow.
   Laminae of Aulacoseira have also been recorded. Evidence of rapid
   sedimentation suggests they are due to massive algal blooms. The
   depositional mechanism that was suggested by other studies for
   explaining the laminations at the Buguldeika uplift is confirmed: the
   hemipelagic sedimentation is interrupted by terrigenous pulses due to
   discharge events. The sedimentation rate appears to be increasing during
   these pulses. Preliminary results from the Academician Ridge show
   stronger microbioturbation during cold periods. This observation
   strengthens the hypothesis of intense water circulation during colder
   times. Thin-section image analysis provides crucial information for

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Recent models have shown that the development of spatial structure in
   plant mixtures may make strong competitive interactions between species
   hard to detect owing to spatial segregation of the competing species.
   Here we address the issue of measuring interspecific competition using a
   simulation based on a neighbourhood population model which assumes that
   both dispersal and competitive interactions are localized. Using known
   parameter combinations we use the model to test the power and efficiency
   of two approaches for detecting and measuring competition. The first
   approach is based on measuring the response of communities to the
   removal of neighbours. Measures of interspecific competition based on
   this approach are extremely biased by spatial segregation of species,
   although this bias may be partially overcome by altering the spatial
   scale at which the effects of removals are recorded. The second approach
   is based on multiple regression of per capita population growth rates on
   local densities of the interacting species. When dispersal is
   restricted, the regression approach provides accurate estimates of
   interspecific competition coefficients when the scale of the sampling
   unit (i.e. the quadrats within which plants are counted) is large
   compared to the scale at which interactions and dispersal occur. When
   seeds disperse globally the removal method performs best; the regression
   method fails because sampling units do not form closed dynamic systems.
   Our results highlight the importance of tailoring methods for detecting
   competition to the characteristics of the species in question. They also
   indicate that rapid nonmanipulative estimates of competition
   coefficients may be the best approach in communities where dispersal is
   restricted and competitive interactions localized, which is likely to be
   the case for the majority of plants.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Hypocalcemia occurring in children with severe primary
   protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) has previously been shown to merely
   reflect a reduction in the protein-bound fraction of serum calcium. On
   the other hand, ultrafilterable, i.e., nonprotein bound calcium (Ca(U)),
   remains unaffected. The aim of the present investigation was to test the
   hypothesis that in infantile PEM, ionized calcium, which represents the
   major and physiologically most important component of Ca,, is also kept
   within a normal concentration, whatever the total serum calcium levels.
   Methods. Three milliliters of peripheral venous blood were obtained on
   admission and periodically afterward from 18 fasting marasmic infants
   and 6 children with the edematous form of PEM (kwashiorkor), Ionized
   calcium was determined in 125 muL aliquots of blood serum with
   ion-selective electrodes. The measurement of related elements and
   molecules was carried out with customary laboratory procedures.
   Results. On admission, as well as during the ensuing stages of
   nutritional recovery, ionized serum calcium exhibited a normal
   concentration, with the exception of two initial samples, Total calcium,
   total protein, albumin, and inorganic phosphate concentrations were
   decreased in a variable degree according to the clinical type, ascending
   to normal levels during recovery.
   Conclusions. Ionized calcium serum concentration remains within normal
   limits in severe infantile PEM. (C) 2001 IMSS, Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Many strains of the important human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes form
   aggregates when grown in vitro in liquid medium. The present studies
   demonstrate that this property is crucial for the adherence, the

   sequence of 19 amino acid residues (designated AHP) was identified in
   surface proteins of common S. pyogenes serotypes. This sequence was
   found to promote bacterial aggregation through homophilic
   protein-protein interactions between AHP-containing surface proteins of
   neighbouring bacteria. A synthetic AHP peptide inhibited S. pyogenes
   aggregation, reduced the survival of S. pyogenes in human blood and
   attenuated its virulence in mice. In contrast, mutant bacteria devoid of
   surface proteins containing AHP-related sequences did not aggregate or
   adhere to epithelial cells. These bacteria are also rapidly killed in
   human blood and show reduced virulence in mice, underlining the
   pathogenic significance of the AHP sequence and S. pyogenes aggregation.}},

Abstract = {{The possible role of four candidate genes in lipid and lipoprotein
   response to diet was examined in 214 members of two large kibbutz
   settlements in Israel. Four site polymorphisms (signal peptide
   insertion/deletion, XbaI, EcoRI and MspI) of the apo B gene, the common
   apo E genotypes, three common mutations (T-93G, S447stop and N291S) of
   the LPL gene and the CETP I405V RFLP were determined. The average
   reduction induced by diet in participants with the absence of the EcoRI
   restriction site (L4154) of the apo B gene compared with those found to
   be homozygotes for the restriction site (G/G4154) were: 16.2 and 8.0
   mg/dl for total cholesterol (TC) (P = 0.01); and 15.6 and 6.2 mg/dl for
   LDL-C (P = 0.007), respectively. TC and LDL-C baseline levels were
   significantly different among the apo-E genotypes, yet there were no
   significant effects on lipid and lipoprotein dietary response.
   Triglyceride baseline values were significantly lower (P = 0.007) among
   subjects with the LPL S447stop mutation and HDL-C was significantly
   lower (P=0.008) among subjects found to be heterozygous for the LPL
   N291S mutation. A heterogeneous response for triglyceride was observed
   for individuals with the S291 allele as compared to those individuals
   who were found to be homozygous for the N291 allele. No differences in
   dietary responsiveness were observed among the apo E and CETP genotypes.
   In conclusion, our results suggest that sequence variation(s) in the
   coding region of the apo B gene linked to the EcoRI polymorphism are
   associated with total cholesterol and LDL-C responsiveness to dietary
   manipulation. In our study population, LPL mutations had a significant
   effect on TG and HDL-C baseline levels and on their response to diet.

Abstract = {{Background: Increasing the appropriateness of use of upper
   gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is important to improve quality of care
   while at the same time containing costs. This study explored whether
   detailed explicit appropriateness criteria significantly improve the
   diagnostic yield of upper GI endoscopy.
   Methods: Consecutive patients referred for upper GI endoscopy at 6
   centers (1 university hospital, 2 district hospitals, 3 gastroenterology
   practices) were prospectively included over a 6-month period. After
   controlling for disease presentation and patient characteristics, the
   relationship between the appropriateness of upper GI endoscopoy, as
   assessed by explicit Swiss criteria developed by the RAND/UCLA panel
   method, and the presence of relevant endoscopic lesions was analyzed.
   Results: A total of 2088 patients (60\% outpatients, 57\% men) were
   included. Analysis was restricted to the 1681 patients referred for
   diagnostic upper GI endoscopy. Forty-six percent of upper GI endoscopies
   were judged to be appropriate, 15\% uncertain, and 39\% inappropriate by
   the explicit criteria. No cancer was found in upper GI endoscopies
   judged to be inappropriate. Upper GI endoscopies judged appropriate or
   uncertain yielded significantly more relevant lesions (60\%) than did
   those judged to be inappropriate (37\%; odds ratio 2.6: 95\% Cl {[}2.2,
   3.2]). in multivariate analyses, the diagnostic yield of upper GI
   endoscopy was significantly influenced by appropriateness, patient
   gender and age, treatment setting, and symptoms.
   Conclusions: Upper GI endoscopies performed for appropriate indications
   resulted in detecting significantly more clinically relevant lesions
   than did those performed for inappropriate indications. In addition, no
   upper GI endoscopy that resulted in a diagnosis of cancer was judged to
   be inappropriate. The use of such criteria improves patient selection
   for upper GI endoscopy and can thus contribute to efforts aimed at
   enhancing the quality and efficiency of care.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Intraligamentary (periodontal ligament) injection has been
   used to locally control pain with minimal anesthetic dose. The purpose
   of the present study was to determine the histologic effect of using a
   computer-controlled local anesthesia delivery system (CCLADS) for the
   administration of a periodontal ligament injection in the mini-swine
   model system.
   Methods: Thirty-two sites in 3 mini-swine pigs with healthy periodontium
   were selected. Each site was notched on the mesial-lingual line angle of
   the tooth to allow a reference for needle placement and provide a
   histologic marker. An anesthetic cartridge was used with a 30-gauge
   needle attached to the handpiece of the CCLADS. This provided a
   controlled flow rate for 2 minutes. The control sites were treated with
   the same needle in place for 20 seconds. The animals were sacrificed and
   provided observation periods of 1 hour, 1, 4, 7, 21, and 49 days.
   Specimens were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and trichrome.
   Results: Twenty-four hours after injection, limited localized
   inflammation was present. By 7 days, the ligament appeared within normal
   limits. Apical migration of the junctional epithelium extended to the
   apical limit of the notch and was similar in test and control specimens.
   Conclusions: Within the limits of this study, the histologic results
   showed that tissue responses following intraligament injections using a
   CCLADS demonstrated limited inflammatory responses within the first 24
   hours, which abated by 7 days postinjection. Similar migration of the
   junctional epithelium was seen in test and control specimens and was
   probably related to tooth injury rather than anesthetic injections.
   Further investigations are warranted using CCLADS to determine whether
   clinical benefits will translate in the human model system.}},

Abstract = {{Tsunami have probably deposited sand sheets that are intercalated in
   Holocene hay-door mud exposed on the Boso and Miura Peninsulas, facing
   the convergent boundary of the Pacific, Philippine Sea, and Eurasian
   Plates. We have identified seven sand sheets at four drowned valleys,
   and correlated these by 137 radiocarbon dates of shells and wood. The
   sheets consist of poorly sorted muddy sand and well-sorted sand layers
   in fining upward sequences, containing abundant transported shells,
   rip-np clasts and wood fragments. The sheets erosionally overlie
   bioturbated bay-floor mud that contains molluscan shells in life
   position. Most of the sheets are less than 20 cm thick and rarely more
   than 50 cm thick. Some molluscan shells are older in these layers than
   in underlying mud. Both landward and seaward paleocurrents are shown in
   a few cases by imbrication of shells and by low-angle wedge shaped
   lamination. At least five of the sand sheets contain molluscan fossils
   derived from rocky coasts or shore platforms, although they intercalated
   in mud deposited within bays, at depths of 10-15 m. Two other sand
   sheets are dominated by open seashore ostracode assemblages, although
   they were deposited in the brackish inner bay and muddy central bay.
   Five of the layers may correlate with emergences recorded by nearby
   Holocene marine terraces. These correlations suggest that great
   earthquakes triggered the inferred tsunami. The tsunami occurred at
   intervals of 300-2000 years beginning about 10,000 years ago. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Moyamoya disease is a specific chronic cerebrovascular occlusive disease
   first reported by Japanese surgeons in 1957. The disease is
   characterized by stenosis or occlusion of the terminal portions of the
   bilateral internal carotid arteries and abnormal vascular network in the
   vicinity of the arterial occlusion. It may cause ischemic attacks or
   cerebral infarction, which is more frequent in children than in adults.
   In adults, cerebral hemorrhage may occur. The disease is distributed in
   all age groups, but the highest peak is in childhood at less than 10
   years of age. The characteristic histopathologic features of the
   steno-occlusive arteries are fibrocellular thickening of the intima
   containing proliferated smooth muscle cells and prominently tortuous and
   often duplicated internal elastic lamina. There is usually no
   atheromatous plaque in the arterial wall. Etiology of the disease is
   still unknown; however, multifactorial inheritance is considered
   possible because of a higher incidence of the disease in Japanese and
   Koreans and approximately 10\% of familial occurrence among the
   Japanese. Recent genetic studies suggest some responsible genetic foci
   in chromosomes 3, 6 and 17.}},

   effect of heating rate on the gelling characteristics of curdlan aqueous
   dispersions. Thermal scanning rheological measurements showed that the
   final dynamic storage modulus (G') of the dispersion after heating to 90
   degrees C and subsequent cooling to 30 degrees C increased with rising
   heating rate, while the final dynamic mechanical loss tangent (tan
   delta) decreased. This was attributed predominantly to the increase in
   thermo-reversible component or the number of junction zones between
   curdlan molecules accomplished with hydrogen bonds in the gelled system.
   The measurements also indicated that the final G' of the dispersion
   decreased with increasing incubation time at 55 degrees C, while the
   final tan delta increased. These results suggested that the behavior of
   curdlan within its swelling temperature range should play an important
   role in the gelation and that heating history should determine the
   number of junction zones in the gel and/or the amount of total bonding
   energy stored there. These suggestions were supported by a difference in
   the gelling characteristics between alkali-neutralized dispersion (i.e.
   dissolving curdlan particles in an alkaline solution beforehand) and
   water dispersion; the final G' for the former was larger than that for
   the latter after the heating and cooling process, while the final tan
   delta for the former was smaller. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Background: The aim of this study was to determine the role of anal
   vector manometry in the assessment of postpartum anal sphincter injury
   and to establish the most suitable method of anal vector volume analysis
   for identifying significant external anal sphincter (EAS) injury in an
   at-risk parous population.
   Methods: A total of 101 consecutive women with a history of instrumental
   or traumatic vaginal delivery was recruited. Anal ultrasonography and
   anal vector manometry were performed. Receiver-operator characteristic
   curves were used to determine the usefulness of anal manometry and anal
   vector volume analysis in the identification of significant EAS
   disruption (full thickness, more than one quadrant involved) detected by
   ultrasonography.
   Results: Seventeen women had significant EAS disruption identified by
   anal ultrasonography. Anal vector manometry provided complementary
   functional information. Anal vector symmetry index (VSI), determined by
   analysis of mean maximum squeeze pressure, yielded 100 per cent
   sensitivity for significant EAS disruption, with a positive predictive
   value of 61 per cent.
   Conclusion: Anal vector manometry complements endoanal ultrasonography.
   VSI, determined by means of the squeeze pressure profile, correlates
   best with significant EAS disruption identified at anal ultrasonography.}},

Abstract = {{We perform a model-independent analysis so as to constrain the
   leptoquark (LQ) models from negative searches for mu-->e gamma, mu-->3e
   decays (and analogous processes in the tau sector), and coherent mu-e
   conversion in nuclei. We considerably improve some constraints obtained
   by analyses known in the literature, analyses which we show have by far
   underestimated the LQ contributions to the mu-->3e. In particular we
   find that the coherent mu-e conversion in nuclei mediated by the
   photon-conversion mechanism and the mu-->3e decay are golden plates
   where the flavor-changing leptoquark couplings, involving the second and
   third quark generations, can be strongly constrained. This is due to the
   fact that these processes Set the enhancements by large
   log(m(q)(2)/m(LQ)(2)) terms which are induced by the so-called
   ``photon-penguin{''} diagrams. These enhancements, which produce a mild
   Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani (GIM) suppression in the amplitudes, have not
   been taken into account in the previous analyses. We show that the
   mu-->e gamma decay can set weaker constraints on the LQ models and this
   is because its amplitude is strongly GIM suppressed by the terms of
   order O(m(q)(2)/m(LQ)(2)). We also present the results for the
   corresponding constraints in the tau sector. Finally, the prospects of
   the future muon experiments for the improvement of the present bounds
   are analyzed and discussed.}},

   Subjects: MC3T3-E1 mouse osteoblasts.
   Interventions: Cells were irradiated at 0, 2, 4, or 6 Gy. Specimens were
   harvested at 1, 7, 14, 28, and 42 days following irradiation for
   immunohistochemical analysis of transforming growth factor beta(1)

Abstract = {{Chemical soil disinfestation often leads to the eradication of most
   microbial residents. This creates a microbial vacuum, which often leads
   to a rebounding of pathogens. This in turn may cause even more damage
   than those originally targeted for control. Soils, especially those with
   low microbial populations are more vulnerable to pathogen reinvasion
   following fumigation. A non-chemical approach to improve the control of
   soilborne pests involves combining organic amendments with soil
   solarization. Heating soils, that have been covered with plastic film
   and amended with suitable organic materials, actuates a chain reaction
   of chemical and microbial degradation, which leads to the generation of
   toxic compounds in vapor and liquid phases in the soil. The generation
   of toxic compounds increases with temperature. These compounds
   accumulate under the plastic mulch, and enhance toxicity against soil
   flora and fauna, especially soilborne plant pathogens. The plastic mulch
   traps the volatile compounds and creates an atmosphere in the soil that
   enhances degradation of the organic matter. The toxicity of the
   generated volatile compounds is expected to be higher at the high soil
   temperature prevailing during solarization. At the end of the process,
   the soil contains less pathogens, and different microflora, which may
   suppress reestablishment of pathogens in the soil. The effect of
   solarizing organically amended soil as a control method was validated
   under commercial field conditions. A long-term effect of the combined
   treatments was also evident. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Purpose: To report our experience with the use of the (Eclipse(R))
   elastomeric pump for ambulatory Patient Controlled Regional Analgesia
   (PCRA)
   Method: After a pilot study using this device in patients admitted to
   the hospital, seven patients received PCRA at home using the elastomeric
   pump. Patients with a variety of continuous regional anesthetic blocks
   were sent home with written and verbal instructions regarding the use of
   this device, boluses, side effects of local anesthetics and removal of
   block catheters. Patients were contacted daily to collect data with
   regards to the efficacy of the block, problems associated with the use
   of this device and their satisfaction with the method of analgesia.
   Results: During the pilot study there were two catheter disconnections
   requiring rescue analgesics. Two patients had the entire contents of the
   bulb delivered over several minutes. Among the seven patients receiving
   PCRA at home, one patient had to be admitted to the hospital. One
   patient had block catheter slip out during transit. The volume delivered
   could not be measured. Patients found it difficult to know if the drug
   had been delivered. Three patients noted that the pumps were empty
   earlier than expected. One patient found it difficult to change the
   bulb. No patient had difficulty with catheter removal or with bolusing.
   Conclusions: PCRA offers excellent postoperative analgesia at home.
   Elastomeric pumps facilitate PCRA but are imprecise with drug delivery
   and may not be safe for epidural infusions. The safety of this device
   for peripheral nerve blocks should be evaluated further.}},

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To evaluate primary care and specialist physicians'
   satisfaction with interphysician communication and to identify the major
   problems in the current referral process.
   DESIGN: Surveys were mailed to providers to determine satisfaction with
   the referral process; then patient-specific surveys were e-mailed to
   this group to obtain real-time referral information.
   SETTING: Academic tertiary care medical center,
   PARTICIPANTS: Attending-level primary care physicians (PCPs) and
   specialists.
   MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The response rate for mail surveys for
   PCPs was 57\% and for specialists was 51\%. In the mail survey, 63\% of
   PCPs and 35\% of specialists were dissatisfied with the current referral
   process. Respondents felt that major problems with the current referral
   system were lack, of timeliness of information and inadequate referral
   letter content. Information considered, important by recipient groups
   was often not included in letters that were sent, The response rate for
   the referral specific e-mail surveys was 56\% for PCPs and 53\% for
   specialists. In this e-mail survey, 68\% of specialists reported that
   they received no information from the PCP prior to specific referral
   visits, and 38\% of these said that this information would have been
   helpful. In addition, four weeks after specific referral visits, 25\% of
   PCPs had still not received any information from specialists.
   CONCLUSIONS: Substantial problems were present in the referral process.
   The major issues were physician dissatisfaction, lack of timeliness, and
   inadequate content of interphysician communication. Information obtained
   from the general survey and referral-specific survey was congruent.
   Efforts to improve the referral system could improve both physician
   satisfaction and quality of patient care.}},

Abstract = {{The copolymer poly(AN-St-MMA) (PASM) was synthesized from acrylonitrile
   (AN), styrene (St) and methyl methacrylate (MMA) by emulsion
   polymerization. The blends were obtained from chlorinated polyethylene
   (CPE) and PASM. The compatibility of the PASM with CPE was estimated by
   the methods of torsional braid analysis (TBA) and scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) after mechanical blending. The results show that the
   MMA has a compatible effect on the blend of the CPE with the copolymer
   PAS formed from AN and St. The MMA-containing ACS resin has a better
   rheological behavior. The apparent viscosity eta(s) in the melt
   decreases with the increasing shear rate, and the melt has a behavior of
   a pseudoplastic liquid. When the content of MMA is about 5\%, the
   viscosity in the melt and flow power n are all the minimum, and they
   increase with an increase of MMA. When the content of AN, St and MMA are
   fixed and the content of CPE is about 25\%, the melt viscosity is the
   lowest. The impact strength increases with an increase of CPE, whereas
   the tensile strength decreases with an increase of CPE. (C) 2000

   proposed an algorithm of finding an element of Clarke generalized

   Ectopic pregnancies and other pregnancy complications at sea can be
   life-threatening events. Data sources included shipboard medical

   Center Hospitalized Pregnancy and Women Aboard Ship studies. The overall
   pregnancy rate was 19 per 100 woman-years (95\% confidence interval,
   18-20), based on the complement of women assigned to participating
   ships. If pregnant women routinely were to remain aboard ships at sea
   during deployments through their first 20 weeks of pregnancy, it is
   expected that approximately 9 ectopic pregnancies and 40 spontaneous

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The many biological, and few psychodynamic explanations of reduplicative
   syndromes tend to have paralleled the dualism of the phenomenon with
   organic theories concentrating on form and dynamic theories emphasising
   content; This paper extends the contribution of psychoanalytic thinking
   to an elucidation of the form of the delusion. Literature on clinical
   and aetiological aspects of reduplicative phenomena is reviewed
   alongside a brief examination of psychoanalytic models not overtly
   related to these phenomena. The human experience of doubles as universal
   archetype is considered. There is an obvious aetiological role for brain
   lesions in delusional misidentifications, but psychological symptoms in
   an individual can rarely be reduced to an organic disorder. The
   splitting and doubling which occurs in the phenomena have resonances in
   cultural mythology and in theories from different schools of
   psychodynamic thought. For the individual patient and doctor, it is a
   diverting bur potentially empty debate to endeavour to draw strict
   divisions between what is physical and what is psychological although
   both need to be investigated. Nevertheless, in patients in whom there is
   clear evidence of an organic contribution to aetiology a psychodynamic
   understanding may serve to illuminate the patient's experience.
   Organic brain disease or serious functional illness predispose to
   regression to earlier modes of archetypical and primitive thinking with
   concretization of the metaphorical and mythological world.
   psychoanalytic models have a contribution in describing the form as well
   as the content of reduplicative phenomena.}},

Abstract = {{The evidence is reviewed that the Broad Line Region (BLR) probably has
   two distinct components located at about the same distance from the
   central black hole. One component, BLR II, is optically-thick,
   low-ionization emission at least some of which arises from a disc and
   the other, BLR I, is probably optically-thin emission from a more
   spherically symmetric halo or atmosphere. The high Fe II/H beta ratios
   seen in Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) are not due to strong Fe
   II emission, as is commonly thought, but to unusually weak Balmer
   emission, probably caused by higher densities. NLS1s probably differ
   from non-NLS1s because of the higher density of gas near the black hole.
   This produces a higher accretion rate, a denser BLR, and a view of the
   central regions that is more face-on. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{This study examined the relative contribution of two aspects of
   pain-related fear to functional disability among 133 persons with
   chronic pain, predominantly chronic back pain: 1) beliefs that pain
   represents damage or significant harm to the body and 2) beliefs that
   activities that cause pain should be avoided. Pain-related fear was
   assessed using the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, Version 2 (TSK-2).
   Factor analysis in the present study replicated the two-factor solution
   found in a previous investigation, representing the two dimensions of
   pain-related fear noted above. Activity avoidance was significantly
   associated with the percent of maximum expected weight lifted from floor
   to waist and waist to shoulder during Progressive Isoinertial Lifting
   Evaluation (PILE). Fear of damage or harm to the body was only
   significantly related to the floor to waist lift When controlling for
   demographic, physiologic, and other psychological variables, only
   activity avoidance continued to significantly predict performance on
   both lifts of the PILE. Although it has been proposed that
   deconditioning may mediate the relationship between activity avoidance
   and disability this was not supported in the present investigation The
   results highlight the importance of pain-related fear; particularly
   activity avoidance, in the assessment of functional activity among

Abstract = {{Nasal respiratory turbinates are complex, epithelially lined structures
   in nearly all birds and mammals that act as intermittent countercurrent
   heat exchangers during routine lung ventilation. This study examined
   avian respiratory turbinate function in five large bird species
   (115-1,900 g) inhabiting mesic temperate climates. Evaporative water
   loss and oxygen consumption rates of birds breathing normally
   (nasopharyngeal breathing) and with nasal turbinates experimentally
   bypassed (oropharyngeal breathing) were measured. Water and heat loss
   rates were calculated from lung tidal volumes and nasal and
   oropharyngeal exhaled air temperatures (T-ex). Resulting data indicate
   that respiratory turbinates are equally adaptive across a range of avian
   orders, regardless of environment, by conserving significant fractions
   of the daily water and heat budget. Nasal T-ex of birds was compared to
   that of lizards, which lack respiratory turbinates. The comparatively
   high nasal T-ex of the lizards in similar ambient conditions suggests
   that their relatively low metabolic rates and correspondingly reduced
   lung ventilation rates may have constrained selection on similar
   respiratory adaptations.}},

Abstract = {{The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gpd) gene promoter was

   isozyme H2 gene in primary metabolic cultures of Phanerochaete
   chrysosporium. The molecular mass, pI, and optical absorption spectra of
   purified recombinant LiPH2 (rLiPH2) were essentially identical to those
   of wild-type LiPH2 (wtLiPH2). wtLiPH2 was prepared by growing cells in
   the absence of Mn-II, conditions under which P. chrysosporium manganese
   peroxidase (MnP) is not expressed, ensuring that wtLiPH2 was not
   contaminated with MnP, The kinetics of veratryl alcohol (VA) oxidation
   were essentially identical for rLiPH2 and wtLiPH2. The rLiPH2, wtLiPH2,
   and wild-type LiP isozyme H8 (wtLiPH8) enzymes were used to reexamine
   previous claims that LiPH2 can oxidize Mn-II at a rate sufficient to
   promote catalytic turnover of the enzyme, Our results demonstrate that
   rLiPH2, wtLiPH2, and LiPH8 do not turn over under steady-state
   conditions, when Mn-II is the sole reducing substrate. Furthermore,
   transient-state kinetic analyses show that the reduction rate of the
   catalytic intermediate, LiP compound I, by VA was at least 2 x
   10(3)-fold higher than the rate of reduction in the presence of Mn-II.
   No reduction of LiP compound II was observed in the presence of Mn-II.
   In contrast to previous claims, these data strongly suggest that Mn-II
   is not a productive substrate for LiPH2 or LiPH8, (C) 2000 Academic

Volume = {{74}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To review the current literature on the role of vascular
   endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor (VEGF/VPF) in
   ovarian physiology and pathology.
   Design: A computerized search was conducted to identify relevant in
   vitro and in vivo studies published in English. MEDLINE, Current
   Contents, and the Index Medicus were searched for studies published
   before January 2000.
   Result(s): VEGF/VPF is an angiogenic factor and a potent mitogen for
   vascular endothelium. During reproductive life, VEGF/VPF plays a role in
   the cyclic growth of ovarian follicles and corpus luteum development and
   maintenance, mediating ovarian angiogenesis. VEGF/VPF expression and
   secretion are induced by both FSH and LH/hCG receptor-activated
   pathways.
   Conclusion(s): VEGF/VPF expression and production within the ovary are
   critical for normal reproductive function. Defects in angiogenesis may
   contribute to a variety of disorders including anovulation and
   infertility, pregnancy loss, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, and
   ovarian neoplasms. (Fertil Steril(R) 2000;74:429-38. (C) 2000 by

Abstract = {{A MEMS-first fabrication process for integrating CMOS circuits with
   polysilicon micromechanical structures is described in detail. The
   overall process uses 18 masks (22 lithography steps) to merge a p-well
   LOGOS CMOS process that has one metal and two polysilicon layers with a
   surface micromachining process that has three layers of polysilicon. The
   microstructures are formed within recesses on the surface of silicon
   wafers such that their uppermost surfaces are coplanar with the
   remainder of the substrate. No special planarization technique, such as
   chemical-mechanical polishing, is used in die work described here.
   Special aspects of the process include provisions to improve lithography
   within the recesses, to protect the microstructures during the circuit
   fabrication, and to implement an effective lead transfer between the
   microstructures and the on-chip circuitry. The process is validated
   using a test vehicle that includes accelerometers and gyroscopes
   interfaced with sensing circuits. Measured transistor parameters match
   those obtained in standard CMOS, with NMOS and PMOS thresholds at 0.76 V
   and -0.96 V, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of dietary supplements of folic acid at 0 (F-) or 15 ppm
   (F+) and of conditioning the uterus (C+) or not (C-) with an
   intrauterine infusion of dead semen on embryonic survival and
   prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)) concentrations in the allantoic fluid on day
   30 of gestation were studied. Sixty-four F-1 crossbred gilts (Yorkshire
   x Landrace) were used in a 2 x 2 factorial design. The initiation of
   folate supplementation and the intrauterine infusion of dead semen were
   done at the estrus preceding the fertile mating. Folate status in serum
   was lower in F+ gilts than in F- gilts during the estrus cycle (folic
   acid x period interaction, P less than or equal to 0.007). Conditioning
   increased ovulation rate in F- gilts while it tended to decrease it in
   F+ gilts (interaction folic acid x conditioning, P less than or equal to
   0.03). A similar interaction (P less than or equal to 0.02) was observed
   on the number of presumably live embryos at 30 d of gestation. Mean
   PGE(2) concentration in the allantoic fluid was not affected by
   treatments (P greater than or equal to 0.44), but the frequency of sows
   having elevated allantoic PGE(2) (> 4 ng mL(-1)) tended to be higher (P
   less than or equal to 0.06) in F+ sows. Overall values of PGE(2) were
   correlated with total litter weight (R-2=0.54). In conclusion, there was
   no synergism between folic acid supplements and conditioning of the
   uterus with dead semen on the reproductive performance or on the
   secretion of allantoic PGE(2) at 30 d of gestation. The secretion of
   allantoic PGE(2) appears as an important factor involved in the control
   of litter size and weight.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a new approach for creating performance control systems for
   digital puppetry. Genetic programming with fitness values specified
   directly by the puppeteer is used. A generic device and model
   representation combined with the inherent domain independence of the
   genetic programming paradigm allows this approach to create control
   systems for arbitrary combinations of input devices and models. In
   addition, a number of unique interaction techniques have been developed
   to support the user-directed search. In this paper we introduce the
   approach, describe the implementation and user interface and present the
   results from a comprehensive evaluation with expert users. We show that
   a search-based approach can provide an effective alternative to manually
   designing performance control systems and an elegant mechanism for
   unifying low-level input devices with a broad range of model control
   modes. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The O-18 content of CO2 is a powerful tracer of photosynthetic activity
   at the ecosystem and global scale. Due to oxygen exchange between CO2
   and O-18-enriched leaf water and retrodiffusion of most of this CO2 back
   to the atmosphere, leaves effectively discriminate against O-18 during
   photosynthesis. Discrimination against O-18 (Delta O-18) is expected to
   be lower in C-4 plants because of low ci and hence low retrodiffusing
   CO2 flux. C-4 plants also generally show lower levels of carbonic
   anhydrase (CA) activities than C-3 plants. Low CA may limit the extent
   of O-18 exchange and further reduce Delta O-18. We investigated CO2-H2O
   isotopic equilibrium in plants with naturally low CA activity, including
   two C-4 (Zea mays, Sorghum bicolor) and one C-3 (Phragmites
   australis)species. The results confirmed experimentally the occurrence
   of low Delta O-18 in C-4, as well as in some C-3, plants. Variations in
   CA activity and in the extent of CO2-H2O isotopic equilibrium (theta
   (eq)) estimated from on-line measurements of Delta O-18 showed large
   range of 0-100\% isotopic equilibrium (theta (eq) = 0-1). This was
   consistent with direct estimates based on assays of CA activity and
   measurements of CO2 concentrations and residence times in the leaves.
   The results demonstrate the potential usefulness of Delta O-18 as
   indicator of CA activity in vivo. Sensitivity tests indicated also that
   the impact of theta (eq) <1 (incomplete isotopic equilibrium),on O-18 of
   atmospheric CO2 can be similar for C-3 and C-4 plants and in both cases
   it increases with natural enrichment of <Delta>O-18 in leaf water.}},

Abstract = {{Eating impairments (dysphagia) in children with cerebral palsy (CP) have
   been well documented. However, individual components of ingestion, such
   as the feeding skills of eating and drinking and their relationship to
   oral-motor planning skills (praxis), remain largely undetermined. The
   purpose of the present study was to examine functional feeding and oral
   praxis skills in a group of children with CP and mild eating impairment
   and to compare their skills with a group of age-matched controls. As
   well, interobserver reliabilities and concurrent validity of these tests
   were examined to determine their reliability and to what extent they may
   be measuring similar constructs. Twenty-seven children with CP and 21
   age-matched controls, aged 4.0-16 years, participated in this study. Two
   oral praxis tests (OFMF and OPT) and two standard ingestive skills tests
   (GVA and FFAm) were administered to each child. Children with CP scored
   consistently and significantly lower on the OFMF than controls (p <
   0.001); similar results were achieved on the OPT (p < 0.001). Children
   with CP had difficulty with items where there was a high demand for
   repetition and smooth sequencing. On the ingestive skills tests children
   with CP took significantly longer for chewing a hard solid food texture
   than controls (p < 0.001), and functional feeding skills were also
   significantly poorer than in controls. Interrater reliability
   coefficients for the OPT and OFMF were excellent (all ICCs > 0.90).
   There was high concurrent validity between the OPT and OFMF (r = 0.90, p
   < 0.0001). The correlations for the FFAm and GVA tests were somewhat
   weaker (r = -0.54, p < 0.0001). Correlations were negative; as
   functional feedings scores increased (improved), chewing time decreased
   (improved). Excellent reliable and valid assessment instruments are
   available to the practicing clinician. They cover a wide range of
   oral-motor performance and, so, must be used judiciously and for the
   purpose that they have been developed.}},

Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{134}},

Abstract = {{Removal of the peripheral vestibular receptor cells in one inner ear
   (unilateral vestibular deafferentation, UVD) results in a syndrome of
   ocular motor and postural disorders, many of which disappear over time
   in a process of behavioural recovery known as vestibular compensation.
   Excitatory amino acid receptors, in particular the N-methyl-D-aspartate
   (NMDA) receptor, have been implicated in vestibular compensation;
   however, the metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) have not been
   studied in this context. The aim of this study was to determine whether
   group I mGluRs in the brainstem vestibular nucleus complex (VNC)
   ipsilateral to the UVD are involved in vestibular compensation of the
   static symptoms of UVD in guinea pig. The selective group I mGluR
   antagonist (RS)-1-aminoindan-1,5,dicarboxylic acid (AIDA) was
   continuously infused into the ipsilateral VNC for 30-min pre-UVD and
   30-min post-UVD by cannula, at a rate of 1 mu l/h, using one of four
   doses: 0.1 fg, 0.1 pg, 0.1 ng or 0.1 mu g (n=5 animals in each case). In
   control conditions, a 0.1-fg (n=4) or 0.1-mu g (n=5) NaOH vehicle was
   infused into the ipsilateral VNC using the same protocol. In order to
   control for the possibility that AIDA disrupted spontaneous neuronal
   activity in the VNC in normal animals, 0.1 mu g AIDA (n=4) or 0.1 mu g
   NaOH (n=2) was infused into the VNC in labyrinthine-intact animals. In
   both groups, static symptoms of UVD (i.e. spontaneous nystagmus, SN, yaw
   head tilt, YHT and roll head tilt, RHT) were measured at 8, 10, 12, 15,
   20, 25, 30, 35, 45 and 50 h post-UVD. In addition, the righting reflex
   latency (RRL) was measured in labyrinthine-intact animals in order to
   assess whether AIDA impaired motor coordination in labyrinthine-intact
   animals. In UVD animals, the highest dose of AIDA significantly reduced
   SN frequency and changed its rate of compensation (P<0.001 and P<0.0001,
   respectively). This dose of AIDA also caused a significant reduction in
   YHT (P<0.005) as well as a significant change in its rate of
   compensation (P<0.0001). However, RHT was not significantly affected. In
   the labyrinthine-intact animals, AIDA infusion did not induce a UVD
   syndrome, nor did it significantly affect RRL. These results suggest
   that group I mGluRs in the ipsilateral VNC may be involved in the
   expression of ocular motor and some postural symptoms following UVD.
   Furthermore, group I mGluRs may not contribute to the resting activity
   of vestibular nucleus neurons.}},

Abstract = {{Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is commonly subdivided into four clinical
   types. Among these, OI type IV clearly represents a heterogeneous group
   of disorders. Here me describe 7 OI patients (3 girls), who would
   typically be classified as having OI type TV but who can be
   distinguished from other type TV patients. We propose to call this
   disease entity OI type V, These children had a history of moderate to
   severe increased fragility of long bones and vertebral bodies, Four
   patients had experienced at least one episode of hyperplastic callus
   formation, The family history was positive for OI in 3 patients, with an
   autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. All type V patients had
   limitations in the range of pronation/supination in one or both
   forearms, associated with a radiologically apparent calcification of the
   interosseous membrane. Three patients had anterior dislocation of the
   radial head, A radiodense metaphyseal band immediately adjacent to the
   growth plate was a constant feature in growing patients, Lumbar spine
   bone mineral density was low and similar to age-matched patients with OI
   type IV, None of the type V patients presented blue sclerae or
   dentinogenesis imperfecta, but ligamentous laxity was similar to that in
   patients with OI type IV. Levels of biochemical markers of bone
   metabolism generally were within the reference range, but serum alkaline
   phosphatase and urinary collagen type I N-telopeptide excretion
   increased markedly during periods of active hyperplastic callus
   formation. Qualitative histology of iliac biopsy specimens showed that
   lamellae were arranged in an irregular fashion or had a meshlike
   appearance. Quantitative histomorphometry revealed decreased amounts of
   cortical and cancellous bone, like in OI type IV, However, in contrast
   to OI type IV, parameters that reflect remodeling activation on
   cancellous bone were mostly normal in OI type V, while parameters
   reflecting bone formation processes in individual remodeling sites were
   clearly decreased. Mutation screening of the coding regions and
   exon/intron boundaries of both collagen type I genes did not reveal any
   mutations affecting glycine codons or splice sites. In conclusion, OI
   type V is a new form of autosomal dominant OI, which does not appear to
   be associated with collagen type I mutations. The genetic defect
   underlying this disease remains to be elucidated.}},

   hepatic calcifications typical of AE were classified as `abortive AE'
   patients, and those who had positive E. multilocularis serologies but no

   peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) stimulated in vitro with the
   mitogen phytohaemagglutinin-C or specific E. multilocularis antigenic

   opposite of that observed in progressive AE patients. An intermediate
   profile was observed in positive serology subjects. PBMC from abortive
   AE patients, whether non-stimulated or stimulated with PHA and antigenic

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to explore whether the conversion of the
   2-phenylindole system into the tetracyclic benzo{[}a]carbazole changes
   the endocrine profile when the side chain structure was kept constant.
   Five different sulfur-containing side chains were linked to the nitrogen
   of the tetracycle. The biological evaluation revealed that the character
   of the indole derivatives remained unchanged after the conversion to the
   respective benzocarbzoles but the potency decreased by one order of
   magnitude. In vitro, all derivatives acted as pure antiestrogens without
   any agonist activity. They strongly inhibited the growth of
   estrogen-sensitive MCF-7 breast cancer cells with IC50-values in the
   nanomolar range. In the mouse uterine weight test, the derivatives with
   an aliphatic side chain were devoid of estrogenic activity and
   antagonized the effect of estradiol. The presence of an aromatic ring in
   the side chain gave rise to significant agonist activity in vivo
   independently of the carrier structure. All data revealed the
   equivalence of both carrier structures in respect to the endocrine
   profile but showed a decrease in potency upon the conversion of the
   2-phenylindole system into the benzocarbazole structure.}},

   for the first time. Three roosts were studied during 14 days at the
   Reserva Florestal de Linhares, Espirito Santo state, Brazil. Males and
   females of each roost were marked on the first day of observation to
   evaluate possible flux of individuals among aggregations as well as
   roost fidelity. Roosts were censused daily at nightfall and at early
   morning, when notes on the behavior of aggregating individuals were also
   taken. Four tree species belonging to four families were used as
   roosting sites. The number of individuals in roosts varied daily, and
   roost size, as measured by the mean number of individuals, differed
   strikingly. A relatively low flux of individuals was detected among
   aggregations and most neuropterans usually returned to their original
   roost, showing some degree of roost fidelity. The sex ratio of
   aggregations was strongly biased to females and the observed number of
   dispersing individuals did not differ by sex. This new data suggests
   that aggregation behavior is a common feature within the genus
   Cordulecerus and that aggregations can be more than a random and casual
   assemblage of individuals, deserving futher quantitative investigations.}},

Abstract = {{Because of the wide utilization of rodents as animal models in
   respiratory research and the limited data on measurements of respiratory
   input impedance (Zrs) in small animals, me measured Zrs between 0.25 and
   9.125 Hz at different levels (0-7 hPa) of positive end-expiratory
   pressure (PEEP) in mice, rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits using a
   computer-controlled small-animal ventilator (Schuessler TF and Bates
   JHT, IEEE Trans Biomed Eng 42: 860-866, 1995). Zrs was fitted with a
   model, including a Newtonian resistance (R) and inertance in series with
   a constant-phase tissue compartment characterized by tissue damping
   (Gti) and elastance (Hti) parameters. Inertance was negligible in all
   cases. R, Gti, and Hti were normalized to body weight, yielding
   normalized R, Gti, and Hti (NHti), respectively. Normalized R tended to
   decrease slightly with PEEP and increased with animal size. Normalized
   Gti had a minimal dependence on PEEP. NHti decreased with increasing
   PEEP, reaching a minimum at similar to 5 hPa in all species except mice.
   NHti was also higher in mice and rabbits compared with guinea pigs and
   rats at low PEEPs, which we conclude is probably due to a relatively
   smaller air space volume in mice and rabbits. Our data also suggest that
   smaller rodents have proportionately wider airways than do larger
   animals. We conclude that a detailed, comparative study of respiratory
   system mechanics shows some evidence of structural differences among the
   lungs of various species but that, in general, rodent lungs obey scaling
   laws similar to those described in other species.}},

Abstract = {{This study deal's with the feasible use of a commercial activated carbon
   in the uptake of H(2)SO(4) from aqueous solution and with the
   regeneration of the spent product. Thermogravimetry TG and FT-IR
   spectroscopy are used in the analysis of samples. The activated carbon
   is a very effective material for the uptake of H(2)SO(4). Using a 9.0
   mol dm(-3) H(2)SO(4) solution, the mass increase is 37.8 wt\%. From the
   sample obtained, the H(2)SO(4) can be removed largely either by heating
   at 250 degrees C for 2 h in a N(2) atmosphere or by washing thoroughly
   with distilled water for 24 h. The mass loss in both cases amounts to
   33.6wt\%. The FT-IR spectroscopy results indicate that the surface
   chemistry of the carbon is not affected, noticeably, at least, after its
   contact with the H(2)SO(4) solution. The behavior of H(2)SO(4) toward
   carbon is compared with that of HNO(3). (C) 2000 Society of Chemical

   that also other physical quantities such as the cross-section angular

Abstract = {{The anisotropy of a passive scalar field at the level of second-order
   moments of the scalar derivatives is studied starting from the exact
   equations for the components of the second-rank tensor E defined by
   E-ij=2D<((partial derivative theta'/partial derivative x(i))(partial
   derivative theta'/partial derivative x(j)))over bar> (D is the molecular
   diffusivity of scalar theta). Analysis requires also the equations for
   the components of a mixed tensor defined by the correlations between
   scalar and velocity gradients. After the examination of this set of
   equations, it is conjectured that, in the case of forcing by a mean
   scalar gradient in isotropic turbulence, the anisotropy of tensor E is
   produced by cliffs of temperature occurring in the direction of the mean
   gradient. A model for this mechanism is proposed including possible
   indirect influence of shear through the large-scale anisotropy of the
   scalar field. Predictions in the situation where a mean scalar gradient
   is combined with homogeneous shear agree tolerably well with
   experimental data. This suggests that the proposed picture describing
   production of small-scale anisotropy implied by mean gradient forcing
   has to be completed. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

   a lesser extent IL-8, declined in the few days after alcohol abstinence

   carboxylic acids 6c, 7b are obtained by alkaline hydrolysis of the
   esters 6a, 7a. The carbinols 8, 9, formed by reduction of the esters 6a,
   7a, are oxidized to give the carbaldehydes 10, 11. The 1H-tetrazoles 17,
   18 are synthesized from the aldehydes 10, 11 via the aldoximes 13, 14
   and the nitriles 15, 16. The aldehydes 10, 11 react with the
   beta-aminocrotonic acid esters 19 in acetic acid to yield the
   1,4-dihydropyridines (DHP) 20, 21, which are dehydrogenated to form the
   pyridines (Py) 22, 23. The half-wave potentials E-1/2 Of the redox
   system DHP/Py is determinated by difference pulse voltammetry using

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of Candida infection
   of pancreatic necrosis in patients suffering from severe acute
   pancreatitis (SAP) and to analyze its impact on the outcome. Two-hundred
   and fifty consecutive patients with SAP from January 1986 to December
   1998 were studied retrospectively. Their mean APACHE II score at the day
   of admission was in 16.1 (range 8-35). All patients were in need of
   operative therapy. Overall mortality was 38.8\% (97 patients),
   One-hundred and eighty-two patients (72.8\%) suffered from local
   infected necrosis. Among these patients, local Candida infection was
   observed in 31 patients, whereof 23 patients (74\%) suffered from local
   fungal infection detected at first operation. During the course of
   disease, 12 patients (39\%) also revealed fungemia. Local Candida
   infection as compared to no Candida infection was associated with an
   increased mortality rate (84\% vs. 32\%; P < 0.0001). Multivariate
   logistic regression analysis identified APACHE II score (P < 0.0001),
   age of the patient (P < 0.003), extent of pancreatic necrosis (P <
   0.002), and local bacterial (P < 0.04) and fungal infection (P < 0.004)
   as independent factors significantly contributing to mortality. SAP,
   requiring surgical treatment, is associated with high in-hospital
   mortality. Patients suffering from local Candida infection are at high
   risk of fatal outcome.}},

Journal = {{BRITISH JOURNAL OF NUTRITION}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Coconut oil (CO) induces a triacylglycerol infiltration in the
   hepatocytes of preruminant calves when given as the sole source of fat
   in the milk diet over a long-term period. Metabolic pathways potentially
   involved in this hepatic triacylglycerol accumulation were studied by in
   vitro methods on liver slices from preruminant Holstein x Friesian male
   calves fed a conventional milk diet containing CO (n 5) or beef tallow
   (BT, n 5) for 19 d. Liver slices were incubated for 12 h in the presence
   of 0 . 8 mM-{[}C-14]oleate or -{[}C-14]laurate added to the medium.
   Fatty acid oxidation was determined by measuring the production of CO2
   (total oxidation) and acid-soluble products (partial oxidation).
   Production of CO2 was 1 . 7-3 . 6-fold lower (P 0 . 0490) and production
   of acid-soluble products tended to be lower (P = 0 . 0625) in liver
   slices of CO- than BT-fed calves. Fatty acid esterification as neutral
   lipids was 2 . 6- to 3 . 1-fold higher (P = 0 . 0088) in liver slices
   prepared from calves fed the CO diet compared with calves fed the BT
   diet. By contrast with what occurs in the liver of rats fed CO, the
   increase in neutral lipid production did not stimulate VLDL secretion by
   the hepatocytes of calves fed with CO, leading to a triacylglycerol
   accumulation in the cytosol. It could be explained by the reduction of
   fatty acid oxidation favouring esterification in the form of
   triacylglycerols, in association with a limited availability of
   triacylglycerols and/or apolipoprotein B for VLDL packaging and
   subsequent secretion.}},

Abstract = {{We studied heart rate and rhythm changes during sevoflurane inhalation

   recorded for 330 s (30 s pre- and 300 s postinduction) using a
   mini-Holter device (Recollect Dual Channel, Hertford Medical) and later
   analysed by an independent observer. Twelve patients developed nodal
   rhythm (six in each group), but no other dysrhythmias were recorded. The
   onset of nodal rhythm was associated with bradycardia (<80 bpm) in seven
   out of 12 cases, and occurred significantly earlier in the
   high-concentration group (median 123 (range 99-139) s versus 164
   (127-238) s). Its duration was similar in both groups (62 (2-84) s

Abstract = {{Previous studies of the gap-junction beta-2 subunit gene GJB2 (connexin
   26) have suggested that the 101T-->C (M34T) nucleotide substitution may
   be a mutant allele responsible for recessive deafness DFNB1. This
   hypothesis was consistent with observations of negligible intercellular
   coupling and gap-junction assembly of the M34T allele product expressed
   in Xenopus oocytes and HeLa cells. The results of our current study of a
   family cosegregating the 167delT allele of GJB2 and severe DFNB1
   deafness demonstrate that this phenotype did not cosegregate with the
   compound-heterozygous genotype M34T/167delT. Since 167delT is a null
   allele of GJB2, this result indicates that the in vivo activity of a
   single M34T allele is not sufficiently reduced to cause the typical
   deafness phenotype associated with DFNB1. This observation raises the
   possibility that other GJB2 missense substitutions may not be recessive
   mutations that cause severe deafness and emphasizes the importance of
   observing cosegregation with deafness in large families to confirm that
   these missense alleles are mutant DFNB1 alleles.}},

Abstract = {{Until the entry into force of the WTO Agreements, the European Court of
   Justice (ECJ) continuously denied the direct effect of the GATT 1947 in
   the European Community's legal order, in particular arguing that the
   GATT dispute settlement provisions were characterized by a great degree
   of flexibility. This case law triggered much debate and criticism, as
   well as high expectations of the first judgment in which the Court would
   assess the legal effect of WTO law. In Portugal v. Council, the ECJ did
   not change its general rule whereby WTO law cannot be relied on to
   review the legality of acts of the European Community. Setting out a
   two-step test, the Court first denied that the WTO Dispute Settlement
   Understanding itself obliges the European Community to implement rulings
   by making them directly enforceable. Second, it denied the possibility
   of doing so autonomously. However, the Court upheld its case law
   regarding exceptions to this rule, including the possibility that WTO
   provisions can serve as a benchmark for reviewing Community acts taken
   to implement WTO Agreements.
   This annotation criticizes the ECJ's reasoning, in particular the
   underlying assumption that WTO law lacks unconditional mandatory force,
   and the notion of reciprocity. It argues that the judgment is
   misconceived. Yet, it concludes that, inter alia, the possibility of
   invoking WTO provisions when reviewing the large number of measures
   implementing WTO Agreements might open the door towards strengthening
   the legal effects of WTO law in the Community.}},

Abstract = {{Articular cartilage is a physiologically hypoxic tissue with a proposed
   gradient of oxygen tension ranging from about 10\% oxygen at the
   cartilage surface to less than 1\% in the deepest layers. The position
   of the chondrocyte within this gradient may modulate the cell's behavior
   and phenotype. Moreover, the oxygen gradient is likely to be disturbed
   during joint diseases in which the pO(2) of the synovial fluid declines
   which may cause changes in chondrocyte behavior and gene expression.
   Thus, there is a need to understand the chondrocyte's response to
   different oxygen tensions. We compared the behavior of bovine articular
   chondrocytes cultured in alginate beads for 7 days in medium maintained
   at <0.1, 5, 10 or 20\% oxygen. The chondrocytes' survival,
   differentiation, cell division, viability and matrix production were
   assessed at each oxygen tension and rRNA and mRNA abundance was
   measured.
   Chondrocytes were able to survive under all oxygen tensions for at least
   7 days but cells cultured under anoxic conditions were metabolically
   less active than cells maintained in higher oxygen tensions; this was
   associated with a decrease in matrix production. In <0.1\% oxygen there
   was a marked decrease in rRNA and mRNA abundance in the cells. There
   were no differences in cell division or differentiation between any
   oxygen tensions. These findings indicate that articular chondrocytes can
   be cultured successfully in the pO(2) range in which they are thought to
   exist in vivo (5-10\% pO(2)) and are fully active under these
   conditions. Under anoxic conditions (<0.1\% pO(2)) function is severely
   compromised. (C) 2000 OsteoArthritis Research Society international.}},

Abstract = {{Data were collected over a two-year period at four localities in

   Faure, in mango orchards. Using a two-stage sampling system for
   determining population levels, the optimum combination of the number of
   trees per orchard (primary units) and fruit per tree (secondary units),
   was estimated. Taylor's power law regression of log(S-2) on log((X) over
   bar..) provided a good fit for both the within-tree (r(2) = 0.887) and
   between-tree (r(2) = 0.746) data. The value for the aggregation
   coefficient, b, in both cases was >1, indicating a clumped distribution.
   Sampling precision, D, improved with increasing average numbers of S.
   aurantii per fruit. In addition, keeping the total number of fruit
   examined constant, sampling precision at low population levels improved
   by increasing the number of trees sampled and decreasing the number of
   fruit examined per tree. Examining 50 fruit per orchard should be
   sufficient for obtaining suitably accurate population estimates for pest

Abstract = {{We analyzed seasonally aggregated observations of temperature,
   conductivity, dissolved oxygen and dissolved inorganic carbon from
   Soppensee (District of Lucerne, Switzerland) for the yrs 1980 to 1993.
   Holomictic Soppensee is characterized by a strong summer stratification
   with a thin epilimnion separated from an anoxic hypolimnion by a strong
   pycnocline formed by thermal and chemical gradients. A vertical
   one-dimensional model was developed to simulate the observed seasonal
   cycles of carbon and oxygen. The processes of net community production,
   mineralization of organic matter, precipitation and dissolution of
   calcite, gas exchange, in- and outflow, sedimentation and vertical eddy
   diffusion are included. According to the model, the annual net community
   production is estimated to about 110 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and the annual net
   primary production to about 330 to 440 g C m(-2) yr(-1), which is a
   typical value for eutrophic lakes. A mass balance of the carbon cycle
   indicates that most of the inflow comes from groundwater which is
   super-saturated with respect to atmospheric CO(2). Therefore the surface
   waters exhibit a large capacity for calcite precipitation. The results
   of the model are used to constrain the conditions that favor the
   formation of varved sediments in Soppensee during thousands of yrs.
   Model calculations show that the deep waters would still turn anoxic
   even if the sedimentation rate of organic matter were decreased to 25\%.
   Several physical factors such as biogenic stabilization of the deep
   waters due to calcite dissolution and low input of wind energy are
   responsible for the long term anoxia in Soppensee.}},

   hemostasis after a catheterization procedure was performed via the

   contraindicated for a procedure through femoral approach. In both cases
   the closures were successful without complications. An aggressive

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{There is commonly a linear relationship between the lengths of rock
   fractures and their displacements, but for many fracture populations
   there is a very large scatter in the data. In the lava flows of the rift
   zone in Iceland, the displacements on a fracture or fault of a given
   length may vary by a factor of 2-10. Similar scatter is obtained for the
   aperture (width)/length ratios of several hundred mineral-filled veins
   in a major fault zone. I propose that the displacement on a fracture
   depends mostly on the smaller of its dip and strike dimensions, referred
   to as. the controlling dimension. Thus, in a horizontal outcrop,
   fractures with the same strike dimension (outcrop length) can have
   widely different displacements depending on whether the displacements of
   individual fractures are controlled by strike or dip dimensions. During
   growth of a fracture, its controlling dimension may alternate between
   the dip dimension and the strike dimension. The volumetric rate of flow
   of fluid through a rock fracture with smooth, parallel walls depends on
   the cube of the fracture aperture. This cubic law implies that when the
   aperture of a fracture of a given length in a single set or population
   can vary by a factor of 2-10, the corresponding volumetric rate of fluid
   flow through that fracture can vary by a factor of 8-1000. A single,
   wide fracture in a set of as many as several hundred fractures may thus
   largely dominate the fluid transport through that set. Fracture aperture
   depends not only on the associated stress field, but also on its
   controlling dimension. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

   Both headspace (HS)-SPME and direct SPME were studied. The method
   requires only a few milliliters of sample and 20 min for completion, At
   2.0 mu g/L concentration, the relative standard deviation was 10.1\% for
   HS-SPME and 9.1\% for direct SPME. For HS-SPME, the theoretical
   detection limit was 81 ng/L and 166 ng/L for direct SPME, The recovery
   rate was 95\%. The method was used to determine Se4+ in 10 tap water
   samples.}},

   endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy in our Gastroenterology Clinic for 8
   consecutive months. Sclerotherapy of the esophageal varices had been
   performed at monthly intervals until variceal obliteration was achieved.
   Both the intravariceal and paravariceal injection techniques were used
   and injections were repeated periodically as necessary. On the 8th
   month, 1 week after the 4th sclerotherapy procedure, the patient
   complained of swelling on his right shoulder and on his right arm. There
   was jugular congestion and swelling of his right arm and right shoulder.
   The patient was hemodynamically stable. An X-ray of brachial venography
   revealed an obstruction of the vena subclavia dextra. During follow-up,
   the jugular congestion and swelling of his right arm gradually subsided
   spontaneously over a 6-month period without any need for medication.
   There has been no recurrence of his symptoms during the 1-year follow-up

   societal factors (such as racism, sexism, classism, and ageism) on
   substance use. Rationale and guidelines for designing ethnically
   sensitive and gender-specific research projects and intervention
   programs regarding substance use prevention are offered. Public health

Abstract = {{A theoretical light curve for the 1987 outburst of V394 Coronae
   Australis (V394 CrA) is modeled to obtain various physical parameters of
   this recurrent nova. We then apply the same set of parameters to a
   quiescent phase and confirm that these parameters give a unified picture
   of the binary. Our V394 CrA model consists of a very massive white dwarf
   (WD), with an accretion disk (ACDK) having a flaring-up rim, and a
   lobe-filling, slightly evolved, main-sequence star (MS). The model
   includes irradiation effects of the MS and the ACDK by the WD. The early
   visual light curve (t similar to 1-10 days after the optical maximum) is
   well reproduced by a thermonuclear runaway model on a very massive WD
   close to the Chandrasekhar limit (1.37 +/- 0.01 M.). The ensuing plateau
   phase (t similar to 10-30 days) is also reproduced by the combination of
   a slightly irradiated MS and a fully irradiated flaring-up disk with a
   radius similar to 1.4 times the Roche lobe size. The best-fit parameters
   are the WD mass similar to 1.37 M., the companion mass similar to 1.5 M.
   (0.8-2.0 M. is acceptable), the inclination angle of the orbit i similar
   to 65 degrees-68 degrees, and the flaring-up rim similar to 0.30 times
   the disk radius. The envelope mass at the optical peak is estimated to
   be similar to 6 x 10(-6) M., which indicates an average mass accretion
   rate of similar to 1.5 x 10(-7) M, yr(-1) during the quiescent phase
   between the 1949 and 1987 outbursts. In the quiescent phase, we properly
   include the accretion luminosity of the WD and the viscous luminosity of
   the ACDK as well as the irradiation effects of the ACDK and MS by the
   WD. The observed light curve can be reproduced with a disk size of 0.7
   times the Roche lobe size and a rather slim thickness of 0.05 times the
   accretion disk size at the rim. About 0.5 mag sinusoidal variation of
   the light curve requires a mass accretion rate higher than similar to
   1.0 x 10-7 M, yr(-1), which is consistent with the above estimation from
   the 1987 outburst. These newly obtained quantities are exactly the same
   as those predicted in a new progenitor model of Type Ia supernovae.}},

   The charismatic personality of Jung and the universality of his ideas
   not only attracted famous scientists from all over the world and from
   different disciplines, but led to many foundations of similar
   psychological clubs. Papers given in the Club included disciplines like
   comparative history of religion, ethnology, Middle Eastern studies and

Abstract = {{The kinetics of the decomposition of ozone have been studied in acidic
   aqueous solutions by means of spectrophotometric techniques in order to
   obtain more information on the mechanism of this process. The effects of
   the purity of the oxygen gas used for preparing the ozone solution, the
   ozone concentration, ageing of the solution, pH (2-6), and the
   dependence on the ionic strength of the solution were investigated. It
   was found that the maximum ozone concentration and the
   self-decomposition of ozone in solution strongly depend on all these
   factors. The individual decomposition curves could be simulated
   successfully by using a simplified reaction scheme that involves the
   formation of a radical chain reaction initiated by the reaction of ozone
   with hydroxide ion. This reaction scheme gives a very good
   representation of the experimental data over a wide pH range (1-6) and
   initial ozone concentration (1.5-3.5 x 10(4) mol dm(3)) over a
   relatively long period of time (minutes and longer). From these
   simulations it was possible to obtain estimates of the equilibrium
   concentrations of transient species and by-products formed during the
   decomposition of ozone. It followed from these calculations that the
   hydroxyl radical is the most abundant radical species and hydrogen
   peroxide a major product in equilibrated ozone solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Cliff protection schemes are designed to reduce the risk of damage or
   permanent loss of cliff-top assets as a result of coastal cliff
   recession and landsliding, To identify the most efficient scheme in

   that each of the scheme options will achieve. This paper introduces a
   risk-based approach to evaluating the economic benefits of coastal cliff
   protection. The approach is applicable to economic appraisal of schemes
   for currently protected and unprotected coastal sites. Example
   appraisals of sites prone to progressive cliff recession, large
   catastrophic landslides and minor recurrent ground movement are
   included. Methods for including and structuring expert judgements of
   failure probabilities are explored. A risk-based approach is preferable
   to current practice, which is essentially deterministic, because it
   reflects the uncertainty that is inherent in recession predictions,
   Current deterministic methods can underestimate the economic risk
   associated with cliff recession.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by applications to brightness data on periodic variable stars,
   we study nonparametric methods for estimating both the period and the

   at irregularly spaced times. It is shown that nonparametric estimators
   of period converge at parametric rates and attain a semiparametric lower
   bound which is the same if the shape of the periodic function is unknown
   as if it were known. Also, first-order properties of nonparametric
   estimators of the amplitude function are identical to those that would
   obtain if the period were known. Numerical simulations and applications
   to real data show the method to work well in practice.}},

Abstract = {{The effects were examined of replacing part or all of the soybean meal
   in the starter and finisher diets for male broiler chickens with ground,
   roasted, full-fat soybeans from either a high-protein (AC Proteus) or
   conventional (Baron) cultivar. The starter (1-21 d) and finisher (22-36
   d) diets were formulated by replacing, on an isonitrogenous basis, part
   or all of the soybean meal in the barley-wheat-based control diets with
   the roasted soybeans. Digestibility of dry matter, corrected nitrogen
   and energy were estimated by an index method for the last 2 d of the
   starter and grower periods. Soybean level influenced body weight gains
   directly in a quadratic manner, and feed intakes or feed conversions by
   inversely Linear relationships (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01) during the
   starter period. Performance during the finisher period or during the
   entire growth period was not influenced (P > 0.05) by dietary soybean
   source. Dry matter and energy digestibilities at both 21 and 35 d, and
   nitrogen at 35 d were affected in a quadratic manner (P < 0.05 or P <
   0.01) by the soybean level of the diets, whereas, a linear relationship
   was present for the apparent metabolizable energy (AME) content (P <
   0.001). Soybean source had no effect on nutrient utilization, except for
   dry matter or energy digestibility during the starter period (P < 0.01).
   In conclusion, the optimal performance should be obtained when the ratio
   of roasted full-fat soybeans to soybean meal is about 2:1 in the starter
   feeds for broiler chickens.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, much interest has been expressed in understanding how animals
   use phenotypic plasticity of tissue size and function to meet increased
   metabolic demands. We set out to learn (i) whether female deer mice
   (Peromyscus maniculatus) given lactation (two to seven pups per litter),
   cold (5 degreesC), or cold plus lactation as energy demands display
   phenotypic plasticity in organ size and function; (ii) whether that
   plasticity is similar to laboratory mice given the same demands; and
   (iii) whether lactational performance in deer mice is derived from
   limits on central or peripheral organs. We found that deer mice
   responded to lactation by increasing digestible food intake and
   increasing the masses of the stomach, small intestine, cecum and liver,
   and the length of the small intestine. Heart mass was lower in lactating
   than in nonlactating mice. Cold exposure also caused increases in
   digestible food intake and increases in the masses of the small
   intestine, kidney, and heart. We conclude that deer mice display organ
   tissue plasticity in response to both lactation and cold exposure in a
   similar manner to laboratory mice. We also conclude that deer mice are
   not limited by central processing organs because they are able to
   increase digestive organ size continuously with increased energetic
   demands.}},

   depression can be reversed by the potentiation and vice versa. Finally,

Abstract = {{The paper provides a conversion regime from even-aged to uneven-aged
   stands of Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.). The conversion regime
   was tested by the distance-dependent single-tree simulator SILVA 2.1.
   The initial data for the simulation and the assumed site productivity
   were deduced using inventory data of the north Black Forest. The
   conversion regime was compared to a typical future-tree oriented
   age-class treatment system. Thereby four variants of the conversion
   regime, differing in the number and diameter of the
   `regeneration-funnels' (gaps in the canopy of the stand) which were
   created during the `graded-regeneration-phase', were compared To a
   basal-area oriented future-tree age-class treatment. A simulation-run of
   110 years - divided into 22 periods of five years - was conducted. The
   analysis of the simulation-run showed that the possibilities to achieve
   uneven-aged structures in single-layered, even-aged stands through
   `structuring measures' during thinning or target-diameter harvesting
   were very limited. The success of the conversion depended mainly on the
   success of the regeneration during the conversion. The early creation of
   `regeneration-funnels' was linked to severe losses in increment and
   standing volume. As well as influences on different stand-parameters
   (e.g. stem-distribution) changes in structure-parameters caused by the
   conversion could be assessed. In particular, the modified Shannon-index
   did react distinctly to the implementation of the natural regeneration
   in the regeneration-funnels. Indeed, a steady state was only temporarily
   reached with the variant with the largest gaps. Finally, the results of
   the conversion experiment were subject to a critical review. Thus, the
   limits of the model in its current version and further research needs
   were discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We prospectively compared the value of MRI and clinical palpation for
   detecting cervical metastases in patients with primary cancer of the
   head and neck. Sixty patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the upper
   aerodigestive tract were evaluated with MRI and clinical palpation
   before undergoing a total of 81 neck dissections. The results of
   preoperative clinical palpation and MRI were compared with the
   histopathologic outcome. The sensitivity and specificity were 75.6\% and
   97.5\%, respectively, for clinical palpation and 73.2\% and 95\%,
   respectively, for MRI, The rate of occult cervical metastasis was 24\%
   with clinical palpation and 26.8\% with MRI, The use of MRI did not
   improve the rate of early detection of occult metastasis, nor did it
   improve the detection of extracapsular spread. Our findings show that we
   could not depend on palpation or MRI alone to determine the need for
   elective neck dissection. However, MRI can be used to improve the

   evaluation, and dissemination processes used by the Nutrition Education
   and Prevention Program administration and core faculty group at the
   University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. Beginning in 1990, the
   nutrition curriculum was initiated with the assistance of several
   funding sources. The program was structured using a multidisciplinary
   faculty group of physicians and registered dietitians from multiple
   departments, centers, and institutes. The outcome of this process is a
   textbook, Medical Nutrition and Disease, currently required by numerous
   medical schools, residency programs, and other health professional
   programs across the nation. With the use of data from the Association of
   American Medical Colleges All Schools Survey of Graduating Medical
   Students, perceptions of the adequacy of nutrition education were
   tracked over time. In 1991, 80\% of University of Pennsylvania medical
   students felt that nutrition coverage was inadequate compared with 10\%
   of medical students in 1998, a significant change resulting from the
   nutrition program's effect. The University of Pennsylvania School of
   Medicine has developed and implemented a successful nutrition
   curriculum, despite national trends. The case-based integrated
   curricular model presented in Medical Nutrition and Disease and on our

Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{689-694}},

Abstract = {{This essay explores the experience of intolerable human suffering in
   Toni Cade Bambara's novel, The Salt Eaters. The method of analysis is
   literary criticism, a technique that shares many of the same goals as
   other types of inquiry. It employs close reading to illuminate the
   novel's meaning(s), thereby revealing information about the nature of
   intolerable human suffering. Morrison's characteristics of black art is
   the literary and cultural framework that guides the analysis of
   Bambara's novel. The paradigm has broad application for nursing. The
   purpose of this analysis was to describe the role of the ancestral
   system as a predictor of the trajectory of suffering. The results extend
   Morrison's paradigm and her notion of ancestor to include traditions and
   other non-corporeal factors that are essential for well-being and
   survival. The protagonist in Bambara's novel, Velma Henry, is the
   patient and exemplar who does not succumb to intolerable suffering
   because of its cumulative weight, but because she has lost touch with
   the traditions of her people, an essential component of her ancestral
   system. The ancestral system is a rich and complex network of
   individuals, groups, customs and beliefs that are instructive,
   protective and benevolent. Ancestors are also timeless and provide
   wisdom, but when the ancestral system is weak or absent, the trajectory
   of suffering is not favourable. Nurses must learn to recognize
   intolerable human suffering, to identify the patient's ancestral system,
   and to work within that system to keep suffering patients from harm.}},

Abstract = {{Few sleep deprivation (SD) studies involve realism or high-level
   decision making, factors relevant to managers, military commanders, and
   so forth, who are undergoing prolonged work during crises. Instead,
   research hits favored simple tasks sensitive to SD mostly because of
   their dull monotony. In contrast, complex rule-based, convergent and
   logical tasks are unaffected by short-term SD, seemingly because of
   heightened participant interest and compensatory effort. However, recent
   findings show that despite this effort, SD still impairs decision making
   involving the unexpected, innovation, revising plans, competing
   distraction, and effective communication. Decision-making models
   developed outside SD provide useful perspectives on these latter
   effects, as does a neuropsychological explanation of sleep function. SD
   presents particular difficulties for sleep-deprived decision makers who
   require these latter skills during emergency situations.}},

Abstract = {{Growth hormone (GH) secretion decreases progressively after mid-puberty
   in both men and women. This decrease occurs predominantly before age
   40-50 and affects both daytime and nocturnal GH secretion. A reduction
   in the amplitude of GH secretory pulses accounts for the majority of the
   reduction in GH secretion. With aging, changes in hypothalamic function
   may occur that result in decreased GH secretion. These changes may
   include decreased secretion of GH-releasing hormone and/or the putative
   natural ligand for the GH secretagogue receptor or an increase in
   somatostatin release. Multiple physiological factors have been reported
   to regulate GH secretion including sleep, body composition (\% body fat
   and amount of abdominal visceral fat), aerobic physical fitness and
   serum concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), gonadal
   steroids and insulin. Changes in these factors with aging may contribute
   to the reduction in GH secretion observed in older adults. However,
   these physiological predictors of GH secretion are not independent of
   one another and the relative importance of these factors in the
   regulation of GH secretion is not known. Preliminary evidence suggests
   that the amount of abdominal visceral fat and fasting serum
   concentrations of insulin and IGF-I are the most important predictors of
   24-hour GH release in healthy adults, independent of age and gender.
   Bi-directional feedback between these three factors and GH secretion may
   account for the strong relationships observed.}},

Abstract = {{Parallel processing is more stable than serial processing in many areas

   microbial community function using two quadruplicate sets of
   methanogenic communities, each set having substantially different
   populations. The ho communities were maintained at a mean cell residence
   time of 16 days and a mean glucose loading rate of 0.34 g/liter-day in
   variable-volume reactors. To test stability to perturbation, they were
   subjected to an instantaneous glucose pulse that resulted in a
   6.8-g/liter reactor concentration. The pattern of accumulated products
   in response to the perturbation was analyzed for various measures of
   functional stability, including resistance, resilience, and reactivity
   for each product. A new stability parameter, ``moment of amplification
   envelope,{''} was used to compare the soluble compound stability. These
   parameters indicated that the communities with predominantly parallel
   substrate processing were functionally more stable in response to the
   perturbation than the communities with predominantly serial substrate
   processing. The data also indicated that there was good replication of
   function under perturbed conditions; the degrees of replication were
   0.79 and 0.83 for the two test communities.}},

Abstract = {{Efficiency of UV disinfection of unfiltered and filtered secondary
   wastewater effluent, using a large-scale pilot system, and the
   inactivation of six bacterial species in a laboratory UV-device have
   been studied. Pilot plant studies revealed low levels of coliforms and
   streptococci (3 logarithmic units reduction) when a wastewater UV
   transmission of 45\% and an average effective UV dose of 100 mW a cm(-2)
   were used. By contrast, removal of Pseudomonas aeruginosa appeared
   insufficient (<1.1 logarithmic units). Laboratory investigations, using
   the six bacterial species as reference, showed that the kinetics of
   bacterial removal agreed with the model of Chick-Watson, which is
   formulated by the equation dN/dt = -k'(CN)-N-n. It also appeared, that
   according to the UV dose applied, two types of inactivation prevailed: a
   high rate of inactivation, with weak UV doses, and a low rate of
   inactivation with relatively high doses. Each examined strain was
   characterised by two K coefficients, (K-1 and K-2). Lower the K value,
   more the bacterial resistance to UV. Hierarchical classification of
   bacteria, based on the values of kinetic constants, revealed three
   groups of different sensitivity to UV. A resistant group, represented by
   the two strains of P. aeruginosa ATCC 15442 and Bacillus subtilis 6633,
   and a sensitive group, with the strain of Escherichia coli ATCC 11229. A
   medium group was represented by Enterococcus ATCC 19433, Serratia
   marcescens ATCC 8100 and P. aeruginosa S21. Kinetic studies revealed
   that the first instants of exposure (2-10 s) to a UV intensity of 5-8 mW
   cm(-2) appeared as deciding factors in the disinfection with UV
   irradiation. The importance of cumulative UV dose was only secondary.
   Photoreactivation of micro-organisms following UV disinfection was
   observed with all bacterial strains studied here, except for P.
   aeruginosa ATCC 15442, P. aeruginosa ATCC 15442 mutant mt and
   Enterococcus hirac ATCC 10541. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the usefulness of collagenase immunocytochemistry
   as well as its immunohistochemistry in assessing the correlation with
   prognostic factors in transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urinary
   bladder.
   STUDY DESIGN: We investigated the expression of collagenase in
   catheterized urine and histologic specimens from 38 patients with TCC
   and 20 cases with benign lesions of the urinary tract.
   RESULTS: Thirteen (34.2\%) and 17 (44.7\%) patients with TCC showed
   positive expression of collagenase on cytologic and histologic
   specimens, respectively, whereas in no cases with benign lesions was
   such expression found (P<.01). Invasive and nonpapillary TCC had higher
   positive rates than noninvasive and papillary TCC. Grade 3 TCC was
   positive at a higher rate than was grade 2, whereas there were no
   positive cases with grade 1. Collagenase expression did Mot correlate
   significantly with stage.
   CONCLUSION: Collagenase expression in urinary TCC correlated well with
   tumor growth pattern, pathologic grade and invasiveness of the
   carcinoma; all are known to be prognostic factors. The application of
   collagenase immunostaining to urinary cytology is very useful for
   assessing prognosis in TCC.}},

Abstract = {{The contribution of genetic factors to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's
   disease (PD) is supported by the demonstration of the high concordance
   in twins studies using positron emission tomography (PET), the increased
   risk among relatives of PD patients in case-control and family studies,
   and the existence of familial PD and parkinsonism by single gene defect.
   Recently several genes have been mapped and/or identified. alpha
   -Synuclein is involved in a rare dominant form of familial PD with
   dopa-responsive parkinsonism features and Lewy body-positive pathology.
   In contrast, parkin is responsible for the autosomal recessive form
   (AR-JP) of early onset PD with Lewy body-negative pathology. The
   clinical features of this form include early onset (in the 20s),
   levodopa-responsive parkinsonism, diurnal fluctuation, and slow
   progression of the disease. Parkin consists of 12 exons and the
   estimated size is over 1.5Mb. To date, variable mutations such as
   deletions or point mutations resulting in missense and nonsense changes
   have been reported in AR-JP patients. In addition, the localization of
   parkin indicates that parkin may be involved in the axonal transport
   system. More recently we have found that parkin interacts with the
   ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 and is functionally linked to the
   Ub-proteasome pathway as a ubiquitin ligase, E3. These findings fit the
   characteristics of a lack of Lewy bodies (these are cytoplasmic
   inclusions that are considered to be a pathological hallmark). Our
   findings should enhance the exploration of the mechanisms of neuronal
   death in PD as well as other neurodegenerative disorders of which
   variable inclusion bodies are observed.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Correction of craniofacial microsomia (CFM) presents several
   challenges concerning the modality of surgical intervention. The aim of
   this study was to assess early and late surgical outcome, by undertaking
   Euclidean distance matrix analysis (EDMA) of CFM patients exhibiting an
   unilateral mandibular deformity that was surgically corrected by an
   inverted L osteotomy and autogenous bone graft.
   Design: Longitudinal study. Preoperative, approximate to 1-year
   postoperative and approximate to 3-year postoperative assessments of 14
   consecutive children (mean age 9 years) with CFM. Posteroanterior
   cephalographs were scanned and five homologous mandibular landmarks were
   digitized in triplicate (< 1\% digitization error). Average mandibular
   geometries, scaled to an equivalent size, were generated using a
   generalized rotational fit program (Procrustes superimposition) and
   subjected to EDMA,
   Results: The mean pre- and both postoperative mandibular configurations
   differed statistically (p < .01). Early postoperative improvements in
   mandibular form were noted; increases in length arising in the treated
   mandibular body (approximate to 19\%) and ramus (approximate to 13\%).
   Comparing early and late postoperative configurations, a decrease of
   approximate to 22\% in the late postoperative mandibular body length was
   evident, but the ramus maintained steady vertical growth (approximate to
   7\%). Comparing the preoperative and late postoperative configurations,
   the decrease observed in the mandibular body on the treated side was
   reduced to approximate to 8\% while the ramus maintained good growth
   (approximate to 20\%) on that side.
   Conclusion: Mandibular morphology is improved significantly in CFM
   patients surgically treated by an inverted L osteotomy, but relapse in
   the mandibular body is evident after approximate to 3 years.
   Nevertheless, ramus growth proceeds well after the surgical
   reconstruction.}},

Abstract = {{The photon energy dependence of the photoelectron photoion coincidence
   (PEPICO) spectra near the Se K-edge have been measured for Se-2 and
   larger species such as Se-5 at the BL-12C in Photon Factory. The PEPICO
   spectra reveal that the multiply charged ions, Sez+, are produced as a
   result of the de-excitation process following the inner-shell
   excitation. Two prominent structures corresponding to the pi{*} and
   sigma{*} resonances are clearly observed in the energy dependence of the
   branching ratio from Se-2, while only one structure corresponding to the
   sigma{*} resonance can be seen for the larger species. At the sigma{*}
   resonance, the production of Se+ and Se2+ is enhanced, in comparison
   with the direct ionization where the core-hole states are completely
   relaxed before the dissociation. The energies of the pi{*} and sigma{*}
   resonance relative to the Is ionization potential are estimated at -
   10.0 +/- 0.5 eV and -5 +/- 1eV, respectively. In addition, we propose a

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. Defensins are naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides.
   Recently the authors published evidence of defensin production by the
   human ocular surface. A study was undertaken to look for intraocular
   defensins that may account for unexplained antimicrobial activity of
   intraocular fluids.
   METHODS. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was
   performed on human postmortem ciliary body samples for beta defensins-1
   (HBD-1) and beta defensin-2 (HBD-2), and alpha defensins 5 and 6.
   Induction of defensins by cytokines was analyzed in cultured human
   ciliary body epithelial (CBE) and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE)
   cells. Polyclonal antibodies were used to immunoblot aqueous and
   vitreous to detect HBD-1 and HBD-2 and to estimate their concentration.
   RESULTS. RT-PCR revealed constitutive HBD-1 message in ciliary body.
   HBD-2 and alpha defensin 5 and 6 messages were absent. HBD-2 message was
   induced by cytokine stimulation of both CBE and RPE cells. Immunoblots
   of vitreous and aqueous stained positively for HBD-1 but not HBD-2. The
   estimated aqueous concentration of HBD-1 was less than 16 ng/ml.
   CONCLUSIONS. This Study demonstrates that HBD-1 is constitutively
   present in the aqueous and vitreous. probably at sub-bacteriocidal
   concentrations. HBD-2, was absent from aqueous, but cytokine stimulation
   studies suggest that it may be generated in response to inflammatory
   cytokines during infections. HBD-2 has a wider antibacterial spectrum,
   is 10-fold more potent, and may play a more significant role in
   antimicrobial defense than HBD-1. The use of defensins therapeutically
   may be indicated; however, caution is required because defensins also
   promote cell proliferation and fibrin formation, which are 2 key
   elements in ocular scarring processes such as proliferative
   vitreoretinopathy.}},

Abstract = {{The hygropreference of adult Onychiurus arcticus (Tullberg) was
   investigated over 2 h at 0, 10 and 20 degrees C, along humidity
   gradients (12-98\% RH) established using different salt solutions. At
   all temperatures 0. arcticus preferred the highest humidity (98\% KH).
   At 0 and 20 degrees C, saturated conditions were preferred to 98\% RH.
   The hygropreference of the mite Lauroppia translamellata (Willmann) was
   also assessed at 20 degrees C, and no clear RH preference was observed.
   This species survived the loss of 24.9 +/- 2.1\% of its initial water
   content when held for 24 h at 20 degrees C and 12\% RH. A range of
   assays designed to eliminate the influence of thigmotactic behaviour and
   population clumping pen-nit exclusion of these factors as being
   responsible for the observed results. The mean initial water content of
   O. arcticus samples (71.7 +/- 10.9, 73.4 +/- 4.0 and 73.8 +/- 23.5\% at
   0, 10 and 20 degrees C, respectively) did not differ significantly
   between temperatures, indicating that the results were not influenced by
   differences in initial hydrated state. The percentage water loss of
   individuals within the gradient increased with temperature, and differed
   significantly between regimes. The ecological significance of the
   observed humidity preferences are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: In order to investigate overtraining-related adaptations in the
   autonomic nervous system, cardiac autonomic activity was examined in a
   junior cross-country skier who presented with reduced performance in
   competitions, early breathlessness during training sessions, and
   accumulated central fatigue. Methods: Power spectral analysis of heart
   rate variability (HRV) was performed before, when overtrained (OT), and
   after recovery (Rec). Results: In the overtrained state, high frequency
   (I-IF) and total powers in the lying position were higher compared with
   before and after. In normalized units, the increased HF in OT was even
   more prominent and clearly higher than in any control subject, and it
   was reversed in Rec. Resting heart rate was slightly reduced in OT and
   returned to baseline in Rec. Conclusions: The shift toward increased
   heart rate variability, particularly in the HF range, together with a
   reduced resting heart rate suggest a cardiac autonomic imbalance with
   extensive parasympathetic modulation in this athlete when overtrained.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of tumor anemia and
   thrombocytosis in patients with vulvar cancer, and to evaluate the
   prognostic value or pretreatment hemoglobin (Hb) and platelet count
   regarding disease-free and overall survival of patients with vulvar
   cancer. We measured pretreatment Hb and platelet count in 62 patients
   with squamous cell vulvar cancer. The results were correlated to
   clinical data. Median Hb and platelet count in patients with vulvar
   cancer were 13.1 g/dl (range 8.3-16.2) and 268,500/mu l (range
   88,000-778,000), respectively. Cut-off levels of 12 g/dl and 300,000/mu
   l were selected for tumor anemia and tumor thrombocytosis, respectively
   according to published criteria. Tumor anemia and tumor thrombocytosis
   were present in 30.6 and 27.4\% of patients with vulvar cancer,
   respectively. In a univariate analysis tumor stage and tumor
   thrombocytosis were significantly associated with a shortened
   disease-free (log-rank test, p < 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively) and
   overall survival (log-rank test, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively).
   Tumor anemia was not associated with a shortened disease-free, but with
   a shortened overall survival of patients with vulvar cancer (log-rank
   test, p = 0.1 and p = 0.002, respectively). A multivariate Cox
   regression model considering tumor stage, tumor anemia, and tumor
   thrombocytosis showed, however, that pretreatment Hb and platelet count
   did not confer additional prognostic information to that already
   obtained by the established prognosticator tumor stage on disease free
   (multivariate Cox regression model, p = 0.8, p = 0.2, and p = 0.003,
   respectively) and overall survival (multivariate Cox regression model, p
   = 0.4, p = 0.5, and p = 0.04, respectively). Pretreatment tumor anemia
   and tumor thrombocytosis were associated with a poor prognosis, but were
   not an independent predictor of outcome in patients with vulvar cancer.

Abstract = {{Introduction: Gastric emptying is delayed in patients with idiopathic
   slow-transit constipation (ISTC). Gastric emptying was measured before
   and after colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis in patients with ISTC to
   determine whether the abnormality persists after operation.
   Methods: Twelve patients undergoing colectomy for severe ISTC had
   solid-phase gastric emptying measured after an overnight fast. All 12
   had an uncomplicated subtotal colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis; 11
   had an excellent functional outcome. In ten of these patients gastric
   emptying was repeated within 3 months of operation. Seven patients
   (including the remaining two) had the study performed at 1 year.
   Results: All 12 patients had severely delayed gastric emptying before
   operation. Gastric emptying remained delayed in the ten patients who
   underwent an early postoperative gastric emptying study. Six of seven
   patients assessed at 1 year had improved gastric emptying, of whom four
   had returned to normal. Functional outcome did not relate to gastric
   emptying.
   Conclusion: Patients with ISTC have delayed gastric emptying. In some
   patients this returns to normal after colectomy, but is persistent in
   others. This may have implications for our understanding of ISTC.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To compare surface and intramuscular laryngeal electromyography
   (EMG) with adductor pollicis muscle EMG after 0.1 mg.kg(-1)
   cisatracunium.
   Methods: This prospective study included ten patients undergoing surgery
   with risk of damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN), The tracheas
   were intubated after fentanyl/propoiol without the aid of muscle
   relaxation. A surface laryngeal electrode was attached to the tube and
   placed amidst the vocal cords; two straight needles were inserted
   endoscopically into the lek lateral cricoarytenoid muscle. Single twitch
   stimulation of the left RLN (0.1 Hz) was performed transcutaneously;
   skin EMG of the left adductor pollicis muscle was performed at 0.1 Hz.
   After supramaximal stimulation for 10 min, 0.1 mg.kg(-1) cisatracurium
   was injected. Lag, onset time and peak effect were measured and
   compared.
   Results: Good correlation (r = 0.9, 0.8, p < 0.005) and good
   comparability of the two methods of laryngeal EMG (mean difference and
   limits of agreement: 0 +/- 28 sec for lag time, -2 +/- 84 sec for onset
   time) was shown, The mean surface laryngeal lag and onset times were 67
   +/- 22 sec and 198 +/- 72 sec, compared with the adductor pollicis
   muscle (98 +/- 30 sec and 242 +/- 59 sec) at P < 0.01. Peak effects at

Abstract = {{A one-dimensional model of meridional water vapor transport is used to
   evaluate the factors that control the spatial and temporal variations of
   oxygen (delta(18)O) and hydrogen (delta D) isotopic ratios in global
   precipitation. The model extends Rayleigh descriptions of isotopes in
   precipitation by including (1) effects of recharge to air masses by
   evaporation and (2) horizontal transport by both eddy fluxes and
   advection. Globally, spatial variations in precipitation delta(18)O and
   delta D depend on the ratio of evaporation to the product of horizontal
   moisture flux and horizontal temperature gradient. At low latitudes,
   where this ratio is large, precipitation delta(18)O and delta D are
   closely tied to the isotopic ratios of oceanic evaporation. At high
   latitudes the ratio is small, and delta(18)O and delta D are controlled
   by the ratio of advective transport to eddy transport. Transport by eddy
   fluxes induces less fractionation than transport by advection, resulting
   in a smaller gradient of isotopic ratios with temperature. The
   model-predicted temporal relationships between delta(18)O (or delta D)
   ofantarctic precipitation and temperature do not necessarily coincide
   with the modern spatial relationship and depend strongly on the
   proximity of the precipitation site to the ocean evaporation source.
   Sensitivity of delta(18)O to temporal changes in local surface
   temperature is low at coastal sites and increases with distance inland.
   These results suggest a possible explanation of the apparent discrepancy
   between borehole temperature inversion estimates of glacial temperatures
   and temperatures inferred from the modern spatial delta(18)O - surface
   temperature relationship.}},

   the influence of radiative transfer on the population structure. We find
   that in normal HII regions no strong maser activity occurs, while for
   ultra compact pact HII regions in a certain parameter range strong
   hydrogen masers should be found. Our fit to the available observational
   data for MWC 349 leads to a density estimate that is compatible with

   level of the Boltzmann equation. The charge separation that accompanies

   a damping of these waves due to phonon-assisted carrier redistributions.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Phase II studies have shown primary (neo-adjuvant)
   chemotherapy with bleomycin, ifosfamide and cisplatin (BIP) is active
   against inoperable cervical cancer. We present here results of a
   randomised phase III multicentre trial comparing radical radiotherapy
   with neo-adjuvant BIP chemotherapy followed by radical radiotherapy in
   patients with inoperable cervical cancer, designed to discover whether
   this combination might improve survival.
   Patients and methods: Patients with inoperable cervical carcinoma were
   randomised to pelvic radiotherapy alone {[}RT] or two to three cycles of
   bleomycin 30 units/24-hour infusion, ifosfamide 5 g/m(2)/24 hours, and
   cisplatin 50 mg/m(2)) chemotherapy followed by pelvic radiotherapy (BIP
   + RT). Randomisation was stratified by stage and radiotherapy centre.
   Results: One hundred seventy-two eligible women were randomised into
   this trial; eighty-six to RT and eighty-six to BIP + RT. A total of 190
   cycles of chemotherapy were given. Median follow-up for the 47 patients
   still alive is 9 years with a minimum follow-up of 3 years. Complete or
   partial response occurred in 51 of 86 (59\%) of those randomised to RT
   and 60 of 86 (69\%) of those randomised to BIP + RT. The difference
   between response rates does not reach statistical significance (chi(2) =
   2.06, P = 0.15). Median survival is two years with an actuarial survival
   at five years of 32\% (95\% confidence interval (95\% CI): 25\%-39\%).
   There is no significant difference between the treatment groups
   (chi(log-rank)(2) = 0.11, P = 0.74).
   Conclusions: This study does not show any survival benefit from the use
   of neo-adjuvant BIP chemotherapy in advanced cervical cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Drug-induced lupus erythematosus is a serious side effect of
   certain medications, such as procainamide, quinidine, hydralazine,
   chlorpromazine, and isoniazid, the underlying pathogenesis of which is
   unresolved. In this study, we examined the influence of these drugs on
   the regulation of apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in quiescent and
   activated human lymphocytes, We also discuss the dysregulation of
   apoptosis as a pathogenetic factor in systemic lupus erythematosus.
   Methods. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells or activated lymphoblasts
   from normal donors were incubated with different concentrations of each
   of the above-mentioned drugs.
   Results. We did not find induction of apoptosis in quiescent cells over
   a broad concentration range. In contrast, lymphoblasts readily underwent
   apoptosis when cultured with chlorpromazine, but not any of the other
   drugs, after stimulation with interleukin-2 (IL-2) in a dose-, time- and
   cell cycle-dependent manner. By several lines of evidence, toxicity was
   ruled out. Characteristic features of apoptosis-like incorporation of
   propidium iodide (PI), such as increased annexin V binding, changes in
   mitochondrial membrane potential, and induction of DNA breaks (as
   evidenced by TUNEL techniques), could be induced in lymphoblasts after
   chlorpromazine treatment. Chlorpromazine did not cause apoptosis: by
   inhibition of cytokine binding or blockade of early intracellular
   signaling. The protease inhibitor Z-VAD and the ceramide inhibitor
   sphingosine 1-phosphate effectively blocked chlorpromazine-induced
   apoptosis (by PI staining and by externalization of phosphatidylserine),
   in contrast to the caspase 3/CPP32 inhibitor DEVD, which had only minor
   effects. Western blot analysis revealed IL-2-mediated phosphorylation of
   extracellular signal-regulated kinase, which was sensitive to
   chlorpromazine. Using lymphoblasts from a patient with Canale-Smith
   syndrome, we found that chlorpromazine-mediated apoptosis is Fas/ APO-1
   independent.
   Conclusion. These data suggest that chlorpromazine mediates apoptosis in
   human lymphoblasts through specific activation of intracellular
   proapoptotic signaling cascades. This mechanism might lead to an
   unsynchronized inflow of apoptotic break-down products and thereby to
   the induction of (auto)immunity against nuclear components.}},

Abstract = {{The purposes of this study were to evaluate the usefulness of
   thin-section 3-dimensional Fourier Transform (3DFT) gradient echo
   imaging of the medial collateral ligament and to evaluate the usefulness
   of intraarticular gadolinium For the detection of tears of the ligament.
   Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 5 fresh-frozen cadaveric
   elbows through use of TI -weighted and 3DFT gradient echo T2-weighted
   sequences. The elbows were then arthroscoped, and lesions were created
   in the medial collateral ligaments. Magnetic resonance imaging was then
   repeated with the TI and 3DET sequences. In addition, dilute gadolinium
   was then injected intraarticularly, and fat-suppressed TI -weighted
   images and 3DFT images were obtained. Magnetic resonance imaging
   findings were correlated with the appearance of the dissected ligament.
   We found that in the prearthroscopy specimens, the ligament was best
   seen on the 3DFT images reformatted into a slightly posteriorly obliqued
   coronal plane. In the postarthroscopy elbows, 4 full-thickness
   perforations were detected with the 3DFT sequence; fat-suppressed T1
   -weighted images with intraarticular gadolinium detected these 4 as well
   as I partial inner surface tear. In conclusion, fat-suppressed
   TI-weighted magnetic resonance arthrography with gadolinium can provide
   information regarding inner surface partial tears and small
   full-thickness perforations.}},

Abstract = {{Background A long course of the initial prednisolone therapy has been
   shown to be more effective than standard-course therapy in reducing
   relapse rates in children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, but it is
   commonly accompanied by corticosteroid toxicities. There has been no
   study on prednisolone dosage for the effective treatment of nephrotic
   syndrome.
   Methods. Sixty-eight children (42 boys and 26 girls) with an initial
   attack of nephrotic syndrome were randomly allocated into two different
   long-course treatment groups. Patients in Group 1 received a daily
   prednisolone dose of 60 mg/m(2) for six weeks, followed by an
   alternate-day dose of 40 mg/m(2) for six weeks. Patients in Group 2 had
   a daily dose of 40 mg/m(2) instead of 60 mg/m(2).
   Results. Four children in each group did not respond within six weeks.
   Group 1 was associated with a significantly earlier response but more
   frequent corticosteroid toxicities than Group 2. Boys in Group 1 had a
   higher rate of sustained remission than boys in Group 2 (P = 0.0073),
   especially boys four years old or more (P = 0.0027), but girls did not
   show a significant difference (P = 0.863). Boys four years old or more
   in Group 1 had a course of frequent relapsing less often than those in
   Group 2 (2 of 13 vs. 6 of 8, P = 0.0075).
   Conclusion. These findings indicate that efficient prednisolone doses
   may vary between sexes and ages, and that a higher initial prednisolone
   therapy may be of greater benefit to older boys.}},

Abstract = {{One possible explanation for the differences in the prevalence of atopic
   sensitization between children from East and West Germany could be
   differences in the exposure to indoor allergens. This study examined
   whether pets were kept less frequently in households of children (5 - 7
   and 9 - 11 years old) in Dresden than in Munich and whether there were
   differences in indoor concentrations of mite and cat allergens. We
   analysed questionnaire data from 6317 German children in Dresden and
   4777 children in Munich and investigated allergen levels in 296 homes in
   Dresden and 297 homes in Munich. Cats and dogs were kept less frequently
   in Dresden than in Munich before 1990 as well as after 1990. In
   contrast, only small differences were found for smaller pets. Guinea
   pigs were kept more frequently in Dresden before and after 1990.
   Petkeeping increased between 1986 and 1996 in both cities. This trend
   was more pronounced in Dresden. The sum of house dust mite group 1
   allergens (Derp 1 + Der f 1) did not differ significantly in Dresden
   {[}geometric mean (GM) 2, 19, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1,54-3,10 mu
   g/g dust] and Munich (GM 2,46, 95\% CI 1,78-3,39 mu g/g dust). In
   contrast, a lower concentration of the cat allergen Fel d 1 was found in
   Dresden (GM 26, 95\% CI 19-36 ng/g dust) compared to Munich (GM 118,
   95\% CI 85-164 ng/g dust, p < 0,0001, Mann-Whitney U-test). Considering
   the results of other investigators these data suggest that cat allergen
   exposure was lower in East German than in West German homes whereas mite
   allergen concentrations vary substantially within both regions and do
   not differ consistently between East and West Germany.}},

   was re-tested on four occasions at least 1 week apart. The results were

   found considerable variation in the probabilities assigned to many
   commonly used expressions between subjects, and between repeated testing
   of the same subject. Some expressions were rated much more consistently
   than others. ``Absent{''}, ``excludes{''}, ``unlikely{''},
   ``probable{''}, ``certain{''} and ``definite{''} were the most

   superoxide generated in the reaction of xanthine oxidase with
   acetaldehyde is much higher (up to a factor of 6) when measured with TNM
   and compared with Fe-III cc. It is shown that Fe-III cc measures
   superoxide that has diffused from the enzyme, and that TNM probably
   scavenges all the dioxygen that is reduced by one electron by the
   enzyme. The TNM traps enzyme-bound superoxide in competition with the
   second-electron transfer and proton transfer, which normally yield
   hydrogen peroxide. The proton transfer is probably rate determining,

   that ecology and environmentalism may be fundamentally different from

Title = {{Role played by sodium in activity-dependent secretion of neurotrophins -
   revisited}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{3096-3106}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In previous experiments, a causal relationship between sodium influx and
   secretion of nerve growth factor (NGF) was deduced from the observation
   that the sodium substitute N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG) abolished any
   activity-mediated NGF secretion that depends on intact internal calcium
   stores. However, all available experimental evidence speaks against
   sodium-mediated calcium mobilization from these stores under
   physiological conditions. We now report that rapid sodium influx
   initiated by monensin or ouabain did not induce brain-derived
   neurotrophic factor (BDNF) secretion from either native hippocampal
   slices or BDNF-transduced hippocampal neuronal cultures. Additionally,
   we found marked differences between the replacement of sodium by NMDG
   and sucrose on the one hand, and choline and lithium on the other.
   Replacement of 100\% (and as little as 10\%) sodium by NMDG or sucrose
   not only blocked the activity-mediated neurotrophin secretion, but
   itself led to a rapid and substantial increase of neurotrophin
   secretion. In contrast, the replacement of sodium (10\% and 100\%) by
   lithium and choline did not result in a release of neurotrophins, and
   only 100\% replacement blocked the activity-mediated neurotrophin
   secretion. We conclude that the blocking effects of NMDG and sucrose on
   neurotrophin secretion do not reflect the sodium replacement, but
   instead represent an independent blocking effect. These differences were
   also reflected in part by electrophysiological investigations in
   individually patched hippocampal neurons. The importance of the present
   observations lies not only in the reevaluation of the involvement of
   sodium in activity-dependent neurotrophin secretion, but also in the
   demonstration that sodium replacement may initiate `side effects' that
   are unrelated to sodium replacement.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Because coagulatory activation in sepsis is triggered mainly
   by tissue factor release from endothelial cells and blood monocytes
   during their activation via proinflammatory cytokines, inhibition of
   coagulation by exogenous administration of coagulation inhibitors has
   been proposed. These strategies should allow us to prevent and treat
   excessive coagulatory activation, thereby potentially preventing
   sepsis-induced organ dysfunction. Potential therapies include the
   natural coagulation inhibitors antithrombin, activated protein C, and
   tissue factor pathway inhibitor, as well as direct thrombin inhibition
   by recombinant hirudin.
   Data Sources: A limited review of the published literature using all
   sources was undertaken.
   Study Selection: Selected clinical and experimental studies with
   coagulatory inhibitors were analyzed.
   Conclusions:The biological properties of coagulatory activation during
   sepsis (coagulation as a protective mechanism to control the septic
   focus, e.g., fibrin deposition during peritonitis) are not completely
   understood. Therefore, one has to be careful when administering
   coagulatory inhibitors, especially because patients with multiple organ
   dysfunction syndrome often do not show the widespread fibrin deposition
   in nutritive blood vessels that have been seen experimentally. How might
   these patients benefit from thrombin inhibition? Coagulatory activation
   per se seems unlikely to directly cause deterioration of organ function,
   although it is involved in generalized endothelial activation with
   consecutive mediator release and increased leukocyte-endothelial cell
   interaction. Antagonism of inflammatory mediators and, consecutively,
   endothelial cell activation might be a better target in adjunctive
   sepsis therapy, with improvement in septic microcirculatory
   disturbances. Administration of natural pleiotropic coagulation
   inhibitors that are documented positive effects on the microcirculation,
   (such as activated protein C, antithrombin) seems to be promising.}},

Abstract = {{Meniscal injury has been well documented in association with injury to
   the anterior cruciate ligament. The purpose of this study was to
   evaluate the effect of anterior cruciate ligament transection and
   reconstruction on meniscal strain. Four differential variable reluctance
   transducer strain gauges were placed in the medial and lateral menisci
   of nine cadaveric knees. Each specimen was mounted to a
   six-degree-of-freedom knee testing device. Testing was conducted with
   the knee fully extended and at 45 degrees and 90 degrees of flexion,
   both with and without applied axial load. At each angle of flexion, an
   anterior and posterior tibial load was applied. Next, the anterior
   cruciate ligament was transected and the testing sequence was repeated.
   Finally, the ligament was reconstructed using a central one-third
   patellar tendon graft and the testing sequence was repeated. The results
   demonstrated statistically significant increases in meniscal strain in
   ligament-transected knees compared with intact specimens. A reduction in
   meniscal strain to a level similar to that detected in the
   ligament-intact knees was observed after anterior cruciate ligament
   reconstruction, These results have important clinical implications
   regarding the potentially deleterious effect of the anterior cruciate
   ligament-deficient knee on meniscal strain and the potential benefit of
   anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.}},

Abstract = {{The Millstone Hill Incoherent Scatter Data Acquisition System (MIDAS) is
   based on an abstract model of an incoherent scatter radar. This model is
   implemented in a hierarchical software system, which serves to isolate
   hardware and low-level software implementation details from higher
   levels of the system. Inherent in this is the idea that implementation
   details can easily be changed in response to technological advances.
   MIDAS is an evolutionary system, and the MIDAS hardware has, in fact,
   evolved while the basic software model has remained unchanged. From the
   earliest days of MIDAS, it was realized that some functions implemented
   in specialized hardware might eventually be implemented by software in a
   general-purpose computer. MIDAS-W is the realization of this concept.
   The core component of MIDAS-W is a Sun Microsystems UltraSparc 10
   workstation equipped with an Ultrarad 1280 PCI bus analog to digital
   (A/D) converter board. In the current implementation, a 2.25 MHz
   intermediate frequency (IF) is bandpass sampled at 1 mu s intervals and
   these samples are multicast over a high-speed Ethernet which serves as a
   raw data bus. A second workstation receives the samples, converts them
   to filtered, decimated, complex baseband samples and computes the
   lag-profile matrix of the decimated samples. Overall performance is
   approximately ten times better than the previous MIDAS system, which
   utilizes a custom digital filtering module and array processor based
   correlator. A major advantage of MIDAS-W is its flexibility. A portable,
   single-workstation data acquisition system can be implemented by moving
   the software receiver and correlator programs to the workstation with
   the A/D converter. When the data samples are multicast, additional data
   processing systems, for example for raw data recording, can be
   implemented simply by adding another workstation with suitable software
   to the high-speed network. Testing of new data processing software is
   also greatly simplified, because a workstation with the new software can
   be added to the network without impacting the production system. MIDAS-W
   has been operated in parallel with the existing MIDAS-1 system to verify
   that incoherent scatter measurements by the two systems agree. MIDAS-W
   has also been used in a high-bandwidth mode to collect data on the
   November, 1999, Leonid meteor shower.}},

   brothers (B1-3) and their uncle, displaying strikingly different
   external genitalia: B1, ambiguous; B2, severe micropenis; B3, slight
   micropenis; and uncle, micropenis and penoscrotal hypospadias. All had
   been assigned a male gender. We detected the same L712F mutation of the
   androgen receptor (AR) gene in each subject. Methyltrienolone binding on
   cultured genital skin fibroblasts of B2 suggested moderate impairment of
   the ligand-binding domain {[}maximal binding capacity, 38.2 fmol/mg
   protein (normal); K-d, 0.21 nmol/L; normal range, 0.03-0.13 nmol/L]. In
   trans-activation assays, the mutant 712F-AR showed considerable
   deficiency at low concentrations of testosterone (0.01-0.1 nmol/L) or
   dihydrotestosterone (0.01 nmol/L). Remarkably, this could be fully
   neutralized by testosterone concentrations greater than 1.0 nmol/L.
   Hence, the 712F-AR could switch its function from subnormal to normal
   within the physiological concentration range of testosterone. This was
   reflected by an excellent response to testosterone therapy in B1, B2,
   and the uncle. Taking into account the well documented individual and
   time-dependent variation in testosterone concentration in early fetal
   development, our observations clearly illustrate the potential impact of
   varying ligand concentrations for distinct cases of phenotypic
   variability in androgen insensitivity syndrome.}},

Volume = {{79}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{There is now convincing evidence that the proteasome contributes to the
   generation of most of the peptides presented by major histocompatibility
   complex class I molecules. Here we present a model-based kinetic
   analysis of fragment patterns generated by the 20S proteasome from 20 to
   40 residues long oligomeric substrates. The model consists of ordinary
   first-order differential equations describing the time evolution of the
   average probabilities with which fragments can be generated from a given
   initial substrate. First-order rate laws are used to describe the
   cleavage of peptide bonds and the release of peptides from the interior
   of the proteasome to the external space. Numerical estimates for the 27
   unknown model parameters are determined across a set of five different
   proteins with known cleavage patterns. Testing the validity of the model
   by a jack knife procedure, about 80\% of the observed fragments can be
   correctly identified, whereas the abundance of false-positive
   classifications is below 10\%. From our theoretical approach, it is
   inferred that double-cleavage fragments of length 7-13 are predominantly
   cut out in ``C-N-order{''} in that the C-terminus is generated first.
   This is due to striking differences in the further processing of the two
   fragments generated by the first cleavage. The upstream fragment
   exhibits a pronounced tendency to escape from second cleavage as
   indicated by a large release rate and a monotone exponential decline of
   peptide bond accessibility with increasing distance from the first
   scissile bond, in contrast, the release rate of the downstream fragment
   is about tour orders of magnitude lower and the accessibility of peptide
   bonds shows a sharp peak in a distance of about nine residues from the
   first scissile bond. This finding strongly supports the idea that
   generation of fragments with well-defined lengths is favored in that
   temporary immobilization of the downstream fragment after the first
   cleavage renders it susceptible for a second cleavage.}},

Abstract = {{Assessing the activity of CYP3A4 is important for predicting the
   pharmacokinetic behavior of protease inhibitors in HIV positive
   patients, especially in pregnant women. The endogenous hormonal ratio of
   6 beta-hydroxycortisol (6 beta-OHF) to cortisol (F) in the urine is an
   index for metabolic enzyme activity of cytochrome p-450 (CYP) 3A4.
   Because the ratio is a unique way to assess the enzyme activity without
   using any exogenous probes for this isozyme, it is practical for use in
   pregnant women. In this paper, we describe a method using high
   performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for 6 beta-OHF in urine from
   pregnant women to estimate the ratio of 6 beta-OHF/F. Urinary 6 beta-OHF
   was measured by using Cls-cartridge solid phase extraction and isocratic
   HPLC. Aliquots (1 ml) of urine samples spiked with internal standard, 6
   beta-hydroxyprednisolone (6 beta-OHPSL), were alkalinized with NaOH,
   then applied to Gig-cartridges, which were washed with water and hexane
   and eluted with ethyl acetate. After the effluents were dried and
   reconstituted in 10\% acetonitrile, the samples were analyzed by HPLC
   using an isocratic mobile phase (acetic acid/acetonitrile/50 mM
   potassium dihydrogenphosphate; 0.2/9/90.8; v/v) and ultraviolet
   detection at 245 nm. The recoveries of 6 beta-OHF from C18 cartridges
   were 93.2 and 93.9\% when the authentic 6 beta-OHF was added to the
   urine sample at the concentration of 50 and 300 ng/ml, respectively.
   Intra- and inter-day variations estimated at concentrations of 113-674
   ng/ml were 2.9-5.6 and 4.9-8.1\%, respectively. The method was applied
   to morning urine samples collected from HIV-positive pregnant women
   managed with protease inhibitor containing anti-retroviral regimens. (C)

Abstract = {{Most existing efforts in image and video compression have focused on
   developing methods to minimize not perceptual but rather mathematically
   tractable, easy to measure, distortion metrics, While nonperceptual
   distortion measures were found to be reasonably reliable for higher bit
   rates (high-quality applications), they do not correlate well with the
   perceived quality at lower bit rates and they fail to guarantee
   preservation of important perceptual qualities in the reconstructed
   images despite the potential for a good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
   This paper presents a perceptual-based image coder, which discriminates
   between image components based on their perceptual relevance for
   achieving increased performance in terms of quality and bit rate. The
   new coder is based on a locally adaptive perceptual quantization scheme
   for compressing the visual data. Our strategy is to exploit human visual
   masking properties by deriving visual masking thresholds in a locally
   adaptive fashion based on a subband decomposition. The derived masking
   thresholds are used in controlling the quantization stage by adapting
   the quantizer reconstruction levels to the local amount of masking
   present at the level of each subband transform coefficient. Compared to
   the existing non Locally adaptive perceptual quantization methods, the
   new locally adaptive algorithm exhibits superior performance and does
   not require additional side information. This is accomplished by
   estimating the amount of available masking from the already quantized
   data and linear prediction of the coefficient under consideration, By
   virtue of the local adaptation, the proposed quantization scheme is able
   to remove a large amount of perceptually redundant information. Since
   the algorithm does not require additional side information, it yields a
   low entropy representation of the image and is well suited for
   perceptually lossless image compression.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To compare changes in the magnitude of soleus motoneuron
   excitability before and over a 4-hour period following artificial knee
   effusion.
   Design: Before-after trial.
   Setting: All measurements were collected in the Sports Injury Research
   Laboratory, Indiana State University.
   Participants: Eleven healthy and neurologically sound volunteers (mean
   age +/- SD, 24 +/- 3yr; height, 173.2 +/- 9.6m; weight, 72.9 +/- 8.7kg)
   with no history of lower-extremity surgery and no lower extremity
   pathology in the last year.
   Interventions: An area superolateral to the patella was cleaned and
   injected subcutaneously with 2mL of lidocaine for anesthetic purposes.
   With a second disposable syringe, 25mL of sterile saline was injected
   through the superolateral knee joint capsule into the joint space to
   mimic mechanical joint effusion.
   Main Outcome Measure: Hoffmann's reflex (H-reflex) was elicited by
   applying a percutaneous stimulus to the tibial nerve in the popliteal
   fossa. Seven to 12 stimuli were delivered at 20-second intervals with
   varying intensities to find the maximal H-reflex. The maximal H-reflex
   was measured five times at the same stimulus intensity with 20-second
   rest intervals. This measurement was recorded before injection and at
   1-hour intervals following the injection for 4 hours.
   Results: An overall difference between groups was found. Measurements
   from hours 3 and 4 were significantly higher than the preinjection
   measurements (p less than or equal to .05).
   Conclusions: The soleus motoneuron pool was not inhibited as expected.
   The soleus was facilitated beyond the preinjection level, showing that
   the quadriceps and soleus do not respond in the same way to artificial
   knee effusion. Because the quadriceps are normally inhibited during knee
   effusion, this facilitation could be the result of a compensatory
   reaction by the soleus in response to inhibited quadriceps. Further
   studies must be performed to determine the extent and duration of soleus
   motoneuron pool excitability in relation to quadriceps inhibition
   elicited by artificial knee effusion.}},

Abstract = {{Human chromosome 11p15,5 harbors an intriguing imprinted gene cluster of
   1 Mb, This imprinted domain is implicated in a wide variety of
   malignancies and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), Recently, several
   lines of evidence have suggested that the BWS-associated imprinting
   cluster consists of separate chromosomal domains. We have previously
   identified LIT1, a paternally expressed antisense RNA within the KvLQT1
   locus through a positional screening approach using human
   monochromosomal hybrids. KVLQTI encompasses the translocation breakpoint
   cluster in BWS and patients exhibit frequent loss of maternal
   methylation at the LIT1 CpG island, implying a regulatory role for the
   LIT1 locus in coordinate control of the imprinting cluster, Here we
   generated modified human chromosomes carrying a targeted deletion of the
   LIT1 CpG island using recombination-proficient chicken DT40 cells.
   Consistent with the prediction, this mutation abolished LIT1 expression
   on the paternal chromosome, accompanied by activation of the normally
   silent paternal alleles of multiple imprinted loci at the centromeric
   domain including KVLQTI and p57(KIP2). The deletion had no effect on
   imprinting of H19 located at the telomeric end of the cluster. Our
   findings demonstrate that the LIT1 CPG island can act as a negative
   regulator in cis for coordinate imprinting at the centromeric domain,
   thereby suggesting a role for the LIT1 locus in a BWS pathway leading to
   functional inactivation of p57(KIP2). Thus, the targeting and precise
   modification of human chromosomal alleles using the DT40 cell shuttle
   system can be used to define regulatory elements that confer long-range
   control of gene activity within chromosomal domains.}},

Abstract = {{Here we present a new approach to analyse dynamic models. It is based on
   the H-principle of mathematical modelling. The key issue is to identify
   the covariance matrices involved and solve the set of equations by
   steps, where at each step we optimize the selection of the covariance.
   The advantage of the procedure is that updating of model estimates in
   linear least squares, biased estimation and Kalman filtering can be
   achieved in a stable and secure manner. It implies that e.g. Kalman
   filtering can be carried out for hundreds or thousands of variables. The
   solution obtained at each time step provides the optimal balance between
   the prediction and the estimation aspect of the model. The developed
   procedures have several advantages over traditional methods: we do not
   have initial conditions that are difficult to estimate; it is easy to
   find influential variables; and it is easy to carry out sensitivity
   tests and others. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{White-crowned sparrows learn and produce multiple song types as
   juveniles, but most individuals stop singing all except one by the end
   of the first singing season. This single song type is generally
   maintained throughout adulthood. We demonstrate that, at the start of
   the second and subsequent singing seasons, this species can recall songs
   that had been deleted during the first singing season. The re-expression
   of song occurred in both the oriantha and the gambelii subspecies.
   Although all our males recrystallized the original song in the second
   year, our results indicate a mechanism for seasonal song change without
   new song memorization. The traditional dichotomy of closed-ended versus
   open-ended learning is inadequate for birds that learn early in life but
   can change their song output seasonally We suggest that species can
   exhibit a closed sensitive period for song memorization and first
   production, with the ability to recall deleted songs later in life. This
   type of learning, selective attrition followed by subsequent
   re-expression, may be used by some species currently considered
   open-ended learners. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{Introduction In response to Tomorrow's Doctors, the use of primary care
   as a teaching base has been extended in many medical curricula. Previous
   reports have largely been speculative, looking at the theoretical
   possibilities and concerns of general practitioner teachers; in order to
   validate such studies, it is now important to evaluate the experience of
   those actually engaged in new teaching opportunities. In addition,
   curriculum developers need to go beyond descriptive studies to weight
   the factors which may help or hinder new teaching.
   Aim The aim of this qualitative study was to use the context of a
   substantive increase in community-based teaching to evaluate the
   perspective of key general practice tutors on factors related to
   recruitment and retention, impact and outcomes, curriculum delivery,
   training and support, and quality assurance of the course.
   Methods Data were collected by written questionnaires to a sample of 45
   general practitioners, plus semi-structured interviews with 15 general
   practitioners (33\% of total sample). The data were purposively analysed
   to seek key factors, which were weighted by `force field' analysis to
   show the balance of positive and negative factors.
   Results The data demonstrate important factors which may facilitate or
   impair community-based teaching at the levels of tutor, student,
   practice, and academic context.
   Discussion A `cycle of satisfaction' is described, where personal
   motivation, shared team responsibility for teaching, and an enhanced
   professional self-image may all be crucial interdependent contributors.
   Suggestions are drawn from the data on key elements of effective
   academic support and possible practical quality indicators.}},

   perturbations with wavelengths of the same order as the mesh resolution.
   When a shock propagates through the interface, these perturbations can
   grow, severely contaminating the predicted interface development. Here
   an algorithm is presented which damps small-scare interface
   perturbations. A body force is applied at the interface which depends
   upon the disturbance amplitude and growth rate, and which resembles
   surface tension. Using this technique, qualitative improvements are
   obtained in Free-Lagrange simulations of single-mode Richtmyer-Meshkov
   instability. Growth rate behaviour and the evolution of the instability
   are seen to agree well with previously published results.}},

Abstract = {{Bradykinesia and rigidity are the symptoms that most directly correlate
   with loss of striatal dopamine in Parkinson's disease. In the
   hemiparkinsonian (HP) monkey, this is represented by paucity of movement
   as measured by computerized movement analysis, diminished manual
   dexterity on clinical examination, and diminished performance on operant
   behavioral tasks. The present study used an MPTP-induced HP model in
   rhesus monkeys to evaluate the effectiveness of adrenal medullary and
   peripheral nerve co-grafts in diminishing parkinsonian symptoms.
   Unoperated controls (N = 4), surgical controls with caudate lesioning (N
   = 4), and caudate co-grafted (N = 4) HP monkeys demonstrated diminished
   movement in the home cage following MPTP. This behavior persisted in
   unoperated controls: but improved in both surgical control and
   co-grafted monkeys. Functional hand dexterity evaluations demonstrated
   similar impairment in all three groups, but only surgical controls and
   co-grafted monkeys demonstrated improvement. In general, rotational
   behavior in response to apomorphine was consistent with recovery of
   function in surgical controls and cografted monkeys, but marked
   between-subject variability precluded group statistical analyses. None
   of the monkeys could perform the operant task using the affected limb
   following MPTP. However, the performance of two co-grafted animals
   demonstrated pal tial recovery. L-dopa improved operant performance,
   demonstrating a dopaminergic component to the task. The results
   demonstrate recovery of behavioral function after surgical treatment,
   with adrenal co-grafted monkeys showing the greatest degree of
   improvement.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most recent technical advancements in computed tomography
   (CT) is the introduction of multislice CT (MCT), Because multiple
   detector rows are used for data acquisition, MCT offers higher volume
   coverage, faster scan speed, and reduced X-ray tube loading. Recognizing
   its unique data-sampling pattern, several image reconstruction
   algorithms were developed, These algorithms have been shown to be
   adequate in producing clinically acceptable images.
   Recent studies, however, have revealed that the image quality of MCT can
   be significantly degraded when helical data are acquired with a tilted
   gantry, The degraded image quality has rendered this feature
   unacceptable for clinical usage. In this paper, we first present a
   detailed investigation on the cause of the image quality degradation. An
   analytical model is derived to provide a mathematical basis for
   correction. Several compensation schemes are subsequently presented, and
   a detailed performance comparison is provided in terms of spatial
   resolution, noise, computation efficiency, and image artifacts.}},

Abstract = {{Terminal-pair reliability (TR) in an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)
   Virtual path (VP) network corresponds to probabilistic quantification of
   robustness between two VP terminators, given the VP layout and the
   failure probabilities of physical links. Existing TR algorithms are
   shown to be unviable for ATM VP networks owing to either high
   complexities or failure dependency among VPs. The goal of the paper is
   to propose efficient algorithms for the computation of TR between two VP
   terminators by means of variants of path-based and cut-based partition
   methods which have been effectively used for the computation of TR in
   traditional networks. The first variant, called the path-based virtual
   path reliability (PVPR) algorithm, partitions the search space based on
   a physical path embedding the shortest route of VPs from the source
   terminator to the destination terminator. The second variant, called the
   cut-based Virtual path reliability (CVPR) algorithm, in lieu, performs
   the partition on the basis of a physical outset separating the source
   from the remaining terminators. In both algorithms, each subproblem is
   recursively processed by means of partition until the source and
   destination terminators are contracted or disconnected. Experimental
   results demonstrate that, compared to one promising TR algorithm (called
   EBRM), both the PVPR and CVPR algorithms improve the running time by
   five orders of magnitude. In particular, the CVPR outperforms EBRM more
   than PVPR does in terms of computation time. The two algorithms and
   their promising results consequently facilitate the real-time
   computation of the reliability or robustness of ATM VP networks. (C)

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial
   effect of Coptidis Rhizoma (CR), a traditional medicinal plant, on oral
   bacteria.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: CR extract was prepared by boiling CR in water
   for 2 h, Alkaloids contained in CR extract were assayed by high
   performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), Antibacterial activity of CR
   extract was estimated from the lowest concentration that did not permit
   bacterial growth (minimum inhibitory concentration, MIG) and the
   concentrations that inhibited 50\% of bacterial proteolytic activity
   (IC50),
   RESULTS: CR extract inhibited the growth of Actinomyces naeslundii,
   Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedio, Prevotella nigrescens
   and Actinobocillus actinomycetemcomitans at MIC of 0.031-0.25 mg ml(-1),
   whereas it had less inhibitory effect (MIC: 0.5-2 mg ml(-1)) on the
   growth of Streptococcus and Lactobacillus, The major active component of
   CR extract was berberine (Ber), an alkaloid, and its inhibiting
   specificity to bacterial growth was similar to that of CR extract. CR
   extract and Ber were bacteriostatic at the MICs against most of the
   bacteria, and bacteriocidal at the concentrations higher than the MICs,
   Ber inhibited the activities of collagenase from P, gingivalis and A.
   actinomycetemcomitans.
   CONCLUSION: CR extract and Ber had an inhibitory effect on
   periodontopathogenic bacteria. These results suggest the possibility of
   their clinical application for the treatment of periodontal diseases.}},

   zinc-binding capacities of the mutant proteins were greatly impaired,
   ranging from 22 to 68\% of that of the wild type. We then recovered two
   mutant SeVs from cDNA, which have V-C341S and V-C365R mutations and
   represent maximal and minimal zinc-binding capacities among the
   corresponding mutant Fusion proteins, respectively. The mutant viruses
   showed viral protein synthesis and growth patterns similar to those of
   wild-type SeV in cultured cells. However, the mutant viruses were
   strongly attenuated in mice in a way similar to that of SeV V-Delta C,
   which has a truncated V protein lacking the cysteine-rich domain, by
   exhibiting earlier viral clearance from the mouse lung and less
   virulence to mice. We therefore conclude that the zinc-binding capacity
   of the V protein is involved in viral pathogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{Affective disorders, such as depression or mania, tend to be recurrent
   and progressive. Typically, disease patterns evolve from isolated
   episodes to rhythmic and finally accelerated ``chaotic{''} mood patterns
   during the longitudinal course. Concepts from dynamical systems have
   been considered to explain this progression. However, most natural
   systems are not only nonlinear but also affected by noise. For this
   reason it seems important to incorporate cooperative stochastic-dynamic
   effects into current conceptional models for the course and neurobiology
   of such disorders. We use a computational perspective and describe
   behaviors of a simple mathematical model which result from interactions
   between random and deterministic dynamics. In particular, we Focus on a
   scenario for illness progression that relies on noise enhancement of
   feedback instabilities. We suggest that noise amplification of
   subclinical neurobiological vulnerabilities could represent a relevant
   disease mechanism. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Race nonspecific resistance of barley against the barley powdery mildew
   fungus (Blumeria Graminis f.sp. Hordei, Speer, Bgh) is mediated by
   recessive mlo alleles and is controlled by at least two additional genes
   `required for mlo-specified disease resistance' (Ror1 and Ror2). The
   pathogenesis-related accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was
   comparatively analysed in a susceptible barley line (Hordeum vulgare L.
   Cv Ingrid, genotype Mlo Ror1, Ror2), a resistant Ingrid backcross line
   carrying the mutant allele mlo5 (BCIngrid-mlo5, genotype mlo5 Ror1
   Ror2), and in the moderately susceptible mutants A44 and A89 (genotypes
   mlo5 Ror1 ror2 and mlo5 ror1-2 Ror2, respectively). In situ localization
   of H2O2 was performed by microscopic detection of 3,3-diaminobenzidine
   (DAB) polymerization. In BCIngrid-mlo5, penetration resistance against
   Bgh attack was closely correlated to H2O2 accumulation in cytoplasmic
   aggregates and cell wall appositions beneath the appressorium. In
   contrast, H2O2 accumulation was almost completely absent in susceptible
   Ingrid. Lines with mutations in Ror genes showed less H2O2 accumulation
   beneath appressoria, but more interaction sites with whole cell H2O2
   accumulation and hypersensitive cell death response than resistant
   BCIngrid-mlo5. Thus, mutations in Ror1 or Ror2 genes influence the
   cellular pattern of H2O2 accumulation in mlo plants attacked by Bgh. The
   data support the hypothesis that H2O2 accumulation is involved in
   resistance to fungal penetration.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous hydrocarbon reservoirs originate from sediments deposited in
   deep water. This is why processes governing their settings have given
   rise to a growing interest, especially in the field of numerical
   simulation.
   Taking the problematic and constraints imposed by the geological data
   into account, the method that we have adopted to obtain a mathematical
   model for diluted and turbulent finite gravity flows is the following:
   the two-dimensional movement created by the instantaneous release of a
   finite volume of heavy fluid (suspension of sediment particles) into a
   lighter one (water), on variable slopes, is theoretically studied as a
   model for gravity flows.
   These flows develop a characteristic longitudinal structure, comparable
   to a deformable semi-lens, where the height is small relative to the
   length. This geometry is imposed on the gravity flow.
   Using the Boussinesq's approximation, the flow dynamics is supposed to
   be governed by a balance between gravity driving forces, inertia and
   turbulent friction. The study of the internal longitudinal flow velocity
   field allows a law of variation for the spreading velocity to be
   formulated. An equation, including effects of water incorporation at the
   suspension-ambient fluid interface, quantifies the variation of the
   total volume of the flow. Finally, a transport equation for the
   particles volume concentration is proposed assuming that:
   turbulence creates a uniform density distribution in the flow;
   particles are advected at the mean flow velocity;
   particles fall out or are eroded in the viscous sublayer of the flow.
   The coupled system of the non-linear differential equations obtained is
   solved numerically. The model is then validated by experimental
   small-scale models realized by Laval (1988). The comparison between
   theoretical predictions and experimental results shows good agreement.
   An analytical study of the system, by local analysis methods for long
   times, shows the evolution of solutions when taking new physical
   phenomena into account and the consistency of the obtained numerical
   solutions.
   The obtained model leads to very low computational rime on a
   microcomputer. Simple and complete, it constitutes a first step towards
   quantitative comprehension of the impact of external parameters-such as
   the nature and the amount of sediment supply and the geometry of the
   basil-on gravity flow dynamics and on the organization of subsequent
   depositional sequences (turbidites).}},

Abstract = {{The objective was to establish the selection criteria for the optimal
   management modalities for cerebral arteriovenous malformations. We
   analysed the complications and late outcomes in 348 consecutive cases
   (132 microsurgical resections, 202 stereotactic radiosurgeries, 8
   embolisations only, 6 combined treatments) managed at Yonsei University
   Hospital from 1988 to 1997. Files for all patients were analysed. The
   outcome was classified into good for the patients who returned to their
   previous job with or without neurological deficits, fair for the
   patients who were unable to return to work but performed daily
   activities independently with minor deficits, and poor for the patients
   who were performing dependent daily activities with major deficits. The
   outcome of microsurgery was considered good in 108 patients (81.8\%),
   fair in 18 (13.6\%), poor in 4 (3.1\%), and 2 (1.5\%) patients died.
   Initial insults and haemodynamic complications were the major cause of
   an unfavourable outcome. The cumulative occlusion rate of the nidus
   after radiosurgery was 10.2\% within 12 months, 75.3\% within 24 months,
   and 89.8\% within 36 months. Perilesional imaging changes with
   neurological deficits (4 permanent and 6 transient, 4.8\%) and
   haemorrhage (16 patients, 7.7\%) during the latent interval were the
   major cause of an unfavourable outcome (1 poor, 4 dead after
   radiosurgery). Postradiosurgery bleeding occurred frequently within 6
   months (6 patients), and between 13 and 24 months (8 patients). In
   conclusion, selection of treatment modality for cerebral AVMs depends on
   the preoperative evaluation of the risk/benefit ratio in each case.
   Microsurgical removal, which eliminates the risk of bleeding
   immediately, is preferred for lesions in non-eloquent areas.
   Radiosurgery is an effective treatment modality for small lesions in
   eloquent areas, but has a substantial risk of haemorrhage during the
   latency period. Results of this study suggest that microsurgical removal
   should be considered for lesions in Eloquent areas with high haemorrhage
   risk, such as prior haemorrhage, medium to large size lesion, and single
   deep venous drainage. (C) 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. A pilot Study of human neural retinal transplantation was
   undertaken to investigate three major issues: whether a safe surgical
   procedure could be devised for transplantation of neural retinal tissue
   into the subretinal space, whether the transplant would be accepted in
   the subretinal space, and whether an improvement in vision could be
   achieved.
   METHODS. Eight patients with bare light perception (LP) vision due to
   retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and one patient with bare LP vision due to
   advanced neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) received
   subretinal transplants of human fetal retinal microaggregate suspensions
   without postoperative systemic immunosuppression. The patient with AMD
   also received a fetal retinal sheet transplant. The ages of the patients
   ranged from 31 to 94 years (median, 55 years). The pre- and
   postoperative evaluations included visual function testing, detailed
   fundus examinations, fundus photography, fluorescein angiography.
   macular perimetry using a scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO), and full
   field and focal electroretinograms (ERGs).
   RESULTS. Three of the eight RP patients demonstrated possible improved
   light sensitivity during the initial months of follow-up. However,
   visual improvement disappeared between 3 and 13 months of follow-up.
   After transplantation, no subject showed any changes in the ERG
   recordings or SLO macular perimetry relative to their preoperative
   baseline. No patient experienced a retinal detachment, infection, or
   extensive bleeding. None of the patients developed retinal vasculitis or
   intraocular inflammation. In one RP patient, fluorescein angiography and
   fundus photography documented the formation and maturation of new host
   retinal vessels in the area of the transplant.
   CONCLUSIONS. Transplantation of fetal retinal photoreceptor suspensions
   into the subretinal space was achieved safely in nine subjects. Although
   a definite positive effect on visual function could not be demonstrated,
   the apparent high tolerance for graft tissue is promising fur future
   efforts in the field of neural retinal transplantation.}},

Abstract = {{The genus Dombeya is an important component of tropical forests in west
   Africa, Madagascar, and the Mascarene islands, bur little is known about
   the reproductive biology of its members. In this study, we quantified
   gender variation and flower-size variation in three populations of the
   dioecious tree Dombeya ciliata, an endemic of La Reunion Island (Indian
   Ocean). Variation among the three populations was observed for three
   characters. First, the high elevation population had strict males and
   females, whereas in the two low elevation populations, males were
   inconstant, with > 50 percent of the males set a small number of fruit.
   Second, females showed greater seed production at high elevation. Third,
   flower-size dimorphism was greater at high elevation because male
   flowers were larger than female flowers.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of the
   British adult population which appeared to achieve the national
   consumption guidelines for fruit and vegetable consumption and to
   compare their dietary, socioeconomic, demographic and behavioural
   characteristics with those of other British adults who did not comply
   with the guidelines. Methods: A representative national dietary survey
   using 7 day weighed records was employed. The sample was recruited using
   a multistage probability design. One thousand and eighty-seven men and
   1,110 women aged 16-64 years living in private households in Great
   Britain in 1986-1987 took part. The main outcomes were food group,
   nutrient consumption and socioeconomic, demographic and behavioural
   variables. Results: Forty per cent of men and 38\% of women were
   classified as fruit and vegetable compliers. By definition, compliers
   had higher fruit and vegetable intakes of 169 g for men and 193 g for
   women compared to 28 g for men non-compliers and 49 g for women
   non-compliers. Compliers had significantly higher intakes of 20 vitamins
   and minerals (p<0.001) compared to non-compliers. The majority of
   compliers came from social classes I, II and III non-manual. Nonsmoking
   was significantly associated with being a complier. Almost half of
   compliers lived in central and southern regions and one-third lived in
   northern regions and Scotland (p<0.001). Conclusion: The World Health
   Organisation supports the need for an increase in fruit and vegetable
   consumption to a daily intake of 400 g per person. To increase intake
   there is a need for targeting the young, lower social class and those
   living in the north and Scotland. The approach should take into account
   current consumption, access to fruit and vegetables and current
   attitudes.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanisms and dose-response of UV action on the early development
   of Macrocystis pyrifera (L.) C. Agardh gametophytes were investigated.
   Pest-release, zoospores undergo germination, germ tube elongation, DNA
   synthesis, nuclear division and translocation, which were followed for
   41 h under laboratory conditions. The spores were exposed to UV
   radiation before germination (3 h post-release) or before nuclear
   division (20 h post-release). Biologically effective UV-B doses
   (BEDDNA300 nm) higher than those used in the experiments are needed for
   a 50\% inhibition in germination (BED50 > 1600 J m(-2)), Nuclear
   division/translocation was more sensitive to UV radiation. When the
   spores were cultured in the dark, UV exposure at both 3 and 20 h
   post-release resulted in a dose-responsive inhibition of nuclear
   division/translocation (BED50 64 and 86 J m(-2)). Culturing in the light
   indicated recovery in the spores that were irradiated at 3 h
   post-release (BED50 356 J m(-2)), whereas no light-dependent recovery
   occurred within 41 h of culture when irradiated at 20 h post-release
   (BED50 80 J m(-2)). The results present a possible mechanism of UV
   inhibition in early life stages of the giant kelp, suggesting that
   environmentally relevant UV-B levels can perturb or delay the
   development and recruitment of the gametophytes by inhibiting nuclear
   events.}},

Abstract = {{The M=7.1 Hector Mine earthquake ruptured the Lavic Lake fault near

   for measuring the crustal deformation field around Los Angeles, CA, it
   was possible to determine the deformation associated with the earthquake
   with unprecedented speed and reliability. Thirty-four stations recorded
   displacements over the 3-sigma level. The displacements measured with
   GPS can be modeled by a fault 46.2 +/- 2.6 km long, 8.2 +/- 1.0 km wide,
   striking 330 degrees, dipping 84 degrees east, with 301 +/- 36 cm right
   lateral strike-slip, and 145 +/- 36 cm of east-up dip-slip, yielding a
   potency of 1.3 km(3) and geodetic moment of 3.8 x 10(26) dyne-cm. The

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the problems of robust stability analysis and

   plant is subjected to parametric variations in an m-dimensional
   ellipsoid (m-ellipsoid) E. It is shown that the problems can be solved
   in a unified framework of constructing the image or value set f(B) of an
   m-box B under a differentiable complex-valued mapping f. The value set
   f(B) is constructed through finding the set of the generalized
   principal-point (GPP) manifolds G of dimension one whose image f(G)
   converts the value-set boundary partial derivative f(B). The set G
   consists of connecting GPP manifolds, which have a connection with the
   edges of B, and isolated GPP manifolds which are closed curves on the
   open faces of B. The set of connecting GPP manifolds G(c) are traced out
   by a spherical algorithm such that the computed outer border of f(G(c))
   is epsilon-connected, i.e., the distance of the nearest neighbour is
   less than epsilon. This allows the isolated GPP manifolds whose images
   may have a substantial contribution to the value-set boundary partial
   derivative f(B) to be almost detected and then found.}},

Abstract = {{The canonical problem of the one-dimensional, pulsating, overdriven
   detonation wave has been studied for over 30 years, not only for its
   phenomenological relation to the evolution of multidimensional
   detonation instabilities, but also to provide a robust, reactive,
   high-speed flowfield with which to test numerical schemes. The present
   study examines this flowfield using high-order, essentially
   non-oscillatory schemes, systematically varying the level of resolution
   of the reaction zone, the size and retention of information in the
   computational domain, the initial conditions, and the order of the
   scheme. It is found that there can be profound differences in peak
   pressures as well as in the period of oscillation, not only for cases in
   which the reaction front is under-resolved, but for cases in which the
   computation is corrupted due to a too-small computational domain.
   Methods for estimating the required size of the computational domain to
   reduce costs while avoiding erroneous solutions are proposed and tested.}},

Abstract = {{The paper is concerned with a dynamic positioning control for a
   semisubmersible platform model against external forces such as ocean
   current, wind and waves. A dynamic positioning system using thrusters is
   generally employed to control a given position. In such a control, it is
   difficult for thrusters to resist the wave frequency motion because the
   linear exciting force is very strong. The purpose of the control is to
   maintain a given position using thrusters that do not respond to this
   force in the wave frequency range. The problem was formulated in a
   framework of H-infinity control, and a controller was designed using a
   linear mathematical model obtained from nonlinear motion equations of
   the platform. Model tests were carried out and the designed controller
   performed well. Model experiments were conducted in oblique incident
   waves, and some successful results are shown.}},

   create a nearby grid where the mesh cell edges are aligned with the
   IACs, On an aligned grid, numerical discretizations of partial
   differential equations can be formulated to satisfy the interfacial
   relations, such as matching fluxes across the discontinuity, to reduce
   the numerical errors introduced by the discontinuity. We present
   examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the IAC grid generation
   algorithm for multiple embedded interfaces in a quadrilateral grid. (C)

   protocol, but in addition to what PRMA++ provides, it introduces a
   flexible dynamic approach in the choice of the percentage of bandwidth
   to be used for reservation. Separation between reservation and
   information channels, along with dynamic adaptation of the percentage of
   reservation bandwidth within a frame to traffic condition, guarantee the
   required QoS to multimedia services, Results obtained show that the
   performance of D-RMA are superior when compared to a traditional

Journal = {{HYPERTENSION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{491-496}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Benidipine hydrochloride has been developed as an antagonist for the
   L-type calcium channel and is used as an anti-hypertensive drug. But
   recent studies have reported that benidipine exerts not only
   antihypertensive actions but also anti-hypertrophic actions on cardiac
   muscles. Endothelin-1 (ET-1), one of the endogenous pathological humoral
   factors of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and heart
   failure, has a strong vasoconstrictive action and could induce
   hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy. So, it is a matter of great
   interest whether or not calcium antagonists can decrease cardiac
   hypertrophy induced by the pathological vasoactive substances such as
   ET-1. Thus, the present study was designed to elucidate the effects of
   benidipine on cardiac hypertrophy, and particularly on the interaction
   with ET-1, using neonatal rat cardiac myocytes (MCs) and cardiac
   non-myocytes (NMCs) culture systems. Cells were cultured with or without
   ET-1, benidipine, and nifedipine and the effects of calcium antagonists
   on cardiac hypertrophy were evaluated by incorporations of {[}H-3]
   leucine and {[}H-3]-thymidine into MCs and/or NMCs, Benidipine
   significantly decreased the ET-1-induced increase of {[}H-3]-leucine and
   {[}H-3]-thymidine uptake into cardiac MCs and NMCs, whereas no
   significant effects of nifedipine were observed. Furthermore, benidipine
   (10(-8) M) attenuated ET-1 secretions from NMCs. In summary, benidipine
   at least partially decreased the cardiac hypertrophy induced by
   paracrine mechanisms through its attenuation of ET-1 secretions from
   NMCs, Benidipine could thus be a useful tool for preventing cardiac
   hypertrophy due to hypertension.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The effects of malnutrition on polymorphonuclear neutrophil
   (PMN) exudation are not well understood. The purpose of this study was
   to examine the effects of short-term dietary restriction on adhesion
   molecule expression on circulating PMNs and PMN exudation into the
   inflamed site in a glycogen-induced peritonitis model. Methods: Twelve
   mice were randomly assigned to one of two groups. The ad libitum and
   diet-restricted groups received mouse chow ad libitum (estimated
   consumption: 132 g/kg per day) and 33 g/kg per day, respectively, for 7
   clays. Then, 2 mi, of a 1\% glycogen solution was intraperitoneally
   administered to all mice. After 4 hours, the animals were killed. Whole
   blood was drawn by cardiac puncture. Peritoneal exudative cells were
   harvested by lavaging the peritoneal cavity. Expressions of CD11b, CD18,
   and CD62L were measured by flow cytometry. Results: Dietary restriction
   did not affect the numbers of circulating leukocytes, PMNs, or
   monocytes. However, CD11b and CD18 expressions on circulating PMNs were
   significantly lower in the diet-restricted than in the ad libitum group.
   In contrast, CD62L expression on circulating PMNs was not affected by
   dietary restriction. The number of exudative PMNs was significantly
   lower in the diet-restricted group than in the ad libitum group. The
   expressions of CD11b, CD18 and CD62L on exudative PMNs were unaffected
   by dietary restriction. There was a significant positive correlation
   between exudative PMN numbers and CD18 expression on circulating PMNs.
   Conclusions: Severe dietary restriction in our murine model decreased
   beta(2) integrin expression on circulating PMNs and inhibited PMN
   exudation into inflamed sites in the early phase of inflammation. These
   events may increase susceptibility to bacterial infection. Nutritional
   replenishment may improve host defense in part by enhancing PMN adhesion
   molecule expression.}},

Abstract = {{In a previous study, we described the development of a new specific
   serodiagnostic test for Lyme disease involving enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay and;I synthetic peptide, OspC-I. The OspC-I peptide
   is derived from part of thr outer surface protein C (OspC) amino acid
   sequence of Borrelia burgdorferi and is located in the region conserved
   among B. burgdorferi sensu strictu or sensu late isolates. In this
   study, Eve demonstrate that sera containing antibodies against OspC-I
   from patients with early Lyme disease had borreliacidal activity against
   isolates of three genospecies of Lyme disease spirochete, B. burgdorferi
   B31, B. garinii HPI and B. afzelii HT61. However, the borreliacidal
   activity against B. burgdorferi, which has not been isolated in Japan,
   was weaker than that against thr other species. Vaccination of mice with
   OspC-I induced the production of anti-OspC-I antibodies in serum with
   borreliacidal activity. The immune mouse serum had significantly higher
   levels of borreliacidal activity against HPL and HT61, than against B31.
   Neutralization of borreliacidal activity with anti-IgM antibodies showed
   that the borreliacidal activity of anti-OspC-I antibodies in serum was
   due to IgM. Furthermore, mice vaccinated with OspC-I were protected
   against challenge with HP1 and HT61, but not fully protected against
   infection with B31. These results suggest that OspC-I is not only a
   specific antigen for use in serodiagnostic tests for Lyme disease, but
   is also a potential candidate for a Lyme disease vaccine in Japan. (C)

Abstract = {{PURPOSE
   In a phase II trial of paclitaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil in
   metastatic esophageal cancer, we identified significant activity for the
   combination of agents, but there was severe associated toxicity. We
   therefore undertook a phase II trial of paclitaxel and cisplatin without
   fluorouracil.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS
   Thirty-eight patients with carcinoma of the esophagus or
   gastroesophageal junction were treated. No patient who underwent prior
   chemotherapy was allowed to take part in the study. The majority (33
   patients) had adenocarcinoma, and most (36 patients, 95\%) had
   metastatic disease. Paclitaxel, 200 to 250 mg/ m(2), was given by
   24-hour infusion on day 1, followed by cisplatin, 75 mg/m(2), on day 2,
   with granulocyte colony stimulating factor support. Treatment was cycled
   every 21 days in the outpatient setting. The first 16 patients received
   paclitaxel at 250 mg/m(2), but because of toxicity and treatment-related
   deaths, the dose was reduced to 200 mp/m(2).
   RESULTS
   Thirty-two patients were evaluable for response. Six patients were
   evaluated for toxicity after receiving only one cycle (due to toxicity
   or treatment-related death). Partial responses were seen in 14 patients
   (44\%); responses occurred in 13/28 patients with adenocarcinoma (46\%)
   and in one of four patients with squamous carcinoma (25\%). Median
   duration of response was 3.9 months, and median survival was 6.9 months.
   Of twenty-five patients with dysphagia before therapy, eighteen patients
   (72\%) had complete resolution of dysphagia, and two (8\%) had partial
   resolution. Toxicity included grade 3/4 fatigue in 35\% of patients and
   grade 4 neutropenia in 47\% of patients. Nineteen patients (50\%)
   required hospitalization for toxicity, and four patients (11\%) died
   from therapy-related complications.
   CONCLUSION
   The combination of paclitaxel and cisplatin has significant activity in
   esophageal adenocarcinoma. Because of hospitalization for toxicity and
   deaths resulting from treatment, the combination of paclitaxel and
   cisplatin used in this trial cannot be recommended. The optimal dose and
   schedule of paclitaxel/cisplatin combination therapy remain to be
   established.}},

   Applying iterative perturbation theory to the Hubbard interaction within
   dynamical mean field theory, we calculate the one-particle spectral

   approximation is further used to treat the ferromagnetic Hund coupling
   between conduction electrons and localized spins. Identifying the
   decrease of the magnetization for the localized spin with the increase
   of the temperature, we discuss the temperature dependence of the
   one-particle spectrum and the optical conductivity. It is found that the
   interplay between the Hund coupling and the Hubbard interaction
   dramatically changes the spectral function, while it is somehow obscured

Abstract = {{Four members of collapsin response mediator proteins (CRMPs) are thought
   to be involved in the semaphorin-induced growth cone collapse during
   neural development. Here we report the identification of a novel CRMPS
   associated protein, designated CRAM for CRMP3-associated molecule, that
   belongs to the unc-33 gene family. The deduced amino acid sequence
   reveals that the CRAM gene encodes a protein of 563 amino acids, shows
   57\% identity with dihydropyrimidinase, and shows 50-51\% identity with
   CRMPs. CRAM appears to form a large complex composed of CRMPS and other
   unidentified proteins in vivo. Indeed, CRAM physically associates with
   CRMPS when co-expressed in COS-7 cells. The expression of CRAM is
   brain-specific, is high in fetal and neonatal rat brain, and decreases
   to very low levels in adult brain. Moreover, CRAM expression is
   up-regulated during neuronal differentiation of embryonal carcinoma P19
   and PC12 cells. Finally, immunoprecipitation analysis of rat brain
   extracts shows that CRAM is co-immunoprecipitated with proteins that
   contain protein-tyrosine kinase activity, Taken together, our results
   suggest that CRAM, which interacts with CRMP3 and protein-tyrosine
   kinase(s), is a new member of an emerging family of molecules that
   potentially mediate signals involved in the guidance and outgrowth of
   axons.}},

Abstract = {{In myotonic dystrophy (DM), the expansion of CTG triplet repeats in the
   3'-untranslated region of DM-protein kinase (DMPK) is a causal gene
   mutation. However, the pathogenic molecular mechanism of CTG repeat
   expansion for DM phenotypic expression is unclear. To investigate this
   issue, we examined the influence of CTG repeat expansion on the
   expression levels of DMPK gene and 3'-flanking DM locus-associated
   homeodomain protein (DMAHP)/SIX5 gene in the muscles of DM patients. We
   isolated RNA from muscle tissues of six DM patients and six controls,
   and performed a competitive reverse transcriptional polymerase chain
   reaction (RT-PCR) assay. The total mRNA level of DMAHP/SIX5 was
   significantly lower in DM than in controls, but the DMPK mRNA level was
   unchanged. Our results suggest that CTG repeat expansion influences the
   expression of genes other than DMPK to cause the DM phenotype. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Background and Purpose-The arterial and venous blood concentration of
   technetium 99m-labeled hexamethylpropyl-eneamine oxime (Tc-99m-HMPAO)
   reaches an equilibration more rapidly than other CBF tracers. We
   hypothesized that Tc-99m radioactivity of a venous sample at
   equilibrium, which is similar to that of an arterial sample, would allow
   estimation of the integrated input function for the clinical measurement
   of CBF by use of single-photon emission CT.
   Methods-In 53 patients with stable cerebrovascular disease, the
   radioactivity of a venous sample 5 minutes after injection of
   Tc-99m-HMPAO was correlated with 5-minute arterial blood radioactivity
   and the first 5 minutes of the integrated arterial curves of the
   lipophilic tracer. The measured CBF values were compared with those of
   xenon 133.
   Results-The radioactivity of 5-minute venous blood was almost equivalent
   to that of 5-minute arterial blood (r(2)=0.987; y=0.993x+1.63;
   P<0.0001), The correlation between the venous blood radioactivity and
   the integrated arterial lipophilic fraction was excellent (r(2)=0.935,
   P<0.0001). A strong correlation was obtained between Tc-99m-HMPAO and
   Xe-133 CBF values (r(2)=0.825, P<0.0001), CBF values were reproducible
   (coefficient of variation, 8.6\%),
   Conclusions-This approach is fast, simple, and an alternative to
   continuous blood sampling in clinical quantitative Tc-99m-HMPAO CBF
   studies.}},

   Results. Children carrying the apo epsilon 2 allele (1 or 2 epsilon 2
   alleles; n = 45) had higher mean high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
   cholesterol level (49.5 +/- 13.0 vs 42.4 +/- 8.9 mg/dL) and lower mean

Abstract = {{The upper airway configuration significantly changes during the first

   of the pharyngeal airway. The present study evaluated developmental
   changes of passive pharyngeal mechanics in nine normal infants ranging
   in age from 2 to 12 mo. The static pressure-area relationship of the
   passive pharynx was quantified under general anesthesia with complete
   paralysis. We found a direct association between age and maximal
   velopharyngeal area (r = 0.840, p = 0.005). Velopharyngeal closing
   pressure progressively decreased with increasing age (r = -0.809, p =
   0.008) and the closing pressures were below atmospheric pressure in all
   infants (range: -0.7 to -9.8 cm H2O; mean +/- SD: -3.6 +/- 2.7 cm H2O).
   Shape of the pressure-area curves became steeper in slope with
   maturation, indicating increased pharyngeal wall stiffness during
   development. Accordingly, we conclude that anatomic properties of the
   pharynx gain stability in favor of maintaining patent airway during
   development in normal infants.}},

Abstract = {{The orange peel with enzymatic microbial additive. formic or acetic
   acids was ensiled for 70 days, in concrete tubes with 700 kg of volume
   capacity, was evaluated by rumen fermentation parameters in a
   experimental trial using males sheep, housed in metabolic cages. The
   used diet was oat hay (70\%) and orange silage (30\%) on DM base. The
   ruminal fluid was collected with esophageal tube at 2, 5 and 8 hours
   after, and before feeding that was taken as zero time (0). The pH, N
   ammonia, volatile fatty acids (acetic, propionic and butyric) and the
   energy contribution of these acid in kcal were evaluated. There were no
   differences among treatments for the evaluated characteristics. The
   regression equations presented quadratic behavior for ail studied
   characteristics and the averages of the characteristics were: pH, 6.97,
   N arnoniacal, 6.78 mg/100 mL of ruminal fluid and acetic, propionic and
   butyric acids values of 45.99, 11.16 and 5,50 mM/mL of ruminal fluid,
   respectively. The additives did not alter the nutritional value of the
   diet when evaluated by the rumen fermentation characteristics. However,
   for VFA production, there was a better energy conversion efficiency
   (kcal of VFA/kcal of glucose), 72.92\% for the control treatment
   (without additive).}},

   pyrimidine carboxylic acids (7a,b) and N omega phthaloyl
   2,omega-diaminoalkanoic acid methyl esters (6a-c) and subsequent

   (19a,b) derived from tert-butoxycarbonyl-ornithine analogs (17a,b). A

   analogs (9, 11, 21, 23, 25, 30, 36) exhibited much more potent

   particular, compounds 9c, 21k and 36a also showed remarkable
   growth-inhibitory activities against methotrexate-resistant CCRF-CEM
   cells. These results demonstrate that the potent inhibitory activities
   of N-omega-masked ornithine analogs against the growth of Meth A cells
   and methotrexate-resistant CCRF-CEM cells, results from effective uptake
   via reduced folate carrier and their potent DHFR inhibition.}},

Abstract = {{Instability of a non-parallel similar-boundary-layer flow to small and
   wavy disturbances is governed by partial differential equations with
   respect to the non-dimensional vertical coordinate zeta and the local
   Reynolds number R-1 based on chordwise velocity of external stream and a
   boundary-layer thickness. In the particular case of swept Hiemenz flow,
   the equations admit a series solution expanded in inverse powers of
   R-1(2) and then are decomposed into an infinite sequence of ordinary
   differential systems with the leading one posing an eigenvalue problem
   to determine the first approximation to the complex dispersion relation.
   Numerical estimation of the series solution indicates a much lower
   critical Reynolds number of the so-called oblique-wave instability than
   the classical value R-c = 583 of the spanwise-traveling
   Tollmien-Schlichting instability. Extension of the formulation to
   general Falkner-Skan-Cooke boundary layers is proposed in the form of a
   double power series with respect to 1/R-1(2) and a small parameter
   epsilon denoting the difference of the Falkner-Skan parameter m from the
   attachment-line value m = 1. (C) 2000 The Japan Society of Fluid

   obtain a composite membrane tube with as few defects as possible. Under
   optimum electroplating conditions, it was observed with SEM and FE-SEM
   that a thin layer of palladium formed with a thickness of several
   micrometers was densely packed inside the pores. The ideal separation

Abstract = {{Purpose: Soluble Fas antigen (sFas) and ligand (sFasL), which are
   associated with apoptosis, have not been evaluated in gastrointestinal
   or cerebrovascular surgery. The aim of this study was to measure these
   substances in serum, intra-abdominal fluid, or cerebrospinal fluid, and
   to speculate a pathophysiologic role for Fas-FasL apoptosis in surgery.
   Materials and Methods: Arterial blood and intraabdominal or
   cerebrospinal fluid were collected at intervals from 27 gastrointestinal
   surgical patients, 10 cerebrovascular surgical patients, and 10 spinal
   anesthesia patients.
   Results: Serum sFas levels did not change during and after surgery
   Intra-abdominal and cerebrospinal sFas levels were identical to and
   lower than those in serum. Serum sFasL levels did not change during
   surgery, but decreased after surgery. Intra-abdominal and cerebrospinal
   sFasL levels were higher than and identical to those in serum. In spinal
   anesthesia, cerebrospinal sFas and sFasL levels were lower than those in
   serum.
   Conclusions: Serum sFasL decreases after surgery, whereas
   intra-abdominal or cerebrospinal sFasL increases, although sFas in each
   site does not change, suggesting redistribution of activated lymphocytes
   into local surgical wounds and induction of apoptosis in this site.

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose a new class of optimization problems on
   oriented graphs with weight, which are called nearest route problems. A
   nearest problem has a target value, which generates an error function in
   a sense. Which route is nearest to the designated value? The nearest
   route problem includes both the shortest route problem and longest one.
   We give an invariant imbedding solution through both forward-backward
   and backward-forward approaches. A typical nearest problem is solved by
   both approaches. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{In laboratory usability studies, error collecting and analysis are
   frequently used methods of software evaluation and usually are capable
   of revealing the most conspicuous design deficiencies, if there are any.
   In certain cases, however, it is hard if not impossible to distinguish
   accidental user errors from systematic errors attributable to design
   failures without a careful statistical hypothesis testing. An
   appropriate, additional statistical analysis of the distribution of
   observed errors along the steps of the standard tasks could add further
   useful information to the obvious results of the study. For this purpose
   a simple binomial model is proposed, which proved to be applicable in a
   case study: by the help of this model it was possible to discover some
   further design failures in addition to the already obvious ones.}},

Abstract = {{A 28-year-old man was admitted to our department for investigation in
   1992. He presented with a red, scaly, centrifugally spreading eruption,
   which had appeared in 1990, beginning on the neck and thorax, and later
   extending to the trunk and limbs. The cutaneous lesions, located mainly
   on the trunk and proximal upper limbs, were arranged in rings, with a
   slightly raised prominent scaling edge (Fig. 1a). The characteristic
   feature was the presence of rings or waves within already existing
   rings, whereas the central part was flattened, with the texture of
   normal skin. The concentric figurate lesions resembled a wood grain
   pattern (Fig. 1b). The clinical picture was strikingly similar to tinea
   imbricata; there was, however, no itching, and repeated mycologic
   studies did not disclose Trichophyton concentricum.
   The histology was not characteristic. The epidermis, which was slightly
   edematous, was covered with a heavy crust. In the dermis, a sparse
   inflammatory infiltrate, somewhat more pronounced in the subpapillary
   areas, was composed of lymphocytes with some eosinophils. Periodic
   acid-Schiff (PAS) and other stains for mycotic infection were negative.
   The general condition was not affected and laboratory studies did not
   show any abnormalities, except for low serum protein (5.1 g/L) and
   decreased gamma globulins (10.5\%). Cell-mediated immunity was
   preserved. Immunofluorescence studies (direct and indirect) were
   negative.
   In spite of repeatedly negative mycotic examinations and due to the
   striking similarity to tinea imbricata, we applied various antimycotic
   therapies (terbinafine, itraconazole), with no effect. The figurate
   pattern, with normal skin in between, altered from day to day, while new
   concentric rings appeared within the cleared skin. The migrating rate
   was about 2-3 cm per 2 weeks. The patient had undergone a thorough
   search for internal malignancy. During the follow-up period of 1992-98,
   cutaneous involvement slowly became almost generalized (1996), and the
   confluent lesions formed large plaques, but still with pronounced
   concentric rings.
   Transitional blood eosinophilia (27\% in 1993 and 11\% in 1996)
   regressed with no therapy. Since 1995, antibodies to HBs and HBc have
   been present with no clinical symptoms of liver disease. The blood
   proteins increased to 7.0 g/L, and gamma globulins to 17.2\% (normal).
   The histology, studied repeatedly, started to display some signs of
   psoriasis from 1996 and, in 1998, was already consistent with the
   disease (Fig. 2). REPUVA (0.8 mg/kg acitretin and UVA 0.8 J/cm(2)) was
   applied for 2 weeks before the patient interrupted the therapy. In spite
   of this, there was further improvement and, in 1999, the patient was
   almost free of lesions with some abortive rings left. From time to time,
   single vesicles appeared within the elevated borders of the rings. The
   histology of such vesicles was consistent with abortive pustular
   psoriasis (Fig. 3).}},

   traditional blue-phase behavior. Furthermore a blue-phase-III-isotropic

Abstract = {{Injuries to the vessel wall and subsequent exposure of collagen from the
   subendothelial matrix result in thrombus formation. In physiological
   conditions, the platelet plug limits blood loss. However, in pathologic
   conditions, such as rupture of atherosclerotic plaques,
   platelet-collagen interactions are associated with cardiovascular and
   cerebral vascular diseases. Platelet glycoprotein VI (GPVI) plays a
   crucial role in collagen-induced activation and aggregation of
   platelets, and people who are deficient in GPVI suffer from bleeding
   disorders. Based on the fact that GPVI is coupled to the Fc receptor
   (FcR)-gamma chain and thus should share homology with the FcR chains,
   the genes encoding human and mouse GPVI were identified. They belong to
   the immunoglobulin tig) superfamily and share 64\% homology at the
   protein level. Functional evidence demonstrating the identity of the
   recombinant protein with GPVI was shown by binding to its natural ligand
   collagen; binding to convulxin (Cvx), a GPVI-specific ligand from snake
   venom; binding of anti-GPVI IgG isolated from a patient; and association
   to the FcR-gamma chain. The study also demonstrated that the soluble
   protein blocks Cvx and collagen-induced platelet aggregation and that
   GPVI expression is restricted to megakaryocytes and platelets. Finally,
   human GPVI was mapped to chromosome 19, long arm, region 1, band 3
   (19q13), in the same region as multiple members of the Ig superfamily,
   This work offers the opportunity to explore the involvement of GPVI in
   thrombotic disease, to develop alternative antithrombotic compounds, and
   to characterize the mechanism involved in GPVI genetic deficiencies. (C)

Abstract = {{An on-line analytical method has been developed to characterise brown
   coal samples and pieces from brown-coal based briquettes. The direct
   laser desorption from the sample into the gas flow of a gas
   chromatograph/mass spectrometer (GC/MS) allows an on-line analysis of
   polymer or macromolecular matrices, e.g. brown coal samples. This
   technique allows for analysis of coal without time-wasting clean-up
   steps as required in a classical `solvent-based' analysis. In this study
   two brown coal samples of different origin were investigated by on-line
   coupled laser desorption GC/MS (LD/GC/MS). The results were compared
   with classical analytical techniques like solvent-extraction or
   thermodesorption. Even though the laser pyrolysis led to distinctly
   different results in comparison to the classic methods, the
   chromatograms produced were reproducible and unique for each coal. The
   laser desorbed products can be divided into two types: pyrolysis
   compounds liberated from the coal matrix and unsaturated hydrocarbons
   generated by laser radiation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This article provides a comprehensive review of research on the effects
   of behavioral interventions on heterosexual adolescents' HIV sexual-risk
   behavior. It details adolescents' risk of sexually transmitted HIV
   infection and describes challenges associated with adolescent
   intervention research, including obtaining school and parent approval
   acid the validity of self-reported measures. It describes central
   characteristics of 36 controlled intervention studies assessing the HIV
   sexual-risk behavior of over 30 000 male and female adolescents 11-21
   years of age. It summarizes the participants' race/ethnicity and age,
   the theoretical framework, and the intervention setting, duration and
   outcome. This review reveals that the most commonly assessed behavioral
   outcomes were condom use and abstinence, and the largest effects sized
   were on condom use and condom acquisition. Effect sizes for abstinence
   and number of sexual partners were the smallest. Perceived self-efficacy
   and behavioral interventions were the most commonly assessed theoretical
   mediators. Key questions this research engaged in included whether
   behavioral skills can be increased, whether intervention-induced
   behavior change can be sustained, whether matching the race/ethnicity
   and gender of facilitators and participants enhances the effectiveness
   of culturally sensitive interventions, whether classroom teachers can
   effectively facilitate interventions, whether the behavior of high-risk
   populations can be changed, and which kinds of interventions are most
   effective. This review concludes that carefully designed theory-based
   interventions that take into account the characteristics of the
   particular population or culture can cause positive changes in
   adolescents' HIV sexual-risk behavior, bur boundary conditions for their
   effectiveness still need to be identified. Several suggestions for
   additional research are proffered. (C) 2000 Lippincott Williams \&

Abstract = {{An economic-engineering modeling approach is presented for integrating
   urban water supply reliability analysis with shortage management options
   such as dry year option and spot market water transfers, water reuse,
   and long- and short-term water conservation. The integrated model uses a
   probability plotting position formula to link supply-side yield
   simulation to probabilistic shortage management optimization. The
   approach can help joint planning of supply and demand management and
   estimate the economic value of expanding infrastructure and changing
   institutional constraints. Results from a case study show that jointly
   managing supply capacity and operating rule decisions with shortage
   management decisions within a risk analysis framework can create
   significant economic savings. The importance of hydrologic and
   institutional uncertainties is explored. Tuning supply system and
   reservoir operating policies to match the seasonal and cost
   characteristics of available shortage management measures is shown to be

Abstract = {{The free streamline problem investigated is that of fluid flow past a
   symmetric truncated concave-shaped profile between walls. An open wake
   or cavity is formed behind the profile. Conformal mapping techniques are
   used to solve this problem. The problem formulated in the hodograph
   plane is decomposed into two nonoverlapping domains. Heterogeneous
   modeling is then used to describe the problems, i.e., a different
   governing differential equation in each domain. In one of these domains,
   a Baiocchi-type transformation is used to obtain a fixed domain
   formulation for the part of the transformed problem containing an
   unknown boundary. In the other domain, the Baiocchi-type transformation
   is extended across the boundary between the two domains, thus yielding a
   different problem formulation. This also assures that the dependent
   variables and their normal derivatives are continuous along this common
   boundary. The numerical solution scheme, a successive over-relaxation
   approach, is applied over the whole problem domain with the use of a
   projection-operation over only the fixed domain formulated part.
   Numerical results are obtained for the case of a truncated circular
   profile. These results are found to be in good agreement with another
   published result. The existence and uniqueness of the solution to the

Abstract = {{The O-2 reduction reactions on Sr-doped LaMnO3 (LSM) electrodes in
   solid-oxide fuel cells in the absence and presence of a chromia-forming
   alloy metallic interconnect have been investigated. Similar to those in
   the absence of the chromia-forming alloy, the O-2 reduction reactions on
   LSM electrodes in the presence of chromia-forming alloys are limited by
   two electrode processes, the diffusion of oxygen species on the LSM
   surface and the migration of oxygen ions into zirconia electrolyte. In
   the presence of chromia;forming alloy, the dissociative adsorption and
   diffusion of oxygen on the LSM electrode surface are inhibited by the
   gaseous Cr species (e.g.:, CrO3), and the migration processes of oxygen
   ions into zirconia electrolyte are inhibited by the solid Cr species
   {[}e.g., Cr2O3/(Cr, Mn)(3)O-4] deposited on the electrolyte surface. The
   inhibiting effect of the solid Cr species becomes increasingly dominant
   on the O-2 reduction with the polarization time. The mechanism and
   kinetics of the O-2 reduction on the LSM electrodes in the absence and
   presence of chromia-forming alloy are discussed. (C) 2000 The

Abstract = {{We investigate phase-coherent electron transport through height-varying
   potential barriers in a quantum-dot superlattice. Due to the aspect
   ratio variations of two alternating potential heights in the quantum
   channel, well-arranged resonant peaks in the first miniband of each
   plateau are divided into the paired peaks of two groups, which produce
   an extra gap inside each miniband. In addition, for a five barrier case,
   the second and third resonant peaks in the miniband are no longer
   distinguishable at a critical aspect ratio, and the amplitude of this
   degenerate peak becomes smaller than one and eventually approaches zero.
   The mean lifetimes of the resonant peaks whose amplitudes remain unity
   are studied. We also examine the resonant tunneling with under-unity
   transmission in the one-dimensional superlattice system with alternating
   potential barriers. Finally, it is found that the ``quasi-resonance{''}
   appears in a quantum-dot superlattice with 13 barriers consisting of 2
   alternating potential heights. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Based on the dependence, legitimacy, and justice literatures, lye
   develop predictions about how two forms of power affect subordinates'
   anticipated emotional reactions to an inappropriate act by a superior
   and the likelihood that they will express these emotions toward their
   superior We test the effects of dependence and legitimacy on the
   anticipated experience of three backward-looking emotions (satisfaction,
   anger, and resentment) and two forward-looking emotions (excitement and
   worry). Using vignettes, we asked 330 college students to take the
   position of a subordinate in a conflict with a manager and describe how
   they feel and how likely they would be to express their emotions toward
   their manager. The design manipulated subordinates' and superiors'
   alternatives as well as endorsement and authorization of the superior.
   Results show that subordinates report the highest levels of anger and
   resentment when they are in the least dependent position and the lowest
   levels when they are in a highly and equally dependent relationship with
   their superior. They also report more resentment when their superior is
   not endorsed. Less dependent subordinates feel more excitement and less
   worry than highly dependent subordinates. They also feel more excitement
   when their superior is not endorsed Finally, subordinates in a highly
   dependent position or with a highly endorsed superior are less likely to
   report the likelihood of expressing negative emotions toward their

Abstract = {{Knowledge of soil chemistry is useful in assessing the sensitivity of
   forested areas to natural and anthropogenic disturbances, but
   characterizing large areas is expensive because of the large sample
   numbers required and the cost of soil chemical analyses. We collected
   and chemically analyzed soil samples from 72 sites within a 214-ha
   watershed in the Catskill Mountains of New York to evaluate factors that
   influence soil chemistry and whether terrain features could be used to
   predict soil chemical properties. Using geographic information system
   (GIS) techniques, we determined five terrain attributes at each sampling
   location: (i) slope, (ii) aspect, (iii) elevation, (iv) topographic
   index, and (v) flow accumulation. These attributes were ineffective in
   predicting the chemical properties of organic and mineral soil samples;
   together they explained only 1 to 25\% of the variance in pH(w),
   effective cation-exchange capacity (CECc), exchangeable bases,
   exchangeable acidity, total C, total N, and C/N ratio. Regressions among
   soil properties were much better; total C and pH, together explained 33
   to 66\% of the variation in exchangeable bases and CECc. Total C was
   positively correlated with N (r = 0.91 and 0.96 in Oa horizons and
   mineral soil, respectively), exchangeable bases (r = 0.65, 0.76), and
   CECc (r = 0.54, 0.44), indicating the importance of organic matter to
   the chemistry of these acidic soils. The fraction of CECc occupied by H
   explained 44\% of the variation in pH(w). Soil chemical properties at
   this site vary on spatial scales finer than typical GIS analyses,
   resulting in relationships with poor predictive power. Thus,
   interrelationships among soil properties are more reliable for
   prediction.}},

Abstract = {{The up-regulation of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) expression is a frequent
   occurrence in a variety of different tumors. In this study, COX-2
   protein expression was investigated in 50 glioma and 3 normal brain
   specimens by immunohistochemistry. Expression of COX-2 protein was
   observed in all normal brain and glioma specimens by
   immunohistochemistry, regardless of histological grade. The
   immunoreactive score was significantly higher in high-grade glioma than
   low-grade glioma and normal brain specimens. For a subset of these
   tumors (nine gliomas and three normal brain), Western blot analysis was
   also performed. COX-2 protein was detected in all specimens by Western
   blot analysis.
   The effect of the specific COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 on monolayer cell
   cultures and three-dimensional glioma spheroids was investigated using
   U-87MG and U-251MG human glioblastoma cell lines. The proliferation rate
   was assessed in monolayer cultures. In addition, a growth assay, a
   migration assay, an apoptosis assay, and a tumor invasion assay were
   performed in a three-dimensional spheroid culture system. NS-398 was
   able to reduce the proliferation of monolayer cell cultures, as well as
   the growth of spheroids and tumor fell migration, in a dose-dependent
   manner. There was also a moderate increase in the number of apoptotic
   cells in the treated spheroids. NS-398 did not have an inhibitory effect
   on tumor invasion in the coculture spheroid system. Our study provides
   evidence that COX-2 is up-regulated in the majority of high-grade
   gliomas and that a potential role of COX-2 inhibitors as an adjuvant
   therapy for brain tumors may exist.}},

Abstract = {{The proteinases of germinating barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) hydrolyze
   storage proteins into amino acids and small peptides that can be used by
   the growing plant or, during brewing, by yeast. They are critical for
   the malting and brewing processes because several aspects of brewing are
   affected by the amounts of protein, peptide, and amino acids that are in
   the wort. This study was carried out to quantitatively measure when
   endoproteinases form in green malt and whether they are inactivated at
   the high temperatures that occur during malt kilning. Little
   endoproteolytic activity was present in ungerminated barley, but the
   activities began forming 1 day into the ``germination{''} phase of
   malting, and they were nearly maximal by the third germination day.
   Quantitative studies with azogelatin ``in solution{''} assays showed
   that the green malt endoproteolytic activities were not inactivated
   under commercial kilning conditions that use temperatures as high as 85
   degrees C but that some actually increased during the final kilning
   step. Qualitative (2-D, IEF x PAGE) analyses, which allow the study of
   individual proteases, showed that some of the enzymes were affected by
   heating at 68 and 85 degrees C, during the final stages of kilning.
   These changes obviously did not, however, decrease the overall
   proteolytic activity.}},

Abstract = {{A postal survey of general practitioners (Grs) in the East Riding of

   the primary care setting, treatment regimen and the views about partner
   notification.
   Although all GPs had the facilities for chalmydial testing, their views
   on chlamydial screening differed widely and very few offered
   opportunistic screening. Most of the Grs would prefer the sexual health
   clinics (genitourinary medicine {[}GUM] clinics) to undertake partner
   notification. Less than half of the GPs surveyed offered the ideal
   antimicrobial therapy against chlamydial infection, as recommended by
   the Central Audit Group in Genito-urinary Medicine(1). This survey shows
   the necessity to disseminate proper guidelines for the management of
   uncomplicated C. trachomatis infection in the community. Sexual health
   clinics should make adequate provision to deal with additional workload
   resulting from the increased referrals of partners to the clinics when
   the opportunistic screening is widely provided by the GPs.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the role of apoptosis suppression in glioma chemotherapy
   resistance, protein levels and subcellular localization of bcl-2 family
   members were investigated in 2 pairs of sensitive cell lines and their

   1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU), induced apoptosis in both
   sensitive cell strains and apoptosis was suppressed in both resistant

   bcl-2 related protein consistent with the suppression of apoptosis.
   Independent of which bcl-2 family member was dysregulated, resistance
   was associated with altered regulation in the subcellular localization
   of bax protein. Following BCNU treatment, bax accumulated in nucleoli
   and a nuclei containing fraction of sensitive cells but not their
   resistant derivatives. Nuclear accumulation was an early event in
   apotosis induction. These data indicates altered subcellular
   localization of bax may play a role in resistance. In addition, the
   association between an early, nucleolar localization of bax and the
   induction of apoptosis suggests that localization of bax to nucleoli may
   play a role in apoptosis-induction of glioma cells.}},

Abstract = {{Single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis and DNA sequencing
   were used to characterize Mhc-DRB second exon variability in the Latxa
   and Karrantzar breeds of sheep. The presence of more than two sequences
   in some animals indicates that alleles of two different loci have been
   amplified. Six new alleles were identified by sequencing. The allele
   frequency distribution of the DRB1 gene is striking, with two alleles
   accounting for half of the gene pool in both breeds under study. The
   most frequent allele in both breeds was the same (named DRB1{*}0702),
   with some specific amino acids: Tyr in position 31 and Thr in 51. A
   species variability analysis was also performed including the entire set
   of sheep DRB exon 2 sequences. Based on the patchwork patterns of
   different alleles, interallelic recombination appears to be playing a
   significant role in the generation of allelic diversity at this locus in
   sheep. The phylogenetic tree of all known Caprinae DRB sequences shows
   that certain alleles from one species are more closely related to those
   from other species than they are to each other. Allele DRB1{''}'0702
   merits special attention due to its high similarity to the Mufflon
   allele. As this is the most frequent in both breeds analyzed, one can
   hypothesize that in sheep, both Mufflon and Argali have had different
   influences depending on the sheep breed under study and that the
   relationship between domestic sheep and Mufflon is greater than
   previously thought. The data generated in this study can serve as a
   basis for developing a typing assay for the sheep DRB genes in the Latxa
   and Karrantzar populations.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction. Orbitofrontal lesions may produce abnormal social conduct,

   Clinical cases. Two young people with orbitofrontal lesion due to THI

   comportmental changes similar to antisocial personality disease,
   including criminal actions. Neuropsychologically the first case showed
   memory, fluency and secuentiation impairment. The second patient'
   performance was normal.
   Conclusions. Prefrontal lesion may impair self-regulation, producing
   syndromes that prevent normal every-day life but are no much relevant in
   neurological and neuropsychological assessments. Orbitofrontal cortex
   plays an important role in social cognition which is the function that
   allows complex social behaviour. Because of the complexity of this
   function, syntoms can worse with the passage of time, thus a long
   follow-up of these patients is required.}},

Abstract = {{We hypothesized that tenascin expression is increased in pleural
   inflammatory and fibrotic diseases and that its expression can be used
   as a marker of active pleural involvement. For this purpose we analyzed
   71 histological samples of inflammatory and fibrotic pleura from
   patients with asbestos-induced pleural reaction (n = 6), postcardiac
   injury syndrome (n = 6), parapneumonic infection and/or empyema (n =
   23), tuberculosis (n = 5), rheumatoid disease (n = 1), and fibrosis with
   inflammation of unknown etiology (n = 30). All 71 cases were studied by
   immunohistochemistry for tenascin. In 19 selected cases tenascin mRNA in
   situ hybridization was also performed. In every case, tenascin was
   increased by immunohistochemistry. Most prominent immunoreactivity was
   detected in areas of newly formed fibrosis. Increased tenascin mRNA
   expression by in situ hybridization was detected in the individual cells
   of the newly formed fibrosis underneath the fibrinous exudate. The
   tenascin mRNA-positive cells localized in areas in which by
   immunohistochemical studies the cells were positive for alpha-smooth
   muscle actin, desmin, and vimentin, suggesting a myofibroblast
   phenotype. Tenascin mRNA expression was also seen less frequently in
   areas in which some cells were positive for cytokeratin. These cells
   might represent: mesothelial cells entrapped in the inflammatory lesion.
   Alternatively, they might represent fibroblast-type cells with aberrant
   cytokeratin expression. We conclude that in pleural inflammatory and
   fibrotic diseases tenascin immunoreactivity is increased and tenascin
   mRNA-positive cells localized mainly in the areas of myofibroblast- and,
   less often, mesothelial-type cells, suggesting that mainly
   myofibroblasts and, less commonly, also mesothelial cells might be
   responsible for tenascin expression in pleural inflammatory and fibrotic
   diseases.}},

Abstract = {{In this article we review and assess human-centered level of automation
   (LOA), an alternate approach to traditional, technology-centered design
   of automation in dynamic-control systems. The objective of
   human-controlled LOA is to improve human-machine performance by taking
   into account both operator and technological capabilities. Automation
   literature has shown that traditional automation can lead to problems in
   operator situation awareness (SA) due to the out-of-the (control) loop
   performance problem, which may lead to a negative impact on overall
   systems performance. Herein we address a standing paucity of research
   into LOA to deal with these problems. Various schemes of generic control
   system function allocations were developed to establish a LOA taxonomy.
   The functions allocated to a human operator, a computer, or both,
   included monitoring system variables, generating process plans,
   selecting an ``optimal{''} plan and implementing the plan. Five
   different function allocation schemes, or LOAs, were empirically
   investigated as to their usefulness for enhancing telerobot system
   performance and operator SA, as well as reducing workload. Human
   participants participated in experimental trials involving a high
   fidelity, interactive simulation of a telerobot performing nuclear
   materials handling at the various LOAs. Automation failures were
   attributed to various simulated system deficiencies necessitating
   operator detection and correction to return to functioning at an
   automated mode. Operator performance at each LOA, and during the failure
   periods, was evaluated. Operator SA was measured using the Situation
   Awareness Global Assessment Technique, and perceived workload was
   measured using the NASA-Task Load Index. Results demonstrated
   improvements in human-machine system performance at higher LOAs (levels
   involving greater computer control of system functions) along with lower
   operator subjective workload. However, under the same conditions,
   operator SA was reduced for certain types of system problems and
   reaction time to, and performance during, automation failures was
   substantially lower. Performance during automation failure was best when
   participants had been functioning at lower, intermediate LOAs (levels
   involving greater human control of system functions). (C) 2000 John

Abstract = {{N,N-dimethylaminopurine pentoxycarbonyl D-arginine (BCH-1393) is a novel
   low molecular weight synthetic immunomodulator that has been shown to
   significantly stimulate cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses both in vitro
   and in vivo (Zacharie B, Gagnon L, Attardo G, Connolly TP, St-Denis Y,
   Penney CL. Synthesis and activity of 6-substituted purine linker amine
   immunostimulants. J. Med. Chem. 1997;40:2883-94). Prompted by this
   evidence, we extended evaluation of BCH-1393 for anticancer activity in
   syngeneic mouse experimental tumor models. Consistent with previous
   findings, in vitro assessment of BCH-1393 activity demonstrated a
   significant increase in the CTL responses in the range of 10(-9)-10(-5)
   M. Treatment of mice with four consecutive daily intraperitoneal
   injections at 25 and 50 mg/kg resulted in a significant increase of the
   relative percentage of blood CD4+, CD8+, NK and monocyte subsets without
   any evidence of toxicity. In vivo anti-tumor activity of BCH-1393 was
   evaluated, either alone or in combination with subtherapeutic doses of
   cyclophosphamide (Cy), against weakly immunogenic mouse breast carcinoma
   DA-3 and strongly immunogenic colon adenocarcinoma MC38. Daily
   intraperitoneal injection of BCH-1393 at 50 mg/kg alone was well
   tolerated but produced a relatively weak anti-tumor effect in both tumor
   models. However, a significant inhibition of tumor outgrowth and
   suppression of established tumor growth was observed when BCH-1393 was
   administered in combination with subtherapeutic doses of Cy. Combination
   treatment of 50 mg/kg BCH-1393 with 100 mg/kg Cy (given as single
   intravenous bolus injection) starting 2 days prior to DA-3 tumor cell
   inoculation prevented tumor outgrowth in 70-80\% of treated mice. In the
   remaining 20-30\% of mice that had developed tumors, a nearly complete
   (90\%) tumor growth inhibition was observed at days 22-24 post tumor
   implant. In the MC38 tumor model, combination treatment of established
   tumors with BCH-1393 and Cy (CTX) at 50 mg/kg resulted in a significant
   delay in tumor growth compared to CTX treatment alone. The observed
   concomitant anti-tumor activity of BCH-1393 with cyclophssphamide
   warrants further investigation of this immunomodulator as an adjunctive
   treatment of cancer. (C) 2000 International Society for

   Study Design: Retrospective review.
   Setting: Level I trauma center.
   Patients: Patients (n = 105) with evidence of temporal bone trauma.
   Main Outcome Measures: Statistically significant associations between
   HRCT, clinical, audiometric, and head CT findings, and management
   decisions; role of HRCT in management decisions.
   Results: Statistical analysis demonstrated poor association between
   specific clinical and HRCT findings, and between HRCT findings and
   management decisions. The HRCT complemented decision making in 10\% of
   cases and revealed asymptomatic carotid canal fractures in 9\% Of cases.
   Conclusion: Routine HRCT yields minimal clinical utility. Selective use
   of HRCT may complement decision making, but patient management is
   predominantly influenced by other factors. Although angiography was
   performed in cases of asymptomatic carotid canal fractures, no clinical
   utility for this practice was demonstrated. An algorithm for temporal

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Background. Carbamylation is an irreversible process of non-enzymatic
   modification of proteins by the breakdown products of urea. For
   haemoglobin (Hb), the extent of carbamylation is a marker of urea
   exposure and has been proposed as an indicator of the control of uraemia
   by dialysis, analogous to the use of Hb glycosylation in diabetic
   patients.
   Methods. We performed a cross-sectional study of haemodialysis (HD) and
   peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients in order to study potential
   determinants of carbamylated Hb (CarbHb) and to investigate the
   relationship between CarbHb and established measures of dialysis
   dose/adequacy by multivariate analysis.
   Results. In 80 HD patients, CarbHb was independently predicted by
   post-dialysis urea (r = 0.40, P < 0.01), serum albumin (r = 0.24, P <
   0.05) and serum bicarbonate (r = -0.40, P < 0.05). No correlation was
   found between CarbHb and measures of dialysis dose/adequacy (Kt/V, urea
   reduction ratio, weekly dialysis duration, and normalized protein
   catabolic rate (nPCR)). In 42 PD patients, serum urea was the only
   significant independent predictor of CarbHb (r = -0.51, P = 0.001). No
   relationship was found between CarbHb and Kt/V, corrected creatinine
   clearance (CrCl) or nPCR in PD patients.
   Conclusions, Serum urea is the most consistent independent predictor of
   CarbHb in dialysis patients. This association in combination with the
   lack of a relationship with conventional measures of dialysis dose and a
   positive relationship with serum albumin suggest that a single
   measurement of CarbHb is unlikely to be a useful indicator of the
   adequacy of dialysis.}},

Abstract = {{The metabolism of vinorelbine, a new anticancer agent belonging to the
   vinca alkaloid family, was investigated in human liver microsomes.
   Vinorelbine biotransformation consisted of one saturable and one
   nonsaturable process, and the K-m and V-max values for the saturable
   process were 1.90 mu M and 25.3 pmol/min/mg of protein, respectively.
   Several studies, including metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes
   in a cDNA expression system and inhibition by specific antibodies and
   chemical inhibitors, showed that the main CYP enzyme involved in
   vinorelbine metabolism was CYP3A4. Also, the effects of vinorelbine on
   each of the CYP activities in human liver microsomes were investigated.
   High concentrations (100 mu M) of vinorelbine inhibited CYP3A4 activity
   (testosterone 6 beta-hydroxylation activity) by 45.2\%. However, the
   inhibitory effects of vinorelbine on the other CYP activities were
   minimal. The 50\% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of vinorelbine for
   testosterone 6 beta-hydroxylase was estimated to be 155 mu M. The plasma
   concentration in patients is expected to be much lower than this value.
   These results indicate that vinorelbine metabolism is expected to be
   modulated by the drugs that are able to inhibit or induce CYP3A
   activity.}},

Abstract = {{The formation of new blued vessel is essential for a variety of
   physiological precesses like embryogenesis and the female reproduction
   as well as wound healing and neovascularization of ischemic tissue.
   Major progress in understanding the underlying mechanisms regulating
   blood vessel growth has offered novel therapeutic options in the
   treatment of a variety of diseases including ischemic cardiovascular
   disorders.
   Vasculogenesis and angiogenesis are the mechanisms responsible for the
   development of the blood vessels. Angiogenesis refers to the formation
   of capillaries from preexisting vessels in the embryo and adult
   organism. While pathologic angiogenesis includes the role of post-natal
   neovascularization in the pathogenesis of arthritis, diabetic
   retinopathy, and tumor growth and metastasis, therapeutic angiogenesis,
   either endogenously or in response to administered growth factors,
   includes the development of collateral blood vessels in tissue ischemia.
   Preclinical studies established that angiogenic growth factors could
   promote collateral artery development in animal models of peripheral and
   myocardial ischemia. Subsequent clinical trials using gene transfer of
   naked DNA encoding for VEGF for the treatment of critical limb and
   myocardial ischemia documented the safety and clinical benefit of this
   novel therapeutic approach. Several objective methods indicated marked
   improvement in collateral vessel development.
   Vasculogenesis describes the development of new blood vessels from in
   situ differentiating endothelial cells. Recently considered to be
   restricted to embryogenesis, there exists now striking evidence that
   endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) circulate also in adult peripheral
   blood able to participate in ongoing neovascularization. Different
   cytokines and growth factors have a stimulatory effect on these
   bone-marrow derived EPC. Granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating
   factor (GM-CSF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mobilize
   EPC from the bone marrow into the peripheral circulation. While their
   endogenous contribution to postnatal neovascularization needs to be
   documented, the iatrogenic expansion and mobilization of EPC might
   represent an effective means to augment the resident population of
   endothelial cells (ECs). This kind of cell therapy for tissue
   regeneration in ischemic cardiovascular diseases opens a novel and
   challenging clinical option besides or in addition to the use of growth
   factors in gene therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Coal petrology and palynology of the Minto coal seam enable depositional
   environments of the precursor mire to be established in terms of
   facies-critical maceral ratios, maceral assemblages, and spore and
   pollen assemblages. The overall petrographic composition indicates a
   vitrinite-rich coal (mean 67\%), followed by inertinite (mean 27\%) and
   liptinite (mean 7\%). Pyrite is common to abundant (maximum 15\%).
   Lithotype logs demonstrate a dominance of dull lithotypes (dull and
   banded dull). Petrographic composition at the lithotype and seam
   subsection level is highly variable. Vitrinite maceral assemblages are
   enriched in brighter lithotypes (banded bright and bright), whereas
   liptinite and inertinite maceral assemblages are enriched in dull and
   banded dull lithotypes. The duller lithotypes are enriched by mineral
   matter. Based on spores, the seam is assigned to the Vestispora Zone of
   Atlantic Canada, with the basal Torispora securis-Torispora laevigata
   (SL) Zone of western Europe and the lower Torispora securis-Vestispora
   fenestrata (SF) of the Illinois Basin. This indicates an early Bolsovian
   (Westphalian C) age. Based on the Tissue Preservation Index -
   Gelification Index facies concept, the seam was deposited in an upper
   delta plain. At the seam subsection level, facies-critical maceral
   ratios (Groundwater Influence Index, Vegetation Index) and maceral
   assemblages suggest both limnic (open moor) conditions and somewhat
   drier conditions. Relative low Vegetation Indices suggest mainly
   herbaceous source material, which is partly supported by the rare to
   common occurrence of small lycopsid spores and arboreous lycopods. The
   abundant sphenopsids, including Calamites, and rare gymnosperms may have
   grown outside the mire.}},

Abstract = {{This article discusses the diffusion and solubility behavior of
   methanol/ methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) in glassy 6FDA-ODA polyimide
   prepared from hexafluoroisopropylidene 2,2-bis(phthalic anhydride)
   (6FDA) and oxydianiline (ODA). The diffusion coefficients and sorption
   isotherm of methanol vapor in 6FDA-ODA polyimide at various pressures
   and film thicknesses were obtained with a McBain-type vapor sorption
   apparatus. Methanol/MTBE mixed-liquid sorption isotherms were obtained
   by head-space chromatography and compared with a pure methanol sorption
   isotherm obtained with a quartz spring balance. Methanol sorption
   isotherms obtained with the two methods were almost identical. Both
   methanol sorption isotherms obeyed the dual-mode model at a lower
   activity, which is typical for glassy polymer behavior. The MTBE was
   readily sorbed into the polymer in the presence of methanol, but the
   MTBE sorption isotherm exhibited a highly nonideal behavior. The MTBE
   sorption levels were a strong function of the methanol sorption level.
   Methanol diffusion in the polymer was analyzed in terms of the partial
   immobilization model with model parameters obtained from average
   diffusion coefficients and the dual-mode sorption parameters. Simple
   average diffusion coefficients were obtained from sorption kinetics
   experiments, whereas the dual-mode sorption parameters were obtained
   from equilibrium methanol sorption experiments. An analysis of the
   mobility and solubility data for methanol indicated that methanol tends
   to form clusters at higher sorption levels. (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Kinesin superfamily proteins (KIFs) are the molecular motors conveying
   cargos along microtubules. KIF5s, the heavy chains of conventional
   kinesin (KHC), are originally identified members of KIFs, and neuronal
   KIF5A and ubiquitous KIF5B have been identified so far. In the present
   work, we cloned a novel member of KIF5, KIF5C, and generated specific
   antibodies against three KIF5s to investigate their distribution and
   functions. KIF5A showed pan-neuronal distribution in the nervous system.
   KIF5B showed a glial cell distribution pattern in general; however,
   interestingly, its expression was strongly upregulated in
   axon-elongating neurons, such as olfactory primary neurons and mossy
   fibers. KIF5C was also a neuronal KIF5 like KIF5A but was highly
   expressed in lower motor neurons in 2-week-old or older mice, suggesting
   its important roles in the maintenance of motor neurons rather than in
   their formation, such as axonal elongation. Because a large part of
   KIF5s in adult motor neurons were expected to be KIF5C, we generated
   mice lacking the kif5C gene to investigate the functions of KIF5C in
   neurons in living animals. The mutant mice showed smaller brain size but
   were viable and did not show gross changes in the nervous system. Closer
   examinations revealed the relative loss of motor neurons to sensory
   neurons. Because three KIF5s showed high similarity in the amino acid
   sequence, could rescue the KIF5B mutant cells, and could form
   heterodimers, we think that there are functional redundancy among the
   three KIF5s and that KIF5A and KIF5B prevented the KIF5C null mice from
   the severe phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{Mfge8 (milk Silt globule-ECF-factor 8) encodes a soluble
   integrin-binding protein containing two Notch-like EGF domains and two
   discoidin domains. It mediates cell-to-cell interaction by binding to
   integrin alpha nu beta 3 via the RGD motif of its second EGF domain.
   Mfge8 was first expressed at 10.0 dpc in cells of the coelomic
   epithelium covering the mesonephros, and at 10.5 dpe Mfge8-expressing
   cells were found in the mesenchyme underneath thc coelomic epithelium of
   the genital ridges. At 11.5-12.5 dpc, Mfge8 expressing cells were found
   in the stromal tissues subjacent to the coelomic epithelium that envelop
   the fetal gonad of both sexes. MFG-E8 protein was accumulated
   extracellularly in the interstitial tissues at the boundary of the
   mesonephros and the genital ridges. A comparison of the expression
   domains of Mfge8 and several gene markers showed that Mfge8 expression
   did not significantly overlap with the expression domain of Wt1 or Emx2,
   but partially with that of Lhx9 in 11.5-day XY gonads. Comparison of the
   expression pattern of Mfge8 with that of Hs3 beta 1 in the 12.5-day
   testes revealed that the Mfge8-positive cells constitute a previously
   uncharacterized somatic cell type which is distinct from Sertoli cells,
   Leydig cells, peritubular myoid cells and the endothelial cells. (C)

Abstract = {{Soil water distribution, irrigation water advance and uniformity, yield
   production and water-use efficiency (WUE) were tested with a new
   irrigation method for irrigated maize in an arid area with seasonal
   rainfall of 77.5-88.0 mm for 2 years (1997 and 1998). Irrigation was
   applied through furrows in three ways: alternate furrow irrigation
   (AFI), fixed furrow irrigation (FFI) and conventional furrow irrigation
   (CFI). AFI means that one of the two neighboring furrows was alternately
   irrigated during consecutive watering. FFI means that irrigation was
   fixed to one of the two neighboring furrows. CFI was the conventional
   method where every furrow was irrigated during each watering. Each
   irrigation method was further divided into three treatments using
   different irrigation amounts: i.e. 45, 30, and 22.5 mm water for each
   watering. Results showed that the soil water contents in the two
   neighboring furrows of AFI remained different until the next irrigation
   with a higher water content in the previously irrigated furrow.
   Infiltration in CFI was deeper than that in AFI and FFI. The time of
   water advance did not differ between AFI, FFI and CFI at all distances
   monitored, and water advanced at a similar rate in all the treatments.
   The Christiansen uniformity coefficient of water content in the soil
   (CUs) was used to evaluate the uniformity of irrigated water
   distribution and showed no decrease in AFI and FFI, although irrigation
   water use was smaller than in CFI. Root development was significantly
   enhanced by AFI treatment. Primary root numbers, total root dry weight
   and root density were all higher in AFI than in the FFI and CFI
   treatments. Less irrigation significantly reduced the total root dry
   weight and plant height in both the FFI and CFI treatments but this was
   less substantial with AFI treatments. The most surprising result was
   that AFI maintained high grain yield with up to a 50\% reduction in
   irrigation amount, while the FFI and CFI treatments all showed a
   substantial decrease of yield with reduced irrigation. As a result, WUE
   for irrigated water was substantially increased. We conclude that AFI is
   an effective water-saving irrigation method in arid areas where maize
   production relies heavily on repeated irrigation.}},

Abstract = {{Fornell (1992, Journal of Marketing, 56, pp. 6-21) has developed a
   method of measuring customer satisfaction by using structural equation
   modelling He introduces structural models that represent a conceptual
   network of processes that are aimed at satisfying the customer The model
   output is in the form of index measure of customer satisfaction and
   components of the customer satisfaction process. More recently, Kanji
   (1998, Total Quality Management, 7, pp. 633-643) has developed the
   Business Excellence model using customer satisfaction as a critical
   success factor for the organization. Here, the model measures 14
   interrelated latent variables that are based on the modified pyramid
   model of Kanji and Asher (Kanji, 1996). The model is based on
   well-established theories and approaches on business excellence criteria
   and draws on various currently used quality principles including
   customer satisfaction. In this paper, the authors have used a condensed
   version of Kunji's generic Business Excellence model to measure
   organization with the help of 10 interrelated latent variables. A
   typical example of the Business Excellence Index (BEI) for a group of
   companies is given using the present method. The authors believe that
   the BEI methodology given in this paper will help the organization to
   measure and compare different areas of its business both directly and
   over time. A high score of BEI achieved by this method will encourage
   the organization to apply for the Quality Award.}},

Abstract = {{The cell surface glycoprotein CD44 and its ligand, hyaluronan (HA),
   enhance growth and metastatic capacity of melanoma cells in vitro, but
   their clinical significance in primary cutaneous melanoma is still
   unclear, Therefore, we studied whether the levels of CD44 and HA
   associate with disease progression and survival of cutaneous melanoma, A
   series of 292 clinical stage I cutaneous melanomas was analyzed by
   immunohistochemistry using an anti-CD44H antibody (clone 2C5), HA was
   demonstrated histochemically using a biotinylated HA-specific affinity
   probe (bHABC). The reduced staining levels of CD44 and HA were
   associated with each other and indicators of progressive disease,
   Reduced CD44 and IIA level, high tumor thickness, high pT category, high
   Clark's level, bleeding, and male gender predicted short univariate
   recurrence free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). In Cox's
   multivariate analysis (N = 251), the decreased level of CD44, high tumor
   thickness, and bleeding predicted independently short RFS, High tumor
   thickness and bleeding were associated with short OS. We conclude that
   the reduced cell surface CD44 and HA levels associate with poor
   prognosis in clinical stage I cutaneous melanoma. The notion that the
   decreased level of CD44 independently predicts short RFS suggests that
   reduced cell surface CD44 enhances the spreading potential in localized
   cutaneous melanoma and that quantification of CD44 offers a prognostic
   tool for its clinical evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{Our approach in predicting gene expression levels relates to codon usage
   differences among gene classes. In prokaryotic genomes, genes that
   deviate strongly in codon usage from the average gene but are
   sufficiently similar in codon usage to ribosomal protein genes, to
   translation and transcription processing factors, and to
   chaperone-degradation proteins are predicted highly expressed (PHX). By
   these criteria, PHX genes in most prokaryotic genomes include those
   encoding ribosomal proteins, translation and transcription processing
   factors, and chaperone proteins and genes of principal energy
   metabolism. In particular, for the fast-growing species Escherichia
   call, Vibrio cholerae, Bacillus subtilis, and Haemophilus influenzae,
   major glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle genes are PHX. In
   Synechocystis, prime genes of photosynthesis are PHX, and in
   methanogens, PHX genes include those essential for methanogenesis.
   Overall, the three protein families-ribosomal proteins, protein
   synthesis factors, and chaperone complexes-are needed at many stages of
   the life cycle, and apparently bacteria have evolved codon usage to
   maintain appropriate growth, stability, and plasticity. New
   interpretations of the capacity of Deinococcus radiodurans for
   resistance to high doses of ionizing radiation is based on an excess of
   PHX chaperone-degradation genes and detoxification genes. Expression
   levels of selected classes of genes, including those for flagella,
   electron transport, detoxification, histidine kinases, and others, are
   analyzed. Flagellar PHX genes are conspicuous among spirochete genomes.
   PHX genes are positively correlated with strong Shine-Dalgarno signal
   sequences. Specific regulatory proteins, e.g., two-component sensor
   proteins, are rarely PHX. Genes involved in pathways for the synthesis
   of vitamins record low predicted expression levels. Several distinctive
   PHX genes of the available complete prokaryotic genomes are highlighted.
   Relationships of PHX genes with stoichiometry, multifunctionality, and
   operon structures are discussed. Our methodology may be used
   complementary to experimental expression analysis.}},

Abstract = {{A new method is proposed, based on the pole phase angle (PPA) of a
   second-order autoregressive (AR) model, to track spectral alteration
   during localised muscle fatigue when analysing surface myo-electric (ME)
   signals. Both stationary and non-stationary, simulated and real ME
   signals are used to investigate different methods to track spectral
   changes. The real ME signals are obtained from three muscles (the right
   vastus lateralis, rectus femoris and vastus medialis) of six healthy
   male volunteers, and the simulated signals are generated by passing
   Gaussian white-noise sequences through digital filters with spectral
   properties that mimic the real ME signals. The PPA method is compared,
   not only with spectra-based methods, such as Fourier and AR, but also
   with zero crossings (ZCs) and the first AR coefficient that have been
   proposed in the literature as computer efficient methods. By comparing
   the deviation (dev), in percent, between the linear regression of the
   theoretical and estimated mean frequencies of the power spectra for
   simulated stationary (s) and non-stationary (ns) signals, in general, it
   is found that the PPA method (dev(s) = 4.29; dev(ns) = 1.94) gives a
   superior performance to ZCs (dv(s) = 8.25) and the first AR coefficient
   (4.18<dev(s)<21.8; 0.98<dev(ns)<4.36) but performs slightly worse than
   spectra-based methods (0.33<dev(s)<0.79; 0.41<dev(ns)<1.07). However,
   the PPA method has the advantage that it estimates spectral alteration
   without calculating the spectra and therefore allows very efficient
   computation.}},

Abstract = {{The prevalence and severity of allergic asthma continue to rise, lending
   urgency to the search for environmental triggers and genetic substrates.
   Using microarray analysis of pulmonary gene expression and single
   nucleotide polymorphism-based genotyping, combined with quantitative
   trait locus analysis, we identified the gene encoding complement factor
   5 (CS) as a susceptibility locus for allergen-induced airway
   hyperresponsiveness in a murine model of asthma. A deletion in the
   coding sequence of CS leads to C5-deficiency and susceptibility.
   Interleukin 12 (IL-12) is able to prevent or reverse experimental
   allergic asthma. Blockade of the C5a receptor rendered human monocytes
   unable to produce IL-12, mimicking blunted IL-12 production by
   macrophages from C5-deficient mice and providing a mechanism for the
   regulation of susceptibility to asthma by C5. The role of complement in
   modulating susceptibility to asthma highlights the importance of
   immunoregulatory events at the interface of innate and adaptive immunity
   in disease pathogenesis.}},

   patients (7 women, 12 men) underwent bilateral MRI and US of the
   patellar tendons 27 (24-29) months after anterior cruciate ligament
   reconstruction using ipsilateral central third patellar tendon
   autografts. Two experienced radiologists blinded to one another
   evaluated the examinations. Measurements of the length of the noninjured
   patellar tendon showed the greatest reliability between MRI and US, with
   no systematic difference (P=0.48), a small mean difference (-0.1 mm),
   and an interclass correlation coefficient of 0.74. The measurements of
   the thick ness and width of the noninjured side were also judged as
   reliable. However, on the injured side a lower reliability was found
   between MRI and US. We conclude that MRI and US are reliable
   (interchangeable) methods only for evaluating noninjured patellar

Abstract = {{A minimax robust two-dimensional beamforming is developed for
   complex-valued observations contaminated by impulse random errors having
   a unknown heavy-tailed distribution. Estimates of directions of arrival
   (DOA) are defined by minimizing a nonquadratic residual function derived
   from the Huber's minimax robust estimation theory. A tracking ability of
   the estimates is assured by using the deterministic nonparametric model
   of source movement and a sliding window of observations, The proposed
   new beamformer has a two-dimensional power function. Maximum peaks of
   this power function are used for source separation and estimation of
   DOAs and their first derivatives. Simulation demonstrates that the new
   beamforming is able to solve tight sources, as well as to give high
   accuracy estimates for rapidly moving sources. Besides, the new
   estimates show the strong resistance to heavy-tailed distribution
   noises. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is an autosomal recessive disorder
   predominantly characterized by obesity, retinal dystrophy, polydactyly,
   learning difficulties, hypogenitalism and renal malformations, with
   secondary features that include diabetes mellitus, endocrinological
   dysfunction and behavioural abnormalities(1,2) Despite an initial
   expectation of genetic homogeneity due to relative clinical uniformity,
   five BBS loci have been reported, with evidence for additional loci in
   the human genome(3-7); however, no genes for BBS have yet been
   identified. We performed a genome screen with BBS families from
   Newfoundland that were excluded from BBS1-5 and identified linkage with
   D205189. Fine-mapping reduced the critical interval to 1.9 cM between
   D20S851 and D20S189, encompassing a chaperonin-like gene. Mutations in
   this gene were recently reported to be associated with McKusick-Kaufman
   syndrome (MKKS; ref. 8). Given both the mapping position and clinical
   similarities of these two syndromes, we screened MKKS and identified
   mutations in five Newfoundland and two European-American BBS pedigrees.
   Most are frameshift alleles that are likely to result in a
   non-functional protein. Our data suggest that a complete loss of
   function of the MKKS product, and thus an inability to fold a range of
   target proteins, is responsible for the clinical manifestations of BBS.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: To determine the relative frequency, incidence, and locations
   of metastases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), correlate extrahepatic
   metastatic disease with intrahepatic tumor staging, and determine the
   computed tomographic (CT) manifestations of HCC metastases.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: CT findings in 403 consecutive patients with HCC
   at our institution since 1992 were reviewed retrospectively. One hundred
   forty-eight patients with extrahepatic metastatic HCC were identified,
   and the locations, sizes, and attenuation and enhancement
   characteristics of the lesions were recorded.
   RESULTS: A majority (128 {[}86\%] of 148) of patients with extrahepatic
   HCC foci had either intrahepatic stage IVA tumor (112 {[}76\%] patients)
   or an intrahepatic stage III tumor (16 {[}11\%] patients) at the
   occurrence of metastases. The most frequent site of the first detectable
   metastasis was the lung (58 {[}39\%] patients). Tabulation of all
   extrahepatic metastatic sites showed the most common to be the lung in
   81 (55\%) patients, the abdominal lymph nodes in 60 (41\%) patients, and
   the bone in 41 (28\%) patients.
   CONCLUSION: The lung, abdominal lymph nodes, and bone are the most
   common sites of extrahepatic metastatic HCC. Most extrahepatic HCC
   occurs in patients with advanced intrahepatic tumor stage (stage IVA).
   Incidental extrahepatic lesions at CT in patients with stage I or It
   intrahepatic HCC are unlikely to represent metastatic HCC.}},

   and H-{[}Cys(Acm)(40,44,53), Lys(Boc)(42,51,67)]-Prc-MIH(40-75)-NH2,
   were prepared using peptides obtained via the Boc solid-phase method.
   Condensation of the building blocks in. the presence of silver chloride,
   3,4-dihydro-3-hydroxy-4-oxo-1,2,3-benzotriazine, and
   N,N-diisopropylethylamine, followed by removal of the protecting groups,
   gave the reduced form of Prc-MIH(1-75)-NH2. This product was converted
   to the native form of Pre-MIM (synthetic Pre-MIM) in a buffer which
   contained cysteine and cystine, The synthetic Pre-MIM showed the same
   behavior by RP-HPLC and biological activity assays as the natural
   Pre-MIM, The disulfide bond between Cys7 and Cys44 was determined by
   isolation of a fragment from an enzymatic digest of the synthetic
   Prc-MIH by RP-HPLC, followed by mass analysis. The disulfide bonds
   between Cys24 and Cys40 and between Cys27 and Cys53 were determined by
   comparing the elution position of an enzymatic digest of the synthetic
   Pre-MIM with authentic chemically synthesized samples, which contained
   three types of possible disulfide linkages.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of nicardipine
   prolonged-release implants for preventing vasospasm in a canine SAH
   model in a dose-escalating placebo-controlled blind fashion.
   Drug-release kinetics of copoly (lactic/glycolic acid) pellet containing
   nicardipine were evaluated in vitro. In vivo, 18 dogs were randomly
   assigned to one of three groups, i.e. placebo, low-dose (0.8 mg), or
   high-dose (8mg) nicardipine. Angiography was performed followed Dy right
   craniectomy, the induction of subarachnoid hemorrhage, and the placement
   of the pellets in the Sylvian fissure. On Day 7 and Day 14, the
   angiography was repeated. In the first four days, 61.9\% of the actual
   nicardipine loaded was released and within 10 days, 96\%. The average
   percent reductions of vessel diameters in the middle cerebral artery on
   Day 7 were 43\%, 14\% and 7\% in the placebo, low-dose, and high-dose
   groups, respectively (p = 0.0319). The mean concentration of nicardipine
   in the clots on Day 14 was 9.7x 10(-7) mol(-1) l(-1) and 5.1x10(-6)
   mol(-1) l(-1) in the low-dose and high-dose group, respectively. This

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of inflammatory mediators on the
   production of acfivin A, inhibin A, and the binding protein follistatin
   in term amnion and choriodecidual tissues.
   METHODS: The effects of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta; 1 ng/mL), tumor
   necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha; 10 ng/mL), and bacterial
   lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 5 mu g/mL) on production rates of activin A,
   inhibin A, and follistatin by term choriodecidual and amnion membranes
   in explant culture were determined using specific enzyme-linked
   immunoabsorbent assays.
   RESULTS: All explants (n = 6 placentas) produced detectable amounts of
   activity A, inhibin A, and follistatin under basal conditions;
   choriodecidual production rates were move than tenfold higher than
   amnion rates. In amnion explants, activin A production was stimulated by
   IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha to 450 +/- 155.4\% and 531 +/- 170.8\% of
   control, respectively (mean +/- standard error of the mean; P < .05 by
   analysis of variance), whereas production of inhibin and follistatin
   runs stimulated to a much more modest extent. Similar responses were
   observed in the choriodecidual explants. Lipopolysaccharide had no
   significant effect on amnion activin A production, but stimulated
   choriodecidual production to 290 +/- 34\% of control. Lipopolysaccharide
   exerted only limited effects on inhibin A and follistatin production.
   CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with proinflammatory mediators resulted in a
   preferential increase in acfivin A production compared with that of
   inhibin A or follistatin. These findings suggest that inflammation of
   the gestational membranes could result in increased local activin A
   production and bioactivity. Copyright (C) 2000 by the Society for

Abstract = {{A bank of 600 insertional mutants of Mycobacterium smegmatis was
   screened for mutants defective in stationary-phase survival. Of 74
   mutants picked by the initial screen, 21 had stationary-phase survival
   defects and 7 of these were studied in more detail. In general, mutants
   survived stationary phase significantly less well in rich medium than
   under carbon-starvation conditions. In all cases the loss of viability
   in stationary phase was not complete even after prolonged incubation.
   All mutants showed an initial decrease in viability, during the first 40
   d in stationary phase, followed by an increase in viable counts that
   returned viability close to the levels of the wild-type. Southern
   hybridization experiments showed that recovery of viability was not a
   consequence of precise excision or movement of the transposon. Two of
   the survival mutants differed from the wild-type in their colony
   morphology, and recovery of their viability in stationary phase was
   coincident with the return of wild-type colony morphology. It is
   possible that second-site suppressor mutations accumulate that alleviate
   the effects of the original mutation, For five of the mutants the DNA
   flanking the site of transposition was amplified by ligation-mediated
   PCR and sequenced to identify the disrupted locus. In each case,
   homologous genes were identified in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis
   genome, three of which have clearly predicted functions in M.
   tuberculosis as a penicillin-binding protein, in biotin biosynthesis and
   as a polyketide synthase. This is the first identification of genes
   implicated in the stationary-phase survival of mycobacteria.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews the underlying assumptions and principles of a new

   A core concept of POM/HR, thought recognition, is then compared with
   locus of control (LOC), a well-known psychological construct. Next, the
   relationship of LOC to self-reported happiness and satisfaction is
   examined from the perspective of POM/HR, using a sample of 1,872 at-risk
   adolescents from 17 nations. The findings support POM/HR predictions
   that (1) locus of central would account for a slight portion of the
   variance in adolescent happiness and satisfaction, (2) circumstances
   that are external in nature would account for additional variance in
   happiness and satisfaction, and (3) there would be little difference in
   self-reported happiness and satisfaction between adolescents
   self-reporting high and low internal LOG. Further, it was conjectured
   that the adolescents mistook superficial emotions, such as excitement
   and security, for genuine feelings of well-being. Finally, the
   implications for prevention and intervention efforts with at risk

Abstract = {{Purpose: L-selectin (CD62L) is a prerequisite for leucocyte adhesion to
   endothelial cells of blood vessels and consequently for transmigration.
   Its expression on the cell surface therefore regulates the ability of
   lymphocytes to enter lymph nodes, to re-enter blood vessels or to invade
   tissues at sites of inflammation. The aim of this stud was to determine
   the expression of CD62L on apoptotic lymphocytes after UVB irradiation.
   Materials and methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were
   isolated from peripheral blood of normal healthy volunteers. Cells were
   stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and ionomycin for
   activation. Apoptosis in peripheral T-cells and Jurkat cells was induced
   by irradiation wit UVB (120 mJ/cm(2)). In addition, T-cells or Jurkat
   cells were cultured for the indicated time with anti-Fas antibody CH11.
   The CH11-induced apoptosis ws inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor
   zVAD-fmk. For detection of apoptosis, cells were analysed by
   cytofluorometry for morphological changes typical for apoptosis. The
   reliability of the apoptotic cell gate was confirmed by staining with
   FITC-labelled annexin-V in the presence of propidium iodide (PI). For
   FACS analysis of CD62L expression on the cell-surface immunofluorescence
   was performed using FITC-conjugated anti-CD62L and PE-conjugated
   anti-CD3 antibodies. Soluble CD62L (sCD62L) in the cell supernatants was
   measured by standard ELISA technique. Assays were performed in the
   presence and absence of metalloprotease inhibitor KB8301.
   Results: PBMC from healthy volunteers undergoing apoptosis following UVB
   irradiation selectively shed CD62L, whereas the expression of the
   lineage-specific marker CD3 showed only minor changes. Shedding was
   blocked by the hydroxamic acid-based metalloprotease inhibitor KB8301.
   When Jurkat cells were treated wit the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk,
   anti-CD95 antibodies did not induce apoptosis, and the expression, of
   CD62L remained unaltered.
   Conclusion: UVB or ionizing radiation induce apoptosis in lymphocytes.
   The loss of CD62L is associated with apoptosis and will influence
   lymphocyte trafficking and, by excluding them from CD62L-mediated
   adhesion and tissue invasion, might contribute to the regulation of
   inflammation.}},

Title = {{Fault-tolerant evolvable hardware using field-programmable transistor

Abstract = {{The paper presents an evolutionary approach to the design of
   fault-tolerant VLSI (very large scale integrated) circuits using EHW
   (evolvable hardware). The EHW research area comprises a set of
   applications where GA (genetic algorithm) are used for the automatic
   synthesis and adaptation of electronic circuits. EHW is particularly
   suitable for applications requiring changes in task requirements and in
   the environment or faults, through its ability to reconfigure the
   hardware structure dynamically and autonomously, This capacity for
   adaptation is achieved via the use of GA search techniques. In our
   experiments, a fine-grained CMOS (complementary metal-oxide silicon)
   FPTA (field-programmable transistor array) architecture is used to
   synthesize electronic circuits, The FPTA is a reconfigurable
   architecture, programmable at the transistor level and specifically
   designed for EHW applications.
   The paper demonstrates the power of EA to design analog and digital
   fault-tolerant circuit. It compares two methods to achieve
   fault-tolerant design, one based on fitness definition and the other
   based on population.
   The fitness approach defines, explicitly, the faults that the component
   can encounter during its life, and evaluates the average behavior of the
   individuals. The population approach, on the other hand, uses the
   implicit information of the population statistics accumulated by the GA
   over many generations.
   The paper presents experiment results obtained using both approaches for
   the synthesis of a fault-tolerant digital circuit (XNOR) and a
   fault-tolerant analog circuit (multiplier), The experiments show that
   the EA (evolutionary algorithm) can synthesize fault-tolerant designs
   for both the analog and digital functions circuits that can recover for
   functionality when lost due to a-priori unknown faults by finding new
   circuit configurations that circumvent the faults.
   The paper shows that although the classic fault-tolerant design approach
   is able to create a reliable circuit design by evaluating the behavior
   of the circuit when well known faults are injected during the
   evolutionary process, better circuit performance, in less computation
   time, for a same fault-tolerant degree is achieved by allowing the
   evolutionary design process to be free of all faults constraints.}},

Abstract = {{This paper questions the methodology of Cutler, Davies, Rhodd and
   Schwarn (CDRS) (199'i) when testing restrictions on cointegrating
   vectors in a macroeconomic system. CDRS use the Johansen and Juselius
   (1992) H-5 test for testing single-vector and multiple-vector
   restrictions. I here argue that the single-vector H-5 test as applied by
   CDRS is redundant and only serves to inflate the appropriate p-value
   which arises from the Johansen and Juselius (1992) H-6 test. The p-value
   for the Hg test is theoretically predictable given the Hs test results.
   Regarding multiple vector restrictions, I argue that a test by Johansen
   (1996) is appropriate. From an economic perspective, my findings do
   reduce support for the existence of a U.S. long-run M1 equation in the
   macroeconomic system used by CDRS.}},

Abstract = {{We report here a new approach to introduce the effect of chemisorption
   in the Monte-Carlo simulation procedure for studying the segregation
   behaviour in bimetallic nanoparticles at low pressures. A
   coordination-dependent pair interaction energy is constructed in terms
   of partial bond energies and the exchange energy where the partial bond
   energy can be empirically calculated from the experimental values of
   dimer energy, the pressure-dependent surface energy and the bulk
   cohesive energy of the constituent metals. The advantage of this
   procedure is the ability to estimate the pressure-dependent surface
   composition of the nanoparticles. The method has been applied to
   oxygen-adsorbed Pd-Ag systems; and it is found that while Ag segregate
   in clean particles, at higher oxygen pressures Pd atoms segregate to the
   surface. The present technique has been argued to be suitable for higher
   pressures ( > 10(-5) Torr) when coverage cannot be accurately
   determined. At low-pressure regime(< 10(-5) Torr) the results compare
   qualitatively well with the previous MC results where the effects of
   adsorbates were considered through a coverage-dependent additional term

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to compare the performance of genetic
   algorithms (GAs) and the best available heuristic, known as the RAND,
   for solving the joint replenishment problem (JRP). An important feature
   of the JRP which makes it suitable for GAs is that it can be formulated
   as a problem having one continuous decision variable and a number of
   integer decision variables equal to the number of products being
   produced or ordered.
   Experiments on randomly generated problems indicate that GAs can provide
   better solutions to the JRP than the RAND for some problems, and at
   worst can almost match the performance of the RAND from a practical
   point of view for the rest of the problems. GAs never converged to
   solution with a total cost of more than 0.08\% of the total cost of the
   RAND for 1600 randomly generated problems. In addition, GAs have the
   advantages of : (i) being easy to implement (e.g. less than 200 lines of
   code); (ii) having a code which is easy to understand and modify; and (
   iii) dealing easily with constrained JRPs which are neglected by most of
   the available methods including the RAND, in spite of their importance

Abstract = {{Purpose: A new collimator cone system has been developed at the Samsung
   Medical Center that overcomes some of the limitations of present
   commercially supplied collimator cones. The physical properties of the
   newly developed cone system are described in this report.
   Methods and Materials: The new cones have relatively larger aperture
   sizes (3.0-7.0 cm in diameter) and are 16 cm in length. Each new cone is
   fabricated with cerrobend alloy melted and poured into a stainless steel
   housing that is permanently fixed to a mounting plate. The mounting
   plate of the new cone is designed to insert into the wedge mount slot of
   the pantry head. The mechanical accuracy of the central axis of the cone
   pointing to the isocenter was tested using film. a steel ball positioned
   at the isocenter by the mechanical isocenter device. For the evaluation
   of beam flatness and penumbra, off-axis ratios at 5 cm depth were
   measured by film dosimetry using polystyrene phantom.
   Results: The average error of the mechanical isocenter was 0.27 mm (+/-
   0.16 mm), The beam flatness was excellent in the central region of the
   beam, and the average penumbra width was 3.35 mm (+/- 0.25 mm), The new
   cone design has more clearance between the patient's head and the
   gantry, and can more easily be removed from the gantry head because it
   slides in and out of the wedge slot. This facilitates changing cone
   sizes during one treatment session, and makes the process of double
   exposure port films easier.
   Conclusions: A new collimator cone system for stereotactic radiation
   therapy has been developed. The mechanical accuracy and physical
   properties are satisfactory for clinical use, and the new design permits
   a wider range of clinical applications for stereotactic radiation
   therapy. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.}},

Abstract = {{We study the morphologies of river networks on various landscapes. In
   general, the probability density distribution of drainage area a of the

   where G(r=R) becomes zero. In our restricted solid on solid network
   model, R is independent of the system size L and tau is close to 4/3,
   which is the value of the Scheidegger's river network model with random
   walk process. We also consider an avalanche model, where R is
   proportional to L. There is a large slope-slope correlation length and
   the river network does not follow the directed random walk process with

Abstract = {{PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to examine smoking behavior,
   knowledge, and beliefs among Korean Americans.
   DESCRIPTION OF STUDY: One hundred four Korean American men and 159
   women, 40 to 69 years old, living in Chicago, Illinois, served as study
   respondents. The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) Cancer Control
   Supplement Questionnaire was used to collect data. The NHIS was
   translated into Korean with minor modifications to develop a culturally
   appropriate instrument.
   RESULTS: This study suggests that smoking is almost exclusively a male
   behavior (38.5\%) and that Korean American men smoke : mostly
   cigarettes. Almost 90\% of women have never smoked, :: : : whereas 23\%
   of men reported never smoking. Respondents with a non-Christian
   background or no religious affiliation,were 16.5 times more likely to be
   current smokers. Respondents who had lived in the United States less
   than 10 gears were 12.5 times more likely to be current smokers. More
   than 90\%:of men, regardless of smoking status, were able to identify an
   association between; smoking and major chronic diseases.
   CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The prevalence of smoking among these Korean
   American men places them at considerable risk for smoking-related
   disease. Healthcare providers must be better informed about smoking
   behavior in this group, and specific attention to recently migrated men
   and those reporting religions other than Christianity is recommended.
   Health-protecting strategies for women and children who fall victim to
   secondhand smoke, or who may be targeted by tobacco advertising, are
   also an important step in disease prevention for this population.}},

Abstract = {{EDI (electronic data interchange) messages are notoriously lean and
   difficult (or impossible) to interpret without additional information.
   The authors acknowledge the many criticisms of the EDI protocols, but
   argue that there is something basically correct, even inevitable, in the
   leanness of EDI messages. They present a framework that describes how
   EDI messages are interpreted, and indeed must be interpreted.
   ``Unwrapping{''} and ``unfolding{''} of messages ore the central
   elements. These concepts ore discussed in detail, and the article
   demonstrates how to exploit them in formalizations for electronic
   commerce. In particular, it shows how Kimbrough's lean-event semantics
   for speech acts, and Ton and Thoen's theory of directed obligation can
   be fit naturally and fruitfully into this framework, and to each other.
   Much remains to be done, but the progress in formalization in evidence
   here should be generalizable.}},

Abstract = {{Cogongrass is a nonindigenous species perceived to threaten native
   communities of the southeastern United States through modification of
   species composition and alteration of community processes. To examine
   how gap size and disturbance type influence the invasion of wet pine
   savannas by cogongrass, we performed three field experiments to evaluate
   the response of cogongrass seeds and transplanted seedlings to four
   different gap sizes, four types of site disturbance, and recent burning
   of savanna vegetation. Cogongrass germinated, survived, and grew in all
   gap sizes, from 0 to 100 cm in diameter. Similarly, disturbance type had
   no effect on germination or seedling and transplant survival. Tilling,
   however, significantly enhanced transplanted seedling growth, resulting
   in a tenfold increase in biomass over the other disturbance types.
   Seedling survival to 1 and 2 mo was greater in burned savanna than
   unburned savanna, although transplant survival and growth were not
   affected by burning. Results of this study suggest that cogongrass can
   germinate, survive, and grow in wet pine savanna communities regardless
   of gap size or type of disturbance, including burning. Burning of
   savanna vegetation may enhance establishment by improving early seedling
   survival, and soil disturbance can facilitate invasion of cogongrass by
   enhancing plant growth.}},

Abstract = {{During water treatment, chlorine reacts with naturally occurring organic
   matter in surface water to produce a number of by-products. Of the
   by-products formed, trihalomethanes (THMs) are among the highest in
   concentration. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to evaluate the
   relationship between the level of total THM and specific THMs in public
   water supplies and risk for stillbirth. The cohort was assembled from a
   population-based perinatal database in the Canadian province of Nova
   Scotia and consisted of almost 50,000 singleton deliveries between 1988
   and 1995 Individual exposures were assigned by linking mother's
   residence at the time of delivery to the levels of specific THMs
   monitored in public water supplies. Analysis was conducted for all
   stillbirths and for cause-of-death categories based on the physiologic
   process responsible for the fetal death. Total THMs and the specific
   THMs were each associated with increased stillbirth risk. The strongest
   association was observed for bromodichloromethane exposure, where risk
   doubled for those exposed to a level of greater than or equal to 20 mu
   g/L compared to those exposed to a level < 5 mu g/L (relative risk =
   1.98, 95\% confidence interval, 1.23-3.49). Relative risk estimates
   associated with THM exposures were larger for asphyxia-related deaths
   than for unexplained deaths or for stillbirths overall. These findings
   suggest a need to consider specific chlorination by-products in relation
   to stillbirth risk, in particular bromodichloromethane and other
   by-product correlates. The finding of a stronger effect for asphyxia
   deaths requires confirmation and research into possible mechanisms.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A brief, transient episode of cerebral ischemia causes selective loss of
   CA1 pyramidal cells in the hippocampus. Interestingly, it takes 2-3 days
   for the neuronal damage of CA1 to become morphologically obvious; hence,
   the term `delayed neuronal death' was coined to describe this
   phenomenon. Approximately two decades after it was first recognized, the
   precise mechanism of delayed neuronal death is not yet fully understood.
   The most widely supported explanation is the glutamate-Ca2+ theory, in
   which vulnerability of CA1 neurons is ascribed to their property of
   neurotransmitters and their receptors. Although this theory explains the
   early phase of neuronal response to ischemia fairly well, it does not
   offer a satisfactory explanation for the delayed phase of the process.
   Excessive accumulation of Ca2+ is observed in CA1 following transient
   ischemia, but accumulating evidence suggests that additional changes at
   the molecular level have to follow to completing the dying process,
   including expression of various apoptosis-related genes. Further studies
   are, therefore, necessary to elucidate the mechanism of delayed neuronal
   death which, in turn, may open a new window for the treatment of stroke.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of re-oxidation treatment on the solubility in dopants and
   the dielectric properties of Ho-Mg- and Ho-Mn-substituted BaTiO3 was
   investigated. The lattice parameter and electrical resistivity results
   indicated that the pre dominant occupational sites of Ho ions changed
   from A-sites to B-sites by increasing the doped content in both systems.
   In the case of Ho-Mn-substituted samples, the decrease in lattice
   parameter and a shift of the Curie point (T-c) to higher temperatures by
   re-oxidation treatment were observed in the range in which Ho ions
   predominantly occupy B-sites (act as accepters). On the other hand,
   Ho-Mg-substituted samples showed little change. Electron spin resonance
   measurements revealed that these changes due to re-oxidation were based
   on the decrease of the ionic size of Mn due to the oxidation of Mn2+ to
   Mn3+ or Mn4+ The occupational sites of Ho ions strongly affected the
   valence state of Mn and the dielectric properties of BaTiO3.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the nature and course of ophthalmologic
   abnormalities and their clinical significance in Cohen syndrome.
   Study Design: Observational case series.
   Participants: Twenty-two Cohen syndrome patients aged 2 to 57 years were
   examined, and a retrospective review of ophthalmologic records was
   carried out for 14 of them. All but one were part of the Finnish study
   of refined mapping of the Cohen syndrome gene by linkage disequilibrium
   in chromosome 8.
   Main Outcome Measures: Visual acuity (VA), cycloplegic refraction,
   biomicroscopy, lens opacitometry, ophthalmoscopy, and fundus
   photography.
   Results: With the exception of the two youngest patients, all had
   symptoms such as nyctalopia, impaired vision, and visual field loss.
   Progressive, often high-grade myopia, astigmatism, and retinochoroidal
   dystrophy resembling retinitis pigmentosa occurred in all, except for
   the youngest patients. The earliest fundus changes were pale disc and
   pale fundus with or without pigment granularity, followed by narrowed
   vessels, pigment clumps, and bone spiculelike pigment accumulations by
   10 to 20 years of age. Pigment deposits increased and approached the
   posterior pole by 35 to 40 years of age. Patients more than 45 years of
   age had severe retinochoroidal atrophy. A bull's-eye macula was seen in
   most patients. Teenagers had peripheral lens opacities, and young adults
   had early nuclear sclerosis confirmed by lens opacitometry. Older
   patients also had posterior subcapsular cataracts, iris atrophy, and
   iridophacodonesis. Vision started to deteriorate at the age of 6 to 10
   years, but remained relatively good (VA 0.5-0.1) in most patients until
   30 and, in one case, 46 years of age. Older patients were severely
   visually handicapped (VA hand motion to light perception), but none were
   completely blind.
   Conclusions: Progressive myopia and retinochoroidal dystrophy ave
   essential features in Cohen syndrome and, together with early lens
   opacities, lead to deterioration of vision. Cohen syndrome patients need
   careful ophthalmologic follow-up at all ages. Nyctalopia and restricted
   visual fields should be considered when planning the patient's daily
   activities. Ophthalmology 2000; 107:1737-1745 (C) 2000 by the American

Abstract = {{The aim of the experiment was to determine macroelement concentration
   (Na, K, Cl, Ca, Mg and P-inorg) in the blood serum and bone tissue of
   14-day-old lambs of the Polish Merino breed, coming from various areas
   of West Pomerania. The lambs were from. 3 sheepfolds: 25 lambs were from
   ZZD Kolbacz (group I), 49 from RZD Lipki (group II) and 50 from SK
   Nowilice (group III). The animals were of both sexes (in comparable
   numbers), of confirmed origin and of similar physical traits. The lambs
   had been fed according to Animal Feeding Standards. Magnesium
   concentration in the serum was the highest in lambs of group III, from
   the seaside, and was at the upper limit of the standards (1.25 mmol/l).
   Calcium concentration showed the opposite trend, as its content was at
   the lower limit of the standards (2.33 mmol/l). The results of the
   concentration of Na, K, Cl, Ca, Mg and P-inorg were within the standard
   limits; however, statistically significant differences were observed (P
   less than or equal to 0.05).
   The concentration of minerals (Na, K, Ca, Mg and P-inorg) in lamb bone
   tissue also revealed significant differentiation (P less than or equal
   to 0.01). Unlike in the serum, the highest levels of mineral elements in
   bone tissue were observed in the lambs coming from the centre of West
   Pomerania region (RZD Lipki). Comparing the concentration of the
   minerals in the blood serum and bone tissue, it was observed that their
   high level in bone tissue is related to their low level in the blood
   serum of the lambs. This effect appeared in all the sheepfolds,
   irrespective of their geographical location. It seems necessary to
   return to soil limincy or to adding calcium salts to eliminate calcium
   deficiency and to improve the relations between other elements.}},

Abstract = {{The crystallographic and magnetic properties of the Mn{[}N(CN)(2)](2)
   compound have been investigated by de magnetization. ac susceptibility,
   specific heat, and zero-field neutron diffraction on polycrystalline
   samples. The magnetic structure consists of two sublattices which are
   antiferromagnetically coupled and spontaneously canted. The spin
   orientation is mainly along the a axis with a small uncompensated moment
   along the b axis. The ground state is a crystal-field sextet with large
   magnetic anisotropy. The crystal structure consists of discrete
   octahedra which are axially elongated and successively tilted in the ab
   plane. Comparisons of the magnetic structures for the isostructural
   M{[}N(CN)(2)](2) (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) series suggest that the spin
   direction is stabilized by crystal fields and the spin canting is
   induced by the successive tilting of the octahedra. Wr propose that the
   superexchange interaction is the mechanism responsible for the magnetic
   ordering in these compounds and we find that a crossover from
   noncollinear antiferromagnetism to collinear ferromagnetism occurs for a
   superexchange angle of alpha(c) = 142.0(5)degrees.}},

Abstract = {{Rectal tubulopapillary polyps were diagnosed in eight dogs following
   proctoscopy and mucosal pinch biopsy. Histological examination of the
   pinch biopsies revealed evidence of malignant transformation in three of
   the cases. The remaining cases were diagnosed as benign polyps.
   Inflammatory changes were observed in four cases. Seven dogs were
   treated with piroxicam suppositories and one with oral piroxicam. All
   dogs were re-examined after four to six weeks of piroxicam therapy and
   the extent of haematochezia, tenesmus and faecal mucus production was
   reduced in all cases. The owners of seven of the dogs considered the
   improvement in clinical signs to be good or excellent. Cases with and
   without evidence of inflammation responded equally well. This finding
   supports the hypothesis that piroxicam has an antineoplastic effect due
   to apoptosis and alteration in the cell cycle. Medical management with
   piroxicam may provide a non-invasive treatment option for dogs with
   rectal polyp formation in which surgical treatment is likely to be
   associated with complications such as incontinence, infection and wound
   breakdown, or where the owner declines such treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Noam Chomsky claims that we know the grammatical principles of our
   languages in pretty much the same sense that we know ordinary things
   about the world (e.g. facts), a view about linguistic knowledge that I
   term ``cognitivism{''}. In much recent philosophy of linguistics
   (including that sympathetic to Chomsky's general approach to language),
   cognitivism has been rejected in favour of an account of grammatical
   competence as some or other form of mental mechanism, describable at
   various levels of abstraction ({''}non-cognitivism{''}). I argue for
   cognitivism and against non-cognitivism. First, I show that the
   distinction between competence and performance in current linguistics is
   as clearly made as ever it was, in spite of recent interest in
   linguistic processing modules. Second, I use these facts about the
   practice of theoretical linguistics to refute various proposals for a
   non-cognitivist construal of grammatical competence, and to support
   cognitivism by reflecting on the inapplicability of a multi-level
   account of linguistic competence. Cognitivism is then defended against
   several objections centring around the problems of rational integration
   and conceptualization of grammatical knowledge. Finallly, the conception
   of competence argued for in relation to linguistics is placed in the
   larger context of cognitive science research and its implications for
   philosophy of mind.}},

Abstract = {{The response of gastric motility to the administration of water and
   saline in the larynx and epiglottis was investigated in
   urethanchloralose anesthetized rats. Administration of water inhibited
   motility of the distal stomach, but 0.15 M NaCl did not induce the
   inhibitory response. Bilateral sectioning of the superior laryngeal
   nerve (SLN) abolished the inhibitory response induced by water.
   Bilateral cervical vagotomies abolished the inhibitory responses,
   although spinal transection did not affect the inhibitory response.
   These inhibitory responses have been observed in immobilized animals.
   The degree of inhibition by water and hypotonic saline was negatively
   correlated with the sodium concentration. In contrast, the degree of
   inhibition to hypertonic saline was positively correlated with the
   sodium concentration. The proximal stomach also showed a reduction in
   intragastric pressure in response to the administration of water. These
   findings suggest that water-responsive afferent neurons in the SLN
   suppress gastric motility via the vagal efferent nerve.}},

Abstract = {{Protagonists in the so-called Science Wars differ most markedly in their
   views about the role of values in science and what makes science
   valuable. Scientists and philosophers of science have traditionally
   considered the principal aims of science to be explanation and
   application. Only cognitive values should influence what is taken to be
   explanatory. Social and political values affect the priority assigned to
   various scientific problems and the ways in which scientific results are
   applied. Ethical considerations may be brought to bear on the treatment
   of human and animal subjects, and the manner in which scientific results
   are communicated.
   Recent critiques of science allege that the content of scientific
   explanations reflects the dominant ideology and interests of scientists
   and their patrons. Instead of calling for more value neutrality, some
   now urge that science take as a principal aim the emancipation of
   oppressed subcultures. Not only should progressive political values be
   allowed to set the problems attempted, they also should be used to
   constrain the types of answers which are pursued. Since scientific
   knowledge is constructed by us, we should take responsibility for its
   content.
   This paper argues that the project of Emancipationist science is
   impractical and self-defeating. There is good reason to believe that
   there would be unresolvable political disputes concerning which kinds of
   scientific theories are truly emancipiatory. Furthermore, just as
   placebos cease to work when recognized as such, so would a science known
   to be constrained by political considerations lose its special epistemic
   authority.}},

Abstract = {{Near-atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy was used to
   investigate the chloritization mechanisms of biotite in a granitic rock
   and to reveal polytypic details of the resulting chlorite. Comparison of
   stacking sequences in 2M(1) and longer period biotite polytypes with
   sequences in areas containing chlorite layers revealed that typically,
   two biotite layers transform to one chlorite layer, losing two potassium
   interlayer sheets and two tetrahedral sheets. In some cases, more than
   two biotite layers are replaced by one chlorite layer. Less commonly, a
   potassium interlayer sheet is replaced by a brucite-like sheet. One
   biotite layer is transformed to one serpentine layer via loss of a
   potassium interlayer and a tetrahedral sheet in places. Based on the
   relative frequency of the two chlorite layers to one biotite layer vs,
   one biotite layer to one chlorite layer mechanisms, the net result of
   chloritization is a considerable volume decrease along c{*}:.
   Near-atomic-resolution images recorded down {[}010], {[}310], or {[}3
   (1) over bar 0] revealed that the chlorite polytype in the
   biotite-chlorite interstratifications is predominantly IIbb. However
   mixtures of Ibb, Iab, IIab, and IIbb also occur. The ``aa{''} stacking
   sequences were never found. Chlorite polytypes may be determined in part
   by the chloritization mechanisms and in part by relief of local shear by
   a/3 displacements.}},

Abstract = {{A recently identified membrane-type 6 matrix metalloproteinase (MT6-MMP)
   has a hydrophobic stretch of 24 amino acids at the C-terminus, This
   hydrophobicity pattern is similar to glycosyl-phosphatidyl inositol
   (GPI)-anchored MMP, MT4-MMP, and other GPI-anchored proteins. Thus, we
   tested the possibility that MT6-MMP was also a GPI-anchored proteinase,
   Our results showed that MT6-MMP as well as MT4-MMP were labeled with
   {[}H-3]ethanolamine indicating the presence of a GPI unit with
   incorporated label. In addition, phosphatidyl inositol-specific
   phospholipase C treatment released MT6-MMP from the surface of
   transfected cells, These results strongly indicate that MT6-MMP is a
   GPI-anchored protein. Since two members of MT-MMPs are now assigned as
   GPI-anchored proteinase, MT-MMPs can be subgrouped into GPI type and
   transmembrane type. (C) 2000 Federation of European Biochemical

Abstract = {{Porous silicon thin films created under laser illumination in fluoride
   solutions without biasing have been studied by a variety of techniques
   to investigate the film structure and photoluminescence (PL). The use of
   ultrathin silicon wafers allows us to perform plan view transmission
   electron microscopy studies without recourse to thinning procedures that
   might adversely affect the film structure. Supercritically dried samples
   are compared to air dried samples and clearly demonstrate the
   deleterious effects of air drying on film structure. PL studies were
   performed (a) while the sample is submerged in aqueous HF, (b) in Ar
   after rinsing in ethanol, and (c) in air after rinsing in ethanol. The
   wavelength of light used to fabricate the film is found to correlate
   strongly with the peak PL wavelength when measured in solution. Little
   correlation is found in Ar or in air. Exposure to air can change the PL
   spectrum dramatically on a time scale of just seconds. We demonstrate
   that samples can exhibit essentially identical PL spectra in one medium
   but have spectra that differ from one another when the samples are
   placed in a different medium. The PL results indicate that band-to-band
   recombination cannot explain photon emission under all circumstances,
   and that surface states must also be involved in radiative processes
   under those conditions in which the bands are sufficiently separated to
   allow for the appearance of gap states. (C) 2000 American Institute of

Abstract = {{We present new results of a relativistic quark model based on the
   Bethe-Salpeter equation in its instantaneous approximation. Assuming a
   linearly rising confinement potential with an appropriate spinorial
   structure in Dirac space and adopting a residual interaction based on
   instanton effects, we can compute masses of the light mesons up to
   highest observed angular momenta with a natural solution of the U-A(1)
   problem. The calculated ground states masses and the radial excitations
   describe the experimental results well. In this paper, we will also
   discuss our results concerning numerous meson decay properties. For
   processes like pi (+)/K+ --> e(+)nu (e)gamma and 0(-) --> gamma gamma at
   various photon virtualities, we find a good agreement with experimental
   data. We will also comment on the form factors of the K-l3 decay and on
   the decay constants of the pi, K and eta mesons. For the sake of
   completeness, we will furthermore present the electromagnetic form
   factors of the charged pi and K mesons as well as a comparison of the
   radiative meson decay widths with the most recent experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{A major determinant of the risk for osteoporosis is peak bone mineral
   density (BMD), which is largely determined by genetic factors. mie
   recently reported linkage of peak BMD in a large sample of healthy
   sister pairs to chromosome 11q12-13. To identify additional loci
   underlying normal variations in peak BMD, we conducted an autosomal
   genome screen in 429 Caucasian sister pairs. Multipoint LOD scores were
   computed for BMD at four skeletal sites. Chromosomal regions with LOD
   scores above 1.85 were further pursued in an expanded sample of 595
   sister pairs (464 Caucasians and 131 African-Americans).
   The highest LOD score attained in the expanded sample was 3.86 at
   chromosome 1q21-23 with lumbar spine BMD. Chromosome 5q33-35 gave a LOD
   score of 2.23 with femoral neck BMD. At chromosome 6p11-12, the 464
   Caucasian pairs achieved a LOD score of 2.13 with lumbar spine BMD.
   Markers within the 11q12-13 region continued to support linkage to
   femoral neck BMD, although the peak LOD score was decreased to 2.16 in
   the sample of 595 sibling pairs. Our study is the largest genome screen
   to date for genes underlying variations in peak BMD and represents an
   important step toward identifying genes contributing to osteoporosis in
   the general population.}},

Abstract = {{A structurally unusual member of the adipokinetic hormone/red
   pigment-concentrating hormone peptide family was isolated from corpora
   cardiaca of the painted lady butterfly, Vanessa cardui. Its primary
   structure was assigned by Edman degradation and

   (Vac-AKH). Vac-AKH represents the first 11mer and the first nonamidated
   peptide in this family.
   The peptide shows significant adipokinetic activity in adult specimens
   of V. cardui. Injection of 10 pmol of synthetic Vac-AKH into 4-day-old
   decapitated males resulted in an approximate to 150\% increase of
   hemolymph lipids after 90 min. Half maximal adipokinetic activity was
   achieved with about 0.1 pmol of Vac-AKH. During a 2-h incubation of
   corpora cardiaca/corpora allata complexes in medium containing 50 mm
   KCl, significant amounts of Vac-AKH were released from the glands.}},

Abstract = {{Desflurane is not used for the induction of anaesthesia despite its
   favourable pharmacokinetic characteristics because it causes airway

   to three groups (60 per group) to receive i.v. saline, fentanyl l mu g
   kg(-1) and morphine 0.1 mg kg(-1), respectively, before inhalational
   induction with desflurane in nitrous oxide and oxygen. Mean time to loss
   of response to commands was 4.0 min, without significant differences
   between groups. The incidence of coughing was greater (25\%) in the
   control group than in the fentanyl (5.0\%) and morphine groups (8.3\%).
   The incidence of apnoea was 20.0\% in the control group versus 13.3 and
   5.0\% in the fentanyl and morphine groups, respectively. Laryngospasm
   developed in 11.7\% of controls compared with 3.3 and 1.7\% in the

Abstract = {{We obtain a criterion for quadratic Veronese varieties. We prove that in
   the set of smooth n-dimensional submanifolds of the projective space PN
   of dimension N = n(n + 3)/2 only the Veronese varieties have the
   following two properties: (i) the tangent projective spaces at any two
   points intersect in a point, (ii) the osculating projective space at
   every point coincides with the ambient space. This result is a
   generalization to arbitrary n of the criterion for two-dimensional
   Veronese surfaces in P-5 proved by Griffiths and Harris. We also find a
   criterion for a pair of submanifolds of P-N to be contained in the same
   Veronese variety. We obtain calculation formulae that enable one to use
   these criteria in practice.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To determine the Frequency and associated features of severe
   CD4 + T-lymphocytopenia ( < 300 cells/mm(3)) in HIV-seronegative
   patients with tuberculosis,
   Methods: Statistical analysis of 430 consecutively enrolled
   HIV-seronegative inpatients with tuberculosis in two teaching hospitals
   in Dakar, Senegal,
   Results: The mean CD4+ cell count was 602 +/- 318.3 cells/mm(3). CD4+
   cell counts were below 300 cells/mm3 in 62 patients (14.4\%), Patients
   with fewer than 300 CD4+ cells/mm3 differed from those with higher
   counts in being Less likely to have a positive smear for acid-fast
   bacilli; in having a higher frequency of extrapulmonary involvement
   (pleural effusion, adenopathy and miliary disease) and oral candidiasis;
   and in having smaller tuberculin reactions, lower haemoglobin levels,
   less cavitation and less patchy infiltration. After adjustment for
   gender and age, all differences remained except miliary disease.
   Conclusions: A substantial percentage (14.4\%) of HIV-seronegative
   hospitalized patients for tuberculosis in a West African country
   presented with severe CD4+T-lymphocyte depletion and had clinical and
   radiographic features indicative of more advanced disease and
   accompanying immunodepression, These results and those already published
   suggest that tuberculosis should be regarded as one of the diseases
   associated with a subgroup of patients with ``idiopathic CD4+
   T-lymphocytopenia{''}. (C) 2000 The British Infection Society.}},

   within the Mayak worker cohort, which evaluate the role of plutonium
   body burden with adjustment for cumulative external dose, indicate
   excess mortality among workers with burdens estimated to exceed 7.4 kBq

   plutonium plant who did not have routine plutonium monitoring data based
   on urine measurements (relative risk = 4.1; 95\% CI = 1.2-14), In
   addition, analyses treating the estimated plutonium body burden as a
   continuous variable indicate increasing risk with increasing burden (P <
   0.001). Because of limitations In current plutonium dosimetry, no
   attempt was made to quantify bone cancer risks from plutonium in terms
   of organ dose, and risk from external dose could not be reliably
   evaluated. (C) 2000 by Radiation Research Society.}},

   of variance of gene frequencies and F-statistics showed high levels of
   gene now within each region and between the Texan and northern United
   States populations, but negligible rates of gene now between these and
   the Honduran populations. Thus, gene now was largely unrestricted in
   North American C. maculata. Honduras populations were highly
   differentiated genetically from the North American populations and
   shared with North American beetles only 41 of 70 alleles at 14 allozyme
   loci. Nei's genetic distances within Honduran, Texas, and Iowa-New
   England samples did not differ significantly from zero, but the
   intergroup distances were large. Reciprocal crosses within and between
   Texas and Iowan populations were fertile, but reciprocal crosses between
   Honduran and North American strains were completely sterile. No
   consistent morphological differences between North and Central American

Abstract = {{The incidence of incontinence after radical prostatectomy has ranged
   from 0 to 57\% depending on the series and the type of incontinence
   considered, When total incontinence (not minimal stress incontinence) is
   reported, the average incidence is no more than 5\%. This figure will
   increase with age, and in most series, approximately 10\% of patients
   around the age of 70 will have total incontinence postoperatively.
   Preservation of continence after radical prostatectomy depends largely
   on the preservation of the distal urethral smooth-muscle sphincteric
   mechanism, which begins at the pelvic floor and ends at the
   prostatourethral junction. Newer techniques that attempt to increase
   postoperative continence include not cutting the puboprostatic ligaments
   and attempting to preserve as much striated muscle as possible along the
   length of the remaining urethra. Patients who are incontinent for 6
   months after the surgery with no evidence of improvement will probably
   not become continent on their own. Therefore, some type of therapy
   should be considered. The options are periurethral injection of a
   bulking agent, implantation of an artificial sphincter, and, most
   recently, a bulbourethral sling procedure.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of tillage and nitrogen (N) application method on the spatial
   variation on leaching losses was evaluated using eight, 1-m(3)
   undisturbed soil monoliths. Monoliths were collected in 1992 from
   research plots with 15 years of continuous tillage and crop rotation
   history. Tillage practices imposed in the field were moldboard plow,
   chisel, or ridge tillage. Anion tracers were applied to simulate
   applying N as a surface broadcast, in a slot with surface compaction,
   and with water: A rainfall simulator was used to apply 100 mm of water
   followed 24 h later by an additional application of 430 mm to establish
   tracer concentrations over a range of drainage. Drainage was collected
   at the bottom of each monolith using fiberglass wick extractors placed
   in a 6 x 6 grid of 90 mm x 90 mm cells. Tracer leaching losses and
   flow-weighted concentrations were calculated from the initial flush of
   water through 24 h after water application. No significant differences
   were noted for cumulative drainage distribution curves or for the depth
   of drainage produced (p < 0.05). However in all cases, the cumulative
   distribution curves were above the I:I line, indicating that drainage
   from some cells was greater than others. Spatial analysis indicated that
   drainage was randomly distributed across the monolith. Tracer leaching
   losses were not significantly different among tillage treatments or
   tracer application methods for either water application event. However
   results for the slot with surface compaction treatment suggest that 10
   times more NO3-N from moldboard plow treatment in comparison with the
   ridge tillage treatment. Trends in leaching losses for the SLOT (Br)
   with surface compaction treatment suggested that a tracer leaching
   pattern existed directly below the application zone. Tracer
   concentrations peaked above 350 mg L-1 after 100 to 170 mm of drainage
   for the SLOT (Br) with surface compaction application method and final
   concentrations remained above 70 mg L-1. Peak concentrations for the
   surface broadcast (BROAD) and with water application (WATER) methods
   peaked at less than 110 mg L-1 and were consistent among monoliths.
   Spatial analysis indicated that leaching losses were randomly
   distributed. Data supported an assertion that the moldboard plow tillage
   treatment combined with the slot with surface compaction (SLOT)
   application of N should be avoided.}},

Abstract = {{Regulation of eukaryotic gene expression requires ATP-dependent

   mitotic exit. In contrast, interphase expression of GAL1, HIS3, PHO5,
   and PHO8 is accompanied by SWI/SNF-independent recruitment of Gcn5p HAT
   activity. Surprisingly, prearresting cells in late mitosis imposes a
   requirement for SWI/SNF in recruiting Gcn5p HAT activity to the GAL1
   promoter, and GAL1 expression also becomes dependent on both chromatin
   remodeling enzymes. We propose that SWI/SNF and Gcn5p are globally
   required for mitotic gene expression due to the condensed state of
   mitotic chromatin.}},

Abstract = {{Once thought to be dominated by a few genets, clonal plant populations
   can contain high levels of genetic diversity. Sexual reproduction and
   vegetative growth strategy affect the amount and distribution of genetic
   diversity within clonal plant populations. We determined the scale of
   genetic diversity in a population of Vaccinium stamineum, a clonal shrub
   that forms discrete patches. Using the random amplified polymorphic DNA
   (RAPD) technique, we surveyed the genetic diversity of V. stamineum
   within and among patches from a 1-ha site. We found 67 unique RAPD
   profiles among the 99 sampled individuals from 22 patches. In two
   patches, all the sampled individuals had the same RAPD profile. In seven
   patches, every individual sampled had a different RAPD profile. The
   remaining patches showed mixed RAPD profiles which suggested both clonal
   and sexual reproduction. Each unique RAPD profile was restricted to one
   patch (with one exception), which suggests that clonal growth occurs at
   the patch scale. High levels of genetic variation within some patches
   may be explained by somatic mutation; however, seedling recruitment is a
   more likely explanation.}},

   of silica (mean particle size, d(p),= 38 mu m) and polystyrene (mean
   particle size, d(p) = 570 mu m) and in water. The rise velocity of
   single gas bubbles in the size range d(b) = 0.015-0.12 m were found to
   decrease significantly with increasing ratio of bubble diameter to bed
   width, d(b)/D-T. Computational fluid dynamics simulations of single gas
   bubbles rising in water, carried out using the volume-of-fluid (VOF)
   method, showed good agreement with experiment and were used to develop a
   common expression for the rise velocity of single gas bubbles in

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the lower limit of pitch for complex,
   harmonic sounds, like the notes produced by low-pitched musical
   instruments. The lower limit of pitch is investigated by measuring rate
   discrimination thresholds for harmonic tones filtered into 1.2-kHz-wide
   bands with a lower cutoff frequency, F-c, ranging from 0.2 to 6.4 kHz.
   When F-c, is below 1 kHz and the harmonics are in cosine phase, rate
   discrimination threshold exhibits a rapid, tenfold decrease as the
   repetition rate is increased from 16 to 64 Hz, and over this range, the
   perceptual quality of the stimuli changes from flutter to pitch. When
   F-c is increased above 1 kHz, the slope of the transition from high to
   low thresholds becomes shallower and occurs at progressively higher
   rates. A quantitative comparison of the cosine-phase thresholds with
   subjective estimates of the existence region of pitch from the
   literature shows that the transition in rate discrimination occurs at
   approximately the same rate as the lower limit of pitch. The rate
   discrimination experiment was then repeated with alternating-phase
   harmonic tones whose envelopes repeat at twice the repetition rate of
   the waveform. In this case, when F-c is below 1 kHz, the transition in
   rate discrimination is shifted downward by almost an octave relative to
   the transition in the cosine-phase thresholds. The results support the
   hypothesis that in the low-frequency region, the pitch limit is
   determined by a temporal mechanism, which analyzes time intervals
   between peaks in the neural activity pattern. It seems that temporal
   processing of pitch is limited to rime intervals less than 33 ms,
   corresponding to a pitch limit of about 30 Hz. (C) 2000 Acoustical

Abstract = {{Dipyridamole is used for secondary prophylaxis in ischemic stroke and as
   a vasodilator agent in myocardial scintigraphy. An important side effect
   to administering dipyridamole is headache. The aim of the current study
   was to investigate the effects of dipyridamole on cerebral blood flow,
   large artery diameter, and headache induction. Twelve healthy subjects
   were included in this single-blind placebo-controlled study in which
   placebo (0.9\% NaCl) and dipyridamole 0.142 mg/kg.min were administered
   intravenously over 4 minutes 1 hour apart. Blood flow velocity in the
   middle cerebral artery (V-mca) was recorded by transcranial Doppler and
   regional cerebral blood flow in the middle cerebral artery (rCBF(mcu))
   was measured using single photon emission computed tomography and
   (133)Xenon-inhalation. Blood pressure, heart rate, and pCO(2) were
   measured repeatedly. Headache response was scored every 10 minutes on a
   verbal scale from 0 to 10 (10 = worst). Dipyridamole caused a decrease
   in pCO(2) (P < 0.001). pCO(2) corrected rCBF(mca) was 11.7 +/- 6.9
   mL/100 g min after placebo versus 31.2 +/- 6.9 after dipyridamole (P
   greater than or equal to 0.05). pCO(2) corrected V-mca decreased 8.4\%
   +/- 11.7 (P < 0.001) after dipyridamole, indicating a mean 5.6\% +/- 6.7
   (P = 0.005) relative increase of the arterial diameter. After
   dipyridamole the median peak headache score was 2 (range 0 to 7)
   compared with 0 (range 0 to 3) after placebo (P = 0,02). Dilatation of
   the middle cerebral artery outlasted the headache response. In
   conclusion, dipyridamole causes a modest pCO(2) independent dilatation
   of the MCA, which is time-linked to the onset, but not to the cessation,
   of headache.}},

Abstract = {{We study a class of dissipative nonlinear PDE's forced by a random force
   eta(omega)(t, x), with the space variable x varying in a bounded domain.
   The class contains the 2D Navier-Stokes equations (under periodic or
   Dirichlet boundary conditions), and the forces we consider are those
   common in statistical hydrodynamics: they are random fields smooth in x
   and stationary, short-correlated in time t. In this paper, we confine
   ourselves to ``kick forces{''} of the form
   eta(omega)(t, x) = (k=-infinity)Sigma(+infinity) delta(t - kT)eta(k)(x),
   where the eta(k)'s are smooth bounded identically distributed random
   fields. The equation in question defines a Markov chain in an
   appropriately chosen phase space (a subset of a function space) that
   contains the zero function and is invariant for the (random) how of the
   equation, Concerning this Markov chain, we prove the following main
   result (see Theorem 2.2): The Markov chain has a unique invariant
   measure. To prove this theorem, we present a construction assigning, to
   any invariant measure, a Gibbs measure for a 1D system with compact
   phase space and apply a version of Ruelle-Perron-Frobenius uniqueness
   theorem to the corresponding Gibbs system. We also discuss ergodic
   properties of the invariant measure and corresponding properties of the
   original randomly forced PDE.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Rupture of a cystic craniopharyngioma is a rare phenomenon.
   The rupture of the cyst causes decompression of the adjacent neural
   structures resulting in spontaneous improvement of the visual symptoms
   or level of sensorium. The leakage of its contents into the subarachnoid
   space gives rise to meningismus. We report an extremely rare phenomenon
   of an intraventricular rupture of a cystic craniopharyngioma, which
   resulted in acute neurological deterioration and chemical ventriculitis.
   CASE DESCRIPTION
   A 38-year-old lady presented with a 1-year history of frontal lobe
   dysfunction and bilateral primary optic atrophy. The CT scan showed a
   multi-loculated, hyperdense lesion in the region of the third ventricle
   and suprasellar cistern. She suffered acute deterioration of
   neurological status; computed tomography (CT) scan showed a hypodense
   lesion in the suprasellar cistern with persistent hydrocephalus. She was
   treated with ventricular drainage, steroids and anticonvulsants.
   Ventricular fluid showed high cholesterol and LDH levels. The diagnosis
   of craniopharyngioma was subsequently verified histologically.
   CONCLUSIONS
   The intraventricular rupture of a cystic craniopharyngioma can result in
   acute clinical deterioration and morbidity because of chemical
   ventriculitis. This is unlike the rupture in the subarachnoid space or
   sphenoid sinus which usually results in symptomatic improvement,
   although chemical meningitis may occur. This rare phenomenon should be
   recognized, and prompt ventricular drainage is advised. The literature
   is reviewed, and management of this condition is discussed. (C) 2000 by

   fed neither. The gel electrophoretic protein profiles and DNA and RNA
   contents in these three sets were studied. Methods: Protein profiles
   were studied by SDS-PAGE method; the DNA and RNA contents were assayed
   by the standard methods through diphenylamine and orcinol reactions
   respectively. Results: arsenic trioxide injection produced some
   pathological conditions, drastic changes (mainly reduction of protein
   bands) in protein sub-fractions, reduced DNA and RNA contents in both
   liver and testis;Ars.Alb-30-fed arsenic-intoxicated mice showed revival
   and restoration in both liver and testis as revealed by gel patterns and

Abstract = {{Objectives To describe subretinal fibrosis as a long-term complication
   of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease.
   Design: Retrospective, clinic-based, cross-sectional study and clinical
   correlation.
   Participants: Ten patients with VKH disease and subretinal fibrosis were
   seen at two uveitis referral centers between 1977 and 1997.
   Interventions A review of the historical, clinical, and fluorescein
   angiographic features was performed.
   Main Outcome Measures: The prevalence, demographic and clinical
   features, and time to development of subretinal fibrosis were
   summarized.
   Results: Subretinal fibrosis occurred in 20 eyes of 10 patients with VKH
   disease, an overall prevalence of 8\% between the two institutions.
   Patient age ranged from 16 years to 48 years, with a median of 34.5
   years. Five patients were Hispanic, one was mixed Hispanic and American
   Indian, three were Asian or mixed Asian and Caucasian, and one was
   African-American. Eight of the 10 patients were men. All patients were
   in the chronic, recurrent phase of their disease when they had
   subretinal fibrosis develop, and all patients had recurrent episodes of
   posterior uveitis. Presenting vision ranged from 20/20 to light
   perception, with a median acuity of 20/200. All patients were initially
   treated with oral and topical corticosteroids. Four patients required
   additional noncorticosteroid immunosuppressive therapy. Time from
   diagnosis of VKH disease to development of subretinal fibrosis ranged
   from zero (fibrosis present at time of diagnosis) to 27 years, with a
   median time of 10 months. The median time from diagnosis of VKH to
   development of subretinal fibrosis in Hispanic patients was 6.5 months,
   whereas in non-Hispanic patients it was 6.5 years. Final vision ranged
   from 20/25 to light perception, with a median acuity of 20/60. Seven of
   20 eyes had a final visual acuity of 20/40 or better, and seven eyes saw
   20/200 or worse. Five of the eyes with 20/200 or worse vision had
   fibrosis involving the fovea.
   Conclusions: Subretinal fibrosis occurs in a sizeable proportion of
   patients with VKH disease and may contribute to permanent loss of
   vision. Ophthalmology 2000;107:1721-1728 (C) 2000 by the American

Abstract = {{We have previously reported that the doxorubicin (DOX) binding ability
   detected by the DOX (or adriamycin) binding assay closely correlated
   with the chemosensitivity of human osteosarcomas (1). We performed the
   present study to clarify the relationship between the DOX binding
   ability (\%DB) and the histologic response, rate of decrease in armor
   volume of malignant soft tissue tumors after preoperative chemotherapy
   and prognosis. Nine malignant soft tissue tumors (4 liposarcomas, 3
   synovial sarcomas, one malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) and one
   extraskeletal osteosarcoma (EOS)) which arose at the extremities of
   adult patients were analyzed by the DOX binding assay using freshly
   biopsied specimens. After preoperative chemotherapy including DOX or
   pirarubicin (THP), the rate of decrease in tumor volume was measured
   using magnetic resonance imaging, and the histologic response expressed
   as tumor necrosis to chemotherapy was also investigated. All the
   patients, apart for one, were continuously disease-free after treatment.
   One patient with EOS died of metastatic disease before surgery. The
   histologic response in 8 tumors without EOS was poor: The \%DB of 5
   tumors was greater than 80\% (average: 95.90\%), whereas that of 4
   tumors was less than 80\% (average: 38.33\%). Although there was no
   correlation between the \%DB and the histologic response, or prognosis,
   a significantly positive can elation was found between the \%DB and the
   rate of decrease in tumor volume (r = 0.7455, p< 0.05). These results
   suggest that in malignant soft tissue tumors, the rate of decrease in
   tumor volume after chemotherapy might be a better indicator for
   chemosensitivity than the histologic response and also that the DOX
   binding ability might be a good predict for chemosensitivity before
   chemotherapy.}},

Abstract = {{The widespread biological actions of the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA)
   are mediated by two classes of receptor, the D-1 class (D-1 and D-5) and
   the D-2 class (D-2, D-3, and D-4), which interact synergistically in
   many paradigms, such as DA agonist-stimulated motor behavior and
   striatal c-fos expression. Understanding the mechanism(s) of this
   interaction has been impeded by a controversy regarding the cellular
   localization of D-1 and D-2 class receptors. To address this issue from
   a functional point of view, we elicited striatal Fos by combined
   administration of a D-1 class and a D-2 class agonist either in the
   presence or absence of the fast sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin
   (TTX). Striatal Fos elicited by direct D-1/D-2 stimulation was not
   reduced by TTX. By contrast, TTX greatly attenuated the Fos response
   evoked by cocaine or GBR 12909. In separate experiments using
   antagonists that distinguish among members of the D-2 class of
   receptors, amphetamine-stimulated Fos and motor behavior were attenuated
   dose-dependently by the selective D-2 antagonist L-741,626, but not by
   the selective D-3 antagonist U99194A or the D-4-selective antagonist
   L-745,870. Because Fos expression in the paradigms that were used occurs
   in enkephalin-negative striatonigral neurons, which show limited
   coexpression of D-1 and D-2 receptors, the present findings taken
   together suggest the intriguing possibility that D-1/D-2 synergism may
   be mediated by D-1 and D-2 receptors residing on separate striatal
   neurons and interacting in a manner that is not dependent on action
   potentials.}},

Abstract = {{To facilitate routine health risk assessments, we develop the concept of
   an inhalation transfer factor (ITF). The ITF is defined as the pollutant
   mass inhaled by an exposed individual per unit pollutant mass emitted
   from an air pollution source. A cumulative population inhalation
   transfer factor (PITF) is also defined to describe the total fraction of
   an emitted pollutant inhaled by all members of the exposed population.
   In this paper, ITFs and PITFs are calculated for outdoor releases from
   area, point, and line sources, indoor releases in single zone and
   multizone indoor environments, and releases within motor vehicles.
   Typical PITFs for an urban area from emissions outdoors are similar to
   10(-6)-10(-3). PITFs associated with emissions in buildings or in moving
   vehicles are typically much higher, similar to 10(-3)-10(-1).}},

Abstract = {{A statistical formalism overcoming some conceptual and practical
   difficulties arising in existing two-phase flow (2PHF) mathematical
   modelling has been applied to propose a model for dilute 2PHF turbulent
   flows. Phase interaction terms with a clear physical meaning enter the
   equations and the formalism provides some guidelines for the avoidance
   of closure assumptions or the rational approximation of these terms.
   Continuous phase averaged continuity, momentum, turbulent kinetic energy
   and turbulence dissipation rate equations have been rigorously and
   systematically obtained in a single step. These equations display a
   structure similar to that for single-phase flows. It is also assumed
   that dispersed phase dynamics is well described by a probability density
   function (pdf) equation and Eulerian continuity, momentum and
   fluctuating kinetic energy equations for the dispersed phase are
   deduced. An extension of the standard k-epsilon turbulence model for the
   continuous phase is used. A gradient transport model is adopted for the
   dispersed phase fluctuating fluxes of momentum and kinetic energy at the
   non-colliding, large inertia limit. This model is then used to predict
   the behaviour of three axisymmetric turbulent jets of air laden with
   solid particles varying in size and concentration. Qualitative and
   quantitative numerical predictions compare reasonably well with the
   three different sets of experimental results, studying the influence of
   particle size, loading ratio and flow confinement velocity.}},

   clinical course of the disease. This study reports on 14 cases of
   primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas of the lower limbs and their clinical
   course. A study of integrin expression by tumour cells was performed in
   11 of these cases. With a mean follow-up of 31 months, the study
   confirmed the worse prognosis of lymphomas with a predominance of
   centroblasts and immunoblasts (3 deaths) compared with lymphomas with a
   predominance of centrocytes, as well as their higher rate of recurrence

Abstract = {{Many real-time database systems (RTDBS) are used to support
   mission-critical applications such as avionics control systems and
   defense systems, in which transactions have stringent real-time
   constraints. In these hard real-time systems, a transaction missing its
   deadline could lead to catastrophic consequences. The difficulties of
   providing a guarantee of meeting transaction deadlines in hard RTDBS lie
   in the problems of priority inversion and deadlocks. The transaction
   blocking delay due to priority inversion can be unbounded, which is
   unacceptable in most hard RTDBS. Several priority ceiling protocols
   have: been proposed to solve these two problems. However, they are too
   conservative in scheduling transactions for the single-blocking and
   deadlock-free properties, leading to many unnecessary transaction
   blockings. The main reason for their conservatism is their implicit
   assumption that if a transaction's operation conflicts with that of
   another executing transaction, it is presumably unable to preempt the
   conflicting transaction. In this paper, we propose a new priority
   ceiling protocol that allows a higher priority transaction to preempt a
   lower priority transaction on data conflicts by using the notion of
   dynamic adjustment of serialization order. We devise a worst-case
   schedulability analysis for the new protocol which provides a better
   schedulability condition compared to other protocols. The simulation
   results show that the new priority ceiling protocol outperforms other
   protocols. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{As in many places in the world, water in South Asia is a source of
   conflict. In mountainous and underpopulated areas it is in abundance,
   but rare in densely inhabited areas of plains and tablelands; it
   therefore creates tensions among the states of the sub-continent as well
   as within the states themselves.
   From their creation in 1947, India and Pakistan quarrelled over sharing
   the waters of the Indus and its tributaries. The treaty of 1960,
   concluded with the help of the World Bank and signed by the two
   countries, put an end to tensions which were becoming dangerous as they
   involved highly populated agricultural areas. It was a considerable
   achievement, even if some problems remain, particularly in Kashmir.
   Between India and Bangladesh, disagreements are still in evidence,
   despite the conclusion of an agreement in 1996 over the sharing of the
   Ganges waters. The development of the Brahmaputra basin also fosters
   misunderstandings between these two countries, to which China is not
   indifferent. The harnessing with India of the main Nepalese rivers,
   particularly the Mahakali delineating the frontier, gives birth to
   nationalist reactions within the Himalayan kingdom.
   The displacement of populations, often tribals ones, and the
   construction of big dams sometimes generates sharp debates between
   provinces in India, in Pakistan, and in Sri Lanka. The need to develop
   irrigation and electricity power, in order to match a sharp population
   increase, is sometimes detrimental to the protection of the environment.
   The public interest may be at variance with the private interest.}},

   their scaling laws are different. The flow intensity decreases linearly
   with the rotation speed, or Ta-1/2, but quadratically with the magnetic
   field, or Ha(-2). Under an axial magnetic field, the effect of rotation
   becomes less significant due to the reduced angular velocity gradients.

Abstract = {{Tumour-specific vascularisation may be therapeutically approached in two
   different ways. by antiangiogenic treatments specifically directed to
   dividing and migrating endothelial cells, or by agents that target
   principally the inadequate and ill-structured tumour vasculature.
   Combretastatin A-4 phosphate (combreAp), a recently synthesised prodrug
   (OXiGENE, Lund, Sweden), is a vascular targeting agent of the latter
   kind. We evaluated the effect of a single intraperitoneal (i.p.)
   combreAp injection on the growth of rhabdomyosarcomas syngeneic in
   WAG/Rij rats. Different tumour volume groups, ranging between 0.1 and 27
   cm(3), were selected to assess the relationship between the size at
   treatment time and the response to combreAp. A double combreAp treatment
   (2x25 mg/kg) was investigated within the same overall aim: the
   relationship between growth delay and tumour size. Our results show that
   the systemic administration of combreAp induces a clear-cut differential
   growth delay in the solid rat rhabdomyosarcomas, with very large tumours
   (greater than or equal to 14 cm(3)), a 17.6-fold stronger effect was
   measured than with very small tumours(< 1 cm(3)). This is the `inverse'
   of the volume-response seen with the conventional therapeutic approaches
   (radiotherapy, chemotherapy or surgery). These combreAp antitumour
   responses were observed without treatment limiting systemic toxicity in
   the rats. With clinical digital subtraction angiography, using
   microsurgical cannulation of a major tumour draining vessel, and with
   histopathology, we demonstrate that growth delay is related to an early
   (within 3-6 h) and extensive breakdown of tumour blood vessels. The
   experiments involving a second injection also indicate a
   volume-dependent effect of combreAp in reducing the regrowth rate of
   small or large rhabdomyosarcomas. This significant differential
   volume-response obtained with `selective' vascular targeting, stronger
   in larger tumours than smaller ones, suggests the potential of
   broadening the therapeutic window. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A new fate map for mesodermal tissues in Xenopus laevis predicted that
   the prime meridian, which runs from the animal pole to the vegetal pole
   through the center of Spemann's organizer, is the embryo's anterior
   midline, not its dorsal midline (M. C. Lane and W. C. Smith, 1999,
   Development 126, 423-434). In this report, we demonstrate by lineage
   labeling that the column 1 blastomeres at st. 6, which populate the
   prime meridian, give rise to the anterior end of the embryo. In
   addition, we surgically isolate and culture tissue centered on this
   meridian from early gastrulae. This tissue forms a patterned head with
   morphologically distinct ventral and dorsal structures. In situ
   hybridization and immunostaining reveal that the cultured heads contain
   the anterior tissues of all three germ layers, correctly patterned.
   Regardless of how we dissect early gastrulae along meridians running
   from the animal to the vegetal pole, both the formation of head
   structures and the expression of anterior marker genes always segregate
   with the prime meridian passing through Spemann's organizer. The prime
   meridian also gives rise to dorsal, axial mesoderm, but not uniquely, as
   specification tests show that dorsal mesoderm arises in fragments of the
   embryo which exclude the prime meridian. These results support the
   hypothesis that the midline that bisects Spemann's organizer is the
   embryo's anterior midline. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Accurate localization of acute ischemic lesions in patients
   with an acute stroke may aid in understanding the etiology of their
   stroke and ma) improve the management of these patients.
   Objective: To determine the field of adding diffusion-weighted magnetic
   resonance imaging (DWI) to a conventional magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) protocol for acute stroke.
   Design: A prospective cohort study.
   Setting: A referral center.
   Patients and Methods: Fifty-two patients with a clinical diagnosis of
   acute stroke who presented within 48 hours after symptom onset were
   included. An MRI scan was obtained within 48 hours after symptom onset.
   A neuroradiologist (A.M.N.) and a stroke neurologist (G.W.A.)
   independently identified suspected acute ischemic lesions on MRI
   sequences in the following order: (1) T2-weighted and proton
   density-weighted images, (2) fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images,
   and (3) diffusion-weighted images and apparent diffusion coefficient
   maps.
   Main Outcome Measures: Diagnostic yield and interrater reliability for
   the identification of acute lesions, and confidence and conspicuity
   ratings of acute lesions for different MRI sequences.
   Results: Conventional MRI correctly identified at least one acute lesion
   in 71\% (34/48) to 80\% (39/49) of patients who had an acute stroke,
   with the addition of DWI, this percentage increased to 94\% (46/49)
   (P<.001). Conventional MRI showed only moderate sensitivity (50\%-60\%)
   and specificity (49\%-69\%) compared with a ``criterion standard.{''}
   Based on the diffusion-weighted sequence, interrater reliability for
   identifying acute lesions was moderate for conventional MRI
   (kappa=0.5-0.6) and good for DWI (kappa=0.8). The observers' confidence
   with which lesions were rated as acute and the lesion conspicuity was
   significantly (P<.01) higher for DWI than for conventional MRI.
   Conclusion: During the first 48 hours after symptom onset, the addition
   of DWI to conventional MRI improves the accuracy of identifying acute
   ischemic brain lesions in patients who experienced a stroke.}},

Abstract = {{During the last 2 decades, we have gained new insights into the
   pathogenesis of asthma; consequently, new therapeutic agents and
   approaches to therapy have emerged. Nevertheless, significant gaps
   remain in our understanding of this disease. Important new treatment
   issues affect childhood (the usual time of asthma onset), and
   researchers have recently described increases in asthma incidence in
   children. Yet, most clinical studies have been performed with adults,
   and our knowledge about major determinants of childhood asthma remains
   incomplete. Major challenges in pediatric asthma include methods of
   easily assessing Lung function and noninvasive methods of assessing
   asthma's inflammatory nature. Research that addresses the mechanisms
   responsible for disease onset is also critical to decrease the
   prevalence of asthma. What we know about adult asthma cannot be used in
   the treatment of children without further study, but it is now clear
   that effective treatment should begin during childhood.}},

Abstract = {{A monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM) culture assay was used to define the
   replication culture assay was used to define the replication kinetics of
   HN isolates. Ten-day-old MDMs were infected with HIV, Supernatants were
   collected and assayed for HIV p24 on days 3, 7, 10, and 14
   post-infection (PI). In this assay, SF162 (macrophage tropic, NSI)
   produced increasing amounts of HIV p24 antigen. with increasing time in
   culture. BRU (nonmacrophage tropic, SI) infection resulted in low levels
   of HIV p24 antigen with no increase in production during the culture
   period. A panel of 12 clinical isolates was evaluated. All isolates
   produced detectable levels of HIV p24 antigen in MDMs. However, the NSI
   viruses had significantly higher log(10) HIV p24 antigen values at all
   times PI (P < 0.01). Co-receptor usage was determined for all 12
   isolates (8 NSI and 4 SI). All SI isolates used CXCR4 for entry; two
   used CXCR4 only, one used CXCR4, CCR5, and CCR3, and one was a mixture
   of two isolates using CXCR4 and CCR5. None of the NSI viruses used CXCR4
   for entry. All used CCR5 as their predominant coreceptor. Of the eight
   NSI isolates, three used CCR5 only, two used CCR5 and CCR2b, one used
   CCR5 and CCR3, and one used CCR5, CCR3, and CCR2b, Log(10) HIV p24
   antigen production on day 14 PI for viruses that used CCR5+CCR3 (3.19 +
   1.40) was greater than for viruses that used CCR5+CCR2b (3.22 + 1.55) or
   CCR5 (3.32 + 1.49), and all were greater than those that used CXCR4 only
   (1.69 + 0.28), regardless of SI phenotype (P < 0.05). Thus, in these
   primary isolates, macrophage tropism and replication kinetics were
   closely linked to CCR5 utilization, whereas SI capacity was closely
   linked to CXCR4 utilization, Furthermore, viruses, which could use CCRS
   and CCR3 for entry, had a replication advantage in macrophages,
   regardless of SI phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{Background: A concern with hierarchy messages, which promote male
   condoms and female-controlled barrier methods along a prevention
   continuum, is that they may discourage condom use.
   Goal: To measure male-condom and female-condom use among women who
   received hierarchy counseling and compare this with women counseled
   about condoms only,
   Study Design: Three observational cohorts that correspond to prevention
   message received were assembled, and consisted of female sexually
   transmitted disease clinic patients who were counseled about male
   condoms, female condoms, or a hierarchy message. The hierarchy message
   promoted male and female condoms, the diaphragm and cervical cap,
   spermicides, and withdrawal, in descending order of effectiveness
   against sexually transmitted diseases. After counseling, women were
   interviewed and returned for follow-up visits at 2 weeks, 4 months, and
   6 months. The outcome was the mean proportion of male condom- or female
   condom-protected coital acts at each follow-up visit in the hierarchy
   cohort. The outcome was dichotomized as high (greater than or equal to
   70\% of coital acts protected) or low (< 70\%), and generalized
   estimating equations were used to compare observed follow-up condom use
   with baseline within the hierarchy cohort and observed follow-up condom
   use between cohorts. It was assumed that condom use in persons not
   present at 6 months was equal to baseline levels, and condom use
   estimates were calculated for each full cohort that was initially
   enrolled.
   Results: The mean proportion of condom-protected coital acts in the
   hierarchy cohort was significantly increased from baseline at each
   follow-up visit. There were no differences in observed condom use during
   follow up between the hierarchy cohort and either the male-condom or the
   female-condom cohort. However, when the full cohort initially enrolled
   was considered, 6-month condom use was significantly higher in the
   hierarchy cohort than in the male-condom cohort.
   Conclusion: Hierarchy counseling was associated with a significant
   increase in condom use. Our findings suggest that offering a choice of
   male and female condoms results in increased protection over counseling
   in male condoms alone.}},

   Competitive PCR showed means +/- standard deviations of 20.1 +/- 22.6 T.

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: The overall aims of the ADDITION study are to evaluate
   whether screening for prevalent undiagnosed Type 2 diabetes is feasible,
   and whether subsequent optimised intensive treatment of diabetes, and
   associated risk factors, is feasible and beneficial.
   DESIGN: Population-based screening in three European countries followed
   by an open, randomised controlled trial,
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS: People aged 40-69 y in the community, without
   known diabetes, will be offered a random capillary blood glucose
   screening test by their primary care physicians, followed, if equal to
   or greater than 5.5 mmol/l, by fasting and 2-h post-glucose-challenge
   blood glucose measurements. Three thousand newly diagnosed patients will
   subsequently receive conventional treatment (according to current
   national guidelines) or intensive multifactorial treatment (lifestyle
   advice, prescription of aspirin and ACE-inhibitors, in addition to
   protocol-driven tight control of blood glucose, blood pressure and
   cholesterol). Patients allocated to intensive treatment will be further
   randomised to centre-specific interventions to motivate adherence to
   lifestyle changes and medication. Duration of follow-up is planned for 5
   y. Endpoints will include mortality, macrovascular and microvascular
   complications, patient health status and satisfaction, process-of-care
   indicators and costs.}},

Abstract = {{Heterochromatin is characteristically the last portion of the genome to
   be replicated. In polytene cells, heterochromatic sequences are
   underreplicated because S phase ends before replication of
   heterochromatin is completed. Truncated heterochromatic DNAs have been
   identified in polytene cells of Drosophila and may be the discontinuous
   molecules that form between fully replicated euchromatic and
   underreplicated heterochromatic regions of the chromosome. In this
   report, we characterize the temporal pattern of heterochromatic DNA
   truncation during development of polytene cells. Underreplication
   occurred during the first polytene S phase, yet DNA truncation, which
   was found within heterochromatic sequences of all four Drosophila
   chromosomes, did not occur until the second polytene S phase, DNA
   truncation was correlated with underreplication, since increasing the
   replication of satellite sequences with the cycE(1672) mutation caused
   decreased production of truncated DNAs. Finally, truncation of
   heterochromatic DNAs was neither quantitatively nor qualitatively
   affected by modifiers of position effect variegation including the Y
   chromosome, Su(var)205(2), parental origin, or temperature. We propose
   that heterochromatic satellite sequences present a barrier to DNA
   replication and that replication forks that transiently stall at such
   barriers in late S phase of diploid cells are left unresolved in the
   shortened S phase of polytene cells. DNA truncation then occurs in the
   second polytene S phase, when new replication forks extend to the
   position of forks left unresolved in the first polytene S phase.}},

   family practice residents. We have used the reflecting team approach in
   our longitudinal behavioral health program for 6 years. Our purpose in
   using this approach is to 1) teach listening and interviewing skills, 2)
   teach systems-oriented psychosocial interventions, and 3) provide
   behavioral health consultations for patients. Methods: A five-item,
   self-administered open-ended questionnaire evaluating the reflecting
   team approach was administered to a sample of family practice residents
   participating in the longitudinal behavioral health program ( a response
   rate of 82\%). Responses to the questionnaire items indicated that the
   residents understood the purpose of the reflecting team approach and
   felt that they had acquired a variety of clinical skills from the
   approach, including listening and interviewing skills, positive
   reframing of patients' problems, how to give positive feedback to
   promote behavioral change, and increased knowledge of psychosocial
   assessment procedures and treatment methods. Conclusions: The residents'
   responses to the questionnaire items indicated that they perceived the
   reflecting team approach to be a practical and useful method for
   learning a variety of clinical skills.}},

Abstract = {{NIR velocity variations are compared with simultaneous visual light

   Our aim is to investigate the nature of the irregular light changes
   found in these variables.
   Light and velocity variations are correlated in all stars of our sample.
   Based on these results we discuss several possibilities to explain the
   observed behavior. We find that pulsation is responsible for large
   amplitude variations. In a recent paper Lebzelter (1999) invoked large
   convective cells to understand observed velocity variations. This
   possibility is discussed with respect to the observed correlation
   between light and velocity changes. In the light of these results we
   investigate the origin of the semiregular variations.}},

Abstract = {{The recent interest in cultural identities by a group of theorists that
   includes, most notably, Will Kymlicka and Charles Taylor revives an old
   debate on the nature and political consequences of these identities.
   These theorists, called culturalists in this article, have adopted a
   cultural approach to identity politics which tends to assume that
   cultural markers translate naturally and spontaneously into identities
   that are inherently political. This article argues that cultural
   identities and their political manifestations are not ``givens,{''} and
   that theorizing cultural identity politics should begin with questions
   on the processes of identity formation, transformation and
   politicization. It suggests turning to institutions to answer these
   questions, and finds in the historical institutionalist literature
   insight for theories of cultural identity politics. Historical
   institutionalism has been used primarily in the held of public policy,
   and its potential remains largely unexploited. It stresses the role of
   political institutions in shaping social and political outcomes, and
   holds that these outcomes are contextual and ``path dependent,{''} as
   they are shaped by varying institutional factors. This theoretical
   position makes historical institutionalism a particularly promising
   approach to explain the contingencies, fluctuations and irregularities
   of cultural identities and their political manifestations.}},

Abstract = {{Activating Region 1 of Escherichia coli FNR protein is proposed to
   interact directly with the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase alpha
   subunit (alpha CTD) during transcription activation at FNR-regulated
   promoters. Using an alpha CTD alanine scan mutant library, we have
   identified the residues of alpha CTD that are important for
   FNR-dependent transcription activation. Residues Asp-305, Gly-315,
   Arg-317, Leu-318 and Asp-319 are proposed to be the key residues in the
   contact site on alpha CTD for Activating Region 1 of FNR. in previous
   work, it had been shown that Activating Region 1 of FNR is a large
   surface-exposed patch and that the two crucial amino acid residues are
   Thr-118 and Ser-187. In this work, we have constructed Arg-118 FNR and
   Arg-187 FNR and shown that both FNR derivatives are defective in
   transcription activation. However, the activity of FNR carrying Arg-118
   can be partially restored by substitutions of Lys-304 in alpha CTD.
   Similarly, the activity of FNR carrying Arg-187 can be partially
   restored by substitutions of Arg-317 or Leu-318 in alpha CTD. The
   specificity of the restoration suggests that, during transcription
   activation by FNR, the side-chain of residue 118 in Activating Region 1
   of FNR is located close to Lys-304 and Asp-305 in alpha CTD. Similarly,
   the side-chain of residue 187 in Activating Region 1 of FNR is located
   close to Arg-317 and Leu-318 in alpha CTD. These results can be used to
   model the interface between Activating Region 1 of FNR and its contact
   target in alpha CTD, and permit comparison of this interface with the
   interface between Activating Region 1 of the related transcription
   activator, CRP and alpha CTD.}},

   each reference standard dissolved in 3 year old grain whisky at 23 \%
   (v/v) ethanol using both ascending dilution series and Latin square
   presentations. With the former order effects and errors of habituation
   and anticipation were apparent. However, the Latin square presentation
   was satisfactory for threshold measurements in whisky, yielding good
   correlations and reproducibility, and enabling outliers to be reassessed
   independently. Slopes obtained from plotting probit against
   concentration for detection and recognition data, psychometric functions
   of aroma perception, varied between reference compounds and 90\%
   recognition concentrations were obtained for each aroma standard.
   Sixteen of the compounds assessed were suitable for use as reference
   flavour standards for training of whisky assessors.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new approach is proposed to design decentralized
   controllers for multi-unit plants that display nonlinear behaviour. The
   design method uses two measures that characterize stability and
   performance of a controller that has been derived from a particular
   design model. These measures are derived from robust control theory and
   permit the whole operating space, as determined by analysis of the
   disturbance variables, to be partitioned into sub-regions. The
   controller design models are derived by a consideration of the value of
   variables in a particular operating sub-region, as well as a particular
   decentralised control structure. In each sub-region, one controller is
   shown to produce increased stability and/or performance over other
   possible decentralised control structures. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The high-temperature (T = 1623 K) transformations of olivine single
   crystals in contact with graphite powder have been studied on time
   scales of hours to days by scanning electron microscopy, transmission
   electron microscopy, and electron microprobe. Microstructures have been
   characterized in a reaction layer composed of Fe-Ni precipitates and
   iron-depleted olivine, which developed between the surface and an inner
   reaction front. Composition profiles of Mg, Si, Fe, and O (direct
   measurement, no assumption for stoichiometry) have been determined in
   the reaction layer, which is characterized by oxygen and silicon losses,
   constant Si/O ratio, and constant total Fe content. A detailed study of
   the reaction layer has shown that it contains indeed two reaction fronts
   (inner and outer) corresponding, respectively, to the beginning of metal
   precipitation and to the total depletion of Fe2+ from olivine.
   The propagation of the two reaction fronts located at position I as a
   function of run duration, t, follows a parabolic law: l = root k . t The
   two rate constants, k, are equal to 5.0 +/- 0.5 x 10(-15) m(2) s(-1) and
   3.1 +/- 0.1 x 10(-14) m(2) s(-1) for the inner and outer fronts,
   respectively. A numerical modelling in finite differences is proposed
   for testing the parameters involved in the propagation of the reaction
   fronts. Propagation of chemical fronts appears mainly rate limited by
   the interdiffusion of iron/nickel and magnesium in the olivine lattice.
   Transport and volatilization of oxygen and silicon from the interior to
   the surface are not rate limiting and probably involve defects allowing
   fast effective diffusion for these elements.
   This coupled reduction/volatilization reaction has the potential of
   fractionating (Fe/Si) and (Mg/Si) ratios in olivines processed at high
   temperatures under reducing conditions. We have evidenced that chemical
   and microstructural observations made in ``dusty olivines{''} from
   chondrules in unequilibrated type 3 chondrites could be explained by the
   reactions described in this study. Coupling this result with the kinetic
   data suggests that ``dusty olivines{''} could have been generated by
   transitory thermal events with cumulative durations of a few hours.

Abstract = {{The Hunt Mo skarn deposit is one of the best examples of a late
   tectonic, granitic pegmatite-related, skarn system in the Grenville
   province. An Re-Os age of 1069 +/- 11 Ma was obtained from a molybdenite
   crystal (6.4 ppm Re) hosted in proximal skarn (sample 50O) consistent
   with a contact metasomatic origin related to the granitic body. Although
   less evolved than other Grenvillian pegmatites, the Condon Lake granitic
   pegmatite is a low-temperature, A-type intrusion, with moderate redox
   characteristics. In contrast to many Mo-bearing skarns in the region,
   this deposit has low U, Th, REE, F, and P contents. The reduced marginal
   magnesian skarn is well zoned geochemically, mineralogically, and
   texturally from the contact outward into the dominant graphite-bearing
   calc-silicate-calcite-dolomite marble, which is locally intercalated
   with clinopyoxenite, orthoamphibolite, and pyoxene-biotite
   quartzofeldspathic gneiss. A narrow zone of endoskarn (<1 m; scapolite-K
   feldspar-Ca clinopyroxene) and wider, zoned exoskarn (<10 m;
   scapolite-Ca clinopyroxene (proximal), Ca clinopyoxene-phlogopite, Ca
   clinopyroxene-tremolite-phlogopite, tremolite-phlogopite (distal),
   marble), which hosts the bulk of the primary molybdenite (+/-
   pyrrhotite) and minor secondary pyrite-pyrrhotite molybdenite veins. In
   addition to the obvious Si, Fe, Ti, Mn, S, and Mo addition, Cu, Zn, Y,
   Nb, and Zr are also slightly enriched. The high f((H2O))/f((HF)) ratios
   (138,000-204,000) and moderate f((H2O))/f((HCl)) ratios (2,200-1,000) at
   the Hunt deposit contrast with the lower fugacity ratios from other
   Mo-bearing U-Th-REE skarns in the region, indicating that Mo transport
   and deposition is principally related to a hydroxide complex.
   The calc-silicate phase equilibria used to describe the zonation
   sequence have been reinterpreted using quartz-undersaturated (silica)
   activities; this shifts the calc-silicate-forming reaction boundaries to
   very low X-(CO2) (<0.005), consistent with decarbonation reactions
   induced via dissolved silica infiltration. The modeled fluid/rock in the
   skarn based on dissolved molybdenum is greater than 20. The carbon and
   oxygen isotopes of calcite are consistent with infiltrative metasomatic
   skarns from the pegmatite and a dominantly igneous source for the sulfur
   (delta(34)S = 2-9 parts per thousand). Overall, the deposition of Mo is
   probably facilitated by a reaction with carbonate (increase in
   Ca(OH)(2), CaCl2 resulting in complex destabilization), a decrease in
   f(O2) triggering an increase H2S/SO2, S in the host rocks (f(S2)), and a
   slight decrease in temperature (650 degrees-500 degrees C).}},

Abstract = {{Renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) and renal blood flow (RBF) both
   show oscillations at various frequencies but the functional significance
   and regulation of these oscillations is not well understood. To
   establish whether the strength of these oscillations is under
   differential control we measured the frequency spectrum of RSNA and RBF
   following volume expansion in conscious rabbits. Seven days prior to
   experiment animals underwent surgery to implant an electrode for
   recording renal nerve activity and a flow probe for recording RBF.
   Volume expansion (Haemaccel, 1.5 ml min(-1) kg(-1) for 15 min) resulted
   in a 25+/-5\% decrease in mean RSNA, paralleled by an increase in RBF to
   60+/-12 mi min(-1) from resting levels of 51+/-11 ml min(-1). Renal
   denervated rabbits did not show an increase in RBF with volume
   expansion. Arterial baroreflexes were unaltered by volume expansion.
   Spectral analysis of the different frequencies in RSNA showed
   oscillations in RSNA between 0.2 and 0.4 Hz were selectively decreased
   following volume expansion (14+/-3 to 6+/-1\% of total power in RSNA at
   <3 fit). A corresponding decrease in the strength of oscillations in RBF
   at this frequency was also seen (20 +/- 6 to 8 +/- 2\%). In contrast,
   the strength of respiratory (0.8-2.0 Hz) and cardiac (3-6 Hz) related
   rhythms did not change with volume expansion. These results show that
   selective changes in the different frequency components of RSNA can
   occur. We suggest that input from cardiopulmonary receptors and/or other
   vascular beds, and/or altered vascular resistance after volume expansion
   can reduce the strength of the 0.3 Hz oscillation independent of changes
   in arterial baroreflex control of RSNA. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier

   WHOQOL-100, which are World Health Organization instruments for
   evaluation of quality of life (QOL) which include four dimensions
   (physical, psychological, environmental, social relations). The use of
   this tool with psychiatric patients is discussed. Collection of data was
   performed during a national inquiry on persons with neuromuscular
   disorders. The population included 2 102 subjects (mean age 42,9 +/- 15
   years). Ten different clinical entities were represented, which differed
   in the type of lesion of the motor unit, the permanence and localization
   of the loss of muscle strength, the progression of the respiratory
   deficit, the moment of its occurrence and seriousness of prognosis. This
   questionnaire was well-adapted to the study population (weak effect of
   extremes) and was well-accepted (only 5 \% non-responses). Compared with
   the long version, homogeneity is less pronounced, but remains acceptable
   (the item-scale correlation is superior to 0,40 for 66,7 \% of some
   items), which is the same as the reliability (Cronbach's alpha
   coefficient always over 0,65). The sensitivity in relation to the
   diagnosis is verified for all four dimensions (p = 0,05). The concurrent
   validity, studied using general QOL evaluation scores, satisfaction with
   health, and the importance of repercussions of incapacities on daily
   life was also globally demonstrated (p < 0,0001).}},

Abstract = {{Objectives-To develop a transarterial coil embolization technique for
   occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA), external carotid artery
   (ECA), and maxillary arteries (MA) in normal horses and to evaluate this
   technique for prevention of hemorrhage in horses affected with guttural
   pouch mycosis.
   Animals-Ten adult, normal horses and 4 horses with guttural pouch
   mycosis.
   Methods-All horses had transarterial coil embolization of the rostral
   and caudal ICA, caudal MA, and rostral EGA. In I affected horse, an
   aberrant actively bleeding branch of the ECA was also occluded. Normal
   horses had a premortem angio,sram, and were killed either at 1 or 2
   weeks or 1, 2, or 3 months after the procedure. Specimens from the ICA,
   ECA and MA were evaluated by light microscopy.
   Results-No surgical complications were observed, except 1 horse that
   developed laryngeal hemiplegia and 1 pilot horse that had embolization
   of the cerebral arterial circle. In normal horses, premortem angiography
   confirmed complete occlusion of all vessels, and coils were positioned
   as intended. All normal horses had partially maturing to mature,
   continuous thrombi occluding at the coils. In affected horses, no
   further episodes of epistaxis were observed. By day 60, all mycotic
   plaques had resolved without further treatment. Ophthalmic complications
   were not observed.
   Conclusion-Transarterial embolization provided a safe, rapid, and
   effective method for ICA, EGA, and MA occlusion in normal and affected
   horses. In affected horses, the technique was possible despite active
   bleeding, allowing adequate identification and occlusion of all sources
   of hemorrhage. (C) Copyright 2000 by The American College of Veterinary

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine the reliability of blood cultures obtained
   through indwelling arterial lines as compared to that of blood cultures
   obtained by venipuncture.
   Design: A prospective observational study.
   Setting: Six-bed mixed medical surgical intensive care unit (ICU) of a
   550-bed university-affiliate medical center.
   Measurements: During a 3-month period blood culture sets, when
   clinically indicated, were drawn in parallel from indwelling arterial
   catheters and one-time venipuncture and the results compared. Each blood
   sample consisted of 15 mi and was distributed equally between three
   blood culture bottles: aerobic, anaerobic and one aerobic
   resin-containing bottle. Blood culture results from the two sources were
   compared according to preset definitions.
   Main results: During the study period 90 parallel blood culture sets
   (540 bottles) were obtained from 36 patients. Forty-three (16\%)
   venipuncture bottles were positive versus 88 (32 \%) arterial line
   culture battles (p < 0.001). Of the parallel sets, 83\% yielded
   equivalent results - either both sterile or both growing the same
   organism. Amongst the discordant sets, the arterial line cultures grew
   37 gram-positive and 18 gram-negative isolates not found in venipuncture
   sets (i.e. 50 \% of 109 arterial line isolates), while only two
   gram-positive isolates were solely grown in venipuncture cultures (4 \%
   of all 55 venipuncture isolates, p < 0.001). On clinical correlation,
   all the gram-positive organisms in the discordant cultures were found
   nor to reflect bacteremia, while five of the 18 gram-negative isolates
   (28 \%) grown only in arterial line cultures probably did reflect
   ongoing bacteremia.
   Conclusion: The results of blood cultures taken from the arterial line
   are frequently equivalent to those taken from venipuncture. When
   discordant, the growth of gram-positive bacteria almost certainly
   reflects contamination or arterial line colonization, whereas the growth
   of gram-negative bacteria may have to be considered as reflecting
   bacteremia.}},

Abstract = {{An extension to the kinetic Monte Carlo simulation technique was
   developed in order to study thin film deposition and growth of a system
   approximating polycrystalline silicon. This method was developed to
   determine the effect of varying the angle of incidence of an atomic beam
   on the morphology of a poly-Si thin him grown on a crystalline Si
   substrate. This deposition procedure produced material comprised of
   individual grains, all with identical orientation; a first step towards
   modelling poly-Si. The addition of such grains does not significantly
   affect the bulk film properties relative to the single crystal case. The
   number of initial grains chosen to represent a set of pre-existing
   grains on the surface does not affect the gross morphology of the grown
   film once around 40 monolayers have been deposited. The chief advantage
   of this polycrystalline-like system is that it allows the observation of
   both columnar growth (at angles below about 65 degrees) and dendritic
   growth at angles above this value; growth of single crystalline material
   only shows the latter. This fact allows a comparison of results from
   atomic-scale simulation to existing theories that relate the angle of
   the morphological features of the grown film to the angle of the
   incident beam. We show that the simulation data are not particularly
   well represented by commonly used theories such as the tangent rule, or
   that due to Tait et al (1993 Thin Solid Films 226 196). Increased angles
   of incidence cause faster extinction of grains until a steady-state
   Value of the number of grains is reached. When gains are nucleated on a
   heterogeneous substrate, here chosen as a crude description of Si on
   glass, increased substrate temperature results in larger grains, and
   higher angles of incidence result in fewer nucleated grains due to
   non-local shadowing.}},

Abstract = {{Children with visual impairments are reported to be delayed in producing
   pretend play in naturalistic settings. This study examined the play of
   18 children with visual impairments aged between 21 and 86 months on two
   structured tests of play. Appropriate functional play with miniature
   versions of everyday objects was distinguished from symbolic play
   involving substituting one object for another, pretending something has
   a property it does not have, or referring to something as if it were
   present. As a group, the children showed impaired functional and
   symbolic play. However, four children met the diagnostic criteria for
   autism and engaged in little or no play. When these children were
   excluded, the remaining children had lower functional play test scores
   than expected for their chronological age, but symbolic play test scores
   which were at the appropriate level for their chronological age. The
   functional and symbolic play of children with no vision or only light
   perception did nor differ significantly from children with some vision.
   The production of symbolic play was strongly related to language
   ability, although functional play was not related to language ability.
   It is argued that children with visual impairment, but no behaviours
   characteristic of autism, can develop the ability to play both
   functionally and symbolically, but that lack of visual access to play
   materials may limit their ability to demonstrate these skills.}},

Abstract = {{A binary competition experiment between carrot (Daucus carota L.) and
   Chenopodium album L. was conducted in a greenhouse at seven population
   densities and eight nutrient concentrations to investigate the effects
   of a nutrient gradient on plant competition in both monocultures and
   mixtures. The patterns of carrot biomass allocation (measured as
   root:shoot ratio) in monocultures and mixtures with C. album were
   affected by both nutrient availability and population density.
   Chenopodium album had a broader response to nutrient concentrations than
   carrot. The maximum yield of carrot in both monocultures and mixtures
   occurred at fourfold the standard concentration of nutrients, while C.
   album in both monocultures and mixtures had the maximum yield at 16-fold
   the standard nutrient concentration. The yield-density relationship of
   carrot tended to be increasing or asymptotic at lower nutrient
   concentrations but parabolic at higher concentrations, whereas that of
   C. album was little affected by nutrient availability. Nutrient
   availability had a profound influence on the competitive relationships
   between the two species: at both low and high nutrient concentrations,
   C. album tended to be more competitive than carrot, while at
   intermediate levels of nutrients, carrot was more competitive than C.
   album. Our results suggest that in relation to competitive performance,
   the weed has a greater ability to adapt itself to varying environments
   than does the crop. Additionally, the relative merits of the
   quantitative measures of competitive ability are briefly discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Deer antlers and their antecedent pedicles are made up of two
   components, interior osseocartilage and exterior integument. In a
   previous study, we described that histogenesis of the interior
   osseocartilage proceeds through four ossification stages. These are
   intramembranous (IMO), transition (OPC), pedicle endochondral (pECO),
   and antler endochondral (aECO). In the present study, we used
   histological techniques to examine pedicle skin formation and its
   transformation to antler velvet. The results showed that pedicle skin
   initiated from the apex of a frontal lateral crest and was formed
   through three distinctive stages. These stages are 1) compression of the
   subcutaneous loose connective tissue at the OPC stage, 2) stretching of
   the undulated epidermis at the early pECO stage, and 3) neogenesis of
   the skin and its associated appendages at the mid pECO stage.
   Transformation into antler velvet, which occurs at the late pECO stage,
   is mainly associated with alteration in the skin appendages. This
   alteration includes the loss of arrector pill muscle and sweat glands,
   and the gain of the large bi- or multi-lobed sebaceous glands. These
   results suggest that pedicle skin expansion occurs to release the
   mechanical tension created by underlying forming antlerogenic tissue,
   initially in response to it by mechanical stretch, and then by
   neogenesis of shin. In turn, the stretched pedicle skin may exert
   mechanical pressure on the underlying antlerogenic tissue causing it to
   change in ossification type. Antler velvet generation may be
   accomplished by both mechanical stimulation and chemical induction from
   the underlying pECO stage antlerogenic tissue. If this hypothesis is
   correct it is likely that mechanical stimulation would drive skin
   formation and chemical induction then determine skin type. Furthermore,
   asynchronous transformation of the interior and exterior components
   during pedicle formation and antler generation may result from the
   delayed chemical induction and the way antler velvet initially
   generates. The results from both mitotic cell labelling of the basal
   layer and ultrastructure of the basement membrane of the apical skin in
   the study support these hypotheses. Anat Rec 260:62-71, 2000. (C) 2000

Volume = {{165}},

Abstract = {{Cyclosporin A (CsA) has been shown to be efficacious in protecting
   against ischemic injury after short periods (5 to 10 min) of forebrain
   ischemia. The present experiments were undertaken to study if a long
   period of forebrain ischemia (30 min), induced at a brain temperature of
   37 degrees C, is compatible with survival and if the brain damage
   incurred can be ameliorated by CsA. The results showed that animals
   subjected to 30 min of forebrain ischemia at a brain temperature of 37
   degrees C failed to survive after the first 24 h of recovery and showed
   extensive neuronal necrosis in all selectively vulnerable regions after
   1 day of survival. CsA, when injected in combination with an
   intracerebral lesion to open the blood-brain barrier, markedly prolonged
   the survival time. CsA-injected animals also showed amelioration of
   histological lesions, an effect that was sustained for at least 4 days.
   Experiments with mitochondria isolated from the neocortex and
   hippocampus showed that state 3 respiratory rates decreased during
   ischemia, recovered after 1 and 3 h of recirculation, and then showed a
   secondary decline at 6 h. Administration of CsA prevented this secondary
   decline. Measurements of neocortical cerebral blood flow showed that
   there was no secondary hypoperfusion prior to secondary mitochondrial
   dysfunction, implying that changes in blood flow may not be responsible
   for the rapidly developing, secondary brain damage. The results thus
   demonstrate that if brain temperature is upheld at 37 degrees C, a
   30-min period of ischemia is not compatible with survival after the
   first day of recovery, and gross histopathological damage develops
   within that period. CsA was efficacious in prolonging animal survival,
   ameliorating brain damage, and preventing the secondary mitochondrial
   dysfunction. Since CsA blocks: the mitochondrial permeability transition
   pore its action may, at least in part, be on mitochondrial integrity and
   function. (C) 2000 Academic Press.}},

   test-pairs with pre-determined fault coverage, a deterministic TPG is
   synthesized to apply the given test-pair set in a limited test time. To
   achieve this objective, configurable linear feedback shift register
   (LFSR) structures are used. Techniques are developed to synthesize such
   a TPG, which is used to generate an unordered deterministic test pair

Abstract = {{Following the successful development of a bistable electromagnetic
   switchgear actuator for driving vacuum interrupters in an autorecloser,
   several MV switchgear companies have begun to develop similar actuators
   for use in autoreclosers powered by primary lithium batteries. However,
   many of these actuators consume excessive energy in operation, adding
   undesirable battery cost to the equipment. A model is developed that
   enables these actuators to be optimised in energy terms, since it
   simulates the electrical. magnetic and mechanical effects seen by the
   actuator and their interactions. The model is a detailed lumped
   reluctance type. The lumped reluctances were defined after inspecting
   the results of the finite element analysis of a generic actuator. The
   model uses iteration routines to calculate the flux distribution within
   it and an improved stochastic optimal method to obtain an optimal
   design, in terms of magnet cost and operating energy usage. Simulated
   and test results are presented, and these show a close correlation.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Pheochromocytomas are rare tumors that originate in chromaffin tissue
   and produce their distant variant effects by secretion of
   catecholamines, tending to mislead the emergency physicians to a wrong
   diagnosis. Therefore, we analyze the clinical cardiovascular
   manifestations in patients with pheochromocytoma to improve the
   diagnostic ability of the emergency physicians. All patients presenting
   to the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital between January 1993 and December
   1997 with a final diagnosis of pheochromocytoma had their charts
   reviewed, The data of 25 patients including age, sex, adrenergic
   stimulation presentations, electrocardiographic changes, location of the
   tumor, and complications were analyzed, Hypertension was the most
   important major manifestation and fluctuation of blood pressure drew our
   attention to the possibility of pheochromocytoma. Six patients had
   abnormal electrocardiographic ST-T segment changes. Five of them had
   chest pain which prompted them to undergo coronary angiography before
   surgery, because acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina and acute
   myocardial infarction) was suspected initially. However, all of them
   turned out to have normal coronary arteries. Fight-sided
   pheochromocytoma was found in three of these five patients. We should
   maintain high index of suspicion for pheochromocytoma in patients
   presenting with chest pain, fluctuating blood pressure, and ischemic
   electrocardiogram (ECG) changes despite any typical isoenzyme changes,
   Pheochromocytoma should also be included in the differential diagnosis
   of acute coronary syndrome because acute catecholamine secretion may
   induce chest pain and abnormal ECG changes mimicking an ischemic
   episode. The right-sided pheochromocytoma may present more striking
   electrocardiographic abnormalities and clinical manifestations.

Abstract = {{Asian lamivudine trial has shown that hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)
   seroconversion rate during 1 year of lamivudine therapy was only 16\%
   but was 64\% in the subgroup of patients with a pretherapy serum alanine
   transaminase (ALT) level over 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN).
   To test whether ALT rebound following corticosteroid priming enhances
   response to lamivudine therapy, a pilot study was conducted in 30
   patients with ALT levels less than 5 x ULN (43-169; N < 36 U/L), They
   received 30 mg of prednisolone daily for 3 weeks, 15 mg daily for 1
   week, no treatment for 2 weeks, and then 150 mg of lamivudine daily for
   9 months. Complete response (CR) was defined as ALT normalization with
   HBV-DNA seroclearance and HBeAg seroconversion. Peripheral blood
   mononuclear cell proliferation and cytokine secretion in response to
   recombinant HBV core antigen were serially assayed in 7 patients during
   priming and after withdrawal of prednisolone, Clinical rebound with an
   ALT over 5 x ULN was observed in 20 patients (67\%), Of these 20, 12
   (60\%) showed CR as compared with 1 (10\%) of the 10 patients without
   significant ALT rebound (P < .002), The HBeAg seroconversion sustained
   in 70\% of the patients 3 to 6 months after the end of lamivudine
   therapy, Immunological assays revealed that the responders showed Th1
   dominant response and higher stimulation index to prednisolone priming.
   No serious side effect was encountered, These results suggest that
   corticosteroid priming induced immune/ALT rebound greatly enhances
   response to lamivudine therapy in chronic hepatitis B, Confirmation by
   randomized controlled trial is needed.}},

Abstract = {{Context: Despite drops in U.S. teenage birthrates, questions continue to
   arise about how best to reduce the country's adolescent birthrate.
   School-based programs continue to be considered one of the best ways to
   reach adolescents at risk of early sexual activity.
   Methods: A total of 312 students completed a pretest, a posttest and a
   follow-up one year after the posttest: 125 who had participated in a
   3-4-month-long abstinence-based small-group intervention led by trained
   social workers, and 187 in a comparison group that received no special
   services.
   Results: There were few significant differences between the intervention
   and comparison groups at posttest At the one-year follow-up, however,
   intervention students had significantly better scores on locus of
   control, their relationship with their parents and (among males only)
   their attitudes about the appropriateness of teenage sex. Measures of
   depression, self-esteem, intentions to have sex, attitudes toward
   teenage pregnancy and various behaviors did not differ significantly
   between groups. By the time of the one-year follow-up, there was no
   difference between study groups among females in the initiation of
   sexual intercourse. Among the males, initiation of sexual intercourse
   appeared to be higher in the intervention group than in the comparison
   group, but the difference was not statistically significant Positive
   outcomes were especially limited among students who were already
   sexually active at the start of the study a finding that emphasizes the
   difficulties of reaching adolescents who are already at high risk for
   pregnancy.
   Conclusions: A small-group abstinence-based intervention focusing on
   mental health can have some impact on adolescents' attitudes and
   relationships (particularly with their parents). Longterm evaluations
   are important for determining the effects of an intervention, as it is
   difficult to change adolescent risk behavior.}},

Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{The study is based on the model of sound perception that involves two
   systems of measuring the frequency of the sound being perceived. The
   system of analyzing the periodicity of,spike sequence in axons of
   neurons innervating the internal auditory hair cells excited by the
   running wave is less pricise, but it provides the estimation of the
   frequency of any periodical sounds. Exact measurement of the frequency
   of the sinusoidal sound occurs from the spikes in axons of neurones
   innervating the internal, hair cells of the auditory reception field,
   which uses the entire train of waves excited by this sound in the
   critical layer of the waveguide of the internal ear cochlea, which
   corresponds to the frequency of the sound. The octave effect is
   explained in terms of the fact that the spectrum of frequencies of
   speech sounds, singing and music coincides with the region of the
   audibility range in which the impulses of the auditory nerve fibers are
   synchronized by incoming signals. The Octave similarity, i.e., the
   similarity ill the sounding of harmonic signals, whose frequencies
   relate as even numbers (2:1, etc.), is explained by an unambiguous match
   between the sound frequency and pulse rate hi auditory fibers coming
   from the auditory reception field. The presence in the brain posterior
   tubercles of multipeak neurons whose peaks are in octave ratio, confirm
   the crucial role of the system of exact measurement of frequency in the
   phenomenon of octave similarity. The phenomenon of diplacusis, which is
   particularly pronounced in persons with Menier disease, is caused by
   changes in the position of the auditory reception field in the diseased
   ear as compared with the healthy ear. The alternating switching of
   reception from one ear to the other is related to a disturbance of the
   unitary image of pitch.}},

Abstract = {{There is a time delay between the final recruitment of patients to a
   randomized controlled trial and the publication of results. The
   practical options available to decision makers during this gap can be
   listed according to whether all treatments are already widely available
   or whether at least one has been restricted to the trial. When the
   treatments are already in widespread use, the options are simply either
   to stop randomizing or to continue. When one trial treatment is
   restricted, there are further options: a) withdraw the restricted
   treatment altogether, pending the final analysis; b) continue to offer
   randomization, with a view to providing further data should these be
   needed; or c) make the intervention widely available to patients who
   would have previously been eligible for the trial. In this paper, we
   discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of each option and
   discuss their attendant ethical implications. In particular, we suggest
   that continuing randomization is an option worthy of serious
   consideration. Randomizing patients acts as a ``hedge{''} against the
   need for more data, given that sample size calculation is an inexact
   science. However, patients must be made aware of the basis on which
   randomization is offered.}},

Abstract = {{An inverse scattering method that uses eigenfunctions of a scattering
   operator at a single frequency is extended to include the full range of
   frequencies present in the incident pulse waveform. The resulting
   so-called time-domain eigenfunction method is shown to yield a modulated
   version of the scattering potential. The potential is recovered by a
   demodulation process using cross correlation with a reference. Including
   an adaptive delay in the reference is shown to compensate partially for
   the linearization of the Born approximation and to extend its valid
   range. The k-space window of the time-domain solution is expressed in
   terms of the incident waveform and shown to be smoother than that of a
   single-frequency solution. The time-domain method is examined using both
   calculated and measured data. In the calculations, an exact solution for
   scattering from one or multiple nonconcentric cylinders is used to
   obtain the scattered field. In the measurements, a novel ring-transducer
   system was employed to obtain the incident and total fields. The results
   of simulations and experiments show that the method is robust and
   accurate for the size of objects considered and that the point
   resolution approaches one-half the wavelength at the pulse center
   frequency. (C) 2000 Acoustical Society of America.

Abstract = {{Feeding and passage of nutrient particles through the digestive tract of
   the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis was examined using the following types
   of particles: yeast cells, mammalian (human, bovine, ovine) erythrocytes
   and erythrocyte-ghosts. The decrease of erythrocytes within the medium
   was found to follow first order kinetics. The rate constant was
   influenced by the density of rotifers, as well as by the initial density
   of particles in suspension at the beginning of the experiment. Passage
   of particles through the digestive tract depended on the supply of fresh
   particles taken up by the wheel organ. Passage time approximately
   doubled when the rotifers had no access to fresh particles. On provision
   of fresh particles, the contents of the digestive tract were expelled
   even if they included absorbable substances. The contents of the
   digestive tract of B. plicatilis can be quickly and easily exchanged by
   introducing a new type of particle to the medium. By replacing
   fluorescence-labelled erythrocyte ghosts with unlabelled ghosts,
   residual fluorescence indicating absorptive processes could be
   demonstrated.}},

   the polymerization step, loading capacity, silane spacing, and the
   relative distance of the silane moieties from the resin core can be
   controlled. The consistently high-loading Rasta silane resins produced
   can be easily converted into either a reactive silyl chloride or
   triflate to subsequently anchor alcohols and phenols to the solid phase.
   Cleavage from the resin can be mediated by treatment with HF pyridine,

Title = {{Levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine receptors in abstinent,

   single photon emission tomography study}},
Journal = {{ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Although alcohol dependence in women is an increasing
   problem, little is known about the effects of alcohol on the female
   brain. Evidence from a few structural and functional neuroimaging
   studies suggests that the female brain may be more susceptible than the
   male brain to the harmful effects of alcohol. However, no in vivo
   studies of the neuropharmacology of alcohol dependence in women have
   been carried out. The aim of this preliminary study was to test the
   hypothesis that alcohol dependence in women is associated with greater
   reduction in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-benzodiazepine receptor
   levels than in men with an equivalent drinking history.
   Methods: We used single photon emission tomography and I-123-iomazenil
   to label the central GABA-benzodiazepine receptor and to compare
   semiquantified levels in 9 abstinent alcohol-dependent and 13 control
   women. These groups were further compared with equivalent male groups
   from a previous study.
   Results: There was a trend toward a reduction in GABA-benzodiazepine
   receptor levels in alcohol-dependent women, but this did not reach
   significance. These lower levels were seen primarily in the cerebellum,
   occipital lobes, and parietal cortex (left > right). This was in marked
   contrast with the pattern of reduction seen in the previous study of
   male dependence, where significant reductions were seen primarily in the
   frontal cortex.
   Conclusions: Due to the semiquantitative analysis performed and the
   relatively small number of subjects in this study, which resulted in a
   nonsignificant trend, we can only comment on the differences in the
   pattern of lower levels of GABA-benzodiazepine receptors seen in alcohol
   dependence in men and women. Although we are not able to ascertain
   whether the female brain is more susceptible to the effects of alcohol,
   it appears that alcohol has a differential effect on the central
   GABA-benzodiazepine receptors in men and women. Recent animal evidence
   supports this hypothesis. Future studies should explore whether other
   neuropharmacological differences exist between men and women in alcohol
   dependence that could have implications for pharmacotherapy.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of oxidation on the chemical characteristics of myosin,

   exhibited a marked increase (>10-fold) in carbonyls, a small increase in
   amines and conversion of some free sulphhydryls to disulphide bonds.
   Oxidised beta-lactoglobulin and 7S globulin also showed a major increase
   in the carbonyl content (five- and threefold respectively), but other
   chemical changes were relatively minor. In the oxidised
   myosin/beta-lactoglobulin composites, some cross-linked aggregates were
   formed. Aggregation was also evidenced in the myosin/7S globulin
   composites exposed to the oxidising agents. The results indicated that
   oxidation enhanced interactions of the non-muscle proteins with myosin

Abstract = {{AIM: To study the effect of triptolide on the activity of nuclear
   factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) and gene expression of I kappa B alpha, a
   major inhibitor of NF-kappa B, in human Jurkat T cell line. METHODS:
   Jurkat cells treated with or without PMA/PHA were incubated with varied
   doses of triptolide for different time periods. The activity of NF-kappa
   B in Jurkat cells was measured with electrophoretic mobility shift
   assays (EMSA), and the mRNA expression of I kappa B alpha in Jurkat
   cells was detected by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase
   chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: PMA/PHA treatment was found to induce
   NF-kappa B activation rapidly. Triptolide treatment decreased the
   activity of NF-kappa B in both PMA/PHA treated and untreated Jurkat
   cells. This effect of triptolide was in a dose-dependent manner and was
   more obvious in cells treated with PMA/PHA. The mRNA expression of I
   kappa B alpha were upregulated by triptolide, while this effect was more
   potent in cells without PMA/PHA treatment. CONCLUSION: Triptolide is a
   potent inhibitor of NF-kappa B activation in T lymphocyte and this
   effect is partly due to the upregulation of I kappa B alpha mRNA
   expression.}},

Abstract = {{We present a theoretical analysis of the stability of
   screening-photovoltaic (SP) spatial solitons in biased
   photovoltaic-photorefractive materials in the case of neglecting the
   loss of the material and the effect of diffusion. When an incident
   optical beam is a SP soliton, this beam propagates along a linear path
   with its shape kept unchanged. When the maximum amplitude, width and
   functional form of an incident optical beam are slightly different from
   those of a SP soliton, the beam reshapes itself and tries to evolve into
   a solitary wave after a short distance. That is, these SP solitons are
   stable against small perturbations. However, optical beams that
   significantly differ from SP soliton solutions tend to experience larger
   cycles of compression and expansion, and their maximum amplitudes
   oscillate with propagation distances. The larger the perturbations, the
   stronger the oscillation.}},

Abstract = {{ROL is a deductive object-oriented database system that has been

   complex objects, classes, class hierarchies, multiple inheritance with
   overriding and blocking, and schema definition. It also supports
   structured values such as functor objects and sets, treating them as
   first class citizens, and providing powerful mechanisms for representing
   both partial and complete information about sets. This paper describes
   its design and implementation. An important novel feature of the
   implementation is that it combines top-down and bottom-up evaluation
   strategies and automatically selects a strategy based on the nature of
   the query and data in the database.}},

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{In animal cells, capacitative calcium entry (CCE) mechanisms become
   activated specifically in response to depletion of calcium ions (Ca2+)
   from secretary organelles. CCE serves to replenish those organelles and
   to enhance signaling pathways that respond to elevated free Ca2+
   concentrations in the cytoplasm. The mechanism of CCE regulation is not
   understood because few of its essential components have been identified.
   We show here for the first time that the budding yeast Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae employs a CCE-like mechanism to refill Ca2+ stores within the
   secretary pathway, Mutants lacking Pmr1p, a conserved Ca2+ pump in the
   secretary pathway, exhibit higher rates of Ca2+ influx relative to
   wild-type cells due to the stimulation of a high-affinity Ca2+ uptake
   system. Stimulation of this Ca2+ uptake system nas blocked in pmr1
   mutants by expression of mammalian SERCA pumps. The high-affinity Ca2+
   uptake system was also stimulated in wild-type cells overexpressing
   vacuolar Ca2+ transporters that competed with Pmr1p for substrate. A
   screen for yeast mutants specifically defective in the high-affinity
   Ca2+ uptake system revealed two genes, CCH1 and MID1, previously
   implicated in Ca2+ influx in response to mating pheromones. Cch1p and
   Mid1p were localized to the plasma membrane, coimmunoprecipitated from
   solubilized membranes, and shown to function together within a single
   pathway that ensures that adequate levels of Ca2+ are supplied to Pmr1p
   to sustain secretion and growth. Expression of Cch1p and Mid1p was not
   affected in pmr1 mutants. The evidence supports the hypothesis that
   yeast maintains a homeostatic mechanism related to CCE in mammalian
   cells. The homology between Cch1p and the catalytic subunit of
   voltage-gated Ca2+ channels raises the possibility that in same
   circumstances CCE in animal cells may involve homologs of Cch1p and a
   conserved regulatory mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine if polycystic-appearing ovaries (PAO) are
   associated with differences in risk factors for cardiovascular disease
   among women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
   Design: Case-control sub-study.
   Setting: Division of Reproductive Endocrinology, Magee-Womens Hospital.
   Patient(s): Women with PCOS (n = 63) and non-PCOS controls (n = 56).
   Intervention: Transvaginal ultrasonography and single sample
   venipuncture.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Ultrasound ovarian appearance, fasting insulin,
   lipoproteins, androgens, LH/FSH ratio, anthropomorphic measurements, and
   blood pressure.
   Result(s): Women with PCOS had higher androgen and fasting insulin
   levels, a more adverse lipid profile, greater waist-hip and LH/FSH
   ratios, and a larger ovarian volume than controls. Thirty-three percent
   of the cases with PCOS, but only 5\% of controls, showed PAO on
   ultrasound study (P < .01). PCOS cases with and without PAO had
   comparable levels of fasting insulin, lipids, and blood pressures. PCOS
   cases with PAO had a higher LH/FSH ratio (P = .028), increased levels of
   serum androstenedione (P = .029) and testosterone (P = .055), and
   greater ovarian volume (P = .024) compared to non-PAO patients.
   Conclusion: Women with PCOS have greater cardiovascular risk than
   controls. Within PCOS cases, however, the ultrasound appearance of
   polycystic ovaries does not appear to further intensify the
   cardiovascular disease risk profile of these women. (Fertil Steril(R)

Abstract = {{The goal of engineering technology programs is to produce highly
   qualified graduates who are equipped to serve industry and society.
   Programs must provide students with not only practical experience, but
   also with critical thinking and technical skills that will enable them
   to solve problems and face challenges in their professional careers.
   Engineering technology programs must anticipate the future needs of
   industry to stay abreast of rapidly changing technological fields.
   The area of electromagnetic compatibility, interference, and
   susceptibility (EMC/EMI/EMS) will be a key issue for U.S. industry in
   the very near future. It is likely that U.S. regulatory agencies will
   issue new standards for this area in a manner similar to the European
   community, resulting in a demand for graduates with a background in
   EMC/EMI/EMS. While some electrical engineering schools already
   incorporate courses that address this topic into their curriculum, it is
   rare to find such courses in electrical engineering technology (EET)
   programs. This paper examines the impact of EMC/EMI/EMS on today's
   technology, addresses the need to incorporate these studies into EET
   programs, and suggests a course suitable for an EET program.}},

Abstract = {{A comparative study has been made of the room- and elevated-temperature
   tensile properties, room-temperature fracture toughness, fatigue-crack
   propagation rates, and 650 degrees C creep properties of
   Ti-24Al-14Nb-3V-0.5Mo with and without 0.9 at. pet Si. Both alloys have
   microstructures consisting of the alpha(2), B2, and the orthorhombic O
   phase, with different proportions of the alpha(2) phase relative to the
   (O + B2) mixtures, depending on solution-treatment temperature. The
   alloy with a Si addition contains additional primary zeta-Ti5Si3
   particles distributed in the (O + B2) matrix. Tests of mechanical
   properties showed that the incorporation of a small fraction (about 0.03
   by volume) of the Ti5Si3 phase lends to greater room-temperature and
   elevated-temperature strengths, but lower room-temperature elongations
   and fracture toughness as compared with the base alloy. Alloys
   containing greater volume fractions of the alpha(2) phase exhibited
   better tensile ductility and this was attributed to the concurrent
   stabilization of the B2 phase. Examination of tensile-tested and
   fatigued specimens indicates that the primary failure mode of the
   alloys, regardless of Si addition, was due to the brittleness of the
   alpha(2) phase; the silicide particles that debonded from the matrix
   also contribute to cracking in the monotonic loading mode. Up to a 20
   pet improvement in creep-rupture Life was observed in the Si-containing
   alloys, and this was interpreted in terms of the solute-strengthening
   effect of Si. While the incorporated Ti5Si3 phase has an unfavorable
   effect on ductility and room-temperature fracture toughness, the
   difference in fatigue-crack propagation rates between the alloys with
   and without Si is minimal. It is concluded that the controlling factor
   for the fatigue failure in orthorhombic alloys is related to the
   (alpha(2) + O + B2) microstructure, instead of the Ti5Si3 particles.}},

Number = {{5}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A novel approach to testing lookup table (LUT) based field programmable
   gate arrays (FPGAs) is proposed in this paper. A general structure for
   the basic configurable logic array blocks (CLBs) is assumed. We group k
   CLBs in the column into a cell, where k denotes the number of inputs or
   an LUT. The whole chip is configured as a group of one-dimensional
   iterative logic allays of cells. We assume that in each linear cell
   array, there is at most one faulty cell, and that multiple faulty CLBs
   in the same cell can be detected. For the LUT, a fault may occur at the
   memory matrix, decoder, input or output lines. The switch stuck-on and
   stuck-off fault models are adopted for multiplexers. New conditions for
   C-testability of programmable/reconfigurable arrays are also derived.
   Our idea is to configure the cells so as to make each cell function
   bijective. This property is helpful for applying pseudoexhaustive test
   patterns to each cell and propagating errors to the observable outputs.
   In order to detect all the faults defined, k + 2 configurations are
   required, and the resulting number of test patterns is 2(k). A novel
   built-in self-test structure is also proposed in this paper. The input
   patterns can be easily generated with a k-bit counter. The number of
   configurations for our BIST structures is 2k + 4. Our BIST approaches
   also have the advantage of requiring fewer hardware resources for test
   pattern generation and output response analysis. To locate a faulty CLB,
   three lest sessions are required. However, the maximum number of
   configurations for diagnosing a faulty CLB is k + 4.}},

Abstract = {{To estimate the resources required to manage patients with haemophilia
   in Scotland, we studied the demographic features, hospital admissions
   and causes of deaths for individuals with haemophilia A and B and von
   Willebrand disease, treated with blood products, during the period
   1980-94 living in central Scotland. Data were obtained from 413 adults
   and children (93\% ascertainment). The age distribution in 1980 revealed
   a paucity of individuals over 60 years but the number in this age group
   increased over the study period. Of those with haemophilia A and B, 63
   and two respectively, became HIV positive. Hospital admissions rose from
   103 to 168 per annum; the number of annual bed days utilized also
   increased, but there was marked annual fluctuation (790-1832). The rate
   of admission was greater for those with severe haemophilia A and this
   increased during the 15-year period mainly due to the clinical
   consequences of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus
   (HCV). The admission rate for haemophilia B was significantly lower than
   that for haemophilia A, and was similar for all degrees of severity of
   the disorder. Throughout the 15-year period the incidence of admissions
   for acute bleeds was constant, as was the average duration in hospital.
   For those with a factor VIII inhibitor, the rate of admission was about
   double the rate of those without an inhibitor, although the duration of
   hospital stay was similar for both groups. There were 61 deaths; the
   death rate increased during the study period principally due to HIV and
   HCV, and 12 patients died from haemorrhage. We conclude that: (i) the
   life expectancy for haemophiliacs in Scotland was generally increasing,
   although HIV and HCV caused increasing mortality and morbidity (as shown
   by the increase in hospital admissions); (ii) hospital bed usage for the
   treatment of acute bleeds continued to be required, but fluctuated
   greatly; and (iii) the clinical impression that haemophilia B is less
   clinically severe than haemophilia A is confirmed by objective data. The
   planning implications for haemophilia care in Scotland and similar
   countries are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Objective:To examine factors which sustain complementary therapy
   services in primary care in order to inform policy making in a context
   of rapid change. Design: In-depth qualitative case studies, including
   semi-structured interviews with key informants. Setting: 10 existing
   schemes of complementary therapy provision in primary care across
   England. Results: GPs and complementary practitioners reported
   wide-ranging benefits from complementary therapy provision in primary
   care. However, they felt that their ability to sustain complementary
   therapy provision was mediated by a) funding, b) the need For research,
   and c) appropriate service delivery mechanisms. a) Many schemes were the
   result of and sustained by personal vision. As such they had negotiated
   a variety of funding sources over a considerable period, against a
   background perception that continued funding was uncertain, b) Most
   informants believed that more research was needed to provide a solid
   evidence base for service continuation and development, in particular
   clinical and cost-effectiveness work. c) The manner of service delivery,
   notably whether a service was located within a general practice or in a
   referral centre, was seen as having implications for the integration of
   practitioners and for patient access to services. Conclusions: Current
   complementary therapy provision in primary care has developed on an `ad
   hoc' basis. In particular, the existence of GP fundholding in the 1990s,
   in which primary care physicians were able to purchase health services
   on a practice basis, facilitated the development of services in this
   way. Within the current Primary Care Group context, where purchasing
   decisions are made collectively by a group of general practices within a
   region, consideration needs to be given to both the continuity of
   schemes already in existence and to whether a more standardized approach
   to service development will be required to facilitate sustainable
   provision. (C) 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{It is shown that in the presence of carbon black, the decomposition rate
   of solid ammonium nitrate increases strongly (by more than seven orders
   of magnitude). The kinetic regularities of the decomposition in the
   temperature range 70-150 degreesC are established. At relatively low
   temperatures, the process proceeds by a two-stage mechanism with
   corresponding acceleration at each stage. At elevated temperatures, the
   first stage is absent. The decomposition rate is proportional to the
   amount of carbon black in the mixture. The activation energy for the
   decomposition (approximate to 30 kcal/mole) does not vary during
   transformation. Water decelerates the process. For a water content of
   approximate to (4-5)\%, an intermediate maximum of the deceleration is
   observed. The main gaseous decomposition product is N-2. The concurrent
   oxidation of carbon black is terminated by evolution of CO2. The
   mechanism of the chemical transformations is discussed using the results
   obtained and information available on the kinetics of individual
   reactions.}},

Abstract = {{The emergence of network-attached disks provides the possibility of
   transferring data between the storage system and the client directly.
   This offers new possibilities in building a distributed storage system.
   In this paper, we examine different storage organizations based on
   network-attached disks and compare the performance of these systems to a
   traditional system. Trace-driven simulations are used to measure the
   average response times of the client requests in two different
   workloads. We show that the advantages of distributing the server's
   network processing load to disks can be offset by losses in cache hits
   in a system based on network-attached disks. The two workloads we
   considered highlight this impact. We show that it is possible to offload
   significant load from the server by utilizing network-attached disks and
   point out that specific applications may be able to better exploit the
   features of network-attached disks.}},

Abstract = {{pH titration of the fluorescence of N-(1-naphthyl)aminoacetic acid(NAA)
   was performed in aqueous solution over pH range of 1.5-12.5. Despite no
   shift in the fluorescence maximum wavelength, the titration curve showed
   an Omega -shaped profile with increasing pH with two inflection points
   at pH 4.1 and pH 11.5, respectively. These values correspond to the
   excited-state pK(a){*}'s of carboxylic group and ammonium cation,
   respectively, which are both higher than those of the corresponding
   ground-state PKa' s of 2.64 and 11.83, of which the former changes more.
   The substantial weakening of the proton dissociation of carboxylic group
   in the excited state should be indicative of the decrease in the
   inductive + I-effect of the ammonium cation at the beta -position due to
   the excited-state intramolecular charge transfer from naphthalene moiety
   to ammonium. The latter was also confirmed by the slight increase in the
   exited-state pK(a2){*}. The fact that the increase in pK(s1){*} is
   larger than that in pK(a2){*} suggests that the effect of the
   intramolecular charge transfer on the involved moiety be weaker than
   that on a remote moiety in the same species. This could be taken into
   consideration for designing means of tuning the structures and
   properties of peptide and protein via photo-excitation, It was
   identified that the NAA zwitterion( Il) was the emissive species. The
   fluorescence quenching at high pH was assumed to be due to the
   photo-induced intramolecular electron transfer between carboxylate anion
   and the excited naphthalene moiety. The present cask represents an
   example in which both intramolecular charge transfer and electron
   transfer occur to shape the pH titration profile.}},

Title = {{Effects of workload level and 8-versus 12-h workday duration on test

Abstract = {{It is generally agreed that workday durations of 12 h or more are not
   advisable where workload levels are very high. However, there is no
   clear research basis for the identification of workload levels which
   should preclude the introduction of extended shifts. In the present
   study, the effects of varying workload levels and shift durations were
   investigated both in the laboratory and in a workplace. In the
   laboratory study subjects performed either cognitive work (two workload
   levels) or physically demanding work (heart rare maintained at 35
   beats/min above resting), and there were significant effects of both
   shift duration and workload level on various performance tests, bodily
   discomfort, hand steadiness and alertness. In the physically demanding
   condition, perceived workload was higher on 12 h days despite heart rare
   being unchanged. In a field study, 34 workers participating for three
   days each, half of them on 8 h days and half on 12-h days, workload data
   were obtained for each subject at each half-day data collection point.
   The combination of higher workload and 12-h workdays produced greater
   fatigue, as manifested in increased bodily discomfort, decreased
   alertness, decreased hand steadiness and increased errors on the
   grammatical reasoning task. In addition to these interacting effects of
   workload and work duration, there were main effects of both workload and
   work duration on bodily discomfort, and of workload on hand steadiness.
   Relevance to industry
   The results have relevance for managers and employees regarding the
   adoption of extended shift systems, particularly in relation to the
   nature of job demands, overall workload levels, and the criticality of
   human performance for system safety and efficiency. (C) 2000 Elsevier
